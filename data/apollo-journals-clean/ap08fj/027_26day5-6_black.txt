Apollo 8, Houston. We're handing over to Madrid in about 15 seconds. Over.
Roger. And good morning, Jerry, or good afternoon, or whatever it is.
Morning, Jim. It's about 6:30 in the morning [of December 26]. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read?
Loud and clear. How us?
Roger; the same.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Morning, Frank. Looks like we've lost the transducer on the Primary Radiator Out temperature. We're showing an off-scale high. The rest of the loop looks real fine, though. When you get a chance, would you take a look at it. See if you're in the same position. Over.
Which one is it?
Primary Radiator Out temperature.
Ours is showing 100 off-scale high, also.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Go. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. About this rad outlet temp: does your telemetry show that it happened all of a sudden?
That's affirmative, Bill.
Okay. I'm on malfunction 23, step 2. It looks to me there's like that there's a small possibility we might be boiling, but I doubt it. So you just want to hop over to step 4 and consider that a closed case. [Pause.]
Roger. We consider it closed.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Frank, all of your primary loop temperature readings look just fine. Your Evap In temperatures are normal and indicate you're getting normal mixing.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. For the P23 attitude that you're in right now, your quad tank temperatures are better than we expected. We're still monitoring, and it's looking good.
Thank you. [Pause.] After we complete this, do you want us to return to the PTC attitude? Is that correct?
That's affirmative, Frank.
Would you have someone get up the gimbal angles for us to point the X-axis at the Earth at the TV time, please?
Wilco. [Long pause.]
Also, Jerry, I'd like to know our range and velocity at that time.
Roger, Frank. You want the range and velocity at TV time.
Right.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. At 128 hours, your altitude is 97,413; your velocity is...
Stand by just a minute.
Okay.
At 128 hours, you say?
Roger. That's TV time. Your altitude is 97...
Okay.
Your altitude is 97,413; velocity is 6,072; roll is 1 degree, pitch is 58, yaw 0.
Thank you.
You're welcome. [Pause.]
I just got a newspaper, Frank. I'll go through it and pick out some news items for you.
Good. That'll be great. We're just eating breakfast.
How are you having your eggs this morning?
Bacon. All except Lovell. He's having eggs Benedict, he says.
It figures.
That Timber Cove crew, you know, they...
That's the gourmet crowd.
Silk-stocking set. [Pause.]
Jerry, in doing these P23s, we were just about over Africa most of the time. At least, it was in view; nice weather over there this time of year.
Roger. You want to go down there?
Do a little hunting.
Jerry, Jim Lovell just checked the P30, P21, and says you're right, 97,800 [nautical miles, 181,100 km].
Roger. Thank you, Jim. [Pause.]
We ought to have these computers flight qualified in another couple of missions.
Yeah. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. Was MCC-6 determined for exactly 122 hours, when you came up with that six-tenths of a foot per second? [Long pause.]
Roger. Jim, at exactly 122 we were figuring 0.5.
Roger. I'll try it again now at the same time using the P37 with MA. The last time we did it, before the last sightings, I got 2 feet per second. I'm going to see what I come up with this time.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We're ready for you to start your waste water dump anytime now. And could we have a crew status report?
You may! We had a good night sleep. Everyone slept at least 7 hours yesterday, and we're just finished breakfast, drunk a lot of water, and I think we're in very good shape; just used the exerciser.
Roger, Frank.
What would you like to know about?
That's about it. You ready for some morning news?
Yup!
Okay. There's really not a whole lot in the news this morning. Things are kind of quiet. I guess the biggest news is the accident rate - the holiday deaths - which is certainly not very pleasant news, but we had 233 people killed nationally, and 9 of them were in Houston on Christmas Eve and Christmas. In the world news, the families made the news again. This is Associated Press: "The families of Apollo 8 crew sent a Christmas message to Navy Commander Lloyd Bucher, Captain of the USS Pueblo crew, released this week by North Korea. The message, addressed to Commander and Mrs. Bucher, at San Diego Navy hospital read 'You have been in our thoughts and our prayers. Your reunion has brought great joy into our heart this Christmas day. Our best to you personally and to all the families under your command.'" And it was signed "Families of the crew of Apollo 8." Space officials said that the message had been suggested and written by Mrs. Frank Borman.
Thank you.
Let see. Elsewhere in the national news, the newlyweds, David and Julie Eisenhower, came away from their secret honeymoon hideaway to have Christmas dinner with President-elect Nixon and his family. In New York city, the world's busiest harbor was reduced to almost complete inactivity Christmas day, due to a 5-day old longshoreman strike and a rare hiatus in shipping schedules. No ships arrived or left the harbor. Ferries, running on reduced holiday schedule, provided the only marine activity. [Pause.]
Here's an interesting little feature item that's kind of good to hear. It seems that up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, they have a new youth gang. It's called the Gilnet Gang. It roams the streets of Ann Arbor, acting in secret, and sometimes bypassing the law. They call themselves the Guerrillas for Good. Some of the things they've done is, painted a bridge that was covered with obscenities. They painted it one night. A condemned house with - it's popular with neighborhood children, but dangerous, was boarded up. Downtown planters unfilled because of a debate over which group was responsible, business or government, were filled with flowers. A hedge, thought to be hampering vision, at busy intersection was trimmed, and the owner was angered. Trash along a portion of the Huron River was picked up. Members of the gang are anonymous teenagers who ask for no individual recognition. Their aim is to slice red tape, to get things - good things in their opinion - done. The organization has a faint religious overtone. It's sort of an ecumenical group, said an assistant professor at the University of Michigan who acts as an informal sounding board for the gang's ideas. The name is from St. Peter, the Fisherman's Net. And it's remote enough not to be identified with any particular church. There is a thread of Robin Hood running through this thing, said their teacher, who also prefers to remain anonymous. A lot of their activities are extra-legal. When the system bogs down, they directly administer good, rather than go through the red tape channels. The gang is made up of about 55 high-school kids, boys and girls, and there's another 40 or 50 who belonged to the gang before they graduated. The idea for the gang evolved from a trip to Detroit slum area, where a church group - youth group noted the way that street gangs operate. They were impressed with the methods of operation and decided to organize for a somewhat different reason. "It was the chance to do things for the pure sake of giving," said the gang's advisor. [Pause.]
That's about it as far as the world and national news and the features is concerned. On the sport page, Hank Stram of the Kansas City Chiefs was named as the AFL coach of the year. This is the second time for him in three seasons. The voting was done by an Associated Press panel of 30 sports writers and sportscasters, three from each city. And the nearest one to him was Weeb Ewbank. Other coaches that received votes were Sid Gilman of San Diego, and Lou Sabin of Denver. As for the Shriners College All Star game yesterday, the North cooled the South 3 to 0. Michigan State's Dick Berlinsky booted a 23-yard field goal in the first quarter and it was all the North needed to beat the South Wednesday, in the Shrine's College All Star football game. [Pause.] Let's see, I guess the interesting things about this are that first downs, North 19, South 16; rushing, North 214, South 169; passing was North 96, the South 109. So, all in all, it looks like they were evenly matched. Looks like Parseghian and his Notre Damers weren't as strong as ole Howard was worrying about.
Roger. We're dumping the water now, Jerry.
Okay, Frank.
For the big Astro Blue Bonnet game, the big basketball classic followed by the Blue Bonnet Bowl in the Dome: SMU and Oklahoma have arrived. They are getting ginned up for the big game. [Pause.] Doesn't say here, I don't believe, which are favored. I'll look that up and let you know later, if there is a favor here. The Davis Cup is underway now, down in Australia, and the US is bidding to recapture that again, and apparently we're favored to recapture the supremacy today. Another item in the news, is 0. J. Simpson; he was named player of the year in college football for the second consecutive season by the Walter Camp Football Foundation. Woody Hayes, as I told you yesterday, was named coach of the year.
Roger. [Pause.]
Well, I guess that is about it, Frank.
Thank you, Jerry. Appreciate that. [Pause.]
Jerry, this is Jim. We concur on that midcourse 6. Two tenths of a foot per second is what we get.
Real fine, Jim. [Pause.]
You want to just turn off your radios and come back without us?
No. We can't read out the amazing erasable memory if we'd have to go into Program 01 again.
[Laughter.]
I'd tried to get us back on the launch pad a little bit earlier.
Frank, one other little item in the news here, I thought might be interesting is - Stand by. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead. You're loud and clear.
Okay. I got interrupted there for a minute. Bob Hope's back out in Vietnam again with his troupe, doing a great job as usual. One little name in the news story here is from the USS New Jersey. Bob Hope joked from atop a huge gun turret yesterday - or Wednesday - to delight the 1,500 men aboard the battleship New Jersey on its 20th Christmas entertaining US troops abroad. Hope and his 27-member troupe entertained the New Jersey seamen after attending a Christmas mass aboard the carrier Hancock, both off Vietnam. "This must be the biggest Chris Craft in the world," Hope told the seamen. "It looks like Wake Island with a rudder." "I think it was nice of them to take the ship out of mothballs just to give me a 21-gun salute," he said. Hope joked while standing on one of the ship's 16 inch gun turrets. The sailors were particularly impressed by a squad of long-legged girls who came aboard with Hope including actress Ann-Margret and Miss World. [Pause.]
Did you say that was his 20th trip over there at Christmas time, or overseas at Christmas time?
That's right, it's the 20th time he has been over - overseas for Christmas with the troops.
He's as old as Jack Benny.
Roger. Hey, you can turn off the water dump now.
We're in the process, or as we say in the aerospace business: that's in work.
Roger. You do good work. [Long pause.]
That other aviator that's going around the world, Max Conrad with his light plane. He spent Christmas day in the Antarctic, at Puento Arenes in Chili; he's waiting for good weather so he can continue his flight down to the South Pole. He hopes to get around the world. He is going around both Poles, and he's going to fly from Palmer to Byrd, from Byrd to the South Pole, and then return home to the United States by way of New Zealand, Australia, and Hawaii.
Brother. He'd better take some No Doze with him.
I tried to talk Frank into the same trip. [Long pause.]
You can give him a weather report from Apollo 8. The South Pole was really clobbered - or at least it was the other day.
Roger. [Long pause.]
I don't imagine there's many alternates down there.
No, I don't think so.
We have some pretty clear weather up here.
No fog, huh?
Not outside. [Pause.]
Actually, it's snowing outside right now with that waste water dump that Bill just did.
Roger. Does it look a little bit like Christmas?
Right. [Long pause.]
Jerry, do you have a decision on what we're going to do about this next midcourse?
No, Frank. We don't need it.
Okay. I just wanted to make sure officially we'll scrub MCC-6?
Affirmative.
I guess - Jim says that was already official. I was sleeping at the time. I didn't hear it.
Okay. Frank, by the way, how do you feel about your EMS now? You feel like you've got all the answers to the little funnies you saw earlier?
Yeah. The answer is don't turn it into Auto, fast. It seems to be very sensitive to jerks, or separation.
Okay. You figure it's all pretty much just a switch throwing anomaly and if you - if you play it by the numbers and then slow and deliberate, you'll be okay?
Yeah. I'm getting - I'm getting razzed up here because I said it was sensitive to jerks.
[Laughter.] We thought of that, too, down here.
Yeah, I figured you did. I told Ken last night at separation after TLI, when we separated from the S-IVB, we got a nice bang out of the pyros and the EMS jumped over 100 feet per second.
Jerry, do you want to - I've got here in the Flight Plan to start charging battery B. Do you want that started at 100 now also?
Affirmative, Frank.
Okay. [Pause.]
Frank, we expect it'll take about 3 or 4 hours.
We're starting it.
Okay. [Long pause.]
And we're happy to report the Earth is getting larger.
Roger, that's comforting. Looks like you are going to make Earth instead of Venus, huh?
Right. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Your friendly guidance officer has got a LM vector update for you and a CMC time update. Over.
Okay. We'll go to P00. [Pause.] P00 and Accept.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. The updates are complete. The computer is yours. You can go to Block.
Block. [Long pause.]
Houston. We won't transfer that state vector, since we're not going to do this MCC. Is that all right?
Okay. Real fine, Frank.
Rog.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
We're proceeding with the chlorination.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Biomed switch to Center, please.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Mark.
Roger.
[Garble. May be 'Old joke' or 'Overkill'.]
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear.
Okay, thank you, we're starting P23.
Roger, Frank.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We have lost all CMC data on you. The last data we had showed a high middle gimbal angle. Over.
No. I'm fine. How come you lost those CMC data?
I think maybe it was just your movement - movement out of PTC.
I see, fine. Thank you, it was high. I was watching it though.
Okay. We have data now.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
We're noticing our quad A helium tank is starting to go up again. You got any ideas on that?
Yeah. We're watching it to, Frank. So far, it's still okay and we're talking about it.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Frank, this helium tank in quad A - it looks like we may have lathered you up unnecessarily on this thing. It appears to be no problem now, as best we can tell. We got a few of the minds together talking about it, and it's been down-rated quite a bit. Also there - the folks down here monitoring the P23 suspect that Jim is shooting on star number 22 rather than star 02, so he may be having some problems.
Oh no. We've changed; we're on star 02, on the Moon.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Frank, I may have to add some names to my chicken list.
About what?
Helium tank A, quad A.
Rog. I just don't want to be the one that proves the fracture mechanics people are right.
Roger, Frank. [Pause.]
This attitude is going to have us right square into the Sun, too.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're going to need some data from your last P23 marks. We missed some items, and so don't put it away and when you finish this next P23 we'll get it all together.
Okay.
Roger. Got some information for you on this PTC that we'll be going to, right after this next P23 exercise. We'd like you this time to try the nose north attitude, that's a pitch of 180, and a yaw of 315, and also we'd like to give another look at this mode free type of PTC and we think maybe we'll get a little bit of spin stabilization if we try it at 0.3 degrees per second on the roll rate rather than 0.1. So if you figure on doing that at 124:30 we'll see what kind of information we get out of it.
Okay. You know what I think of that, don't you? I'll be happy to do it, but I think it's playing games.
Roger. Frank, you're burning right now 1.4 pounds per hour with attitude hold in pitch and yaw. We're kind of interested to see if 0.3 degrees per second will reduce your RCS usage due to spin stabilization.
Yeah, I know. I predict that it will not.
Okay.
Jerry, I'm a little concerned about the temperature. We're getting kind of warm in here, and also the evaporator outlet temperature is up around 45 degrees. Do you have any trend that we're getting less efficient operation of the radiators now? [Pause.]
Frank, EECOM says everything looks nominal down here. You might try a change in your cabin temperature heat exchanger there.
No, we don't have the fans on, but what we have done is put up the window shades. That seems to help it. We've been getting a lot more sun in the cabin this way.
Roger. We'll keep a close eye on things and keep you posted.
Roger. I don't mind playing games because, you guys have been very nice in the five and a half days. If you want to play games in the next half hour, we'll play.
Roger, Frank. [Long pause.]
Jim is trying this set with the eye relief optics so we can give you some information on that.
Okay. [Long pause.]
I think it would be very difficult to extrapolate anything that you're getting out of this spin business to a LM-Command Module combination, because the spacecraft handles quite a bit different just with the change of fuel load, including the difference in drifting off in roll.
Roger, Frank. We just got finished discussing that, too. We agree with your point of view on that one. I think this is more of a curiosity thing than anything at all.
I think it's fine. No sweat. We don't have anything else to do here for about another 10 hours.
Okay. [Pause.]
Jerry, what I'm kind of curious about is the fuel usage. Now with P23 and what we were doing, we have a lot more fuel. [Long pause.]
Jim, we'll take a look at that fuel usage bit. Right now, the trend looks like it is getting better as we would expect with a lighter weight. [Pause.]
We'll try to get a little more definitive for you here.
Okay.
We really - we shouldn't complain about the fuel usage on that SPS engine though, because we're sure getting a lot of miles per gallon out of it. [Pause.]
Roger, Frank. [Pause.] Frank, we'll enter you in the Shell road test on that.
Yeah, but we don't have any TCP in it, or what is that, TCP? Yeah. That's the problem. If we'd had that, we would have probably used only half the fuel.
Oh, you mean Platformate?
That's right, Platformate. [Pause.]
If you will get the people to spread out one of those banners around the target area, we'll try to break it, you know, and coast through it.
Okay. We'll call some of the paper companies and see if they can find a roll big enough.
It won't take a big roll, just about 30 feet.
Rog. [Pause.]
Onboard nav. [Pause.]
You tell the doctors that we put William to sleep.
Roger. You won't leave any scars will you?
No. No, he's got his tape recorder with him. [Long pause.]
Bill said to call Valerie and have her to rewind the tape recorder - his tape recorder at home.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
I hate to tell you this, Frank, because Jim probably won't even be able to wear his comm carrier anymore, but that last set of marks put your state vector right on top of the MSFN state vector.
Come off that, Jerry. Come on; you promised.
I'll get you that bottle of brandy when I get home, Jerry.
Maybe we can get him to go to Program 01 again today, too.
Roger. That sounds good. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Also, on the Flight Plan for l24:30, we'd like for you to run an O2 purge on the fuel cells.
Okay.
Hey, Jerry. We were going over the checklist on entry here, you know?
Roger, Frank.
I've got a question. Is John Harpold around? [Pause.]
Roger. He's listening.
John, I can't remember. Is the lift vector up head-down or... [Pause.]
Jerry, I'm beginning to worry up here.
Roger. It depends on which way your nose is pointing.
Touché. [Pause.]
Right. You might note for the people at MIT that the next series of stars will be shot by the master navigator with a space helmet on and long eye relief eyepieces.
Roger. That ought to cut his speed down a little bit.
Right. [Long pause.]
Frank, while you're talking about the entry checklist, this cold-soak, have you decided exactly where you want to do it there prior to entry?
Well, I understood that EECOM talked that over with Bill, and we do it 1 hour prior to entry. We'll do it wherever you say is the best.
Okay. One hour is fine. It's just a matter of finding time in the timeline to do it.
I think we can initiate it 1 hour before Sep.
Okay. Fine. Sounds like a winner.
Really got all zeroes with that helmet on.
Roger. We just noticed that. [Long pause.]
Jim's going to leave the helmet off now for the rest of them. It gets a little anoxic in there. These helmets don't have face plates, and we have a difficult time breathing with that on.
Roger.
Okay. Jerry, that completes the P23. Did you have something else you want us to do now? You wanted to check on something from the last Sep.
Roger, Frank. We need to get some numbers that we weren't able to copy down here. Stand by just one. [Pause.] Frank, on your first P23, we missed three marks on star number 2. We missed mark number 3 runnion - trunnion.
Okay. Three trunnion is 05650.
Okay, 05650. Then star number 1, mark 2. We need the trunnion on that one, too.
04216.
And on star number 1, mark 3, the Delta-R and Delta-V.
Delta-R is 00006; Delta-V, 00001.
Roger. Four balls 6 and four balls 1. Okay. Frank, your PTC attitude is pitch 180, yaw 315, and roll rate 0.3 degrees per second. The reason for wanting to point it north is not because we are concerned at all about any changes due to venting; there's been, as far as we can tell, no effects on your trajectory by venting. They just want to try out that direction on it.
That's fine. We're going to stay in for about two more seconds while Jim takes the pictures through the sextant for the optics people.
Okay, Frank. And then, also, we're looking for a fuel cell O2 purge when you get a chance.
That's right. At - I got the word now; it's supposed to be at 124:30.
Right.
Okay. We'll do it.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. For your P37 that's coming up that you're going to run, use a midcourse 7 time of l44:46. Also just a little note here, the trajectory is looking so good, it looks like you could probably make the corridor without even making a midcourse 7.
Roger. 144:46 for the P37.
Affirmative.
Thank you.
Jerry, this is Jim.
Go ahead, Jim.
We're going to set this up for the normal PTC mode for a few minutes until Frank gets through with the - another step of the call.
Roger, Jim. When the time is auspicious, would you shift the Biomed switch over to left side?
I think we ought to shift it over right now.
Okay. No, they say hold it up for a little while.
So you can see the medical data... [pause] So you can see he has the same data that Dr. Berry got on me in Gemini VII is also good for Frank on Apollo 8.
Roger. He heard that.
Houston, Apollo 8...
Apollo 8, Houston.
Do you see that Program Alarm we got when we went through P37, 1302?
Affirmative.
I'll run through it again and see what happens here.
Roger. We're monitoring.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Looks like you loaded the wrong time there in P37. You should load 144:46 for your midcourse time; looks like you loaded 146:46.
Okay. I'm sorry. Yeah, I have it here. I wrote it down, 146:46. Okay.
Roger.
I guess the best way to terminate this is by going back to P00, is that right?
Affirmative.
Houston, Apollo 8. Looks like a plus 2.8 foot per second correction at midcourse 7.
Roger, Jim.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Started the fuel cell purge, and I'm going to 183:15, and I'll start that three-tenths of a degree per second roll stabilization test for you.
Roger, Frank. Thanks. [Long pause.]
Okay. There we are, and we are going to start rolling now.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Frank, on this free pitch and yaw, if either one of them gets outside of 15 degrees from the nominal values, we'll call it off.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. I would like to have the Biomed switch left now, if you can.
Roger, it's Left.
Houston, fuel cell purged to complete, O2. [Pause.]
Say again, Apollo 8.
O2 fuel cell purge complete.
Roger, thanks.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Looks like you've exceeded your 15 degrees offset PTC attitude, so you can go to attitude hold in pitch and yaw.
Okay. I'll go back to the attitude. We didn't even get around once, did we?
Doesn't look like it. So much for spin stabilization.
Well, we tried it last night several times at 0.15 to 0.2 degree per second. [Long pause.]
I think there's the phenomena known as inertial coupling that has something to do with that, huh?
Roger. That could be.
Put a bigger rudder on it.
Need some feathers, Frank.
Yeah. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. On the P37 comparison; using the MSFN vectors, we get a minus 1.4 on that midcourse, compared to your 2.8. We ran your solutions through our computer and we also get a 2.8, so your P37 looks good. We are busy still fiddling with the vectors and comparing them and we'll keep an eye on the difference.
Roger. Looks like we came up with a plus 2.8 though, and you say you came out with a minus one point something.
Affirmative.
Still quite a bit of difference, isn't it there? Isn't it? [Long pause.]
Jim, that 4 feet per second difference is worth 0.28 degrees on the flight path angle.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Frank. How is your cabin temperature looking now?
It's getting cooler, thank you. We put those shades up, and that really helps.
Okay. The primary loop down here still looks real good, so it looks like you are in fine shape. Your battery B charge ought to be done by about 127 hours, and we think you shouldn't even try to charge battery A, since it looks like, at Entry Interface, it's going to have 38 amp-hours on it.
I'll tell Bill that.
Okay.
How is the weather down there, Jerry?
It's loud and clear.
Cold?
No, it's pretty balmy around here today.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Yeah, the temperature's about in the 70's here. It's a real nice day.
Fine. [Long pause.]
Say, Jerry, last night, Ken was saying something about turning on VHF Simplex A about 20,000 miles [37,000 km] out. I agree. I wrote it down, but I can't seem - I can't remember where I put it. You still want to do?
Roger, Frank. We've got it in the checklist here as right around 4 minutes - 4 hours before EI, right after your nominal P23, P37 onboard comparisons, page E-1.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We're showing some garbage on your computer. If you'll hit Error Reset, we can clear that Program Alarm so the next one can be identified. Over.
We don't have any Program Alarm.
I think this - this is a carryover from your last Program Alarm there on that P37.
Okay. Error Reset. Thank you. [Long pause.]
That do it?
Stand by. Okay. Thank you, Frank. That did it.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Your battery is full; you can terminate charging. You've got 40 amp-hours on it now, and we've got a couple of requests for data here.
Roger.
...requests.
Okay. We were just talking about that. I tell Bill stop. Okay. What are your requests?
The first one is - the first time somebody is down in the equipment bay, we would like to get another reading on your RCS temperatures, those six temp meter readings, and the other one is of the boys in the back...
We just read them again.
Beg your pardon?
We just read the RCS qua - thruster temperatures again, and they're all pegged high.
Okay. Good deal, Frank. The other one is - the boys in the back room would like some time when everybody's awake - if you would fire up both cabin fans for about 5 minutes, they would like to see what the Delta-temperature is on the telemetry when you get the stagnation broken down and get some flow going over it. So if you can see your way clear to do that, we'd like to see it some time when everybody is up.
We had that running before in the flight. Did they check it then?
You mean early in the game, when you were cool?
Yep. When we were cool. Right.
Yeah. They got that data, and they were kind of interested in seeing what it looks like when the cabin is nice and warm and the temperature indicator is reading on the high side, to see how the Delta[-T] works in the other direction.
Okay. Coming on.
Okay. Thank you. [Long pause.]
What else, Jerry?
That's it, Frank.
Another thing, Frank, is we just want to remind you that there's no charge needed on A battery.
Hey, listen, these cabin fans - one of them sounds like it's got a bad bearing. We're going to turn it off. It's got a real squeal to it.
Okay, Frank.
Sounds like it's got something in it. [Pause.]
That must be Bill's teddy bear.
Say again.
That must be Bill's teddy bear.
I don't know, but there's something in there. [Long pause.]
We'll try them again, one at a time. See if we can determine which one's got the noise.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Number 2 is really bad. It's got a bad bearing, and it whines like mad, so we're not going to turn it on.
Roger. Thank you.
We are not going to try number 1 either; there may have - something might have got in both of them, Jerry.
Okay, Frank. That's fine. [Long pause.]
Sounds like that MG starter of yours. [Pause.]
I'm afraid to turn my starter on now. It's been so long.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We'd like to leave the PTC long enough to go orient toward the Earth for a TV shot to see if this TV thing is going off on 128. [Long pause.]
Roger, Frank. That is fine. Do you have the gimbal angles you need?
Yes, thank you. I got them earlier today.
Okay. [Long pause.]
I'd keep this kind of short because we're trying to get some sleep earlier [garble] earlier.
Say again, Frank. You're getting pretty garbled. [Pause.]
How's that antenna?
Loud and clear, Frank.
I said, will this be a short one? We're going to - we're trying to hurry things up a little bit to see if we can get as much sleep as possible.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Would you put the Biomed switch on the right side now, please?
Roger. [Long pause.]
Frank, do you intend to start your TV before 128? [Pause.]
Negative.
Roger.
That's what you wanted, isn't it? I thought - I thought that's when it was all squared away for.
Affirmative.
Apollo 8, Houston. Are you planning on using the wide angle lens?
I think that'd be best.
Okay. Jack says you want to be sure and use the red filter and the filter holder for that one. It takes a little darker filter.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Do you want to take both red filters on there or just the one for the filter holder? [Pause.]
He thinks just the red one on the filter holder will do, but might not hurt to have the other one ready, just in case. [Long pause.]
How about if we use the telephoto? It will be a little harder to focus, but it might end up a better picture. [Pause.]
Roger, Frank. If you want to use the telephoto lens, you ought to use the same combination you used going out, the 25A.
Okay.
Hey, Jerry.
Roger, Frank.
Ask your EECOM how many gallons of fuel we burned for TEI, will you?.
Roger. In work. [Long pause.] He's breaking out his sathometer now. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We will be handing over to Goldstone in 2 minutes. Over.
Roger, Jerry. [Long pause.]
Frank, the doctors say they're not getting anything on Bill yet. He's apparently not plugged up.
He is down underneath the couch getting some stuff out; he doesn't have his umbilical on.
Okay.
Tell them to look at the stuff they got yesterday. He hasn't changed at all. Just as mean as ever.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Hey, Frank, this simulation has really been great. What do you say after these photos we recycle back to TLI again?
That's fine. Bring on the backup crew.
Hey, Jerry, yesterday I tried to cycle back to the pad with 01 Program but it didn't work.
Jim, we missed that. Say it again when you get a better antenna.
Don't blame your antenna problems on us [garble].
Jerry, yesterday I tried to cycle [garble] 01 [garble].
Apollo 8, Houston. We are not reading you; stand by one.
Houston, do you read now?
Roger. Loud and clear. [Pause.]
I say, Bill will be ready in a minute; he is cycling back and forth under the couch trying to get the TV stuff out.
Okay. [Pause.]
Backup crew says they're ready to go.
Great. [Pause.] That was a fantastic voyage. [Pause.]
Sure was.
Now we're - now we're not through yet. We've still got 100,000 [nautical] miles [185,000 km] to go. You know, we kind of feel like it was all over with TEI, but we're still a long way. [Pause.]
Jerry, what I was saying before: I tried to hurry up the voyage home by - by calling up Program 01 to get us back on the pad, but it didn't work.
Well, that's the best excuse I've heard so far, Jim.
The best of many.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. On TEI, you burned 1,480 gallons.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Frank, you going to need Jim's slide rule for that calculation?
I got 162. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Rog. This is one of those rare occasions where Bill left his seat and I'm now sitting in it, and for the first time, I can see the Earth. I'm looking through his monocular; it's pretty nice.
Roger.
You had a little weather today it appears.
Last word from the weather guys here was that it was clear.
Well, we can see South America and Florida and through the lower part of the U.S. Looks like there is a weather front going over into the central part of the United States, lot of clouds over the northwest area. Florida is clear; it looks like the east coast is pretty clear.
Roger. They're clear but cold. [Pause.]
Lot of clouds up in Canada. [Pause.]
Maybe the geese'll go home. [Long pause.]
Jerry, we are going to turn it on and see how the picture is.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Nothing yet, Frank.
Takes a while to warm up, I think.
Any luck yet, Jerry.
Not yet, Frank. [Long pause.]
We got a picture now, Frank. It's twitching. [Long pause.]
The Earth is on now, Frank.
How's it look?
We are seeing about half of it. You moved in the wrong direction. Okay. It's coming back, a little more. Good, now a shade toward the terminator. [Pause.]
A little bit more toward the terminator and in the same direction you were moving it before. [Long pause.] Right; you have got it centered right in the middle. [Long pause.]
Now move it away from the terminator just a bit. [Pause.]
Good picture.
Okay. You want us to wait until 128, right?
Affirmative. Frank, move your camera to the right; I want to see which way the Earth moves on my screen.
Okay. Moving your camera to the right moves the Earth to the left on our screen. [Pause.] On our screen, the terminator is almost parallel to the horizontal direction, and the dark part is on the top.
Okay. We'll turn it back on at 128 then.
Okay, Frank. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Are you on a High Gain Antenna?
Roger.
Roger. [Pause.]
What beam width are you on, Apollo 8? [Pause.]
Narrow.
Roger. Narrow. [Long pause.]
This is Apollo 8. Do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear.
Roger. Radio check.
Roger. [Pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read now? Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear.
Roger. We're just trying something...
Apollo 8, Houston. You're in the scan limit right now on the High Gain Antenna; although you may have narrow beam width selected, you're in wide. To improve the situation would take a pitch down and a yaw left, and we'll have FAO check it and give you some angles if we need to change it.
We just got out of the scan limit by pitching up and yawing right. [Long pause.]
Roger. You're right, Frank.
Are we still in wide band, or are we in narrow band now?
We're checking.
Apollo 8, Houston. EECOM says you're in good shape now.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Comm check.
Loud and clear.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're getting television.
Roger. How's the picture?
Roger. The picture is on the lower right hand of our screen. [Pause.]
Camera should go down away from the terminator and to the right. [Long pause.]
Still down and about the same place; a little worse; now it's coming in.
Are you getting it now, Jerry?
Roger. We've got most of it; keep moving off to the right. Good. You have it centered right now.
Well, the Earth looks a little bigger to us today, not much, but it's somewhat bigger. I'm sitting over in the right hand seat now; Bill's got the TV camera; Frank's helping him out aiming it directly to hit the Earth. I hope we have a good picture. Can you see the clouds?
Affirmative. We sure can. Move it up toward the terminator - correction, away from the terminator just a shade.
At the tip of South America, there's a great swirl of clouds down there. It looks like a great storm. I wonder if you can see it.
Roger. We see a large swirl just to the south of the terminator.
Rog. And then up to the left hand side, or towards the north, we can see the light waters around the West Indies, and we can actually see Florida. I'm looking through Bill's monocular, and I can see the various land masses, South America and the central part and southern part of the United States.
Roger. Move a little bit away from the terminator now. [Pause.] Little left with the camera and a little further away from the terminator.
Say again, Jerry.
Okay. You're moving it toward the center of the screen now, and the Earth is off on the left side of our screen.
Real fine. That's good. [Pause.] Hold it right there.
What we're thinking about right now, Jerry, is hitting that wedge angle, about 2 degrees their limit. When we come back, the Earth looks pretty small right from here.
Roger. [Pause.]
You got it, Bill. [Pause.]
As I look down on the Earth here from so far out in space, I think I must have the feeling that the travelers in the old sailing ships used to have: going on a very long voyage away from home, and now we're headed back, and I have that feeling of being proud of the trip, but still - still happy to be going back home and back to our home port. And that's - that's what you're seeing right here.
Roger, Bill. We'll sure be glad to get you back, too. [Pause.]
This is Frank Borman. We've enjoyed the television shows, and we'd like you to stay tuned in, in the future, because there'll be flights and rendezvous in Earth orbit; and then, of course, there'll be television from the lunar surface itself in the not too far distant future. So, until then, I guess this is the Apollo 8 crew signing off, and we'll see you back on the good Earth very soon.
Roger, Frank. Adios.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
We'd like you to go back to PTC. Pick either attitude that's easiest to fly to.
Roger. In work.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Your PTC attitude ought to be either a 1045 or a 18315. We'd recommend 18315. That will keep your windows out of the Sun.
180, that's right. I got them mixed up, didn't I? It's 18315.
Roger.
Okay, Jerry [garble]. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. You're unreadable due to background noise. Over.
How now, Jerry?
Loud and clear.
I say we're starting to stow the spacecraft and get all squared away and then be sleeping and eating. We'll be all thinking about entry from now on.
Roger, Frank. And now that Bill's up, we'd like to get a redundant components check.
All right. He's putting helmets in the food boxes. Just a minute, I'll get him to do it for you.
Roger. There is no great hurry, Frank. We're...
What do you want it for?
We're mostly interested in looking at the secondary loop.
That's what I was going to say. I can't see any reason to check anything other than the secondary loop, can you?
That's affirmative. [Pause.]
Now in that cabin cold-soak, we won't have any cabin fans.
Roger. Understand.
Jerry, this is Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, go.
Roger. I just got on the sextant and now looking at Texas, and the weather man is right, it looks like a pretty good day. Full of clouds down there, but not bad.
Real fine, Jim. Can you see the kids out in the yard waving?
Would you tell Pete Conrad to get his kids off my roof?
Wilco. [Pause.]
Jim, do you see the bright spot out in the Pacific Ocean through the sextant?
I'll try. We saw it, of course, through the windows and through the monocular. I'll see if I can spot it.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Yes, Jerry, I can see the bright spot. It's - I guess it's the subsolar point. It's off of South America, it appears to me. It is a grayish spot compared to the blue waters surrounding it. It's undefined in diameter, though, I mean, it's not a clear round spot at all; it's just a raggedy one.
Roger. That showed up real well on the TV's picture. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We'd like to belay that request for a secondary loop check to a little better point as far as thrusting is concerned.
Fine. We can wait for a long time on that.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Jim, we've got some bird watchers in the viewing room.
Bird watchers, huh?
Roger.
Sounds good. Who are they?
Marilyn.
Oh, well, good. Say hello to her for me.
Yeah, and she's got a few troops with her, too. [Pause.]
Did she see the TV, I wonder?
Affirmative. Barbara and Jay are with her.
Good.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're replaying your television pictures now. We can see the Chilean coast and Florida.
Very good.
That's a pretty good little television camera, isn't it?
It sure is. With the right filters on it, it's great. That was a Schmitt input. [Pause.]
He must be a Jack of all trades.
Beautiful.
Houston, Apollo 8,
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Bill would like to ask the friendly Flight Surgeon's permission to take a Seconal so he can sleep.
Roger. Copy. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. That's a "yes."
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Before Bill falls asleep, we'd like to have him go ahead and do that secondary evap check now at any time at his convenience, and if we don't happen to be able to monitor it with high bit rate, just let us know when you did it.
Roger. I'll tell him that evaporator check at any time.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Biomed switch to the CDR. Over.
Roger. In work.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go. [Pause.]
Good afternoon, Jerry.
Howdy.
Okay. Somebody said something about checking out the evaporator, or evaporators. What do you want to do?
Roger. Before we get too far along, we'd like to see, essentially with the secondary evaporator check, that we've got a redundant components check.
Okay. Stand by.
Roger. EECOM says to be sure and let it go for at least 5 minutes.
Roger. Now you want to check out the primary evaporator also, or did you decide it's not necessary?
I guess they decided it's not necessary, Bill.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay. Secondary glycol loops coming on the line.
Roger, Bill. [Long pause.]
And the secondary evap's coming on the line.
Roger.
And it's stabilized the leg, oh, for about 5 minutes.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
All right. What do you have in mind here in the way of activating the secondary loop prior to separation? It looks like if we do have a cabin fan problem, we won't be able to do a full-blown cold-soak. Is there anything that we can do that'll do any good?
Well, right now, Bill, in the checklist, we're showing this activation at about minus 1 hour. Let me check with EECOM for a minute and see if they got any more words considering the cabin fan situation.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Looks like a good time. One hour before Sep - Entry Interface would be fine.
Okay. It won't do any good, then, seems to me, to fool around with these cabin temp valves. [Garble] primary and secondary [garble].
Bill, stand by. You're - got a lot of background noise. [Long pause.]
Go ahead now, Bill.
Read me now, Jerry?
Loud and clear.
Okay. This cold-soak is built around the premise that you've got a cabin heat exchanger, in my view; and if you haven't got a cabin heat exchanger, I'm wondering just what you can do. [Pause.]
He's thinking. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We think it'll still do a little bit of good so we'd just as soon go through with it.
Okay. Even bypassing the suit heat exchanger and that part of it too, huh?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Also, Bill, your secondary loop is looking good.
Okay. We just had 5 minutes. I'll deactivate it now.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Hey, Jerry. When do you want to crank up the VHF, anyway?
Roger. VHF Simplex - well, we had that on the checklist for about minus 4 hours.
Okay. We wanted - we wanted to put it out prior to max range, don't you think? Get an idea of when we're picking it up?
Roger. Stand by, Bill. They're talking about it.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Entry Interface minus 4 hours is just about right for the VHF. That's about - oh, around 142 GET
Roger. Thank you. [Pause.]
Next voice - next voice you hear will be that of the smiling Irishman [Mike Collins].
Outstanding.
