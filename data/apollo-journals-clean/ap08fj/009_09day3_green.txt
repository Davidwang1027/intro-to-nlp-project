Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Just wanted to let you know we still have voice contact, and we have the morning news for you. We can give it to you now or some time later. Your choice.
How about right now?
Very good. This is the 23rd of December edition of the Interstellar Times a la Paul Haney...
You're very clear, Mike.
Good. We had a big blizzard down here in the midwest; I don't know if you can see that from up there or not. And in Houston, as a matter of fact, it's getting pretty chilly, about 35 degrees [Fahrenheit, 2°C]. And we'd like to know who do you like next Sunday, Baltimore or Cleveland? Baltimore defense looked pretty tremendous yesterday. They put on a great pass rush, and it sounds to CapCom like Haney is trying to con you guys into a bet. Over.
I like Baltimore.
Are you giving points?
Negative. I don't bet.
I guess you don't if you don't give points.
Not with you anyway.
Okay. That's about the size of the news. Houston, standing by.
How are the families doing, Mike?
They are doing just great, Bill; just talking to Valerie a few minutes ago.
That was Frank.
Oh, well, likewise with Susan [Borman]. Haven't talked to her since last night.
Roger.
Mike, this is Frank again. You tell the doctors I got about 5 hours of good sleep last night?
Roger. Thank you, Frank; we were wondering about that. About 5 hours of good sleep.
Right. [Pause.]
How's everything going up there, Frank; y'all three of you guys feeling okay this morning?
Feel fine. Jim went back to sleep. Bill and I are having breakfast and everything seems fine.
Good; glad to hear it.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Rog. Just checking in with you after about a 45-minute quiet break. Say, we notice on your High Gain Antenna, if you like, you can get a little bit more use out of it by switching to it from an Omni when you have a yaw angle of 90 degrees, 9-0, and a pitch angle of minus 45 degrees. We're noticing that you're staying maybe an extra 10 minutes on the Omni, which is fine; but you could get more use out of the High Gain if you use that procedure. Over.
Okay, thank you. It's a lot simpler for us, as long as the Omni isn't working. We've got it all wrapped up here on the eight-ball with the roll [garble] pointing to an Omni number. We just switch it; it makes it a lot easier, if it is not bothering you.
Okay. That's fine. We're presently happy with the comm, Frank. We are just trying to be helpful.
Thank you very much. It's unusual that Mike Collins tries to be helpful, but nevertheless, thank you very much.
Good; aerospace first, Frank.
Say hello to Howard Tindall for us, will you? His procedures seem to be working.
Sure will. [Long pause.]
I hope you've got everybody looking this thing over very carefully. One thing we want is a perfect spacecraft before we consider the LOI burn.
Apollo 8, Houston. We concur, and we're doing that.
Okay. [Long pause.]
And Houston, Apollo 8. The water is in the process of being chlorinated at this time.
Roger. Understand you're chlorinating the water at this time.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
At your convenience, we'd like a readout of your Service Module RCS propellant quantities. We haven't gotten one of those so far this flight.
Alright. Stand by. We're just about to - need to change the antenna. I'll give them to you. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Go ahead, Apollo 8. [Pause.]
Okay. A, Service Module [quad] A. You ready?
Ready to copy.
The temperature is about 111 [degrees Fahrenheit], the helium pressure - Do you just want the quantity, or do you want the whole works?
Well, if you're reading, give us the whole works.
Okay. The helium pressure's about 37 [on quad A, that is 3,700 psi, 25.5 MPa], the [fuel] manifold [pressure] is about 182 [psi, 1,255 kPa] and the quantity is reading 80 [percent]. [Pause.] B has got the temperature about 112, the helium pressure about 36.5, the fuel pressure 180, and the quantity about 77. C has got the temperature of 140 - incidentally, those other temperatures should have been 120 instead of 110; I was looking at the wrong calibration here. The pressure is 37, the shield - the manifold shield pressure is about 182, and the quantity's 80. [Pause.] Temperature is - temperature, the package on D is 115, pressure is 37, the manifold pressure is 181, and the quantity is about 83.
Roger, Frank. I read you loud and clear. On the temperatures, quad A and B should both be 120. Roger.
Roger.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
I will trade all that good information for a readout of the actual quantities. If you give us a minute, we'll go ahead and chop - plot them up, Mike.
Roger. We'll stand by, we get them for you.
Apollo 8, Houston. I have your Service Module RCS quantities available. Over.
Roger. We're ready to copy at 50 hours, 16 minutes.
Okay. I have them both in percent and pounds; I'll give you both numbers. The pounds are slightly more accurate for plotting on your chart. Quad A, 72 percent, 219 pounds; quad B, 76 percent, 233 pounds; quad C, 70...
Take it a little slower, Mike; whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay.
Slow up. We just got quad A plotted. They're on separate charts.
Okay.
Okay for quad B.
Quad B; 76 percent, 233 pounds. [Pause.]
Okay. Quad C.
76 percent, 231 pounds. [Pause.]
Quad D.
76 percent, 229 pounds.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Would you give us the O2 and H2 as long as we're plotting?
Roger. Stand by for O2 and H2.
Apollo 8, Houston. We've got those numbers in percent. We're going to switch them over to pounds, and in the meantime, we're going to be changing our ground antenna in about another 2½ minutes. You can expect a comm glitch. Over.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. I have your oxygen and hydrogen quantities when you're ready to copy.
Ready.
Oxygen tank number 1, 270 pounds, 270; oxygen tank 2, 267, 267 pounds. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. Thank you.
Roger. On the hydrogen, hydrogen tank 1, 19.7; hydrogen tank 2, 20.1. Over.
Understand; 19.7 and 20.1.
Roger. A little bit low on the line on your graph due to the fact they started off low.
Roger.
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear. How me? Over.
Loud and clear. I was just checking on you.
Rog.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, Frank. Your 51-hour update of block data will be omitted. The block data you have on board is satisfactory. Over.
Understand. The block data we have aboard is satisfactory.
Right. That's for the flyby and the pericynthion plus 2-hour block update.
Okay. Number - window number 1 and number 5 are clouded, but they may be partially useful. The hatch window is very badly clouded. Window number 2 and 4 are good.
Okay. Understand the hatch window is unusable, 1 and 5 are partially usable, and the rendezvous windows are both good.
Right.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. We'd like to ask you about the next few hours in the Flight Plan. We're inclined to let Jim go ahead and sleep and to slip the P23 that occurs at 52:15. On the other hand, we'd think it would probably be a good idea if he returned more to the normal sleep rest cycle; and if you got him up nominally to do the 52:15 work, then perhaps he would be ready to go back to sleep at about 61 hours, when he nominally is expected to do so.
Okay. He's up now, eating. We're planning to go to normal procedures on the Flight Plan.
Okay. That - that's fine then. If - you know, there's no - it's not time critical that P23 be done at 52:15, but if you get up to do it then, that's just fine.
Well, we thought we might give it a try.
Roger. [Pause.]
This sleep cycle here is - we're just going to have to real-time it, I guess. I'm supposed to be asleep right now but, obviously - or I'm supposed to go to sleep here shortly, but I just got up. We're going to have to play this by ear.
Roger. Understand.
CapCom, Flight.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Are the stars in the Flight Plan proper for this next exercise of P23?
We would like to talk to Jim about it when he's ready to copy.
He's ready.
Okay.
Good morning, Mike. How you doing?
Fine, fine, Jim. You're sounding good this morning. We'd like to give you a little rundown on these stars. As you can see in the Flight Plan, we've got you scheduled for a number 33, Antares, number 34, Atria, and number 40, old Altair. Now, the first of those, Antares, is in plane; the second two are out of plane. As you know, we would like to get a mixture of the in and the out of plane. Antares, number 33, is close to the Sun, and we expect that you're going to have difficulty getting those measurements on number 33. We'd like very much for you to try, but if you're unable to do number 33, then we propose that you use number 42, which is Peacock, to the lunar far horizon. We realize Peacock isn't the greatest one available - greatest star in the sky - but it's about the only one available. Over.
Roger. Understand. I'll - we'll go to Antares first and try it. You know, we tried it last time, but I got one set before I lost the Moon completely in the white haze. I'll give it another try, and if it doesn't work out, we will go to Peacock and give it...
That, that's affirmative, Jim, and if neither Antares nor Peacock work, well then, we just will be happy to go with Atria and with Altair. We'd like then to increase the number of sets and do three on Atria, that's, number 34, and two on Altair, number 40; but that's only in the event that you can get neither Antares nor Peacock. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Did you copy?
Roger. This is 8. Copied. We'll increase the number 34 to three and the number set of 40 to two if we cannot get 33 or 42.
Yeah, that's exactly right.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. We're getting low bit rate from you now, rather than high, and on this P23 work, for us to get our data, you're going to have to delay the DSKY display about 10 seconds when it comes up with Noun - Noun 87. Over.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We're past that [Noun] 87 display now. Did you write down what your trunnion bias was? [Pause.]
Negative.
Houston, we haven't started [P]23 yet. Our Cal is zero.
Roger. Understand. Thank you.
We're in the process now to - to go to P23 attitude.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Rog. Our downlink data shows that on star 33, Jim's using the lunar far horizon when he should be using the lunar near horizon. Over.
Okay. Thank you. 220?
Roger. 220.
Let us check it.
Roger. [Long pause.]
You want the far horizon now, Houston?
Roger. Far horizon.
We have far horizon in now, Mike, on 220. I'll check again, though.
Yeah, the - that's right. We're requesting the lunar near horizon as per the Flight Plan, the lunar near horizon. We show that you are using the lunar far horizon.
Okay. Roger. I thought that you had copied up 220 to me. I'll put it in the near horizon.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead. [Pause.]
Mike, it's getting kind of damp - we're getting a playback, Mike. It's getting kind of damp in here. It might be a good idea to go back into Auto on the temp in - the glycol temp in for a while to try and get some of this moisture out of the cabin.
Roger. Stand by, Bill. [Pause.]
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
We concur. We'd like you to go back to Auto on the glycol temp inlet valve. Over.
Okay. And, what was our lowest radiator Out Temp during the last couple of hours while we have been in Manual?
I'll get it for you.
And we're back in Auto.
Roger. Back in Auto, and 29 degrees (F, minus 2° C) is as low as we've seen.
Okay. We're showing a cabin temp of about 76. It's very comfortable, but we're getting a lot of condensation on the walls now.
Rog. Understand.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston.
Roger, Mike. While we are waiting for the spacecraft to maneuver to the Moon, I might note that as we get closer to the Moon, the light from the Sun comes right into the scanning telescope, and it's impossible to use. You have to rely on the sextant alone. [Long pause.]
Roger, Jim. Understand that light from the Sun is coming into the scanning telescope making it impossible to use, and you have to rely on the sextant alone. Can you attach any angle to that? [Pause.]
Well, Mike, I'm right now at the substellar point of [star] 33 [Antares] and I don't know where the Sun is exactly from there, but that's about the angle. We're - the optics are pointed right at the Moon now.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're going to be changing our antennas in a couple of minutes. You can expect a comm switch-over.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Rog. The LMP is going to take a little snooze here for a while. I'm wondering, can you give me a quick - your view of the system status here before I depart, and also give me an idea of when the next cryo stir is due?
Roger, Bill. Will do; stand by. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Your systems remain unchanged. They're all looking good. You can go ahead and stir up the cryo starting right now.
Okay. Will do.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Before Jim makes his next mark [his last on Antares], could he call up Verb 1 Noun 1 [sic]? We missed the last trunnion. Over.
Roger. The last trunnion was 10660.
10660. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Before Bill gets his snooze, we'd like him to give us a PRD read-out on all three crewmembers. Over.
Rog. [Long pause.] CDR is 0.06, CMP is 0.64, and LMP is 0.64.
Roger. Thank you, Bill. [Pause.]
Looks like I'm the only one that's radioactive.
Understand. [Long pause.]
Okay. Houston, we got three sets [of marks] on 33 [the star Antaries]; we are going now to 34 [the star Atria] lunar far horizon for one set. Don't you agree?
We agree. Star 34, lunar far horizon, for one set.
Okay.
Houston, the cryos have been stirred, and could you also give me a quick rundown on how the SPS line temps are doing?
Roger, Bill. Understand you've stirred the cryos. Last time we checked, the SPS line temps were excellent; they were nice and warm. We'll give you another number right now.
And - and a PU valve. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. On your SPS system, your oxidizer is running 75 degrees (F, 24°C); fuel, 74 degrees (F, 23°C); and the PU valve between 78 and 82 (°F, 25.5°C and 28°C) depending on where we measure it. Over.
Real good. Everything really is working fine, Isn't it?
Yeah, it's really humming along, Bill.
Okay. See you later.
Adios.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston.
I understand you want two sets on [star] number 40 [Altair], lunar near horizon. Is that right?
That's affirmative. Two sets on number 40, lunar near horizon.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We missed your last trunnion angle, Frank.
21450.
Roger. 21450, and Paul tells me Valerie is over here and wishes Bill a happy nap.
Okay. Thank you. Tell her that he makes us tired sometimes too, will you? [Pause.]
Rog. I'll deliver a modified version of that message.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. On star number 40 that you're doing now, the Flight Plan only calls for one set of marks. You called down two sets, and it's really your choice. Only one is required. We're glad to have the data if you do a second set. Over.
We'll only do one then, if you want to. Our Flight Plan has been updated to include two sets. That is why I called it down.
Roger. One set is - will suffice.
Apollo 8, Houston. We missed the last trunnion [angle].
Very well, I will read it to you; 21455.
21455. Thank you. Just a matter of interest: it's taking your voice about 1.6 seconds to get down to us.
I'm a little hoarse, that's why. [Long pause.]
Okay. Houston, do you want us to go back to the PTC attitude now and start the rotisserie again?
That's affirmative, Frank. We'll have the PTC attitude for you in just a second here. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Those PTC attitudes remain pitch, 224 degrees; yaw, 020 degrees. On the next page, page 2-39 of your Flight Plan, those PTC numbers should be changed to reflect that.
Pitch 224 and yaw 20.
That's affirmative.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
When you've got a few minutes, we'd like to get a detailed crew status report from you.
Like what?
Well, like we'd like to know, in the last 24 hours, has anybody had any symptoms similar to Frank's. We'd also like to know - You know, we told you the other day to take Marezine if you like - we'd like to know if anybody had taken any drugs, and then we'd like to talk over there about sleep, rest and water and such.
Okay. Nobody's taken any other drugs; nobody took any Marezine; nobody's sick. Bill took one of those pills, sleep Seconal pills, last night. We - everybody had breakfast this morning and ate most of a meal - 1 day 3 - meal A day 3. What else do you want?
Well, we'd like to tell you to drink plenty of water. We think your water intake may be down. We copied your dosimeter readings. The only other thing is we just were wondering how you - in general how you feel. We show you'd had about 15 hours sleep total - Frank or Bill about 10 and Jim about the same, and we were wondering just how you're feeling in general.
We all feel fine; we're going to fix it now so that we all have one more rest period before the LOI.
Roger. Thank you. [Pause.]
Happiness is bacon squares for breakfast. [Pause.]
If you don't eat them all, bring them back. We'll polish them off here. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. Apollo 8 here. I stand corrected, William had one Marezine. He didn't tell me about it; he snuck it.
Roger. Understand Lovell sneaked the Marezine. Understand.
That's Bill Anders, though, he took one when he took the - with the Lomotil, when the doctors told him to.
Roger. We copy that. Thank you.
Okay. We're back in the barbecue attitude, starting PTC.
Roger, Apollo 8. Thank you. [Pause.]
Mike, we ran the latest state vector we have through the P21, and it showed the pericynthion at 69.7 miles.
Yeah, we're all having big talks about that down here. It looks like you're giving us a real good comparison on our system. Looking - looking extremely good.
We've got the navigator, par excellence, here.
I believe. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Rog. What was the time you used on that P21?
69:10 [GET] there, Mr. Slide Rule.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Mike, I wonder if Buzz wants us to change the time?
No, that's fine.
Oh, okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger. Are you going to give us an update for a maneuver PC plus 2 that does not assume a flyby maneuver?
Rog. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.
Rog. Here's a rather brief summary of the updates that you'll be getting. The one that you have now for PC plus 2 following an LOI minus 8 flyby maneuver is still good. That will not be updated. The next update you'll get will be MCC [Mid-Course Correction]-4. After that, you'll get two PC plus 2 maneuvers that assume MCC-4 completed. One will be a minimum Delta-V, and the other'll be a fast return. Do you copy?
Roger. Understand, and also I take it for MCC-4 you're going to give us a new alignment. Is that correct?
That's affirmative.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. I've got a lot of talking to do regarding TV cameras and brackets and what not. I'd like to start in on it whenever you are ready to talk about it.
Let me get a piece of paper out.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Go ahead.
Okay. First a question. Are you planning to show us TV pictures of the Earth today?
Well, that's what we wanted to do. It seems to us that's the most interesting thing that we can show you, but we - you know, we had trouble with the lens.
Okay. Well, that's good. All this procedure that I'm going to give to you here is relative to what we hope are fixes to the lens and for looking out your - your rendezvous window at the Earth, and all the gimbal angles and all that good stuff is based toward looking out the window at the Earth rather than at the Moon. Over.
Roger.
Okay. First, unstow the red filter, the polarizing filter, the red and blue filter holder, and some tape. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. Let me write this down.
Roger. I'd suggest that. I've got a whole page full. [Long pause.]
Okay.
Alrighty. Tape the red filter to the telephoto lens. That red filter is the 25A red filter, not the one that is in the red and blue filter slider.
Roger.
Attach telephoto lens to camera.
Hey, that - we can figure out how to do that. Roger.
Ensure that the automatic light control, the ALC switch on the camera, is in the In position. Over. [Pause.]
ALC In. Roger.
Rog. Attach camera to the adjustable TV bracket and attach the bracket to the TV mounting point on the Commander's side of the hatch to point out the rendezvous window number 2. [Pause.]
Roger.
Okay. And there's a note here that says, 'use dovetail on top of camera.' That's rather than the side dovetail. Use the dovetail on the top of camera for mounting to bracket and place the locking nut on the bracket down, and down means toward your minus-X direction. [Long pause.]
Roger.
Okay. They say this is - this step I just got through giving you is somewhat complicated. You might want to get the cameras set up early using the instructions I just gave you. When it's properly...
We are not reading you.
Roger. I say again, the instructions that I just gave you should end up having the camera looking out the window and about 30 degrees yawed left from your plus X-axis, so I suggest you get the camera set up that way early; and if there are any problems, come back to us; we will talk them over. These mounting instructions are sort of complicated.
Roger.
Okay. The next step: dim the interior lights. Over. [Pause.]
Dim interior lights.
Roger. Next, stop Passive Thermal Control at gimbal angles pitch 224, yaw 020, roll 270. Over.
Pitch 224, yaw 020, roll 270.
Roger. Next, acquire on High Gain Antenna, switch to Auto Track, Narrow Beam upon acquisition. Over.
Got it.
Okay. Yaw spacecraft left to get good view of Earth in your rendezvous window number 2. And you may have to pitch slightly as well, but primarily a left yawing maneuver to get a good view of the Earth.
Got it.
Okay. This maneuver is going to put you very close to your scan limit for the High Gain Antenna, so while you're making the maneuver, you know, check your lights. If your scan limit light comes on, you still have got 15 degrees to play with. But the only message is, should you break lock, then you are going to have to go back and reacquire and do that maneuver over again, because you're going to be very close to the edge of your High Gain Antenna capability.
Thank you.
Okay. And then finally, now that you've got the spacecraft over there, aim the camera as required to include the Earth in the field of view, and do not touch the body of the lens while televising. Apparently, if you put your hands on the lens itself, it causes electrical interference. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. Aim camera and do not touch lens while televising.
Right. And in all this stuff, in all these pictures using the ALC, it's important that you let the camera stabilize for at least 10 or 20 seconds, to let the ALC do its thing. [Long pause.]
Stabilize for 10 to 20 seconds. Thank you.
Right, now. We have some additional instructions in case this does not work. They say a full 20, Frank, on that ALC. It requires a full 20 seconds undisturbed for the ALC to properly do its thing. Now if these procedures that I've given you do not work, then we'll be giving you some more, and they have to do with other filters and various combinations thereof. So I'd have the polarizing filter and the red and blue filter holder at hand because we'll be attempting to use those in addition to the red filter if - if this procedure doesn't work.
All very well, Mike.
That's all we have right now. We'll have a few more remarks on the TV coming up to you later. But I'd suggest that you get set up for this early, and if you have any questions on it, shoot them down to us. We have a bunch of experts down here eager to help out.
Thank you; will do.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Just a voice check, Frank.
Roger. You're loud and clear.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Rog. We would like some high bit rate data when you can get us locked up on the High Gain. We haven't had any of that for a while.
Roger. We'll do that.
Thank you. How's that camera bracket thing working out?
We are doing it right now. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is Apollo 8 transmitting to you on the High Gain. How do you read?
Read you loud and clear, Frank. Thank you. [Pause.]
Apollo 8 transmitting on the High Gain Antenna.
Apollo 8, Houston. You're loud and clear. Thank you for the High Gain.
Roger.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. Are you getting the high bit rate all right? [Pause.]
That's affirmative, Apollo 8. We are getting good high bit rate.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Rog. I've got some more talking to do about the TV any time it's convenient for you.
Go ahead.
Okay. First thing, we've made no provisions in these instructions for taking pictures of the Moon. If you could get some Moon shots after it's all over by looking out a different window or by making some small maneuver, of course, we'd be happy to have them, but the show as scheduled is just out the window at the Earth only. Over.
Roger.
The second point is, of course, when you stop your Passive Thermal Control, you're about 90 degrees to the Earth line, so when you make that yaw left, you're going to have to yaw left until your middle gimbal angle is in the vicinity of 60 degrees. You'll get the additional 30 degrees by the offset between where the camera is pointed and your plus-X axis. But the two together are going to total up around 90. We just wanted to make sure that you understood you were going to be working with a large middle gimbal angle. Over.
Roger. We understand that. We also are looking at the Earth right now, and there is a spectacular long thin band of clouds. Looks like it may be a jet stream. It's absolutely spectacular - going almost all the way - or halfway around Earth.
Roger. Well, you might want to repeat that during the - during the TV narrative, and we also would like you, if possible, to go into as much of a detailed description as you poets can on the various colors and sizes of those things and how the Earth appears to you, in as much detail as you possibly can muster. Over.
Roger. I figure we'll have to do that because I'll bet you - I won't bet, but I bet the TV doesn't work.
Well, we won't take that bet, but anyway, we are standing by for a nice, lurid description, and we would suggest that you talk a little bit slower than you did yesterday. Over.
Okay.
And the only other thing on this TV is that the experts tell us that, do not point - with the wide angle lens on the camera, do not point at either the Earth or the Moon. It comes close to damaging the interior of the instrument due to the fact that it's too bright. Over.
Understand.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. We're going to have to switch to an Omni.
Roger, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Just checking the voice comm, Frank.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Rog. We'll be switching antennas from Madrid to Goldstone in another 3 minutes. You can expect a glitch on your comm.
Thank you.
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're reading you loud and clear through Goldstone. Over.
Okay. We have the television On now, and we're trying to maneuver to the - to the Earth.
Roger. Understand.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger. We're maneuvering to position now for the TV. Bill's got it set up in Frank's left rendezvous window, and I'm over in Bill's spot looking out the right rendezvous window, and the Earth is now passing through my window. It's about as big as the end of my thumb.
About as big as the end of your thumb at arm's length, huh?
That's right. And I think what we see now is South America down below us.
Roger. Is the TV camera pointed about 30 degrees yaw left from the plus-X axis?
Stand by a moment. We're checking it. We think we've got it in the right position. We're going into position now.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Houston, are you getting any sort of a picture? [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Negative; not yet. [Long pause.]
Okay. Houston, Apollo 8. We should have...
Hello, Houston; this is Apollo 8. We have the television camera pointed directly at the Earth now and have followed the instructions you gave us.
Roger, Frank. We're picking something up on our TV. It's not very good so far, but let it sit for a second, and we'll have more instructions for you. [Pause.]
Okay. It[Earth]'s coming into view now, Frank.
It is?
Yes. We have it in the corner of our screen. You're slightly off on your pointing, but we're getting a darn good look at the corner of it. [Pause.]
It's moving off, Frank. It's moving off our - 3 o'clock on our TV screen. I have no idea what to tell you about which way to point. [Pause.]
It's moving further away. We've lost it now. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Receiving nothing now. Over.
Okay.
We're - we're - we're receiving the picture; we're just not seeing the view of the Earth.
Roger. I got you.
Okay. We're just picking it up at 3 o'clock on our screen.
Okay.
It's moving up toward 1 o'clock and in toward the center; keep it going in that direction.
Okay.
It's looking better. You're holding it about 1 to 2 o'clock. Looking better.
And it's disappeared off to our 3 o'clock. There, it's coming back in now. It's headed toward the center of our screen.
Mark.
It's right in the center of our screen. And just hold her - hold her steady. It's really looking good. Okay. We have...
What you're seeing, Mike, is a - Houston, what you're seeing is the Western Hemisphere. Looking at the top [left in this image] is the North Pole; in the center - just lower to the center is South America, all the way down to Cape Horn. I can see Baja California and the southwestern part of the United States. There's a big, long cloud bank going northeast, covers a lot of the Gulf of Mexico, going up to the eastern part of the United States, and it appears now that the east coast is cloudy. I can see clouds over parts of Mexico; the parts of Central America are clear. And we can also see the white, bright spot of the subsolar point on the light side of the Earth.
Roger. Could you give us some ideas about the colors, and also, could you try a slight maneuver? It's disappearing. We're seeing about half of it. It's going off to our 12 o'clock. Now it's going off to our 3 o'clock. That is the wrong direction. Ya, that's a good direction. [Pause.]
We need another small correction to bring it to our center screen. If you could maneuver toward the terminator; we're - that's the part of it we're missing. We're getting the lighted portion. There you go; that's fine. Stop it right there.
Okay. For colors, the waters are all a sort of a royal blue. Clouds, of course, are bright white; the reflection off the Earth is - appears much greater than the Moon. The land areas are generally a brownish - sort of dark brownish to light brown in texture. Many of the vortices of clouds can be seen of various weather cells, and a long band of - it appears cirrus clouds that extend from the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico going straight out across the Atlantic. The terminator, of course, cuts through the Atlantic Ocean right now, going from north to south. Southern hemisphere is almost completely clouded over, and up near the North Pole there's quite a few clouds. South - southwestern Texas and southwestern United States is clear. I'd say there's some clouds up in the northwest and over in the northeast portion.
Roger. Could you maneuver toward the terminator again, please? [Pause.]
A little bit more. Stop right there and hold it. [Pause.] It keeps slipping up a little bit; could you maneuver slightly more toward the terminator? [Long pause.]
How's that, Houston?
We're getting about half of the Earth, Frank. The top half of it - our top half which includes the dark portion, is obscured. [Pause.]
How's the definition on the picture?
Looks pretty good.
Can you see cloud patterns at all?
That's affirmative.
Good.
Are you still seeing it, Houston?
Yeah, we're seeing it. We're missing the portion of the Earth that's over toward the terminator. The dark portion of the Earth is - we're not picking up. We're getting about three-quarters or four-fifths of the rest of it.
Roger. I'll move it, and tell me when I'm getting better or worse please.
Good. [Pause.]
Stop right there. That's - that's worse, Bill. Go - go back where you were. You made it disappear to our 3 o'clock. Now it's coming back. [Pause.] Okay. Stop right there. Now you're back where you were, and we need a motion that's about 90 degrees to that last one you gave us. [Pause.]
That's the wrong 90 degrees. 180 degrees away from that one. [Pause.]
Stop right there. [Pause.] Okay. Now we've lost a different half of it. I need a motion 90 degrees to that last one. [Long pause.]
That - that's good right there, Bill. That's good right there. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. If you can stick your polarizing filter in front of the camera without disturbing anything else, it might improve the quality slightly. [Pause.]
Stand by.
Roger, Bill. [Pause.]
Okay. The polarizing filter's in front. [Pause.]
How's it now, Mike?
It's still looking good. That didn't make much of a change one way or the other, but in general, considering how far away, it's looking excellent. [Long pause.]
Well, I hope that everyone enjoyed the picture that we're taking of themselves. How far away from Earth now, Jim, about?
We have you about 180,000 [nautical miles].
You're looking at yourselves - [Garble] Jim. You're looking at yourselves as seen from 180,000 miles out in space. [Pause.]
Mike, what I keep imagining is, if I'm a - some lonely traveler from another planet, what I think about the Earth from this altitude, whether I think it'd be inhabited or not.
Don't see anybody waving; is that what you are saying?
Well, I was just kind of curious whether I would land on the blue or the brown part of the Earth.
You better hope that we land on the blue part.
So do we, babe.
Jim is always for land landings.
Roger. This picture is drifting off center again. If you could make another correction to bring it back. I couldn't tell you which direction, but that - you're going the right way, you're going the right way. A little bit more; a little bit more. Ah, whoa, stop right there. That - that's the best centering we've had, Apollo 8. If you could just hold that, that's perfect.
To give you some idea, Mike, of what we can see: We can - I can pick out the southwest coastline of the Gulf and where Houston should be, and also the mouth of the Mississippi; I can see Baja California and that particular area. I'm using a monocular which we have aboard.
Rog. Understand.
This is an 8-power instrument I have.
Right. Well, we are seeing the entire Earth now including the terminator. Course we can't see anything past the terminator at all. Are you able with your binoculars to see the dark horizon? Anything past the terminator?
Negative. Mike. We can't see anything past the terminator with the binoculars or without them. This Earth is just too bright, and it cuts down the night adaptation to see anything on the dark side.
Rog. Understand.
Since this is winter - since this is winter time in the northern hemisphere, we can see all of the South Pole and the southern ice cap, and not too much of the North Pole.
Hey, you and Jim better get together. Jim just said he saw the North Pole.
He is looking out a different window.
That's what makes it different.
Do you still have the...
[Garble] the monocular upside down.
Do you still have the polarizing filter in front of the camera?
Negative.
Okay.
Try putting it back in front of the camera one more time.
[Garble.] Okay? [Pause.]
And once again, we need a small attitude correction. Our Earth is disappearing up and to the right. Our Earth and your Earth. The wrong way, wrong way. [Pause.] A little bit more. [Pause.] Okay. That's fine if you can hold it right there. Oops! No, it's slipping back off again. [Pause.] Okay. Keep coming a little bit more, a little bit more. Okay. Ninety degrees to that direction; that's the wrong 90, the other way. There we go. A little bit more. Nope, no, wrong way, wrong way; I'm sorry. Keep coming in that direction. [Pause.] No, it is gone up at our 12 o'clock, to that last - There we go, it is coming back down, it's coming back down. Bring it down more. Okay. Stop. Now we need 90 degrees to that direction again.
I hope that the next camera has a sight on it.
Rog. [Long pause.]
How's that?
Well, that has disappeared, just practically. We're wondering if there was any chance of your looking out one of the other windows and seeing the Moon? Hey, it's coming back in now, Bill. Okay. Hold it right there. That - that - that's fine for the Earth right where you are. That - that's extremely good on the Earth if you can just hold that.
I don't think we have - It has the polarizing filter in front of it now, Mike.
Roger. Thank you, and it's centered very well. We get a very slight improvement with this, but in general, it is very good considering the distance.
How about the Moon, Frank? Is it visible through one of your other windows? Could you get it visible with a small maneuver?
Negative. I think we have to save the Moon for another time.
Roger. Understand. [Long pause.]
It's still very well centered with your picture. We noticed a couple of jumps in the apparent intensity. Did you make some filter changes?
Roger. We tried to put that other red filter in front of it, but it didn't seem to fit.
Roger. [Pause.]
We'd - On a final test when you get down to the end of your allotted time here, we'd like you to remove all filters and let us see how it looks with all filters removed, and then we would like to get several spotmeter readings at the very end after the test. [Pause.]
Okay. We will be removing the red filter now.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Do you still have us, Mike? The lens [means filter] is off now.
Roger. We have it, and if you could maneuver toward the terminator slightly, we - you would again center our picture. [Long pause.]
Okay. Stand by. [Pause.] How's that? Is that the right direction?
That's the right direction. Keep coming. [Long pause.] Now that's the wrong direction, Frank. Did you...
How is it now, Houston?
Well, negative. I need another maneuver toward the terminator. [Pause.] It's drifting off the screen to our 11 o'clock. We appear to need a maneuver toward the terminator, Frank.
Thank you. [Pause.]
No, that is apparently the wrong way, Frank. We're starting to lose the picture. There you go. That - that's the correct way. [Pause.]
Okay, Houston. How's that for today?
That's just fine, Frank. That's great. We would like to, at the conclusion here, take three spotmeter readings. You can do that at any time at your convenience. We'd just like to get some after-the-fact readings on the Earth's intensity.
Roger. Jim has got the spotmeter on now.
Thank you.
Is it centered now, Houston?
Not quite, Frank. [Pause.]
That's good right there. Hold that right there. That's good. That's perfect. [Pause.]
Okay, Earth. This is Apollo 8 signing off for today.
Good show, Apollo 8. We appreciate it. See you mañana.
Roger. [Long pause.]
We got Haney down here following your trajectory, so all's well. He says you're 10 minutes from the Moon's sphere of influence.
Okay. Good.
Houston, Apollo 8's returning to the PTC mode.
Apollo 8, Houston. Understand; returning to PTC. Thank you.
Roger. [Long pause.]
You can tell Jim he's getting pretty ham-handed with that P21; he got a perilune altitude three-tenths of a mile off what we're predicting down here.
Is that right?
Rog. Apparently, he got 69.7 [nautical miles], and the RTCC [Real Time Computer Complex] says 70.
Are we going to leave it at that, or we going to correct it to make it lower?
We're - we're talking about it, Frank. [Long pause.]
We got a lumen riding - reading [of the Earth] of about between 1 and 1.25 thousand - 1.25 K.
Rog. Understand; between 1 and 1.25 K. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger. If you put your CM TLM to Accept, we'll send you our state vector.
Touché.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
How does everything look, Mike, all our systems and everything? See any switches out of place?
Negative. I'll take a check around here, but it is looking good. Just a second.
We're all over the cabin, and like monkeys, and I wanted to make sure we didn't hit anything. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Everything's looking good down here. All switches and systems are Go.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. How are you reading on Omni D?
We're reading you loud and clear, Frank.
Okay. We're reading you loud and clear also. Thank you.
We're having a playback of your TV show. Still enjoying it down here. [Pause.] It was better than yesterday because it didn't preempt the football game.
Thank you. Don't tell me they cut off a football game; didn't they learn from Heidi?
Well, you and Heidi are running neck and neck in the telephone call department.
