Okay, let's do the - on this DSE again.
Now, I think we - I told you earlier what I thought I'd do and I discovered that I ended up with the high-speed film, in one of the cameras - I believe it was the second rev. And it's my feeling that the - target 12 was accomplished. And I believe that targets 10, 14, 16, and 19, and possibly 20 and 21 were taken with high-speed film. What is important is you should know between which craters I changed to the other camera. I believe that and possibly Taruntius were taken with the proper film. Also probably 31 and 40. Terminator photography was taken at the end of the first rev, properly configured, as indicated previously,.
One was at 26.
Okay, terminator photography was accomplished at the morning far-side terminator, and I believe we had the high-speed camera. We used the 16-millimeter camera with the proper f-stop. It's been rather difficult to - to keep on rev 2.

Roger. Reading you loud and clear, and ready for the burn status report.
Roger. Ready to copy.
Houston. Roger. The burn was on time, 11 seconds, 0.2 with a VGX., 1.8; VGY - that's minus 1.8; minus 0.2, VGZ; Delta VC was minus 9.4. Verb 82 gives us an apogee of 62 and a perigee of 60.8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Roger. Your burn was on time, 11 seconds; VGX was plus 0.2, VGY was minus 1.8, VGZ minus 0.2, Delta-VC minus 9.4, apogee 62, perigee, 60.8. Over.

Houston, how do you read? This is Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Weak but clear.
You're loud and clear.
Houston, Apollo 8. We're on High Gain now if you want to get the high-speed data to look at that burn.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Roger.
Okay, I think I've made a mistake, on the last DSE I've gotten confused here.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We are taking the DSE.
Thank you. Can you hold it for about 5 seconds - or about one minute?
Roger. Holding.
Okay.
Wait just a second; 58 is not around - starting on frame 61.
Okay. You can dump the data now.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. We're taking the DSE for dump.
Did you get it?
We've updated the LM state vector with a Verb 66, Houston.

Hello, Michael.
Hey, good morning, Frank. We've been tracking you for about 18 minutes now, and we show your orbit 61 by 60½. Over.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Your SPS engine looked good on LOI number 2 burn.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Bill has got the tape recorder now; we're evaluating the dump. The data is good, and we're evaluating the voice quality here shortly.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
I've got a few jolly updates for you when you're ready to copy.
Stand by.
Go ahead, Houston, with your updates.
Roger. Apollo 8, Houston. I have a TEI-3, TEI-4 and map update for revs 3 and 4 to read to you. Actually, the TEI-3 update which you have onboard is still valid, so we will not update that one. Which do you want first, the TEI-4 or the map update?
TEI-4.
All right. This is the TEI-4 update: SPS/G&N; 45695; minus 0.53, plus 1.41. Are you with me so far? Over.
So far.
Very good. 077:21:27.58; plus 3062.7, minus 0062.5, plus 0057.7; 180, 018, 001; not applicable, plus 0018.8; 3063.9, 2:56, 3045.2. Are you with me so far? Over.

That's affirmative, Frank.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. When Bill gets a minute, we'd like to get battery B started charging. Over.
Roger. Thank you. He'll take a minute right now.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go.
Roger. For Bill - the voice quality on the backside DSE is extremely poor. We consider it unusable, and we recommend that all pertinent comments be hand recorded so we don't lose them. We should not count on using the tape at low bit rate for voice.
Okay, Houston. We're getting so busy that we are having a hard time trying to do a neat job of logging. I'll try to do it on the Flight Plan; and if I make any visual observations, we'll put them on the DSE and I'll try to scribble some notes here and there.
Roger. Understand. Now high bit-rate is working great.
Roger.
Hey, Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
How about giving us the TV times for the ninth rev, will you please?
Oh, we sure will, Frank. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We're checking into precise start and stop time for the TV, and you are Go for the next rev. Over.
Understand; Go for the next rev. Mike, we'd like to, if we could, time the TV to a passing over the terminator. We would like to track the terminator with the TV; think that's the most impressive thing we've seen, and that might be the best thing rather than trying to acquire the Earth.
Okay, Frank. That's one of the things we're looking at. Right now, we have you ending at about 86 hours and we're looking at extending that few minutes to include that terminator view. Over.
Okay, I don't want us to run into rev 10 very much at all, though.
Roger. Understand.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
since the DSE qual's not so good. How do you read, Mike?
I read you loud and clear. You were cut out about the DSE. Say again.
Roger. Since the qual is...n't so good, let me give you a quick rundown of the status of photo targets. You ready to copy?
Ready to copy.
Okay. At rev 1, we got photo target 90 and terminator photography south for near-side terminator. Starting on rev 2, we've got target 12 and target 10, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21 and 23. Unfortunately, we got into a high - I got into the high-speed film there somewhere, and I think those 250-mm targets were on high speed. We did change film, and starting out in Tex - Crater Texas, with target 28, 31, 40, 36, plus several targets of opportunity that were recorded on the DSE, but apparently lost. Have you been able to copy?
Yeah, I'm with you, Bill. Keep going.
Okay. I might be calling up too fast. Okay. On the third rev, we got target 58 and 63 and 65. The training photography was accomplished, and it was done on magazine D, which now has correction, that's magazine E which now shows 95 exposures. Magazine D is fresh. Magazine K was also used for training photography, and it's showing 0.51.
Rog, we copy all that, Bill.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Mike, this is Frank again.
Go ahead, Frank.
Go ahead.
Rog for Bill.
around.
Apollo 8, Houston standing by.
I say is Rod Rose around?
Stand by one, Frank; we'll look for him, and while we're doing that, for Bill the DSE voice quality on high bit rate is very good, so if he wants to use the DSE in high bit rate for a limited amount of time to record important things, we suggest that he do that. We'd like him to wait 20 seconds after turning it on prior to talking. Over.
Roger. Copy.
Thank you, Bill.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Rod Rose is sitting up in the viewing room; he can hear what you say.
I wonder if he is ready for experiment P-1?
He says thumbs up on P-1.
Houston, with reference to the DSE on high bit rate, what I'd like to do then is, if you got the last pass, I'd like to play it - run it back and start at AOS on low bit rate and then go to high when we need it. How would that be?
John Aaron buys it.
Okay, Mike. This is Frank again.
Go.
Roger. Rod and I got together, and I was going to record a little - saying a little prayer for the church service tonight. And I wonder - I guess that's what we are ready on?
Stand by one, Frank.
All right.
Houston, Apollo 8. Are you still there?
You're still loud and clear, Frank.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead, Frank, with your message.
Okay. This is to Rod Rose and the people at St. Christopher's, actually to people everywhere. Give us, O God, the vision which can see thy love in the world in spite of human failure. Give us the faith to trust the goodness in spite of our ignorance and weakness. Give us the knowledge that we may continue to pray with understanding hearts, and show us what each one of us can do to set forth the coming of the day of universal peace. Amen.
Amen.
I was supposed to lay-read tonight, and I couldn't quite make it.
Rog. I think they understand.
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. Frank, we'd like to know about the water chlorination. Have you - when was the last time you chlorinated the water? Over.
About an hour and a half ago; we've already done it.
Roger. We copy an hour and a half ago. Affirmative?
Roger. You know we wouldn't forget that.
Roger.
Jim spilled a little, and it smelled like a bucket of Clorox about an hour ago.
Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
I said Jim inadvertently spilled some of that chlorine, and it smelled like a bucket of Clorox in here a little while.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. We have two and a half minutes to LOS, and all systems are looking good. Everything's looking just fine down here, Frank.
Thank you.
We'll have some more information on the TV on the next rev. We don't - we're not planning any big change in the time, just to extend them a little bit, I think, closer to the terminator.
Just give us the time, will you, because we just want to know when it is. I'd like to get the terminator if we could, and we've got a little message, and that's it.
Roger. We'll do that the next time you come around.
Thank you. Okay. And have the EECOM guys keep a sharp watch on our systems. Old Anders is so busy fooling around with these pictures that - not much else is getting done.
Rog. The EECOM is doing that.
Man, that's a charm.
Magazine E, showing 95 exposures, will be used for far-side terminator south photography for rev 4 and target 10 and 20 series which we believe were shot by the high-speed film on rev 1. We're using magazine I and magazine D to do the vertical stereo. Both of those show zero.
Okay. Frame number 104 was taken into von Braun...
which showed an interesting little ridge down the middle of it in one of the turtleback stills in one - in the little side crat - in the crater to the east.
The next exposure was taken at 75:23:06.
Target 19.
Exposure 116.
That was taken at 1/60th of a second at 5.6 with the terminator. We'll do it at 250th - that's good enough.
Spotmeter readings vertically are recorded on the map for lumens...
And they're all reading between 160 and 320.
Oblique: about 4 in the - between 460 and 320.
What time have you got, Frank?
Okay, going for target number 14, magazine E, frame 116.
116 will be a target-of-opportunity photo showing some mountains on the horizon.
Camera number - vertical stereo camera was put to 5.6 from 2.8 at 75:27.
Huh?
What time have you got, Frank?
75:28.
Okay...
What's the time?
12:23.
Starting at 12:23 on the event timer, we're going across what I think is - is Washington, though it's very hard to tell.
Target 19 was taken with mag E, about frame 107; series of three.
Make it a series of four.
Okay, we finished - target 19; four exposures on frame 111.
What's your time, Frank?
14:05.
We should have put this over in your window. How about - Can you take this in your window?
Now, you want it while it's running?
Yeah, go ahead. It's getting in the way of this other one.
I'll count out the exposures for you.
Yes.
Call out your time, Frank, please?
15 minutes.
14?
15.
Okay, target number 23; 15 minutes; frame 112.
I've got to use that - I've got to roll right.
Time, Frank?
16:55.
Turn it to f/8 if you haven't got it there already.
That's where it was when you handed it to me.
Good.
17:15.
Okay.
Fresh impact crater: Mag E, frame 117, about 18 minutes.
Will you give me a Verb 64, Frank?
I've got a bunch of scarps here - they're to be shot - would you give me the end tape...
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, frame - hope I'm not losing count here.
Okay, definitely frame 114, target of opportunity, extremely fresh impact crater.
Time: 75:39:30.
You going to rotate in 6 minutes, Bill?
Not now, I'm checking here.
Frame 115, another extremely fresh impact crater taken at 75:41. If the window was a little more clear, I - Looks like it might be up on the top of the hill.
What time you got, Frank? Is it 20?
25 almost. 24:19 now.
Okay, let's go.
Did they give you a time to rotate?
What?
Did they give you a time to rotate?
wants me to rotate 75:46.
Yes, we've got a - ways to go yet.
3 minutes - No, it's 5 minutes.
Okay, let's go - f/11.
