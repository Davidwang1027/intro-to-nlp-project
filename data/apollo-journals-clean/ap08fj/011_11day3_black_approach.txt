Houston. Apollo 8 with a radio check.
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear.
Oh, good evening, Jerry.
Howdy. The Black Watch is watching.
How do you read on this - how do you read on this antenna?
Loud and clear on that one, Bill.
It's Frank. Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Do you read on Omni C?
Apollo 8, Houston. Reading you loud with some background noise.
Roger. You're loud and clear. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Comm check.
Roger, Houston. This is Apollo 8. Loud and clear. How me?
Roger. Loud and clear, Jim.
Apollo 8, Houston; with a preliminary LOI-1 PAD. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
This is 8. Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston; with a preliminary LOI-1 PAD. Over.
Roger. Stand by one.
Roger. Standing by.
Houston, Apollo 8. Ready to copy.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Roger. LOI-1; SPS/G&N; 62844; minus 1.61, plus 1.29; 069:08:18.41. Copy?
8 is copying.
Roger, 8. Minus 2983.7, plus 0239.0, plus 0099.4; 000, 200, 005; 0169.3, plus 0060.0; 2994.9, 4:02, 2978.2. Copy?

Roger, Jim. One question - we talked about a P40 gimbal check. Would you like to do that during this maneuver to LOI-1 attitude, or would you rather hold that off until a little closer to LOI? Over.
Let me check on that. Wait one, Houston.
Roger. Standing by.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We could make this gimbal check as a maneuver to the LOI attitude.
Roger.
Understand that you'll load us up with the LOI-1 PAD and we'll run through P40 as far as the gimbal check.
Roger. That's what we heard you were going to do on it. Are you going to run both the manual gimbals as well as the automatic? Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Standing by to monitor P52. Over.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. P52 complete.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Copy.
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Loud and clear.
Okay, Jerry. At 67, we're going maneuver to the LOI-1 attitude, do a sextant star check, and then we'll have to go back to PTC. I want to know if you want us to go back to the same attitudes we are at now?
Apollo 8, Houston. That's affirmative. Break. We're getting ready to ask you to do an erasable dump, Verb 47. We're ginning up to get ready for it now, and we'll call you as soon as we're ready to copy.
Understand. Verb 47 when you call.
Negative; Verb 74.
Okay. Verb 74.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We're setting up for the dump now. It'll take about 3 minutes and 20 seconds once we start the dump. Over.
Understand.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. Can you point out the position of this Zeta Perseus to us a little better? We don't have it marked on our charts. We have got Mirfak, and we know Algol, but which one is Zeta Perseus?
Roger, Frank. Persei Zeta is just about exactly between Aldebaran and Mirfak.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We're ready for your CMC erasable dump. Key Verb 74 Enter. Over.
Roger.
Verb 74 Enter.
Did you get it?
Houston, Apollo 8. Are you getting the dump?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Indications are that we're getting it; we're checking. You'll have to leave the computer alone for 3 minutes and 20 seconds. Over.
Roger. We are.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're getting your dump low bit rate through Honeysuckle.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Persei Zeta is a third magnitude star same as Enif. Over.
Same magnitude as Enif.
Affirmative.
Okay.
Jerry, when are you going to send us the TEI-1 and the rest of that block data?
Apollo 8, Houston. PC plus 2 does not need an update. We'll have your TEI-1 and 2 in about 10 minutes. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. The dump is complete; you can have your computer back. The reason for the dump was to investigate further the P52 anomaly you had about 4 hours ago. We'll try to have some words for you in about 20 or 30 minutes. Over.
You mean when it wouldn't come up with the proper star?
Affirmative.
Okay.
We're going to go ahead and start our maneuver to LOI-1 attitude.
Roger. Standing by to monitor.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Houston. Go ahead.
Earlier in the flight, I noticed that the auto optics wouldn't drive to the star pick-a-pair selected. For example, we - it picked Alpheratz at one time, wouldn't drive there, and we drove to a spot that had no star; and I went back and reselected the program and came back, and it worked okay.
Roger, Jim. Copy.
Jim; is this anomaly you're talking about - was that 4 hours ago when we did the REFSMMAT align?
This happened, I think, yesterday. When we - we were doing a regular REFSMMAT alignment. Alpheratz was the first star selected, and it didn't drive to Alpheratz; and I went in and reselected the program again, and it worked okay.
Okay, Jim. Thanks.
Jerry, this is Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8 here, Jerry.
Go ahead, Frank.
Our PAD here hadn't been - Roger. Our PAD hasn't been correct. I understand the gimbal angles for LOI-1 are roll 0, pitch 200, and yaw 5. Is that correct?
Affirmative, Frank. That is correct.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston with a map update. Over.
Okay. Stand by a minute.
Roger.
Go ahead.

How do you read now, Houston?
Apollo 8, Houston. Reading you loud and clear. No TM.
Understand. No TM.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. How far are you from your gimbal drive check? Over.
We're just maneuvering to the attitude now.
Roger, Frank. Can you lock up the High Gain at that attitude? We have a telemetry problem. Over.
We'll try to. I don't know if we can or not; have to wait 'til we get there.
Roger. Standing by.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. We cannot get the High Gain at the burn attitude.
Roger, Frank. Thanks anyway.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We have a handover from Honeysuckle to Guam in about two minutes.
Thank you.

We can start the gimbals check right here.
Roger. You want to copy while you're doing it or stand by on TEI-1?
Stand by for a minute.
Roger. Standing by.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Shifting command back to Honeysuckle. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. How did that gimbal drive check go?
It went fine.
Roger, Frank. We're ready with the TEI-1 and 2 maneuver PADs. We've also got two state vectors and a target load to uplink and load if you'll configure for it. Over.
Roger. We're trying to get the High Gain now. We're maneuvering back to PTC attitude.

Apollo 8, Houston. Request you switch your Omni. It's getting pretty garbled now.
Roger. Stand by.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. I copied. I question the latitude and the range to go. It appears that you gave me one too few digits in both cases.
Roger. I repeat, latitude plus 09.20, minus 165.00; 1295.3, 36175, 146:32:16. Copy?

Roger. Thank you. We have the computer; we're in Block.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We'd like to make, at this time, a down-voice backup comm check. Set the S-band Aux, Tape to Down-Voice Backup, TLM inputs PCM, Low. Over.
Roger, Houston. And we'd like to have a check of our DSE on low bit rate for voice.
Roger. Understand you want the DSE check on low bit rate for voice.
That's affirmative, and we'll give it - we'll give it about 10 minutes now or about 5 minutes, then you can check it out.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
As a matter of interest, we have yet to see the Moon.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. What else are you seeing?
Nothing. It's like being on the inside of a submarine.
Roger.
Houston, we just ran a Program 21. We show a pericynthion of plus 74.9 (nautical) miles with the state vector you just uploaded.
Roger. Plus 74.9.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Reading your down-voice backup loud and clear. Request you keep those switches where they are for the remainder of the pass. Over.
Roger. And I'm rewinding the tape recorder for a dump - for a DSE voice check.
Roger, 8.
It's rewound; are you ready to dump?
We'd like to go to S-band Aux, Tape, briefly so you can dump the tape while we're on the High Gain. We've only got about 30 seconds worth.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. We'll do that from the ground. Over.
Roger. And our switch configuration is Down-voice Backup and Stop. And you've got it?
Roger. We'll dump it.
You won't need to dump more than about a minute's worth.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. That pericynthion you read out is for ignition. We read that as 75 (nautical) miles; your true pericynthion is 64 miles at 69:10:35. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston with an addition to your TEI-1 maneuver PAD. Over.
Stand by a minute.
Go ahead.
Roger. Under remarks, add the following: "requires minus MA procedure". Over.
Requires minus MA procedure.
Affirmative, 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. At 68:04, you're Go for LOI.
Okay. Apollo 8 is Go.
Apollo 8, Houston. You're riding the best one we can find around.
Say again.
You're riding the best bird we can find. Over.
Thank you.
Roger. It's a good one.
The cryo's have been stirred, Houston.
Roger, Bill.
Apollo 8, Houston. We just saw an MC&W light.
We just tested the caution and warning.
Roger.
That's keeping alert.
Roger. Clint there is getting white.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're 42 minutes from LOS, and we caught another caution and warning light.
That was the High Gain Antenna going out of limits.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. The voice quality on the DSE dump is very good. The DSE is yours. Over.
Mighty fine.
Apollo 8, Houston. Comm check.
Read you loud and clear, Houston.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We're ready to activate the primary water boiler.
Roger. Copy.
We got a Go?
Roger. Go.
Okay. Steam pressure going to Auto; H2 flow going to Auto.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're on low bit rate. We won't see your steam pressure; your Rad Out is 33. Over.
Roger. We're below the boiling limit, and steam pressure is steady at 0.15.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We've got our lunar map up and ready to go.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We're showing a fuel pressure of 167, an Ox(idizer pressure) of 163. Wondering, do you think there's a possibility of us having a transient Caution/Warning trip on fuel/Ox pressure at the beginning of the burn that would correct itself nominally as we had a chance to pressurize? Over.
Roger. Understand; will check. Stand by.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We've been reading fuel 173, Ox 167; holding steady for a long period of time. We expect no Caution and Warning trip. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. Nine minutes, 30 seconds from LOS.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. In about 10 seconds, we'll have you 19 minutes from ignition. Five, four, three, two, one...
Mark.
Apollo 8, Houston. Five minutes LOS, all systems Go. Over.
Thank you. Houston, Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. The custard's in the oven at 350. Over.
No comprendo.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Two minutes until LOS.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. One minute to LOS. All systems Go.
Roger. Going to Command Reset, tape recorder Forward, low bit rate.
Roger. Safe journey, guys.
Thanks a lot, troops.
We'll see you on the other side.
What's this...
What's that LOS time, Bill?
58:58 - 68:58.
See if we lose the signal then.
Okay.
What was the seconds? Jim?
I didn't bother with it; wasn't it something like 58:02?
Apollo 8, 10 seconds to go. You're Go all the way.
Roger.
