Apollo 8, this is Houston. How do you read?
I read you loud and clear; my comm here must have come unconnected.
Roger, Bill. We lost data on you for about 15 minutes and voice comm for about 45 and were beginning to get a little itchy. Is your PTC set up for Rate Command attitude hold? [Pause.]
Roger. Pitch and roll is in PTC
Roger. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Set up Omni Charlie. Over. [Long pause.]
Roger. Omni Charlie.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We're showing yaw 54.5. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. It's been deadband right around there the whole time. [Long pause.]
You can take command P00, also, if you want to. You might have to use it again.
Apollo 8, Houston. Say again. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
You can take over command P00; you might have to use it again.
Roger, Bill. [Pause.]
I'm trying to be quiet so the other guys can sleep, Jerry.
Roger, Bill.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston.
Go ahead.
Switch to Omni Bravo, and we'll try the Bravo-Delta switching again. Over. [Pause.]
You got it.
You blew it.
We're on Omni B now, Houston.
Roger, Bill. [Pause.]
Looks like B couldn't quite hack it; I'll put it back there in a minute.
Roger.
Houston, if EECOMs need any more help, just tell them to give me a call.
Roger.
We're going on Omni Bravo now, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
Omni Bravo.
Roger. Omni Bravo.
Apollo 8, Houston. Looks like we're getting pretty far off in both pitch and yaw. Showing about 50 degrees in pitch and about 25 in yaw.
Roger. I get that.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. All systems looking good. Over.
Apollo 8. Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Your systems are all looking good. Got a Flight Plan update for you: at time 96, you can delete P52. Your drift rates are real small. [Pause.]
Roger. And I'd like to do the chlorination at about 95:30 if I could.
Roger. Understand; chlorination: 95:30. Okay? [Long pause.]
And Houston, we're on Omni C and going to Bravo now - correction, Dog.
Roger. Understand; going Delta. [Pause.]
We're on - we're on Charlie now.
Roger. Understand you're on Charlie. Break. Verify your Up TLM switch is - Command Reset is at Normal. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. It's in Normal. I've had it Command Reset since we broke lock there, and I had to get back and control the omnis, so why don't you go command it over to Dog. Then give it back, and I'll set the other one on Bravo.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We have you on Delta; you can go to Bravo. Break. Give us a call when you've finished your chlorination. Over.
Okay. Everybody seems to be stirring around now, so we'll probably just do it on time.
Okay.
Houston, and the other two space aces are up now, and LMP's going to hit the pad and like to take a Seconal prior.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Permission granted, Bill. Have a good sleep.
Thank you. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Looks like you'll need about 3 more hours on that battery A charging. Over.
Okay. Well, my cohorts can handle it.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Can we get a crew status report on Bill before he goes to sleep?
He's feeling fine. [Pause.] A little sleepy.
Roger.
And had a meal about - had a meal about 2 hours ago; drinking lots of water.
Roger, Bill. Thanks.
Okay.
Good night. [Pause.]
Good night. Wish everybody a Merry Christmas for me.
Sure will, Bill. Same to you. [Long pause.]
Thanks. [Pause.]
Make sure Bill hangs up his stocking before he goes to bed. [Pause.]
I've got it right next to my teddy bear.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We're - we're up and on the job; Bill's going to sleep; just thought I'd let you know.
Roger, Frank. Good morning.
Good morning.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. I have a little feature news and sports news for you if you'd like to hear it. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. I have some feature page and sports page news if you'd like it.
Roger.
Roger. First of all, Frank, the guys down here on the consoles want to spread their appreciation for a beautiful television job done. [Pause.]
Thank you.
Roger. We'll start out with the sports news. Los Angeles Dodger pitcher, Sandy Koufax, and Ann Widmark, 23-year-old daughter of actor Richard Widmark, plan to marry sometime in the near future. Koufax said Tuesday that no date for the wedding was set, but he and Miss Widmark have been dating for some time. At Springfield...
[Garble] again.
Say again. [Pause.]
Morning. How do you read?
Morning, Jim. [Pause.]
Let's see. In Springfield, Missouri, Mickey Owen, the old-time catcher for the Brooklyn Dodgers who made the record books by dropping a third strike that led the New York Yankees to a victory over the Dodgers in the '41 World Series, decided that he would be remembered by more than just his sports record. Forty-five boys and girls have been the recipients of ponies that he offered. These youngsters were requested to send letters in telling him how they would care of a pony. When the letters poured in, he added five ponies to the 20 he already offered; and other donors pitched in 20 more. And said Mickey Owen, "I thought I'd have about 45 letters, but I ended up with about 900." Now on the feature page: Wellington, New Zealand, about fifty men sat down to the traditional turkey and cranberry sauce at the South Pole today, but the Christmas dinner had an Oriental flavor, as well. It included Sukiyaki cooked by members of a Japanese party who are crossing the Antarctic continent and stopped for the day at the U.S. Navy Polar base. [Pause.] In San Diego, California, the crewmen of the captured intelligence ship Pueblo donated their first paychecks to the workers at San Diego's Balboa Naval Hospital. They had all been given twenty dollars each, and - when they landed in San Diego - and they felt that this was a good demonstration of their feelings for those who had done so much to make her welcome here. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We read your antenna change. You still reading us?
Roger. This is Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger.
We just now changed antennas, or you must have.
Okay.
You lost...
In Reno, Nevada... [Pause.] Oh, that's affirmative, Frank. We changed the antenna from here.
Thank you.
In Reno, Nevada, because there's no fireplace in his home, [garble] a little boy wrote Santa Claus in care of the local newspaper and suggested, "Would you please use the front door. You'll have to kick the bottom a little bit because it sticks." In Little Rock, Arkansas, babies born at St. Vincent Infirmary during the week before Christmas and through Christmas Day are being released to their mothers at discharge time in huge red Christmas stockings. [Pause.] Here's one in ecumenical cooperation. In Indio, California, the Chief of Police was armed, Christmas Day, with a prayer book. Rabbi Phillip H. Wienburg took over as Chief for a day so the real Police Chief, Homer Hunt, a Methodist, could spend the holiday with his family. This is the third straight Christmas the Rabbi has filled in for Hunt, The previous 6 years, Rabbi Weinburg did the same for the Roman Catholic Police Chief of Reno, Nevada. [Long pause.]
From the Associated Press, Americans watch Pope Paul celebrate Christmas Mass in Italy, and Europeans viewed a Christmas greeting from Apollo 8 via the most powerful communications satellite yet sent aloft. The views of Pope Paul and the Apollo 8 crew Tuesday night were the first to be relayed across the Atlantic commercially by Intelsat III, which was launched from Cape Kennedy last Wednesday. That's the one we saw go.
Roger. I remember that.
Intelsat is a 63-nation international communications consortium; provides a start on the first global communications network. The new satellite is scheduled to begin full commercial service on January 2nd, initially serving North and South America and Europe. Further coverage of the Apollo 8 mission is to be relayed to Europe this week. [Pause.]
From Washington: "This Christmas, the world is brightened with the hope of peace. When it comes, when hope turns to substance and the guns are quiet once again, it will come because you have pursued it with courage and skill." This was a message from President Johnson to the Armed Forces on Christmas [Pause.]
Here's a feature by Harry Rosenthal of Associated Press. It says: from Houston. Two Santas brighten the Christmas Eve for 2-year-old Jeffrey Lovell. The first one knocked on his front door and brought presents. The second started his daddy home from the Moon. The first wore a red suit and a white beard and ho, ho'd, loud enough to be heard down the block. The second was a huge engine spitting flame behind the Moon, and thousands of people are awaiting - were awaiting word that it had fired. "Please be informed that there is a Santa Claus." were the first words from Apollo 8 as it emerged from radio silence to inform an anxious world, 15 minutes after the fact, that the engine had performed its critical burn. "None of us expect to ever have a better Christmas present than this one." said Ken Mattingly at Mission Control. "Thank everyone on the ground for us. You know we couldn't have done it without you," came the reply from Col, Frank Borman, the spacecraft commander. At this point, a Christmas the tree came aglow in front of the consoles in Mission Control, and Astronaut Harrison Schmitt read a space version of "A visit from Saint Nicholas" to the crew. "'Twas the night before Christmas, and way out in space, the Apollo 8 crew had just won the Moon race," it began. The Mission Control crew had delayed its celebration until Jeffrey's daddy, Navy Captain James Lovell, along with Air Force Major William A. Anders and Col. Borman were safely on their way home. Any other Christmas Eve, the families of the three astronauts would have been in church for Christmas services, but this year they were all glued to their television sets. The homes all near the Manned Spacecraft Center were decorated. The lawn around the Lovell home and throughout his community of Timber Cove was lined with Mexican-style luminarios, and the four Lovell children came out to light them atabout 7:30. They were just in time. At 8:00, a car drove up carrying a tall Santa Claus with a large sack on his back. He ho ho'd up to the door and knocked loudly. It opened, and there stood Jeffrey Lovell, who will be 3 on January 14th. Jeffrey recoiled at the sight. His mother held him up. Jeffrey clung to her, still shying away. "Last year he ran away crying," saying his 15-year-old sister Barbara. Earlier, she had to run after him to prevent his blowing out all the luminarios. The other Lovell children, 13-year-old James and 10-year-old Susan watched with great amusement. Finally, the Santa and the children disappeared inside; the presents were put under the tree; not to be opened until today. Mrs. Lovell prepared eggnog and cookies for the guests, and they watched a 25-minute televised tour of the Moon conducted by the three astronauts. Later, friends took Mrs. Lovell, Barbara, and Jeffrey on a tour of the neighborhood, brightly lighted for Christmas. Above them in a clear sky, the quarter Moon shone brightly, and the three astronauts, who more than any other men have seen the fruits of creation, pause in their scientific exploration there to beam to the Earth the majestic word; from Genesis. "And God created the firmament heavens, and God called the dry land, Earth, and God saw that it was good." [Pause.]
Thank you, Jerry.
Roger. We have a newspaper coming in after a while; and we'll give you a little more news later.
Thank you, Jerry; that's nice. [Long pause.]
Jerry, we have chlorinated the water. We're changing the canister now.
Roger, Frank. Copy.
Apollo 8, Houston. Would you put the Biomed switch to the left, and we'd like a crew...
Roger.
...status report on Jim and Frank when you get a chance. [Long pause.]
Houston, both Frank and myself had a meal before bed last night, and I believe we had about 20 clicks of water, and a good night's rest. Just getting up.
Roger, Jim. Thank you.
Jerry, this is Frank. Do you have any later word on our trajectory and how the charging looks?
Roger. Stand by, Frank. We'll give you an update. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We're looking at a midcourse correction at 104 hours of about 5 feet per second. Your tracking is real good. We got you in the center of the corridor and on target.
Understand; 5 feet per second at 104 hours.
That's affirm. [Long pause.]
Frank, did you get the word that we deleted the P52 at 96 (hours)?
Roger. Do you mind if we go ahead and do it now?
Negative; we've deleted it. Your drift rates are so small that you don't even need to unless you want to do it.
Okay. We won't.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Frank. In 3 minutes, we're handing the control from Honeysuckle over to Madrid. Over.
Thank you.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Buenos dias from Madrid.
[Garble] reading [garble] now.
Apollo 8, Houston. Reading you loud and very noisy.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear. How me?
You're loud and clear now.
Hi, Jerry, this is Frank. Do you read me?
Roger, Frank.
Okay. I wasn't sure we were lined up. Thank you. Enough [garble].
Apollo 8, Houston. If you don't need the computer, we'd like to have you call up Verb 64 Enter so that we can do the B-D antenna switching from the ground. Over. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Jim, if you don't need the computer, would you call up Verb 64 Enter, and we'll take care of the antenna B-D switching down here. Over.
Roger.
We just did an automatic maneuver and then get on back to PTC attitude.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. All your systems looking good. Over.
Thank you, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. I got some more newspaper you if would like to hear it.
We would enjoy it.
Roger. We'll start out with the world news. On page 1 of the Houston Post: praise for America's Apollo 8 astronauts and hopes for international cooperation in space exploration with the worldwide Christmas Eve messages as the tiny spaceship orbited the Moon. Even in the Communist world, there was enthusiasm for man's first voyage to the Moon. In Moscow, Soviet scientist Anatoly Besaranov recalled his country and the United States had shared space knowledge before and predicted the Apollo 8 flight would lead to more cooperation. In Cuba, Radio Havana rebroadcast the Voice of America program to tell its listeners of the Apollo 8 speech. Voice officials said it was the first time that any of the U.S. agencies' programs had been carried by Havana radio. Czechoslovakia saw the Moon flight through extensive television coverage; and in Budapest, Hungary, people talk of little else on the trains and buses. In the non-Communist world, office workers and Christmas shoppers held their breath as the spacecraft was readied for the blast toward Earth. Frenchmen in the street praised American know-how and the space feat, and some viewers watch television lunar photos cheer "Magnifique!". In London, swarms of Christmas shoppers crowded into shops and pubs to watch television photographs of the Moon's craters. Britain's foremost space astronomer, Sir Bernard Lovell, who a few weeks ago criticized the Apollo 8 project on the grounds that the instruments could do the job without risking astronauts' lives, made it clear that he was deeply impressed by the Moon flight. Pope Paul IV said honor to those pioneers of the extension of man's intellect and activity. There were only a few scrooges to "pooh-pooh" the Christmas voyage, however. The most notable was Samual Shenton, secretary of London's Flat Earth Society, who said the public are being balihooed, taken for a ride. [Pause.] How does that grab you, Frank?
It doesn't look too flat from here, but I don't know; maybe something is wrong with our vision.
Roger. Elsewhere in the world news, the Pueblo crew landed at NAS Miramar yesterday afternoon at 14:00, and they'll spend a few days there in Balboa Hospital with their families celebrating Christmas. On the local scene here, the - on the local scene, the Retail Merchants' Association has announced that its Christmas gift exchange policy was going to be the same this year as it was last year; that is, very liberal. Fellows, we'll be glad to replace any broken items that you might bring back, too; but, sorry, there won't be any cash refunds.
Okay.
Another little bit of local news: the County Court House at Huntsville burned down before dawn yesterday, so, looks like they're going to go into the construction business there again. On the feature page: got a little bit about the waiting families. This one is by Ann James, Post reporter. "We rest on the backside of the Moon," said Valerie Anders on Christmas Eve, as she and her family waited for Apollo 8 to get out of the Moon orbit and head back toward home. Mrs. Anders had been up since 2:00 am Tuesday, and neighbors had just collected all the youngsters so the family could get some rest while the spacecraft was behind the Moon and out of communication. Colonel Frank Borman's home is decorated with four big evergreen wreaths outdoors, sprinkled with powdery snow and decked with red bows. A tree in the den awaits his safe return, and his pretty blonde wife Sue and husky sons, Frederick and Edwin, plan to stay home for the midnight blast out of Moon orbit. Ordinarily, they would attend midnight services at St. Christopher's Episcopal Church. The plans were for the family to go to the Christmas Day service at 7:00 am. Since there are no young children in the Borman home, family Christmas gift giving will simply wait until Colonel Borman comes back with his fantastic holiday gift of a flight to the Moon and back. Marilyn Lovell's four youngsters will have an absolutely normal Christmas as far as the kids are concerned, the busy wife of Captain Lovell reported; but talking about presents was out because two of them were sitting right there next to her. "I haven't even had time to change my clothes that I wore last night," Mrs. Lovell said. Adult-to-adult gifts, however, and the Christmas tree will soon be right there when Lovell - will still be right there when Lovell comes home. [Pause.] Here's a good one on the Action Line. There's a little letter to the Action editor. It says, "We intended to pay you Earthlings a surprise visit by a flying saucer last night. We got scared off by some crazy antics of a fat man and a sleigh and three guys in a rocket-powered bucket drag racing around the Moon. Is that any way to run a planet?" Signed the boys from Mars. [Pause.] Frank, it looks like about the only people around here who aren't impressed by Apollo 8 is the stock market. Its 30 industrials are down 1.43.
Neil will be crying.
(Laughter) You bet. On the sports page, not too much activity. UCLA is tops in both basketball polls. If you got any - any particular one you want to ask about, let me know, and I'll tell you if it's in the top ten on either poll. As far as the North - the college All Star game that's going to be played tomorrow is concerned, the North is a slight favorite over the South. Ara Parsegian is the coach of the North team, and he's got six of the Notre Dame troops working for him, so they ought to be pretty tough. The coach of the South team is Frank Howard of Clemson. He says it ain't easy, he quipped, to build a team in 4 days to play Notre Dame. Another little item of interest in the sports page is Woody Hayes from Ohio State was named Coach of the Year by the Football Writers' Association. Well, that's about it. Any questions?
No. Thank you very much, Jerry.
Okay, Frank.
Jerry, you can do this every Sunday.
Do you want me to read you the funnies?
No, thanks. [Long pause.]
Hey, Frank, did you get the word that - that Fred made all-district football team?
Yes, thank you. I heard about that before - before the lift-off.
Yeah. I thought you'd heard about that. Now, back to the workaday; we need a cryo fan cycle from you. [Pause.]
We're starting it right now.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Jerry, in a little while, I'd like to try out a little P37 exercise based on the minus MA. I'll just run one through, and maybe we can get a solution from the ground and see how they compare.
Okay, Jim. [Long pause.]
Retro says they are ready to copy.
Roger. [Pause.]
That performance at LOI was absolutely fantastic. You all really hit it on the money; I just couldn't believe it. [Pause.]
Roger. Thanks. Kinda surprised us, too.
Uh-uh. I hope you're not getting close to the Earth. We got another corridor to hit, you know.
We haven't quit yet.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
We'd like to use the computer now if you don't need it now, we'll [garble] from here.
Roger, Jim. It's yours.
Thank you.
If you can switch it down there without Verb 64, well, go ahead and do it. [Pause.]
We'll give it a whirl, Frank.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Fans are off. The tanks have all been stirred.
Roger. Thank you, Frank.
Roger. Are you still using the pitch and yaw for the PTC as 10 and 45, aren't you?
That's affirmative, Frank. Pitch, 10; yaw, 45.
Apollo 8, this is Houston with a battery status report.
Go ahead. We were just talking about the batteries.
Roger. At 96 hours GET, battery A has 38.95 amp-hours; battery B has 36.35 amp-hours; battery C has 38.46 amp-hours. Your total, 113.76 amp-hours. At 97 plus 50, battery A will be fully charged and will have 40 amp-hours, and you can terminate charge at that time. Over.
At 97:50.
Rog.
We'll give you back Verb 64, Houston. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
We gave you back Verb 64. And I wonder if you could have Guidance figure out a corridor correction at 114 hours for us, with a minus 6.48 gamma.
Okay, Jim. We copy, and we see we've got the Verb 64 back. We'll be back with you in a minute.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We have a comparison now on your P37. [Pause.]
Roger.
Okay. Based on your vector, the CMC vector, the ground computes 15.3 feet per second on the midcourse, VEI of 36221, a gammaEI of minus 6.51 so it looks like your P37 program is pretty good. Applying your P37 solution to our MSFN vector, however, we get a gammaEI of minus 10.32. We expect these two solutions to converge with a little more tracking and after you get some Earth horizon sightings. Over.
Roger. How valuable do you think that the lunar sightings we did just after TEI are, as compared to your MSFN tracking [garble]?
Apollo 8, Houston. Repeat your question, please.
Roger. I was getting curious of the value of onboard tracking in the P23 close to the Moon, in regards to the MSFN tracking that close to the Moon. I think there might be a trade-off for onboard navigation, and I think it might be a little bit better than MSFN [garble].
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. I guess the experts would say that the MSFN data was probably best based on the number of sightings that you've taken. However, that's going to be the subject of quite a bit of evaluation, I think, after the mission. Over.
[Garble.]
Roger, Jim. Be advised that we are beginning to read you very weak, and with a rather loud background noise.
Understand. I think we ought to [garble]. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read now?
I'm reading - I'm reading you loud and clear.
Roger. Still reading you weak but clearer.
Apollo 8, Houston. You can turn off the battery charger. Over.
Roger. Will do.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Is this Jim?
Roger.
Roger, Jim. Christmas morning around your house was kinda quiet, says Marilyn. She said that they're all thankful that the mission has gone so great. They missed having you around the tree this morning, but they wanted to reassure you that your presents are waiting, and the roast beef and Yorkshire pudding will be on the table when you get home.
Hey, that sounds good, Jerry - good old roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.
Yeah, man. Is Frank listening?
Say hello to them for me, will you?
Sure will. Is Frank listening?
Frank's not on the - Frank's not on the line yet; he'll be shortly.
Okay. How about Bill? Is he still asleep?
Bill's still asleep.
Okay. Have Frank give me a holler when he's ready. I've got a message for him, too.
Okay. Sounds good. How's your Christmas, Jerry?
Real good, Jim. Santa Claus struck last night before I came in here on the shift, and I guess we'll finish off the unwrapping this morning when I get back.
Right. He was looking for a chimney on (spacecraft) 103 here, but he didn't see any.
[Laughter.] You could have left the hatch unlocked for him. [Pause.]
I'll think about that one.
Think real hard, Jim. [Long pause.] EECOM says he could have slid down the steam duct. [Pause.]
Sounds good. About that time, Bill would have been boiling water. [Long pause.]
Hi, Jerry, this is Frank. What's up?
Hi, Frank. Christmas morning has come at the Borman house. And the boys and Susan and your Mom and Dad all send their love. They say for you to stay in there and pitch. Over.
Okay. Thank you. Please reciprocate for me.
Sure will, Frank. [Pause.]
Frank, when Bill wakes up, give me a holler. I've got a message for him, too.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. Are the Guidance boys busy this morning? [Pause.]
They say they are. [Pause.]
I just worked out an answer to move my landing longitude 30 degrees east, and I just want to compare with what they've got based on the same burn time of 114 hours, based on the bias impact longitude determined from the P37 which is wrong. I've indicated that I needed a 600-foot-per-second Delta-VC burn plus, and my Delta-VX changes from a minus 11.6 feet per second. I'd like to have them verify that if I could.
Roger Jim. Stand by, and I'll see if they copied all that. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
The voice isn't too great right now, and the Guidance troops didn't get all of that. How about waiting about 2 or 3 minutes? We'll swap Omni antennas, and then we should get good voice transmissions from you and then repeat it. Would you, please?
Will do.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read? Over.
Loud and clear.
Roger. We're reading you much better now. Jim can go ahead with his transmission to the guidance troops. They have one question before he starts. They would like to know what his GERU was at TIG, 114 hours. Over.
Roger. Wait one. The GERU at TIG was plus 07972.
Roger. Plus 07972.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We're ready to copy your data. Over.
Okay, Houston. Based on the P37 with minus MA solution, I got an impact longitude of minus 160.95. I biased it to get an impact latitude - longitude of 163.75. I wanted to change my impact point 30 degrees to the east, and I tried to determine what my P30 burn parameters would be to do this, and I got a Delta-VX burn of a minus 11.6 and a Delta-VC of plus 600, Delta-VY of zero. Now that changed my previous Delta-VX burn from minus 50.2. I just want to know whether that meets with their approval.
Roger, Jim. We copy and we'll run it through the mill and give you an answer.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston with a Flight Plan update.
Go ahead.
Roger. At 100 hours, 30 minutes, change star number 02 from one set to two sets. Over.
Roger. Star 02 from one set to two sets.
Roger. Also, set number 2, set number 2, change star number 11 to star 7. Over.
Roger. Eleven to Seven.
Roger. Then after star set number 3, initiate PTC again; pitch, 10; yaw, 45. Over.
Pitch, 10; yaw, 45.
Roger. Then at 101 hours, 30 minutes; delete the Earth horizon settings. Over. [Pause.]
101:30, delete the Earth horizon sightings.
That's affirmative. The folks here are evaluating the thermal situation. Looks like you'll be out of PTC for a rather extended period of time. That's the reason why we have you initiating PTC again there around 101 as soon as you finish those three star sightings. We're still working on the - about the next 10 hours after 100 hours, we're looking at the thermal situation, and the star sighting situation, and we'll be giving you more updates later on. Over.
Roger. We don't have a thermal problem at all now, do we? All our indications here are normal in here.
Roger. Everything looks okay. I think they're just kinda trying to look down the track aways.
I'm all for keeping it that way.
Roger.
We deleted them.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Frank, I'd like to talk to you for a minute or two about the auto optics funnies that you've been seeing throughout the mission. Over.
Go ahead. [Garble, perhaps 'Jim's listening.']
Roger. The problems you've run into so far are due to some unknown source, probably EMI (Electro-Magnetic Interference) or the like loading your CMC trunnion cell which is now 91, so that it doesn't really represent your true trunnion angle. Now this loading problem, we don't feel implies any decrease in the reliability in your CMC at all. We think that the best way to circumvent the problem is to cycle the Optics Zero switch first to Off and then On prior to using the optics for any purpose. And with that procedure, I think you probably won't have any more problem. Over.
Roger, Jerry. Understand. I do notice one difference. We did two preferred REFSMMATs. The first one we had trouble with; the last one worked out as expected. And I noticed that for the first one that when the option came up, it was for a nominal option, whereas for the very same procedure for this last REFSMMAT change, we got the preferred REFSMMAT option when we called up the program.
Roger, Jim. Copy.
Apollo 8, this is Houston with a comeback on your entry navigation calculations. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. We went through the charts and got exactly the same answer as you got. It looks like your procedure is very good; looks like it was real good head. You remembered to average out the velocity. We also went ahead and computed the problem to verify the chart and got a good solution. Over.
Roger.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Now if we can get our state vectors to agree, we'll be in business.
No sweat.
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Frank. Is Jim listening?
Listening.
Roger. On your question about the option: Program 40 fits the preferred flag such that the next P52 will come up option 1, subsequent alignments after that come up option 2. Over.
Rog. Understand. So 40 set up with the TEI burn, put in an option 1 for us.
Roger. Now concerning your restart that happened in lunar orbit, for the peace of mind of the computer people and the MIT folks, we have a question. Did Verb 34 Enter to a flashing Verb 51 in P22 cause your restart? Over.
Yeah. That sounds like it was it.
Roger. Thank you, Jim.
That must be a "no, no".
Yes, Yes. That's a "no, no".
That almost caused an unscheduled EVA, too.
Apollo 8, Houston. Biomed switch center. Over. [Long pause.]
Three, two, one...
...Mark.
Roger. Your mark.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. It's about time for us to start keeping track of some Command Module RCS temperatures; so when you get a chance, we'd like a reading now, and we'll try to repeat it about every 8 hours or so.
Okay. We'll get them for you right now.
Roger. [Pause.]
You want the motor off the test meter, right?
That's affirmative. [Pause.]
The 5C is pegged high.
Roger. 5C pegged high.
5D is pegged high.
Roger. D, high.
So's 5D. [Long pause.] 6A is high; 6B is high; 6C is 5 volts; 6D is pegged high.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Understand. 5C and 5D are pegged high; 6A and 6B are pegged high; 6 Charlie is 5 volts; and 6 Delta pegged high. Over.
That's Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're showing quad A running a little bit warmer than the other quads. If you remember, I mentioned before that we were coming into a period of time here where we were going to spend a lot of time with no PTC going. We'd like you to try to favor quad A if you can in the shade, and do whatever you can to keep that temperature from getting out of hand. Over.
Roger. I'm only reading 121 on quad A.
Roger. [Pause.]
Quad C is the highest temperature we have; it's 142. [Long pause.]
Roger, Frank. We're more interested in the tank temperatures than the quad temperatures. Over.
Roger. I understand. Now listen, if you think it is that important, let's just keep PTC-ing it and not even do anything.
Negative. There's no sweat right now. We're watching it, and we just wanted to let you know that this thing is being - being looked at. If we get anywhere near a situation where we feel we ought to change, we'll go back to PTC or cool it.
Okay. Thank you. We'll do our best, but it is kind of hard, though. You are sort of subject of spatial geometry: wherever the stars and the Moon happens to be, that's where you point.
Roger. We understand. We're going to keep an eye on it down here, and we'll keep you appraised.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Pass the word to Jim that on these marks that are coming up, pretty important that he remember to record his Delta-R and Delta-V and trunnion. We're working low bit rate down here, and so we're not going to be able to record that data from here. Over.
We're recording them all. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. Did you read that we are recording all the Delta-R, Delta-V and trunnion [garble].
Roger, Frank. Thanks.
Jerry, Apollo 8.
Roger. Go ahead.
As luck would have it, we got the Sun almost directly on top of us here.
Roger. We understand, but that tank temperature is holding steady, so we're all right.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. The helium tank temperature that we're watching on quad A has only gone up 1 degree in all this work that you're doing, so we don't consider it to be too terribly serious. What we'd like to do, as soon as you've finish this P23 work, is rather than go back into PTC, let's just roll her over 180 degrees and put quad A on the cool side, and hold it that way until your next activity comes up, which is around 102:30. Over.
Okay. Fine.
Okay, Jerry. We're through with Program 23. We're just going to roll here to get the Sun off quad A then, if that's what you want.
Roger, Frank. Good deal.
It should be getting cool now, Jerry.
Roger, Frank. So far we haven't seen the temperature start back down again. We expect to see it, though. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. Give us the word if you want us to maneuver back here before that time, will you please.
Wilco.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Frank. We have some data that was missed on your P23. We'd like you to read it down to us if you have time.
Roger. We will in just a minute.
Roger. [Pause.]
Go ahead. What do you want?
Roger. On star number 2, the sixth mark, we missed Delta-R and Delta-V.
Sixth mark, that's [pause]. Did Lovell tell you to do this? Come on, Carr; come clean. Did he ask you to ask for this?
Who?
Jim Lovell.
Negative. Uh-uh. We really missed it.
It's all zeros, and all zeros.
Roger. All zeros, all zeros. Okay. On star number 7, we missed the trunnion on marks 1, 2, and 3.
On 1, the trunnion was 03235; on 2, it was 03240; and on 3, it was 03241.
Okay, Frank. And then the last one is on star number 1; we missed the trunnion on mark 5.
04064.
Roger, 04064.
Righto.
Thank you, Frank.
You're welcome, Jerry.
That Lovell's getting pretty proficient.
Not bad.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Was that last number you read down to me mark 2 on star number 1? [Pause.]
That's right. Star number 1, mark 2.
Roger. Thank you. That's one gotcha on guidance.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. You're back under our influence again. Over.
Very good. Things should start speeding up now, huh?
Roger. You've been in for about 20 minutes.
Very good.
Jerry, this is Jim.
Go ahead, Jim.
Find out from the Guidance troops if a midcourse maneuver of minus 4.8 to access [garble] at 14 hours would be better than the 15.2 I came up with first.
Okay. Minus 4.8.
Right.
We've already started checking it, Jim. I bet you thought you sneaked that P37 past us.
Big brother is watching.
Affirm.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.[No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. I just wondered how the temperature on quad A tank is doing.
We've seen no improvement as yet, Frank.
How hot is it?
86 degrees [F, 30°C].
Right.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Frank, we're going to establish a range sequence now. We'd like to try to keep silent on the net for about 3 minutes. Over.
Very well.
Apollo 8, Houston. Range sequence complete. Over.
Thank you.
Hello, Houston. Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear. [Long pause.]
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear. How me?
I wasn't reading you for a while. I read you loud and clear now.
Roger, Frank. [Pause.]
I wanted to know what a range sequence test was, Jerry.
I was afraid you'd ask that. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. This range sequence thing is - is a phenomenon we get on down-voice backup; in this mode, the ranging and the voice share the same channel, so we have to periodically check to make sure that they're not interfering with each other. Over.
Thank you. These flights are very educational.
Roger. We are learning a little bit down here, too.
I hope you're not studying re-entry.
No, we're fat on those, Frank.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Frank. We'd like for you to go back into PTC now. Your helium tank temperature is still holding about the same. And we are going to try PTC to even things out. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Is Jim listening?
He's off the air right now.
Roger, Frank. Let him know that we've compared his latest P37, and the state vectors have converged to - they're very, very close now.
Your state vector and our state vector are very, very close.
That's affirmative, Frank.
Is that right, Jerry? Okay. I'll tell him. Thank you.
Roger. [Pause.]
Don't let his head get big, though.
You guys are making it impossible to live with him. It always was pretty hard.
