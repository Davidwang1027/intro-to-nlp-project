Houston, this is Apollo 8. We're Go for Pyro Arm. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. Do you read?
Houston, Apollo 8. Confirm Go for Pyro Arm.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. You're Go for Pyro Arm. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. You're Go for Pyro Arm. Everything's looking good.
Roger. Everything's looking good here, Ken.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. It appears that your primary evaporator may have dried out. If you get a chance, go ahead and give it a try to reservice. Over.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. Ground data indicates the primary evaporator may have dried out. If you have a chance, you might try reservicing. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. Your secondary loop looks good.
Roger, Houston.
ROT Control Power Direct, both, Main A/Main B.
Tape Recorder, you got that?
Roger. Horizon check.
He's doing that now.
Pitch needle error goes toward zero approaching zero at 0.5g time.
Okay.
Okay.
Don't forget Manual Attitude, three, to Rate Command.
... Command, that's right.
Yes. Okay, but tell me that later, okay?
Yes, right. Don't forget it.
You've got to do it in checklist... as we go.
I've got to have that; just tell me later, okay?
We're stopped right there.
How's your evaporator?
It's - it seems to be hanging in there, but it's awfully low steam pressure. I'll - I'll manually feed it if I have to.
Alright.
See where this baby wants me to fly? The pitch is way up.
See if [garble] of the alpha meter.
Now, as we come close to the horizon we're going to [garble].
[Garble].
As we come closer to the...
Yes. This thing came in long before. I thought it was going to at 45 degrees, where 152 is the nominal entry attitude.
Boy, it did come in wrong, didn't it?
Sure. See, I was waiting for that thing to come in. I didn't think it would come in until about 200 degrees.
How come we came in so soon?
I don't know.
Okay, evaporator's Go.
Good.
I'm pretty sure.
I keep wanting to yaw off the right here; It must be because we're boiling.
We're really boiling.
Okay, all - We're standing by now - You've got Manual Attitude, three, Rate Command when you get time. That's - We're down to there, and we are going to have a CMC Go or No-Go check. We've got two things to do: either the DAP's No-Go, which we'll find out when he flies it; If the CMC is No-Go, he'll fly the EMS.
You got the 0.05g and EMS Roll, On.
And that's an 0.05 change.
That's right.
Okay, it looks like we got the evaporator.
How's that needle doing?
Fine.
The horizon hard to find?
No.
I wish you'd keep checking my yaw for me there, will you?
I will. You're a little bit left now, or a little right - Go left, just a little bit.
Apollo 8, Houston. Looking good; both primary and secondary loops look good. [Long pause.]
I think you're slightly rolled - Roll right. Frank.
I don't care about the rolls.
Okay. We don't need any of that, Houston.
Okay.
Keep the horizon right there.
Apollo 8, through the Redstone. You're looking good; both primary and secondary loops are holding good. [Long pause.]
Roger; looks like we got it reserviced.
And we've got a good horizon.
Looks like you are yawing to the left or something.
No.
He's just about on, Bill.
I've got two separate sources in here that tell me my yaw's zero don't I? Actually, I can just fly those needles, now.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, through Redstone. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. It's Apollo 8.
Rog. Read you loud and clear. You're looking good.
Roger.
The control harmony is not too good in this. You get a lot more pitch than you do yaw and roll.
Hey there, you're yawing my way.
Look who's coming there, would you?
Yes.
You see it?
Yes.
Just like they promised.
What?
(LMP?) The Moon.
Oh.
At 6 minutes before, just like it says.
Okay. RRT is 46:13, we're 41:03.
Are you still Min Imp, Frank?
Yes.
That's right.
Okay.
That's where we stop, Man Attitude, three, Rate Command.
Well, I'm going to give her to the DAP anyway when we get down.
As soon as you see that needle starts going off the peg, huh?
Yes.
Yes, I would, too. Better see what she does.
Make sure the BMAG's are not changed - they're not. It'll be [garble] If they are.
Well, men, we're getting close.
There's no turning back now.
Old mother Earth has us.
We may end up losing our horizon here when that Moon goes down.
That's probably what makes your horizon so good is the Moon background - before it rose.
I wonder if [sounds like Dimlight Dunkleman] would like me to do a little airglow photography right now?
Yes.
Check - double check both balls for me, Jim, so...
Yes, you're okay.
We're not just reading one ball, okay?
Yes, this ball's agreeing with that one.
Well, we're 42:30...
Check your other (RCS) ring, just for sure, Jim.
There goes a washer; can you grab it?
Yes, I've been trying to get that washer...
...Well, It a too late now.
Well 42:02 and 46:13. We're at 42:47, 46:32
We're getting close to 0.05g, too.
Now's the - how high's the voltage?
Voltage is great; 28 volts.
Okay.
Okay, 152 will be the entry PAD. Pitch?
Okay. You're about to lose your Moon.
Okay, your yaw's looking good.
Got a lot of lightning down there, so you - you'll probably have something.
I got the old - Bill never saw that.
What is that?
Oh, did you notice? That's the haze level.
Airglow?
Airglow.
Good old airglow is what's...
I'll look at the airglow next time.
That's right, you've never seen the airglow. Take a look at it.
You can't get your [astronaut] pin without seeing the airglow.
That's right.
I see it! I see it! [Laughter.]
Let's see, is this where I'm supposed to ask how many g's, Lovell?
That's right [laughter], you ask how many g's.
How are we doing?
We're doing good over here.
Okay in the middle.
44:13; We're 2 minutes away from RRT.
Now that horizon's getting harder to find.
You're within 30 degrees of - of the attitude.
How do you know?
Well, 152 is it, and you're coming up on it now.
It's getting a, little hazy out here; does that mean anything - every time you fire a thruster.
We're starting to get some reflection off the Earth, I guess.
Did anybody ever see the service module?
Yes - No, excuse me.
Okay, your needle's coming up.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. One minute to RRT.
Roger.
Ready; 1, 2, 3, Rate Command
Rate Command
Okay.
The CMC in Auto?
I'm going there now, but - Now the CMC has got us.
Okay.
Okay, the pitch error is approaching zero?
Is the DAP Go?
DAP seems to be going.
Okay - -
Did you check out the horizon?
Manual Attitude, three, Rate Command?
Rate Command.
You've got the checklist again, Bill.
You got it?
Yes.
Yes.
BMAG, three, RATE 2.
RATE 2.
CMC in Auto.
CMC in Auto; Well, you don't need Auto, but I'll put it there and make everybody happy.
Okay, 0.05g is at 46:41...
You call 0.05g, Jim.
I'll call 0.05 - I'll tell you when the g starts going...
I've got to start this thing automatic - manually, if you don't give it to me, Jim.
Okay.
...so be sure you call it.
At 0.05g time, right?
Yes. God, it is hazy out there, isn't it? That's a different lighting effect. I think.
That's sunrise.
Huh?
Yes, that's the Sun...
Oh, here we go.
146:46:20; we should have 0.05g's.
That's the airglow we are starting to get; that's what it is, gentlemen.
Yes.
One - okay, we got the...
God damn, this is going to be a real ride; hang on.
[Garble].
I've never seen it this bright before.
Yes. Like you were going...
You got 0.05g yet?
...0.02, stand by; 38, 39, 40, 41
0.05g!
0.05g!
Okay, we got it!
Put the EMS, On.
Hang on!
0.05g switch, On.
0.05g Roll to EMS.
Right. Okay, gang.
They're building up.
Call out the g's.
We're 1 g.
Ohhh!
Okay
5!
6!
4!
She's doing a great job.
Vcircular at 48:23.
Vcircular
Cabin temperature is still holding real good.
VI's still high. Okay, we're [Program] 67.
Good point, too. [Long pause.]
Quite a ride, huh?
Damndest thing I ever saw.
Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. [Long pause.]
Gemini was never like that, was it, Jim?
No, it was a little faster than this one.
I assure you I've never seen anything like it.
Cabin temperature's holding real good - up 1 degree.
Primary evaporator's crapped out; secondary's still working.
Apollo 8, Houston through Huntsville. Over.
Coming up at 2g's.
Temperature's coming up in the primary loop okay.
Houston, Huntsville. We have not established contact with the spacecraft at this time.
Nice job there, gang.
Roger. Thank you, Huntsville.
Drogues at - You got then there? 8:16.
That's 58:16?
No, that's not right. 54 ...right.
It's a real glow. I can see our gegenschein.
Second pulse coming up.
[Cough.]
Huntsville, AOS through S-band. [Pause.] Houston, Huntsville. Stand by. No contact.
How much will this one go up, do you think?
3!
Roger.
Okay, we should have comm.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, this is Houston through ARIA.
Give them a call.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
[Garble.]
Say again, 8. [Pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, Apollo 8. Read you broken and loud.
Roger; this is a real fireball. It's looking good.
Come on, John Glenn.
Outstanding! [Long pause.]
Don't let me forget those - boost entry.
Roger; I got you.
Okay.
It's almost all over but the shouting now, men.
We're in real good shape, Houston.
Real fine. [Long pause.]
I think he's going to take Paul Haney's job. [Laughter.]
[Laughter.] My mother was worried.
A little smell in here.
Don't go to boost entry yet.
Apollo 8, Houston. Yorktown has radar on you.
Alright, I'm in boost entry.
Okay.
How's it look...
Looking good.
Is it holding? Cabin pressure?
Yes, it's holding.
Alright. Watch your altimeter, that's going to come up in a hurry here.
Okay
I'll - I'll give you warning on the steam pressure, if I can see it.
2 g's.
54:29 should be...
Looks like we're overshooting, according to the EMS.
Yes.
Okay.
53.
Yeah, I'm getting steam pressure. Okay.
54:29.
We got steam pressure.
We do?
Okay.
Make sure your heels are locked.
We got a - we got a minute to drogues.
Okay, you're in boost entry?
Yep.
Okay, anything on the altimeter, yet?
Not yet.
Okay, we've got 15 seconds from where - from 90K [27,500 metres].
Okay.
Okay.
There she comes.
Okay, she's starting to come.
30 seconds from 90K [27,500 metres].
Apollo 8, Houston.
Stand by, Houston.
If you get a chance, we'd like to have your DSKY readings before drogues.
Stand by.
Before drogues?
Roger. DSKY's reading plus four balls 7, plus two balls 812, minus 16522.
40K [12,200 metres].
Coming up on 40K. You should be at 40K now.
We're at 40K.
We are.
Okay, my call 30K [9,150 metres].
I will.
30K [9,150 metres].
ELS.
ELS Logic, On
Right.
ELS, Auto.
Auto.
Stand by for RCS disable. Stand by on the apex cover.
Right.
There goes the apex cover; there go the drogues.
Okay.
20,000 [6,100 metres].
Cabin pressure's coming up.
19,000 [5,800 metres].
Stand by for 10K [3,050 metres].
Should be approaching 10K soon.
15 [thousand feet. 4,600 metres].
Wonder what that was?
Nothing.
Should be approaching 10K [3,050 metres]. Standby with the mains in 1 second.
You see it?
Can't see it.
It should reef pretty soon. [Means unreef - the mains come out reefed, and unreef in two phases.]
Can't see a thing.
Okay, you got them?
Yes.
Float Bag, three, circuit breakers Closed.
Closed.
VHF antennas, recovery; VHF AM, simplex.
Beacons going On. Get your light On.
It's On.
you got your - you got it, Jim.
Huh?
You got the call - give them a call.
Okay.
This is Apollo 8. Over.
Okay, standing by for the (RCS) dump.
Apollo 8. Airboss 1. Go ahead.
Roger, Air Force 1. We indicate 8,000 [2,440 metres]. We can't see the chutes, but we're going down very slow.
Roger, this is Airboss 1. You're sounding very good, very good. You have been reported on radar as, southwest of the ship about 25 [nautical] miles [46 km]. Go ahead.
Roger. We are now indicating 7,000 [2,130 metres].
Ask him if he sees our beacon.
Airboss, do you see our flashing beacon?
This is Airboss 1. Negative. Welcome home, gentlemen, and we'll have you aboard in no time. Go ahead.
Stand by for the dump, Frank.
Alright.
Recovery 2, sever contact 260
Okay, ready for the dump, Frank?
Ready.
Cabin Pressure Relief valves, both, Closed.
Got that.
...my position at...
Direct O2, Open.
...09548.
Open.
CM RCS Logic, On.
On.
Command Module Propellant, Dump.
Recovery 2, Airboss 2. You are cleared to dispatch for your altitude over clouds. Over.
Roger this Is Recovery 2. I see the chutes, I see the light almost directly over Yorktown, level with me at 4,000 feet [1,220 metres] precisely.
Stand by. Stand by for Earth landing!
All aircraft, this is Yorktown - have capsule in sight. Out.
Okay! Purge. Purge it.
We're purging.
Purge complete?
Yorktown, this is Airboss 1. We consider recovery splashdown in your area. Take control recovery helos and vector them.
Floodlights to Postlanding.
This is Yorktown. Roger, out.
Cabin Pressure Relief valves, [garble].
[Garble]. Yorktown.
Dump - purge the cabin at 3,000 feet [900 metres].
CM RCS propellant, both. Off.
Rotational Control Power Direct, Off.
Direct, Off
This is Yorktown. Affirmative, we do have him in - capsule in sight. Out.
Turn him down. Christ, we can't get anything done.
Alright, Direct is Off.
... is Recovery 2. Passing 1,000 feet [300 metres].
Okay...
What's that?
Cabin dump.
...okay cabin dump. Okay, hold it.
Recovery 3, Yorktown. The capsule bears 147; 5,000 yards [4.6 km]. Yorktown, over.
[Garble] Off.
Alright, anything else we missed?
Roger.
Negative; just stand by to release the mains.
Yes.
Stand by for the Main Bus ties.
Brace yourselves.
Well, wait; we've got 2,000 feet [600 metres], yet.
I don't know if we have or not. They - reporting us as lower.
Oh, they were?
Who was worried about getting hot?
Only because I cooled you down.
The spacecraft is down to 1,000 [300 metres].
Recovery 2 is at level 1,000.
Re ready for code 3.
1,500 [450 metres].
Roger, 2. This is [garble] 3.
He called it 1,000. Maybe we better get these...
Recovery 2, descending through cherubs 5.
Okay, Frank, you put them Close whenever you want. I'm turning the Main Bus ties Off now.
Recovery 1, this in Airboss...
Yorktown, Rec 3. At this time, the Command Module is in the water. Over.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Recovery 3 reports splashdown time was 51 and 50 seconds, and rescue is underway.
