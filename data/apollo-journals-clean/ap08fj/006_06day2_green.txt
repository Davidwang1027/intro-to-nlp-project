Houston. How do you read, Apollo 8?
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
How do you read?
Reading you loud and clear, Frank. Good morning. How are you doing?
Hi Michael. We just broke lock for a minute, and I wondered why.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Your break lock is due to the fact we switched our antennas over from Honeysuckle to Madrid. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. We'd like to bring you up to date on your trajectory. This midcourse coming up at 28 hours GET turns out to be very small, 0.7 feet per second, and we would like not to do it. Our data is looking extremely good and extrapolating it forward, it shows that the midcourse number 4 at LOI minus 8 hours would be about 4 feet per second. In the meantime, the free return trajectory is looking very good with a water splash point off the coast of Africa. So it looks like you're right down the old center line, and we propose not to do the next midcourse. Over.
Fine with us.
Okay. And in regard to your timeline here, we suggest that you let Bill and Jim sleep for an extra period of time and don't wake them up until 26:30 GET, and that would cause deletion of P52 and P23 at 26 hours GET. Over.
Roger. Understand. Delete the P52 and P23.
Affirmative. Delete those at 26 hours, wake the other two guys up at 26:30 at which time they can eat, and then chlorinate the water supply after they have eaten.
Rog.
This would put us back on our nominal Flight Plan at 28 hours GET. Over.
Roger.
How's all that grab you?
Fine.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston, Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, we're switching antennas again at 23:40 GET. You can expect a momentary break lock, and also we'd like to bring you up to date on the Passive Thermal Control. We expect to keep the same PTC attitude until 28 hours GET. Over.
Fine; thank you. How is the thermal control working?
Working good, Frank. I can give you some details if you want them.
Go ahead.
I am all ears, Houston. Go ahead with the details.
Okay. Stand by one until we switch our antennas, Frank. We'll be right with you.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
On your PTC, quads A, C, and D seem to be just about identical. Quad B is running slightly cooler, but only very slightly so. The temperature read-outs in all respects are normal, so apparently the PTC is working well from a thermal viewpoint. And as far as the fuel consumption goes, it's minimal, just about like we expected. Have you got any comments about PTC? How does it seem to you?
Seems fine. Seems to be working all right, just like you said. I was just wondering how the readouts on the SPS were, too.
Apollo 8, Houston. The SPS temperature is normal. If anything, it's slightly warmer than we expected, so you're in real good shape in that respect.
Thank you.
Frank, the PU valve temperature is running about 72 degrees, which is better control than we got here in this room.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. It is time to do a cryo fan cycle, Frank, on all four fans; a short burst from each of them as you did before.
Understand. 2 minutes each on all cryo fans.
Right.
Cryo fans, Off, and cycled, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead. Over.
I said the cryo fans are Off, and completed the cycle.
Okay. Thank you, Frank.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Rog. Just a comm check, Frank. Do you read me alright?
Loud and clear.
Same here.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Go.
How've you been reading our tape dumps?
Stand by one, Frank. We noticed that you've got your PTC attitude tweaked up a bit, and I'll check on your tape dump.
Apollo 8, Houston. The quality of the tape dumps has been very good. We have about 15 minutes to dump, which we'll do the next time we get High Gain. Over.
How's the voice quality been?
It's been very good, Frank.
Okay. We'll send you something down here shortly.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Frank, on this tape recorder, we have the tape motion stopped right now. If you would like to record some, we'll give you a - the tape in motion so that you may do so. Is that what you would like? Over.
Roger. Houston, why don't you just give us salvo so we can control the switches here.
Okay. Stand by.
PCM Low and Stop.
You should have it now. Over.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Are you capable of taking a high-bit FM dump for voice on the Omnis?
That's negative, Bill. Not quite, on the Omnis.
Okay. We'll catch you next time around then.
Roger. Thank you.
Morning, Mike. How are things going down there?
Hi, Jim. Things are going real fine. How're you going up there? Did you get a good night's sleep?
Oh, you know. The first night in space all the time; it's a little slow.
The old man woke you up earlier than he needed to.
Well, we just couldn't sleep any longer.
Rog. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. The next time you're locked up on the High Gain, give us a call, and we're configuring for a dump. Over.
Roger. We would like an evaluation of the voice comments. Over.
Roger. Understand. So far, it's been very good. We will evaluate this one as soon as we can.
How are the systems looking down there, Houston?
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. I've been in the sack. How do the systems look?
Everything's looking real good, Bill.
Okay. How much longer do you expect on charging battery A?
Stand by, Bill. We will get you an exact number on it.
Just a rough estimate. And also, have you seen any more hints of that sensor problem on fuel cell 2?
Stand by one. I'll get the latest scoop on it for you, Bill.
Bill, there's nothing new on fuel cell number 2. We don't think there's anything at all wrong with the fuel cell. It's some sort of a sensor problem, but we don't have any new information on it.
Okay. They all look pretty good from here, Mike.
Rog. Thank you.
I've got some updates for you whenever you are ready to copy.
Stand by.
Okay.
What kind?
Well, I've got a TLI plus 35-hour update, and then I have an update to Jim's checklist.
Let's have the TLI plus 30 before we get the checklist update.
They never give up on the checklist, do they?
Okay. This - when you get your maneuver PAD book out, the last maneuver PAD we gave you for the flyby PAD still remains valid. We'd just like to remark that the entry angle, the Gamma, is slightly steeper than we consider ideal, but it's within our - sort of the noise level of our ability to predict at this time. So that flyby maneuver PAD remains valid. Over.
Roger, Houston.
Okay. Now on that page with the flyby maneuver, under your north set of stars, I have some new numbers for you because we've changed those stars from Navi and Polaris. As you recall, we changed to Sirius and Rigel, so - And that also, by the way, is the checklist update which I'll give you later - but on that maneuver PAD, I have got three new angles for you using Sirius and Rigel when you're ready to copy those.
Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read? Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Houston. Apollo 8. Over.
Roger, Apollo 8. Houston. You're loud and clear now. We had a lot of background noise there for a few minutes. How're you reading me?
Roger. I'm reading you okay, Mike, and I read you the last time you asked me that, so I guess maybe I wasn't getting through to you.
Okay. Well, did you copy on this flyby maneuver PAD? We've got three new angles. Are you ready to copy those?
I'm ready to copy the flyby angles.
Okay. Roll, 137; pitch, 310; yaw, 340. Over.
Roger. Roll, 137; pitch, 310; yaw, 340.
That's affirmative, and I have the TLI plus 35-hour PAD when you are ready for it.
Roger. Ready for the TLI plus 35.
Roger. TLI plus 35 hours: SPS/G&N; 63023; minus 1.62, plus 1.29. Are you with me so far?
Loud and clear.
Good. 037:56:51.38; plus 0006.8, plus 0000.0, plus 4642.0; 178, 134, 001; not applicable, plus 0020.2; 4642.0, 5:47, 4621.1. Are you with me? Over.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Good. 12, 138.3, 32.7; 023, up 17.2, left 2.2; plus 12.93, minus 165.00; 1290.5, 36180, 074:11:16. Comments: on your stars, Sirius and Rigel; roll, 010; pitch, 294; yaw, 320; no ullage. Other: one, fast return P37, Delta-V equals 7821, for mid-Pacific landing for MTL; two, high speed procedures not required. Over.
Alright. Are you ready for the readback?
All set.
TLI plus 35, SPS/G&N; 63023; minus 1.62, plus 1.29; 037:56:51.38; plus 0006.8, plus 0000.0, plus 4642.0; 178, 134, 000; N/A. Are you with me?
Yeah, I'm with you, Bill. That last one should be 001.
Roger. Y, 001; N/A, plus 0020.2; 4642.0, 5:47, 4621.1; 12, 138.3, 32.7; 023, up 17.2, left 2.2; plus 12.93, minus 165.00; plus 1290.5, plus 36180, 074:11:16. Sirius, Rigel; 010, 294, 320; no ullage, fast return P37, 7821 mid-PAC; high speed not required. Over.
That's about the size of it. You're getting pretty good at this thing, Bill, for a rookie.
Not bad. I just learned to read about a year ago.
Roger. Hey, I've got a Flight Plan update for Jim. It's on page G, George, 82 Able of his checklist. Over.
Roger. I've got it open. Go ahead, Mike.
Okay. It's simply changing these north set of stars around. For Navi substitute Sirius, which is number 15, and for Rigel - correction - for Polaris substitute Rigel, number 12.
Roger. Substituting Rigel for Polaris and Sirius for Navi. How about shaft and trunnion; remain the same?
Your shaft and trunnion s remain the same. Sirius remains on the 50° line just like Navi used to be. Rigel is down 1.3° from your horizontal, from your M-line. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Okay. And let me know when it gets to be breakfast time. I've got a newspaper to read up to you and a few other things.
We're ready.
Okay. I've got a Haney special here for you. The Interstellar Times latest edition says the flight to the Moon is occupying prime space on both paper and television; It's THE news story. The headlines of the Post says "Moon, here they come." We understand that Bill Anders will be in private conversation or communication today with an old man who wears a red suit and lives at the North Pole. A suspect in the Miami kidnapping was captured late yesterday, and the 11 GI's that have been detained 5 months in Cambodia were released yesterday and will make it home in time for Christmas.
Roger. With reference to the first, we saw him earlier this morning, and he was heading your way.
Roger. We'll pass the word along. David Eisenhower and Julie Nixon were married yesterday in New York. He was described as "nervous".
Right.
The Browns took Dallas apart yesterday 31 to 20. We're sort of curious, who do you like today, Baltimore or Minnesota? Over.
Baltimore.
How many points are you giving?
He's not making many points at home with that comment.
Rog. Understand. Oh, I've got another - another score for you when you're ready to copy. Are you ready to copy?
Stand by. Go ahead.
Roger. Navy 14, Army 21. Would you like for me to repeat that? Over.
You are very garbled; Houston; I'm unable to read. Will call you back in another year.
Okay. We also notice the University of Houston lost their first home basketball game in 3½ years last night. Illinois edged them out 97 to 84. And some really big news: the State Department announced only a few minutes ago that the Pueblo crew will be released at 9 pm tonight.
Sounds good. Outboard calculations indicate that Apollo 8, at 25 hours, is 104,000 miles from home.
Yeah. Our plot board shows a similar number.
Mighty nice view from here.
We're showing about 104,800 miles, and we're guessing another 8 to 10 hours on your battery charge.
Okay.
Frank, say again about the view. You were blocked, I think.
It's a mighty nice view we have down there today. A little bit more than a half-Earth. Looks like Africa and the Red Sea is visible; we're not quite sure as there is quite a bit of cloud cover; but even through the hazy windows, it's mighty nice.
How are your windows? Do you have a couple left that are real clear?
The rendezvous windows are good. The others are all about the same as they were when we last reported. One and five have a slight haze and a little fog on the inside.
Rog. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger. Just as a matter of curiosity for Bill, we can say a few words about the heaters for the cryo tanks, and also for the fans. We've noticed that the heaters are doing their thing normally, cycling on and off; and as time goes by, the - this cycle rate increases, indicating a little bit of stratification in the tanks. And then when we've been turning the fans on every 4 hours for a couple of minutes, this stirs things up and the heaters then cycle on and off again more slowly for a while, until again a little bit of stratification occurs, and the cycling becomes slightly more rapid. This is, of course, normal; we just point it out as a curiosity to you. Over.
Rog. I haven't really been following it that close. One thing I have noticed is when you turn the fans on you get a glitch in the quantity, which might correspond to a glitch in AC. Maybe the next time we'll look at the AC volts and see what happens.
Our experts say that's not the reason for the glitch. They say the stratification fakes out the capacitance sensor there for a second.
I knew they would have some big deal answer for me.
First gotcha today.
I'll buy that. Rog.
Any other information you want us to send up to you?
No, we're going to zap you with the High Gain here shortly.
Okay.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. How do you read on the High Gain?
Reading you loud and clear, Bill. How me?
I'm reading you loud and clear. I'll go ahead and dump this. You might want to listen to it in real time to evaluate the voice.
Okay. We'll do that as soon as we can.
Give me a call when you're ready.
Do you want to dump it by your command, or would you like us to command the dump, On? Over.
Oh, you can go ahead and command whenever you're ready.
Okay. We are starting now; thank you.
I've already rewound.
Roger.
Rog. I've already rewound.
There's only about 5 minutes worth on the tape, Houston.
Rog. Understand, Bill. You promised me you'd wait 3 days before you started doing this, Bill.
It's been a long trip.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Bill. We've got your dump, and the voice quality is very good. We're going to take about 20 minutes or so to get it back to Houston to play it.
Roger. Where are you taking it through, Houston?
It comes through Madrid and then Ascension, Bill.
Okay.
Apollo 8. Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Roger, Bill. We're reading you loud and clear now. We had an antenna problem down here. We had an unexpected switch of antennas, which probably caused your High Gain to quit.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Jim. When we lost our antenna down here, we interrupted your tape dump, so we are in the process of doing some rewinding and continuing the dump, in case Bill is wondering what's going on with the tape recorder.
Okay. No strain.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. At 26 hours GET, we'll be switching our antennas back again at Madrid, and you can expect a glitch on your comm system.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Jim.
I noticed that you skipped the IMU alignment for about 26 hours because we were still asleep. Do you want to include that again, or do you think it is required?
Roger, Jim. We think it's going to be required prior to the next set of P23 sightings, and we're suggesting that it be put in at 27:45. We'll have a Flight Plan - a more complete Flight Plan update in here shortly.
Okay. Fine. We're in the process of having breakfast.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
The tape dumps are complete; it's rewound. You can go ahead and record in low bit rate if you so desire.
Roger. Will do.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.
Disregard. We were going to talk about the High Gain, but you beat us to it.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Rog, Jim. We would like to take control of the tape for a few minutes to make sure that we got all that last dump. Over.
Okay. Stand by one.
Roger.
You've got it.
Thank you, sir.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. I just noticed that I can hear those RTC's coming through on normal voice.
What does it sound like, Bill?
A little squeak.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. I have a Flight Plan update for you sometime at your convenience.
Alright.
Ready to copy.
Apollo 8, Houston. Were you calling? Over.
Roger. Ready to copy.
Okay, Bill. This will be on page 2-22 of your Flight Plan. And for the Command Module Pilot - I've already mentioned it to him - but at the top of the page, at about 27:45, actually, we would like him to do a P52, an IMU alignment, and then the P23 should be done as scheduled. Those four stars, Procyon, Regulus, Alphard, and Spica: we realize Alphard may not be too good a star, Regulus is about 3° above the horizon, and Spica is at a 48° trunnion angle; so I guess what we are saying is if Jim has difficulty doing one set on each of those four stars, we suggest that he omit whichever one he is having difficulty with and pick it up by doing two sets on some other star that he likes. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Alright. In the lower right hand corner of page 2-22, the Passive Thermal Control attitude should read "pitch, 224°; yaw, 020°."
Roger. Copy.
And on the next page, at about 29 hours, you can resume the normal Flight Plan. We would like to make one addition; at 29:30, add a waste water dump. Even though one is not really required at that time, we would like to get the dump out of the way so we can track you uninterruptedly without any dumping, you know, as we are coming up on midcourse correction number 3. Over.
Roger.
That's about all, Bill. You got any questions on this?
No. It looks pretty good. We've been saving up some water of our own to dump here, so that will work out all right.
Very good. And don't ruin Jim's optics.
Right.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go.
Roger. We'd like P00 and Accept, please. We'd like to send you up a P27. It's a LM state vector, going to the LM slot only, and we do not want you to transfer it over to the CSM.
Apollo 8. Houston. Did you copy?
Roger. You got it.
Okay. We got it. We're sending you a LM state vector, and we would like you not to transfer that vector over to the CSM slot.
Roger.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8. Roger. Are you still planning an MCC-2 at 28 hours? Over.
Stand by one, Bill. Bill, negative. No, that midcourse correction number 2 has been cancelled. It's magnitude was less than 1 foot per second, so we decided not to do it. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
And you've got the computer again, if you go to Block.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Are you still computing the pericynthion time of 69:10?
Stand by. We will get an update for you.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Your 69:10 pericynthion is still good plus or minus a minute, and we'll get it down to a fine map measurement.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger. This is Apollo 8.
Okay, Bill. We just got your read-out on your voice tape, and we will be back with you shortly on it. Over.
Okay.
Houston, I'm going to be doing my alignment at this time. I'm in a good position for viewing the stars.
Roger, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston with a voice check. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. Reading you loud and clear now. How us?
Oh, good. Reading you loud and clear. One, two, three, four, five, five, four, three, two, one. Am I cutting in and out still? Over.
Nope. All the numbers are coming up nicely.
Okay. Thank you, Jim.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're going to switch antennas at 28:20. Stand by for a blitz.
Roger, Houston. And we have stopped Passive Thermal Control and we're maneuvering to P23.
Roger. Understand; maneuvering to P23; I understand.
Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. You copying high bit rate now for this P23?
Negative, Bill. We're getting low bit rate now.
If you go high bit rate, we won't bother recording it.
Roger. We just went to high bit rate.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Cislunar Nav accomplished. We did two sets on star 16, two sets on 22, and one set on 21.
Roger. Understand P23 completed, two sets on 16, two on 22, and one on 21.
Roger. It was getting a little late, so we didn't want to start on 26.
Roger. Understand, Jim.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Is our previous PTC attitude okay for the next session?
Roger, Bill. The one that we updated an hour or so ago, i.e., pitch, 224; yaw, 020, is a good one.
224, 20. Roger.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We'll be changing antennas in about 2 minutes. You can expect a glitch in your comm.
Roger.
Roger.
How are all of the systems looking down there, Houston?
Apollo 8, Houston. You're looking good here in all respects.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Houston, Apollo 8.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Roger. Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. We're dumping some water we collected here, and we're ready to dump the waste water down to 25 percent. Do you concur?
Roger. We concur. We're standing by for your dump.
Alright. We've already started the other.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. This is Apollo 8.
Roger. We're getting geared up down here to do the first of the comm checks. We will be doing an Omni comm check, which is on your Flight Plan, listed mode 7.8, and we'll let you know when we are ready to proceed.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger, Houston. We're dumping waste water now. How do the nozzle temps look?
Stand by. Looks good, Bill; 64 degrees. Over.
Roger. We just got an O2 flow high from purging to vent line on the cabin.
Roger. Understand.
How is everything in Houston.
Oh, just fine, Frank. Everything down here is Go. How are you?
Fine. What's the news?
Well, did you get the intergalactic news summary we sent up to you a couple of hours ago? It might have been during your rest period. We gave you a couple of football scores. One of them in particular was - I don't know if you copied that - Army 21, Navy 14. Over.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven; testing out.
I got that one.
Rog. The Cowboys were destroyed by the Cleveland Browns yesterday. The Pueblo crew is expected to be released. And I now hear our air-to-ground has got a lot of background noise. Stand by; we are going to go through these comm test modes on page 2-23 of the Flight Plan. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Would you go S-band Aux switch to Down-Voice Backup. Over.
Down-Voice Backup. Roger and out.
Thank you.
Houston, be advised that it looks like your Quindars are clipping your voice during your transmission.
Roger, Understand. Are we still experiencing this intermittent condition that was there a few minutes ago?
Not always, but often in the beginning and in the end or your transmission.
Roger. Understand. I'll give it a little extra time.
Go.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Could you try to find us a better Omni antenna? Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're not able to read you on this Omni antenna. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. We understand you're copying us. While we are trying to reestablish contact with you, would you put your optics switch to zero? We show you're drifting off in trunnion and request that you zero your optics.
Apollo 8, Houston. We copy your optics zeroed, and how are you reading us now? Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're down to 25 percent on your waste water dump and ready to terminate. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Our next comm test is a ranging only test. I have four switches I'd like you to throw, which will cause you to lose voice communications for approximately 3 minutes. Over.
Roger. Go ahead.
Alright. The first one is S-band Normal, Mode, Voice, Off; the second, S-band Normal, Mode, PCM, Off; the third, S-band Normal, Mode, Ranging, switch to Ranging; and fourth, the S-band Aux tape switch, Off. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Request S-band Normal, Mode Ranging to Off, and S-band Normal, Mode, PCM, to PCM. I say again, S-band Normal, Mode, Ranging, Off; S-band Normal, Mode, PCM, to PCM.
Apollo 8. Houston. We'll stand by in this configuration for a moment.
Apollo 8, Houston. Three communication switch positions. First, S-band, Aux, Tape, to Down-Voice Backup; S-band Normal, Mode, PCM, Off; Telemetry Inputs PCM, High. I say again, S-band, Aux, Tape, to Down-Voice Backup; S-band Normal, Mode, PCM to Off; Telemetry Inputs PCM to High.
Roger. Houston, this is Apollo 8. How do you read?
Reading you weak but clear now, Bill.
Roger. We still have a bad look angle on this antenna.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Please be informed that the. Over.
Apollo 8. Houston. Unable to copy. After about a minute of this configuration, we're going to return to normal voice, and at that time, we should be able to hear you better.
Roger. What are we going through right now?
Roger. We are in Mode 7-10, and the comm test mode's on page 223. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Three switch positions. Telemetry Inputs PCM switch to Low; S-band Normal, Mode, Voice, to Voice; S-band Normal, Mode, PCM, to PCM. I say again, Telemetry Inputs PCM switch, Low; S-band Normal, Mode, Voice, to Voice; S-band Normal, Mode, PCM, to PCM. Over.
Roger. We're switching over to backup now.
Reading you very weak.
We're reading you loud and clear, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Requesting S-band Normal, Mode, Ranging, to Ranging. I say again, S-band Normal, Mode, Ranging to Range. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Requesting S-band Normal, Mode, Ranging to Ranging. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Houston, Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Beautiful, Frank. I'm reading you loud and clear. How me?
Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read? Over.
Apollo 8. this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Reading you loud and clear. How me?
You're loud and clear, Michael.
Okay. We're still looking for the S-band, Normal, Mode, Ranging to Ranging.
I guess we didn't hear that one. Going to Ranging.
Roger.
It's in Ranging now.
Thank you.
And Houston, Apollo 8. What size antenna are you going through now?
Apollo 8, Houston. We're working through Ascension, a 30-footer. Over.
Okay. 'Cause we - our signal strength is - or our AGC is pretty low up here.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. Requesting S-band Aux, Tape to Off. This should put us back in the normal configuration. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. S-band Aux, Tape to Off. That returns us to normal configuration, and we need a couple of items from you. First, the CMP and LMP status report, including PRD readings on all three crew members, and we'd like to know, did you chlorinate the water after your last meal? Over.
No, we haven't chlorinated the water, yet. We'll get the other for you.
Roger. Thank you.
Houston, do you show our FM - Houston, Apollo 8. Do you show the FM on now?
Stand by and we'll check it, Bill.
Because our S-band Aux, Tape has been Off. Possibly - we don't have control of it.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're showing all the communications switch functions operating normally, Bill.
Okay, Mike. Thanks.
Mike, the PRD readings for the CDR are 4 - 0.04, for the CMP is 0.64, and for the LMP is 0.25.
Roger. I copy 0.04, 0.64, 0.25. Thank you.
Rog.
