Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We're at that attitude right now. I'm looking through the scanning telescope. I can barely see any stars at all, and every time that the thruster will fire, you know, just completely blanks out my vision.
Roger, 8. Understand. [Pause.]
Now the attitude is good, Houston, as far as not having glare in the optics, and it might be a certain amount of dark adaptation is required here. [Pause.]
8, Houston. Roger. Copy.
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Houston, Goddard Voice. Negative Quindar keys.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. I've got a new PTC attitude for you when you finish P23. Give you a better look at the Earth. Over.
Roger. Ready to copy.
Okay. Pitch, 224; yaw, 20.
New PTC is pitch, 224; yaw, 20.
Affirm.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go. [Long pause.]
Houston Comm Tech, Honeysung - Honeysuckle. Negative Quindar keying.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. We're taking our time going to this new P23 attitude; going to Navi is quite a ways away from the attitude we need for P23. I have a correction to make on 20 - on Navi, after getting dark adapted; you can pick out Cassiopeia and you can pick out Navi itself. It's difficult to see what stars are around. We still have quite a bit of particles that are floating with the spacecraft, especially when we move the optics and shaft. It seems to throw off a lot of particles.
Roger. We copy that. What's your spacecraft lighting situation inside now?
We have the center window - the round window covered, and we have - the other windows are open.
Roger, 8. Copy.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. While you're maneuvering for your P23, we have an update for Delta-H for you if you're ready to copy. [Pause.]
Roger. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Roger, Houston. You say you have a Delta-H update for us? Just what do you mean?
Roger. Delta-Horizon update.
Roger. Go ahead.
This is as a result of your P23 calibration; the update follows: Verb 24, Noun 01, Enter 1354, Enter, all balls, Enter, 21450, Enter; comments: continue to mark on the horizon definition that you've used previously. Your marks are looking very good.
Roger. Delta-H update as follows: Verb 24, Noun 01, Enter, 1354, Enter, all zeros, Enter, 21450, Enter. Understand those are two octal numbers.
That's affirmative; both octal.
Roger. When do we get the maneuvers here? I'll go out of [P]23, and I'll put these in; then I'll continue.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. There's no requirement for you to leave P23; you can enter those right now if you want to.
Roger.
Houston, are we in low bit rate now?
Apollo 8, Houston. You're in high bit rate.
Roger. We'd like to record you this P23 stuff.
Okay. [Pause.]
How about commanding low bit rate, Record, Forward.
Roger. Low bit rate, Record, Forward. [Long pause.]
Alright, Houston. Have you sent those commands yet?
Apollo 8, Houston. They have been sent.
Alright, Roger. Thank you. I'm on the other side, too lazy to go over and get it.
Apollo 8, Houston. We'd like to go back to high bit rate in order to get this P23 data recorded. Over. [Long pause.]
Our checklist says low bit rate, Houston. If you want high, you can have it.
Roger. We're going high bit rate.
Okay.
How's that, sports fans? All balls.
As soon as you've got an audience, you do great.
14640.
Time.
17:53:19.36, got it.
How many markings for this set is that?
There's three stars and three marks per set.
That's three for that second - that's the same star, second set, third set of marks. And then you've got...
Do I have six marks, total?
You got six marks, total. You need three more on this same star, right?
Yeah, okay. There's the third one, there.
Okay.
Okay, I got...
Okay, I go three?
Oh - you on hold?
Yeah.
18 and 3, huh?
Yeah.
74645.
Okay.
Okay. 17:55:38?
Right.
3.
3.
You in hold?
Hold.
8 and 1.
Right.
Got it.
74655.
Got it.
17:58:19.
Got it.
3.
3.
Oh, oh.
Three zeros, okay?
12662.
Right.
Okay.
It only went down 17. Wait a minute.
What's that?
It only went down 17 - 17, 18, 00, 23, 00. Okay?
Okay.
Now I get this.
Proceed.
Okay, new star?
New star, number 22.
Okay, what is it, 22, star - what's the code after it?
It doesn't say.
Yeah, 00120 - 1, 2, 0.
Which way are you going to be going? Far horizon?
Yeah, it'll be at the same horizon.
Too close to gimbal lock?
Yeah, 03. It won't be a far move, though. 21 plus 22, Enter; proceed; that should be a zero.
Auto?
Let's... No, why don't you Proceed? Let's see where it's going to take it.
Okay, we're - Pitch 123, yaw 305 - Oh, we're getting right under it [probably means the gimbal-lock region].
Yes. All set?
Okay, CMC and Auto [settings required before an automaneuver].
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, we're there.
Okay. How's that? [Garble] zero off.
70645.
What was that, again?
70645. Trunnion?
Okay
18:04:34.72. [Garble] with something right, here.
I got 03. Okay?
Yeah.
3.
3.
18 was... Go ahead.
1898, trunnion.
What - what the other [garble]. Is this the third one or the fourth one?
The third one was - 31...
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Do you want us to turn off your DSE for you? It's probably about half full. We're getting good high bit rate down.
Do you want to get the rest of this data?
We're getting good high bit rate down.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. And, also, we're - your state vector is now based on about 5 hours of tracking. We have you on a pericynthion of 69.7 miles with a free return. Your entry flight path angle looks like about minus 14. You will need only a few feet per second to get you back on a nominal entry angle. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Did you get the words on the state vector? [Long pause.]
Houston, did you read? Apollo 8. We got a lot of noise.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead. [Long pause.]
Are we in...
We're in hold, you want to go.... What you want, Auto?
No, no, just [garble].
Houston, Apollo 8.
[Garble.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Go. [Pause.]
Roger; we lost you when you started talking about the....
Apollo 8, this is Houston reading you fairly weak. I'll repeat the state vector information. Your state vector is now based on 5 hours of - more than 5 hours of tracking. We show you on a pericynthion of 69.7 [nautical] miles with a free return with an entry path flight angle of minus 14 degrees. Will only need a few feet per second at the lunar distance to get you back on a nominal entry angle. Over.
Roger. Copy.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go. Reading you weak, but clear.
Roger. Our sighting schedule is complete, and I'm maneuvering to PTC attitude.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. I'm at the PTC maneuver now. I'd like a systems status from you; how do the batteries looks and how the fuel cells look and et cetera. Over.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We figure battery B will be charged in about 2 to 3 hours. All your systems look Go; your RCS usage so far is about 60 pounds [27 kg], six-zero pounds over nominal. Over.
Roger. How about fuel cell 2; is that looking all right now?
Roger. Fuel cells are all looking good.
Okay. We're going to have two of us hit the hay now and one man minding the store so you might have everybody keep an extra sharp eye on [garble].
Roger, Bill. You think you'll going to be able to sleep okay?
Yeah. I think we kinda warmed up to a good sleep here by now.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Onboard navigation indicates a pericynthion altitude of 38.4 [nautical] miles [71.1 km].
Understand; 38.4 miles.
That's affirmative. It's on the DSKY right now, if you're reading it out.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Be advised your downlink now is getting very noisy.
Apollo 8, this is Houston with some comments on navigation.
Go ahead, Houston.
Good morning, Frank. Apollo 8, this is Houston. We're wondering about your GDC backup align; we'd like your opinion on the possibility of doing this align using Sirius and Rigel rather than Navi, as it's in the north set at this time. Over. [Pause.]
Stand by one.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is Apollo 8. We concur. Sirius and Rigel would be two stars that would be much better than Navi and Polaris. However, I did Cassiopeia after I became [dark-]adapted, but I'm afraid that the time required to do that type of alignment would be extensive if we ever had to go to that alignment.
Roger, Jim. We understand. We'll go ahead and work in that direction, and we'll quit bothering you. Good night.
Apollo 8, this is Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. At 19 [hours] GET, we're due for another cycle through on the cryo fans. Over.
Roger.
Roger. Give us a call when you're complete.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Why don't you give me a call when it is time to quit charging the battery, will you? I can't watch it very well over there.
Wilco. [Pause.]
And I'm starting with the fans now.
Roger. Copy.
Hy - hydrogen [tank] 1 first.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. We cycled through the fans, 2 minutes each, and we'll stand by for the call for battery charges.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. The battery charge will be complete around 21 hours.
Okay. Just give me a call.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Hello Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Go. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. Go. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead. [No answer.]
Houston. Apollo 8. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Go ahead. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger, Houston. Crew status report here. We're behind on water - behind on water and food, and we don't seem to have too much of an appetite. We're trying to stay up with the water, but the food is - not that there's anything wrong with the food, but we're just not very hungry.
Rog. Understand, Frank.
The CDR got 5 hours of fitful sleep and rest, and the other two people are trying to sleep now.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston at 21 hours. We'd like you to terminate the battery B charge and start battery A charge and then begin an O2 purge. Over.
Roger. Understand; terminate battery B, start battery A, and an O2 purge.
Roger. O2 fuel cell purge.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. We're now charging battery A, and say again about the purge. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Copy your battery charge setup; now begin a fuel cell O2 purge. Over.
Fuel cell O2 purge. Roger.
Houston, the fuel cells are all purged. [Pause.]
Roger, Frank. [Pause.]
How's the tracking coming, Jerry? [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8. Houston.
How's the tracking looking?
It's looking good, Frank. We just took in another batch of data, and we're processing it. It looks initially like we won't even need a midcourse number 2. As soon as we process this data, we will have some confirmation for you. It should take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes to finish the job.
Thank you.
Apollo 8. Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We're showing your pericynthion 64 nautical miles. Your next mid-course at 28 [hours] will be less than 1 foot per second. We'll have a firm confirmation on this in about 2 hours.
Roger.
