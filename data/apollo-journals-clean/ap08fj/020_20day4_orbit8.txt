Have you - have you done any of the cryos?
Huh?
Is that thing running now?
Is that thing running already?
Huh? Did you put it on Off?
Here you go.
We're doing fine; why don't you go to bed? I'll [garble]. Just tell me what the click - just turn that thing? Look! This thing here? Right over your head?
No, I want you to get to bed. Come on now. You've been up all the time; it's in the Flight Plan. God damn it, go to bed! To hell with the other stuff! We'll bust our ass for it.
Do I just turn that when the time comes? What do I have to do to start it?
[Garble] eighth; it's going to start with me.
[Garble] stay 1 more minute.
I know it. Get going! I think this is a closed issue. Get to bed!
I don't care; get to bed!
No, you get to bed; get your ass to bed. You quit wasting one - one - I - I - I - I don't want to talk about it.
Shut up; go to sleep, both you guys.
I'll just click it on when the time comes.
You should see your eyes; get to bed!
Don't worry about the exposure business, Goddamn it, Anders; get to bed! Right now! Come on!
I don't want [garble] All right. You want me to take some pictures? Get some sleep now. You've only got a couple hours, Bill, before we're going to have to be fresh again.
Yeah. Okay. I'll take care of it all. All right. I just got up, remember? I slept for 4 hours.
No, I didn't.
[Garble].
Yeah. Go to sleep.
Houston already came back and said, "Fine."
Yeah.
A quick snooze, and you guys will feel a hell of a lot better tomorrow.
Well, you're tired; it's not cold.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, loud and clear.
Roger.
Fine, I'm fine.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Rog, Apollo 8. Couple of notes for you: on the P52 you're coming up to on this rev, we've looked at your state vectors and all your information. The platform looks good, and it appears that's your option if you'd like to bypass this P52; your platform will still be good at the following TEI pass. And we would like to have your PRD reading and I guess we're behind the sleep summary. Over.
Okay. Well, Jim and Bill are both resting now. I had just about 3 hours or 4 hours during the period earlier today.
Roger. Copy. [Pause.]
And this PRD now reads 144.
Copy, 144. And we have an update ready to go into your computer for the state vector if you want to go to P00 and Accept. [Pause.]
P00 and Accept.
Thank you.
[Garble] am standing by to copy the TEI-9 PAD. [Long pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8, we've completed with the computer, and you can use the Verb 47 to transfer and I have the TEI-9 PAD.
That's Ken, isn't it? Just a minute and I'll take care of it.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, I went to P00 and then Verb 47, and I'm ready to copy.
Okay. Do you have it in Block?
Say again.
I say, do you have the Up Telemetry in Block?
It's in Block.
Roger.
Okay. This PAD is a TEI-9; SPS/G&N; 45597; minus 0.40, plus 1.57, 087:19:18.20; plus 3418.8, minus 0135.3, plus 0078.0; 180, 008, 001; November Alpha, plus 0018.7; 3422.3, 3:13, 34021; 42, 089.8, 25.3; 033, down 13.1, left 2.8; plus 07.58, minus 165.00; 1298.7, 36277, 146:48:16; primary star, Sirius; secondary, Rigel; 129, 155, 010; 4 quads, 15-second ullage; horizon's on 1.2-degree window line at T minus 3; use the high speed procedure with minus Mike Alpha. After looking at the burn information from your previous SPS burns, it appears that our engine performance should give us a 3-second burn time longer than what you have on the PAD. The PAD number should correspond with what you get out of the computer. So we have not factored this into the past data; however, you can anticipate the engine for a normal Delta-V to give you a 3-second - 3.7-second burn in excess of the computed times. Over.
Roger. Thank you. [Pause.]
TEI-9; SPS/G&N; 45597; minus 0.40, plus 1.57; 087:19:18.20; plus 3418.8, minus 0135.3, plus 0078.0; 180, 008, 001; N/A, plus 0018.7; 3422.3, 3:13, 3402.1; 42, 089.8, 25.3; 033, down 13.1, left 2.8; plus 07.58, minus 165.00; 1298.7, plus - or 36277, 146:48:16; and that's Sirius and Rigel; 129, 155, 010; 4 jet, 15 seconds; 1.2-degrees on the window at T minus 3, high speed minus MA, engine 3.7 seconds longer than given.
That's affirmative, Apollo 8. And when you get around to it, if you'd like for us to dump your tape, we can do that when you get on the High Gain. [Pause.]
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay. Should have it on the High Gain now, Houston.
Roger. And we're going to go ahead and dump the tape.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Ken, will we get the real TEI PAD the next time around now? [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, we'll have one for you the next time around, and we'll update it if necessary on the following rev.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Do you have any idea why quad B seems so much lower in quantity than the other three quads?
Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. It looks to us like, although we're reading out the same thing you are on the quad quantities, using the computer program and all of the correction factors that are in there, it looks like all four of your quads are very close. In pounds, it looks like you have, for example. 193 pounds in quad A and 189 in B, 200 in C, and 190 in Delta. And the difference that you read on the gauge is attributed to the fact that you don't have all of the correction factors in there. This ground calculation has an accuracy of about plus or minus 6 percent and the best you can do onboard, even using your chart, is plus or minus 10 percent. Over.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. The tape recorder is back to you.
Thank you.
Hey, Bill, [garble] aspirin.
You got a headache?
Hey, you don't have to tell them about aspirin. I told Berry [garble]; just the other two.
Yes, you ought to be good and tired, too.
There's a magazine floating around. Can you grab that please, Jim?
Huh? It's for you to sleep.
Hey, this little radiometer that I got is up to 124 now. What's yours reading?
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, we've just finished looking at all your systems and all the trajectory information, and you have the Go for another rev.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Do what? Yes.
Understand we're Go for rev 9.
That's affirmative, 8.
I feel - I - Listen, I'll be the first to tell you I had enough sense; I went down and crapped out before.
How's the weather down there, Ken?
It's really beautiful; loud and clear, and just right in temperature.
How about the recovery area?
That's looking real good.
Very good.
Yeah. They tell us that there's a beautiful Moon out there.
Now, I was just saying that there's a beautiful Earth out there.
It depends on your point of view.
Yeah. [Long pause.]
Almost...
If you're looking for things to do up there, Frank, you might hit that biomed switch over to the left position.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Are you ready?
All set.
5, 4, 3 [hears Mattingly] - Say again.
We've got the computers waiting.
Ken, are you ready? 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Mark.
How do you read me on Omni A, Ken?
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
I'm reading you weak, but clear, Frank.
How about this antenna? Is that any better?
It's a little louder. [Pause.]
Okay.
[Whistling.
[Garbled.] align [garble]?
We didn't have to do one, Jim. No, they said that they'd checked it, and it looked real good, and they'd let you sleep.
Hey, Ken, how'd you pull a duty on Satur - on Christmas Eve? It always happens to bachelors every time, doesn't it?
I wouldn't be anywhere else tonight.
Ha, ha.
Ken, how's the MSFN tracking on this lunar orbit coming out? [Long pause.]
Okay. Frank, it's looking like it's coming right down the pike. It's doing just what it is supposed to, and apparently, all our computer programs have got the right numbers in them because they're predicting where you're going.
Have they covered any of these anomalies due to hard spots [mascons]?
Rog. They're detectable, but they're not changing things enough to be anything more than of interest.
Fine. Hope they are as good with the corridor as they were with that LOI. That was beautiful.
It sure was. That's - that is textbook all the way.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We're about - inside 10 minutes to LOS. We'll be picking you up again at 85:40, and we'll have all of the TV types information standing by. In the event that the situation develops again for pointing accuracies, if I see anything that looks like a terminator or anything of that nature, I'm going to call the dark side of it 12 o'clock, and use that as a reference system, and we'll try that. If that doesn't dope out any problems with camera pointing, why I may try - call for a plus pitch and then I'll just correct what I see to account for it.
Roger. We're not going to use that telephoto lens. I don't believe we'll be able to get a picture of the Earth. It's going to have to be the terminator, the lunar surface. I'm looking at the Earth right now; and we won't see it again during that period.
Okay. Real fine then. And next time around, why, we'll take an extra special look at all of the parameters; we'll have a TEI PAD for you. And we'll use the last rev for a real good hack on all the systems. I'll give you a run down by system of all things we see, and where they stand.
Okay, fine.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're approaching 4 minutes to LOS. All systems are Go.
Roger. Thank you.
