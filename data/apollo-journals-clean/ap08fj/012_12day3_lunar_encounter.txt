That was great, wasn't it? I wonder if they've turned it off.
[Laughing.] Chris probably said, "No matter what happens, turn it off.
Okay. My S-volume is down.

Hey, you know the one thing. The problem is we didn't go to trim.
Yeah, I said trim - it goes to trim...
Okay.
Or zero.
It's to trim!
It is? Okay.
Yeah.
On that horizon, boy, I can't see squat out there.
You want to turn off your lights to check it?
Hey, I got the Moon.
Do you?

All right, all right, come on. You're going to look at that for a long time.
20 hours, is that it?
Okay.
Coming up 07:45; DSKY should blank.

I'm proceeding on [Verb] 99.
DSKY blank.
Okay. Okay, average g, On; Flight Recorder's going to Record; EMS Mode, Auto.

Check PIPA bias.
No ullage required. Standing by for Engine On Enable. [Press] Proceed when you get it [that being Verb 99 on the DSKY].
Okay.
Start your watch when you get ignition.
Stand by for Delta-V, Normal, B.

1 second, 2 seconds; alright, how's every...
We got them. Pressure's holding good.
Alright. Everything's good over here, so far.
Everything is looking good.
15 seconds.
That's four ball valves; everything is great.
Okay.
Pressures are coming up nicely.
Alright.
Everything is great.
Be the longest 4...
Long burn.
She holding good?
Drifting a little bit in roll.
Good shape. PC check?

EMS is counting down.
Jesus, 4 minutes?
2 minutes [into the burn].
How's it doing, Bill?
Great shape. Pressures are holding. Helium's coming down nicely. All the systems are Go.
Okay.
We're past 2 minutes; we're in mode 30. Free area for flange Temp. Thing is looking good.
Longest 4 minutes I ever spent.
You know, it seems like about 3-g's.
3 minutes [into the burn].
Okay, you're running a little bit longer on the time on the computer. I got 58, 6, 5, Stand by.
We're looking good, Frank.

Verb 82, Enter. Check it at zero [Program 00, where the computer is not running a major program]; I'd better go to zero, now.
You want to put that in the other state vector, too, don't you?
Yeah.
Got it.
Congratulations, gentlemen, you're at 00.
Well, now is no time for congratulations yet.
No, we get stuck with that on the carrier. Okay, Verb 82, Enter.

Verb 66, Enter.
That's it. Dig out the Flight Plan.
Whew! Well, we answered it. They're meteorites, aren't they? (Laughter.)
Hey, I don't see a thing. Where are we?
It looks like a big - looks like a big beach down there.
Let me have the Flight Plan.
Holy cow, it's completely blank here.
Okay, Jim, you want to...
Have we got all the gimbal motors off and all that sort of thing?
Yes, sir.
You want to take some pictures, Bill?
Let's just go by the - whatever the Flight Plan says there.
Alright.
Let's see what it says to do. SPS monitor, you're all through with that? Camera Prep.
Okay, Jim has got to get them out or I'll have to - one of us - both of us probably had best get them out.
Yeah, I'll just take a look here a minute.
Which ones are the craters?
Don't we - we have a lot of time for looking; let's get those cameras out. Here, do you want to stick those in, Jim? Please, when you go by?
GDC aligned, IMU/Orb-rate.
Okay, Orb-rate, lunar power.
Can I call a Verb 83 here, Jim?
Oh, you're within...
Huh?
Yeah, you can do that. You're below 482 miles or whatever it is.
197.
Huh? What are you doing?
What do you need? Who are you talking to, me?
Yes, I thought you said something about Verb 97?
Oh.
You get the camera equipment, and I'll get this stuff out.
Okay, what's our camera configuration, Frank?
Okay, stand by a minute while I get...
Call them out real loud, because I'm going off the air.
Alright, I'm supposed to - Let's see; 16, 18, new C, exposure, 1/250th; 1 foot per second, one Mag[azine].
[Garble.]
Yeah, new C.
Check.
Right.
Hey, you know something; it's gray, huh?
Yeah.
Okay, I've got to roll right, so watch out.
Go easy on those thrusters.
[Singing.]
You got that thing running, Bill?
What's that, Frank?
The camera?
[Garble.]
Yeah. Just a minute.
[Garble] Frank. You got the cameras [garble].
2; 150th; new; B&W; mag[azine] D.
[Garble.]
1 - 1/80; B&W; 1/250th.
Okay.
Okay, let's get a lens.
2, 150?
50 millimeter...
2; 150; new; black and white; mag D.
I've got mag D.
Okay. Okay, mag D. I got it off the camera. 70 millimeter?
[Garble] number 2 with this lens.
Okay. What else? Filters?
Doesn't say anything about filters. Oh, yes, red and black filter, U-4.
You got that? Okay.
Something went flying down when we started burning, didn't it?
[Garble.]
Huh?
[Garble.]
No.
Did I write on there that - the orbit we are in?
It was just what they told me, yes - 169.1 by 60.5 [nautical miles, 313.2 by 112 km].]
Okay. Okay, when I give the burn status report there, will you...
Hey, look at - Can you put these cameras someplace? Stash them against the back of your bulkhead. Stash this back there, too.
Hey, you're maneuvering quite rapidly.
No, I'm not.
Well.
Tape, Bill. Thank you.
[Garble.]
Are these cameras all set up right?
Huh?
[Garble.]
Huh?
[Garble.]
Can I take one?
[Garble.]
That's what I thought: it doesn't work.
Well, that - the camera doesn't work.
You want me to try it out?
Yeah.
[Garble.]
Huh? Does it work now?
[Garble.]
We're not that hard up; don't worry about it.
Listen, we're not going to...
I just want to take a picture.
Hey, look; just slow down and take your time. Okay.
f/8.
f/8 at what?
[Garble.]
Okay.
Okay. Bill, get me MSFN, will you?
AOS at 69:31.
Oh, is it that late? Okay, I thought it was...
Can you see it? Huh?
Yep, [garble].
It says I'm supposed to run one mag here of 16-millimeter; new color exposure [means exterior film], 1/250th, spot, 1 foot [means frame] per second.
[Garble] Flight Plan (garble]
Wait a second, Bill.
Take your time; go slow.
Did you take your bracket up?
No.
[Garble.]
I'll get it.
[Garble.]
Where is it?
[Garble.]
Boy, there're no shadows in those craters down there. Are we near the subsolar point?
Yes.
The subsolar point?
Yes, getting close to it.
What's our attitude?
Well, we're pitch down. We're going around it.
Are we heads up?
Yeah.
Jim, have you unstowed the orbital charts?
Yeah, I'm in the process right now. I've got part of them unstowed.
[Garble], Frank.
Okay.
[Garble.]
Why don't we put it - why don't we temporarily stow it someplace? You're never going to use this thing at all? I think you're making a big mistake using that 250-millimeter [lens].
No, not on [garble] because that's [garble].
Oh.
Well...
Where do we start doing the fan work, Frank?
Well, first of all, we've got to got these cameras set up.
Bill, that's not in the Flight Plan.
You want me to take pictures with that 16-millimeter?
Frank, [garble.]
New color exposure [means exterior film], 1/250th, spot[meter], 1 foot [means frame] per second; one whole magazine they want.
[Garble.]
I need the camera.
What are you doing, Jim?
Trying to figure out where we are, Frank.
Alright, it's 11 south, 118 west.
Is that all set?
Okay, we should be...
We're passing over Brand right now.
Brand?
Brand right about now.
Holy cow, there's no resolution whatso - there's no shadows on the craters.
Hey, there we go. There we are.
[Garble.]
Is that Tsiolkovsky?
[Garble.]
Okay, we'll go upside down.
Well, listen, Bill, if this is the way it goes, the way you say, look at that.
You have it all the way in, Frank?
Yeah. There's a stop on that thing; it won't go any higher than that.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [Long pause.]
Gee, you ought to get a picture of Tsiolkovsky.
[Garble.]
Hey, how am I going to get any fan, with this window the way it is?
Frank?
I don't know, Jim.
I'm going to have to use another window.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [Long pause.]
[Garble.]
Okay, here we go.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [Long pause.]
What do you want this on, Bill?
Oh, where's the other Flight Plan?
Okay, be about - Going to f/8, Frank.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [Long pause.]
f/8?
And we just passed the subsolar point.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. Over.
You through with the Flight Plan?
No.
Can I have that other Flight Plan when you get a chance?
Are you hooked on to them, Bill?
Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [Long pause.]
Houston, Houston, this is Apollo 8. Over.
He's answering you.
Go ahead, Houston, (This is) Apollo 8. Burn complete. Our orbit (is) 160.9 [sic] by 60.5; 169.1 by 60.5.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Roger, 169.1 by 60.5. Good to hear your voice. [Long pause.]
