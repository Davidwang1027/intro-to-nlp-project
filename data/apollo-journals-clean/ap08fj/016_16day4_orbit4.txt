What time are you supposed to be pitching up?
I don't pitch up until [garble].
Okay.
Alright, we're going to roll.
Ready? Set.
The impact crater was at - just prior to subsolar point on the south side, in the floor of it, [garble] - There is one dark hole, and I couldn't get a quick enough look at it to see if it might be anything volcanic.
Oh, my God! Look at that picture over there! Here's the Earth coming up. Wow, is that pretty!
Hey, don't take that, it's not scheduled. (Chuckle.)
[Laughter.] You got a color film, Jim?
Hand me that roll of color quick, will you...
Oh man, that's great!
...Hurry. Quick.
Gee.
It's down here?
Just grab me a color. That color exterior.
[Garble].
Hurry up!
Got one?
Yeah, I'm looking for one.
C 368.
Anything, quick.
Here.
Well, I think we missed it.
Hey, I got it right here! [In the hatch window.]
Let - let me get it out this window. It's a lot clearer.
Bill, I got it framed; it's very clear right here.
You got it?
Yep.
Well, take several of them.
Take several of them! Here, give it to me.
Wait a minute, let's get the right setting, here now; just calm down. Calm down, Lovell.
Well, I got it ri - Oh, that's a beautiful shot.
250 at f/11.
Okay.
Now vary the - vary the exposure a little bit.
I did. I took two of them.
You sure we got it now?
Yeah, we'll get - we'll - It'll come up again, I think.
Just take another one, Bill.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.
Roger. We've been having a little antenna problem on the ground here. We're reading you now with a lot of noise in the background. How me?
Loud and clear, Michael. [Long pause.]
Roger, Frank. We're still trying to get a bit better comm here. Stand by; you're unreadable.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
You're loud and clear, Houston. Apollo 8
Rog. Understand you're reading us loud and clear; we're barely reading you. Would you go to P00 and Accept, please? We're going to send you a P27 update.
Roger. Going to P00 and to Accept. [Long pause.]
We're in P00 and Accept, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. You're unreadable. We're going to delay that P27 until we get a little bit better lock on you. [Long pause.]
As long as you're reading me okay, Frank, I'll bring you up to date on a couple of things. The P27 which we will be sending you is a state vector update going to the LM slot, and we'd like you, as per plan, to transfer that to the CSM slot by a Verb 47 Enter, and we'd like to just remind you that prior to doing your Verb 47 Enter, manually select P00 and wait for the computer activity light to go out. Did you copy? Over.
Roger. Roger. We copy. [Pause.]
Okay, Frank. Are you still reading me loud and clear? Over.
Roger. Loud and clear.
All right. I'll go ahead with a map update when you're ready to copy. [Pause.]
Okay. Can you hold off a minute? [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. How are you reading now? [Long pause.]
Go ahead, Houston. This is Apollo 8. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston with a map update. Are you ready to copy?
Just a minute, Mike.
Roger. Apollo 8, Houston. Your map update for rev 4/5: LOS, 76:59:59; sunrise, 77:09:06; prime meridian, 77:15:47; AOS, 77:45:50; sunset, 78:22:03; IP-1 position time for control point 2, 77:29:42; IP-1 time closest approach for target B-1, 78:10:25. Over.
We'll have to get that data later on. [Pause.]
We'll try it again later, Frank.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Do you want to take this nav sighting?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Roger, Houston. How do you read?
Reading you a lot better now, Bill. How are you reading me?
I'm reading you five - loud and clear, and are you copying our low bit data to record this - these tracking passes? Over.
That's affirmative. We are getting low bit data now.
Okay. I've played the - run the tape recorder back to the beginning. We have quite a bit of high bit, so all you'll have to do is start recording when you're ready. [Pause.]
Roger. Stand by one, Bill. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Stand by one on the tape recorder dump. We'd like you to look at your steam pressure. We think that the primary evaporator may have dried out, and if the steam pressure shows off-scale low, would you please close the back pressure valve and reservice the evaporator? Over.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We're ready to send you the P27 LM state vector update when you are ready. Over.
You'll have to wait until this tracking exercise is over with, Mike.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Were you calling? Over.
Roger. You can go ahead now and give you the computer, get the updates, and let's get going on the PAD messages.
Roger. [Pause.]
It's in P00 and Accept. [Pause.]
Okay, Houston. You ready to talk about the water boiler problem?
Rog. We copy you in P00 and Accept, and we're sending you a P27 LM state vector. On the water boiler, it looks to us like the evaporator has been reserviced. How does it look to you? Over.
Roger. I reserviced it, put it to Auto, H2O flow to Auto; and the steam pressure went to zero again. So I tried reservicing it a second time for 1 minute, and again no results. I'm in the present process of closing the back-pressure valve manually. Over.
Roger. Understand you've tried to reservice it twice, both times steam pressure has gone to zero, and now you're closing the back-pressure valve manually.
Roger. Each time I've reserviced it, the steam pressure came up to about 0.07 to 0.1; but as soon as the steam and water were put to Auto, the steam pressure went right back down again.
Roger. We copy, and we're reading you loud and clear now, Bill. On your map update, did you copy that that I gave you previously? [Pause.]
Negative. We have not copied it yet.
Negative.
Okay. I have it for you again when you're ready to copy.
Ready to copy.
This is a map update for revs 4/5: LOS, 76:59:59; sunrise, 77:09:06; prime meridian, 77:15:47; AOS, 77:45:50; sunset, 78:22:03. Remarks: IP-1, acquisition time for CP2 is 77:29:42; IP-1 time closest approach for target B-1, 78:10:25. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. LOS, 76:59:59; sunrise, 77:09:06; 77:45:47; 77:45:50; 78:22:03; IP-1, CP2, 77:29:42; IP-1, TCA for B1, 78:10:25.
That's right, and the prime meridian time is 77:15:47, and you got your computer back. We've got a good P27 update.
Okay. We will go to P00 and Transfer.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Houston, do you have a TEI-5 for us?
We're working on it now, Frank. Have it for you momentarily.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go.
Roger. On your back-pressure valve, we'd like to know how long after you closed the back-pressure valve the first time - how long it was from the time you closed it until you started the reservicing. We'd like you to wait about 15 minutes to prevent any ice from forming due to flash freezing. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. I start immediately to reservice it. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We showed that you closed it this last time about 4 minutes ago, so we'd like to wait another 15 minutes and then try to reservice it again at that time and then go to Auto. Over. [Pause.]
Roger.
Roger. Thank you. The TEI-4 PAD which you have is still valid. We'll have a TEI-5 PAD for you shortly.
Roger. And be advised we're presently in steam pressure, Manual, and we're in H2O flow, Auto; and are now in H2O flow, Off, as of about 5 seconds ago.
Roger. We copy that, Bill. [Pause.] And we confirm that's a good configuration.
Right now, I've got the H2O flow, Off. Do we stay that way?
Affirmative. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. On your television update, we propose that you start the TV at the Flight Plan time of 85 hours, 37 minutes and simply extend the stop time a few minutes. You're currently scheduled to stop at 86 hours, and we'd like to keep it going until the terminator, which should be approximately 86:14. Over.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Frank, I know you're busy up there. We've got the daily news for you whenever and if ever you'd like to hear it.
I'll give you a call.
Apollo 8, this is Houston.
Go ahead.
I have the TEI-5 PAD for you whenever you're ready to copy.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. TEI-5; SPS/G&N; 47 - correction - 45701; minus 0.43, plus 1.16; 079:21:26.03. Are you with me so far?
Roger.
Plus 3117.1, minus 0076.7, minus 0021.4; 180, 017, 001; not applicable, plus 0018.8; 3118.1, 2:59, 3100.3. Are you with me? Over.
Roger.
Roger. 40, 271.1 39.8; 033, down 04.3, left 2.3; plus 08.32, minus 165.00; 1295.6, 36208, 146:39:44; north set of stars remain Sirius and Rigel; roll, pitch, and yaw remain same angles, 129, 155, 010; ullage remains 2 quads for 20 seconds, quads B and D. Horizon on 4 degree line at TIG minus 3 minutes. Over.
Roger. Here we go. TEI-5; SPS/G&N; 45701; minus 0.43, plus 1.16; 079:21:26.03; plus 3117.1, minus 0076.7, minus 00214; 180, 017, 001; N/A, plus 0018.8; 3118.1, 2:59, 3100.3; 40, 271.1, 39.8; 033, down 04.3, left 2.3; plus 08.32, minus 165.00; plus 1295.6, 36208, 146:39:44. Set stars are the same; ullage - we'd like - do you have any objection to using four quads for 15 seconds? [Pause.]
No objection to four-quad ullage, Apollo 8.
Okay. We'd like to just go ahead and use four quads at all times, unless we get a lot shorter on fuel than we are now.
Understand.
And is that 15 seconds?
Affirmative: 15 seconds, four quads.
Apollo 8...
Thank you, and horizon is 4 degrees at minus...
That readback is correct, Frank, and we'd like to advise that the voice quality on the high bit rate is excellent. Over.
Thank you. Mike, it's 4 quads for 15 seconds. Is that right?
That is affirmative, Apollo 8: 4 quads for 15 seconds.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. For Bill, he can go ahead and do his standard reservice on the - on the water now. It's looking good.
Okay. You want us to reservice it now?
That's affirmative. And upon completion, go back to Auto.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We are still dumping your tape. The voice quality on high bit is coming through superb, and you are Go for next rev. And we'd like to get a brief status report on your rest between 60 hours and LOI-1, just to fill in some information for us. [Pause.]
We only got a couple of hours rest.
Okay. [Pause.]
We're tired right now, but we will have to wait until TEI before we get back to the regular cycle.
I suspect you're right.
Okay, Houston. The water boiler has been reserviced. Back-pressure valve closed for 1 minute; water, On, for 2; and it's now steam pressure, Auto; H2O flow, Auto.
Roger. We copy, Bill. [Long pause.]
If we have a problem, a similar problem, again on the back side in the sunlight, might be a good idea to crank up the secondary loop until we have AOS. What do you think about that?
Stand by one, Bill.
Apollo 8, Houston. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Jim. In regard to your evaporator, we feel that if you do have a similar problem next time on the back side in the sunlight, check the evaporator outlet temperature, and if it gets above 60, we concur that it would be a good idea to bring up the secondary loop. Over.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. When we say bring up the secondary loop, we mean bring up the evaporator only on the secondary loop. Copy?
Roger.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. We got time for a little news.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
I say how about a little bit of that news you promised?
Roger. We got the Interstellar Times here, the December 24 edition. Your TV program was a big success. It was viewed this morning by most of the nations of your neighboring planet, the Earth. It was carried live all over Europe, including even Moscow and East Berlin. Also in Japan and all of North and Central America, and parts of South America. We don't know yet how extensive the coverage was in Africa. Are you copying me all right? Over.
You are loud and clear.
Good. San Diego welcomed home today the Pueblo crew in a big ceremony. They had a pretty rough time of it in the Korean prison. Christmas cease-fire is in effect in Vietnam, with only sporadic outbreaks of fighting. And if you haven't done your Christmas shopping by now, you better forget it.
Thank you.
A couple of [Houston] Oilers made the All Star team, Webster and Farr.
Roger. [Pause.]
And that's about all our news. How about your news?
Well, we'll be looking forward to a big burn here shortly.
Roger.
Mike, I think I can say it without contradiction, it's been a mighty long dry spell up here.
I guess you can say anything you like without contradiction.
When do we dump water, Houston?
Say again, Frank.
When can we dump water?
Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go, Houston.
We will get you the number after a while on your water dump. It looks like the quantity isn't increasing very slightly, and we're considering not only the quantity in regard to the dump, but also its effects on the trajectory relative to TEI and so forth, but we will have a good answer for you shortly.
We are not just thinking about the waste water tank: we're thinking about some other kind of water that has to get dumped out of the spacecraft, slightly used water.
Rog. We understand.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We have about 3½ minutes to LOS. We'll give you back the DSE under your control, and in regard to your water dump, we're tentatively predicting a waste water tank dump at about 80 hours GET and any other dumps are your discretion, any time you'd like to make them.
Thank you. [Pause.]
People listening to the high bit rate down here say it's like sitting in your living room listening to a good hi-fi. [Pause.]
Sounds like a good idea. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Coming up on two minutes to LOS. We got a good reservice on the primary evaporator, and everything is still looking very good down here.
Okay. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. One minute to LOS. Are you still reading us loud and clear?
Loud and clear. Loud and clear.
Okay, fine. We've been noticing a little bit of increase in our background noise as you approach the back side.
Rog. We had to go off the High Gain. That's why.
Roger. [Pause.]
Have a good back-side; we'll see you next time around.
Okay, Mike.
