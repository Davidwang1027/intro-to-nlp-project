Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Reading you weak but clear.
Okay. Thank you, Jerry.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston, Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. I've got a little news and some ball scores if you want them.
Go ahead.
Okay. The big news right now, on the wires, is that all 82 crewmen of the Pueblo have been returned. They walked across the Bridge of Freedom, Monday night.
Wonderful!
Said it took about 30 minutes for all 82 men to come across the Bridge of No Return and that's the one separating North and South Korea. They started across about 11:30 am and were over by about noon, and they brought the body of the crewman who was killed, also.
Okay, Frank. On ball scores, did you get the word on the Baltimore/Minnesota game today?
Not the final one.
Okay. Final score was the Colts 24, Vikings 14. That gives them the western conference, so it looks like, for the NFL title, it's gonna be the Browns versus the Colts on the 29th.
29th?
Rog. Slow return - you'll get it.
Say again.
Roger. Come back slow return and we'll get it.
I'd rather come back fast and watch it on television.
Atta boy! Let's see, for the AFL: the big game today was Oakland and Kansas City and Oakland dumped them 41 to 6, so it's looks the AFL title game will be the Raiders and Jets.
Righto! That's hard to believe, that score.
Amen! Okay. In yesterday's game, I don't know if you got the score on that. The Cleveland Browns and the Cowboys. The Browns dumped the Cowboys 31 to 20.
Yeah, we heard that.
Yeah, they're crying in Dallas. Basketball scores: Houston didn't do so good this weekend. The Illinois beat Houston 97 to 84. And North Carolina took the Owls. The score was 85 - 77. We had a couple of words in the paper, Frank, on the Oilers. The Oilers voted George Webster their most valuable player and - although Houston didn't make anybody on the All-AFL Offensive Team this year, they put Walt Suggs and Hoyle Granger on the second team.
Very good.
But although the Oilers didn't do so well out on the field, they did great in the box office. Bud Adams, Don Klausterman and Wally Lemm were all - real pleased with it. By the way, they were at the Cape to watch the show. Houston, in 11 games - the Oilers attracted 460,628 people.
That must be a record? For them? I don't believe they ever got that many in Rice Stadium.
I think so. Let's see, the regular season attendance was about half of that. This includes all the exhibition games. The paper says they averaged about 40,480 for the league games.
Great!
Well, that's about it for now, Frank. We got some more news that they promised they'd bring over as soon as it comes off the wire. The only things of real interests were the - particularly was the Pueblo release. I think you've already been told about the - Nixon- Eisenhower wedding. And about the only other thing is the weather which is pretty clear around here. We've got high overcasts. But it's cold and good visibility, and it's beginning to feel like winter again.
Good time for Christmas, good weather for Christmas.
Who have you got up now, Frank?
The other two guys are pretty sleepy. They sacked out again. So I'm holding the fort down for a while.
Okay. Thanks.
Rog. Thank you.
Frank, we had a little eggnog over at Charlie Duke's tonight.
Say again.
We had a little eggnog over at Charlie Duke's tonight. Val Anders dropped by. She's looking fine. Tell Bill she's doing real well.
Fine.
How do you like shift work, Jerry?
It's great, Frank. You've got the Black Watch watching you tonight.
Yeah, that's what I figured.
Boy, Jerry. That old Earth is sure looking small.
Rog. I guess it'll get smaller, too.
Yeah, we're getting along pretty good, though, now.
Real good. It looks like you're approaching 150,000 miles.
Roger.
How's the Moon look, Frank?
Say again.
Have you looked at the Moon lately?
No. I saw it yesterday, but we haven't seen it today.
Frank, you've probably already been told this, but you looked great on TV today. One little homey item, though. In the El Lago area you were upstaged by Santa Claus. He came around on a fire engine just about the time you guys came on. So most of the little critters were all outside.
That's good. I wish we could have got that one lens working. I'd like to share the view we have here of Earth.
Frank, we've got some guys looking at it. We might be able to find a way to make it work for you. Hopefully, by a couple of hours before TV time tomorrow, we'll have an answer.
Very good.
Jack Schmitt's working with us, too.
Very good. That's Typhoid Jack.
This comm is so good we don't figure we'll have much to debrief.
Roger. Probably the biggest part of the debrief will be the medical part.
Roger. You're sure right. Oh, we're all in fine shape.
Real fine, Frank.
Houston, Apollo 8. We just completed the canister change.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Copy.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We have a handover coming up in 2½ minutes to Guam. Over.
Okay, Jerry. Thank you. Hey, Jerry?
Go ahead.
How about the long-range guess on what the weather is going to be like in the recovery area on Friday.
Rog, Frank.
Apollo 8, Houston, with a weather watch.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. For 7 degrees, 38 minutes north; 165 west landing area, we're showing 2,000 scattered, 12,000 broken, high over at 10; with the winds from the east at 12, 4-foot swells, about an 82-degree temperature. There'll be some rain showers in about 10 to 30 percent of the area with ceilings around 2,000. If there is - turns out to be a thunderstorm in the area, it'll probably have a ceiling around 500 feet.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Did you copy that weather okay?
Roger. I said thank you. Do you read me now?
Roger. Reading you much better. We got the voice coming down through Honeysuckle now.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. Can you cycle the H2 and O2 cryo fans now for us?
Rog. Will start her now with H2. Manual, 2 minutes.
Roger.
You may need to call us now and then. Everybody's a little drowsy.
Okay, Frank.
That completes it, Jerry. They're all cycled through.
Roger, Frank.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger.
Did you get my message about the fans?
Sure did, Frank. Thanks.
Okay.
Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Rog. The cabin temperature's down to 60, and it's getting pretty chilly. You got any approved solutions on how to bring it up without screwing up this nice thermal balance we've had?
Roger. Stand by.
Frank, do you have your cabin fans on?
Negative.
Roger.
We haven't had them on since we separated.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Frank. Midcourse number 3 looks like just a shade more than 1 foot per second, so we don't recommend that you do it. That leads us off into a midcourse 4 of only about 3 feet per second right now. Your trajectory is looking real good. Your height at pericynthion is 70 miles.
Roger. Understand. Thank you.
Roger. Roger, Frank. Little few thoughts on what's coming up now. The star sightings, when Jim gets up, looks right now like we've had enough of the Earth horizon. Everything looks real good; and we're ready to start on some lunar horizon sightings. So when Jim gets up, we'll pass the Flight Plan update to him for a set of stars with the Moon. Also, around 48 or after the star sightings is when we'd like to see your next water dump come up. So, if you can, I recommend you get a little shut-eye.
Rog. You got any answers on warming this place up a little bit?
Roger. They're still cranking around. They're talking about cabin fans, but that sounds like sort of a noisy proposition.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Got two methods for you to warm up the cabin there. The first one is a one-man job. About the best way would be to put one or both cabin fans on, and go full hot on the cabin heat exchanger. It'll be a fairly slow process of warming up, and you won't get a whole lot of heating. Your second method would be to adjust, with the mixing valve, your Radiator Out temperatures. This, again, is a two-man job. You have to be pretty careful.
Rog. Well, Frank just went to bed, and Bill isn't up yet. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll put on the fans and we'll - I'll go High on the cabin temperature and see what that does.
Okay, Jim. Remember, if you use just one fan, cover the other.
Rog.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. If I use just one fan - You mentioned about covering the other one - are you sure that's true in this spacecraft?
Roger. That's affirmative.
I thought that was a Block I problem.
Stand by. Jim. We'll recheck on that one.
Apollo 8, Houston. Did you get the word from Frank on the star-sighting plan?
Rog. I'll get out the Flight Plan if you have an update to it now, though. We can certainly update it right now.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8. Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. You ready for that Flight Plan update?
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. At time 47:15, delete the P23 sightings you're showing there; and at 45 minutes - correction, 45 hours, add one additional set of sightings to each star.
Okay. You say at 45 hours we're going to add one set of sightings to each of the three stars. Is that correct?
That's affirmative. Everybody's real pleased with the Earth horizon work; and as far as we're concerned, you can knock that off, and just add one set to each one of your lunar horizon stars at about 45. This 45-hour time also is not hard. You can shift it as your - as you desire.
Roger. As I see things coming up now, Jerry, we're going to get some block data around 44, and we'll do alignment around 44:30 and then we'll go into cislunar navigation.
Okay. Fine, Jim. Then remember after you do the sightings, we'll want you to go back to the PTC mode again. And a little curiosity, how's the water tasting, and how did you sleep?
Water's tasting okay; no problems. And the sleep is getting better: We find it better to sleep underneath the couch now. I was up here with Frank, and I was dozing off periodically over the last several hours. Frank's now down below and Bill's below, too.
Okay, Jim; thanks.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, we've got a command handover from Guam to Honeysuckle coming up in about 2½ minutes.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8. This is Flight...
I might add that at this distance...
Say again, Apollo 8.
I might add that at this distance, there is no problem - there is no problem in seeing stars in the daylight at this distance.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 8, Flight.
This is 8; go ahead.
Jim, are you talking about out the window or out any of the - or out the telescope?
I'm looking out the window right now. I have the lights out in the spacecraft, the window covered where the Sun is, and I can see stars very well out the left rendezvous window.
Okay. I guess that window's still pretty good for you then, huh?
That's right. It's one of the few that is. The center window, unfortunately, is all fogged over; it looks like a coating of ice or coating of heavy fog. Bill claims it's something else, though.
Roger. By the way. I am just getting OJT (On Job Training) on this CapCom job while Jerry's out of the room.
Well, we all have to learn sometime.
Yes sir.
You picked a midnight shift, I see.
Yeah. Turning out to be kind of quiet, too.
We like it that way.
Well, things will pick up here by tomorrow night, I think.
I believe you're right.
We're starting to show cabin temperature at 70, so it may be warming up for you.
Well, we can feel it warm up. I have both fans on and the - our gauge indicates about 70.
Okay. And I got a real CapCom back now.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.
Apollo 8. This is Houston, with a flyby, and a PC, pericynthion plus 2 hours maneuver PAD, when you're ready to copy.
Roger. Ready to copy.

Roger, Jim. That's all correct.
Apollo 8, Houston. That PC plus 2 is a fast return.
Roger. Understand. Fast return.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. Just some interesting things on the - just done a Nav with the Moon; the Sun is practically right in the way. I managed to get one set on Antares and was working on the second set, and the rim of the Moon just disappeared completely. The view through the sextant is a milky white, whether you're looking at black sky or the - or the Moon. The tint of the Moon is practically washed out by the brightness of the Sun. I'll try the next star and see what I can do with it.
Roger, Jim.
Good morning, Houston. How are the systems looking here lately?
Mornin', sleepy head. Systems are looking Go.
Good deal.
How'd you sleep, Bill?
Oh, off and on, Jerry. There was quite a bit of noise in here, and anytime somebody responds to a transmission, why, it tends to wake you up. But it was a reasonably good rest.
Real fine. We got a little work scheduled for you here. We've got an ECS redundant component check to run and some fuel cell purging to do.
Okay. How about if we wait until this nav exercise is over with?
Rog.
Bill, what we have planned for you right after Jim gets finished is a waste water dump, a cryo fan cycle, redundant component check, and a fuel cell purge.
Roger.
We'll be wanting an O2 and H2 fuel cell purge; we'll give you a 20-minute hack on the heater.
Okay. Want me to turn them on now or when you give me a hack?
You better wait about 20 minutes.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Bill, are you still eating?
Doing what?
Are you busy eating?
Negative. I'm watching the store while Jim does his Nav sighting and then recording the data for him.
Okay. We have a correction to make to your TLI plus 44-hour PAD. If you've got a chance there, we'd like to fire it on up to you.
Stand by.
Roger.
Okay. Ready to copy the correction to TLI plus 44.
Roger. The correction is in the remarks at the end. Delete the reference to high speed procedure minus MA.
Roger. Delete minus MA slash NC-1, Charlie.
That's affirmative, and copy the following. This comment should read, "use P37 NC-4, step 1 through 11." Over.
Rog. Use P37 NC-4, steps 1 through 11.
Roger. Then proceed to longitude control for no comm procedure, page NC-7.
You went a little fast. Say again the page.
Roger, That page is NC-7. I'll read that again. Then proceed to longitude control for no comm procedure, page NC-7. Average 400K - V 400K, for corridor control charts is 36253. I repeat, average V 400K for corridor control charts is 36253. Over.
Roger. Say again. That's average G as in George.
Negative. Average Victor 400K for corridor control chart is 36253.
Roger. Average V 400K for corridor control chart is 36253.
Roger. The minus MA procedure is okay after abort when the GERU is less than 07990.
Roger. Minus MA procedure okay for abort when GERU less than 07990.
Roger. I'll read back the entire remarks now just to make sure we got it straight. Use P37 NC-4, steps 1 through 11; then proceed to longitude control for no comm procedure on page NC-7; average Victor 400K for corridor control chart is 36253; Minus MA procedure is okay after abort when GERU is less than 07990.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Bill, you can turn on the H2 purge line heater now.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, when you get a chance, either you or Bill, would you give us a crew status report on you and Bill?
Rog. We're going to finish up this one set of stars for you, then we'll do that.
Okay.
Have you been getting this data down there in Houston?
That's affirmative, Apollo 8.
Jim, so far we've only missed one point; we'll ask you to read it back a little bit later.
Which one do you need?
Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston. What, we need is the third mark on the first set, star 33, trunnion only. Over.
Roger. That's the only one we're in doubt of. We think it was 12020.
Roger. Copy.
Okay, that completes 23 for this time, Houston. Are you satisfied?
Roger, Jim.
Houston, for information, the last two stars, 34 and 40, were shot at the very tip of the thin rim, and you practically have to imagine the rim continuing on past where it goes into the darkness.
Roger. Understand they were shot at the tip of the lit rim.
That's affirmative, and the area around the entire Moon now, both the sky and the Moon itself, are all milky white because of the nearness of the Sun.
Roger. Copying.
Apollo 8, Houston. You can reestablish PTC, same attitude, 224 and 20.
Roger, Houston. I'm heading that way now.
Okay.
Apollo 8; Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
We'd like to have you start your waste water dump...
Go ahead, Houston.
We'd like to have you start your waste water dump as soon as you can; dump to 20 percent. We're doing this in order to get 71 percent at LOI. Over.
Understand; 20 percent.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We see the waste water coming down now. While it's on its way down, how about a cryo fan cycle?
Okay. Cryo fan cycle; I'll cycle the H2 and O2 fans, one at a time, 2 minutes each.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're showing you at 20.0 percent now.
Roger. We're showing about 25. We'll shut it off now.
Roger. Next on deck is the fuel cell H2, O2 purge.
Stand by.
Okay. Houston, we're ready to start the purge.
Roger, Bill. While you're purging, can you give us a crew status report?
That's going to be O2 and H2. Is that correct?
Affirmative.
Roger. H2 first, okay?
Roger. That's okay.
We're getting H2 flow, Jerry, but we don't see any - any vapor particles anywhere. Some are starting now.
Roger. We confirm your flow and understand you're seeing particles now.
Yeah, not much, though. Okay. going to go to number 2.
Roger.
You know, it's really too bad these side windows are fogged up because we never see any Sun in the rendezvous windows, and we can't get very good pictures through these foggy ones.
Roger.
Okay. Starting number 3, H2.
Okay. Start number 3, O2.
Roger, Apollo 8. Apollo 8, this is Houston. Would you set for Accept for a P27 update, state vector to your LM side, and we'd like you to...
say again.
Roger, Bill. Would you set up to Accept a state vector update? We'll be putting it in the LM slot, and do not unzap. Over.
Roger. Normal, Accept.
We're going to put the word "zap" back in the dictionary.
Roger, Batman.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Might be interesting to note that after nav sightings, we ran out P21, and we get a pericynthion now of 66.8 miles.
Roger, 8. We copy.
I knew if he did it long enough, he'd finally get one that was close.
Okay. Starting fuel cell 2.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Your state vector update is complete and verified. You can have the computer back in Block. Over.
Roger.
Okay. Going to number 1, O2.
Roger, Bill.
Old Helmut Kuehnel's kitchen timer's pretty nice.
Roger, Bill. You can turn off your H2 heaters now.
Wilco.
Bill, we show you 168,000 out, and we're getting - still getting pretty good high bit rate off the 30-foot dishes.
Okay. I'm in Narrow Beam High Gain now. Were you getting good high bit rate on the Omni?
That's affirmative. We're back on High Gain now.
Okay, number 1 O2 is off, and will you clarify your previous statement. Were you getting good high bit rate while we were on the Omnis about 10 minutes ago? Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. That's affirmative. We were getting fairly good high bit rate with a little bit of noise.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger. We only got two things left to do now. We need your crew status report and a redundant component check.
Okay. Jim will give you the latter - former, and I'll give you the latter.
Okay.
Bill, EECOM says thanks for the good job of keeping the Omnis moving.
Roger. We'll make any sacrifice as long as they keep an eye on the systems.
Wilco.
Who's on the watch with you?
It's just me right now.
How about EECOM?
Oh, we have Clint. The Black Watch is watching.
Okay. Stay alert.
Roger. The Black Watch is watching.
Roger. I'll stay - Roger. I'll stay alert.
Okay, Houston. Here comes the status report.
Roger. We're ready to copy.
For sleep - Roger. For sleep, each of us has had two sleep periods; Frank's in his third one right now. Bill's had 6 hours the last time; I had 4 hours the last time. Good to fair, both of us. Frank had 5 hours the last time, of fair. And Frank, of course, is sleeping now.
Roger, Jim. How are the three of you feeling?
We're all feeling pretty good now; no problems. We've all had about between 40 and 60 ounces of - or clicks of water so far today.
Okay.
The food: we're up to - we've eaten day 2, meal 2 so far. And both of us have eaten the rehydratables and the juices and about half of the solids.
Roger. Copy.
The cabin's running slightly cold. We do have one cabin fan on, and we're in full heat, and it's running just slightly under 70. Might be a design note for future spacecraft.
Roger, Jim. That fan pretty noisy?
It's not as noisy as both fans when they're running; we cut it down to one fan.
Roger. We keep thinking we hear it when you're talking to us.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Houston, we're showing a glycol Evap Out Temp around 44, and a Rad Out Temp of about 28. I wonder if we might try some manual mixing here to raise the glycol Evap Temp Out a little bit?
Roger, Bill. Stand by.
Okay. Houston, secondary loop is coming up.
Roger, Bill.
Okay. We're boiling the secondary Evap, and the temperature's stabilized, and so we're gonna close up the Evap pressure valve.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Bill. Before you try the manual mixing, we'd like you to give it a whirl at the manual and increase on the cabin temp. Over.
We've done that. We're in full hot, and what is your - what's the lowest Rad Out - individual Rad Out Temp you seen here during our PTC?
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We saw 26 one time.
Roger. Understand; plus 26.
Affirmative.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead with your manual mixing. Suggest you set your Evap Out at about 55. Over.
Okay. We'll give that a try, and let us know if the Rad Out Temps get too low.
Roger. We're monitoring.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Rog. We have it stabilized about 53°, and we will leave it there, but we'll go back Auto if you start having any concern about the radiators.
Roger, Bill. We are showing 51.4 here.
Okay.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We're going to have a command changeover to Honeysuckle in about 2 minutes. Over.
Roger, Houston. Standing by.
Apollo 8, Houston. That was Honeysuckle to Madrid.
Si, Señor.
Goodbye, you chaps.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. Did you delete the cislunar nav exercise at 47:15?
That's affirmative, and we added the extra star sightings to the one at 45.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Buenas dias, muchachos.
Buenas dias. We're going to be answering your calls pretty quietly for a little while here. Try to let the CDR get to sleep. If you can't hear us, why, just tell us so.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. My two cohorts are going to try and get some sleep here, so y'all might keep a good eye on the systems. I'm going to move over to the other side.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're getting low bit rate now. We could do better with a High Gain Antenna before you move over to the other side. Over.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger, you might just give me a call every now and then, Jerry, to just let me know you're still there, as we're switching antennas, or play some music or something.
Say again, Bill. You're kind of garbled.
I say you might just give me a call every now and then as we switch antennas, just let me know you're still there, or play some music or something, just to make sure we haven't lost comm.
Okay, Bill. Your antennas are looking good now.
Hey, Bill. If you want music, I'll have Mike sing.
Ask him to sing "Anchors Aweigh" will you?
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger.
On your - on your secondary coolant loop, looks like your back-pressure valve might be slightly open. I suggest you go to secondary coolant loop Evap switch to the Reset position for 58 seconds. Over.
I did that again; I'll try it a third time.
Okay.
That didn't do it any good, Houston.
Roger, Bill.
Keep an eye on it. See if it starts dropping. It stabilized there right after I shut the evaporator off.
Roger. We're watching.
What might have happened Jim might have gotten the water control valve off before we completely had the back-pressure valve closed.
Roger. Understand Jim turned the water control valve off.
Roger. We have the secondary water Evap control valve off, but he might have gotten it off on that return pump chart check prior to the time the evaporator back-pressure valve had completely closed, which might explain its lower-than-nominal state pressure.
Rog. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, Bill. We see your secondary steam pressure coming back up slowly, and we would like to just sit and watch it for a while before doing anything else.
Okay.
