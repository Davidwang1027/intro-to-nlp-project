Houston, we're recording altitude HA, 102.6; HP, 96.8; RVI, 25560.
Roger, Apollo 8. Understand. Apogee, 102.6; perigee, 96.8 and velocity - I understand - 25,560. Could you confirm?
That's affirmative.
Thank you, Jim.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are rewinding the tape recorder at this time. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We have you apogee 103, perigee 99. Over.
103, 99.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We have you 1 minute from LOS the Vanguard. We'll see you over the Canaries at 16:28.
Thank you, Houston; 16:28.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston through the Canaries. How do you read?
You're loud and clear, Houston, over the Canaries.
Good; you're clear, too. How's it going?
Fine. We seem to be going along very well. We noticed about a 10-pound Delta-P between the ox fuel in the SPS zone.
Apollo 8, Houston. That is normal; that's just about what we expected. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
This is 8. Go ahead.
Roger, Jim. When you do your P52, you can expect a torquing angle of 0.25 degrees. Over.
Roger. Torquing angle of 0.25 degrees when we do P52. Thank you.
Roger.
Stand by for the - Main Reg. Okay. Main Reg B valve closed.
Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
Negative. We didn't say anything. Go ahead, Houston.
I think you were transmitting; Jim was transmitting and disregard.
Roger. No matter.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. You have 1 minute to LOS Canaries. Everything is looking good on board the spacecraft and the S-IVB; we'll see you over Tananarive at 37 minutes. Over.
Roger. Thank you, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay, going to close on A.
Okay, just give it a real small flip.
Is that why we've got that Master Alarm?
Okay, I'm...
Apollo 8, Houston. You have the tape recorder, low bit rate. Over.
Thank you.
Okay, we've got it.
You're welcome.
Okay, Emergency Cabin Pressure number 2 on the test.
Hit it.
It's On here.
Got it. That's good.
You got it?
That's good.
Okay.
Okay, this is a tape recorder test: 1, 2, 3, 4. 5, 6, 7. 8. 9, 10; 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. And for the record, when we put the radiator to Flow, the Glycol Discharge Pressure dropped. Boy, it's way down there now; something's fishy.
What's wrong?
Apparently, we're getting the Glycol Discharge Pressure way down.
Oh? What was wrong?
Wait awhile; it's the glycol pump.
Huh?
You lost the glycol pump?
Guess so.
Well, take a look; are we in Primary?
Discharge pressure?
Not yet.
Huh?
You were - Oh, we're in Secondary. That's okay.
It looks to me like it's picked up here.
Okay.
Yes.
Okay, what else do you want here?
It's okay.
Okay...
Secondary radiator leak check?
I'm ready this time. It's secondary I'm not going over, there.
Okay...
Okay, Jim.
the pressure's okay?.
What do you want to do? The secondary glycol radiator?
The second - let her flow.
Well, wait a second; I'm not under the couch yet.
Okay, why don't you get underneath there, Jim, and give Frank a hand when you have a chance?
Well, how about let's take off our gloves and helmets, huh?
Okay.
Yes.
I mean, let's get comfortable. This is going to be a long trip.
You got - have you got the bags?
I'll get them.
I'll get them right now.
Okay, you want to get - Cabin Air Return valve, On.
Stand by; wait until I get my glove off.
Cabin Air Return valve is Open.
Okay?.
Okay.
Gentlemen.
Thank you.
Storage.
That's the gloves.
How's the cabin pressure, Bill?
Cabin pressure is holding good, Frank.
Okay.
You want the other bag there, Jim?
Let me see, I'm missing one bag here.
Wait one.
Here you are.
Okay, you say you've got the EPS power verifications in, Bill?
Yes, sir.
ECS monitor check?
Yes.
There is only - Oh, here it is.
Hey, it's like sitting on an ice rink, isn't it?
Yes. SPS, Bill.
SPS is roughly the same as it was. Got that one?
TLI.
Okay.
Okay. We can breathe a little bit, hear a little bit more, huh?
Yeah, that 'was quite a ride, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Man, that felt like that 1-C was like an old freight train.
It is an old freight train, pal. It really goes.
What's that noise?
That's me; I'm into the fan area.
Why don't we turn those fans off? We don't need them, do we?
Okay, let's continue on with the checklist.
Okay, secondary radiator leak check, huh?
Confirmed.
Let me get out my fuel.
Okay, we're in Power, manual 1; primary water, Auto - okay.
Is she holding us in the proper attitude?
Yeah. I don't have the ORDEAL out yet; I can't tell, but it looks real good.
Okay, notify LMP when ready to commence.
I'm ready.
Secondary glycol to radiator valve, Normal.
Okay, just give me a buzz when you're - Yes, you're good.
You got your 278 circuit breaker 1 and 2, Open, Bill?
No, I'll go get it.
Good show.
system coming up.
Huh?
They 're Off.
Okay.
You're doing the radiator leak now, huh?
Okay...
Have you got the radiator's talkback gray? Are you ready, Jim?
All set whenever you are.
Okay, hit it. Everything is normal. Don't drop, you mother. Looking good. Hold this for a little while longer.
Okay, let's go, Jim.
Going to Bypass.
Go back to Bypass. Good show.
Okay. Frank?
Yeah.
You want the ORDEAL?
Yeah.
Okay, troops, I'm switching the other compressors.
Here you go.
I'm starting the redundant component check.
Thank you, Bill.
Bill, let me take out the wire; it's easier on it.
Alright.
Okay.
Now, do you want the - What else do you want?
Well, you've got to get the camera bracket out for Bill.
Can we - let's see, can we - What are you doing, Bill?
I just quit checking the compressor. I'm doing the redundant components check.
Okay, secondary glycol pump is On.
Can you get that ORDEAL wire in that thing down there, Jim?
Yeah.
Okay, secondary coolant loop's going to Evap.
How's that?
Oh, you sweet little mother.
Is that okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
Secondary Evap has stabilized.
Camera bracket.
Thank you. That's Frank's.
Huh?
That's the long one.
What are you doing?
Drinking water.
I'm not sure, but it sure looks like the long one.
Just make sure we get the right one.
Well, we'll get the other one.
Jim, where's the other camera bracket?
Well, there's - I only saw the one in there; I may be wrong.
Yeah, this is yours, Frank. You want to stick it here?
I don't want mine up here all the time.
The water's Off.
Okay.
You might try the drinking water before we leave on TLI, too, by the way.
We can get it out over Hawaii.
Hey, I don't want this thing up here; it's going to just be in my way. You sure this isn't yours?
Just stick it up until we get another one.
Should I wait for another one?
Yeah.
Well, is there another camera bracket? How many camera brackets in that - that -?
I thought there were two in there.
I did, too.
That's the best we're going to get.
Okay, I'm going to secure the secondary evaporator.
Jim, are you - You're not using the computer now, are you?
It can go.
Can I use a Verb 83?
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, I want to jettison the covers.
Now, I'll unstow the cameras.
I keep looking around here; I won't see it again. We've got a Madaga - What's this coming up? Madagascar or what?
Yeah.
Okay.
Buzz has my eye patch.
Okay, Evap's going Off.
Secondary Pump, going Off.
ECS indicator's Primary.
You got the redundant components checked, Bill?
Checked, and we passed.
You got the fuel cells purge check?
Huh?
Does the fuel cell purge...
I haven't got that yet.
We should be getting - getting over Tananarive.
You want to check me off here?
Yeah, I'd - I'd like to.
Okay, I've done EPS periodic verification.
Good enough. Alright.
ECS monitoring.
Alright.
SPS monitoring.
Okay.
ECS redundant components. I'm ready to go on fuel cell purge.
Purge line heater has been On. Stand by for a Master Alarm. Purging fuel cell 1, H2
That it?
Yeah.
O2.
Okay.
I didn't get a high too well...
Probably won't H2, stand by.
Yep.
Okay. Okay.
How's Verb 83 looking?
That it?
Perfect.
Fuel cell 3...
Ooooh!
Stand by.
Okay. Okay.
Drinking water supply is On.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
I'll unstow the covered cameras here, but first let me get the dust covers jettisoned. Okay?
Okay.
Purge - purge check is complete, fuel cell line heaters are Off.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Reading you weak but clear. How me?
You're loud and clear, Mike. Everything seems to be going very well.
Okay. Everything looks real good here on the ground with both vehicles. We still have you 103 by 99 on your orbit from my low speed data, and everything is looking very good. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
G&N Optics Power, going On.
Well, do you want me to get out of Verb 83?
No, you are okay.
When are you going to unstow the camera?
As soon as I get this thing done.
Okay, Optics Coupling, Direct - Direct - The speed in High. Okay, here we go, gentlemen.
I'm not going to look into them for a while.
Okay, one minute.
I still think it's still kind of chilly in here.
They off, Jim?
Yeah, I guess so. Oh, I see a whole bunch of stuff - Oh, here we go.
They both Off?
Yes, I - I guess I was just looking at the...
It's blacker than pitch out there, remember.
Boy, every time I - Why? Is it dark out?
Yeah, you're looking up into pretty much blackness.
Every time I move the thing, I got a whole bunch of - of sparks, or you know, not sparks, but...
Did they go?
I guess, I can't see...
If you can see the glitter, you got - you've got it.
Turn the lights down?
Where's the other camera bracket, I wonder?
I don't know; I've always expected that other one to come out of there.
Listen, don't we have a stowage list in the back of the checklist?
That's what I am looking for, but I can't find it.
Okay, can I go into a 16 91?
Yes. Go back to POO first, Jim.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll just skip that. Proceed.
Do you have Tananarive?
Yes, we had them when we took the film.
Did Jim doublecheck to make sure that wasn't in there?
What's that?
That other camera bracket.
No, I haven't doublechecked yet.
I don't see anything...
We can handle that.
What did you say, Jim?
I don't see anything in the sextant.
You don't?
No.
Now this thing's all the way
I heard something then.
I'm flipping switches, and...
I thought I'd see something in the sextant.
Can you see out of the telescope?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I sure do.
Why don't you see if we can get the camera stuff unstowed before you go into darkness?
Okay.
Those cameras and that other junk.
I - I see something in here. I thought maybe I could maybe get it into the sextant to see better.
You're going to be doing that alignment, that P52.
Well, okay. I'm just doublechecking.
I think I see something floating.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. We have 1 minute to LOS Tananarive; we'll see you again over Carnarvon at 52:09. Over.
Roger. We do have the optics covers jettisoned, and everything seems to be going fine.
Roger. Optics cover jettisoned. Thank you.
Okay. B3 is what I have right here.
Okay. You want the 16-millimeter camera, right?
Yeah, here.
Right now; I'll just give you all these little goodies right now.
Okay, if Frank can hold it and hand it up to me
What do you want?
The 16-millimeter camera and the 18-millimeter lens?
Okay, this is the 16-millimeter camera. You got the right kind of film in there? C-EX, ASA sixty...
C-EX? That right?
Jim, you can head underneath and get that spotmeter.
Okay.
18-millimeter lens, and you need a mirror?
Yeah, I guess.
Huh?
Yeah, but I don't - I'm not sure it's going to fit on this - on this bracket here. I don't think it will.
Where have we got the spotmeter located here?
Right in here. Can I help you with it?
Way under there?
And is this the 75-millimeter magazine camera you want here?
That's all I can get now.
Do you see it in there, Jim?
No, I'll look for it. I - I might see it if I kind of look for it.
Can you hang on to that one for a second, Frank? Okay, we've got the...
Yeah, here it comes up here.
Alright.
Which way?
This way; to your right. Anything else down here?
Nope.
We need that other camera bracket. Let's put this one back.
We sure do.
How about going into your - into the stowage list and find out where it is. I haven't...
I can't seem to find the stowage list, either.
Maybe that's in your section.
It's in the Flight Plan.
No, this one won't work. We're going to have to use the other one.
What one won't work?
This camera bracket.
Oh.
Maybe you want to put the - This is all you need right here now, isn't it, Bill? You want to put that back? Here, I'll hold your checklist.
I thought we had one of those stowage lists in the back of your checklist.
Okay. I need camera number 2 with a 80-millimeter lens and some C film in it.
You've got it, haven't you?
Camera 2, magazine A, C film; right here.
Coming up on darkness.
Yes, Jim, you'd better start getting ready for the first eclipse.
Okay.
You couldn't check that camera bracket real quick, Jim?
I'll look in here.
Okay.
70-millimeter camera; you got all that. You got the spotmeter too, please, Bill?
I do. I've got everything I need except that bracket. This is a good enough place to keep it.
Do you need your checklist, Jim? Here I'll give it back.
Well, I'll be darned.
Wait a minute.
Thank you.
Well, it doesn't make it that far for TLI.
Okay, we're right up there.
How are we doing?
We're doing fine. We should be getting there. All we need is that other camera bracket.
I'm warm now. How about you?
I'm hot.
Man, I'm cold still.
Boy, is this. Hey, don't let me forget about this camera, when we light off here. It's spread all over the place.
Hey, that's right.
I hope I can see something out of here soon.
How's the cabin pressure?
It has kind of eased down a little bit.
What are you doing, Jim?
I'm okay. I'm just getting this all put together here.
Do you want me to read off anything to you - from the checklist? From a checklist, maybe?
I've got the P52 realign. You might kind of doublecheck me on it; maybe - I'm here and I'm going to turn down the floodlights and get - get my eye adapted here, because I don't see schmatz out there right now.
Hope it hasn't clouded up.
Frank, I sure hope you're right.
Alright, CM - do not key Verb 82. Do you want to go - start right from scratch with P00?
Yeah, okay. I'm going to bring this optics toward zero.
CMC, On; ISS is On; PSS is - SCS is operating; BMAGs, three, are Rate 2 - G&N Power Optics, On? Jim?
G&N Power Optics are On.
CMC is Free; Optics Mode, Zero.
Okay, stand by. I am going to go - I'm driving it to zero.
Uh-oh, the trunnion won't go any farther than - 45, and...
Need the lights down a little bit, Jim?
Now, it's just SCS. Okay, I can see. Okay, I'm going to go to zero. I don't think - It must be going to zero.
Okay, that looks good. Okay, I think I see something out there now.
You got the Optics Mode to zero?
Yeah.
Optic Mode, CMC.
Optic Mode, CMC.
What are you doing now?
Okay, I'll go - I'll go to P00 right now.
That's what you get with the burn.
Okay.
And by the way, we used Verb 66 at the end of our burn.
We did?
That's affirmative.
Hey, are you going to 52, now?
Well, are we dark or light out there?
Well, you ought to be able to get it even in light. It's getting dark now.
Okay. Well, I want to make sure we got a good one.
Okay, Verb 37, Enter; 52, Enter. You want a REFSMMAT option?
Verb 22, Enter; 3, Enter...
There's a couple of nice stars out here.
Enter. Okay. All set, gentlemen?
Yeah.
Hey, there's a bunch of stuff flying off this thing.
I know; that's what I was afraid of.
Real bright - I wonder why they're so bright?
The Sun's shining.
Are we - We're boiling?
Is the sun shining, really?
Yeah, look here, I got sun in it.
Oh Christ, I thought it was night time over here!
I can see a lot of stars over on this side.
What are you doing, Jim?
Well, I'm getting the optics adjusted here.
Yeah, they make you...
Okay, 06; 06 is what? 06 is Acamar. Worst star in the world for me to look at! Oh, I'm getting more stars now.
Okay, here we go, gentlemen.
You got a real bright star...
Zero off, right?
Yes.
Real bright star - star like...
Zero off.
CMC; Optic mode should be CMC.
CMC? Oh, to C, huh?
Holy cow!
Any luck?
Well, it stopped by a star. The star's out, but I don't know what it is, though.
Can you see it through the telescope?
Yeah. It seems to look like - Okay, I'm going to go to Resolve - Low, and Manual.
CMC; proceed; Spica's the one I want; proceed; okay; 15, that's Sirius.
We there yet?
Yes, proceeding.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8. You're loud and clear.
Rog. You're loud and clear over Carnarvon. We'd like to take DSE away from you for a second.
Go.
Roger. Go ahead.
Thank you.
Lots of lights down there.
Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Houston here, Apollo 8. Go ahead.
Roger. The torquing angle's: 00026; that's plus 00026, plus 00035, plus 00119.
Roger, Houston - Apollo 8, Houston. And copy plus 00026, plus 00035, plus 00119.
Roger. We checked on stars 6 and 15, and the error was plus 00001.
Sounds pretty good.
Pretty good for a beginner here.
Rog.
Apollo 8, Houston. We have about 1 minute to LOS Carnarvon. Everything is looking good with both the spacecraft and the S-IVB. We'll see you over Honeysuckle Creek at 59:27 - just here shortly.
Thank you.
Hello, Houston. Apollo 8. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Apollo 8. Houston here.
How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Reading you loud and clear, Bill. How me?
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8 on S-band. If you read, everything is Go.
Roger. Understand, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear.
We're reading you loud and clear also, Bill. The problem here over Honeysuckle has been on the ground. Your spacecraft equipment is all working fine. We're going to have LOS in about a minute, and we'll pick you up over Guaymas at 01:28:13. Over.
Roger. 01:28:13; thank you.
Roger.
We're giving the DSE back to you, Apollo 8.
Roger. Thank you.
Okay, what I can do is put this camera bracket. How about putting it in your temporary stowage bag, Bill?
Whatever you want. Has anybody seen the - Oh, there it is.
Okay, who's got - You got my TLI checklist, don't you, Bill? Or Frank? Oh, I got it. Now, everyone a Flight Plan out?
Okay,.
Or do you want to wait until after TLI?
Okay, S-band volume, down. I'm doing - I'm doing the - the - this check.
That booster was quite a ride. I'm still impressed.
I was a little worried at that pogo there on the second stage - something we didn't expect.
Anyone want me down here for anything else?
Well, I'm going to get prepared to get back in.
You going to get that data up?
You want the data now, or do you want to do the TLI checklist?
Data box.
You want the data box now, or do you want to wait to TLI?
be happy. He didn't have the systems book manual.
We ought to get those cards, too, Jim.
Well, I hate to keep all these hoses around here after TLI.
Okay. A 5-degree difference between...
You mean you need it again?
Not unless you went to.
Now, let me see. I don't know whether we need these lights on or not.
Let me have 4-B in the System Test, will you, Jim?
4-B?
Yes, roughly.
Okay.
You can go ahead and turn it Off.
You want to hand me that metal box, Jim, as soon as you finish?
It will be a lot more convenient when we can all get undone.
Yes, you want it?
Not really, but.
Gentlemen.
biomed around me. They've been looking at me all the time.
Would you believe that I think I see little gullies here?
Huh?
Where do we go, to the Center or what? Must be somebody else.
Maybe they didn't want the - Where's the.
They had me for the whole preflight.
You're not going to be able to write on that dump list, are you?
Well, we'll see.
Hey, you got that metal box?
Coming.
You got a down there.
Well, that's a problem, I can't help that.
Don't look at me on that.
You beginning to see a little horizon against the Moon there?
Yes, you can see that. It would be good if we had that for retro, wouldn't it? Entry, I mean. The thing is, we.
You want to make any comments about the boost part, if you get time to do it?
Okay.
Make them good and loud and clear; make sure everything's...
Are we on there now?
Yep.
Alright, the boost...
Metal box.
Stand by.
I can't see where this thing goes in down there. You'll have to help me, Jim. You got a flashlight?
Here you go.
I can't get it, but I think it's supposed to fit the bottom one here. Okay.
Down below?
Yeah. Down here. See? I - that thing fits in underneath here and I can't...
I'll put my feet over here.
We'll get those little things to stick in those rings down there. You see what I mean?
I can't get down there, yet. I don't know where I am.
Okay, where are we?
Those little holes in the - those little things that - see the holes into the wall?
Is it over here?
No, no, right...
Oh, it's over here. Okay.
No, it should be right...
I got one. Right here. Twist a little bit.
Okay.
There's one. Now let's get the other one.
Oh, shoot!
What was that?
My life jacket.
No kidding?
It hooked on the tank here. It flicked up.
Is it blowing up?
It's too early.
Why don't you take it off and give it to me, and I'll try to take it apart while you watch the panel.
Lovell just caught his life vest on Frank's strut.
It's hard to get off, too.
That's CO in there?
Yes, CO2
CO2
Yes. I think we ought to just leave the life vest just the way it is.
Tell you what we'll do: we'll dump it out with the vacuum cleaner over the side there, why don't we.
Put it right back here;
Okay.
Hey, that power looks low.
Yes, turn it off, Jim.
Okay,...
Why don't you put it up in the spout?
I'm afraid I'm going damage.
Okay, when we get communications again, we'll ask them what to...
Yes, we - we can live with a little CO2.
Where are you going, Jim?
Well, you want me to get this box, don't you?
Yeah.
Hey. Jim. When I heard that noise, I looked at the Cabin Pressure real quick!
Well, I knew what was wrong as soon as it happened!
I'm just kind of thankful, too.
Okay, gentlemen. I think we'll - I don't know - There's one thing I'm worried about: this helmet.
Where is it?
It's right up here.
Can't you stick it right here?
Is there room back there?
I could tie it a little bit.
Can you give me those, Jim?
What's that knock?
The clock?
When I raised my head back, I hit it with this.
I think I heard this firing over here.
How are we as far as the...
We're in good shape. I'm standing by for the backup comm check.
Hey, can I put this on the tape about this launch?
Yes, it would be a good time to do it.
Okay, the launch was nominal in almost every respect. It was no difficulty determining lift-off. Vibrations noticed before the thrust came up to - up to - well, before mainstage commit launch - commit to launch, and then at - when the hold-down arms released, the vibration went away. There was a lot of noise initially in the cabin. It was difficult to communicate. And then as we - The noise died out, we approached Max-Q, when it built back up again. There was no pogo noticeable on the I-C stage. The stagings, to be frank, were all nominal. The only off-nominal factor the whole launch worth mentioning was the slight pogo that was recorded in real time on the S-II stage, and the loud - the audio level inside the - inside the cabin during S-IC burn.
Didn't you - didn't you think the thing was still rattling like a freight train before you - as you became clear of the tower? I had the feeling that it was.
No, I thought - when we let go...
Yes, you could tell it let go, but I meant I thought it kept vibrating. You might make a note that was at 1 hour and 16 minutes if you ever want to find your tape when you debrief.
Alright.
Well, I guess I could tie it up - here. Let's ask him.
Don't tie it on that hatch thing there.
Not the hatch handle. There's a hatch...
Okay, what's the g; one g?
One (laughter) - one g; are you kidding?
I mean - during the booster period.
Yes, a little over one g.
You want to hand out - Well, I guess we won't need a Flight Plan. No.
The camera; configured for the backup comm check; checked my two circuit breakers.
What time is it? We ought to keep track of the time.
Okay.
I got plenty of time to get back in the couch. Okay, where are the...
The primary transponder's going Off for 4 seconds.
Okay, where are the - the - the headpads?
Secondary transponder's coming On.
The what, Jim?
You want the headpads, don't you?
Well, not yet. Let's wait until we - Oh, you mean before the boost?
They're in that CO2 thing.
They're going to be awful hard to put on; I know that.
I think that's them; I'm not sure.
And also doing a down-voice backup, and up-voice backup
That's down; that's down.
Life preserver is - just floating.
Well, that's.
I'm putting tape over these transponder switches.
Sunrise coming up.
How are the fuel cells looking?
Secondary looks okay. It reads a little higher than the rest of them. One, even before launch, showed a little bit lower O2 flow than H2. Okay.
You going to put your shoulder harness on again?
I never took mine off. Yeah, how do you take them off?
Well, just kind of I just kind of loosened my belt, there at the fastener.
I don't know what we'll do with that damn life vest. There's no way we can.
Yeah, you can...
Yeah, with the thing you blow it up with.
It sure is nice to get that helmet and gloves off.
It sure was.
You're recording.
Wait a minute. Before you get back to the seat, you're supposed to turn the - You're not back in your seat for good, are you? We got a long time.
Before - Oh, we got 2 hours and 20 minutes now.
Yeah.
Okay, I'll go back down.
Gee, this is the best flight I ever had.
Because you've got to get those circuit breakers before up here.
Yeah.
You know, this is very clean.
Here comes the Sun.
Well, take a look. It crept up on us.
I think we'll feel better when we close this. See that?
Yeah.
Although I noticed it was pretty good, whenever we were over...
Sunrise at 01:25.
Alright now, would you say we lifted off on time, gentlemen?
I'd say we did.
There for a while though, when we were counting down there for the last seconds, I didn't think she was going to wait.
Yeah.
Are the safety boilers still going?
Yes, sir.
That's one thing else we should note about the launch. That we didn't hear the noise until about 3 seconds before lift-off, even though ignition commit the main came on time.
And the tower jettison was quite noticeable. Although it wasn't the rumble you get in the DCPS.
You want to say anything else, Bill, that you're working at?
Bill - or Jim, how about taking the ECS check?
She has been a little bit lower than normal.
Well, we could be.
Yeah.
I'm not too in favor of this attitude as far as - Hey, we've been doing an awful lot of upside down flying.
You can't see any other way.
Can't you see the horizon?
Can you see the horizon?
Yeah. I just couldn't the other way.
I guess maybe this is not the - No, wait a second, all I see is.
Yeah, there's some dust out there due to the...
Yeah, you ought to give them a little blob on the...
Let's give them a window status report as far as contamination.
Okay. We want to keep charts from right to left here.
Alright. Number 1 window is clean and has lint on it, and then toward the upper part, that's plus-X on the outside pane, it looks like we're already starting to form bits of frost. There was not any evidence of contamination there during staging. Number 2 rendezvous window is good with some, again, specks of lint hanging off the.
Apollo 8. Houston. Over.
Number 3 window has some dust on it, and in the lower - in the lower right-hand corner, there is a smudge on what appears to be the outside pane - I'm not too sure it's not the inside; but the visibility appears to be real good...
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over. (No answer.)
But you're never going to be recording there. You've got to talk real loud.
Oh, he can't?
Okay. There's a little smudge on the lower left-hand portion of the center window, and some dust on both the outside and the inside windows, but the visibility is still very good.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Window number - window number 4 is clear. Window number 5 appears clear, but it's in the shadow at the moment, and it's difficult to tell if there's any frost forming at this point.
Okay, very good.
Okay, now let's check to see if we're receiving good.
This is backup comm check?
Yeah,.

Very good. That's all correct, and I have a TLI PAD for you whenever you're ready to copy it.
Ready to copy.
Okay. Your computer PAD is in and verified. You can go to Block, and we're going to have LOS here in about 45 seconds. I'll start on the TLI PAD anyway. Time base 6 p, 2:41:36; roll, 179; pitch, 045; yaw, 001; burn time, 5 plus 15; Delta VC prime, 10519.6; VI 35569; roll, 357; pitch, 091; yaw, 001.

Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 8. Reading you loud and clear. TLI planned 2:41:36; 179, 045, 001; 5:15 10519.6, 35569; 357, 091, 001; TLI plus 10, abort attitude 199 on the pitch.
Roger, Apollo 8. That is correct. We'd like to double check one number on the TLI plus 90 minutes. When you can dig that out, let me know.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. It's - the sextant shaft angle should be 202.7. Over.
Roger. Sextant shaft is 202.7.
Thank you, sir.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. S-IVB looking good, both from a guidance and a consumable viewpoint; it all looks Go.
Roger.
The DSE is all yours, Bill.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. We will have LOS in 1 minute; we'll pick you up again over Tananarive at 02:09.
Roger, Michael. Thank you.
Roger. How does it feel up there?
Very good, very good. Everything is going rather well. It looks just about the same way it did 3 years ago.
Has Bill got time from playing with his tape recorder to look out the window?
Roger. We had one little incident here. Jim Lovell inadvertently popped one life raft, so we've got one full Mae West with us here.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston through Tananarive. Over.
Roger. Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Roger, Apollo 8. We don't have anything for you; we are just standing by. You're looking good.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Gemini 8 - correction: Apollo 8.
Roger. Gemini 8, Houston. We'd like to bring you up to date on the comm situation while we've got some quiet time here. We'll be LOS Tananarive in another 2 minutes; we'll be picking you up over Carnarvon at 2 hours, 25 minutes and 22 seconds. LOS Carnarvon will be 02:31:55; then we've got ARIA number 1 coming in at about 02:37:30; and after that, we have a hand-off to Mercury to Hawaii to Goldstone, and we should have continuous comm. Over.
Very good. That's very good. Thank you.
Rog.
Thought you were Gemini 7, not 8.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo.
Roger. Loud and clear. We'd like to take your tape recorder for a minute, please.
Can he have it, Bill?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
By the way, we read out the voice tape, and the quality of the voice tape is good - from the DSE.
Good.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8. You are Go for TLI. Over.
Roger. We understand; we are Go for TLI.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. We'll have LOS in about 30 seconds, and we'll pick you up over ARIA 1 at 02:37 and a half.
Roger.
Houston. This is Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. I hear you garbled but fairly clear.
Roger. Apollo 8, Houston. We're transmitting through ARIA 1, and you are also garbled.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Good; you're loud and clear through the Mercury, and you're looking good down here. Everything looks good.
Roger. Understand. Our O2 flow is a little bit higher than I thought, but Bill says that it's just about what he expected.
Rog. Understand.
Your O2 flow looks good down here.
Thank you.
Okay. Start your watch see what time it says.
Apollo 8, Houston. You're looking good.
Roger.
Huh?
Call out the time, Frank.
59:17, 18.
Okay, 42 is S-II Sep light, Off.
42?
Okay, you're in EMS Mode, Auto?
Yeah.
Okay.
Apollo 8, coming up on 20 seconds to ignition. Mark it, and you're looking very good.
Okay.
Roger.
Call 42.
We're past 42. That was when our light...
That's 58:42 or - 59...
59...
Ignition.
Roger. Ignition.
Go ahead. Boy, it's going off in yaw.
Okay, the DAP is fine over here.
What's your attitude at?
Fine, 45.
Okay.
Okay, align yourself in attitude, we got plus or minus 5 degrees.
And the tank pressures?
Tank pressures are good.
Okay.
Are you watching the Delta-P?
Yeah.
30 seconds.
Apollo 8, Houston. You're looking good.
You got 18 hours to...
Don't worry about that.
Everything alright?
60 seconds.
20 seconds off.
Things are looking good over here.
Apollo 8, Houston. Trajectory and guidance look good. Over.
Roger. Apollo 8, looks good here.
Okay, cut-off at 02:55:51. Okay, we're coming up on 28,000 (fps).
Apollo 8, Houston. We're predicting cut-off, 02:55:58, and it looks exactly nominal here.
Roger.
02:55:58?
Right.
Apollo 8, Houston. That predicted cut-off, 02:55:52, 52, and that's exactly as it should be.
02:55:52.
Okay.
Shouldn't have that goddamn high flow rate up there.
Coming up on 29,000. Okay, our yaw should be coming off now a little bit.
3 minutes to go.
You should have about 8 degrees of yaw yet, compared to what - 35? A weak 35, now 37. Alright, it was what - 9 degrees?
Hey, that O2 is pegged high, Bill.
Yes, I know. It's just a little warmer up here. I'd - I'm looking at the Delta-P here. The surge tank in the tank 1 nothing else to worry about.
30,000.
Apollo 8, Houston. You are looking good here, right down the center line.
Roger. Apollo 8.
Coming up on 31,000.
How's the cabin pressure, Bill?
Holding good.
Coming up on 31,5.
02:54.
What time?
02:54:56.
02:55:52.
One minute to go.
Apollo 8. Houston. You're looking good, right down the old center line.
Roger. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8...
Stand by.
30 seconds to go. 34,000. You got the card?
Yeah.
Did you see the card, Bill?
I got it.
Okay.
35,000. We should have good.
Alright, 15 coming up here.
Real fine. 10 seconds.
35 - 35,1.
How's your inertial velocity?
Velocity's looking fine.
5, 4...
Okay. We got SECO right on the money.
Roger. Understand; SECO.
I got a light; 2 seconds late on SECO. got the tape recorder.
SECO gimbal.
Jim. Go ahead, Bill.
SECO plus 10 seconds, light Off. S-IVB goes to attitude hold 20 seconds and begin venting.
Okay.
