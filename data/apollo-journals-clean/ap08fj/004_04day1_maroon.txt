Houston. Apollo 8. [No answer.]
Houston. Apollo 8. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Did you call?
Roger. There is the High Gain Antenna on Wide, Auto.
Roger
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Are you getting the results you want from our High Gain Antenna? [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Affirmative. We are getting your data, and we may have a beamwidth change but stand by on that.
Alright. We're standing by. Jim's about ready to go back to the P23s.
Roger. We have a Go until 7 hours on the start of the PTC.
Roger. Seven. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
We're in a PTC mode now waiting for Jim, and I noticed that out my window now I can see Orion very clearly, even though the win - the Sun is bright in the other window.
Roger.
It almost pained me to say that, but it's true.
Rog.
Speaking of the windows, the number 5 window is getting pretty well obscured and the number 3 window is unusable.
Roger. Understand; number 3 is unusable and number 5 is obscured. Can you make out any definition at all, or do you have a target to look at?
Well, I can see the Sun. Wait till it comes around the Earth, and I'll give you a better hack on that.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We're going to go ahead and try to dump your tape right now. The circuit margins aren't too good at our present configuration. We're going to take a look at it. If it doesn't work, we may have to dump it again at a later configuration.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. We're maneuvering back now to do another P23.
Roger. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is Apollo 8. I'll do two more sets on [star] 15, and then we'll do one set on [star] 16.
Rog. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay, Apollo 8. I'd like to fill you in on things we're thinking about doing in the next couple of hours, first chance you get there.
Go ahead.
Okay. In relationship to the midcourse correction, we'd like to put that one off until about 11 hours, and it'll be approximately a 25-foot-per-second burn. The reason we're delaying the burn time is to allow for better tracking as a result of the 7½-foot-per-second you put in on the separation. Why, we'd like to take little more time to look at the tracking data. And the dispersions in your correction aren't going to be growing very fast here. What we'll do then is to delete the Nav sightings that occur about 09 plus 10 in the Flight Plan, and this will be getting us back on to the normal Flight Plan sequence. So we'll go ahead and finish the P23, and the 7-hour limit on that P23 is due to the range limits on this test. Over.
Is due to the what, you say?
The 7 hours on the P23 problem is due to the fact that we want to get these sightings in at a certain range. Over.
Roger. Understand.
If you have any comments on that proposal, why, go ahead and pass them down, and we'll feed them in.
No. I think that's fine. We need to get out of the suits and get something to eat here too.
Rog. Looks like we'll be back on the Flight Plan by 11 hours. We'll be holding up on the updates and PADs because of the later burn.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. I believe we have the S-IVB in sight. It's - it would appear to be tumbling, and every once in a while, we are getting very bright reflections from it off the star - off the Sun.
Rog.
Houston, 8. Are you getting the data from the P23?
Stand by one.
Affirmative. Apollo 8.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Rog. We're copying your P23 progress, and FAO advises that it looks like you are finishing your first star, and we'll need one more set on the second star, and this 7-hour cut-off isn't that firm, so we'd like for you to go ahead and complete the second star if you can. And...
We're on the last setting of the second star right now.
Okay. Real fine. And we've got a - it's about time for a cryo fan cycle.
Okay. We'll do them one at the time for about 4 minutes on each of them.
Rog. [Long pause.]
We've got the cryo fan on in H2 tank number 1.
Rog, Bill.
Houston, Apollo 8. We've just got finished taking two sets, six sightings on Sirius, and one set [three sightings] on Procyon.
Roger. Understand that's six on Sirius and one on Procyon.
Two sets on Sirius, one set on Procyon.
Roger. [Long pause.]
And we're maneuvering now to PTC attitude.
Oh. Roger, Apollo 8. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, when you get a chance down in the Lower Equipment Bay, it looks like you're using the floodlights in the Dim 2 position, and that one is a time-limited item. We'd like for you to do your standard running in the Dim 1 position. Over.
Roger. Just turned them off.
Okay. Any time you have them on, running Dim 1 position is preferred for the LEB.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Houston. We have the cryo fan on - the number 1 H2 tank was on at 07:01. You can give us a hack when you want it - when you're ready for it to be turned off.
Wilco. [Pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8. You can terminate that one and go to the other tank.
Roger. [Pause.]
Okay. H2 number 2 is On.
Rog.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Are you having any problem on the ground with your comm?
Negative. You're coming in loud and clear.
Okay. We seem to be breaking lock intermittently up here once in a while.
Rog. We'll keep our eye on it. It sounds good though.
Okay. Houston, Apollo 8. We've initiated the PTC.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay. Apollo 8, you can terminate the fans in the hydrogen, and we're ready to start on the oxygen tanks.
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 8, we're through with the dump; you can have the tape recorder back.
Roger, thank You.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're ready to go to the [stirring of the] second O2 tank.
Okay.
And for your information, it's Cleveland 24 to 10, and what we plan to do...
Say again.
That's Cleveland 24 to 10, not over yet. [Pause.]
Thank you.
Okay, Apollo 8. Looks like you can terminate your cryo fans now, and we're going to leave you alone for a while. Let you get caught up. Things we have on board; the High Gain Antenna check - comm mode check that you have listed at 7 hours, we'll put off and do whenever you are ready for it. So that's at your convenience. During the High Gain dump that we performed using the wide band, we were still getting real good data at 36K, which is a little bit further than circuit margins that were predicted for you. And we've got our SPS [Service Propulsion System] burn coming up somewhere around 11 hours, and we'll give you more information on that later.
Roger.
We're doing the program 21 now, determining ground track for LOI that we did not make at 5 hours.
Rog. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Okay. We just broke lock on S-band High Gain. We're on Omni D now.
Roger. Omni B. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Is that Bravo or Delta?
Dog. Delta.
Rog.
We can't get the Program 21 to integrate up to LOI. It just stalled out around 61 hours and 2 minutes.
Guidance.
Rog. They're watching. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. Do you want us to stop the integration via Verb 96? Over.
That is affirmative; Verb 96.
Roger. Will do.
Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Rog. Do you want us to hold off on this P52 realignment, also?
Yeah, that's affirmative, CapCom. We want to do that a couple of hours when it is related to the maneuver, midcourse.
That's affirmative, Apollo 8. That's tied to the maneuver and we will hold off and do that all in normal pre-maneuver sequence. And - We have got a score here [in the Cleveland-Dallas football game] - in the fourth quarter, 31 to 13. And I've got some words on your P21 discrepancy any time you're interested. And I'd like to confirm...
Go ahead.
Okay. Before I get off on that one, I'd like to confirm that you use the Verb 37 procedure to go to P00.
Roger.
Okay. On P21, the thinking runs that you had a slight error in your state vector at the time you started, and when that was integrated out, it intercepted the lunar surface where it locked up and this is contained in a fairly recent program note.
Okay. Now, we've closed the - the waste vent, so we should see this O2 come down now.
Okay. Understand you closed the waste vent, and how about the lithium change? Have you done that one?
Roger. That's done.
Okay. Thank you.
EECOM, Flight. Did you copy that?
This conference communication is great. We won't have to have any debriefing.
[Laughter] That's pretty outstanding.
Right. [Pause.]
Did you copy that?
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. With the delay in burn, do you mind if we have a urine dump the - before the burn? Will that foul your tracking up?
Okay. Standby. Let me run that one by. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We don't have any objections to going ahead with the urine dump now. And for your information, the waste water dump - our schedule, we plan to put it off until about 11:30, and this will get you up to approximately 90 percent in your waste tank. It's a little higher than normal, but we wanted to put this off until after the burn was completed.
Cleveland over Dallas, huh?
How about that? [Pause.]
Houston, how do the circuit margins on the S-band look as compared to your pre-flight calculations? [Long pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8. It's a little bit early to give you any real numbers on your comm performance. Looks like it's working as good as predicted, and everything else seems to be doing better, so this may be doing better, too. After we've done our next comm checks and some of these other things, we'll have a better hack on it; I can give you a quantitative answer to your question.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Apollo 8.
Roger. Sure got a nice view of the Earth from here. We can see Baja California and about where San Diego ought to be.
Very good.
I can't see my dad's flag pole, out there today, though.
We'll tell the doctors about that.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We dropped off of High Gain on the Omni there for a bit and went to a low bit rate, and we're getting ready to command you back to high bit rate. Do you want us to keep you posted every time we change tape speeds?
We're not recording now anyway, Houston.
Rog. Understand; but when we go to high bit rate, do you want to be kept informed every time we transfer? We hadn't planned on it.
If we think if we need to record, we'll ask you on that deal.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. How does your tracking look on us?
FIDO, Flight. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, tracking still in progress and a little too soon to give you a firm answer on the results, but everything looks nominal so far.
Is it working okay?
Seems to be.
Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Okay. Sometime when it's convenient for you now, I would like to see an oxygen fuel cell purge. And do you have any estimate on when you might be getting around to this comm test?
Right now we're right in the middle of trying to get something to eat, Ken. We can - I guess we can do the fuel cell purge.
Okay, Apollo 8, there's no rush. Just didn't know what you were doing at the time and - Give us a call when you have a free moment; we'll pick up.
We can start the O2 purge now, if you wish.
Okay. That'd be fine, and I'll keep track of the time for you.
Okay. That'd be good. Now I'll turn on O2 now on fuel cell 1.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. That's about 2 minutes on your first fuel cell.
Roger. It's up, and number 2 is on now.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Houston. Go ahead.
While I'm waiting for my turn at the water gun, I might give some comments on the optics. There seems to be quite a band of light that goes all across the scanning telescope anywhere in the vicinity of the Sun. Just a little while ago we were in the position where I could pick up the Moon in the scanning telescope. And then I looked at it in the sextant and the sky - the space around the Moon was a very light blue, just about as light blue as we have it back on Earth. And it's not black - that Sun angle with the Moon.
Understand. This light blue was - showed up in the sextant.
That's affirmative. I maneuvered the optics so I could pick up the Moon in the sextant, and the - the space around the Moon is a light blue.
Rog. Can you make any kind of estimate about the proportion of the radius, how far out that seems to extend?
Well, it extends the full length of the sextant. Actually, I could see us coming as we moved across, because the band of light in the scanning telescope cut across where the Moon was, and it moved in this area. I believe it's caused by the refractional light inside the optics themselves.
Rog.
Also, I've been occasionally looking out to see if I could see stars at various Sun angles, and at this particular altitude, it's very difficult. In the scanning telescope the Sun is very bright and the Earth is very bright, And if I looked at the Earth and try to look for stars, I lose my dark adaptation very quickly.
Roger. Do you have any problem seeing the Moon?
No problem seeing the Moon. When I looked in the star/landmark line-of-sight, I - It's a very thin crescent, but it vas very visible.
Rog. Does the area illuminated in Earthshine show up?
Not at this altitude, and that's strange. I thought I could see that. At this altitude, the refraction of the light in the optics themselves, due to the reflection of the sunlight I suspect, or Earth's light, completely blanked out the dark side of the Moon to this altitude.
How about that.
Maybe we have an atmosphere around the Moon. [Long pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8. Looks like that ought to terminate the fuel cell purging.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Do you want to get started here around 10 hours? Is that what you said?
Well, what we had planned was to use the 10- to 11-hour period as your pre-burn preparation just as we would have done normally, and...
That's fine. We can go ahead and do that.
...and if you can work in this comm check before that, it would be desirable, but that's not a constraint.
What do you want in the way of a comm check, George?
Again, what do you want?
Okay. What we've got here is a couple of DTO [Detailed Test Objective] comm checks. We'll be switching around to five different modes, and only one of them will interrupt your activities. In that case, we'll be switching to the uplink backup voice, and that's the one time that you might lose temporary uplink voice comm. You'll have downlink voice comm throughout the entire procedure, and it ought to take you, I guess, 10 to 15 minutes max., the only requirement being that we should stay on a High Gain Antenna.
Why don't we go ahead and start now then?
Okay. That sounds pretty good.
...whenever.
Okay, Apollo 8. Another couple of minutes, we'll be ready to go into our - our comm check. And, for your information, looks like the signal strength is 3 to 4 dB better than expected on the wide range, on the wide beam mode, and approximately that gives you 1.4 increase in your range.
Roger. Let's not increase it by 1.4, though.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Something else you might take a look at, as you go through the PTC, we have some people who would like to know if you can see any detectable effect on the windows in the form of their fogging. Particularly, does the Sun seem to vary the fog intensity or does it increase it or decrease it or make it go in patches or anything like that that you might be able to notice?
The Sun doesn't seem to change it much; however, the different incidences of the Sun's rays magnify the - the fogging, or at least change it.
Okay, Apollo 8. I'm sorry. Would you say again, please?
The Sun doesn't seem to have any effect on the windows themselves, but the different incidence - angles of incidence of the Sun rays change the relative amount of obscuration caused by the fogging.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8. We're ready to go into the comm check now, and it's your option. We can call out the switches and let you position them, or we can command it from the ground. In either event, there'll be a couple of switches that you'll have to throw for us.
We'll have you command them, and we'll throw [the switches] what we have - what you want.
Okay. And I'll keep you posted on what we're doing. The first test is an uplink voice and ranging with full downlink voice which is essentially what you're doing right now, is to be used for a baseline.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay. We're starting on test number 1, and if you would verify that the S-band Normal mode switch is in Voice.
Roger. We're in Voice.
Okay.
[Garble] Charlie. [Pause.]
And the Up Telemetry Data to Data.
Roger. Data. [Long pause.]
Okay. And Up Telemetry Command to Normal.
Normal.
Roger. How about High Gain Antenna Track to Auto.
We're on Omni D now; we've got to wait 'til we get around the other way.
Okay. What's your estimate? [Pause.]
We're at 15 minutes from it.
Okay.
Maybe we'd better hold the comm check off till after the midcourse, because we'd better get started here at 10 [hours] if we want to burn at 9 [means 11 hours].
That's affirm. We're reviewing that right now.
... means we want to burn at eleven [hours].
Okay, Apollo 8. We're gonna postpone the comm test until after the burn.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. Are you ready to go - for us to go through with the P52 now?
That's negative, Apollo 8. We'd like to update things first, and we're going to give you a LM state vector and then an external Delta-V.
Roger.
And with P00 and Accept, why, we'll go ahead and work on that.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We've got your PADs. We're ready to read up to you. And we're standing by to uplink your state vector and external Delta-V whenever you're ready to give us Accept.
Roger. Just stand by one, and we'll get the PAD from you. [Pause.]
And we'll put it in TM [Telemetry] and Accept now - at this time.
Rog. [Long pause.]
We're ready to copy the PAD. [Pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8. I didn't copy that last one. We are sending your state vector up now.
Roger. We say we are ready to copy the PAD.
Okay. The first PAD will be a maneuver PAD, MCC-1: and this will be an SPS/G&N, beginning with the weight; 63295; minus 1.63, plus 1.29; 010:59:58.30; plus 0013.6, minus 0004.5, plus 0020.2; 345, 188, 343; 99999; plus 0168.5; 0024.8, 0:02, 0018.6; 23, 201.3, 16.4; 012, up 27.6, left 0.4; November Alpha for the remainder of that column. In the comments: north stars; 068, 097, 356; a no ullage start, and a single bank burn on bank Alpha. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. MCC-1 maneuvers: SPS/G&N; 63295; minus 1.63, plus 1.29; 010:59;58.30; plus 0013.6, minus 0004.5, plus 0020.2; 345, 188, 343; all 9's; plus 0168.5; 0024.8, 0:02, 0018.6; 23, 201.3, 16.4; 012, up 27.6, left 0.4; November Alpha for the remainder. North set stars; roll, 068; pitch, 097; yaw, 356; no ullage, single bank - bank Alpha.
Roger, Apollo 8. That's correct. And I have a TLI plus - 11 PAD for you. [Long pause.]
Roger. Go ahead. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. Go ahead.
Roger, Apollo 8. Loud and clear now. Are you ready to copy?
Roger. Ready to copy.
Okay. This is a TLI plus 11, SPS/G&N. This assumes a midcourse correction number 1: 63140; minus 1.63, plus 1.29; 013:56:48.97; minus 0059.9, plus 00000, plus 4701.6; 177, 143, 000; November Alpha, plus 0019.7; 4702.0, 5:51, 4681.8; 12, 128.3, 25.7; 023, up 26.3, left 1.7; plus 11.95, minus 165.00; 1268.3, 35608, 050:47:05; north stars; 068, 097, 356; no ullage. For the fast return P37 Delta-V, 7900 for the Indian Ocean, high speed procedure not required for the MS. This assumes midcourse correction 1. Over.
Stand by.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. For the readback, are you ready?
Go ahead.
TLI plus 11; SPS/G&N; 63140; minus 1.63, plus 1.29; 13:56:48.97; minus 0059.9, plus 00000, and I believe it's plus 4701.6.
Affirmative. [Pause.]
177, 143, 000; N/A, plus 0019.7; 4702.0, 5:51, 4681.8; 12, 128.3, 25.7; 023, up 26.3, left 1.7; plus 11.95, minus 165.00; plus 1262.3, 35608, 050:47:05. [Pause.] The north set; roll, 68; pitch, 97; yaw, 356; no ullage, P37 high speed, 7900 Indian Ocean, and high speed procedures for the MS are not required; assumed MCC-1.
Roger, Apollo 8. Two corrections on the GETI. The hour's 013. Range to go EMS.
013.
Roger. Copy that and the range-to-go in the EMS 1268.3. Over.
1268.3.
That's correct.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. Be advised that we doubted that it would be possible to use the stars to get our backup alignment. We haven't been able to see any stars through the scanning telescope yet.
Roger. [Pause.]
Okay. And another comment for you, Apollo 8; like for you to use Verb 37 to select P00 and then wait for your computer activity light to go off prior to unzap of the LM NAV to CSM slots.
Roger. You ready for us to do that now?
That's affirm. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Okay. Now we'll go ahead and start back towards the Flight Plan around 8 hours here of P52, right?
That's affirm.
Well, we - we've transferred - wait - we've transferred the state vector to the LM slots already before we did a 52. So we're going to do the 52 now. [Pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8. That's good procedure and...
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Will you check your Up Telemetry switch to Block, please?
Thank you. It's in Block.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Well, no. We got to get a DAP load in here to make sure they check first, right? Okay? Okay, it's... You got the DAP to where you want it?
I'm going to get it right now.
Done P30?
We haven't done P30 yet.
That's right.
I know, but don't you want to do - Before you do P30, don't you want to look at the DAP?
No, no, that comes way down along the line.

Let's see, might as well have a countdown for this one, huh?
Yes.
Well, all our stuff is counting up though, isn't it?
I got mine; I can figure it - I've got 6 seconds to go or some - 6 minutes to go, 5 minutes to go either way, so you can suit yourself.
Why don't you count down? I can call it out to you.
Okay, we don't have too much time. We've got to get a boresight star and all that stuff, too.
Yeah, I know it.

[Garble] go to P00.
Okay, go to [P]40 now.
Okay, P40.
You know you ought to go to P00 to maneuver to the burn attitude.
Yeah, I will; I got it.

Verb 62, Enter; Verb 49, Enter.
Reset that for zero.
Verb 25, Enter; and it's 345 - 3, 4, 5...
No, that's wrong. You've got to have plus.
Alright, plus 34500, Enter; plus 188 - 1880, Enter; plus 34300, Enter. Okay. All set.
Go ahead.
Proceed?
Yeah.
Proceed. Proceed!
Proceed.
Wait a minute. Okay, you got SCS Auto and everything?
Huh?
You're all set, right?
Yeah, that's all it takes.
BMAGs...
Rate 2, you called that.
Okay then. You don't have any other.
We maneuvering?
Yeah.
Are we ever!
Which way you going?
Rolling right, and yawing left.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. We've got a telescope alignment if you'd like to give it a try. Your sextant star is still good, but if you had problems with that, folks have worked out that if you look through the telescope at 10:35, we have a shaft and trunnion that should point you at the center of the Earth, if you would like to give that one a try.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay. At 10:35...
[Talking over Mattingly] Write that down.
Okay, here, I got it.
Did you get that, Jim, there?
Roger. 10:35: shaft 006.2, trunnion 18.9.
That's affirmative.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We'd like to get a fan - a cryo fan cycle in here before the burn. About 1 minute on each should be fine.
Roger. I've already given 2 minutes on H2 1 and 2 and O2 1, and I've just started O2 2.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. We'd like to dump your tape prior to the burn.
Roger. It's only been running here about 15 minutes. [Long pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8. That's - that's correct. You're on high bit rate, and we're afraid you may run out before the burn, so we'd like to dump it, and give it back to you with a full load before the burn.
Roger. And give us a comment on the voice quality.
Wilco.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. We plan to stop charging battery B about another 5 minutes. You concur?
That's affirmative.
Okay. You might just remind us.
Wilco.
Apollo 8.
This is 8. Go ahead. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Houston. You were cut out.
Okay, Apollo 8. All your systems are Go, and we were about to tell you, you could go ahead and terminate the battery charge, and you beat us to the punch.
I read your mind, and it's showing 37 volts right now.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. If you'll go high bit rate, we'll give you a tape recorder back to your command. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. If you'll put your high bit rate on, we'll give you the tape recorder back.
Rog.
Houston, did you give us a tape back? Over. [Long pause.]
Affirmative, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8's Command Reset to get tape motion. We're now in Normal.
Roger.
You heard me, didn't you? I [garbled]. Not if you do a real quickly.
Coming up on 2 minutes.
Okay.
Okay, 2 minutes. Delta-V Thrust A, Normal.
Main Thrust, Normal.
Translational Hand Controller, Armed.
Armed.
Rotational Hand Controller, both, Armed.
Got yours?
Okay.
Tape recorder is Record, High bit rate, and Forward.
Okay, stand by for DSKY blanking.
Okay.
What happened to EMS, Auto? Bill?
30 seconds.
30 seconds.
Okay.
I don't see how Wally did this [garble].
What's that?
Hold these things down.
We hear you.
Apollo 8, stand by for a mark at 1 minute.
Roger. Apollo 8 standing by.
...Ten seconds [to the one minute mark].
Yes. Alright, I'll...
Five seconds.
2, 1...
Mark.
One minute.
Roger.
[Singing.]
Okay, at 30 seconds, get EMS Mode, Auto.
Right.
[Singing.]
Okay, DSKY should blank?
Blank.
EMS Mode, Auto; average g is On.
Check your PIPA bias.
No ullage.
No ullage, yeah.
Counting down.
What's that do?
Flight Recorder.
10, 9.
Enabled.
Stop. At 10:02, it has to be Off.
Okay, 10:02.
Okay.
Like a big spring.
Okay, have you gone forw...
Two balls off.
Okay, now.
Okay.
It's holding; let's go, let's go through the checklist.
Okay, okay, you got that; SPS Thrust light, On, Okay, Delta-V Thrust A, Off.
Off.
Okay, verify Thrust is Off. I verify it over here.
Right.
SPS Pitch and Yaw circuit breakers, Closed.
They're Closed.
Okay, turn them Off: Gimbal Motors.
1, Off.
Got it.
2, Off.
Got it.
3, Off.
Got it.
4, Off.
Got it.
Okay.
TVC Servo Power, 1 and 2, Off.
Off.
Flight Recorder's Off; Main Bus ties going Off.
Okay.
Okay, null residuals.
Okay, proceed. You've got your [garbled, probably referring to having the residual velocities to be gained displayed on the DSKY].
Proceed.
Got them? Do I null them?
Null residuals.
20.4.
That's an awful lot.
Yeah, I know it.
There you are.
Okay - Okay. Null residuals.... residuals are nulled.
Okay, record Delta-V Counter and residuals.
You can turn this off before...
I turned it off [garble].
EMS function, Off.
Off.
EMS Mode, Standby.
Standby.
BMAG Mode, three, Rate 2.
Rate 2.
Deadband, Max.
Deadband, Max.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. The burn time was on time - about 2 seconds; we had residual 4.4 in X. We burned it out to 0.2. Attitudes are nominal. The Delta-VC, before the residuals were taken out, was a minus 2.4. I have transferred the state vector to the LM slot in Verb 66.
Roger. Copy 4.4 for X and 2.4 on C. And negative residual on Y prior to the trim. Is that affirm?
That's affirmative, and we took out the 4.4 residual down to 0.2.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. Do you want us to start charging battery A, now?
Standby. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8. Let's go back to battery Bravo, and we'll finish that one off before we start in on Alpha.
Roger. Battery Bravo. [Pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. Do you want us to maneuver to any particular attitude for a water dump, or do you want us to go to PTC attitude?
Okay. Let's go PTC.
And give me the angles please. [Long pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8. Let's do the same angles we had before: that's pitch 242 and yaw 20 on the PTC attitude.
242; yaw, 20. Roger.
Houston, we're preparing to dump our waste water now.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead 8.
We've noticed on our system test battery vent pressure that when we opened the battery vent valve, we get an immediate drop-off to pressure which nulls out at about two-tenths of a - to three-tenths of a volt. And we think this is zero in the battery manifold. Do you concur?
Okay. Stand by. [Garble] stand by, and let's check it out.
Apollo 8, I cut you out there. What did you say on the last one?
It looks like probably the - that zero psi corresponds to about three-tenths of a volt on the test meter. We've had it happen a couple of times, where the pressure would drop rapidly to this setting, as if it was zero. Over.
Rog. We'll look at our data here and let you know what we see. Are you going ahead with the water dump now?
Roger. We'd - we're pausing here on the water dump, though, just to verify that the battery vent - the line is clear as indicated by a battery vent pressure of zero.
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Number one on the list of things is that the Flight Plan shows CDR should hit the sack. Number two, kind of a summary of your burn. All your SPS and systems look Go. The trajectory shows that you have a CPA with a mode of 69.67 [nautical] miles and the time of pericynthion is 69 plus 10. You do have a capture on a good free return. It's a little bit early to completely evaluate the trajectory for corridor control.
Thank you very much. That was a very fine resume you just sent in. We're right now in the process of trying to dump out the water and the UCTAs and so on and so we'll get with you on the High Gain as soon as we can.
Okay. Good burn.
Houston, what do you want to dump the waste tank down to? [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, I'd like for you to dump the waste tank to 25 percent.
Okay.
And we're dumping now, Houston.
Okay. Thank you.
We finally got some stars to see.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Rog. Do you folks have your water quantity switch in the potable or the waste water tank position now?
We're in the waste tank position now, and we're dumping UTCAs [means UCTAs] first, Houston.
Okay. We weren't watching any waste quantity decrease, and it looked like the nozzle temps indicated that something was going on, and we were trying to dope out what was going on.
Well, there's a lot of stuff going out I'll tell you. How do nozzle temps look?
Oh, about 81 [degrees Fahrenheit, 27 Celsius].
Okay. We'll keep on going then.
Okay, Houston. We're going to dump the waste tank on down to about 25 percent.
Okay. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. Do you copy?
Affirmative, Apollo 8.
Okay. Tell EECOM to wake up and keep an eye on the waste tank servicing. [Pause.]
It'll take a minute to think of something appropriate. [Pause.]
You're slowing down.
So are you guys.
How're the nozzle temperatures looking, Houston?
Stand by.
Man, you're looking pretty small down there now, Houston. [Pause.]
We're carrying a big stick, though.
Just barely make out Clear Lake. [Pause.]
And your nozzle temperatures, Bill, have dropped from about 94 to around 66.
Okay. I'm showing just a little bit above 50 percent here, and we'll keep on going, and if it looks too cold, give us a call.
Okay. We'll do that. [Long pause.]
Houston, we had a momentary O2 high flow, but we think it's due to all the purging of the water lines we're doing here in the cabin.
Roger. We concur.
Apollo 8, Houston. We show you down to 25 percent of your waste water.
Okay, I'm about 28, Houston. Stand by just a bit. [Long pause.]
Okay. Waste dump stopped and then purge again.
Understand. Roger. Waste dump stopped.
Rog.
Houston, we're on a High Gain, and it might be a good time to try your comm check. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, we're going to go ahead and crank up for a comm test now, and we will be a little bit late on your update for 12 hours.
Okay.
Do you still want our - have us command as much as we can on the ground, or would you like to move the switches yourself?
Oh, you can have the fun of doing it.
Sounds like you're dragging there.
[Garble] you suggest a [garble] We're using 1/250 on at f:11 on CEX and C mags for Earth shots. Do you verify? Over.
Okay. You got going before I got my pencil up. How about saying it again?
f:11 - f:11 and 1/250 for CEX 16-mm and C 70-mm.
Okay. Thank you.
How about running it by the back room boys. My light meter doesn't seem to be helping out too much.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8. We're starting in - setting up for our first comm test. This is going to be an uplink voice, ranging, and full downlink, which is not anything really different than what you have on board. I'd like for you to verify that the S-band Normal Mode Voice switch is in Voice.
Roger. Voice.
Okay. And the Uptelemetry Data to Data.
Roger. Data.
Uptelemetry Command in Normal.
Roger. Normal.
High Gain Antenna to Auto Track.
Correction. That's...
Auto.
We're in Auto, Wide Beam, and you can go ahead and dump the tape.
Okay. I'd like for you to go to Narrow Beam.
Okay. Going to Narrow Beam now.
Rog. [Pause.]
And I'll give you a call when we get ready to work on the tape.
Okay. We're still in PTC, so you're only going to have it for about 10 or 15 minutes.
Okay. We've had some problems with our displays, and I think they're straightened out now, but you may have to keep us advised if we run out of limits in case we lose our display again.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Say, while we're standing by here, Apollo 8, the Service Module quantities that we had listed - we're going to try to update them, if you want to call out your quantities. Have you checked them with your charts?
Negative. I haven't gotten around to that. Stand by.
Okay. There's no hurry on that. Just wondered if you had done it; we'll check it against what we've got on our nomogram. [Long pause.]
I'm showing a SPS helium pressure, about 3,570, indicated on board.
Rog.
And fuel/ox[idizer] tank pressures are 177 and 176, respectively.
Okay.
N2: A is 2,400, B 2,500.
Okay. [Long pause.]
And our back room tells you that you've got the right f-stop.
Okay. I will keep using it.
This PTC attitude really isn't the greatest for taking pictures of the Earth.
Rog.
Or of the Moon. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, kinda stand by for a burst of noise, as we change configurations on the ground. We're going into test 1; You'll still have up and downlink, and we'll be in this mode for 2 minutes, but you may hear some burst of noise as we change.
Roger.
Okay, Apollo 8. We're in the middle of our first test, and how about giving me a voice check.
Roger, Houston. This is Apollo 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Apollo 8, out.
Rog. And read you loud and clear. This comm is unbelievably good.
Good.
Okay, Apollo 8. We've finished the first test, and we're now going to change the uplink mode to Uplink Command and Ranging, and we'll be going without upvoice. We'll be in this mode for 2½ minutes and will be sending a test message. It'll have no effect on either your computer or your panel switch configuration. What you might see will be the S-band noise that's associated with the break lock. However, you should still have a good signal on your power meter. This is not a loss of signal, but rather just a loss of the voice modulation, and I'll do you a mark just before we do that so that you can turn your S-band volume down if you so desire, and we'll be back up in this mode that we're in now in two and one half minutes.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We're about to disable the voice modulation on uplink, and we'll be back up no later than 12:13.
Apollo 8, Houston. Voice check.
Read you five-by, Houston. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear. How me?
Okay, loud and clear. We're back up with you. Completed our second test.
Okay. [Pause.]
Okay. Our next test will be a test of the uplink voice and ranging with downlink voice, ranging and low bit rate, so we'll be changing bit rate on you, and we'll be making a voice check in the middle.
Okay. You've about had it on the High Gain. You might try to get it in, but it's going to hit the scan limit at any second. [Long pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8. Looks like we'll get our information before we lose the High Gain.
Okay. We'll just leave it go.
Roger. [Long pause.]
They got the scan limit. We'll let it go, Houston, until it breaks lock. [Pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8. Go ahead and switch to the Omni.
How're you doing with your test?
Okay. We've got three-fifths of the test. We'll have to pick up the rest next time we get a look at the High Gain.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. Running out P21 at - to 69:10 indicates a parallel of about 67.4 [nautical] miles [124.8 km]. I guess we concur here.
You guys are getting pretty good.
That's a lot better than our first answer.
We don't care if we're right, just so MPAD is right.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. I'd like to ask a question about this TLI plus 11 maneuver that we copied. In the remarks, you have P37, Delta-V 790.0. Is this the Delta-V that we would use with P37?
Okay. That's the option that you use with minimum time.
Roger. What I'd like to do is check on our P37 with your TLI maneuver update.
Okay, Apollo 8. We'd like to make sure that we don't have a misunderstanding that this 790.0 feet per second is the Delta-V. It's not associated with the high speed proced - workaround procedure. This is just a standard P37 Delta-V.
Roger. But was that the Delta-V that you used to give us the TLI plus 11 PAD? Okay, I see. Never mind.
Okay. That's not the one that the maneuver PAD was based on. That's the number you put in for the minimum time.
Roger. Understand.
Okay. Sounds like a good idea if you want to go ahead and check out the 37. And we're standing by to work on comm as soon as that High Gain's available.
Roger.
Okay. Houston, you got the High Gain.
Houston, do you read? Apollo 8. Over. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger. The High Gain is yours.
Okay. And if you're ready, why, we'll go ahead with our comm checks.
Go ahead. [Pause.]
We're starting in now on our fourth test. [Pause.] Like for you to put your Telemetry Input switch to PCM High.
It's in High.
Okay. And now we're going to switch uplink to the upvoice backup for about 2 minutes, and it may take a couple of seconds when you hear the upvoice lost. So you can place your Uptelemetry Data switch to Upvoice Backup, and in the event that all of this doesn't work out too well, I'm reading 12:47 on my clock now, and let's meet back in our present configuration no later than 12:50.
Roger. On Upvoice Backup.
Okay. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear.
Okay. That's pretty good. That's Upvoice Backup, and would you confirm that you're in Narrow Beam on High Gain?
Roger. Narrow Beam.
Okay. Thank you. We're going to continue tracking and watching High Gain Antenna here for a couple of minutes, and I'll give you a call when we're ready to go back.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We have completed this test. We'll be switching back to the full uplink. When you hear the noise associated with the loss of modulation, you can go back Uptelemetry Data switch to Data.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8.
Okay. Loud and clear. [Pause.]
How's everything looking down there?
Real fine. We've just got one to go here if you'll put your Telemetry Input PCM switch to Low.
Roger. Going to Low.
Okay. We'll be in that configuration for about 2 minutes, and then we'll be completed with the comm test.
Roger.
I have some Service Module RCS quantities if you would like to take them sometime and check them against your onboard calculations.
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Rog. Ready to copy. Could you give quad A, B, C, and D in that order?
Okay. Will do. And I'll give you weights in pounds and the percentages. Quad A, 231, for 76 percent.
Roger. Stand by. What time is that for?
Oh, 12 plus 15. [Long pause.]
Okay. Got it.
Okay. Quad Bravo, 251, 82 percent. Quad Charlie, 240, 79 percent.
Slow down. [Pause.]
Quad Delta, 245 [115 kg], 81 percent. GNC advises that these numbers are still good even though it is a 12:15 time. And we are completed with a comm test. You can take your High Gain Antenna and go back to Medium. [Pause.]
Roger. Medium. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, we'd like to dump your tape again, if you are not using it. And the reason we want to do this is we have some that we didn't completely get dumped before the burn. We would like to get that and get the rest of the burn data. There's no hurry on it. We can do it whenever it is convenient for you.
You got it.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Do you call?
Negative, negative. Negative, Houston.
Okay. Thank you. Say, we're curious what you did about your Mae West? [Long pause.]
We thought we might bleed the CO2 out into the vacuum connector here in our next water dump. We forgot it the last time. [Pause.] Did you copy?
Rog. Doesn't seem like there is any problem with going ahead and dumping it in the cockpit if you like. [Long pause.]
It is CO2, isn't it?
That's affirm. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We asked it again, and it looks like no problems at all with going ahead and bleeding it down in the cockpit. And then if you need it again on entry or after entry, why, we can blow it up with oral tube.
Rog. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 8. Read you loud and clear. How us?
Okay. Loud and clear now. Didn't get you there for a while.
We were reading you all along, Houston.
Rog. Did you attempt to transmit, or were you just not getting through?
Roger. We attempted to transmit, and it sounded like you had a stuck mike there for a little while.
Okay. That shouldn't make any difference to us on this duplex mode. [Pause.] Okay. What I was calling for, Apollo 8 - we've got a maneuver PAD that is TLI plus 25. I would like to read up to you when you're ready for it. [Long pause.]
Go ahead, Houston. TLI plus 25.
Okay. TLI plus 25, and this will be an SPS/G&N. 63087; minus 1.62, plus 1.29; 027:56:29.64; minus 0016.3, plus 0000.1, plus 5275.9; 177, 137, 001; November Alpha, plus 0020.1; 5275.9, 6:23, 5254.3; 14, 234.7, 33.7; 023, up 19.5, left 1.7; plus 11.45, minus 165.00; 1278.0, 35890, 074:38:16; north stars: 068, 097, 356; no ullage. For the fast return P37 Delta-V, 7900 to the Indian Ocean. High-speed procedures are not required. Over. [Pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. Maneuver PAD as follows. How do you read? Over.
Loud and clear.
Roger. TLI plus 25; SPS/G&N; 63087; minus 1.62, plus 1.29; 027:56:29.64; minus 0016.3, plus 0000.1, plus 5275.9; 177, 137, 001; not applicable, plus 0020.1; 5275.9, 6:23, 5254.3; 14, 234.7, 33.7; 023, up 19.5, left 1.7; plus 11.45, minus 165.00; 1278.0, 35890, 074:38:16; north set; 068, 097, 356; no ullage, P37 fast return of 7 - 700 and 7900 Delta-V, Indian Ocean. High speed not required.
That's correct, Apollo 8. And we'll have a couple of more things for you before too long. We're working an a flyby PAD at this time. And we're going to be talking some more to you about the problems of looking at stars in the sextant and the telescope. And what we'd like to do as soon as the Black Team comes on the MOCR, while we have two teams here, we'd like to get a rehash from you on exactly what you see and what you don't see under what conditions, and see if we can define it so that everyone here understands what you've been telling us. And if you have any comments concerning the timeline - knowing that we got off our timeline before the burn - if you have any comments about that method of getting back on schedule, why, we'd like to hear those, too.
Roger. We have one request. CDR would like to get clearance to take a Seconal. [Pause.]
Okay, Apollo. That's a Go. [Pause.]
Roger.
And, Houston, this is 8. We might go over our future Nav sighting schedule if it's going to be revised at all. [Pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8. There are no planned revisions.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. [I] have your flyby PAD now so I can give that to you whenever you're ready for it. [Pause.]
Standby. [Long pause.] Ready to copy.
Okay, Apollo 8. Here we go on a flyby maneuver PAD. This will be an SPS/G&N; 63087; minus 1.62, plus 1.29; 060:59:48.04; plus 0096.2, plus 0056.8, minus 0207.7; 000, 000, 000; November Alpha, plus 0020.2; 0235.9, 0:22, 0228.2; 03, 039.9, 31.4; 013, up 04.8, right 3.7; plus 14.18, minus 165.00; 1290.4, 36160, 146:29:11; north stars; 323, 090, 056; no ullage. Remarks: number one, this requires realignment to preferred REFSMMAT. Two, this will raise the perilune to 550 nautical miles. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. Read back.
Go ahead.
Flyby; SPS/G&N; 63087; minus 1.62, plus 1.29; 060:59:48.04; plus 0096.2, plus 0056.8, minus 0207.7; 000, 000, 000; N/A. Are you with me so far?
Keep going.
Plus 0020.2; 0235.9, 0:22, 0228.2; 03, 039.9, 31.4; 013, up 04.8, right 3.7; plus 14.18, minus 165.00; 1290.4, 36160, 146:29:11; north; 323, 090, 056; no ullage. Realign for preferred REFSMMAT, and perigee is 50.
That's a perilune to 550.
Understand. 550.
That's affirm, and that's perilune.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We've completed the dump and the tape recorder is yours, and we listened to the call data voice playback, and you've been given a Go for your first test in creative writing.
Roger. Are we in low bit rate now?
That's negative. You're in high bit, and you understand that it's your tape recorder?
Rog. Are you going to stay in high bit [rate] all along, or are you going to be back to low [bit rate] here soon, [pause.] not that it matters much to us, really.
Okay. We plan to stay in high bit rate. We're going to ask you if it made any difference, and you read our minds. That's pretty good for 63K [i.e. 63,000 nautical miles].
Rog. That's an altitude record for mind reading.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. Onboard calculations indicate that at 13 hours and 30 minutes GET, we are now 64,200 [nautical] miles above the Earth. [Pause.] That's using Aldrin's slide rule.
We've got 63,855 [118,259 km]. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is Apollo 8. We're going to try to keep the conversation down here for a while so the CDR can go to sleep.
Okay. We would like to get some comments from you before you sign off concerning the telescope and sextant; and a verification that you have done something with the CO2 in your Mae West and comment on the window status.
Roger. Is it a requirement that we do something with the CO2 at this time? Over.
No. That's negative.
Roger. We have maintained the same condition. We have left it as it was, and will take care of it later.
Okay. [Pause.]
Let me at this time go over the comments about the navigation as I see it so far.
Go.
In the beginning, the operation with the S-IVB precluded immediate starting up of our sightings as we had scheduled since we had another evasive maneuver. The dumping of [propellant from] the S-IVB caused a tremendous amount of - of pseudo-stars in the area which made an optics calibration practically impossible. The method which we had worked out did not seem to work too well. The method which I finally used was to go into P23, go to Sirius, which was our brightest star, get the shaft and trunnion, and then fly the spacecraft up to Sirius to use that for the optics cal, which we did at a later time. With regards to light scatter, it appears that at almost any attitude during our Passive Thermal Control, we are receiving light scattering in the scanning telescope. It takes the form mostly of a wide band of light right across the center of the scope about 10 degrees either direction of zero. It's very difficult to see stars in this area. The realignments have been good. I have been able to pick up the star in the sextant to do the alignment, but I was not able to identify the star which we used in such cases as Regor or Menkent in the scanning telescope. The first star sightings which I took of the Earth showed a very indistinct horizon. But there did appear to be a very - or somewhat sharp line between what appeared to be the Earth's horizon and the atmosphere. The landmark line-of-sight filter appeared to help out this horizon definition. There is a very hazy and indistinct horizon through - between the space and the top of the atmosphere itself, and this is a very difficult one to use. [Pause.] As I said before, at times, looking at the Moon with the star - with the Sun in the near vicinity, the area around the Moon, the space around the Moon is not dark, but is a light - appears as a light blue. And this is also the same case as looking into the sextant during alignments with the star - with the Sun in somewhat the vicinity of the optics. However, I have no difficulty in finding these stars in the sextant. I also had no difficulty spotting the stars I used, such as Sirius, Procyon, or Canopus against the Earth during our star-horizon measurements. I can see all three of those stars against the Earth background. I believe it would be very difficult to do a backup GDC alignment using the north set stars, since Navi is not too bright of a star. I was able to spot star constellations in the scanning telescope if they were very bright and well known, such as Cetus and Orion; stars of this nature. I was not able to perceive other constellations. That's about the only comments I have at this time. Over.
Okay. Fine; thank you very much.
We are going to do - Houston - future maneuvers for P23 in a lower - in a slower mode of auto maneuver. Essentially, we're going to load the DAP with 11101 to save fuel.
Roger. That will be a 11101 DAP load.
Rog. We are going to try to save fuel that way.
Good show. [Pause.]
With respect to the windows, Houston, the windows 1 and 5 have moderate haze on them. Satisfactory for visual observation, but possibly not for photography. Windows 2 and 4 are clear. Window 3 is almost opaque. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
And how's battery B looking to you? [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. It looks like it may take another 6 hours on this battery B charge. It turns out that the charge rate is less than what we're getting on the ground curves, but it is still above the Apollo 7 curves, and it looks like it is going along now in good shape. And I would like to have verification that the timeline leading up to the midcourse correction was satisfactory from your point of view.
Roger. Seemed quite satisfactory.
Okay. Thank you. And we'll stay off the loop until you give us a call.
Roger. You don't bother us, but our replies make a lot of noise.
Okay.
Houston. Apollo 8. How do you read? [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. You're very weak. You got the proper Omni? [Long pause.]
Houston. Apollo. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Bill. Go ahead.
Okay. I'm just wondering how your tracking's doing. [Pause.]
Okay. We're still tracking you. We don't have any firm solutions, yet.
Okay. Things [are] looking nominal up here. How about down there?
Okay. The systems basically look good, Bill. We're going to be coming up on a cryo fan cycle period in another few minutes, and you can go ahead and do that when you get ready.
Okay.
And I guess we picked up some suspicions about the fuel cell 2 radiator out tab. How does that compare on board?
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, you called?
Roger. We're showing Rad[iator] Out Temp on fuel cell 2 to be about 90 degrees, and on 1 and 3 to be slightly lower - maybe 75, 80 degrees. About an hour ago, plotted out fuel cells performance; it looks like 1 and 2 are lower performance than 3. Over.
Rog. We're showing the same numbers on your outlet temperatures and it appears to us that that's a sensor failure. We've been watching the thing and we'll keep you advised of anything we see.
Okay. [Pause.]
And on the performance, you're right - they are not quite the same, 1 and 2 are a little bit lower but all these are sitting within the ballpark.
Roger. Fuel cell 1 has shown slightly a proportionately higher H2 flow than O2 flow all day long.
Okay. [Pause.]
I'm showing 0.062 H2 and 0.48 O2.
Rog. We'll take some cal[ibration] curves on those. [Long pause.]
Okay. These things look reasonable to us and we'll keep looking at them. Our readout shows about 0.43 as opposed to your 0.48 on the oxygen, and we'll keep an eye on the cal curves and just sort of watch it for you.
Okay. Thank you. [Pause.]
If you'd like to set up some kind of a comm check or specified time like every 30 minutes or so on these quiet periods, that would be okay with us. Might help to let us know that we're still in business.
Alright. Just give me a call every now and then.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Sometime when it's convenient, get your biomed switch over to the right, and you don't need to answer; just pass it up to you.
Apollo 8, Houston. How about a comm check, and did you get that fuel cell purge - correction, the cryo fans, On?
Roger. We had the cryo fans, On, each for about 3 or 4 minutes.
Okay. Real good. We weren't real sure that's what we were watching, and you're coming through loud and clear.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.
Okay, Jim. Got an update here to the Flight Plan. You've got the 16:55 star visibility check, and what we've got on that, [it] looks like Navi is still our star, and the numbers associated with that are roll, 102.6; pitch, 328.9; yaw, 346.3. That gives you a shaft and trunnion of zero. And if you think you can - if you think you can do something with this, why, we'd like to go ahead and give it a try and see if we can either verify it or maybe we'll both learn something if we verify it if you can't do it with Navi.
Roger. Stand by one.
Sure thing.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We'll maneuver at this present time and try to pick up that attitude and get Navi, although I think it's a waste of time, but we will give it a try.
Roger. Standing by for results.
