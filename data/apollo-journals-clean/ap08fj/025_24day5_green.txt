Houston. How do you read Apollo 8?
Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
Hello Michael, we lost lock and Bill hit Command Reset to get the lock back on again, but you're welcome to the antenna.
Okay, Frank. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Good morning, Michael.
Good morning.
Or is it afternoon? Or is it afternoon?
Apollo 8, Houston. You've got a lot of background noise and about unreadable. [Pause.] We're trying to get a better Omni. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read? Over.
Loud and clear.
Okay. You're loud and clear. This Bill?
None other.
I got a message for you while you were asleep. Valerie said to tell you that she and the kids are leaving for church about 11:30 and eagerly awaiting your return. She said presents are magically starting to appear under the Christmas tree again so it looks like a double barrel Christmas. Over.
You can't beat a deal like that. [Pause.] How was Christmas at your house today?
Early and busy as usual. I told Michael you guys are up there, and he said who's driving?
That's a good question. [Pause.] I think Isaac Newton is doing most of the driving right now.
Say again.
I think Isaac Newton is doing most of the driving right now.
Rog. We copy. [Long pause.]
Well, give Valerie and the kids a Merry Christmas for me, Mike, and tell them I'll see them there in a while.
I sure will, and you might tell Frank if he's got any messages his people are about 10 feet away.
He said "bah humbug."
Howdy, how're you all?
You've got a whole row of smiling faces in the back room, Frank.
Very good. Well, they'd be proud of me: I'm using the Exer-Genie right now.
Don't overdo it.
I won't.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Quad Able helium tank temperature has dropped very slightly and is looking pretty good to us now.
Thank you, Michael.
Righto, and I've got a procedure for Jim which I'd like to read up. It involves bringing the LM and CSM state vectors to the Earth sphere of influence. Over.
All right. Stand by.
Okay. [Pause.]
He's getting his hat on now. Whose procedure is this, Michael?
Oh, it's the summation of the opinions of all our experts down here. I got it from Mr. Colossus, Gunther Sabionski.
Very good. I want to make sure it wasn't another Aldrin special.
I'm sorry you're broken up. Don't say again. [Laughter.] [Pause.]
Merry Christmas, Buzze. [Pause.]
Yeah, Merry Christmas up there, Jim. I've got a procedure when you are ready to copy.
Okay. I just got on the headset; just let me get a pencil and paper here, and I'll copy it.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, Mike.
Okay. The purpose is to bring the LM and the CSM state vectors to the Earth's sphere of influence. Step 1: Verb 37 Enter, 23 Enter. Step 2: At Noun 70, at Noun 70, load in register 1, 2, and 3 the following numbers. Register 1, 00002; register 2, five balls; register 3, 00210. Step 3: proceed on Noun 70, Noun 70. Step 4: proceed on Noun 25, 25. Step 5: do not proceed on Noun 18. Wait for 30 seconds; then do Verb 37 Enter, 00 Enter. End of procedure. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. As I understand it, the reason for this procedure is to bring the LM and CSM state vectors back into the Earth's sphere of influence; is that correct?
That's correct.
Okay. To do it, we go Verb 37 Enter, 23 Enter; and at the Noun 70, we'll load in register 1, four balls 2; register 2, all balls; and register 3, two balls 210. We'll proceed on Noun 70, we'll proceed on Noun 25. We will not proceed on 18. We'll wait 30 seconds, and we'll do a Verb 37 Enter, 00 Enter.
That's affirmative. Apollo 8. [Pause.]
I'm just kinda curious, Mike; I thought this was done for us. I thought the computer took care of this little problem. [Pause.]
Roger. Normally, it is done automatically, Jim; and had you done the P23s exactly as scheduled, it would have been, but there was some doubt P23 was stopped about 7 minutes prior to the transition point and just to be absolutely sure, we included this procedure. Over.
Okay. [Long pause.] Tell Buzz I could sure use his eye-patch.
Roger. Understand. I had one on Gemini X. Worked real well.
Mike, you want me to do this procedure now?
That's affirmative, Jim. Now at your convenience.
Did you see guidance? Is the flag set? Reset, that's right.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger Jim. We copied your DSKY work there, and it's looking just fine to us now.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
You know, one thing you can pass on to the program office - something you might try working on right away is...
Can you stand by, Apollo 8?
Apollo 8, can you stand by? We'll try to get you a better antenna; you're just about unreadable.
All right. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We are right in between antennas and if you can wait about 5 minutes with your message, we should have better comm then.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. You're Loud and clear now, Frank. Go ahead with what you were saying about the program office.
They ought to get some moving out on some way to fix these windows. The three windows, the hatch window and the two side windows, really it's a shame, the fact that they're almost - excuse me - almost totally unusable, because they got so gummed up.
Roger, I sure agree. We - we copy so far on the windows that 2 and 4 are still in excellent shape and 1 and 5 are sort of mediocre and 3 is just about totally unusable.
Three is totally unusable and 1 and 5 are unusable for any kind of photography.
Roger.
And, Mike, that sure puts the CMP in a bad light, you know, when you can't see where you're going.
Yeah, when you're sitting between two guys that won't tell you, too. [Laughter.]
That's right. You think they'd share a window? No soap. You might also note the optics are very good visibility so far. No coating at all.
Glad to hear that, Jim.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We copy Jim doing a P52, and I'm standing by with a maneuver PAD for midcourse 5, anytime at your convenience. [Long pause.]
Okay. Ready to copy, Mike.
Roger, Jim. This is midcourse maneuver number 5, and it's a RCS/G&N: and it's 31700; not applicable, not applicable. Are you with me?
With you.
Good. 103:59:52.86; minus 0005.0, plus all zeros, plus 0000.1; 000, 334, 001; five zeros - 00000, plus 0019.0; 0005.0, 0:14, 0005.0. Are you still with me? Over.
Still with you.
Good. 41, 302.0, 18.3: Shaula, down 06.4, left 0.6; plus 07.47, minus 164.10; 1298.8, 36301, 146:46:40; north set of stars, Sirius and Rigel; roll, 308; pitch, 209; yaw, 357; remarks: use high-speed procedure with minus MA. Over. [Pause.]
Roger, Houston. MCC-5; RCS/G&N. Are you with me?
I'm with you, Jim.
31700; N/A, N/A, 103:59:52.86: minus 0005.0, plus all zeros, plus 0000.1: 000, 334, 001; all zeros, plus 0019.0; 0005.0, 0:14, 0005.0; 41, 302.0, 18.3; Shaula, down 06.4, left 0.6; plus 07.47, minus 164.10; 1298.8, 36301, 146:46:40; Sirius, Rigel, 308, 209, 357; use high-speed procedure with minus MA.
Roger. And could you go to Accept, please, and we're going to send you a P27 load consisting of a LM state vector and a target load for MCC-5.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. We'd like to dump your waste water tank down to 25 percent; we'd like to do it before the midcourse, for tracking reasons. So if it is convenient with you, if you start right now, we'll dump on down to 25.
Roger. We'll get right with it.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We got those loads in and verified; you can go back Block at your computer. And George Low says he's working on that window problem at 6, or spacecraft 104. You just happen to have the wrong spacecraft.
That's the wrong statement; we've got the right spacecraft. I'll clue you, if it keeps going this way for 2 more days, we've got not only the right spacecraft, we've got the best spacecraft.
It'll keep going.
Apollo 8. We're starting the dump now, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Okay. We're starting the waste water dump now.
Okay, Bill [means Frank]. Thank you. [Long pause.]
That's a blizzard.
Rog. Understand. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. I need a Pop Romeo Dog on all three and a status report on the LMP.
Roger. The LMP's PRD hasn't moved an inch since we took off. And that's the one the CMP used to have, still 0.64. And I just had about 5½ hours sleep, and I'm in the process of scarfing up a meal; and I've been drinking lots of water, feeling good, and that's about it.
Okay. And you got a PRD on the other two.
Yes. The CMP's PRD is reading point - The CMP's is reading 0.12 rem.
And the CDR: I got stuck with somebody else's, but mine reads now - my new one reads 2.02 rem. I don't know if there is a message there or not.
He's starting to glow in the dark. [Pause.]
Yeah. You should have - you should have hung on to the one you had. It sounded a little bit better. I copy left to right 2.02, 0.12, and 0.64. Over.
Roger.
Thank you, sir.
What have they measured in our [pause] What have they measured on that, I guess you would call it the VABABR, or VABD?
We're sending a boy to the back room to find out.
Find out what it is, or what it's reading?
First one and then the other.
We'll need both answers up here, too.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Bill's VABR reading that he requested is 0.13. Over.
Roger. Looks like you've got a little discrepancy here.
Yeah, I agree. [Long pause.]
You ought to give those guys a chance to go back to sleep and calibrate those things. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We just passed 25 percent, and you can terminate your waste water dump, please.
Okay. Will do. [Pause.]
Believe it or not, our gauge is 5 percent behind yours.
Yeah, John Aaron says he's been noticing it.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Yeah. We're going to switch antennas from Madrid to Goldstone in about 3 minutes. You should hear the glitch.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Rog. Just for information, would the perigee reading and Noun 42 be such a big minus number for such a small burn? We are reading minus 03137 now.
Rog. Understand; Noun 42 perigee reads minus 03137. Over.
Roger. We're going through Program 30 after you give us the target load, and I didn't think there would be that much of a change for such a small burn.
Roger. Stand by. We'll check into it, Jim.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. We don't think there's any problem or any funnies in this perigee prediction of minus 03137. It's a Keplerian prediction, and it's not very accurate. Now we've taken your vector from the downlink and run it through a make-believe external Delta-V maneuver down here, and we get precisely the correct answer. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. Understand that you figure just because of the conics solution that it comes up.
That's affirmative. The Kepler solution is just pretty gross.
Okay. I was just kind of curious. I could see differences when we were talking about LOI burns, but this being such a short one, I thought it wouldn't be that much difference. I understand.
Mike, this is Frank.
Go ahead.
Y'all are monitoring our - and seeing if we get any inadvertent engine firing all the time, aren't you?
Well, we - we can't tell when you're in low bit rate. When in high bit rate, yes, we are.
Okay. If we crank up high bit rate and just have you take a checkout look at them?
Okay. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Since you're on Omni D, Dog, at this time, we're sort of 180 out of phase for the High Gain. As soon as we can get High Gain lock, then we'll, with our high bit rate, be looking at those - be looking for any thruster firings, but we can't do it until then. Over.
Okay. We'll take the antennas and get on the High Gain as soon as we can.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. We've done some more checking, and we confirm that that is the correct Keplerian prediction on Noun 42, minus 03137, just like you said.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We are going to be doing a ranging sequence; if we could eliminate voice for a couple of minutes, we'd appreciate it.
Roger. We will.
For a change.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Our ranging's complete, and we've been monitoring your thruster firings, and they show what appears to be very normal damp activity. Over.
Thank you.
Okay.
I guess it was associated with the water vent.
Roger. Understand, Frank.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Frank, we've got about 2½ minutes to ignition, and we're still showing some of your SCS switches not set up as per checklist; specifically, rate Low, deadband Minimum, and your BMAG modes at attitude one, rate two.
Okay. Thank you.
And your manual attitude switch is in Rate Command.
Right.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Mark.
One minute to ignition. Over.
Roger. We concur. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Mark.
Twenty seconds to ignition.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Jim.
Rog. We burned on time, 14 seconds, attitude nominal. Our residuals were plus 2 in VGX, minus 1 in VGY nothing in VGZ. Our EMS stopped about 6.2 and was counting up - up to - continued counting after the burn.
Rog. Understand 14 seconds, burn on time, nominal attitude, two-tenths X, one-tenth Y, and nothing minus one-tenth Y, and nothing Z; and you put 6.2 on the EMS, and it continued to count after the burn. Is that affirmative?
No. We put the burn - we put the burn Delta-V in the EMS, and after the burn, it was still counting.
Rog. Understand.
It was counting up.
Understand. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. We transferred the state vector to the LM slot.
Roger, Jim. Thank you, and I still don't understand you on this EMS. Counted down from 5 to zero normally and then continued through zero in a negative way, and now it's reading minus 6.2? Is that affirmative?
Rog. That's right. It was counting up when we shut it off. Last time I saw it, it was 6.9. Now Frank just put it on to Auto again with the Delta-V function switch in Delta-V, and it jumped six-tenths. Then he tried the second time, and it stayed at zero so we really don't know what the story is.
Rog. Understand you.
Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Frank.
I guess you want us to resume PTC, right? [Pause.]
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
We'd like you to resume the PTC attitude; pitch, 010; yaw, 045; and then come out of it again for your P23 that you're scheduled for about another hour and 10 minutes, in another hour and 10 minutes.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Mike, this is Frank. Is this TV still scheduled for 104:50?
That's affirmative, Frank, if you can manage it.
Okay. [Pause.]
How's it going with the TV, Frank? Are we - can the networks count on having it on schedule? Over.
Yeah, we can have it on schedule. We don't have much to do, but we'll perform for you.
Okay. We got a bunch of filter experts standing by if you need any advice.
Well, we're just going to have to just do it inside today because there's no good shots of the Moon and the Earth; the Sun's too darn bright.
I think it's raining out there.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. On this EMS, when I put it in Delta-V, it's reading zero; then I switched to Auto. Sometimes it'll count to 19 or 20 feet per second. I guess that's what happened.
Rog. Understand when you put it to Auto, it maybe will keep counting up to as much as 19, 20 feet per second.
Just when you put it to Auto; it'll start counting on some occasions, by itself.
Understand.
Mike, we're ready when you are.
We're ready. [Pause.]
Say again.
Yeah, we're ready, Frank. We're all squared away and eagerly standing by.
Oh boy. [Long pause.]
You got your make-up on?
Yeah. Have we got a picture?
Negative, Frank. [Long pause.]
How about now, Houston?.
Negative, Frank. [Long pause.]
We don't seem to have much luck today, but don't call for a repairman yet. It may be our camera here. [Long pause.]
Any results yet, Mike?
Negative, Frank. It may be that it hasn't warmed up properly.
Okay. We've had it on for a while. Are you getting our FM okay?
Okay, Frank. There - we got it. It's coming in loud and clear. We look like we're looking at your hat and now the MDC. [Pause.]
Okay. Well, good afternoon. This is the Apollo 8 crew. And how's it focusing now, Houston?
It's looking good. If you can hold the thing still, there's sort of a time delay. Any motion at all ruins our picture.
Tell me if there's any difference in it now.
It's looking good now.
Okay, fine.
It looks like you're okay, but somebody else is upside down.
Okay. That's right. That's Jim Lovell. What we thought we'd do today was just show you a little bit about life inside Apollo 8. We've shown you the scenes of the Moon, the scenes of the Earth, and we thought we'd invite you into our home. It's been our home at least for four days as you can see on the instrument panel. We - we mark off each day on the - on the instrument panel. We're four down, and we're working on the fifth day. Of course, we're all looking forward to the landing on Friday. Down here in the part of the spacecraft that we call the Lower Equipment Bay, we have the President's adviser on physical fitness, Captain Jim Lovell, about to undergo an exercise program that we do every day. You notice that he floats around very freely. He just bumped his head on the optics, used for our navigating. [Pause.] He's working with an exercise device that's designed to keep the muscles in shape. [Pause.] Now another very important function of our spacecraft is the computer, and I thought you might be interested in seeing what we have here, the displays that give us all the information about our burns, about navigating, and about the velocities that we use during entry and retro-fire on Earth-orbital missions. You can see it's controlled by a DSKY, or similar to a typewriter keyboard, and the things that go in and out of that are absolutely miraculous. It's done a fantastic job for us, and Jim Lovell's done an excellent job operating it. Now another very important thing, whether you're in space or the ground, is eating, and I've asked Bill Anders to show you how we eat up here in the flight. Pardon the picture while we move around here and change cameras. [Pause.] The food that we use is all dehydrated; it comes prepackaged in vacuum-sealed bags. You notice that all Bill has to do to keep it in one place is let go of it. Except for the air currents in the spacecraft, it would stay perfectly still. He gets out his handy, dandy scissors and cuts the bag. [Long pause.] The food is varied, generally pretty good. If that doesn't sound like a rousing endorsement, it isn't, but nevertheless, it's pretty good food. [Pause.] You can see that Bill is very clever. He does things swiftly. Actually, those food bags are stuck together because they've been vacuum packed in plastic.
What do you have today, Bill, for dinner?
Well, here we have some cocoa; should be good. I'll be adding about 5 ounces of hot water to that. [Pause.] These are little sugar cookies, [pause] some orange juice, [long pause] corn chowder, [pause] chicken and gravy, and a little napkin to wipe your hands when you're done. I'll prepare some orange juice here. [Long pause.]
Okay. You can see that he's taking his scissors and cutting the plastic end off the little [pause] - the little nozzle that he's going to insert the water gun into. The water gun dispenses half-ounce bursts of water per click. [Long pause.] Here we go; Bill has it in now, and the water's going in. [Long pause.] I hope that you all had better Christmas dinners today than us, but nevertheless, we thought you might be interested in how we eat.
Rog. I haven't heard any complaints down here, Frank. We'll bring you up to speed on your food when you get back.
Very good.
Looks like a happy home you've got up there.
Ordinarily, we let these drinks - Ordinarily, we let these drinks settle for 5 or 10 minutes, but Bill's going to drink it right now. Then, to get on with the program, he cuts open another flap, and you'll see a little tube comes out...
This is not a commercial. [Long pause.]
...and he drinks his delicious orange drink. Maybe I should say he drinks his orange drink. He's usually not that fast. Bill is really in a hurry today. Well, that's what we eat. Now another very important part of the spacecraft is the navigation station or the optics panel. And we - just a minute; Bill wants to say something.
That's good; but not quite as good as good old California orange juice.
Bill's from Florida.
Okay. Now if you'll let me have the camera, Jim, and I'll show the people where you do most of your work. Okay. Bill (means Jim), can you explain it?
If I can clean up some of Bill's food around here, and have it away. [Long pause.] Down in this area is called the LEB or the Lower Equipment Bay, and we have our optics positioning equipment right here. We do all our navigation down here by sighting on stars and on horizons of either the Moon or the Earth. And this is where we find out exactly where we are in space, what direction, and how fast we are traveling. And our computer, as Frank has mentioned, takes information and tells us how to maneuver to get home safely. I work with the scanning telescope and the sextant, and occasionally, if I get too busy, I just sort of float out of sight and go up into the tunnel which is the tunnel to the hatch of the Lunar Module which we don't have onboard, of course. [Pause.]
Now that's about all we have for today. I - each and every one of us wish each and every one of you a very Merry Christmas. And, we - I guess we'll see you tomorrow, and we'll be landing early Friday morning. Merry Christmas from Apollo 8.
Roger. Merry Christmas from the ground, Apollo 8, and thank you very much for the guided tour. We really enjoyed it.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Mike.
We're suggesting attitude deadband, Max, and rate, High.
You're right, Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Frank.
How soon will they tell us what effect that midcourse had on our trajectory, Mike?
Oh, the longer we track, the smarter we'll get; but stand by one for a pertinent answer. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Tentatively, your midcourse correction at 122 hours is zero; and in about an hour and a half, we'll have some track data to confirm that. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay. [Pause.]
We're going to have something to eat here, Mike; just taking it easy now.
Rog. Understand, Frank. [Long pause.]
Did you get another shotgun for Christmas? [Pause.]
No, I'm missing enough with the one I have.
That's what Edwin told me; I thought maybe you might want to try another one. [Pause.]
What was it, 40 shots at four birds?
Oh, negative, Frank. I'm 100 percent, one bird per box.
Then you and I are in the same fix.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
It appears that we did a grave injustice to the food people. Just after our TV show, Santa Claus brought us some - a TV dinner each, which was delicious. Turkey and gravy, cranberry sauce, grape punch; outstanding.
Roger, Jim. Glad to hear it. [Pause.] Now we're down here eating cold coffee and bologna sandwiches.
Houston, Apollo 8. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. We've got an awful lot of these stars to mark on now, Mike, and we were - they were having some concern about the PTC. Will you let us know if we stay in one position too long, or if we have to knock off and do some PTC?
Will do, Frank.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're monitoring your temperatures. The quads all look good. We'll continue to do so, and we expect no difficulty with them during the P23 work.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Our highest tank temperature now is C.
Understand; C is the hot one.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Bill. We'd like to talk about your High Gain Antenna sometime when you get a minute.
Okay. Just a second, Mike.
About 5 minutes, Mike, we'll be done here.
Hi Houston, Apollo 8. About the High Gain Antenna.
Okay, Bill. We think it'd be an extremely worthwhile thing to find out how it operates in the Auto Reacq mode, and we propose running a test on it in that mode from 109 to 111 hours GET. Over.
Okay. We'll do that.
Okay. I have about a...
We'll try it on the way out. [Pause.]
We have a detailed procedure which we can read up to you anytime you're ready.
Go ahead.
Okay. We suggest the start time, 109 hours GET; stop time, 111 hours; and you'll be in a PTC. We're requesting a left roll rate, which we notice you've been preferring, a left roll rate of 1 revolution per hour, and this is in your present PTC attitude (i.e. pitch, 10 degrees, 010 degrees; and yaw, 45 degrees). Procedure is this: step 1, stop at roll angle 150 degrees; acquire - this is step 2 - acquire in Manual mode; 3, switch to Auto Narrow Beam; 4, make sure tracking in Auto mode then switch to Auto Reacq mode; 5, position the High Gain Antenna...
Wait a minute, Houston.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay. Whoa, whoa. Standing by.
I'm still starting. [Pause.]
Okay. Make sure tracking in Auto and then what?
Make sure tracking in Auto, and then switch to Auto Reacq mode. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. Will do.
Okay. Step 5, position High Gain Antenna pitch and yaw control to predicted Earth rise angles, and those angles are yaw, 50 degrees; pitch, minus 40 degrees. Over. [Pause.]
Okay.
Okay. Two more steps. Step 6, remain on High Gain Antenna in this mode for two revs. Do not switch to Omni anytime during these two revs, and maintain mode configuration of voice and data. We expect the loss of track should be no more than 15 minutes per rev. Over. [Pause.]
Roger.
And the final step, 7, if any problem arises, go back to your initial gimbal angles of 10 degrees pitch, 45 degrees yaw, and 150 degrees roll; reacquire and go to Auto mode. Over.
Yeah, let's - I guess there ought to be a step 4A which says start roll again, right? [Pause.]
That's affirmative. Excuse me there, that's affirmative.
Okay. If - let's see, if we - I don't understand your last comment. If we get into a problem, you want us to go back to 150 degrees roll?
Well, all we want you to do is go ahead and reacquire in the Auto mode, Bill. And it looks like that would be one way of doing it. But all we're saying is, you know, if you want to talk to us about something, or you have any other problems, or you don't like the way it looks, anything at all, just go ahead and reacquire in the Auto mode.
Yeah, why don't we just say if we do have problems, it doesn't pick it up when it's supposed to, give it a good try, and then call you up on the Omnis or position ourselves and we'll talk about it and try for another two revs.
That's just fine, Bill.
Okay. It's worked. We tried it once or twice on the way out, but the one modification is once it did break lock, and go to its manual position, but I switched to the Omnis in between. That sounds fine.
Bill, could you run through that again? We're not reading you too loud, and would you say again what you tried on the way out, please.
On the right way out, they gave us some Reacq angles which we used, and once it broke lock and repositioned itself, why, it went over to the Omnis and waited till we got to near breaking lock again and switched back and snapped right in there [Pause.].
Roger. Thanks. We copy. [Pause.]
We have a few more stars to get, and then we'll give it a try.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Rog, Bill. We got a bunch of tapes of some of your favorite music down here. You be interested in hearing a little background on the S-band?
Go ahead.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. For some reason, we suddenly got a Program 01 and a 'No Attitude' light on our computer.
We confirm that. [Long pause.]
Stand by one, Jim. We're working on a procedure for getting you cranked back up again.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. Jim, while we're working on this procedure, we'd like to know did you select 01, did you get a Verb 37 Enter. 01 Enter? [Pause.]
Let's see, I'm not too sure, Mike. I might have done that, yeah.
Okay.
We have star 01 coming up, now that might have been the reason.
Okay. We understand. Why don't you just hold what you've got on your DSKY, and we'll be with you shortly.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Rog. Could you or Bill give us a better Omni antenna, please?
Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. Frank, our procedure is to select P00, and from P00 go to P51, and get a platform alignment. After you've done that, we will send you up a P27, a REFSMMAT, and then you can do P52 REFSMMAT options, and you'll be back in business. Over.
Okay, Mike. Thank you.
Roger.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. [No answer.]
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Go ahead. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Say again. Over.
Okay. We've completed a P51 now. You want us to try a P52, or do you want us to wait till we can put a REFSMMAT in?
Stand by one, will you, please, Frank?
Roger. [Pause.]
We're putting together a P27 load for you now, Frank; that's the reason for the delay. We just want to make sure we don't overlook anything before we send it up to you.
Okay. We'll just sit tight then. We've got a good P51. We'll just wait till you put in a REFSMMAT, and then, of course, we'll fine align over to that, right?
That's right, that's exactly right. Just stand by. [Long pause.]
Mike, this is Frank again.
Go ahead.
I suggest that we go ahead while you're doing that, do a P52 here, and let it do an automatic and just tweak this up. Jim had to use Rigel and Sirius, and they're pretty close together. And although we got a zero difference for the star angle, that might not be a bad idea just to try a 52 here.
We'd rather not do that, Frank. Stand by one.
All right. We won't do a thing. [Long pause.]
Frank, we - we feel that procedure that you're talking about is - is really not required. It's sort of wasting your time. You'd still have to - upon completion of that, we'd have to send you a new REFSMMAT, and you'd have to go ahead and do a P52 to that REFSMMAT in addition. Over.
We understand that. Go ahead. We'll wait for your REFSMMAT.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. If you'd go P00 and Accept, we have our P27 ready. We'll send you up a REFSMMAT. Over.
Roger. P00 and Accept.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Frank, we'd like to make sure you understand, when you do your P52, you want to select option 1, the preferred option, because those are the registers we're blinking now with this P27.
Roger. Option 1; thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. We got a good load in; it's your computer. Go to Block.
Okay.
Roger. Stand by.
And you can go ahead with your P52 at your convenience.
We're going ahead right now.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. When Jim gets to the end of P52, he's got a flashing Verb 37. We'd like him to not proceed, to hold at that point; we'd like to read some bits and pieces out of the computer at that time. Over.
Roger. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, if Anders has got time to give us a countdown, could we get the Biomed switch from center to left?
Two, one...
Mark.
Did you take that 1.7-second time delay into account?
Sorry about that. [Long pause.]
Okay. Houston, you have it. [Pause.]
Thank you, Jim. And I'll give you an estimate here on how long we want to hold at this point; it won't be too much longer.
Rog.
It was my goof; I must have put in 3701 instead of 3723 and star 01.
Rog.
Apollo 8, Houston. We have got a Flight Plan suggestion for you.
Go ahead.
Go ahead and delete the remainder of these P23s that you're working on now, go back to PTC attitude, and then pick up where it says 108 hours in the Flight Plan to pick up again there with your P23, or if you prefer to slip that time a couple of hours, if you want to get some rest in between.
I think that's a good idea; we'll do that.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Mike, what does this do to our state vector?
Not a thing. We've looked at your state vector, and it's good.
So we didn't lose all the nav that we were just - had accomplished, right?
Stand by one on that, Jim. I don't know; I'm checking.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. I say again, your state vector is just fine; it's still tickety-poo, and the reason we're holding here is that we're checking to see whether if any P23 information was lost. That's reason one, and the second reason is that your W-matrix shares some computer memory cells with P01, and we're getting a clarification on the status of your W-matrix before we proceed. Over.
Roger, Michael. [Long pause.]
We'll go ahead and start heading over to the PTC attitude.
Very good. [Long pause.]
Do you need the High Gain any more, Mike? [Pause.]
Negative. We don't need it any more.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Frank. We're coming up on time for an oxygen purge on all three fuel cells. Might be a good time to do it while we're waiting here.
Fine. [Long pause.]
All right. Mike, we're going to purge the three fuel cells, oxygen only.
That's correct. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. That's enough on fuel cell number 1; if you'd start on 2 please.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're on low bit rate now. Last time we saw you, you were still purging. Over.
Roger. [Garble].
You're unreadable, but request that you end your purge.
Roger. We ended our purge.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Jim. I've got a short procedure I'd like to read up to you on your DSKY, and I'd like to explain what it is. Your W-matrix shared some memory locations with P01; therefore, the W-matrix that you have right now is not a good one, and we would not want you to continue your P23 sightings with that matrix. So this procedure I'm going to give you is going to cause the matrix to reinitialize itself prior to your next P23, when you go into P23. And this will put you back with the value of the W-matrix which you loaded after TEI, you remember, that 3303 thing. And if this has any...
Roger.
...further effects on the Flight Plan, we'll - we're in the process of sorting that out, and if need be, we'll send you up a revised sighting schedule later, both for the comm and loss-of-comm case. Over.
Okay. Stand by, and I'll get something to copy with.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. Insert, without releasing the flashing Verb 37, the following: Verb 25 Noun 07 Enter, 77 Enter, 40 Enter, Enter, Verb 37 Enter, 00 Enter. Over. [Pause.]
Understand. We insert Verb 37 without releasing, is that correct?
Rog. You should have flashing 37 on your DSKY now, and without releasing that flashing 37, go ahead with the Verb 25, et cetera.
Oh, Roger. Okay. I see what you mean. Okay. We'll insert Verb 25, Noun 07 Enter, 77 Enter, 40 Enter, Enter, then reinsert Verb 37 Enter, 00 Enter.
That's all correct. And if you've got any questions about that, we would be happy to answer them.
Roger. Are we cleared to do that now?
That's affirmative, Jim.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Hey, Mike, this is Frank.
Go ahead, Frank.
Is there any danger that this might have screwed up any other part of memory that would be involved with entry or anything like that? [Pause.]
Frank, all indications are that there is absolutely no problem with anything in the computer memory other than the W-matrix. However, we are continuing to look at it, and if there is any doubt in our mind, we will ask you to dump the memory locations for us later. Over.
Okay. Fine.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Jim. We thought you might be interested in knowing, based on 2½ hours worth of track after your last midcourse, and looking ahead, we're predicting that the midcourse correction at 122 hours will be less than 1 foot per second. And keeping on going to Entry Interface minus 2 hours, we're predicting a 2-foot-per-second midcourse at that time. Now those numbers will be refined; we'll get about another 8 hours of track on you before we amend them. Over.
Sounds like we're on a pretty good trajectory.
Can't hardly beat it. [Pause.]
After we do these next P23s, I'll see what our P37 gives us. What's that midcourse, 122 hours, that has practically zero?
Yeah. It's looking to be less than 1 foot per second, about four-tenths of a foot per second right now. And then the one before entry, at 2 hours before Entry Interface, is looking to be about 2 feet per second. [Pause.]
Roger. Okay. Well, I'll - I'll run a P37, and we can just compare the difference.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over. [No answer.]
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger. You got the J.O.D. back on watch again. We want to make sure we don't overdo the star sightings at the expense of thermal control, so you might keep an eye on us and give us a No-Go if we start getting too hot on one side.
Roger. Will do, Bill. Has Jim gone to bed?
No, I'm right here, Mike. We're going to start doing cislunar nav right now, and Bill's up in the left-hand seat.
Rog. Understand you're going to do some P23s now, huh? We thought you were going to take a rest and do them later.
No, Frank's asleep now. We'll get these out of the way. So I'm going over to do a trunnion alignment at this time, and then we'll go into the P23. [Pause.]
Okay, Jim. There's one thing before you get started on the P23. What we told you before, we still think is absolutely correct. The only thing in the computer memory that is changed by that P02 [means P01] is the W-matrix. However, as an additional precaution, we'd like to dump the computer memory and go through it and check it bit by bit and make sure everything is exactly copacetic. Over.
Okay. Do you want to do that now?
Affirmative. We're getting Goldstone configured for it; it'll be just a minute. And while we're doing that, I can read you the procedure if you're ready to copy.
Okay. Stand by one, and I'll be ready to copy pretty soon.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Go ahead.
Okay. We'd like a Verb 01 Noun 01 Enter, 333 Enter, and then we'd like you to read us register 1. Register 1 we expect will be a 10000, 1 0 0 0 0. And if register 1 is equal to that, then what that means is that the computer will dump its erasable memory twice. That's 10,000 numbers, twice number for the erasable memory dump. If it's not reading 10000, then we'll ask you to make it read 10000 by going Verb 21 Noun 01 Enter, 333 Enter, 10000 Enter. And after you've done that, then the dump Verb is Verb 74 Enter, and that will automatically dump the total erasable memory twice, and return you to the proper configuration.
Okay. The procedure will be Verb 01 Noun 01 Enter, 333 Enter, and read out register 1. If it's 10000, the memory - the computer will then dump the memory twice if properly configured. If not, we have to load in 10000, and we do that by going Verb 21 Noun 01 Enter, 333 Enter, 10000 Enter, and Verb 74 Enter. Now if register 1 does read 10000, we'll still have to do the Verb 74 Enter, is that correct?
That's affirmative. That Verb 74 Enter is what starts the dump. Then we, just prior to that, want to make sure we got 10000 in register 1. And just hang loose one on Goldstone here; we're getting it configured.
Roger. You need the High Gain, Mike?
Negative. We won't need the High Gain.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Goldstone is all ready, and you can go ahead with that procedure, Jim.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay. Register 1 reads 10000.
Okay. Thank you. [Pause.]
And do you want the Verb 74 now?
That's fine.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Have you done the Verb 74 Enter yet?
No, I'm waiting for your command.
Okay. I'm sorry; you must have missed it. You can go ahead right now, Jim; we're all set.
Roger. Verb 74. [Pause.]
On its way down.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Jim, the dump is complete. You can go ahead and do whatever you like with your computer now.
Roger. [Pause.]
We're going to be restricted to P23 for a while.
Just don't let Anders touch the computer.
I haven't yet, and I don't plan to.
Roger. We concur with that decision.
Oh, we've just been honored by the presence of Mr. Neil Armstrong who is now standing by the CapCom console, alert and eager.
Roger. Ask him how the stock market's doing.
Tears are rolling down his face.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Well with the computer, we sort of got behind in our promise of music. are you still wanting it?
Go ahead.
Okay.
Just so Neil doesn't accompany it.
I'll enquire. [Long pause.]
Neil says you're in luck; he has a cold today. [Long pause.]
Okay.
Must be the wrong speed. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger, Mike. That's real nice, but if you don't mind, you'd better hold it off until we get this tracking test done. [Garble].
Roger, Bill. We concur. [Pause.]
Sounds like it is [was] being run at the wrong speed. [Pause.]
It doesn't sound very good to us either.
Coming through nicely, though, Mike. You're coming through nicely, Mike; maybe you could just sing a little bit. [Pause.]
Yeah, I'll get my harmonica.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger, Mike. How are our temperatures looking across the Service Module? Could it be Go here for a shoot in another couple sets on this next start?
Yeah, I'm monitoring them. They look real good to me, Bill. Just a second and I will check with the experts. [Pause.] Yeah, you're just fine, Bill, on your quad temps.
And SPS is okay?
Affirmative. SPS is looking good also.
Okay. [Pause.]
Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Mike.
Roger, Bill. Because of this W-matrix thing, we'd like to add some more star sightings when Jim gets through with the series that he's currently on. And I have the information relevant to them when you're ready to copy.
Stand by. [Pause.]
Go ahead.
Okay. This is - we'd like him to do them, as I say, whenever he is through the series he's on now, and they're the same ones that are printed on your Flight Plan page 2-86. The first one, we'd like to increase to two sets; the second one, we'd like to increase to two sets, making a total of five sets on those stars on page 2-86. Do you copy?
Roger. [Pause.]
Okay. The other change...
How come we have to...
...is on an elapsed time of 120 - a hundred and twenty hours: we'd like to increase that P23 work, the first star, change from one set to two sets. The second star from one to two...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Mike.
Okay.
Okay. Looking for the page; I got it now.
Okay. The first star, make two sets; second star, two sets; for a total of five sets.
Okay.
And if you're in a copying mood, I have, would you believe, a couple of changes to your entry checklist which I'd like to read up to you sometime today or tomorrow.
Okay. Why don't we get them here after this one set of stars.
Very good. [Long pause.]
Roger, Bill. I was just given a new one here. While you've got your Flight Plan out, this would be 130 hours GET, and you got that page?
I just put it away, but I'll get it out again. Wait a minute.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that. [Pause.]
We're neat up here. Not sloppy. [Pause.]
Roger. At 130 hours GET, star 02: Where it is printed two sets, we'd like to make that only one set; and then we would like to add star 11, star one - one, lunar far horizon, two sets. Over. [Pause.]
Okay.
Hey, Mike. Is MIT slipping in the back door?
Not - Not really, Jim. It has to do with - with this W-matrix. You remember that we reinitialized it in lunar orbit, and then we worked on it as you came back on the previous sightings you made, and now we've - we've gone and reinitialized it again at this point. And we'd like to restore it to its former size and shape and what-not.
Okay. I understand.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Jim.
Mike, I've got the entry checklist out now. You want to give me that update?
Okay, Bill. Thank you. The first one is on page E-7.
Okay. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Okay, Mike. Ready to go. Now I know why Neil was over there.
No. You can't blame it on him. Page E-7 under CM RCS preheat, halfway down where it says "Up Telemetry, Block" - Are you with me?
I'm with you.
Okay. After Up Telemetry, Block, insert "RCS CM heaters, circuit breakers, two, Close." [Long pause.]
Okay.
All...
Let me get them on both [garbled] we're ready.
...they are doing there is just making sure you get your heater circuit breaker closed. The next one is on page E-9. [Long pause.]
Ready to copy.
Roger. On E-9 up near the top under "terminate CM RCS preheat" in the middle there, after "CM RCS heaters, Off, LMP confirm," insert "RCS CM heaters, circuit breakers, 2, Open." That's just opening those two breakers back up.
Roger.
And the last change is on page 14. [Long pause.]
Okay.
This one should be a favorite of yours. Near the top where it says "tape recorder, Record, Forward" - Are you with me?
Rog.
Insert between "tape recorder" and "Record, Forward," insert "Command Reset, high bit rate." Over. [Long pause.]
Okay. We got them.
Thank you, Bill. That's all.
Okay, Michael. [Pause.]
How's it going? Do you want any systems dope?
Yeah, they hanging together? I haven't even looked at them for the last half an hour. I've been over here in the Sun.
Yeah, they sure are, Bill. They can get you any specific numbers, what-not, if you're interested. [Pause.]
Well, I hate to say I wasn't interested, but I don't need any specific numbers right now.
Okay. Very good. We concur. [Pause.]
That's an aerospace first. [Pause.]
On second thought, how's the evaporator outlet Temp doing? [Long pause.]
Forty-six degrees, Bill.
Cancel that aerospace first.
Right. [Long pause.]
How's Magellan coming along?
I'm getting a crossed eye looking at this thing. Hey, Mike, as a matter of interest, I've been just looking at the Earth for the last hour and a half and there's two tremendous storms down there. Not too sure where they are, but the vortexes are - are huge.
Rog. Understand.
That's your first space weather report. That's a manned weather forecast from space, and he's not so sure where it's raining, but it is raining somewhere.
Rog.
I'd like to point out that Magellan is not a good analogy. I'd also like to point out that Magellan is not a good analogy. I don't think he made it around.
Very good.
How about Alfred Chichister?
Roger. Alf. [Long pause.]
I don't know how much detail you can see, Jim, but your sub-spacecraft point is out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean about halfway between Australia and South America. [Pause.]
Rog. Okay. The next time I take a look, I'll see what I - I see we're maneuvered to the Moon now. [Pause.] We'll see if we can see our shadow. [Pause.]
Seriously, has anyone been able to see the spacecraft from Earth, Optically? [Pause.]
We don't think so, Bill. We haven't been able to confirm that they have.
Okay. [Pause.]
You're coming right down the center line of the airways. If you see the airliners going the other way, you better move over.
That's the first time old Lovell's been on track for a long time.
Rog. [Pause.]
Mike, an interesting viewpoint of the nav sightings: maneuvering with the minimum impulse controller on the way home is a lot more difficult than going out because of all the fuel we don't have now. Every little pulse really moves the spacecraft around.
Rog. Understand you have too much control authority.
Now, yes.
Let Bruce beware.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Jim. Dick Underwood's over here. They're getting their film processing all prepared for your film when you get back and tentatively, can you give us some idea of how much you exposed?
Let me introduce you to the great film man. He'll tell you all about it.
Very good.
Tell him I hope he can account for haze through the windows. We - on our departure from the Moon, we tried to burn up as much as - of what we had left over, which was quite a bit, and tell him I hope he can develop the high-speed film taken at normal film settings. [Long pause.]
Roger. Understand you used just about everything and a lot of the high speed; you used it to normal settings.
Roger. We got it in the wrong bucket there a couple of times.
Okay. [Pause.]
We never did have a chance to do any night Earthshine stuff. [Pause.]
Say again about the Earthshine, Bill.
We never did have a chance to do any Earthshine photography.
Rog. Understand.
