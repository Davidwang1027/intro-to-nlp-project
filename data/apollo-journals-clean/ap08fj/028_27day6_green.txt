Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Good morning, James.
Oh, it's Michael Collins, is it? Good morning to you.
Righto. And we're looking at your pitch CDU read-out down here and looks to us like you are about 25 degrees off the 180 for your PTC, and we were just wondering how come?
We've been looking at that, too. It keeps wandering off in pitch for some reason more than yaw. I was just about ready to go back to it again. I had to go back one time, and I was just seeing how far she'd drift. I thought it would drift out a ways and come back by itself, but it is not doing it.
Okay.
We'll get back there.
Houston, Apollo 8. We're in the process of doing the trunnion bias check; then we'll go to P23.
Roger. Thank you, Frank. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We'd like to have the PTC attitude to comply with P23 requirement.
Roger, Frank. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Any time you want to start on those P23s is just fine.
Okay. I was just checking. I just wanted to know how our thermal control was going before we left. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Your temperatures are looking good, Frank. There's still a differential temperature between quads, but nothing that would cause us in the slightest to worry about doing P23.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, Jim. We've been looking at these stars that we gave you this time for P23. It looks like the second star, number 11, has a trunnion angle right out near the limit, about 49.7 degrees. And we're thinking it might be a better idea to switch you over to star 1, which has a much smaller trunnion angle. What do you think? Star 1 is Alpheratz.
Fine with me; I would just as soon take star 1.
Okay. That will be then; in place of star 11, star 1; and in place of lunar far horizon, lunar near horizon; and it remains two sets. Over.
Roger. Star 1, lunar near horizon, two sets.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. Old golden fingers there is getting so swift we missed some marks on the downlink, and I wonder, if you hand recorded them, could you read us your three marks, trunnion angles, your three trunnion angles on star 2 and the last four trunnion angles on star 1. Over. [Pause.]
Do you read me still, Mike?
Stand by. We're not reading you good enough, so we'll wait until you get a better Omni.
That ought to be a good one.
That is a good one. That's loud and clear.
Okay. Star 2 trunnion angle, first one 05245, second one 05243, next one 05241; last 4 trunnion angles 04133, 04133, 04132, 04132.
Thank you kindly. [Long pause.]
Can you give me some idea of the updates from the midcourse that we might need, and all that good stuff, Mike?
Yeah, I sure can, Frank. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Mike.
Okay. We're predicting at the nominal time of your next midcourse, which is Entry Interface minus 2 hours - we're predicting a 1.4 foot per second burn which changes your gamma at Entry Interface by a tenth of a degree. Right now, with no further maneuvers, your gamma is minus 6.39 degrees. And we're going to steepen it up very slightly to hit the center of the target line, and it will be, after the maneuver, minus 6.51. Over.
Very good.
Anything else you want like that?
No. I just wondered. We hadn't heard whether we were going to do it or not and so on.
Rog.
When we get the PAD data, we'll get it all out here.
Yeah. We'll be sending the PAD data up to you in about another 2 hours, Frank; about 132 hours GET.
Okay. We - this will be the last set of star sightings we do now nominally, and even if we lose comm, we'll just come on in with what we got.
Okay, Frank.
Incidentally, that comm has been fantastic. I don't know how you've heard us, but boy, it was just like you're next door even at lunar distances.
Yeah. It really has been great there, with the rare exception is when you are on a bad Omni right before you switch. Then we get an awful lot of background noise, but in general, it's been excellent, and boy, we're really thankful for it because reading all these updates would be bad news with bad comm, as you know.
Right.
Say, Mike, have you noticed the confidence the Captain has in his navigator?
He hasn't called you Goldfinger yet.
No. He is disregarding anything that I can do. We're coming in anyway. [Pause.]
I suspect he is right on that point.
Well, back to the drawing board.
As usual, we are all a little pooped. I've got Bill sleeping now, and then Jim and I will swap just as soon as we get through with these stars.
Well, you're sounding real good, and you are doing good work.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. If you get a chance to, we'd like for you to read us down your trunnion calibration number. We missed that one on the downlink, and we have an update for your Passive Thermal Control attitude.
Okay. The trunnion calibrations were all zeros.
Roger. Thank you, and on page 2-104, the PTC attitudes should read zero pitch and 45 degrees yaw. Over.
Zero pitch, 45 degrees at 2-104.
Roger. And we'd like some PRD readings for those of you who are up and around. [Long pause.]
Zero pitch, 45 yaw, it is?
Roger. Thank you.
I'm asking that. I didn't - I wasn't sure I copied it right.
Yeah. That's affirmative, Frank. Zero pitch, 45 degrees yaw.
My PRD now reads 2.85.
2.85.
Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. Over.
This is 8. Loud and clear. How us?
Roger. You're loud and clear, Jim. We'd like to get your PRD reading while we've got you up and a Flight Plan change we're suggesting on page 2-107 when you're ready to copy.
Roger. Stand by. [Pause.]
I'm the only person up, and my PRD is reading 0.15.
Roger. Understand; 0.15.
And I'll bet that Bill's is still reading 0.64.
That's okay; don't bother him with it. He's asleep. [Long pause.]
Okay. Go ahead with your Flight Plan change. [No answer.]
Houston, Apollo 8. Go ahead with your Flight Plan change.
Okay, Jim. On page 2-107, we're recommending that you delete that P52 and just stay in PTC attitude. Your platform is real good, and we don't feel that alignment's necessary. One is coming up again at 139 hours anyway. And also, on that same page, we'd like to delete the "begin cabin cold-soak." Over. [Pause.]
Righto. We'll delete the "begin cabin cold-soak," and we'll delete the P52.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Roger, Apollo 8. This is Houston. Over.
Roger. Mike. Are you still planning to send up these updates at 132 hours?
Yes; affirmative, Jim. We're getting them together now.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Would you please go to P00 and Accept, Jim, and we'll send you a P27. [Long pause.]
We're ready for you.
Okay. Sending up a state vector to the LM slots.
Rog.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Jim. You can go back to Block; we got the P27 in and verified. It was a state vector update to the LM slot, and I'm standing by for the midcourse correction number 7 and the entry PAD at your convenience. Over.
Roger. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Go ahead with midcourse number 7.
Okay. Midcourse correction number 7; RCS/G&N; 31600; not applicable, not applicable; 144:45:57.99; minus 0001.4, plus five zeros, plus 0000.1. Are you with me so far? Over.
Roger. With you.
Good. 000, 304, 000; not applicable, 00019.1; 0001.4, 0:04, 0001.4; 45, 0...
Hey, Mike, hold it. Hold it, Mike.
Okay. Holding.
You said not applicable for HA. And HP, I started to copy it down, and then I didn't get the right number sequence. Did you skip down to what, VT?
No. Let's go back to apogee is not applicable, and then I just started reading the numbers again. From there, I've got a perigee and then a Delta-VT and then a burn time and so forth. Over.
Okay. I didn't hear a plus or minus on the HP, and I only got four numbers off of it. So could you start with HP again?
Okay. Going back to apogee, not applicable; perigee, plus 0019.1. And you weren't hearing things; it was my mistake. Over.
Roger.
Okay. Picking up with Delta-VT; 0001.4, 0:04, 0001.4; 45, 045.9, 22.5; Shaula, up 23.6, 00.0; plus 08.13; minus 165.03; 1220.2, 36301, 146:46:41; north set of stars, Sirius and Rigel; roll, 308; pitch, 209; yaw, 357; remarks: perigee in P30 equals plus 22.2 nautical miles. Over.
Roger. Midcourse number 7; RCS/G&N; 31600; not applicable, not applicable; 144:45:57.99. Are you with me?
I'm with you.
Minus 0001.4, plus all zeros, plus 0000.1; 000, 304, 000; not applicable, plus 0019.1; 0001.4, 0:04, 0001.4; 45, 045.9, 22.5; Shaula, up 23.6, 00.0; plus 08.13, minus 165.03; 1220.2, 36301, 146:46:41; Sirius, Rigel, 308, 209, 357; HP in P30 is 22.2 nautical miles.
That's all correct, Jim, and I have the entry PAD at your convenience.
Roger. Stand by one. [Long pause.]
Ready to copy. Mike.
Okay. Entry PAD: the area, mid-Pacific; 357, 152, 359; 146:29:13; 268, plus 08.13, minus 165.03; 068, 36221, 651, 1220.2, 36301, 146:46:13, 0028, not applicable four times, in other words, DL MAX, DL MIN, VL MAX, and VL MIN - all not applicable. Starting with D0: 4.00, 02:07, 00:25, 03:33, 08:16; 16, 059.0, 31.2. And your boresight star, Zeta Persei, which is half way between Mirfak and Aldebaran, up 16.5, right 3.4, up. Remarks: use non-exit EMS pattern. Over. [Pause.]
Right, Mike. Stand by.
Entry as follows: mid-Pacific, 357, 152, 359; 146:29:13; 268, plus 08.13, minus 165.03; 068, 36221, 651, 1220.2, 36301, 146:46:13, 0028, N/A 4 times, with D0 4.00, 02:07, 00:25, 03:33, 08:16; 16, 059.0, 31.2; Zeta Persei, up 16.5, right 3.4; up. And remarks: use non-exit EMS pattern. And Zeta Persei is between Mirfak and Aldebaran, and Frank can never find it anyway.
Okay. That's all correct. [Long pause.]
We certainly don't waste much time getting down to drogue deploy, do we?
Roger. That's, that's true.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Jim. In your computer, we'd like to do an erasable memory dump again, like we did the other day, and the reason we'd like to do it is, when you did that P37 about 8 hours ago, and you remember you put that EI time in for TIG and got that P00-doo thing; we'd like to - We don't think there's anything in the world wrong with it. We think everything is just perfect inside the computer, but we'd like to do an erasable dump as we did the other day; go through it bit by bit. Give us something to do down here. Over.
Okay. Any time.
And I have the procedures for you when you're ready to copy.
Go ahead.
Okay. Verb 01 Noun 01 Enter, 333 Enter, and then read out register 1, and that register 1 should be 10000, 1 0 0 0 0. And then if it's not, I can give you a procedure for getting it to 10000. If it is 10000 as we expect, then Verb 74 Enter, and that'll do the dump. Over.
Roger. When do you want it? [Long pause.]
And, Apollo 8, you can do the first part of that now at your convenience to verify that register 1 is reading 10000, but would you hold up on the dump itself until we get our ground stations configured, please. Over.
Will do.
Jim, we're getting noisy down here. Could you switch Omni antennas, please? [Pause.]
Thank you, sir. [Pause.]
That works pretty well, doesn't it?
Not bad. I was amazed at the communication at the Moon, too. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We're configured for the dump. Verb 74 Enter at your convenience.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. The dump is complete, and it's your computer. Thank you.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over. [Pause.]
Good morning, Mike. We had a little change of the guard here.
You sound all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. How's it going up there?
Real great. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. How about giving us a countdown to PRD. reading. Over?
Just mine?
Yes, just on you, Bill. We got the other two while you were sacked out. [Pause.]
The one that I have now, and the one that Jim took off, which is obviously broken, it's still at 0.64.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger, Bill. On your PTC attitude, we're requesting a pitch angle of zero, and we're showing you about 27 degrees pitch and increasing. Over.
Roger. I've been trying to work it down to Enter again.
They're letting you drive, after all, huh?
I have to every now and then just to square this thing away.
Mike, I'll just give you my status here before the rest of them go to sleep; had about 3 hours sleep, another meal, and everybody is doing fine.
Roger, Bill. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. Over.
Loud and clear.
Rog. Thanks, Bill.
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Roger, Mike. How do you read?
Reading you loud and clear now, Bill. I wasn't hearing here for a couple of calls. How're you reading me?
I had my hands full; I was putting something down. I read you fine.
Okay. Understand. If it'll be any help to you in your PTC driving, we've computed that as you look out plus-X in the COAS or just out the window, you should be pointed right at Acrux when you're in a perfect PTC attitude. We don't know whether that's a help to you or not, but we thought you might enjoy trying an alternate mode of keeping the attitude under control.
Okay. From my present position, we're going to have to move Acrux a little bit. [Pause.]
Well, whatever you think. We just thought you might appreciate knowing. [Pause.]
I'll give it a try, Mike. I can see Acrux...
Can you see it all right?
Yeah, I think so. There's a star out there anyway.
Houston, Apollo 8. Do you read?
Go ahead, Bill.
Actually, Mike, it's so easy to do it with the eight-ball within a reasonable sloppy limit that it's hardly worth the trouble to scootch way up to the seat to look out the COAS, and it's enough light in the cockpit where the star really isn't too easy to see. So I'm kind of inclined to use the IFR technique here where you can see the rest of the instrument panel.
Okay. [Long pause.]
I thought you were an all-weather pilot.
Well, you just caused Flight down here to get a "Gotcha" on CapCom and FAO. [Pause.]
Give me a little warning next time.
Apollo 8, Houston. Could you give us a better Omni, please? [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We'll be changing the antennas in 3 minutes. You can expect a comm glitch. Over.
Okay, Mike.
Apollo 8, Houston. Could you switch us to Omni Charlie, please. [Long pause.]
Thank you, sir.
De nada. [You are welcome.]
Houston, Apollo 8. [No answer.]
Houston, Apollo 8. You still there?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
I was just seeing if you were still there, Mike. Old Gray Eagle has taken over the Hail Mary. [Pause.]
Which one of them? [Pause.]
Old Super Chief.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Bill. We had an erasable memory dump, few hours back. I think it was while you were asleep, but anyway we've checked the computer's erasable memory bit by bit, and everything agrees 100 percent. Over.
Mighty fine. Glad to hear it, Mike. Thank you.
Rog. [Pause.] You gonna brief Frank on your tape recorder before you go to sleep?
He can't handle it. It's too complicated.
Rog.
Apollo 8, Houston. Give us a different Omni, please. [Pause.]
Thank you, sir.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Michael.
Rog. We're going to switch our ground antennas in about a minute and a half. You can expect a comm glitch, Frank.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Were you transferring from Honeysuckle, Mike?
Apollo 8, this is Houston through Carnarvon. Were you calling a minute ago, Frank? [Pause.]
Y'all in Australia, do you hear us?
Yeah, we're reading you loud and clear now. [Long pause.]
Carnarvon, how do you read Apollo 8?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Reading you loud and clear through Carnarvon. [Long pause.]
Hello, Houston.
Go ahead, Frank.
We're just listening to all the guys around the net.
Can you hear them?
I could that time, all the way from Carnarvon to Texas. [Pause.]
How'd they ever get an old maintenance officer on the midnight shift? [Long pause.]
Frank, you're on GOSS Conference if you'd like to debrief. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Omni Bravo, please. [Long pause.]
Thank you, sir.
Houston, Apollo 8. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Have you noticed how long I've stayed locked in in this PTC mode? [Long pause.]
Just about an hour and a quarter looks to us like, Frank.
I haven't even touched the hand control here for about 20 minutes, and it just hasn't moved outside that zero; I've never seen it like this before. [Pause.]
Be sure and have your troops give me a call if it gets close to gimbal lock, will you? I'm snoozing a little bit now and then up here.
Yeah, we sure will, Frank.
Thank you. [Pause.]
And if you'd switch the antennas, you'd really be good guys.
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8.
Roger. Just a check on the radio, and if it's practical, Biomed switch, left, please.
Okay, Mike. We got a new change in the watch again.
Yeah, that was quick. Did you decide you didn't want to sleep after all?
Wasn't my decision.
Yeah, that's what I figured.
Apollo 8, Houston. We'll be changing antennas in about 2½ minutes; you can expect a comm glitch.
Roger. What are you changing to? [Pause.]
We're switching from Carnarvon to Honeysuckle, Bill.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Apollo 8. Your Green Team will be signing off in a few minutes, and before we do, Charlesworth and the rest of us would like to say we've enjoyed it and look forward to seeing you back in Houston. Over.
We have sure enjoyed it, too, troops, and you guys have really done a good job. Really do appreciate it.
Well, nice words there. We'll be seeing you, Bill.
Okay, Mike. We'll see you, Buddy. [Pause.] Tell old Cliff adios for me, too.
Sure will.
