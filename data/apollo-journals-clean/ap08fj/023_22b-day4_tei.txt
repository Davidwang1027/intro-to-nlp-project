I should see Peacock rise over that - I'm just amazed the way this thing operates.
A pretty fantastic week, isn't it?
Going to get better.
Yeah.
This is utterly fantastic, though. This pawl line is lined up exactly with Gruis.
You know what I think made me sick that night?
What?
That damned pill I took.
What pill did you take?
Seconal - one of the big ones
Oh, is that right?
I didn't know you had small ones. I'd have taken one of those.
Maybe you got the flu.
Maybe I did, I don't know, but it seems like you guys would have gotten it.
Well. I think that basically your stomach was just upset because you can get it very easily. There's nothing wrong, you know.
Yeah, I know, but I never had it before, not even in zero-g airplane, which is a - a real...
I hope this baby holds out for another 2½ days. It sure has performed admirably, hasn't it?
Yep.
Gentlemen, Peacock should be rising above the Moon right now.
And there it is. Just a minute, And I'll verify it.
Okay, I confirm Peacock.
Okay, Bill, checklist.
Okay.
You can leave that off - Looks like we're going to be burning in the daylight anyway.
Okay. Drive trunnion [to] less than 5 degrees.
Okay. Optics, zero, zero.
And G&N Power Optics, Off.
Optics, zero. Don't hit the IMU switch; Optics, Off.
Okay, why don't you - Frank, you can have your lights ups I guess - Unless you wanted to check your star.
Too late, I'm not checking.
Frank, let me come down the other side.
I doubt if I'll be able to.
No, I mean around the other side.
I guess you probably won't; you'll be pitched into the Moon, won't you?
Yeah, that's the trouble, I - I just barely get - then when I do see it, I see a lit horizon.
Okay, Verb 37, Enter; 40, Enter.

Okay, align spacecraft roll to GDC. You got...
Okay.
16 minutes. Do you went to wait awhile to do this?
Well, It's already aligned. I'll do it now, Bill - I don't think I'll have to do much - Put in a little bit of yaw that way.
Okay, align spacecraft roll and GDC aligned. We'll trim it again here - before the burn.
Stability Control System's circuit breakers, panel 8. Closed.
Alright. Now, let's watch this, Jim.
Direct ullage.
Don't want to leave that, out.
I'm going to check mine over here, too.
They're all Closed.

Alright.
For 13 minutes.
Boy, it's blacker than pitch out here.
Yeah, I know it.
Okay, (yawn) you're going to burn with the lights on anyway, aren't you, because you've got to get sunlight.
Probably will, yeah.
Yeah, I watched the Sun - I watched that star rise, and I could just see the black horizon of the Moon fade away and the star come up and - right on it.
Okay, if we get a Main A or an AC1 failure, you change gimbal drives, right?
Okay.
You got a Main B or an AC 2 failure, don't change gimbal drives or do anything, except put your gimbals to - from Auto to 1.
(Singing)
Do you see anything hanging around that could come down?
I hope not.
Tell you one thing these flights are good for: an old fatty like me, I bet I lost a lot of weight. I didn't eat much those first two days. and I didn't - didn't even get much to eat today.
When is the ignition, 89:19, huh?
Mmm hmm.
Pretty sunrise.
Yeah.
I'm doing a P23 right after we leave this place, huh?
Yeah.
Is it boiling, Bill?
No, I hope not. It looks low. It's just cold in there.
It does look a little low. When did I say I had the star?
What time?
Huh?
Because we still have 60 degrees to go there, if we want to be parallel - perpendicular - horizontal to the horizon.
Perpendicular (laughter)!
The horizontal, because I was 60 degrees down and I - I just saw the...
We're still looking at the Moon - flat at the Moon.
Well, not really.
Not flat at it.
I hope not.
Oh, no, not flat at it, but boy, it's black out there.
If you don't got G&N ignition, what are you going to do?
Direct SPS.
Wouldn't it be smart to take it around again?
Why? If we didn't got it this time, why would we get it better the next time?
The burn...
There's a 10-degree excursion on this thing.
Make sure you hit the corridor.
You're right. It would be smart to take it around again.
Get set up to do an SPS burn, huh?
Auto SPS.
I haven't looked at your G - you might still be able to get...
Wait a second; let me check it.
...get G&N errors.
(singing, whistling)
Now, you should see something. Yeah, there it comes.
Where do you see it?
6 minutes to recheck.
Oh, yes, it...
I see it off the side of the terminator from sunrise.
I wonder if that - that sort of a zodiacal light was a glare off the optics, or something.
You ought to draw a little picture of it, and people could tell you what it was.
You got the gimbal thing handy right off the bat?
Yeah, why don't we write that down?
Minus 0...
(LMP?) 40 plus 157.
Is it 157? Not 151?
I'll check on the 11 PAD. 157.
Okay.
...in there.
I bet we had the - The weight hadn't - the trim hadn't - changed any since the last time. (Laughter). Getting worried there for a minute.
We've been eating a lot of food.
Let's see now, that's 2 - 2 minutes and 13 seconds. Is that what we said? 2:18.
138 seconds.
2:18 must give you a slow return home.
Yeah.
You got your strut in?
Yeah. it's in.
Probably, one of the things we've been hearing is these oxygen masks snapping up and down.
Boy, it took three acts of Congress to get those little strings.
Oh. That - that's peculiar, isn't it?
Yeah, looks to me like we're going right at it. Doesn't it look like that to you?
Why is it we do all these burns upside down?
So you can see.
(Laughter) You want to look at that?
(Laughter)
If it makes you feel bad, look out the side windows.
Yeah, that makes it look better.
I've got - coming up on 10 minutes.
Okay, 9 minutes, right now on...
Mark.
(singing)
Hey, don't forget your ullage.
Yeah, Geeze, don't let me forget that.
How many seconds do you need?
15 seconds.
Four-jet ullage.
Okay, we better write that down.
Ullage will be at 89:19:01. Okay?
Yes. You're going to call it off, right?
Well, I'll try to remember - Got it in there.
Oh, yeah.
Yes. Ullage as required down there, I guess. You'll see 15 seconds right on here.
15 seconds.
Yes.
[Garble].
All it does is let you see whether it's there or not; then if it is, it doesn't do anything.
Yeah, I know, but it drifts off a little. The deadband affects it, I guess.
Oh.
Boy, you think you're going to burn right into the - water - I mean, right into the sand.
Did you have trouble scooping up those type of rocks? You said you went up to West Texas for that.

Hey, listen. It looks to me like I'm going to burn right into the ground. Oh! There's the horizon. Hurry! We're going the right way.
Boy. You sure can't tell when you're...
3.2 degrees at TIG Minus 3.
What is it?
3.2 degrees at TIG minus 3 - right about now.
Okay, I can - It looks good.
We've got to arm this Translational Hand Controller. Did you tell me to do that?
Then we've got to ullage.
Yeah.
Okay, coming up on 2½ minutes.
Okay, 5 seconds after you start, get Delta-V Thrust B, On. Okay?

Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Hello, Apollo 8. Loud and clear.
Roger. Please be informed there is a Santa Claus.
That's affirmative.
You're the best ones to know.
And burn status report: it burned on time; Burn time, 2 minutes, 23 seconds; seven-tenths plus VGX. Attitude nominal, residuals; minus five-tenths VGX, plus four-tenths VGY, minus 0 VGZ; Delta-VC, minus 26.4.
Roger.
FIDO, Flight have ...
Apollo 8, could you comfirm your burn time, please? [Pause.]
Roger. We had 2 minutes, 23 seconds. Our - wait one. [Pause.] Stand corrected to that; 3 minutes, 23 seconds.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
You get the sensation that you're climbing, Ken.
Say again, Apollo 8.
I say, this gives you the sensation that you're climbing.
Rog. [Pause.]
. What's next on the docket?
High Gain Antenna!! [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, at the first convenient moment, we'd like to have the High Gain Antenna.
You've got it; you're on the High Gain.
Rog.
Apollo 8, Houston. We do not have any data on the ground yet; the voice looks very good.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We'd like to try to have you manually acquire on the High Gain.
Okay.
And this will take a wide beamwidth.
Wide beamwidth. Roger.
Houston. Apollo 8. We've manually acquired in wide beam.
Roger. Reading you loud and clear. Initial tracking indicates a 4 foot per second at 8 hours [probably after TEI] will put you on target.
4 foot per second at 8 hours.
Correction, that's 15 hours.
Roger. Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, we have data; we'd like to have the tape recorder.
You can have it.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. Do you wish me to reinitialize the W-matrix at this time? [Pause.]
That's affirmative, Apollo 8.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. Which battery do you want us to start charging? [Pause.]
Okay. We'd like to start on battery Alpha.
Battery Alpha. Okay. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, would you go to narrow beam on High Gain? [Long pause.]
We're in narrow beam.
Roger. Sounds real good now.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. If you'll go to P00 and Accept, we'll update the REFSMMAT, and I have some backup GDC angles for the new entry REFSMMAT.
Roger. Understand; P00 and Accept, and you'll give us a new REFSMMAT.
Affirm. [Long pause.]
Okay. Houston, you have the Accept.
Roger. Your backup GDC alignment; roll, 308; pitch, 209; yaw, 357. Over.
On what set of stars?
That's on Sirius and Rigel. [Pause.]
Understand; roll, 308; pitch, 209; yaw, 357.
That's affirmative, Apollo 8. [Long pause.]
Morning, Apollo 8. Deke here. I'd just would like to wish you all a very Merry Christmas on behalf of everyone in the Control Center, and I'm sure everyone around the world. None of us ever expect to have a better Christmas present than this one. Hope you get a good night's sleep from here on and enjoy your Christmas dinner tomorrow; and look forward to seeing you in Hawaii on the twenty-eighth.
Okay, leader. We'll see you there. That was a very, very nice ride, that last one; this engine is as smooth as glass.
Yeah, we gathered that. Outstanding job all the way around.
Thank everybody on the ground for us. It's pretty clear we wouldn't be anywhere if we didn't have them doing it or helping us out here.
We concur on that.
I concur too. [Pause.]
Even Mr. Kraft does something right once in a while. [Pause.]
He got tired of waiting for you to talk and went home.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. The computer is yours, and I guess we have an IMU alignment and a P23 on the schedule.
Okay. Thank you. Do an IMU alignment coming up. CM in Block.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We'd like to have you cycle your zero optics switch prior to beginning P52.
Roger. We're gonna see if we can find some stars here before we do this P52.
Rog. And, I got a couple of words for you. Jack (Schmitt)'s been watching you since LOI, and he has a few words he wanted to give you.
Go ahead.
Typhoid Jack here, and we've got some good words here that originated at the Cape with a bunch of friends of yours. And it's sort of in a paraphrase of a poem that you're probably familiar with. Do you read me, Apollo 8?
You're loud and clear, Jack.
Okay.
Thank you very much. That was a very good poem; but in order to win the race, you have got to end up on the carriers.
We'll see you there.
Hey, Jack. You really got Bill trained. [Laughter.]
Okay.
I certainly hope so.
You did pretty well, Jim. You must have talked on the way out there. [Laughter.]
Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. We got an alignment with your new REFSMMAT now. What's on the program here? You want us in P23 and then what?
Looks like some sleep's coming up.
That's what I wanted you to say. We used up the gimbal angles of 10 and 45 with the - this REFSMMAT, right?
Affirmative.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Rog. Notice that you're starting on your P23 which is the last scheduled activity. Initial tracking looks like the initial midcourse may be less than the 4-foot-per-second on the first guess. And we've looked at your burn data, and it's all just as smooth as you said; everything on there looked real nominal. Systems now look good; looks like in PTC attitude, we should be able to switch omni's for you, if you would like to do that. We were having good success with predicting, on the way out, where to switch the antennas; and if it'll help you, why, we can do that on the way back in.
That'd be nice if you could do it, but we will keep one man at the shop to watch the gimbal angles; but if you could switch the ang - the omnis, it would sure save us a lot of problems.
Okay. We'll do that. When you get in that PTC attitude, why, we'll - we'll let you know when we're taking command on the omni antenna switching.
Okay. [Pause.] Just be careful what you do with the tape recorder. Bill's a little sensitive about that.
Rog. We were listening to the tape dumps, and it looks like Bill gets a happy new year after all. [Pause.]
A happy new year? How come, again. Is that an in joke?
No, we got that off of his tape dump; he and Jim were discussing that one.
Oh, yeah. That's right.
Houston, are you getting all this data from P23? [No answer.]
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
I wanted to know if you're getting the data from P23?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Eureka!
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Hey - hey Ken, we've about run out of gas here on this next set of stars. Would you ask your people to be especially alert there watching the systems tonight?
Sure will, Frank.
Okay. It's maneuver to pitch 10 and yaw 45.
Roger. I have - let's see, we've got a hydrogen purge line here that ought to come on about 91:40 and an oxygen-hydrogen fuel cell purge for 92 hours. [Pause.]
Okay. Will you call us about those, please?
I sure will. And, let's see, we just wanted to let you know we've got a real good battery charge going here this time. Looks like - it looks just like the ones in the book, and I'd like to get a battery C voltage before you shut down and a sleep report on what you did in...
Okay.
...lunar orbit and your plans for the next couple of hours.
Okay. [Long pause.]
37 volts on battery C.
Roger. 37 volts. [Pause.]
We only got about 2 hours sleep today, max. Ken. We're going to now - Bill's going to stay up awhile, and Jim and I are going to sack out, then we're going to try to rotate to short sleep cycles till we can get back to the normal ones.
Roger, sounds like a good idea. And EECOM on the ground tells us that the flying EECOM (is) to go ahead and put his hydrogen purge line heater on, and we'll get ready for a fuel cell.
Thank you. He can't turn on his radio. There he goes. [Pause.]
I hope it won't disappoint anybody too much if we knock off those last two stars, but Jim is just in a daze, and so am I.
Rog. No sweat.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8. One of the things we'd like to have before you shut down also is a Verb 64 so we can watch these pointing angles.
Roger.
Hey, Frank, you might be interested; they are having some trouble with the medics' pee tube.
What?
The medics can't clean out their pee tube. [Pause.]
Oh, is that right? It's been so busy.
Oh, yeah. It's worn the thing out at the bearings. [Laughter, Long pause.]
Hey, Ken, tell the people if you see anything getting close to the gimbal lock to be sure and whistle, too, will you?
We sure will, Frank. You will want to make sure one of you keeps your comm carrier on.
We'll keep one man with a headset on.
That's right. We'll keep one man with a comm carrier on.
Apollo 8. You have got some big yaw angle there. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Copy that you are now in the PTC attitude, and we're watching your gimbal angle. We apparently do not have a downlink voice, but the data is good. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Loud and clear, 8. [Pause.]
Okay. We're establishing PTC. We took one last look at the Moon and are on our way back.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. In order for us to handle the antenna switching, I guess we'd like to have the Aux Tape switched to Off, and the Tape Forward switch, Off; and we'll be switching between omnis Bravo and Delta. [Long pause.]
Between what and what?
Okay. We're going to be switching between omnis Bravo and Delta.
Okay.
All right. And I'm gonna - you bug me when you get over 50 degrees of yaw, so I'll probably be watching that number pretty closely. We'd like to have the Biomed switched to the right position. [Long pause.] Okay. And for your own information: the fuel we show in the different quads I have here if you'd like to copy it.
Stand by.
Okay. Ready to copy.
Okay. I'll give you the percentage. On Alpha, 60; Bravo, 57; Charlie...
Wait a minute. It asks for present time, and I can't plot that fast, Ken.
Okay. I'm sorry. Alpha is 60.
For what time?
91:36. [Pause.]
Okay. Stand by. [Pause.]
Okay. What's Bravo?
Okay. That's 57. [Pause.]
Okay.
Charlie, 62. [Long pause.]
Okay.
And Delta, 57.33842. [Pause.]
That's a coincidence. That's just what I worked out on Lovell's slide rule. [Pause.]
How are we doing on the cryos?
Oh, you've got some pretty good numbers on that today. Sent up yesterday, and you had about 160 hours. Well, I'll check that out, but you were fat on cryo. I've got some SPS Delta-V. You've got 3,320. You fly the Service Module RCS through the DAP, you have 142; and through SCS, it's 121. [Long pause.]
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We can't monitor on low bit rate whether you started your fuel cell purge. If you haven't, we can go ahead and start now; and if you keep us posted as you go through it.
Roger. You want an O2 and an H2 purge, Ken?
That's affirmative.
You shall have it.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. [Pause.]
Go ahead.
Looks like you may be in omni Alpha. Can you confirm that we're set up to switch between Bravo and Delta? [Long pause.]
You are now.
Okay. Thanks very much. And you are in the fuel cell purge?
It's complete.
Okay. Understand the purge is complete. Thank you. And in reference to your cryo, looks like we'll have 180 pounds in each oxygen tank at Sep and 11 pounds in each hydrogen tank. And you're well above the single tank capability. [Long pause.]
Okay. Thank you.
