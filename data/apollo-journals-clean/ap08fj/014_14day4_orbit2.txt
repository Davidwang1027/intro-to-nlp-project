Mag H - When you're through taking Mag H, I'll [garble].
Mag H was on the 16-millimeter cam...
[Garble].
...16-millimeter camera, run at one frame per second, at - Look at that f-stop.
8.
On f/8 through the entire Rev.
We now have Mag - What was that again, J? - Mag J installed for the second pass.
Are you all set with the TV, Bill?
Oh, we've got a long time.
The TV doesn't come until at 30 minutes [garble].
Next - next AOS?
[Garble] the Flight Plan.
Next AOS is 30.
71:39,
Yes.
71:30 would be [garble].
[Garble] half an hour.
Is that right?
Yes.
Well, I guess we don't do [garble].
No, we can't do them all at once.
All at once?
[Garble] the Earth [garble].
No.
Are you going to [garble]?
I think you better yaw first [garble].
What was that time again? 71:30?
You don't have AOS until 71:39 [garble].
Well, 12.2 is [garble] 128.
[Garble] TV pass is [garble].
Well, I guess we could got it; you know this S-band is actually just pointing a little - a little more underneath than ...
Okay, Bill, while we're going around here...
How's your time? Sunrise is 71:00
Holy cow! We're not too far away from [garble].
[Garble] right? Ask Jim.
Okay. Did you see my [garble]?
[Garble] camera [garble].
What does - what does it say there in the Flight Plan, Frank?
Hey, Frank, think I should share your [garble] the next [garble] because you're going to maintain the position, aren't you?
[Garble].
I should get over there. - Could you fly it from over here?
Huh?
Now you've got to maintain a position in the [garble].
Well, that's just to [garble] whenever we fly [garble] with the COAS [garble].
Trying to get up here.
Well, look here. [Garble].
It doesn't say anything; about that.
One frame per second [garble] terminator.
Let me see if I can get up here [garble]. Yes, I just [garble].
What do you want me to do?
What do you want to do about this television?
[Garble].
Well, you can go on and describe where we are.
Still got that [garble], Bill?
I don't see it.
Bill, why don't you just worry about the television as far as [garble].
You see the terminator yet, Frank?
Yes.
Are you pitched down - to the horizon?
Yes, down.
Okay, I've got the terminator.
All right, the terminator is just coming over right now.
You want your camera going, Bill?
Start at - just start it a little past the, terminator.... Don't start a track until you get the terminator.
Okay, let me [garble].
Well, I thought we've better - Bill you've got - I guess you've got your instrument, right?
What's the crater just before we get the terminator? The big one?
It's America.
No, no, that's the real big one.
It's...
It's the one that's coming up right now.
Von Braun and America.
This one right down here, Bill? Bill? Is that von Braun?
Yes [garble].
I think this is Freeman coming up.
Have you got the terminator?
Yes.
It might be [garble]; no, I think it's Freeman.
Just run it whenever you are looking down there.
[Garble] take a look at [garble] the Flight Plan.
Give me that Flight Plan there real quick, will you, Frank?
Okay, let's track along the ground and run the camera [garble] time.
Here - It'll - At the terminator, it will be - 2.8, and it'll stay that way for a good while.
[Garbled.]
[Garble], we're looking good.
Okay, starting on the right now, [garble].
No, no, no, don't - don't write it down.
Well, you're going to get...
No, it - it - Wait, wait'll it comes up...
Well, why not? Why don't you get it tracking? That thing's just going into the terminator.
Well, I'd wait, or you're never going to make it through the pass. It's the other terminator that's more important. Just take a couple here, Frank.
All right. We should be over America right now.
Now, we're passing over America.
There she is.
And we're coming up on von Braun.
Okay, we're to the north of our track...
Yes.
...aren't we? No, we're not! My gosh, we're just about on it!
Now, can you turn up the lights a little bit because we need this thing because we're going to - turn the light [garble].
We're coming [garble] right now [garble].
You want this thing going now, Bill?
Yes, good.
3.5 still [the required F-stop on the lens]?
Huh?
Yes.
I don't think the angle is the best, though.
[Garbled.)
Oh, you can see out of this one. Bill, this is good lighting for one of those.
Take those pictures [garble.]
Okay, we got the six pictures of the terminator, south.
That's the north, Jim. Isn't this America sitting right out here - this big one? Or did you...
No, no, we're over - still over America right now. See look at this big picture. I've got the - I've got the photograph on...
Is this von Braun right here, this big...
No, we're right in the middle of America, right now.
You've got two other craters sticking up [garble].
Right in the middle of it? Are they those...
You still want it 3.5, Bill? I think I...
I want you to keep it 2.8 until we've gone 7 minutes. [Garbled.)
Yes, I know. It doesn't work; it goes out.
There is the big [garble] down below us.
Is that it?
Yes. [Garble] down south right now.
Why, the rim of America is very hard to see, isn't it?
Yes.
Yes.
Okay, you're right, here's von Braun. This must be von Braun, here.
Yes, okay.
Boy, it sure feels like you're running [garble]. Very pretty.
Okay, getting target 10.
Target 10 is mag D, frame...
You should have a big crater on the side of you there.
Okay.
There it is. Now the target should be just straight ahead.
[Garble] target 12.
I see it. Right there.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [Pause.]
Houston, this is Apollo 8 with the TV going. Over. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Reading you loud and clear. We see your TV. It's a little bit - little bit clearer.
Roger. The Moon is very bright and not too distinct in this area. I'll give you a shot of the horizon.
Roger.
How's that look? Is it on the top of your picture?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. It's a good picture - the horizon - we can't see many terrain features as yet. [Pause.]
Roger. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We're beginning to pick up a few craters very dimly. The whole thing is pretty bright.
Roger. There's not much definition up here either out on the horizon. We're now approaching the craters See [Alden] and Bassett [Scaliger].
Roger. [Pause.]
I'll shift to the rendezvous window.
Roger, Bill.
Apollo 8, Houston. We want to take the DSE.
Roger. You've got it.
Roger. Looks like we've got a real good picture now.
Okay, that's the crater Brand [Danjon].
Roger. [Pause.]
Sorry, we missed Carr [Perepelkin].
Me too. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We're going to need a cryo fan cycle sometime during this pass.
Roger. Can we wait 'til sunset?
Roger. We can wait.
Okay. I think we are coming up on Mueller [Meitner] right now. [Long pause.]
There's a very new bright impact crater. Should be in the field of view now.
Roger, Bill.
You see it in the upper part of your screen.
Say, Bill. How would you describe the color of the Moon from here?
The color of the Moon looks, ah, a very whitish gray, like dirty beach sand, and with lots of footprints in it.
Don't these new craters look like pick-axes striking concrete creating a lot of fine haze dust? [Pause.]
There's some interesting features out on the other window. Let me switch windows on you now.
Roger, Bill. [Pause.]
You should see the horizon now in the top of your picture.
Roger. We have the horizon, Bill. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
I believe these are the craters now Bassett [Scaliger] and See [Alden].
Roger, Bill. If you have the polarizing filter handy, try flipping it in front, would you?
Roger.
Jerry, as a matter of interest, there's a lot of what appears to be very small new craters that have these little white rays radiating from them.
Roger, Jim. [Long pause.]
Roger. We see the filter going over. [Pause.] Apollo 8, this is Houston. Looks like we have too much light. The polarizing filter doesn't help much. Go ahead and remove it again. [Pause.]
Roger. It's removed. [Pause.]
Looks like we just got...
Roger. We're just passing over the crater Borman [Pasteur], and there's Anders [Backlund] out there, Lovell [Hilbert] is right south of it.
Roger. TV is breaking up now. Okay. We are back with a good picture. Looks like we just have too much light. Our definition is rather weak.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Also, I'm fogging up the window here, Houston, among other problems.
Roger, Bill. The other window is better than this one.
Okay. [Pause.]
Yeah, much better picture, Bill. Much better.
All right. The right side of the camera is pointing retrograde. [Pause.] We are now passing abeam of the crater Houston [Sklodowska]. And I'll shine the camera over there once for the folks in Texas.
Roger. [Pause.]
It's a big and sprawly one; It's got those two impact craters, one to the right and one to the left.
Roger, Bill. [Pause.]
How's your picture?
Still about the same, Bill. It's - The terrain's pretty bright. We're not getting much definition at all. [Pause.] Definition on this side is much, much better.
Okay, I think - Okay. We are leaving the window. That gives you an idea how bad our window is.
Roger. This picture now is much better. I guess the light levels are decreasing now.
Okay, we are coming up on the crater Collins [Brunner].
Roger. What crater is that that's just going off (out of the frame).
That's some small impact crater.
Roger.
We'll call it John Aaron's.
Okay.
If he'll keep looking at the systems anyway.
He just quit looking. [Long pause.]
Jerry, another of ID feature: these small impact craters have dark spots in the center, where it appears that they buried in it and hit some new material down below and scattered a lot of fine white dust around them. [Long pause.]
, Roger. Understand, Jim. [Pause.]
This - ah, Houston - Apollo 8, This is Houston. Looks like we can see Collins [Brunner] now.
Roger, there is Collins [Brunner] for you.
And Collins [Brunner] is right on the edge of Smythe's Sea which we're about to pass over.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8. This is...
We are now going across the Smythe Sea. Go ahead.
Roger. We just saw a Stellenword [?] go by.
Rog. He was really in a hurry.
Roger. Picture is much improved now. Getting better all the time.
Roger. The terrain here is, as you can see, not well defined. [Pause.] We're going to start a roll to the left, in order to come across the target area, with the television...
Roger.
...landing site area.
Roger, Bill. [Long pause.]
How is that crater in - right in the middle look now?
Roger. That's a very good one; that must be O'Neill.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Roger, Bill. We see O'Neill real well. Also the smaller crater off to the side of it.
That's Dennis.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Houston. This is Apollo 8. We're going to terminate our program for this pass and get on with preparations for LOI-2, if you say we're Go.
Apollo 8. This is Houston. Roger.
Okay. Signing off until the ninth rev. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Thank you for the look.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. You have the DSE.
Thank you, Houston.
Roger. Apollo 8, on your backside data, it's pretty much unintelligible. We suggest, Bill, that you recheck the position of your mike for your backside pass and try to speak a little bit louder and more distinctly. The last one we listened to was pretty much unintelligible. Over.
Roger. As soon as we get squared away, we'll give you a real quick real-time summary.
Roger. [Long pause.]
And, Houston, you might let us know, can we do the red/blue filter exercise with both of these filters - red filters on. Over.
Stand by. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Apollo 8, Houston. Negative. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston with an LOI-2 maneuver PAD. Ready to copy?
Stand by.
Roger. Standing by. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. Go ahead.

Apollo 8, this is Houston. Your map update for rev 2/3, no change. Over.
Understand. No change, revs 2/3.
Roger, Frank. You can expect Go/No Go for the next rev at 20 minutes before LOS Over.
Roger. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We'll try to make that call 20 minutes before every LOS Over.
Fine. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We have the CSM vector in, starting on the LM. Over. [Long pause.]
Thank you. [Pause.]
Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. Just an interesting feature: on my center window, which has ice on it, it is now beginning to melt. I'm beginning to see through it.
Roger. That's good news.
And again we're directly over our favorites, Messier and Pickering (Messier A). [Long pause.]
The view at this altitude, Houston, is tremendous. There's no trouble picking out features that we learned on the map.
Roger, Jim, that's good news. What do you think of the lighting situation as far as the range of lighting for good visibility?
The range from here is outstanding. I wish we had the TV still going because the brown area now is darker. We're just past over the Sea of Fertility, and the mare is darker. The mountain range has got more contrast, has more contrast because of the Sun angle. Bill's got the 16-mm going for us.
Roger.
There is a crater, Taruntius, I believe, over there. [Long pause.]
We'll try to get TV on this at a later time, when we are not getting ready for a burn.
Roger, Jim. [Pause.]
I can see the old second initial point here very well, Mount Marilyn.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Houston, at these Sun angles, everything is quite distinct; shadows are good; the ground doesn't have any Sun that returned. It appears very good visibility from these Sun angles.
Roger. [Long pause.]
As a matter of fact, Bill just mentioned that the visibility seems to be excellent just about up to the terminator. It's something which I didn't expect. I thought there'd be a little bit more gradual shift to darkness, but it's very sharp and distinct.
Roger, Jim.
Of course, we're in a very high phase angle now.
Apollo 8, Houston. All of your updates are in; the computer is yours. Over.
Thank you. [Pause.]
The update block.
Roger. Break. Apollo 8, Houston. Your TEI-2 PAD is good; stand by to copy your TEI-3. Over. [Long pause.]
We're ready for TEI-3.

Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. I made one mistake; horizon window is minus one degree. Over.
Minus one degree.
Roger. Readback is correct. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. You're Go across the board for LOI-2. We'd like to take the DSE for a dump. Over.
Roger. You got it. I understand we are Go for LOI-2.
That's affirmative.
Before you take the DSE for a dump, let me give you a quick - let me give you a quick rundown on the DSE before you dump it, if you will.
Roger. Standing by.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. You've got the tape.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Would you believe that Taurus, Aida is the Pleiades? Over.
Thank you.
Have you got the tape dumped, Houston? We're about to lose the High Gainer. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We're dumping now - looks like we'll be five or ten more minutes. [Pause.]
Okay. Try to get it dumped, and I'll play it, rewind it if necessary.
Roger. Copy. [Long pause.]
We are about to lose it [the HGA], Houston. How far are you on the tape dump? [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Looks like we've lost it, they weren't quite done. We're standing by for a countdown to Biomed switch left. Over.
Roger. Look, we would like to get it dumped if we could. Stand by a second.
Okay.
Did you get it stopped? [Pause.]
Bill, you can go ahead and turn it off. [Long pause.]
Okay. We're not going to have High Gain now until the next time around. Can you give me an idea of how much of that pass you got.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We - negative. We can't tell. You can go ahead and turn it off.
Well, how long did you - did you dump it?
Roger. Stand by; they're checking. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. [Pause.]
Go ahead Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston reading you with a great deal of noise in the background. Go ahead and rewind your tape and start it in low bit rate, and we'll try and catch that dump at the end of the next rev. [Long pause.]
Roger, I would like to have an idea on how much you dumped. So I know whether [garbled) all these things or whether we have better setting in.
Roger. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We're working on that time. We should be able to tell you before LOS. Over. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. Did you read my last?
That's affirmative, Jerry. You'll give us a rundown when you figure out how much tape you dumped.
Roger. They feel reasonably sure, however, that if you rewind and start low bit rate, we'll be able to get all of the burn and still not run into what needs to be downlinked yet.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. What REFSMMAT are we using for this LOI-2 burn? [Long pause.]
Stand by, Frank. We're talking.
Okay, I notice it's an LOI-2 REFSMMAT. If it is, I don't understand why the pitch is 175.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. You're right; the REFSMMAT is LOI-2. The REFSMMAT was determined out there before the last midcourse correction, and since that time, there's been a slight change in your trajectory, and the point at which you're burning LOI-2 now is just a shade different than where it was originally planned. Over.
Okay, thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [No answer.]

Roger. Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. DSE is rewound, and it's yours - available for use is about one hour of low bit rate and two minutes of high bit rate for your burn without running over your good data. Over. [Long pause.]
Roger. Do you read us now, Houston.
Roger. Reading you loud and clear now.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. You're Go for LOI-2 on the next rev. Over.
Roger. Understand Go for LOI-2 on the next rev.
How do you read, Houston?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Reading you loud and clear. How me?
Loud and clear.
Roger. Frank, did you get my message on the DSE?
Roger. Roger.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Verify the Telemetry Input switch, Low. Over.
Roger. Understand; Telemetry Input, Low.
Affirmative.
Going to Low; it was in High.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. 5 minutes to LOS. Over.
Thank you, Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. One minute to LOS; all systems Go. Over.
Apollo 8. Roger. [Long pause.]
So long.
Adios. See you.
