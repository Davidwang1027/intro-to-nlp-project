Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, we'd like to have you, before you get in a P52 going here, we'd like to have you re-zero the optics and read us the mechanical CDUs. We're trying to collect a little data for troubleshooting.
Roger. Stand by.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
What's the trouble you're trying to troubleshoot?
This goes back to some of the problems we had prior to LOI; trying to see if the software readouts we're getting down here compare with the mechanical readouts. It's not a current problem as far as we know.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Why don't you just read me the mechanical CDUs there now, and then it looks from the ground like you're clear to go ahead with the P52.
Okay. We'll get the navigator squared away here in just a minute.
Good morning, Captain.
Good morning, sir.
This'll be a P52 out of a deep sleep. Okay, stand by one. [Long pause.]
The trunnion mechanical CDU looks like it's reading about one one-hundredth.
Roger. [Long pause.]
And the shaft mechanical C - OCDU looks like it's reading about four hundredth below zero, which would be about, what, 364. Yeah.
Understand, Jim. That's four hundredth below zero on the shaft; is that affirm?
Yes. Stand by one. [Pause.] About 35996 I get.
Okay. Thank you. And you can go ahead with P52 now.
Okay.
I always said he did better in his sleep. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. It looks like we're getting down on the Service Module RCS to the place where we ought to go ahead and activate the secondary Service Module RCS propellant.
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We've got a new PTC attitude. For the pitch, 180; and the yaw, 315.
Roger. Yaw, 315.
Roger. And pitch, 180.
Okay.
Could you pick one a little further away?
Not in our normal sphere. [Long pause.]
Ken, this is Jim.
Go ahead.
Aren't we still a little high on the quantity side to activate the secondary?
Negative. We have - let's see, we have quad Bravo and quad Delta which are getting right down, according to the calculated numbers, next to where we ought to be activating them. The numbers you're reading are going to be a little bit high, but the computer data on the ground shows that you have about 134 pounds in Bravo and Delta, and about 130 pounds is where you ought to be on the secondary.
Okay. Roger. We'll activate the secondary and turn off the primary.
Okay. It's just to keep you from running one of them out.
Rog.
Secondary activated.
Roger.
Hello Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Ken, on this maneuver, MCC-7, are you going to - are we going to burn the PAD data that we got sometime ago, or is there a new maneuver coming up, or what's going on in that regard? [Pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8. If required, we'll give you a new one. Right now, we are looking at not making a maneuver burn at all.
You're saying we may not even have that one now?
That's right. [Long pause.]
Okay. You're the boss.
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Could you try another omni? [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Try another omni, please. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. Read you loud and clear now. Just wanted to remind you that in the event of a loss of comm, we don't want you to burn MCC-7. Your present entry PAD is good. We'll be updating your landing point at the same time that you would have gotten MCC-7, and I'd like to have a crew status report from you when it's convenient. [Long pause.]
Okay, Ken. I understand now, if we would lose comm, you do not want us to burn MCC-7, just go ahead and use the entry PAD that you've given us?
That's affirmative. You'll be within 0.06 degrees of your entry angle target line.
All right. The crew status is, everybody has gotten real good rest last night, and everybody's in good shape. Jim is just waking up, Bill's starting the initial stowage, and we're - we all feel very well.
Okay. [Pause.]
Okay. And we'd like to - guess we need a PRD reading from you. And we'll be needing one in the neighborhood of 145-hour period, somewhere when it's convenient in there again.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, 8. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Could you give us our range - correction, our velocity and range from the Earth now?
Stand by.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. At time 51, your velocity will be 9,526, altitude 42,946. Over.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. You call? [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. Did you call?
Negative, this is Apollo 8. We did not call you.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. I've got some weather and recovery force status and a couple of last minute items to run down any time it's convenient for you.
All right. It's convenient right now.
Okay. For the mid-Pacific, the general condition is good. You can expect cloud bases 2,000 foot scattered, visibility 10 miles, wind 070 at 12, wave heights 4 feet, altimeter 2974. [Long pause.]
Okay, sunrise will be 17:10 Zulu, and first light, 16:49 Zulu. Recovery forces: ship will be Yorktown; the aircraft will be Airboss number 1 and 2, and Recoveries 1, 2, and 3. [Pause.] The estimated time to a target point: the ship is - Yorktown is on the target point; Airboss aircraft, 15 minutes and will be on-scene commander. Recoveries 1, 2, and 3 are SH3 Alphas, and they go with the Yorktown, so they're at the target point. All of them have swimmers aboard. If the recovery aircraft do not hear from the spacecraft, they'll go ahead and put swimmers in the water, and if you're in good shape and give them a call, they may hold off on dropping swimmers until sunrise.
Roger. Say again the sunrise and first light time for me, would you, please?
Say again, 8. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Notice the rather large middle gimbal angle. Over.
Thank you. [Pause.]
Would you say again the daylight time, please; sunrise, and first light.
Okay. Sunrise is 17:10 Zulu, and the first light is 16:49 Zulu. [Pause.]
Thank you.
Okay, 8. Looking over the weather I gave you was the 2,000 foot scattered at the target point. May have a 6,000 foot broken layer above that. At the max lift point, you have about the same thing, and altimeter's the same down the range. As you go further to the east, the weather should improve slightly; there's no problem with thunderstorms or rain showers in any of your recovery area.
Very good; thank you. [Pause.]
The items that we still need will be a PRD reading as late as you can do it conveniently prior to a final stowage. And we don't have any numbers on the last crew sleep period. I'd like to verify that the secondary RCS was activated on all four quads. And I have about five comments on the entry checklist procedures to verify.
It was activated on all four quads; that's correct. Our final stowage is completed. We'll read out the PR - we'll read out the PRDs for you now.
All right. Thank you.
The LMP's reads 0.64; I believe it's been that way throughout the flight. [Pause.] CMP's reads 0.11, that's 1.11.
Roger.
Stand by a minute while we look at it closely. That's 0.11.
Roger. 0.11.
And the one I ended up with reads 3.10.
Okay. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Okay. Go ahead, Ken. What else do you want to talk about?
Okay. To make everybody happy, we can use an estimate of the number of hours sleep that people got.
Oh. Okay, sorry.
Just a minute, I'll give you that; I forgot.
Thank you.
Bill Anders got about 5 hours, [pause] and Jim Lovell got about five, and I got about five and a half or six.
Sounds good.
Right.
Okay. We went through an exercise with the mockup on the pre-entry preparations, and we noticed that in the LMP's checklist on page S-12, when you go to top off the repress bottles, I believe it's a misprint; it should read the PLSS fill valve rather than the Repress valve, and we should be going to the fill position as opposed to going to On.
Roger. That's what we do.
Okay. And on - go ahead. [Pause.]
Go ahead. We agree that's what we do.
Okay. On page E-7 of the entry checklist and under step 34, as long as you have panel 382 open, that's a convenient time to go ahead and have the evaporator water controls, both primary and secondary, to Auto, and the suit heat exchanger for the secondary glycol to Flow.
Those items are already accomplished.
Very good. On page E-9, when you're getting ready to transfer the RCS to the Command Module position, if you want to avoid having the engines fire as a result of attitude correction, you might want to take the manual attitude switches to Accel Command or Minimum Impulse. And again on E-9 Alpha at step 41 Bravo, if you want to go back to attitude hold, bring the manual attitude switches back to Rate. [Pause.]
What was that last step?
Step 41 Bravo on page E-9 Alpha. It's if you decide to use either Minimum Impulse or Accel Command on page E-9, step 41 Bravo would be a good place to go back to Rate Command.
Okay. We do - that's where we do it.
Okay, fine. And...
I don't...
I didn't put all those control configurations changes in the checklist, but that's exactly what we do, use Minimum Impulse.
Okay. Real fine.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, 8. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. Go ahead.
I'd like to confirm one item on the PAD message, please.
Roger.
Time to retro the drogues, reference your last time to drogues, please.
Okay. I'll check that one out.
And also, Ken, we're going to turn on our VHF now, about 4 hours before entry.
Real fine. Thank you. I'll let you know when we pick it up.
A Simplex.
Affirm. [Pause.]
Ah, we're listening on VHF now too, Ken.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We have checked into your drogue time, and the number of 08:16 on your entry PAD is correct. We'll be giving you an updated entry PAD on the scheduled time of 143:30. At the same time, we'll be giving you an update of your state vectors for the LM and CSM.
Okay.
The midcourse correction number 7 was less than seven-tenths foot per second, and we will not execute it.
Very good.
You have a - You have a P52 scheduled at 143:30 which is not required. Your option. However, if you decide to delete the P52, the CMC self-check and DSKY condition light test are still requirements. Over.
What - what do you mean, they're still requirements? We weren't planning to do the CMC self-test. [Long pause.]
On that DSKY check, for goodness sake, that's...
Apollo 8, Houston. That's my mistake on the CMC self-check and DSKY condition light. That's an optional test. Over.
That's what we thought, Ken. Gosh, that's been working perfectly for 6 days, I don't - I don't see any reason to test it.
I agree.
Thank you. [Pause.]
Morning, Ken. How's Houston this morning?
Just fine. Nice and balmy.
Good.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, Apollo 8. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, go ahead.
I'm just - It's my understanding we're going to bring up the secondary loop at 1 hour prior to Sep, is that right?
That's affirmative, about page Echo-9. [Pause.]
Okay. [Pause.]
And Bill, Rod suggested that if we have the water boiler going on the primary loop, that you - you might wait about 5 minutes or so before you initiate the secondary loop. [Pause.]
Wait 5 minutes from what? From the time the primary loop starts or from 1 hour?
From the time the primary loop starts; this'll give you a check to see if it had a chance to dry out or not. [Long pause.]
I'm with you. Okay.
And for your own information, we already have a VHF downlink. It's poor quality, but we do have contact.
Okay. We haven't turned anything over to VHF yet.
Okay.
We tried to call you on the VHF though, Ken.
Rog. I say, the quality's pretty poor; they may not be able to understand you.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, Apollo 8. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Ken, we got two things going here which make this suit heat exchanger flow a little different. One of them is we're not doing a cold-soak, and the other one is we're powering down the secondary loop prior to Sep. And I wonder if it's a good idea to have the suit heat exchanger only on a secondary loop in that case. And plus the fact that we haven't got any cabin heat exchanger.
I don't think that was the intent, Bill. What they had in mind, we'd have both loops - have the suit heat exchanger on both loops; and if they got too cold, you could use the panel switching to shut down the primary loop through the heat exchanger. But in any event, you'd always have something going to the suit heat exchanger. I recognize that we are going to be shutting down the secondary heat exchanger pre-Sep and then turning it back on prior to entry, but the idea was to have both primary and secondary loops on the suit heat exchanger simultaneously.
Yeah, my checklist doesn't reflect that, but I think that's a good idea since we're a little suspect of our cabin fans and don't plan to use them.
Rog.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, 8. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. Go ahead.
Roger. What's Rod's estimate of our post-separation main bus voltage?
Apollo 8, Houston. We're making a handover from Carnarvon to Honeysuckle at 15.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, go ahead.
I'm still a little bit confused on this - activate the secondary loop. You indicated in - activating it at 1 hour or 5 minutes after the primary evaporator comes on the line. My checklist shows that the primary evaporator probably won't come on the line until we bypass the radiators. Have you got something else in mind that I don't know about? [Pause.]
Okay, Bill. We passed up an update some time back on page E-9, step 38, right at the beginning; and you've got a final GDC drift check. And then between there and the - and the step 39 where it says to terminate CM RCS preheat, that was the place we wanted to activate the primary loop by putting the glycol evaporator water switch to Auto and the glycol evaporator steam pressure to Auto. [Long pause.]
Roger. I don't expect it to boil, though. Do you?
Okay, Bill. We're hoping that it will there. It looks like we'll have had a stable attitude for some time, and we anticipate that it will be warm enough to make it boil. That is the reason it's suggested if it is boiling, that you wait. If it isn't, go ahead and turn on the secondary loop.
Okay. Well, that's where I was confused. I'm waking up. Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Apollo 8. We'd like to update your LM state vector, CSM state vector, and target point. And if it's convenient now, why, we'll go ahead and do that if you'll go to P00 and Accept. [Pause.]
Roger. P00 and Accept.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. The loads are in and verified, and the computer is yours.
Thank you.
You can take it back to Block, and for Bill's information, latest guess on the main bus post-Sep voltage to 27.5 [volts].
Guess?! [Pause.] You mean the EECOMs are guessing? [Pause.]
At least, they're honest for a change.
That's more than you can say for the computers.
Or the crew.
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay, 8. We have an entry PAD for you.
Good! Just a minute. [Long pause.]
Ready to copy, Houston.
Okay. This will be the mid-Pacific; 357, 152, 359; 146:29:00; 268, plus 08.13, minus 165.03; 06.5, 36221, 6.45, 1212.2, 36301, 146:46:14, 00:28. The next block is November Alpha: DO 4.00, 02:12; 00:25, 03:34, 08:14; 16, 059.0, 31.2; Zeta Persei, up 16.5, right 3.4; up. Use non-exit EMS pattern, GDC Align; primary star Sirius, secondary Rigel; roll, 308; pitch, 209; yaw, 357. This entry will not involve P65. Over. [Pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. Entry PAD as follows: mid-Pacific; 357, 152, 359; 146:29:00; 268, plus 08.13, minus 165.03; 06.5; 36221, 6.45, 1212.2, 36301, 146:46:14, 00:28, next block not applicable, 4.00, 02:12; 00:25, 03:34, 08:14; 16, 059, 31.2; Zeta Persei, up 16.5, right 3.5, up. Use non-exit EMS pattern, backup alignment; Sirius, Rigel; roll, 308; pitch, 209; yaw, 357; and we won't see P65.
Okay, Apollo 8. I'd like to verify sextant star shaft 0590, and the boresight star.
Roger.
The last one is right 3.4. Over.
Roger. Boresight star is right 3.4. And I have the sextant shaft; that's 059.0.
That's correct, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Apollo 8. Can you tell us if you've done anything with your potable water? We've noticed our readout has gone from 100 percent down to 56 in the last couple of minutes. [Pause.]
We're reading about 50 percent right now.
Roger. That correlates with what we see. Have you done anything to change configuration? Over. [Long pause.]
Yeah, we noticed we're venting here, too, Houston. [Long pause.]
Jim, did you mean you could visually see it?
Yeah, we're - we're - oh, stand by, Ken. Bill just dumped urine, so that might have been urine we were seeing. [Long pause.]
Bill just shut the potable inlet, Ken.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, 8. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, go ahead.
Roger, Houston. We're still showing about 52 percent here, and we had our switch on waste so we don't know whether it dropped from a higher value or not. Has yours been stabilized now?
That's affirmative; ours has stabilized now. And it was reading full just a few minutes ago.
Roger. I don't think - we can't account for any sudden drop in water.
Okay. We looked in the malfunction procedures, in number 28. And [it] doesn't reveal anything very startling.
Bill's looking there now.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, 8.
Okay. I'm looking at malfunction 28, and it takes you to box 6, but I don't really think that's the problem because the waste tank quantity hadn't changed any. Over.
Okay. I concur. We're watching the same thing.
Look, we don't care about the potable tank, but we do about the waste tank, so I'm just gonna - just in case there is a problem somewhere, I'm going to shut the potable tank off and leave the waste tank inlet valve open. How's that sound to you?
Stand by. [Pause.] Okay, 8. We concur.
If I see any water floating around, I'll give you another call.
Alright. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. Radio check.
Read you loud and clear.
Roger. We had a momentary loss of comm on the ground then. Read you loud and clear.
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Houston, Apollo 8. Did you call?
Apollo 8, Houston. You're loud and clear. We've taken a look at this water...
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. Read you loud and clear. We've taken a look at your potable water quantity problem, and it appears to be a transducer problem. Suggest that you leave the potable tank isolated. You have sufficient water in the waste tank to continue the entry. Over.
Roger. Thank you, Houston. [Pause.]
Does that mean we're Go for entry? [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, go ahead.
Roger. Is our thermal stability good enough we can leave the PTC attitude and go to entry gimbal angles now?
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Read you loud and clear, Apollo 8, and we're checking on the PTC problem now. [Pause.]
Apollo 8: Houston. You're cleared with entry attitude at this time.
Okay. Fine. Thank you.
Houston voice. Go to voice 425.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, loud and clear. Go. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. Go ahead.
Roger. We've completed the checklist down to the 1-hour point, and we'll stand by for 1 hour.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Just for information, did you folks end up having to use any Command Module RCS heaters?
Negative. All our indicators are pegged either high or at 5 volts.
Okay. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Carnarvon, Network. GOSS conference voice check. How do you read?
Network, Carnarvon. Read you weak but clear.
Roger, Carnarvon. I read you loud and clear.
You're loud and clear now. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Stand by for hand over to Carnarvon.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Apollo 8. If you'll go to P00 and Accept, we'd like to update your LM and CSM state vectors. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. State vector load is complete. Verify the computer is yours. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. State vector load is complete; the computer is yours. [Pause.]
Roger, Houston. We're going to Block.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Two fast items: number one, it's been suggested that since Marezine takes some time to take effect, you might consider whether you'd be interested in taking some now. And I have an entry PAD which has some very small updates to go on it if you would like to copy that.
Okay. Stand by, and we'll get out the entry PAD. [Long pause.]
Okay. Go ahead with the entry PAD, Houston.
Okay. We're still going to the mid-Pacific; 357, 152, 359; 146:29:13, 267; plus 08.13, minus 165.03; 06.6; 36221, 6.47; 1216.6, 36301; 146:46:13; 00:28; the next block is November Alpha; D0 4.00, 02:10; 00:25, 03:35, 08:16; 16, 059.0, 31.2; Zeta Persei, up 16.5, right 34; up. Non-exit EMS pattern; Sirius and Rigel: roll, 308; pitch, 209; yaw, 357. No P65 involved. Over. [Long pause.]

That's correct, Apollo 8. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. You're clear to initiate cabin cold-soak at your discretion. Over.
Roger, Houston. We're starting that now.
[Garble] your mike is stuck.
You've a hot mike, Houston.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, 8.
Okay. It doesn't appear that we are going to be able to trigger the primary evaps, so I'm going to go ahead and start up the secondary loop. [Pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8. We concur.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, 8. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, go ahead.
Roger. Since we're going as smoothly as we are here, we've got good comm, let's start this pyro circuit check about 10 minutes early. What do you say? [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. We can conduct the pyro check at any time.
Alright. Why don't we do it here just momentarily then?
Roger.
We'll give you a call when we're ready.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Houston, we're ready to proceed with the pyro circuit check.
Roger. Go ahead.
MSFN, are you monitoring the sequential test now? [Pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. That's affirmative. [Long pause.]
Hello, Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. Loud and clear. Affirmative we are monitoring.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Standing by for Go for Pyro Arm.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. You have a Go.
Roger.
Houston, this is Apollo 8; How's your tracking looking?
Looking great.
Okay. Everything went fine with the check. We're all armed and ready to go here.
Okay. If you're not doing anything else, how about let's make a VHF check.
Okay. I'll turn off my S-band; the other two will stay on S-band.
Roger. I'll give you a count in just a second. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Simultaneous VHF and S-band. Over.
Rog. I'm not reading you on VHF.
Rog. Stand by one. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Simultaneous VHF and S-band. Do you verify that you are on the left hand VHF antenna? Over. [Pause.]
We can verify the antenna, but we can't verify reading you on S-band or on VHF.
Okay. We're receiving some downlink, although it's considered to be poor quality.
Apollo 8, Houston. We'd like to try the right VHF antenna, if you have time. [Pause.]
We're on ri - we're on right, Ken.
Okay. This is a simultaneous VHF and S-band transmission: one, two, three, four, five. How do you read on VHF? Over.
Read you loud and clear.
Understand that's on VHF. Is that affirm? [Long pause.]
Houston, this is Apollo 8. I answered your call on VHF. Did you receive?
Okay. It's not piped back here. MOCR'll have to check and see if they have it on the ground station.
You were loud and clear, Ken.
Rog. Thank you. [Pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8. We received you loud and clear on VHF through Carnarvon. [Pause.]
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Stand by for handover from Carnarvon to Guam on the hour. We should have continuous contact except for the blackout period beginning at 146:51.
Roger.
