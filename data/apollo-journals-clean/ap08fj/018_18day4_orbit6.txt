What time is it there? About 2 o'clock?
Are you finished with the computer?
Yes, go ahead.
How are the systems, Bill?
Well, the last time I looked at them, they were pretty good, chief.
All the gauges are looking at each other.
If you want to say anything about your tracking pass this time, I - Just let me know and we can go into high bit rate.
Okay.
Okay, how about keeping your eye on these camera settings, too, on the next couple of passes?
You wanted to be 10 degrees, didn't you?
Yes.
Well, overshot, then.
Okay, the first one is 1/500th of a second.
Okay.
All those scientists are saying now, "Ohhh, if we only had a geologist onboard.
Okay, he couldn't see anything. I took that monocular and tried to eyeball it out the window last time.
Yes?
Nothing but a big blur out there. He'd see enough to make it interesting, but not enough to do anything.
Okay, I'm going to go out of here.
4 minutes.
Okay. when's your first PCA - TCA?
79:10.
Huh?
79:10.
79:10?
Yes, sunrise, it says here.
I can't hear you.
Sunrise is 79:08.
Yes.
We're 3 minutes away; that's 9 degrees.
Oh. boy. I may see the Sun; I'd better be careful too. Hey, there is - there's a - Here's a glow, you can see the Sun come around a little bit.
Is that right?
Yes, I can see the Sun come up before it comes up.
Like zodiacal light, a little bit, maybe.
Rim brightening, they call it? (Probably means Limb brightening)
Yes.
Yes, you sure can.
Oh boy!
Can you describe it?
Yes, it's a real bright glow right in one spot, and it fans out all over the horizon. And I'm just trying to move my eye away, because the Sun's going to peek over here any second now, and it's getting brighter and brighter, and it's get - It's an even light.
Bright spot fans out over horizon?
Yes, yes, then it fans up into the air; it's an even light; then all of sudden, it - The Sun is peeking out right now.
Whooo!
See it?
Geez, I got a start there. I saw that - some stuff come out of the optics or something; I thought it was a star whirling by.
All right, now you want to roll to keep that trunnion...
We wouldn't want - I didn't realize you were that quick. Okay, which way?
Okay, roll - roll left.
Roll left, okay.
I'm yawing...
Watch her - watch her as she comes down.
I yawed a little left.
Okay.
How are we doing?
Okay.
Is it 10 degrees left?
Yes, right now. You got enough roll? What happened?
I went to Manual. I'll get it for you.
You all right? You got your camera on?
I'll put it on, just as soon as we get rid of the Sun.
[Garble] turn it down now.
Wait a minute, you - you want me to - you want me to try to avoid it?
Yes, you can pitch down a little bit.
Hey, wait a minute, are you - I'm roll - I may roll over 10 degrees.
That you that's driving it?
No, I'm not driving it now. Well, I'm driving it now, yes. That's enough. That's enough.
Let me go back there and try this CMC again.
Okay, let's try that one again.
Pitch down?
We're right smack on 10 degrees.
Okay.
You can pitch down a little more, if you want to.
Okay.
Okay, Auto Optics is doing the whole thing for me. Now - get this camera going.
Auto is fairly close.
Fantastic pictures here, Bill.
Give you a Manual Optics.
Oh my gosh!
What?
My Auto Optics has put it right on.
We going to make that angle, or not?
I'm just letting it run here for a little bit before I try to brake it.
It's getting kind of small.
That's - that's okay. Don't bother using up gas. Okay.
All right. I already bothered, I'm sorry.
I haven't loaded this camera, [garble].
Ahhhh!
What? What happened?
Oh, that's okay.
It's chilly in here...
Don't - don't wake up Frank.
Oh, okay. Okay.
Yes. Sorry, Frank, I didn't mean to disturb you. Thought I pushed the wrong button.
Okay, what's your attitude now?
Seems to - oh, about 6 degrees.
Above?
Yes.
Okay, just hold it right there.
Okay, we've got another one coming up. Same procedure.
This is - Now, where's that book?
I've got [garble] book's over there.
Should be coming up on Low right now.
Okay, we're tracking the new one.
(Garbled.)
Yes?
(Garbled.)
It's still going on, Frank.
Do we have the recorder on?
On LOW bit rate. Do you want to say something?
Yes, well.
You're quite welcome. Okay, why don't you stop it, and put it to high bit rate, and put it forward again?
Okay.
(Whistling) Okay.
Tape recorder is where - Record, Forward...
Just put it - put it to Stop
Which one is it, the center?
Yes.
No, no, no, no. Push this forward.
Forward?
Put it this way in the middle.
Yes.
...several comments on...
Good and loud; they'll never be able to hear you there.
Several comments on landmark tracking. The last time I used Auto Optics, putting in the coordinates, I found the first time in Manual Optics for CP-1, the G&N system did quite well. It tracked almost as good as I could track manually right on the target, and I tipped it over just at the last moment to take my five marks. There - appears to be very smooth tracking; no problem - with this particular system. I'm now in CP-2; I have it just below the horizon now, and it's tracking down from the horizon automatically.
Okay. Now, what do you want me to do?
The same deal in reverse.
Okay, I'll go to - Stop?
Yes.
Look at that! It is right on!
Are you using this map for anything, Jim?
Got the rate, Jim?
No, this is pretty good, though, I didn't - Maybe that could be the problem. Maybe I could [garble].
Oh, it's scheduled a little later in the day [garble].
What is that, Jim?
What was that? [Garble].
Oh, that?
You hear that noise over there?
Yes.
Okay.
How long does this hand controller stay armed?
Hey, Jim.
Yes.
This hand controller's armed.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over. [No answer.]
This should be [garble] or [garble]?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over. [No answer.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Try them again.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Houston, this is Apollo 8. Over.
Did you see our landing site, Frank?
Huh?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Roger. Reading you very weak but a lot of background noise. Welcome back around. How are you reading us?
Reading you fine.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger, Houston. A few words on our optics tracking system. I used auto optics for control points 1 and 2 on the backside, and they worked beautifully, tracked both targets for me. And I went to the control point 3, as designated in our orbital control book, to see the latitude and longitude that was given to me and used auto optics to track that particular coordinate with it, and it was very close to the actual tracking plot. I picked the mark there where I did a final marking and recorded latitude and longitude. I'm now about to come up on the landing site and using auto optics, using the coded input to see how that works. [Long pause.]
Roger, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8. Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We know you're busy so we're not going to bother you. We're watching your progress on the DSKY. You're looking good; all your systems are looking good and we have maneuver PADs for you any time at your convenience.
Roger. We'll take them when we're doing the P52, if that's okay.
That's just fine.
Yes.
Well, you can almost [garble].
I'll do one thing until I get up there, but [garble].
You want to take a look at this? [Garble] it's something - I don't know what.
Just wonderful [garble] right on [garble].
Mike, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, go ahead.
Roger. I drew up in Auto Optics now on the landing site. It would just warm up old Jack Schmitt's heart. The auto optics is tracking perfectly on the - on the target, and the two IPs turned out beautifully. I have a beautiful view of it. The first IP's just barely beneath the vertical now, and the second one's coming up. It's just a grand view.
Glad to hear it, Jim. Jack's listening. [Long pause.]
For Jack's information, the Sun angles that we see now from the first IP, second IP, and the B-1 are just right, I think, for landing conditions. The shadows aren't too deep for you to get confused, but the land is - has texture to it, and there are enough shadows to make everything stand out. [Pause.]
If Jack's listening, tell him that the optics may be doing all right, but the eyeballs are having a little trouble looking through all this smear on the windows.
Roger. Understand the optics are doing better than the eyeballs. How about the cameras?
The cameras have the same smear to look through. The rendezvous windows are okay, but they're so small and looking in the wrong directions here so far.
Roger.
I think the vertical stereo will be okay.
It certainly looks like we're picking the more interesting parts of the Moon to land in. The back side looks like a sand pile my kids have been playing in for a long time. It's all beat up, no definition. Just a lot of bumps and holes. [Pause.]
I'm looking 2P-2 right now, Houston, and it's a great spot.
The area that we're over right now gives some hint of possible volcanics, though I really can't eyeball it at the moment to pin that down. There are some craters and build-ups that just definitely suggest volcanic activity.
Rog. Understand, Bill, and understand Jim thinks the ole 2P-2 is a winner. [Pause.]
Yeah, that backside doesn't look too interesting.
Roger.
That's relatively speaking, of course.
Of course.
Frank, we're just finishing up the [garble] here. [Garble].
We've got to copy this [garble], too.
[Garble] Frank, the SPS is about [garble] hours [garble].
Okay.
Okay.
We got about 4 hours [garble]. It's about 4½ hours.
You know, [garble] the trash bag, we ought to get out that [garble] and look it over.
Same set.
Do you need that any more, Bill?
Lan - landing site, landing site. Yes.
Do you need that any more, Bill?
Do I need what? No, I don't need any more.
You might as well sleep, or one of us might as well, because it doesn't - doesn't take two guys to do it, and you can't see anything else anyway. The other guy's just sitting around scratching his rear.
Have they sent us updates, yet?
No.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Roger, Jim.
Go ahead, Houston.
We have you on the High Gain Antenna. We'd like you to take the DSE and dump it. Over.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Get all - the figures?
Roger.
Okay.
It's up to him.
Have we lost contact with them?
Houston. Are you going to use our computer to update our state vector?
That's affirmative, Jim. We'd - we'd like to - stand by one, and I'll tell you when to go to P00 and Accept.
Roger. Then I'll work my 52 around your [garble]. [Long pause.]
Jim, would you please go to P00 and Accept, and we'll send you a P27, LM state vector update.
Roger. You have P00...
Thank you.
...and Accept.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is Apollo 8. We have a little piece of useful information if you're interested in deliberating over it.
Go ahead. Say again?
Roger. Our first control point is very near the terminator, and as the optics were tracking it, I had occasion to watch the Sun come up. And at about 2 minutes before sunrise, you get - the limb begins to brighten up into sort of a fine white haze, a faint glow completely over the space just behind the limb. [Pause.]
Rog. Understand. About 2 minutes before the Sun comes up, you get a fine white haze radiating out from behind the limb. How far out does it extend?
It goes up quite a ways. It takes a fan shape, unlike the sunrise on Earth where the atmosphere affects it. This just sort of is a complete haze all over the local area. It's concentrated at the exact spot the sun comes up at ignition and then goes away from the sun spots. Very interesting.
Roger, Jim. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We're standing by with your map and TEI-7 updates. [Pause.]
Stand by. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. You can go back to Block at your computer.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, Mike. We're ready for the map update and - and then the TEI.
Okay. When you got your - before you get your map book out, the Houston Comm Techs have got a little word for an old ex-CapCom. They say they consider you go on Remote. Over. [Pause.]
Not permanently, I hope.
Okay. Your map update for rev 6/7: LOS, 80:57:24; sunrise, 81:06:57; prime meridian, 81:13:02. Are you with me?
You cut out after the prime meridian. I got it, but not AOS
AOS, 81:43:05; sunset, 82:19:54; remarks: IP-1, TCA for B-1, 82:07:39; and now I've got four more times for you which are acquisition times for when various things come over the horizon. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. Control point 1, acquisition time, 81:09:05; control point 2, acquisition time, 81:21:48; control point 3, acquisition time, 81:43:17; B-1 acquisition time, 82:03:54. And I say again, all those ACQ times are when they first come over the horizon. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. Copy, Houston. And in about 2 seconds, I'll be ready for the TEI.
All right. [Long pause.]
I am ready.
TEI-7; SPS/G&N - stand by one, Bill. [Long pause.]
Just a matter of general interest, Houston: everybody is feeling good, and the CDR is taking a snooze.
Roger. Glad to hear it. We're just talking about a water dump down here. We've got one coming up, and it looks like on this rev prior to the time around LOS or just prior to LOS, would be a convenient time to do it. Do you concur?
Okay. We will. Down to 25 percent again?
That's affirmative, and we'd also be interested in any comments about what these various dumps have done to your optics, if anything, and how long the effects last after a dump.
Don't seem to have done anything to the optics, but they've definitely got in some of the windows. There are a few little chunks of ice on window number 1, which is nearest the vent, and also on window number 5 a little bit; windows 2 and 4 remain amazingly clear. [Pause.]
Roger. Thank you, Bill, and I'm ready to resume the PAD when you are.
Okay. Press on with the weight.
All right. Weight, 45701; minus 0.40, plus 1.57; 083:18:20.80; plus 3234.6, minus 0116.8, plus 0573.0. Are you with me so far? Over. [Long pause.]
I think there's pieces of a [garble].
I think I'll just hold onto this thing [garble].
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Mike.
Rog. I got down through Delta-V, X, Y, and Z. Did you copy these? Over.
No I didn't read a word. I'm still waiting for the weight.
Roger. Let's go back to the weight: 45701; minus 0.40, plus 1.57. Are you with me? Over.
Sounds good.
Okay. GETI, 083:18:20.80; plus 3234.6, minus 0116.8, plus 4 - correction - plus 0573.0. Are you with me? Over.
Roger.
Thank you. 179, 009, 001; not applicable, plus 0018.7; 3287.0, 3:07, 3267.6; 42, 088.0, 25.3; 033, down 12.1, left 2.7; plus 07.90, minus 165.00; 1297.3, 36238, 146:44:14; same north set, Sirius and Rigel, roll 129, pitch 155, yaw 010; 4 quads for 15 seconds; horizon on the 2-degree mark at Tignition. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. TEI-7; SPS/G&N; 45701; minus 0.40, plus 1.57; 083:18:20.80; plus 3234.6, minus 0116.8, plus 0573.0; 179, 9 - correction - 009, 001; N/A. Are you with me?
Yeah, I'm with you, Bill.
Plus 0018.7; 3287.0, 3:07, 3267.6; 32 - correction - 42, 088.0, 25.3; 033, down 12.1, left 2.7; plus 07.90, minus 165.00; 1297.3, 36238, 146:44:14; same north set, Sirius, Rigel, 129, 155, 010; 4 jet, 15 seconds, 2 degrees on the horizon at TIG.
That's all correct.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. You got your DSE back, and you are Go for the next lunar orbit. Over.
Roger. How far did you want us to dump that water?
25 percent, please, Bill. [Pause.]
Roger. 25 percent.
We ought to get that thing set up right now.
Okay.
Because I can be - we can be tracking while we're dumping, too.
Houston, Apollo 8. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Are you receiving our - our tracking data? [Pause.]
That's affirmative, Jim. We are receiving.
Okay. Thank you.
And also, Jim, we - That last P27 we sent you was for the LM state vector only, and it will require a Verb 47 Enter to transfer to the CSM slot. Over.
Roger. Will do.
Thank you.
Are you getting out, Frank? You getting out?
Wait a minute; pitch up. You [garble] you pitch down [garble].
Well, let me see now. That's the right connection; I think so. We got - Where is the filter, Bill?
I think they made a mistake here in the Flight Plan.
Oh, you have it on here, huh?
Do you have the water - This - Urine Heater's been On, right?
If you pitch down, yes...
Okay, we have the hose connected, so we want to go through the procedure.
Okay, Waste Stowage Vent, Vent for 5 seconds.
You want to be...
(Garbled.)
I'll show you; just a minute.
Yes, they're Opened and Closed [garble] here. I'm in 4-A? Okay, if it's reading 1, I could put Waste - Waste Tank's Vent for 5 seconds, huh?
Right, Waste Stowage, Vent, yes, for 5 seconds.
Done.
Battery, Vent.
4-A?
Yes. Take her down?
Take the Battery, Vent, down. It's not down; let it come down.
Well, it's getting real close to it.
Oh, there it goes. Okay, it's down.
It's down?
Okay, close them both.
Make sure your Urine Heater's On.
Urine Heat's on A.
Okay. And - go ahead and dump the waste.
Okay, we take that over and put it an - where it says, "Open/Close, Waste Tank Servicing.
Yes.
Put that to Open. Leave it go in there.
Okay, now we got to watch the waste tank.
Yes, I'm watching it.
You're watching it? Okay. You got Waste Tank, On, then?
Yes.
Okay.
I don't know, Frank.
It's still pretty good. Let's see here [garble].
Okay. We're dumping the waste tank now, Houston.
Roger, Bill.
You want to get up here now?
Okay, just about even.
You want to get up on one of these seats? You want to get up here?
This is okay over here. Clear.
It'd be a good time to do it, because there's more - Jim's really the only one that's busy, and I can fix his.
Yes.
Yes, it - it'll take a good while.
It's up at 85 percent. Right now, it's 47.
Now much film do we have left over, Bill?
Well, I'll tell you, Jim, these windows are so bad, you can just take pictures - say one - We need - we need - Don't get into that interior - interior's for inside stuff; and we need one - 16 millimeter for the convergent stereo, and - oh, about a half of one for that image-motion compensation which - kind of a low-priority thing.
Do you do you want Verb 83? Did you look for...
Yes, it's the [garble] isn't all that bad, but we could try - we are allowed to yaw. We could try Verb 83 for drill.
Okay, I'd better get out the books and...
This one says 92; I'll crank it around a little bit.
Okay, how's our RCS doing?
Good.
Let's see if...
Well, it hasn't changed since we started. See, it's still about - 67 percent.
SPS is holding steady.
Did you cycle through the EPS, Jim? [Garble]...
No, I haven't done that, yet. Okay, and don't forget...
(Garbled.)
Yes, well...
Okay, EPS. You're on BAT B charge, you know?
Yes, just leave that there, don't change that.
Okay, it's 39 [garble] now.
Okay, I can cycle this one okay, right?
Slip those around those cameras, Jim, and I'll fix them while you're shooting that landing site.
Okay, we got - let's see, we got 23 minutes until sunrise, so we've got a lot of time.
I haven't seen that water going down any at all.
(Garbled.)
Well, [garble] steam pressure's...
It's not going down any.
Bill.
Not going down.
What?
Not going down.
Ask Houston if it's...
Okay. you want to - Let's see here. Put the purge line - Take that wat - Shut the wa - Well, that off - put the water on, and - put that purge fitting on it.
(Garbled.)
Oh!
(Garbled.)
That's one thing you forgot to tell us!
(Laughter.)
Here it goes.
Yes, I can see it; it's dumping.
And we solved another mystery!
We have three problems and one's F. Borman.
(Garbled.)
Yes, it's going down.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We've got four minutes 'til LOS, and everything's looking good down here.
Roger.
How much longer do you think we have to go into battery charge there, Mike?
I'll find out for you. [Pause.]
If you can wake up the EECOM, why don't you have him ask the back room?
Oh, you really know how to hurt a guy. [Pause.]
(Laughter)
Yes, it is. Yes.
Apollo 8, Houston. We estimate charge will be complete in another 45 minutes. Over.
Okay. Thank you very much.
[Garble.]
Huh?
[Garble] water?
60 - 70 - 75 percent, 75 percent.
Yes.
(Singing.)
Well, did you guys ever think that one Christmas you'd be orbiting the Moon?
I say, one Christmas Eve you'd be orbiting the Moon?
Just hope we're not doing it on New Year's.
Hey, hey, don't talk like that, Bill; think positive.
[Garble.]
I said, just hope we don't do it on New Year's.
Apollo 8, Houston. One minute to LOS, and standing by.
Okay. See you on the other side, Mike.
Looking forward to it. [Pause.]
Me too.
That was pretty spectacular: never to see the Moon until just before braking into - into LOI.
That's kind of a nonchalant approach, you know that (laughter)? Remember Warren North's procedure of eyeball the Moon, and whatever we had to do to...
Yes, [garble].
