Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Hey, Jerry, how much water does this - the water dispenser in the Lower Equipment Bay, the one that puts out hot and cold water - how much comes out of that with each shot?
Stand by. I'll take a check on that. And, by the way, welcome to the Moon's sphere.
The Moon's fair?
The Moon's sphere - you're in the influence.
That's better than being under the influence. [Long pause.]
Hey, Jerry?
Go ahead, 8.
My handy LMP had his schematics out at the drop of a hat and informs me that it's one ounce per cycle. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, looks like the flying EECOM and the ground EECOM [Charles Dumis] came to a dead heat on that one.
They did?
Rog. We got the same answer at the same time. [Pause.]
I'll have Bill put it - I'll have Bill put it on the tape recorder and send it down to you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay, 8. We want to run a little exercise on the ground here to ensure that we're able to dump the tape and bring the voice portion back to Houston in a timely manner. So we plan to dump your tape, and we're going to exercise the procedures on the ground to get it back here and take a listen to it. We believe that we have something on the tape already unless you have recorded over it after the last dump. Just to make sure, we'd like to have you just say a few words, give us a short count or something on the tape and anything else that you might want to put on there. And we're going to do this in the next 5 minutes before we get away from Madrid. That's the site we want to exercise, so we'll go ahead and do that, and we'll tell you before we make the dump. [Pause.]
Roger.
...hazy, so we haven't really taken too many pictures on the way out. Every now and then we have taken a shot with the 70-millimeter camera and 80-millimeter lens at f/11, 1/250th, but it's questionable how good these will be, because of the haze on the windows.
Another problem has been trying to record the development of the smear on the windows. Seemed to come pretty quick on window number 3. And the technique of - of taking a picture when the Sun is 85 degrees incidence is not possible, because the window frames are so thick that you can't get any Sun on them with an 85-degree incidence. What pictures have been taken, have been taken about 60 to 70 degrees incidence with various f-stops.
Anybody else have anything for the record?
No.
Jim?
Yeah, you might mention about this hard thing to open here.
One point we might mention is that the foodbox doors are hard to close. Looks like the foodbox has split out a little bit on the left....
The handle's bent.
...left side. And in - look's like we've gotten the handle bent in trying to close the door. We're able to lock it on one side now, on the right side, but not on the left. The food has generally been good, particularly the last meal: butterscotch pudding, beef stew, grapefruit drink, and chicken soup. Notable...
Hot wa...
...the notable, mainly notable ones were the grapefruit drink and the butterscotch pudding.
Well, Bill, you might mention the hot water makes a big improvement, too.
Jim Lovell says the hot water makes a big improvement. The meals I've had have been quite tasty though none of us have really gone overboard for the little bread cru - cubes and cereal cubes.
Also, I'd like to suggest that if they ever fly one of these TV cameras again, they put a - some kind of a sight on it. Sort of ridiculous to have a 9-degree field-of-view lens with no way of aiming it except for looking down the side or putting some chewing gum on the top.
Also might tell Doc Frome that his toothpaste tastes pretty good. I don't know what kind of job it does on your teeth, but it's nice for settling your stomach after dinner.
Anything else, Frank?
We used it for frosting on the fruitcake.
Jim Lovell is be - engaged in an activity which I shan't describe, so I think I'll cut this short and get my oxygen mask.
But that could be improved, also [laughter].
Houston, Houston, this is Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Okay. Ken, we put a few comments on the last of the tape after we heard from you, and it's being rewound now, and you can have it as soon as we get it back to the beginning.
Okay. We'll have to wait. It looks like you are going out of the attitude to use High Gain. We'll catch it next time around and then dump it.
Okay. I notice it's been in high bit rate, so it will probably take quite a while.
Alright.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Rog. Do you think you're in a position where we could use the High Gain?
Give it a try.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're dumping at this time.
Roger. Tape voice is probable. [Pause.]
We ought to also get a check on it at low bit rate for DSE voice, Ken.
Apollo 8, are you saying that everything that's on there now is in high bit (rate)?.
That's where my switch was.
Okay. We'll take a look at it then. If there wasn't anything that was previously recorded in low bit, why, we'll come back and maybe take a look at that, too.
Okay. We might get - wait 'til - wait until we get in a little closer to the Moon to put as big a strain on it as we can.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We've completed the dump, and the tape recorder's back to you. You can use it any way you want. We may want to dump that thing again, and if we do, why, we'll go ahead and use the same information unless you have something else that you specifically wanted to put on there later. Listening to the voice quality - it sounds real good. We're coming up on a midcourse [correction]-4 and right now it - talking about doing it on time, and you can anticipate the burn in the neighborhood of 3 foot per second [1 m/s]. We're considering, and would like for you to think about the possibility of doing this burn using the onboard vector and just have us update the vector in the LM slot, so that you'll have the MSFN [Manned Space Flight Network] vector on board. But it looks like it won't have any big effect on the burn results, and it might prove interesting. So if you think about that one for a bit and let us know if you have any suggestions or thoughts on the subject.
Roger. You're saying using the onboard vectors. Leave the MSFN vectors on the LM slot.
That's affirm, if that's what you'd like to do. We've considered it, and looks like it would be a reasonable thing.
Roger. Frank and Jim are asleep now, why don't we all bring this up to them when they wake up.
Okay. Real fine. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. How about stirring up the oxygen.
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Bill. I guess I want to belay my last about the - using the onboard state vector for MCC-4. After looking at it some more on the ground, they've got to get going on making their PADs and doing all their computations, and rather than put it off or do it twice, we're going to go ahead and go with the procedures we've been using all along.
Okay. With reference to the midcourse, I think that's generally agreed upon, that we do it like we've always been doing it. Now, with respect to the windows, center window's essentially usable. The two side windows are - may be alright for observation, and the problem with the rendezvous windows is they're pretty small. Kind of thought we'd just have to play the window game by ear almost. Not really sure what capability we're going to have but we'll give you some more thoughts on this later.
Okay. How about exercising the idea of rolling over and having Jim do his polarization through the telescope because if we have to change attitudes we'd like to go ahead and start thinking about what effects that'll have on such things as antenna orientation and all that.
Okay. We'll, I'll mention it to him when they wake up.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Apollo 8, we'd like to update your CMC clock. This is not to correct errors which we have now but just to make up for some effects that we're going to have in lunar orbit. And what we'd like to have you do is go to P00 and Accept and let us update the clock time.
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Okay. You got P00 and Accept.
Rog. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We're completed with the clock update, and the computer's yours.
Roger. [Pause.] Going to Block.
Rog.
Apollo 8, Houston. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Houston.
How about an O2 purge?
Okay.
Thank you.
There's number 1.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Houston. Apollo 8. Go ahead.
Okay. We'd like to update CMC. The order that we'll update will be the LM state vector, the CSM state vector, and the external Delta-V and the REFSMMAT. So any time you're free with it, we can have P00 and Accept; we'll go ahead with it. [Pause.]
Roger. Understand you're going to update LM state vector, CSM state vector, external Delta-V and the REFSMMAT.
That's affirmative. And I'll have one, two, three PAD's to read to you.
Stand by. Okay. You've got P00 and Accept.
Okay, thank you. And just a minute, I'll be with you on the PAD's. They'll be three minute maneuver PAD's, one of them MCC-4.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. We're ready to copy, if you read.
Okay. Stand by one, though.
Okay. I thought maybe we'd lost comm here for a second.
No, I'm just behind. [Long pause.]
Okay. Apollo 8, let me read you midcourse correction number 4. [Pause.]
Okay.
Alright. Midcourse correction number 4: the RCS/G&N; 62888; November Alpha, November Alpha; 060:59:54.30; minus 0001.2, minus 0001.1, plus 0001.2; 031, 008, 323; November Alpha, plus 0061.8; 0002.0, 0:11, 0002.0; 17, 296.5, 30.8; Alpha Centauri, up 07.3, left 3.4. [Pause.] For the stars, it will be the primary, Sirius; secondary, Rigel; 129, 155, 010. Over. [Long pause.]
Roger. MCC-4, RCS/G&N; 62888; N/A, N/A; 060:59:54.30; minus 0001.2, minus 0001.1, plus 0001.2; 031, 008, 323; N/A. Are you with me so far?
Keep going.
Plus 0061.8; 0002.0, 0:11, 0002.0; 17, 296.5, 30.8; Alpha Centauri, up 07.3, left 3.4; primary, Sirius; secondary, Rigel; 129, 155, 010. Over.
That's correct, Apollo 8. [Long pause.]
And what else have you got?
Okay. I've got one for pericynthion plus 2, and it's a minimum Delta-V solution. [Pause.]
Roger. Ready to copy.
Okay. This is pericynthion plus 2. RCS/G&N; 62871; November Alpha, and stand by one. Okay. We'll pick up with a pitch trim and yaw trim of Not Applicable; time, 071:07:22.16; minus 0046.8, plus 0025.4, plus 0018.1; 173, 101, 027; November Alpha, plus 0018.7; 0056.3, 5:15, 0056.3; 01, 316.9, 19.8; 044, down 04.4, left 4.5; plus 11.00, minus 025.00; 1296.7, 36198, 137:01:53; primary, Sirius; secondary, Rigel; 129, 155, 010; four jets plus-X. This assumes execution of midcourse correction number 4 and uses the same alignment as midcourse correction. Over.
Roger. Pericynthion plus 2, minimum Delta-V; RCS/G&N; 62871; N/A, N/A; 071:07:22.16; minus 0046.8, plus 0025.4, plus 00181; 173, 101, 027; NA, plus 0018.7; 0056.3, 5:15, 0056.3; 01, 316.9, 19.8; 044, down 04.4, left 4.5; plus 11.00, minus 025.00; 1296.7, 36198, 137:01:53; primary, Sirius; secondary, Rigel; 129, 155, 010; four jets plus-X; assumes MCC-4 with same alignment. Over.
That's correct, Apollo 8. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 8. Confirm that boresight star and SPA are exactly the same number and not typographical error. [Pause.]
Rog, Apollo 8. They're checking that. And Apollo 8, the computer is yours. You can take it back.
Roger. Going to Block.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 8, Houston. [Pause.]
Houston, this is Apollo 8. Do you copy?
I do now, loud and clear. I've got one more PAD for you, and the confirmation that those boresight star number and the pitch angle are correct at 44.
Roger. And we're ready to go do our P52 preferred alignment at this time. Are you ready?
That's affirmative. [Pause.]
Okay. We're ready to copy.
Okay. This is a pericynthion plus 2 for a fast return. This will be SPS/G&N; 62871; minus 1.61, plus 1.29; 071:06:42.07; plus 4522.4, minus 0621.6, minus 1871.2; 001, 287, 351; November Alpha, plus 0018.7; 4933.6, 6:03, 4911.8; 11, 203.8, 29.6; Earth, up 01.0, right 3.7; plus 14.75, plus 065.00; 1323.9, 36913, 106:09:23; primary star, Sirius; secondary, Rigel; 129, 155, 010; no ullage, assumes execution of midcourse correction 4 and uses the same alignment. The time for MCC-5 for GERU determination, that's Golf Echo Romeo Uniform, this will be a GET of 83:02; use P37 NC-4, steps 1 through 10 and NC-8, steps 3 and 4. I say again, use P37 November Charlie 4, steps 1 through 10, and November Charlie 8, steps 3 and 4. [Pause.] Velocity 400K for corridor control chart, 36507. Over. [Long pause.]
Houston, Roger. This is Apollo 8. You copy?
This is Houston. No joy. [Pause.]
Roger, Houston. This is Apollo. How you read?
Okay. Loud and clear, Bill.
Okay, Ken. Pericynthion plus 2, fast return; SPS/G&N; 62871; minus 1.61, plus 1.29; 071:06:42.07; plus 4522.4, minus 0621.6, minus 1871.2; 001, 287, 351; N/A, plus 0018.7; 4933.6, 6:03, 4911.8; 11, 203.8, 29.6; Earth, up 01.0, right 3.7; plus 14.75, plus 064.00; 1323.9, 36913, 106:09:23; primary, Sirius; secondary, Rigel; 129, 155, 010; no ullage, assumes MCC-4, same alignment, MCC-5 GERU determination GET 83:02, P37 NC-4, 1 through 10 and copy NC-8, 3 and 4. [Long pause.] Velocity at 400K, 36507. Over.
Okay, Apollo 8. That's correct with one exception: in the PAD format under longitude Noun 61, that is plus 06500. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. That's what I have, plus 06500.
Okay. That's correct, Apollo 8. [Long pause.]
And we're ready to copy whatever else you have. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, let's go back and confirm on your minimum Delta-V pericynthion plus 2 that the pitch column is 101; that's the fifth block down.
Roger. Pitch - Roger, pitch 101.
Okay. Thank you very much. And the item we have left to go is we'd like to get with you on how you want to handle the problem with windows on Rev 2. [Long pause.]
Okay: Houston. Stand by on that, please.
Roger.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. We want you to come up with a suggested redline for RCS usage during lunar orbit, also, please.
Rog. That's in work. [Pause.]
And for your information, Houston, when the Sun is shining on window 5, it's pretty hazy; window number 1 is a little bit better.
Okay. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is Apollo 8. [No answer.]
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, go ahead.
Roger. We tried to get this realignment. We need - Do you have a maneuver to get us the - some gimbal angles so we don't get gimbal lock when we get the preferred alignment? [Pause.]
Stand by on that.
Thank you.
Houston, on our present position, we'll go into gimbal lock, I figure, to try and get the preferred angles.
Say again, Apollo 8.
In running through Program 52, we got a Program Alarm 401 which would indicate that if we continued, we'd drive it into gimbal lock.
Roger. I understand. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. This should be an Option 1 like Option 3. [Pause.]
Houston, we're doing an Option 1 like Option 3. We keep getting a 401 alarm, which says desired ICDU yields gimbal lock.
Rog. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston. Appears that you have maneuvered around the gimbal lock [garble].
Roger. Roger.
Okay. Sorry we were late on that answer.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Well, we stopped and went through coarse align of P52 and then we got fine align, and pick-a-pair, pick Capella, but she drove and didn't get to any place. I didn't pick Capella, and I can't recognize any out there right now. Can I recycle here and go back and pick a pair? [Pause.]
That's affirmative, Apollo 8.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
My plan is to go back into re-enter Program 52 - well, it did not drive to Capella, and I can't recognize it in the scanning telescope. My plan is to go back into recall P52.
Okay. Stand by one.
Apollo 8, can you confirm that you zeroed the optics prior to starting?
Roger. That's affirmative. We zeroed the optics. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. You have a Go for a second try in P52 with an Option 3.
Okay. I now have Aldebaran in the scanning telescope; I might want to call that one instead of Capella.
Okay.
I'll see what it comes up with first, though.
Houston, Apollo 8. We came up with an unacceptable difference in our stars; we're going to have to recycle.
Roger.
If we don't get this midcourse in, what will that do to our pericynthion?
Stand by. We'll... [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. In the event that we don't get this midcourse in, we're still go for an LOI, and it's been suggested you might try Mirfak which is octal 10.
That's the one we're trying now.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
We're all set up and counting down at 8 minutes.
Roger. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, our data is down right now; appreciate making sure you have the tape recorder on. [Pause.]
Roger. I'm going to go - I'll have to go Command Reset. You've got control [of the tape recorder].
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. You have some pitch and yaw angles for our PTC after the burn? [Pause.]
Okay, Apollo 8. That's pitch, 348; yaw, 315. [Pause.]
Pitch, 348; yaw, 315.
That's affirmative. And would you give us another hack on your countdown time? [Pause.]
It's 5:18, 17, 16, 15, 14.
Thank you.
Houston, I'll give you a mark at 4 minutes.
Rog. Thank you.
3, 2, 1...
Mark. Four minutes.
Apollo 8, Houston. How about switching the Biomed switch over to the left.
Roger. 3, 2, 1...
Mark. Switched.
DSKY blanks at minus 35 seconds.
Alright, stand by.
DSKY blank.
Okay.
Limit Cycle, Off.
Limit Cycle, Off.
EMS Mode, Auto.
Auto.
Okay, at zero [i.e. ignition] [Verb] 16 [Noun] 85, null VGX, Y. and Z. Null component. Tell me when you're going to burn.
Okay, stand by.
At the flash.
4, 1...
Burn.
11 seconds.
Burning.
11 seconds.
Should be Off by now.
[Garble.] That's good.
Okay, 12 seconds.
12 seconds?
Okay, record Delta-V Counter, residuals; Tape Recorder is going to Stop
Okay, now do Verb 66, Enter.
Verb 66, Enter.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. Burn on time, angles nominal, burn time about 12 seconds, 0.2 feet per second after the Delta-VC, 0 in VGX. We have transferred the result of the burn over to the LM slot with Verb 66.
Roger. And got a couple of items to clean up. We'll get you an RCS budget. We've got one redline now; we're trying to get some firmer numbers for you, and we'll have those in a little bit. Right now your use - your PTC usage is right on the Flight Plan line, so everything looks pretty good there. We want to get a crew status report from you. We'd like to firm up the Rev 2 Flight Plan idea; and sometime at your convenience, we'd like to take a reading of the PRD [Personal Radiation Dosimeter] for the Commander and CMP and then have you swap them. We are trying to isolate the - what the possible reason is for the discrepancies or the disparity in the two readings.
Roger. [Long pause.]
And we're maneuvering to the PTC attitude, Houston.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Could you give us the sign of that Z residual? [Long pause.]
Stand by, Houston.
Alright, Houston. Looks like we didn't record the Z. We recorded Delta-VC, which is minus two tenths.
Okay. Understand.
And Z was one tenth 0.1, but we didn't get the sign.
Roger. Understand that was Delta-VC was minus 0.2. I copied Delta-VZ; Zulu is 0.2. Is that incorrect?
Roger. It was 0.1, but we didn't get the sign.
Okay. Thank you.
We can get it. We have it on the tape, Houston, whenever you want to dump it.
Rog. Thank you.
It'll be about the last 5 minutes worth.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston, for the PRD's: CDR is 0.07, CMP is 0.64, LMP is 0.80. Note that the CMP's hasn't changed since we started and the Commander's hasn't changed much. We have swapped PRDs; Commander has LMP, CMP has Commander's, and LMP has CMP's PRD. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. Crew status report as follows: water, the Commander has about 50 clicks so far today; CMP, 43; and the LMP is 44. We've eaten two meals so far today. Day 3, meal A and B; consumed most of it except for the - the hard, hard bites, which no one cares for. Pudding was outstanding. [Pause.] We're at a gain of pericynthion now of plus 63 [nautical] miles [117 km]. [Pause.] Commander and CMP have had a rest period just before the midcourse 4 of about 2 hours.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
We're at a gain of about 20,500 miles from the Moon at 61:14. How does that agree with what you figure?
Apollo 8, Houston. Looks like you're on the secondary loop. We'd like to run that for about 5 minutes.
Roger. We're doing the ECS redundant component check.
Rog. We'll follow.
Getting any data now Houston? Guess you are. Okay. See you stopped my tape then. I've been running for about 3 extra minutes here to record the check.
Rog. We have data now. There was a temporary loss. [Pause.]
What's the matter? Was it chow time down there?
Rog. [Pause.] Didn't know you could smell it that far away. [Pause.]
Give me a call when you're satisfied with the secondary loop; it's stabilized out here pretty well.
Wilco, and you might tell Jim that RTCC is about 4 miles off; we had 20,496 [nautical miles, 37,959 km]. [Pause.]
Fine. [Long pause.]
We just put compressor 2 on AC2.
Houston, Apollo 8. Do you show battery B voltage dropped some from the post-charge value? Over. [Pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. Confirm that battery B is a little bit lower, and this is attributed to the parasitic loads that are on there. [Pause.]
Okay. I just didn't see the same kind of drop for A. So if you think it's okay, it's fine.
That's affirm. You don't have the same parasite loads on there; B is actually drawing something.
Okay. I guess that's the radiators, huh? [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. We've seen enough of the secondary evaporator. We'd like for you to wait about 2 minutes between the time you go to Reset and the time you turn the pump off.
I agree; good idea. [Pause.] And we plan to leave the water control in Auto.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. Looking over the - our redundant component check here, it appears we have not yet checked the integrity of the secondary loop radiators; and if you haven't done that sometime, we'd like to open up the secondary radiators but not flow through them and just measure the accumulator pressure. [Pause.]
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Houston, we don't show that in our pre-LOI check, but we're willing to go ahead and do it if you want to.
Rog. We just noticed that it isn't there, and, yes, we would like to. [Pause.] You understand that we are not proposing that you flow, but merely we check for any pressure decay.
Roger. Wait 'til I get my trusty assistant here to help me.
Okay, Houston. We're going to blow the secondary - or we're gonna open the secondary rads for 30 seconds now.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Looks pretty good.
Sure does. [Long pause.]
Okay. They're closed now.
Okay. Thank you. Looks good.
Roger. No meteoroids yet.
Apollo 8, Houston. You take your tape recorder to stop, why, we'll reset it then and give it back to you.
Roger. It's stopped.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We still need to talk about the Rev 2 attitudes we're going to use to work around the fact that you have a fogged center window. Whenever that's convenient, we'd like to go over what your thoughts are on the subject and make sure we can get our Flight Plan squared away.
My thoughts are to make to do with the best with what we have. We are not interested in changing a lot of things right now, Ken.
Okay. The one proposal that sounds like it has some advantage to it: if we let Jim do his evaluation through the telescope, you do everything exactly the same except you turn and roll over 180 degrees so that your head's up, and let Jim do his tracking through the telescope and you'll still be a yaw right when you go to pick up your TV and that type of thing. It looks like that probably will cover everything. We can do that or we can just go as is and just have to let some of that tracking evaluation go by. Another alternate would be to have Jim look out the right-hand rendevous window, and you may have to change your attitude in order to get the same picture there also. [Pause.]
I think we'll try to do that, but I don't - this is one of the things that we'll work out when we get there.
Okay. The reason we were looking into it in the Flight Plan is, if you do want to try rolling over and flying heads up or something of that nature, we can help Bill get a little more out of his photography by giving him some new film settings and that type of thing. We'll have something like that available; in case you do fly heads up, why, we'll have some numbers we can call up for film settings.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead. [Pause.]
Roger. We are going to have to dump some urine here shortly. Will this bother your tracking? [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, we're checking on that with the tracking people now. [Long pause.]
Houston, just give us the time when we can start on it, and we'll hold off until you say so.
Okay. And you can anticipate a handover between stations here on the hour, and you might get a slight glitch as we go through. I'll give you a call when we get back.
Thank you, Ken. What station are we going to be going to, Ken? [Pause.]
We'll be going to Honeysuckle.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Apollo 8, Houston. You're cleared for a dump at this time, and understand this is the last gas station for a long time.
You mean you don't want us to dump after this for a while?
That's affirm. Due to the tracking as you approach the LOI, they would like to minimize any of these type of perturbations.
Apollo 8, Houston through Honeysuckle.
Roger. Houston through Honeysuckle. We read you loud and clear.
Okay. Good morning.
Good morning.
Thought you went to sleep.
You got off over to Australia - you got over to Australia pretty fast.
Rog. [Pause.] That gas station call wake you up?
Man, I've been all eyeballs and elbows here for the last several hours.
I'll bet. If you've got nothing else to do, I do have two charts in your LOI table that I need to give you more update numbers on.
Standby. [Long pause.]
We'll get our LOI tables man [i.e. Jim] on the line here. Houston. Stand by.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Okay; Houston, CMP here. I understand you have some updates for me.
Yes, sir; I've got a couple of charts in your chart book under LOI, and I have some numbers to fill in, one of them being the chart of LOI Delta-V magnitude versus abort Delta-V.
Okay. Stand by, and I'll get it out.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, I have the chart out. Go ahead.
Alright. Mode 1, 5 hours; roll, 1.38; pitch, 7.89; yaw, 357.37. Mode 1, 15 minutes; roll, 180.73; pitch, 29.46; yaw, 1.65. Over.
Roger. The new attitudes for the Mode 1, 5-hour, Mode 15 minute are as follows: roll; for the one - Mode 1, 5-hour; roll, 1.38; pitch, 7.89; yaw, 357.37. Mode 1, 15 minute; roll, 180.73; pitch, 29.46; yaw, 1.65.
Okay. That's correct. Now I also have to give you a couple of points to plot on that curve. The present curve you have drawn is based on a 60-mile perigee or perilune, and you right now have a 62-mile pericynthion; and the reason that your target is for 62 miles is to pass over the landing site, so I have five sets of coordinates for you to copy.
Is this to go on the same chart to redraw the curve?
That's affirmative.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. We'll go in on the LOI Delta-V magnitude, 1600; abort Delta-V, 2450, two-four-five-zero. [Long pause.]
Okay. LOI Delta-V magnitude, 1600; abort Delta-V, 2450. Stand by just one. [Pause.] I have it; continue.
Okay. The next one is the LOI Delta-V, 2000; abort Delta-V, 3130. [Long pause.]
Roger. I've got that plotted.
2400, LOI Delta-V; abort Delta-V, 3880, three-eight-eight-zero. [Long pause.]
I've got it plotted.
2800, LOI; abort Delta-V, 4700. Over. [Long pause.]
Roger. I have that one plotted, too.
Alright. The last one is LOI Delta-V, 2990; abort Delta-V, 5114. That's almost directly into the end of the present curve; 5114. [Pause.]
Say again the LOI Delta-V magnitude, please.
Alright. LOI Delta-V, 2990.
Rog. 2990. [Long pause.] Okay. I have it plotted.
Alright. And on the next one, you should have a chart, number 10, and we have three numbers to go in there for a Mode 3 gimbal angle. [Long pause.]
Roger. Go ahead with the Mode 3 gimbal angles.
Roll, 180.87; pitch, 42.31; yaw, 1.65.
Mode 3 gimbal angles are as follows: roll, 180.87; pitch, 42.31; yaw, 1.65.
Roger. That's correct.
Could you please send up a French curve for me?
Rog.
Send up a couple.
The only one I have is about 6 foot. [Pause.]
Houston, could you give us a - some gimbal angles to point at the Moon? I never have seen it the whole trip, and I'm wondering which way it is from us now.
Rog. 180.
Houston, Apollo 8. Radio check.
Rog. Loud and clear.
Roger. [Pause.]
And we're getting ready to give you a rundown on your systems. We're going over all the final steps, and we'll tell you what we see in the way of trajectory and systems information. And once again, Dr. Joe Kerwin has brought over all the latest news, and we can read that up to you a little bit at a time if you aren't going to sleep.
What's he going to do, read out of the AMA [American Medical Association] Journal?
Rog.
Go ahead. We're all ears.
Okay. Here's one: the previously scheduled 72-hour ceasefire by the Viet Cong went into effect today, 17 hours before the 24-hour allied truce was to begin. [Long pause.]
You lost us on the numbers there. What was that again?
The gist of it was that the VC went into a ceasefire earlier than the truce that we had planned on, as a Christmas holiday type. [Pause.]
Rog. Good.
Houston, how do you read Apollo 8.
Loud and clear. Sorry to have stepped on you there. We're going over the summary of the systems data.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. I have a rundown on your systems here, G&C status. Everything looks real...
Just a...
Go ahead.
Just a minute. [Long pause.]
I want to wait 'til the LMP gets on the head set, Houston.
Roger.
Okay, Houston, go ahead.
Flying EECOM's on the line.
Okay. We'll just start with the EECOM business, then. I'll give you a summary of your batteries; battery A, we calculate 38.3 amp-hours. battery B...
Stand by a second, Ken. [Pause.]
Let me get my chart out.
Rog.
Go ahead now.
Okay. Battery A, 38.3; battery B, 36.9; battery C, 38.5. That's looking pretty good. Looks like we got all the things back in that we took out, and we're running right along prediction. We would like to get a battery C voltage from you if you can reach over there and switch it. [Pause.]
Roger. [Pause.] 37 volts on battery C.
Rog. 37 volts. Okay. The predicted cryo quantities at [CM/SM] Sep: on oxygen tank 1, 170 [pounds, 77 kg]; oxygen tank 2, 170 [pounds, 77 kg]; hydrogen 1, 9.5 [pounds, 4.3 kg]; and hydrogen 2, 10.0 [pounds, 4.5 kg]. You essentially have single cryo tank capabilities all the way at full power now.
Fine.
The secondary coolant loop really looked good. Looks like you had a nice tight radiator and everything else on there was working right along the performance curves. Your main oxygen regulators both filled at 104 psi during our check. Looking at the lunar orbit, expect to be doing a water boil of about 1 pound per hour, and this is just an approximation; there's quite a variety of estimates as to what the water boiling requirements may be. May go anywhere from boiling lots to not boiling at all.
[Garble] stay on normal voice, doesn't it? [Pause.]
Okay. Looks like may not be able to hack the normal voice. [Pause.] On the cryo tanks, we've had quite a bit of destratification, particularly in the oxygen, and you notice this during the fan cycles and Delta-V's, so we're going to be sure and we'll remind you again to stir up the oxygen prior to LOI.
On the SPS, the oxidizer and fuel feed line temperatures are 75 [degrees Fahrenheit, 24°C] and holding steady. The Service Module RCS quad package temps are cycling and holding between 120 and 140 [degrees Fahrenheit, 49°C and 60°C], and looks like we're getting good normal heater operation. [Pause.] We plan to have you in a 60-[nautical] mile [111 km] circular orbit after LOI-2. [Pause.] And we should have some PAD's for you on the LOI burn at about 67 hours. [Long pause.]
Roger. We got all that.
Okay. We're still going through the tracking, and as you know, we're going to hold down on water dumps and so forth during the last couple of hours in and out, sort of aid the tracking procedures. Everything's running along the line normally now. Do you have any other specific questions? We are looking for an angle on the Moon. I guess that about summarizes the system. Everything looks Go right now.
Okay, Ken. Thank you. We just completed day 3, meal C, and now we're going to break up and each take a rest period before LOI.
Okay, real fine. Everybody wanted to ask if you wouldn't try and get some sack time here before we go in. It's going to be a big day.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Finally found out where the Moon is, and your present PTC attitude, if you happen to look out the right window [window 5, beside Bill's couch] as you go by, roll attitude of 320, it should be there.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. Bill would like to ask the doctor's permission to take a Seconal [sleeping pill].
Okay. Standby.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. Did you call? We lost track for a minute.
Okay, Apollo 8. You're cleared to go ahead with that pill. Take - Surgeon recommends a small one.
Small one. Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. If you can, we'd like to have you stir up the oxygen cryo.
Okay, I'll do that right now. Two minutes each. Just the oxygen?
Okay. We want to get both the oxygen and hydrogen.
You say just the oxygen, Ken?
No, sir; both the oxygen and the hydrogen.
Okay. Start, starting with the hydrogen.
Thank you.
Okay. Houston, Apollo 8. We've cycled through all of the cryo fans.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Apollo 8.
Okay. Thank you.
Rog. We had a momentary loss there.
How's the tracking?
Looking great.
How's the tracking data look, Ken?
Looking great.
Roger.
