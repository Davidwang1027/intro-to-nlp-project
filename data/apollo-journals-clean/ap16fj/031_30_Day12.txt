Good morning, Apollo 16.
Good morning, good morning up there.
Good morning, good morning down there.
Well, we see on this biomed that old Charlie woke up. He was really sawing away there.
Sure was.
I wouldn't be surprised. That's probably why it doesn't work. Termites do the same thing.
Apollo 16, Houston. Would you switch your High Gain to Medium?
Yeah, Medium on the High Gain.
Okay.
Apollo 16, Houston.
Go ahead. Over.
Okay. We've only got one minor change to your Flight Plan. Some high gain angles for a P52 at 285:48 when you want them.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. Pitch, minus 28; Yaw, 96. And Stu will be in, in a little while, to talk about changes to your Entry Checklist. But that should do it for the Flight Plan. All your systems looked nominal through the night. We don't know about the Mid-Course 7 yet. Right now, you're in the corridor and it looks - it looks pretty good - like maybe you won't have to do one. If you did one, it wouldn't be any more than a foot and a half.
Understand.
You're just slightly shallow. Give you a little softer ride.
And could you go Wide on the High Gain, please?
High Gain, Wide.
Thank you.
16, Houston.
Go ahead, Over.
Hey, John. This is Gold Flight. We're going to be handing over down here shortly and our last shift with you - We wanted to let you know that we really commend you for a job well done and be looking forward to seeing you when you get back to Houston.
Okay, Gold Flight. I tell you, we certainly enjoyed you, particularly on that descent. That was something else, wasn't it?
It was a pretty long day. I'm sure it was for you. It sure was for us.
Yeah, you bet.
Gerry, thanks for everything. We'll be seeing you when we get back.
Okay, Charlie.
Incidentally, I talked to Lee yesterday, and he sends you all a 'Very well done.'
Thank you.
Tony, you still there?
Yeah. Go ahead.
Would you have your friend on the left take a look at my biomed?
Okay. He says you look healthy.
Okay. Thank you.
Incidentally, I think Lee's comments really mean you passed the course. I hope so anyway.
If we didn't, we'd like to go back and try again.
That would be a good deal, wouldn't it?
Yeah, maybe you can fix that up for us so we can go back and try it again.
There's another 400 or 500 pounds up there, Tony, we'd like to bring you.
We didn't make Lee's ton a year, but we're working on it.
Yeah, if you don't get a - get a ton - Lee's going to be disappointed. No, I don't think so. I think he's pretty happy.
Okay, Houston. With the crew status report.
Go ahead.
Okay. For the Commander, A1 is still stowed, A3 is 7 hours, A4 is none, A5 is 1725...
John, we lost comm there about the CDR's A-5. If you can do that one again, please.
Okay. A-5: 17, 25, and 16; A-6 is: 1 is 8, 2 is 4, 3 is 6, 4 is 5, and 5 is 8. All those - all those quantities are in ounces.
Okay.
CMP: B-1, 15072; B-3, 6 hours; B-4, none - B-2 is 40 and 50. B-6: 1 is 5 ounces; 2 is 6 ounces; 3, 5 ounces; 4, 5 ounces.
Okay.
On the LMP: C-1, 21180; C-3, 7 hours; C-4, none; C-5, 18, 25, 15; C-6: 5 ounces - number 1 is 5 ounces, number 2 is 7 ounces.
Okay, back to the - to the chow. Yesterday, we were working on Day 11 food, and we - For the CDR Meal A, scratch the coffee with K; meal B, scratch the rye bread, change the tuna spread to 2/3, and change the - change the tuna spread from tuna spread to ham salad, and change the cocoa with K to citrus beverage with K.
And on Meal C, scratch the romaine soup and the pecans, and add ½ tuna salad.
Okay.
On the CMP: for breakfast, scratch the grits; Meal B, scratch the grapefruit bar and the graham crackers; Meal C, substitute ham for beef steak, scratch the chicken and rice, scratch the pecans, scratch the grape drink, add orange-pineapple drink, gingerbread.
And also an orange-grapefruit drink.
Okay.
And on the LMP: for breakfast, scratch the bacon squares from Meal A; Meal B, scratch the lobster bisque, and the rye - and the rye bread. Wait a second here, somebody's got a little disagreement on what we ate here. It's not, incidentally, the first time that that's happened.
We'd like you to get started toward that galactic anti-centerpoint attitude, whatever that is.
Okay, we're going that way.
Okay.
Okay, let's start over on Meal B for the LMP.
All right.
I've been correc - I've been corrected here. Do not scratch the lobster bisque. And substitute for tuna spread, ham spread. And do not scratch the rye bread. Scratch the cherry fruit bar, and the citrus beverage with K, and substitute the cocoa with K.
Okay.
On Meal C, scratch the beef steak, scratch the fruitcake and the pecans, and add tuna salad, ¾ of a tin.
Okay, got it.
Okay, and the injector valve temps are looking as follows: 5C, 4.5; 5D, 4.6; 6A, 4.1; 6B, 4.4; 6C, 4.9; 6D, 4.4. Which means no heatup.
Okay, copy that.
Apollo 16, we'd like Auto on the High Gain.
You have it.
Hey, fellows. Hank's here, and have a good ride in. We'll see you in a couple of days.
Okay. Thank you much, Tony.
You betcha.
We'll see you, and we enjoyed working with you, Tony.
Thank you.
Okay. We just got her again.
Roger. Copy.
And, Houston; this time we've got the ISS light on and it's remaining on.
Roger. Copy, Ken.
Program alarm was resettable, as you probably noticed.
Roger. And you - But you still have the light, is that affirmative?
That's affirmative.
Affirmative.
Okays, Houston, could we proceed through Malfunction Number 6 here?
They're debating that, Ken. Just a second.
Okay. Ken, why don't you press on through that malfunction 6 there on Page 28; and remember, if you get down to box 12, you have to kill the DAP.
Okay.
Do you have any questions on killing the DAP, Ken?
Okay, that time when I went to do a Verb 40, just about the time it should have run its time out and blanked the DSKY, we got another Program Alarm, and a - shows 3777 again.
Roger, that.
Do you still have the ISS light, Ken?
That's affirmative.
16, Houston. We'd like to proceed with the malfunction procedure.
Okay. Would you like to do Block 6 again?
Stand by, Ken. They're looking at it. There's speculation we've got a - the fail bit set and stuck there.
Okay, Ken. Let's proceed with Block 6 and go on down to 12, and - but I think we're gonna see the same thing all over again, but let's try it.
You say skip Block 6?
Okay.
Same thing, Hank.
Okay, understand.
Okay, Hank. I'm not sure how to answer Block 6. I'll go to Block 12 if you like.
Stand by a minute, Ken.
Okay. Do you have any way of isolating whether it's - the bit is set or whether it's receiving continuous input?
Okay. Everybody's looking at that now. We're trying to psych out what's going wrong here.
Okay. Thank you, sir.
16, Houston. It appears to us that the input channel bit just cleared. Did you do anything?
No, sir. And the ISS light is out.
Let me tell you what the only thing we can think of that might have happened. Charlie's down in the LEB, and Tool E, it sounded like, got knocked against the Panel down there, if you can believe that.
Tool E hit the panel and the light went away?
That, we can't say that for sure. That's the only action that - that I can think of that was going on at the time.
Roger.
And I'm not even sure that was. I just heard a clank.
Apollo 16, Houston. We would like to get on with the activity at 285:30 regarding the SIM bay. However, we would like to leave the Gamma Ray Shield on. We don't want to take it Off.
Okay.
Ken, looks like the Gamma Ray Boom is not gonna come in any further; we've seen it stalled. But it is safe for - with a safe position. You can go ahead and turn the Boom switch to Off. And for planning purposes, we are gonna do a Mid-Course 7, and it's about 1½ feet per second.
Okay.
We'll turn the Gamma Ray Boom to Off.
Hank, do you folks want us to go ahead and try the 52?
Roger, Ken. We'd like to do the P52, and since the problem's cleared up, I imagine you can use the Verb 49 maneuver.
We'll certainly give that a try. Hank, do we have the entry REFSMMAT plugged in yet?
Stand by.
If you'll give us Accept, we'll pump your loads up to you.
Okay, you have it.
We're sending you a state vector, a target load, and a REFSMMAT.
Apollo 16, Houston. I have your MCC-7 PAD.
Okay, go ahead, Hank.
Roger. MCC-7, RCS/G&N; 27276; Noun 48 is NA; Noun 33, 287:23:00.26; minus 0001.4, plus all zips, plus four balls 1; 180, 310, 000; HA is NA, plus 0021.7; 0001.4, 0:04, 0001.4; sextant star 13, 312.7, 33.7; boresight star NA; Noun 61, minus 00.71, minus 156.18; 1045.8, 36276; 290:23:59. Sirius and Rigel; 279, 045, 014. Four jets. Remarks: EMS not bias for drift. High Gain angles, Pitch, minus 85; Yaw, 119. End of PAD, and the computer is yours.
Okay. MCC-7, RCS/G&N; 27276; Noun 48 not applicable; 287:23:00.26; minus three balls 1.4, plus all balls, plus 0000.1; 180, 310, 000; HA is not applicable, 21.7; Delta-VT 1.4, burn time 4 seconds, Delta VC 1.4; 13 sextant star, 312.7, 33.7; latitude minus 7.1, longitude minus 156.18; 1045.8, 36276; 290:23:59. Sirius and Rigel; 279, 045, and 014. Four Jets, plus-X. EMS not bias for drift. Pitch on High Gain, minus 85; Yaw, 119 - minus 119.
That's a good readback, John, except the Noun 61, the latitude is 0.71, minus 0.71.
Okay, 0.71.
Omni Charlie, Apollo 16.
Apollo 16, Houston. We're clear to turn the Data System Off down on Panel 230.
Okay.
Hank, did you copy my question about post-torque versus coarse align for the REFSMMAT change?
Negative, Ken. But I'll check it.
Okay. That's in light of these funnies. I'd hate to have it - end up losing all track of what it's doing.
Roger.
Omni Delta.
Omni Delta.
Roger.
Apollo 16, Houston. Normal procedures on the P52 coarse align.
Okay. Thank you, sir.
Apollo 16, Omni Alpha.
Apollo 16, Houston. Have a Entry PAD for you.
Okay. Just a second, Henry.
Apollo 16, are you clear to torque?
Clear to torque. And, 16; we're still standing by with that Entry PAD.
Okay.
And, 16; after we get this PAD up, Stu is gonna have some words for you about the checklist change.
Okay. Go ahead with the PAD.
Okay, MidPac; 000, 153, 000; 290:06:32. 267: minus 00.71, minus 156.18; 06.9; 36196, 6.50; 1045.8, 36276; 290:23:32; 00:27; Noun 69 is NA; 4.00, 02:02; 00:16, 03:33, 07:43; sextant star 25, 151.5, 26.2; boresight NA; lift vector UP.

Good readback, John.
16, Houston.
Good morning, Stuart.
Oh, jolly good, there. I - I've got a couple or three changes to your checklist and your cue card, if you want to fish those out.
Okay, got the cue card and an Entry Checklist.
Okay, let's go to the Entry Checklist, Page E/1-2.
Okay, E/l-2. You're starting early in the book.
Oh, Roger. Okay, let's go down here to the - the end of the logic sequence check.
Okay.
Right after we've opened the SECS circuit breakers there, we want to write in "Battery compartment pressure check - Systems Test, 7-A. If off-scale high, open Vent Valve through entry."
Okay, battery compartment pressure check - that's meter 7-A. If off-scale high, open through entry - and, just for your information, right now it's about 2.9.
Okay; copy. Okay, and then at the bottom of that page, after the P52, put in - I'm sorry - let's do it before the P52. Add "Start EMP 509." And this is just an arbitrary point that we've - that we've picked, Ken. We're getting close enough now that we think we ought to have 509 running. We would prefer you to go ahead and do the P52 in SCS, as you have been doing. But let's just have 509 running before you go into that P52.
Okay, that's fair.
Okay, let's go over to 1-3 and...
All right.
Down under the boresight - this is the standard bit - delete your "Verb 41 Noun 91," and add "Verb 16 Noun 91 Enter; use Manual Optics."
Okay, Manual on the boresight.
Okay. And now, after you drive the Optics to 90 degrees, we want to delete the Optics power, off. And we want to verify Optics Speed, Lo. And we're going to leave the Optics power on and, here in the mysterious world of glitches, this is going to minimize the probability. So we're gonna come in with it on, and we'll put the Speed to Lo just to hold down the drift.
Okay, after the 90-degree shaft, why, we'll - delete Optics power off and verify that the Speed is Lo.
Okay, now let's go to 2-2. Thank you. I need to be looking at this instead of that.
Okay, 2-2.
Okay. Now, after we get down to - after the P61 entry prep and prior to entering P61, we want to add - and the - what we're doing here, Ken, is we're resetting the average-g flag, which we set in 509. And if we do not do this step - now this is a - a pretty critical step - if we do not reset that average-g flag, P61 will not call average g. So our procedure here before we go into P61 is a Verb 25 Noun 7 Enter, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, Enter. And if for some reason P61 would not call up average g, your fastest and most obvious cue is that lack of the comp cycle before Noun 61 comes up. If you don't reset this, your Noun 61 comes up immediately, but - with 509 running, we've got to get this step in or we'll not pick up our average g.
Okay, That's a good one to know.
Roger. And how about just reading that step back to me there.
Okay. Before calling P61, I'm going to reset the average-g flag with a Verb 25 Noun 7, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, and 0 Enter. And I'll do that prior to calling P61.
Okay. Jolly good. And let's go over to 2-4.
Okay. On 2-4.
Okay. And what we're doing here now is, after you have Pro and you activate the Entry DAP, at that time, your Noun 46 first digit is dropped to a zero. To reactivate EMP 509, after the flashing 06 61 comes up, let's insert in there a Verb 21 Noun 46 Enter, 30000 Enter. And, of course, all we're doing here is putting the 3 back in Noun 46 and this was dropped, as I say, when you went into the Entry DAP.
Okay. The - you want to do that after - Line 13, or before that?
Okay. After line 13, in between the flashing 06 61 and before the PRO.
Okay. Stu, after flashing 61 and before Proceeding on that, we'll do a Verb 21 Noun 46, 30000 Enter.
Roger. You'll do a Verb 21 Noun 46 Enter, 30000 Enter.
That's right.
Okay. And you got the picture of why we're having to do that?
Yes, sir.
Okay. Now the - now, if you'll pick up your cue card, we'll change it to the same things that we've just gone over in the checklist here.
Okay.
Okay. Prior to your P61, add Verb 25 Noun 7 Enter, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, 0 Enter.
Okay. I'll reset that flag before P61.
Okay. And, back down here in your P62 box, same thing we just talked about. Prior to the Pro, after the 06 61, add Verb 21 Noun 46 Enter, 30000 Enter.
Okay. Got that.
Okay. And - got a - a change here to your Systems Checklist - and this is just changing to reflect the increased pressure in the battery compartment. If you'd like to change that, it's Page S/l-2, under Step 3.
Okay.
Okay. Down - toward the bottom of the page, about three lines up, we've got a comment in there. "If greater than 1.5, Battery Vent valve, Vent." We want to change that 1.5 to 3.4.
Okay. We change that to 3.4.
Okay. It's a pretty innocuous change. And the one - the line right above that, too - "Systems Test 7-A, battery compartment pressure less than 1.5," change that to 3.4, also.
Okay.
Okay. Those are the changes, Ken. And - we're working up a - a list here. It'll be pretty straightforward. I don't want to give them to you now. We're massaging them - of the cues that will indicate to you - the CDU glitches just prior to and during the entry phase. And I'd like to talk to you about that in a little bit when we get all squared away.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger. Oh, I'd like to also add here, Ken, and - of course, as you well know, we - in this mysterious glitch solutions, we gotta shotgun it, and we're trying to find the areas that are a prime candidate for glitch in the CDU. And one of these is during your GDC align procedure, when you have your Att Set switch to Att Set and you either switch in to or out of IMU on the Source. What you're doing here is loading up the CDU's, and they feel that this is a prime candidate for a glitch. So, our words of wisdom are to minimize the number of times that you use this switch, and I guess after your GDC align in the normal checklist;, we'd kind of like to see you not cycle that Source switch to IMU with your Att Set switch in Att Set. I guess you could still check your GDC versus Noun 20s if you wanted to, but I did want you to be aware of this particular switch combination as - as loading up the CDU. And this is where we have the probability of glitches.
Okay, thank you.
And just...
As you know, we've - we've only aligned the GDC IMU a thousand times, and I don't think that's had anything to do with the glitch we've had so far.
Yeah, we realize that, John. The problem is - we don't know what - what's causing the glitch. We just, at this time, can't say.
That's true, but I'm saying that - Oh, never mind, never mind.
Houston, 16.
Go ahead.
You folks have any objections if we pump up the cabin to about 5.7 now so we can have full packages and have a little pad on the cabin pressure? The regs are running a little low.
Okay. Go ahead, Ken.
Thank you.
Ken, it all looks good down here. We don't think you need the Verb 40.
Okay. I agree. Sure gets your attention, though.
Roger.
Wait a couple hours, Ken, and it'll even get your attention faster. And when all of you've got a chance to listen, I've got a couple of words on the - on the CDU transient fuse.
Okay. Why don't you wait a few minutes. We're still cleaning up a little stowage here.
Okay.
Well, here we go again.
Roger. We see it.
Okay, Houston. I got it out that time by kicking the panel. Sounds to me like switch - it sounds to me like same kind of contamination in the - in the switch.
Where...
In the relay or whatever.
Where did you kick, John?
I kicked right - I put my - I - when it went out, I was kicking right over the Noun 99 codes, and just below that - I think it was...
LEB and the...
Yeah, I think I was...
Optics panel.
kicking on the region of the - What's just below there, the PSA with the modules in it?
All right. Maybe there was something to that Tool E hitting it awhile ago.
Could have been. Or maybe it just went out.
Apollo 16, Houston. We'd like to verify the S-Band Aux TV switch, Off.
You want it -
Okay, it's verified Off now.
Okay, thank you.
Apollo 16, Houston. You're Go for Mid-Course 7.
Roger. Go for 7.
Apollo 16, I request your Key Release.
It'll - clear up at average g.
Okay, burn's complete. Residuals, plus 0.1, minus 0, plus 1 or plus - Yeah.
Roger; copy.
Okay. I'm maneuvering to the UV photo attitude.
Roger.
Apollo 16, Omni Delta.
16, Houston.
Hello there.
Roger. Just a little info. We're gonna be - we'll give you a call, but we'll be bringing the batteries on at EI minus 45, about 15 minutes early, just so we'll have a little extra time to take a look at them.
Okay.
Houston, we've got the UV camera all set up. And it looks like we're pointing at the Earth. How about if we go ahead and take this - UV sequence now, instead of waiting until 55.
Stand by.
Ken, you can go ahead with the photos.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, we're going around the closeout panels and we're down here around 382 and - are you happy with the mixing valve position or are you going to want to change it before we close it out?
I'll get you an answer on that, Ken.
Looks like a good setting, Ken.
Okay, we're going to close out the panel.
Houston, you're gonna give us another Entry PAD after you work this Mid-Course for a while, aren't you?
That's affirmative. Be about another hour and 20 minutes.
Okay.
And, for planning purposes, we're gonna be bringing - like to bring the batteries on a little earlier. But we'll give you a cue on that. We just want to look at them since we had this venting problem.
Roger. Old battery vent is up to almost 3 now - 2.99.
Roger.
Hank, we got the Earth out of Window 5. It's a very thin crescent and the subsolar point is - spectacularly bright.
Sounds great.
It looks great, I'll tell you.
We show you a little - well, about 20,700 miles out now and about 13,400 feet per second.
Starting to haul it in.
Houston, 16's ready for the Logic check, whenever you are.
Stand by, Ken. We're getting a checkpoint here.
Okay.
Okay, 16. Go ahead with the Logic check.
Okay. The Logic's coming on. Number 1, on; number 2 - that's - two Logics are on.
Roger. You're Go for Pyro Arm, as required.
Thank you, sir.
Okay. Let's do that check, again.
I understand you'd like to repeat?
Yes, please. Okay, now - the SECS/Logic is coming on now.
It still looks good, 16.
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, now.
Apollo 16, Houston. We saw a C&W about the time you started the logic check. Were you testing the lights, or did you really get a warning there?
He was doing a light test.
Roger. Copy.
Okay, Houston. The battery compartment is reading about 3. So, according to the rules, we do not go to vent.
Roger. That's - we concur.
Okay, Houston. We have EMP 509 loaded.
Roger. Copy.
And we're going to hold onto P52 until we get down to the nominal time.
Roger.
Apollo 16, Houston.
Go ahead. Over.
Okay. I don't know how you're coming along in your time line there. I would like to make a couple of comments if you've got time to listen. I don't think you want to copy anything at this point.
Okay. Looks like we're between - just before doing the P52. Go ahead, Stu.
Okay. This deals with the - our favorite problem, of course, the - your ISS warning. And, right now, you people are doing all the right things and we're wanting to do those same procedures right through - right through entry when, of course, when ISS comes on, I'm sure you're going to go to Spacecraft Control, which you've been doing and you've been checking that alarm code. And we're saying that, if you have that 3 triple 7, to ignore it. Whe - it's - whether it needs it or not, just to keep the procedure straightforward, we - after you - while you're still in SCS, do a Verb 40 Enter and wait your 10 seconds, and go back to CMC. So, this means that we're saying - we'll come all the way in CMC with that 3 triple 7 alarm showing. If you do get a - if you do have a CDU failure, why, you will see it in your - in your bank angle - your - which is just your normal procedures there where you're looking at your commanded DSKY angle versus what the spacecraft is doing. Also, if you have got a glitch in the CDU, such as we got on the way out, and it's not the 90-degree bit - of course, if the 90-degree bit is set, you'll have the gimbal lock telling you that. And it's again the same old bit, SCS, Verb 40, wait 10 seconds, back to CMC. You can get some glitches, of course, in the CDUs that are not the 90-degree bit. I mean, there's a possibility of it. And, just some words on that - if - if the - if it's a low angle bit set, I say less than 30 degrees, you - it really does not affect your target point. I mean, we're talking in the order of being very close to nominal, within a mile or so. If - if the bit set is large enough for you to see it, comparing the - I mean if the bit set is gonna affect your splashdown point by any appreciable amount, you'll see it comparing your commanded angle versus where the spacecraft is going. So, that's your clue. And, if you see this and it's not looking right, we want you to go to SCS, do a Verb 40, and back to CMC to see if that solves the problem.
Okay. That all sounds reasonable.
Okay. And I guess the - I guess this - about the only thing I'm saying, Ken, - that's any appreciable difference is this Verb 40 bit. I'm not used to doing that during the entry and I'd like to emphasize that if you're not - if it's looking funny and you're not sure, well, go ahead and do it. And, of course, as you well know, the needles will zero and the DAP will be off for 10 seconds, and you'll be back in business. There's one other point, and I'll admit this is - this stretching pretty - pretty thin, but we're trying to cover all the angles. If it's prior to P64, where you're going along - Of course, if you're in CMC control and you get a glitch, why you'll get the response from the DAP. If you're going along in SCS control and you get a glitch, why, your needles will go out. Now, you may have your pitch needle already pegged. So there's - here again, we might have a glitch in that pitch needle - in the pitch CDU and not know it. So, just one other recommendation is if your pitch needle doesn't come off the peg the way you like it, why, let's try a Verb 40 before we would say the - the G&N is not doing correctly.
Okay.
And I guess that about takes care of it, Ken, John, unless you got any - Charlie, unless you got any questions. It'd probably be John punching up the - the alarm there and, if you do get the 3777, why, let's reset it and press ahead. And, of course, any of the other triple-7 alarms are - are valid. And - but, of course, it's the same old monitoring bit. You're going to see how she goes.
Okay, Stu. I think that's all pretty well understood. Thank you very much.
Roger.
Yes, Stu. We appreciate it.
Okay.
You've got to spend a lot of time learning about CDUs, I expect, huh?
Hey, that's a favorite topic of discussion, now. CDUs and how do they glitch.
Houston, 16. Are we going to get another Entry PAD?
That's affirmative. About an hour from now.
Apollo 16. Our first batch of tracking data shows you right in the groove, and we're gonna get another hours' worth of data and then give you your final PAD.
Roger.
Okay, Houston, the EMS checks in Standby. Its pattern checked out okay.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, we're gonna maneuver to the entry attitude.
Roger.
Do you happen to have two stars to recommend to us? We got a 405 here.
Roger; we saw it, and FAO's working on it.
Ken, your current attitude is good for stars 15 and 21.
Thank you very much. Roger.
Roger.
Boy, that's a good platform, isn't it?
That's a beauty.
Okay, when you have the numbers, we'll torque.
Cleared to torque.
Okay. We're going to the horizon attitude check, Houston.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 16, Omni Charlie.
Roger; you have it.
Roger.
Okay, Hank. We're into the checklist down to standing by for the pri - glycol loop evap - evaporator activations.
Roger. Copy, Charlie.
Houston, the evaporators are up.
Roger; copy.
Hank, is - Are we okay with the Temp In valve in Manual? With this setting?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
If you'll give Accept, we'll send you a state vector and a Z PIPA bias update.
Okays. you have it.
Apollo 16, the computer's yours. And I've got your recovery information. The weather's good; 2000-foot scattered, 10 miles, wind's out of the east at 10 knots, 3-feet wave heights. Your recovery ship is Ticonderoga, and the aircraft is Recovery.
Roger; understand. Thank you much.
Houston, the pyro battery check is okay.
Roger; copy.
Houston, we're ready for the VHF check. Over.
Roger, John. We're going to have to wait a few minutes here to be - until we get in a little closer.
Okay. We're going to do the Command Module RCS activation, if that's okay.
Stand by one.
Okay; go ahead.
Roger.
Okay; here comes the Logic, On, Houston.
Roger.
Stand by, John. It will be a minute before we get data.
16, Houston. Would you take the Logics, Off, please, and then back On again?
Okay; they're going Off, and back On. They're Off now. They're On now; 1 is, 2 is.
Apollo 16, you're Go for Pyro Arm.
Roger. Okay; Pyro Arm A is Armed, and B is Armed.
Looks good.
Okay, we're pressurizing her now, Houston.
16, looks good down here.
There you go.
Apollo 16, Houston. If you'll bring up your VHF, Simplex A, we'll do a voice check with you about five minutes after we configure the ground.
It's up, Henry.
Okay.
Apollo 16, Houston. I have your final Entry PAD.
Go ahead, Hank.
Roger. MidPac 000, 153, 000; 290:06:31, 267; minus 00.71, minus 156.18; 07.1; 36196, 6.54; 1051.0, 36276; 290:23:31; 05g, 00:27; Noun 69, NA; DO, 4.00, 02:00; 00:16, 03:31, 07:46; boresight sextant stars, NA; lift vector, up; and there's only one change in the comments, Charlie. The RET for 90K - do you want me to read all those?
Just give me the RET.
Okay, RET 90K is 6:08.
Okay, the range is the same?
Roger. The other times and the other comments remain the same.
Okay, with the readback, Hank. MidPac; 000, 153, 000; 290:06:31, 267; minus 00.71, minus 156.18; 07.1; 36196, 6.54; 1051.0, 36276; 290:23:31; 00:27; Noun 69 is NA; 4.00, 02:00; 00:16, 03:31, 07:46; sextant and boresight are NA; lift vector is up. All the comments are the same except RET 90K is 6 plus 08 over.
Good readback, John.
Apollo 16, Houston. We'd like to get the Main Bus Ties on a little early, as we talked about.
Okay.
Okay, they're on, Henry.
Roger; thank you. They look good.
Apollo 16, Houston. Like to verify that you have the Left VHF Antenna.
Negative; we had the Right; we're on Left Antenna now.
Roger.
Apollo 16, Houston on VHF. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Hank.
Roger; reading you loud but a little noise.
Okay; we're checking out the Command Module thrusters now.
Roger. We're ready to go, John.
Okay.
RCS looks good down here, 16.
Okay, we can verify that we had all engines.
Apollo 16, Houston. We gonna have to give you another Z PIPA bias and we'd like for you not to go into P61 until we get that in.
Okay.
We're in - do you want us to go to Accept now?
Negative.
Apollo 16, Houston. If you'll give us Accept, we'll send up that Z PIPA bias.
You have it.
It appears that that PIPA's responding to temperature changes, is what the problem is, John.
Apollo 16, the computer's yours.
Okay, going to Block.
Set. Tape is running. Standing by for 289:58, Separation Checklist.
Think they've slipped.
Okay, they've given us this. Is there any reason why we shouldn't...
Houston, have you got the PIPA incorporated?
That's affirmative.
Okay, we're going to Block.
It is Block.
Okay. Well, let's go.
Okay, we're a few minutes out. CB ELS/CM-SM Sep, two, Close.
Circuit breaker.
Yeah. That's CM-SM SEP, one, two, Closed.
Primary Glycol To Rad, Bypass, Pull.
Want to do this early? We're about a minute.
We're about a minute up.
Glycol.
Bypass is pulled. Okay, now.
Repress Package, Fill, to 865. It already is; I just checked it. Then On.
Repress Package you want On.
Yeah.
Okay. Okay, it's On.
O2 Service Module Supply valve, Off.
Service Module Supply is Off.

Abort System Propellant, RCS Command; verify.
Yep.
Service Module RCS Secondary Propellant Fuel Pressure, four, Open.
Yeah.
Verify that.
Secondary
VHF AM A and B going off.
Okay, Hank; your VHF is off. I'm turning off the fuel pumps now.
Roger.
Off. It's right here.
Okay; yeah.
Glycol Temp In to Manual.
It is. It has been.
It has been.
Okay.
Okay, now let's put in that thing.
Glycol Temp In...
Okay, we do a Verb 25 Noun 7 Enter...
Enter.
Seven - 5...
Enter.
Enter; 1...
Enter; 0 Enter.
Go.
I thought it was after you called P61.
for.
Okay, we have knocked down the average g flag.
4.
Roger.
Okay, you want to call P61.
Let's see now; that's - we're 23 minutes to go. Think that's - think that's too much - too long for the integration?
What's it supposed to be, 18:30?
That's...
We're supposed to have a flashing 06 61 at 18:30.
Want to go at 20?
Yeah.
Okay, at 20, it'd be about 290:02, but make it 03.
Okay.
Well, we've got a...
We got three minutes...
Three minutes to go - four minutes, actually, John.
Yeah.
Okay (sigh).
Okay, Ken, when we hit the.05g time, I'll - I'll call.05g -time, mark, and remind you of the roll and the.05g switch.
All right, sir.
Okay?
Thank you.
Okay, now, down on the flashing 06 61, we got a Verb 21 Noun 46 has to be set.
Yes, sir.
Okay. That's after sep...
that's - Yeah, that's the next 06 61.
Yeah.
Okay, horizon check comes up at 290:06:30. Fifteen minutes.
That clock is off again.
Oh, let's call it up.
Okay; go.
Agh, we did kill that dang thing.
(Laughter) I wondered if you had enough courage to sit there; I'm not sure I did.
Well. Okay, let's check the numbers, Charlie.
Minus 000.71. That's good.
Yeah.
Minus 156.18. That's good.
Good.
And the heads down. That's good.
Pro.
Pro.
7.62g's.
Oh, shoot.
This says 7.1 on the PAD.
36188.
Okay, this says 36196.
Minus 6.68.
This says 6.54.
Okay.
Okay, that - this can change to the integration as you come around.
Yeah, we integrated out too far away.
Yeah. Go ahead...
Pro.
1071.
Okay, 1051. We'll take it.
It's close.
36272.
Twenty-one minutes to.05g; 23 24 - Yep, that all looks pretty - pretty reasonable. Shall we?
Yeah to separate.
Okay, at 17 minutes, that's 290:06:31 - three minutes from now.
Okay, but you probably ought to yaw about 45 degrees now anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah. Are you ready to do that now?
Okay, manual attitude...
You're looking good coming up on sep.
Manual Attitude, three, Rate Command.
I have three in Rate Command.
Att Dead Band, Min.
Dead Band's Min.
Rate, High.
Rate's High.
Spacecraft Control to SCS.
SCS.
Yaw 45 out.
Left?
Left.
Okay, my BMAGs are uncaged.
BMAGs, Att 1/Rate 2.
Yeah; not until I get out there.
Okay; yeah.
We should have a horizon check at 17 minutes also.
Okay. That really, I guess, should have been done before I yawed.
This is the same time as the yaw.
Yeah.
Same time as separation, exactly.
You can't see the horizon start.
Okay, yaw at 45 degrees out of plane.
Att 1/Rate 2.
I verify the Main Bus Ties are On.
Okay. Verify that the Glycol was pulled?
Okay, verify Glycol, Bypass?
That affirm.
EMS Mode to Standby, verify.
That's verified.
Okay, the CM RCS Logic, on, up.
CM RCS Logic is on.
Okay, we...
Turn up the lights.
Yes, sir. John...
The reason is because you can't see out once we...
Yeah.
in here.
Yeah. That's - that's a good plan.
Okay.
Now we've got 17 minutes. We're coming up - or on 17. We separate at 15, at 290:08:31. We'll hold off on the Logic until 17. Okay?
The Logic?
SECS Logic, two, on, up, verify.
That's verified.
Verified.
Okay. SECS Pyro ARM, two, to arm at 17. Okay?
Okay. And that's coming up in 10 seconds?
Ten seconds.
Okay.
Okay, SECS Pyro ARM, two, arm.
Two armed.
Okay, at 15, which is 290:08:31, we separate. CM/SM Sep, two, on.
This time, John, you can hit any switch up there.
(laughter).
Just that row.
Okay. Tell me when, Charlie,.
I will. We got a minute and a half.
Okay; we're a minute and a half to CM/SM Sep.
Okay, you got your hand controller locked, but it's armed.
Roger; copy.
It's locked.
Okay.
We got all the scissors down and everything, didn't we?
I sure hope so, Charlie (laughter).
Okay, nothing up in here that I see. No screwdrivers or anything - tools. Okay. Within a minute.
Should be a loud bang.
Man, will it ever.
Fifteen seconds, John.
Say when.
Okay.
3, 2, 1 -
Separate. There we go.
What's the Master for?
That's just - got to go to Caution and Warning.
Putting them in...
Separation, Houston.
Roger.
Man, it really went, didn't it? Manual Attitude, three, Min Impulse.
Yeah.
BMAGs, Rate 2.
Rate 2.
C&W mode, Command Module; RCS Transfer, Command Module...
Everything looks good from down here, 16.
Go.
CM RCS Logic, Off. Check...
CM RCS Logic is Off.
pressures. They're good.
Okay. Oh. How's the cabin pressure?
Great.
Okay.
Hanging in there. Batteries are looking good; they picked up all the load. Battery compartment's looking good.
I was sure proud to hear that big bang.
Me, too.
Okay, EMS - Yaw back to zero.
Going back.
Okay, the bu - bus voltages is hanging super - 28.
Boy, there's a lot of stuff out there.
Yaw back to ze - Okay?
I'm going back to zero, Charlie.
Pitch to entry attitude.
Okay, was I supposed to put EMS...
153.
Okay, was I supposed to put the EMS to - Normal yet? I mean...
Yeah. EMS data, verify?
It's 1051 and 36276.
EMS Function, Entry.
It's Entry.
EMS Mode -
Normal.
Normal.
Verify the filter down on.05g.
That's verified.
Okay, when you get to attitude, you can Pro to activate the entry ja - DAP.
Okay. No; wait a minute. We're not in attitude.
We got to pitch to 152.
Well, you can Pro on that anyhow. Where - where do we do our thing here?
Right here.
Between - between these two steps, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
Pro.
It's all right. I'm in SCS, so it's okay.
Okay, Verb 21.
Noun 46.
21, Noun 46.
Enter.
3000 Enter.
30,000.
30,000.
Okay. There you go. Enter.
Done.
Okay, Houston, we have the - we have the bit 3 set in the 21 46.
We're venting something.
Roger; and you're looking good.
We're venting something. Maybe it's the steam duct.
Yeah, the water - water boils...
I want to - going to the right and that thing - I looked up again and it turned around and went back to the left.
Okay, the water boiling it right back. Yeah. Very definitely.
Yeah, we're boiling.
I didn't remember anyone ever mentioning that. That isn't in the simulator.
That doesn't do it very much. Got to be very sensitive.
Okay, 153 on the attitude.
Yes, sir.
You there?
No, no. Keep going (laughter).
Okay. Checking them off.
Okay.
Keeping you honest.
That's fair.
I nev - I thought I'd see the Service Module out the side, but it's - never did see it.
You want a 06 22?
Say again?
You want the 06 22?
06 22.
When you do that, you get the CMC guidance.
Oh, oh.
The X-axis is beyond 45 degrees out of velocity vector.
I'll probably get that. Go ahead.
Didn't get it; P63.
Okay, we got P64 up and she's looking good...
63.
63.
63, I mean.
Roger. P63.
Scared.
Okay, how far are we from EI?
Okay, we're at...
Eight minutes?
No, we're at 11 minutes.
Eleven minutes.
And - about 11 minutes and 15 seconds.
The horizon will be about - Well, I've already missed the horizon. Okay.
Yeah. You can't tell with all those particles out there.
What? The horizon's out there?
It ain't lit.
No, the horizon's gonna be.
It ain't lit.
Well, when I find the Moon, I'm going to know where the horizon is. It'll be just below it.
What's pitch attitude, Ken?
We're about 210.
Okay.
Look - look at that, John. Look how fast that comes down.
Yeah, it - it.
You don't have to be too terribly sensitive to see that. That's the first place where the simulator hasn't been just like this thing.
Well, sometimes it - water boils and sometimes it don't.
(Laughter) Okay.
Okay, at - when we get to 06 64, FDAI Scale, 5/5.
Okay, I...
Okay.
I won't be there for a minute. I'll tell you when I get there.
Okay, fine.
You know, this is the first time we've had particles around us that color. Now I got some red ones and some yellow ones.
That's nice.
I knew you'd like that.
Yeah, I like that, baby.
It also takes the pitch out, but it's not as effective as the - the yaw.
Come on, baby, hang in there.
We've got a zillion particles.
Everything looking good so far.
Yeah.
I do like to hear those things go. Very nice feeling.
Six minutes away.
Six minutes?
About, yeah.
No.
Ten...
Ten, yeah.
Be nine minutes.
I've got it on f/11, Just what the checklist says.
Yeah.
Wh...
I was just thinking - I don't know why I didn't think of this before, but I bet you could get moonset on that thing. Give a little burst as the Moon goes down.
Okay. Okay, I'll set it to about 6 frames a second.
What - what's it normally on?
Twelve.
Twelve.
Hey, that's a nice red particle out there.
Yeah, there's a lot of color.
Want another antenna?
Houston, 16; our signal strength's down.
Houston, 16 - on another antenna.
Apollo 16, Houston. We're reading you.
Looks like your up-link's a little weak, Hank; we're down - we're getting a lot of scratchiness.
Roger; we're hearing the same thing.
It's ARIA is what it is.
It's - yeah - how about that? They work.
What works?
ARIA. That wasn't Hank.
Yeah, it was.
Roger, 16. We're coming through ARIA now.
Yeah, it was. That's Hank.
Really?
Yeah.
y'all have heard on ARIA.
Okay; you sounded pretty good then.
Seven g's.
(Laughter) It's going to feel it.
It's gonna hurt. It really is, I bet you.
Yep.
Try not to get any surprises. I guess - no one's ever talked about them coming down.
No.
Don't let any dust get in your eyes; there's a lot floating around here.
And, Apollo 16, Houston. We do not have telemetry.
Okay; we're looking good, Hank.
Roger.
(Laughter) We'll give you our status. I guess they can't get anything through ARIA.
Still don't see the Moon.
It won't show up until it - it's moving. It isn't, but we are - moving very rapidly in central angle now.
Yeah.
And when it comes, it's going to go down - it only takes like a second or two to set.
Don't know what...
Okay, we got the attitude yet?
Not quite,
what good that does you.
Oh, okay. That simple, I'd buy it.
3000 miles to go, gang; 33,971 feet a second, Charlie.
3000 miles to go?
Yep.
Gyah! We're hauling it. I'll tell you, babe, we're hauling it.
We're still accelerating.
Yeah, we're starting to pick up speed now.
You can feel it go faster.
Is that to touchdown...
I feel it...
or is that to EI?
I'm heavy.
Huh?
Is that 3000 miles to EI?
Touchdown...
That's 3000 miles to touchdown.
Oh.
SET is 290...
the last 3000 is the hardest. They don't say it. I just made it up.
I see. That's very good.
We don't want to come up with any more of those little things.
(Laughter) Yeah. I get the last 10,000 feet.
We there yet, Ken?
(Laughter) No.
Well, hurry up.
(Laughter) What have we got to do?
Well, you got five minutes.
Okay. I got 10 degrees.
Okay, good.
What are we going to do when we get here?
Just make me comfortable.
(Laughter)
(Laughter) Hang in there. 153 is the attitude.
Yes, sir.
That's the only thing I know this morning.
That's really all you've got to know.
We've got a couple of things to do, really; FDAI Scale and Rot Control Power.
Okay, Rot Control Power - what are you going to do with that? I got...
Direct, two, Main A/Main B.
Yeah, I did that before Sep.
Got data back and you're looking good.
Roger.
(Singing) Da-da-da-da.
Okay, wind my watch.
Yeah, I had to put that on my post sleep checklist because I never remember to wind it. I can't believe - program like this and you got to have a self - can't have a self-winding watch.
Digital manpower at work.
There's something basic about telling time that - seems to be very difficult. Okay, I'm at attitude, Charlie.
Okay. FDAI Scale, 5/5.
Okay, going to 5/5.
Okay. Now we just stay hanging in here - until.05g.
Okay, and I want to start my wristwatch at.05. I don't know what good that'll do me. I mean at RRT. I'll - I'll set this thing; it just might work. Maybe it'll be sympathetic. It did it on TEI, much to my amazement.
Okay, we got 3 minutes to RRT.
Now, the Moon's already set according to this.
No, 292 - Yeah, it is - too - I never saw it.
No, we weren't in attitude.
Okay.
We were in attitude for Entry, not for watching moonset.
Okay, I'm back to 12 frames a second, then.
Okay. Okay, all I've got to do is get these guys back to Rate Command and go to CMC, and I'll do that soon as we start to pick up a little aerodynamics.
Okay, we're about a minute out.
A minute -
A minute -
And a half.
And Entry in Normal?
Yes, sir.
Got both regs on the line?
Roger.
Pyros are armed.
Yep.
CM/SM Sep switch - circuit breakers are in.
Yep.
Think of anything else.
I got to get these.
Yeah. Yeah, okay; that's at.05g. You - you also.05g switch and EMS ROLL switch.
Okay.
Okay, and Spacecraft Control - SC MCC. You got four to get...
Apollo 16, Houston. You're still looking good.
Roger.
You're one minute out.
You might get a little this early because -
I think I'm starting to pick up some aero.
Yeah, they -
That's the horizon. Look at that.
Get back in the cockpit, Charlie.
Okay.
Okay, the needle's coming off the peg. That's doing good work.
Yeah, it's right on.
Okay.
Thirty seconds to RRT.
And call at RRT.
Okay; 15 seconds.
Watch it diverge there.
Mark; RRT. Watch is started.
Clock's running. Okay, I'm going to Rate Command.
And Spacecraft Control to CMC.
Better get it back; get that needle back.
Okay, we got some - glow...
Okay, get your. Look at the glow.
Give it.
It's got it. CMC has control.
Okay.
Okay. Hundredth of a g...
Camera's started.

Okay, we're subcirc.
Oh, yeah; are we?
Yeah; subcirc.
My watch is - my...
Comp for plus one.
Okay.
And roll.
Doing good work, machine. How's the...

How's the pressures?
and 11.7 -
Pressures are looking good in the RCS.
Twenty-five overshoot; 34 overshoot; comp for lift down; 74 degrees right; 75 degrees right.
Okay, I'll just copy it, John. No sweat; we are sitting right in here. Beautiful machine. EMS and G&N are converging. We're down to 2½g's.
(Coughing)
Plus 68; plus 69. Reversing roll.
Outstanding.
It went...
Good decision.
23 north; now it's going back south.
Okay, what time you got, Charlie?
I got three minutes -
Mark.
Okay.
We haven't entered blackout yet.
Yeah. Ahh.
03:31.
Outstanding!
Okay, the RCS pressures are looking good. They're at 3000...
27:02; we in blackout?
Minus 86...
It's gonna start pulling that range off.
Minus 84.
It's gonna pull another 4g's here pretty soon.
Gonna get another big g here, huh?
Yeah.
Minus 80.
Okay, we -
Minus 77; minus 76 -
Okay, we blackout right on time.
Okay.
Got signal strength.
Houston, we're out of the first blackout there.
Okay, the gs are going to be building up again.
Okay.
Minus 50...
