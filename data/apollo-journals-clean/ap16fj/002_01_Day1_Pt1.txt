Lift-Off.
Man, we're on our way!
Yaw program [garble, probably tower] clear.
Clear the tower.
Roger; clear the tower.
You go.
[Garble, probably Roll] program.
Go! You...
Roger roll. You have good thrust in all five.
Roger.
Pitch program. [Long pause.]
It sure ain't what I expected.
Me, neither. It's like a freight train.
That's what everyone said. Quiet as [garble].
Man, we're right on.
Man, look at this thing go! What are the g's, John?
One and a half.
Okay.
Through 10K [10,000 feet altitude, 3,000 metres]. Must be coming up on a little Q here.
Tower [sic] system's relieving - Tower's rel - cabin's relieving...
Stand by for Mode 1 Bravo...
Roger.
Mark. 1 Bravo.
1 Bravo.
Cabin's relieving.
You're feet wet now, [Apollo] 16.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Man, that was beauteous! [garble]...
[Garble] g.
Master Alarm.
Okay, that one's [garble]...
Okay, that's just [garble] module.
No sweat.
Okay. Okay.
Coming up on max Q, Charlie.
Okay.
Okay. Trajectory is good.
Two and a half gs.
Okay; you're through max Q, and everything looks good. [Pause.]
It does indeed. I believe this baby's gonna go up.
Stand by for Mode I Charlie.
Roger. We're [garble].
Mark. (Mode) I Charlie. [Pause.]
Okay. Manual.
Right
Ready?
Yeah.
Those are done.
EDS is manual. [Long pause.]
(onboard) And that - that baby is gonna unload.
It sure is.
Mm-hmm.
[Laughter.]
Stand by.
[Garble] inboard shutdown.
Roger; inboard. You're Go for staging. [Long pause.]
Right now, that [garble] only [garble] for staging. Watch it.
Okay.
All set.
I'm all set.
Okay, I'll count you down to it. 30, 31, [garble] 32. Those are good numbers, Ken?
That should be.
[Garble.]
Hey, yeah, there's [laughter] [garble].
Man!
Whoo!
Look at that.
Staging.
Oh, man.
Okay, ignition on the S-II.
Roger. [Pause.]
Boy, it's beautiful.
Is that [garble]?
Thrust is Go on all five on the S-II. [Long pause.]
Wasn't even showing that (laughter).
We got...
Okay, it's...
Comm's good.
Coming back - 3 minutes.
Mmm.
Nine, 10, 11, 12, [garble].
Want me to go on time, John?
Second plane Sep light's out. We'll go on time.
All right. I got the register...
Roger.
...set. Here we go.
Tower Jettison.
There she goes.
Roger. And we confirm your skirt Sep. You're Mode II now.
Roger. Mode II.
Okay, you're Mode II. Look...
Evaporators On? [Pause.]
Oh, Charlie, look at that horizon. Can you see...
Grab [garble].
Yeah.
Okay. Okay, what - how's the steering?
She's doing fine, John.
Yeah. 3.4.
Roger. Steering has converged. The CMC is Go.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Four minutes. We should be sitting at 21 degrees. [A flight angle of 21 degrees to the launch pad's horizontal.]
That is beautiful.
Man, I'll say...
You looking?
...[garble] there.
Okay.
You're right.
I'm going to look out a little bit.
Okay, we're only pulling three-quarters of a g.
[Garble.]
[Apollo] 16, Houston. Four minutes. Everything looks great down here.
Roger. It looks good up here, too.
Hey, Gordy, you ought to see that horizon. Just gorgeous.
Roger.
...[garble] that's [garble]?
Yeah.
Look at that stuff out your left window. What the heck is that?
That's just stuff from the tower.
Going with us?
Yeah.
04:30. Just a little low on the - the altitude. Velocity's looking good.
04:30. Steering is 19 degrees. Looking good.
Okay. Let's see - you got - How about let's clean up the rest of the things we didn't do, like attitude, the rate command.
Rate Command.
And Alpha to Pc.
Pc. Turn on our gimbal motors here at 6 minutes, Charlie.
Okay. I'm ready; about a minute to go.
Well, you even remembered the - you remembered to do the water, Charlie.
Yeah, I got the water and everything going.
We ought to give you an award for that.
Man, I was watching those gauges at S-IC and they were really jumping. That steam pressure the secondary read out. Man, was that a ride!
It was that staging that's thrilling, ain't it?
You ain't kidding! I was real glad someone warned us.
[Apollo]16, Houston. Times are nominal, level sense will be 8 plus 37, and cut-off at 9 plus 19.
Roger. [Long pause.]
You'll get a little buzz now.
Coming up on 6 minutes...
Stand by for S-IVB to COI capability.
Mark. You have it now.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, stand by. Go ahead on the Ones.
Pitch 1 is coming on...
Mark. Yaw 1. Did you get it?
No, I couldn't see it. Okay. Go ahead.
Pitch 1 is on...
Mark.
Okay.
Yaw 1 is on...
Mark.
Good.
Pitch 2 is on...
Mark.
Good one.
Yaw 2 is on...
Good one.
Okay.
Check your GPIs?
Yeah.
Okay. You can't see that on the fuel cells, Ken.
I just noticed that.
It's all on the batteries here.
Yeah. I saw that. That's really strange.
Yeah.
Okay. Got...
How's the trajectory?
Got a minute to go to inboard shutoff.
Man, it looks like a champ. [Garble] get Omni Delta.
Stand by for S-IVB to orbit.
Mark. You have it now.
Roger.
You got Omni Delta, Gordy?
Roger, Charlie. [Long pause.]
Inboard shutdown on time.
Roger; inboard. [Long pause.]
[Apollo] 16, at 8 minutes. Looking good here. [Pause.]
PU shift. [Pause.]
[Apollo] 16, Houston. We saw the PU shift. Thrust looks good, and you're Go for staging.
Roger. [Pause.]
You have level sense arm now.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Stand by for Mode IV capability.
Mark. You have Mode IV now.
Okay; there was S-II shutdown.
Roger.
And we have S-IVB ignition.
And your thrust looks good on the S-IVB.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Everything's in great shape up here, you guys.
Okay, we're gonna back this guy up, and we've got...
[Apollo] 16, Houston. You're Go for orbit. Predicted cut-off, 11 plus 49.
Roger; 11:49.
Okay, now, you're gonna shut this guy down with the hand controller if it overspeeds?
Yep. But we're going to see 20...
That's not for long.
...25.6.
That's right. We want - Let's see. 25.6 is normal, so we go to 25.7 to back it up.
Right.
Eleven minutes. Look at that. Minus 60, and it says it's gonna be 69. It's got a little buzz of its own.
Yeah.
Nm-Bmm. Here's another one. A little rumble.
Yeah. Same frequency.
Okay, it's 11:25...
11:20.
...11:20. Okay, 25.1, 25.2, 25.3. Look at it pitch back up and kill that altitude. 25.4...
Should have about l0 seconds - to shutdown.
l, 2, 3, - 5.5.
Shutdown.
Look at that [garble]...
SECO [S-IVB Engine Cut-Off].
Rog.
Right on! [Long pause.]
Oh, [garble]...
Look at [garble].
Here we are!
I'm turning off the pyro arms, you guys.
Okay. Gimbal Motors. Let's go, Gimbal Motors.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Pitch 1 is coming Off.
Okay, go.
Yaw 1 is coming Off.
Roger. [Long pause.]
[Apollo] 16, Houston. The range safety system is safe. The orbit is Go.
Roger. Boy, it's just beautiful up here, looking out the window. It's just really fantastic. And the thing worked like a gem.
Sure did. We copy Noun 62, and your orbit by radar is 95 by 90 [nautical miles, 176 by 167 km]. [Long pause.]
[Apollo] 16, Houston. The booster looks good. It's reconfigured for orbit. [Long pause.]
[Apollo] 16, Houston. The Z-torquing angle will be plus 0.06. Over.
Plus - Roger. Plus 0.06.
That's correct. [Long pause.]
...[garble] breaker and install the COAS. Okay, we just...
... O2 .
That's okay. I just pushed the breaker in.
Okay.
Okay, Gordy; we're on page 2-11 [of the Launch Checklist] down through - We're getting to installing the COAS. That MA (Master Alarm) was the Transducer, ECS.
Roger, Charlie.
Oh, look how easy it is! Okay, Service Module...
Charlie, did you do that?
Yeah, I did that, but I'm sorry (laughter). Okay, Waste H2O/Dump; Fuel Cell's going Normal; Purge Line Heater's on.
(Laughter) Did you...
Look at those - little...
Yeah, you...
Let's see, [garble] got the torquing angles. You got...
And I made it up with a clean window.
Sure. Yeah.
Whoops. MA (Master Alarm) again.
No, I'm testing.
Yeah?
Yeah. Okay, going to Command Module...
But you...
...you get an MA [Master Alarm]?
Yeah.
Listen to that tone. Barely audible.
Yeah.
Shoot. I don't have any trouble hearing it. Hatch Gear Box is Latch; Actuator Handle is going to neutral [garble]...
Oh, John...
Excuse me there, Charlie.
I'm gonna leave the nitrogen in the - in the hatch. We're gonna pump that when we get back. I talked to the guys about that.
Okay.
They said that'd be okay.
Fine.
Okay, and I've got a note in the Flight Plan that says we're to vent it later on.
Okay, we just had loss of comm.
Apollo 16, Houston. [Long pause.]
Okay. Ohhh.
Ohhh. Is that ever nice! Look at that [garble]...
Look at that view out there, you guys!
(Laughter)
Oh, is that ever pretty.
Hey, it's b - blacker than pitch out this window five.
Supposed to be, Charlie. That's the rule of it.
[Garble.] Yeah.
Okay, I got your Verb 83 up there. I don't know what you're gonna do with it. I [garble] just buy it for you.
That really is nice, that Verb 83 (laughter).
Okay, I'm gonna start in on the...
Okay, I've got eight grays. That all looks like a champ. Okay, cabin pressure's good.
If you'll get me a camera, I'll take a nice picture.
I'll go get those in just a minute, babe.
Okay.
It looks like those clouds are right on top - right down there. You could reach out and touch them.
They are. We're coming up over the Africa, Charlie, and...
Where's Africa? I don't see it.
Well...
Is it - maybe I can just look...
This is just - these little old - It's clouds like this or like it...
Apollo 16 through Canaries. How do you read?
Okay, you're 5 by, Gordy.
Okay; we're noticing a possible blockage in the primary coolant loop. Would you have John check the Glycol Reservoir Bypass valve to be sure it's Open?
Roger. [Garble].
Hey, Gordy, do you want us to go ahead and - and - put the radiators on?
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Charlie, this is Houston. Whatever you just did up there got the coolant loop flow back. We'd like to watch it for a minute before proceeding. Over.
Okay, we're at step 12, page 2-13, configuration now with radiators at bypass. We've got the - the Reservoir Bypass Open, and the Outlet and the Inlet [valves] Closed.
Okay, let me tell you what it was, Gordon, I think, is the - the Outlet [valve] was - was accidentally Open, probably at - at some other time, and the - the Bypass [valve] was Closed and the Inlet [valve] was - was Open. That's probably been the indications you were seeing.
Roger. Understand. [Pause.]
We're coming up over Africa now, Gordon, and it really is a spectacular view.
Roger. I wish I was there with you.
I guess we're - we're just over the Canaries looking down at those little islands, and that sure is something. [Long pause.]
16, Houston. You can proceed with the rest of the normal ECS configuration.
Roger. That's in work. [Long pause.]
16, Houston. We're having a - kind of intermittent data down here due to a problem with Canaries antenna. [Long pause.]
Okay, we're gonna put the glycol to the res - to the radiators now.
Roger.
Okay, I'm going to unhook and stow - unstow the helmet bags.
Hang on a second. Let me get that circuit breaker for you.
[Apollo] 16, Houston. Data is back now good, and everything looks fine as we come up 20 seconds to LOS (Loss Of Signal). We'll see you at Carnarvon at 52:39.
Roger; 52:39, Gordon.
Enjoy the view there.
All right. We're just starting to come into darkness now, and the sunset is...
Look - look at that. Look out there...
...just as beautiful as always in this space business.
[Laughter.]
Roger.
