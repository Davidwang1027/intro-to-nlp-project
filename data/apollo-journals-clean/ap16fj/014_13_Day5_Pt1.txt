How you down there this morning, Houston?
Charging hard.
Okay. Can we hold off on the SIM bay status? And I'll copy your three short items.
Okay, Don.
Okay, Don. Number one, I understand your comment about the potassium low and all that jazz. We've just finished up breakfast, and I think we've eaten almost everything that the LMies have to eat. And we - we've been drinking all the drinks every day. And, if we get a chance, well we'll try to get some more - get another juice bag out. We will terminate the Battery B charge and terminate the Jet Monitor, and I understand the way to do the Jet Monitor is - I'll go to - I'll go to the SCS mode and key a Verb 37 Noun 20 and then verify that Noun 26 is all zeros again. And I can go back to P20. is that correct?
Okay. I can just call 37 20 without getting any firings?
Don, I can't get to the Updates Book where that's written down. Would you read it to me slowly, and I'll do that terminate right now.
Okay. And we've - we're taking an extra orange with potassium this morning.
Houston, 16. Take a look at that biomed off of me and see how it looks. Over.
I got it reset - from yesterday.
Well, it's not loose.
Okay. This is John, and the sensors are fixed.
Gee, we're doing that. It sure looks like it's all tight.
Okay. I did that last night.
Here you go.
Want to change with me now?
Share the drink.
Okay. I'm not gonna make you drink it.
You want yours, Charlie?
There you are.
I got a.
Okay.
to the very cold.
Okay, we're eating.
Okay, have you got all the - got all the bags filled with tools and all that stuff?
Yeah, we're...
You got the pills down there, Charlie?
Sure right there.
16, this is Houston. Standing by.
Hello, Jim.
Morning.
We're in the process of a little suit donning here, and we've got one problem. When I went to retract the mass spectrometer, and the gamma ray boom came in fine, but the mass spectrometer boom indicates barber pole and has stayed barber pole about ten minutes. I went ahead and enabled the jets. And I'd like for you to take a look at the - at the - telemetry talkback on the boom, and see if you can suggest something for me to do.
Okay, we copy.
Barber pole. It's a total barber pole.
We copy, Ken.
Okay.
16, this is Houston. We're wondering if you've gone through the malfunction procedure for that Boom Retraction on page 1-24 of the Systems Handbook?
Well, I looked and didn't find one that was appropriate.
Okay. I guess you're right, Ken.
We're pretty busy, as you knows Jim: and so I'd really appreciate it if you could talk me through whatever steps you want.
Okay; understand.
16, this is Houston. We'd like you to put the Mass Spec Boom switch to the Off position. That's if it's not there already.
Okay. And when I do, it goes to gray.
Understand, it goes to gray.
That's affirmative.
16, this is Houston. We had understood that you had activated all your RCS jets. We show you still in the SIM bay configuration.
Okay. Thank you. I have the switches with the circuit breakers I had left out.
Roger.
16, this is Houston. You can go normal acquisition procedures on the S-band.
Okay.
Jim, what did you want me to do with that High Gain?
We wanted you to go through normal acquisition procedures.
16, will you go Auto on the High Gain?
You have it.
Okay.
Six - Never mind.
Okay, 16. This is Houston. We have SIM bay data now. Will you go back to Retract on the - on the Boom switch?
Okay. You have Retract, Jim.
Roger.
16, this is Houston. Will you check the talkback on that boom, and tell us whether it's full barber pole or a partial?
It's the same as it's been, Jim. It's a barber pole, full.
Okays we copy; a full barber pole. We show it partially retracted within acceptable limits.
What do you mean partially retracted? Does that mean your telemetry point has cinched closure?
That's affirmative.
Okay, then I'll put it back into the Off position?
Stand by, Ken. I think we - we want it in Retract.
Okay, I'll leave it in Retract.
Okay, you could put the Retract switch back to the Off position.
Okay, Retract is Off.
Roger.
If you can watch that thing on telemetry, I can extend it enough to clear it and then try a Retract again.
Okay, let's - We're within limits, Ken. Let's hold what we have.
Okay.
Okay, Jim. On the docking latch number 10, I've got some observations, if you're ready.
Roger. We're ready, Ken. Go ahead.
Okay, when I look in under the LM umbilical connector cover, the roller cam looks normal, and everything I can see from that side looks correct. When I look under the cover on the right side - that's the probe connector cover - I look at the bungee in the - the little arm that sticks out from the bottom of the cam - when I compare it to another latch, it doesn't stick out as far; in fact, the back of this part - this inner piece of the bell crank - I can get the part number on it, and it's - it's flush; whereas, on the other end, it sticks out and it shows the pin; so it looks like it hasn't come over center. Sorry I don't have the right part nomenclature.
Roger; we copy.
If you had a docking latch on the table there, somewhere, you could see what I'm looking at.
Ken, this is Houston. Can you see anything that might be obstructing or interfering with that cam action?
No, sir; I can't.
Okay.
Okay, 16; this is Houston. if you go to P00 and Accept, we'll uplink you. Okay, just Accept.
You're there.
Okay, 16; this is Houston. You can go back to Block.
16, this is Houston. Did you copy?
Yeah, you got it.
Roger.
Houston, we just passed over the good landing site, and you can see the whole area. Stands out very nicely just like the model.
Very good, Ken. Thank you.
Houston, from my present position I can't be sure exactly where I am because I just looked out the window again but - we passed over a large crater, and it has three little domes in the bottom of it with craters in the top of them; and they look like very subtle cinder cones. I'll try to mark that guy on the way back. It's one of a cluster of two large ones and several smaller ones.
Roger. We copy, Ken.
16, this is - Houston. Will you give us another reading on that docking tunnel index when you have an opportunity?
It's still the same thing: minus 3.5.
Roger. Minus 3.5.
Affirm.
16, this is Houston...
Houston, 16.
We assume the - Go ahead, 16.
Okay. John and Charlie got their suits on and they're in the LM. Is there any reason they shouldn't go ahead and power up and get some cooling?
Stand by.
Okay, let's proceed, Ken.
Okay, we'll proceed.
Houston; Orion on internal power at 93:07.
Roger.
And, Ken, this is Houston. The reason for that undervoltage last night was that the - all the heaters just happened to come on at that particular time.
Say again, Jim. We were cycling over to relief valve at the time.
I'll talk to you later.
Okay. Did you get my call on the LM power at 93:07?
Sure did; 93:07.
16, this is Houston. S-Band Aux Sci switched to Off. Over.
That's Off.
Roger.
Houston, can I give you some torquing angles, or did you copy them?
We have them, Ken.
Okay, and we're in the maneuver.
Roger.
Ken, this is Houston. Our plan on the mass spec boom is to leave it where it is, and we're going to ask John and Charlie to check it after undocking, with respect to position.
Okay.
And when I was trying to talk to you before, I just wanted to give you the words on that undervoltage which y'all had last night. The reason for that was the fact that all the heaters came on at the same time. Over.
Okay, I guess maybe I jumped the gun, but it seemed to me like that - that Master Alarm came on instantly when I hit that switch, and it seemed like the only prudent thing to do was to undo what I just did. I'm glad to hear that, though. Thank you.
And, Ken, if you're - got a few minutes there - I could give you a Flight Plan update, a very short one.
Could - could you hold it? I'm in the middle of - suit donning and canister change.
Okay.
Ken, will you have Orion select the aft antenna?
Okay, Jim. You got it.
Very good. We're reading you loud and clear.
And you're really beautiful, too. We are on Page 3-6, Step 6. We'd have been a little bit further along, but we had trouble with John's zipper today.
I tried to.
Orion, will you go Down Voice Backup?
Casper, over. Okay.
Casper, this is Houston. If there's anyth - anything significant from Orion, will you relay, because there is excessive noise down here.
How do you read, Jim?
Casper, this is Houston. How do you read?
Orion, this is Houston. How do you read?
You're five by, Jim. How me?
Roger; we're reading you. We still got a lot of noise, but we don't have the big dish up yet.
Okay, we got a signal strength of about 3.9 on the Aft Omni.
Roger. Understand 3.9 on the Aft Omni.
Noisy, ain't it?
Just a minute.
16, this is Houston. You're two minutes, LOS.
Okay, thank you. You got it.
Can you read me, Charlie?
Yeah.
I don't read you.
You don't have your audio breaker in, do you?
Yeah.
Did you turn on your stuff?
Yeah.
How's that? How's that?
That's better. Okay. Thank you. What was that? How did you fix that?
I just put my mike closer to my mouth.
Okay, fine..
And talked up a little bit. I've got my Master Volume up full.
Me, too.
Okay, where are you at, Charlie?
How do you read, Ken?
Loud and clear.
Wow. You're just super also.
Well, at least we got one improvement over the simulators.
Boy, I'll say.
Okay. That's really good.
Outstanding.
Okay. Go...
How about a - you need a 16 65 before I get away from here, John?
No, I - no, I - Tell him no.
No.
I can hear him - I can hear him through your headset.
Go B to Receive and - and then VHF A to T/R.
Okay. Okay. What's those numbers again?
36673 -
That's the LM weight?
Yeah. And 39329.
We're through with the LM umbilicals, I hope.
Yes, sir.
There's a lot of up here.
Man, this zero gravity is so neat.
I think it's almost as easy to it was designed Yes, sir. I'm gonna count them at least a dozen Yeah. I'll stow them.
Yeah. You take the umbilicals onto your side? That's new, huh?
Okay. On my checklist, it says verify them stowed.
Huh? Okay.
It says both electrical umbilicals removed. Drogue - Oh, yeah. It does say remove them.
Yeah. We don't want to - we don't want to leave these up here.... get in the way.
Hey, Ken?
If you get into Min Dead Band Attitude hold, I can go ahead and do this coarse align.
Huh? What?
Wait - Wait a - No, wait a minute. Let - you can't do it without his numbers. And he's doing the tunnel stuff now.
Okay.
He wanted you to go - to do the coarse align, but let's do the tun - whatever you think's faster.
Yeah, we're - The only way we'll keep from screwing up is to follow the checklist. Which comes after - comes after the tunnel. Wait a minute. After what? No, sir. I got a coarse align that comes 40 minutes after probe and drogue. If I get out of sync, I'm going to make you run the Well, you're way ahead of your time line, and I'm just barely hanging on.
coarse alignment.
Okay, go ahead. I just didn't see that. Ours just has us at - way ahead of that.
Oh, I see what - Okay, you're right. All I'm supposed to do is verify this stuff. Let him get that end, John. We - we're in Fat City. Man, I'm putting a lot of load on this suit in the back...
It's all zipped.
when I straighten my legs up.
Hey, I don't get much feedback in my mikes. I thought I'd be able to hear myself.
You know what we need is some orange juice things over here - drinks.
We got some.
Do we?
Uh-huh.
That water's not leaking, is it?
No. It's not.
Putting all this stuff in here. Trying to put the food on and then do food.
Looks great.
Okay. Let's start on the business. You say put the probe in, huh? I'll probe and drogue probe and drogue.
I could do the landing gear deploy. You want to do that?
Yeah, that sounds all right to me. They don't have to see that.
Okay. Tell Ken we're gonna deploy the landing gear.
Hey, Ken. If you hear a thump, we're gonna deploy the landing gear.
Yeah. Okay.
Okay. Circuit Breaker 11...
What page are you on?
It's on Page 1 - 3-17.
Okay.
Circuit Breaker 11, ED Landing Gear Flag, Close.
Okay, Logic Power A, Open.
Logic Power A is Open.
Master Arm, On.
Master Arm is coming On. System B light.
Okay. Landing Gear Gear Deploys Fire.
Landing Gear Deploy, Fire.
There they go.
Holy smoke!
Got a- a -
No doubt in my mind. You get a gray?
Gray.
Okay. ED 11, Logic Power A, Close.
Logic Power A is closed.
System A light, On.
It is.
Fire again.
Fire again, huh? Landing Gear Deploy, Fire again.
Hey, it's out, John! I can see the front footpad.
Okay, and then what?
And then look at the front footpad. Master Arm, Off.
Okay.
CB 11, ED Logic Power...
Landing Gear Flag, open.
Yeah, Landing Gear Flag. Man, have we got the condensation in here. Looks like you're serious about this.
Okay. You got the - you got some - three capture latches in there? All righty.
Yeah, they look okay.
Hey, you - Is this your pair of scissors here, Charlie?
In there, yeah.
Did you take them out of here?
I took them out of the data card kit.
Okay.
Last chance to swap seats, Charlie. I got my LOG all ready.
Man, this - this water cooling is so nice, Ken.
Okay, we've done that.
Are you in Auto on the Quads? No. Okay. Going to Auto on the Quads, Charlie.
Okay.
That was at 94:02 - 02:57.
Check the quad temps.
Super. They're already up there, ain't they?
Yeah, I push - those breakers on your side are...
Man...
manual. I mean they're - they cycle on and off by themselves.
Hey, let's get the AOT reticule thing out and put it on.
Oh. I forgot that. That's part of the housekeeping.
Yeah.
I wonder how I forgot that?
Is it in there?
Yeah, here it is.
Okay, you got it.
What are you, a southpaw?
I'd look out the - yeah, I'll look out the other way.
Beautiful.
What's your problem?
Okay, Charlie.
It's not in here.
What's not?
That AOT thing.
What AOT thing?
During the housekeeping.
Don't worry about it, Charlie.
I know it. I just wanted to write it down for the 17 guys.
Oh.
My ears have cleared up, John. I mean my sinuses.
Mine, too. You know why?
Why?
With as much simulator time as we got... What's the matter, Ken?
You got three capture latches.
Yeah. And it's tight. I can't budge it. You know, I wish I could cut my microphone off on my left side. That way I wouldn't get this drink bag squa - squirted in my face every time.
Pretty exciting, isn't it? me another shot of water, Charlie.
Okay (laughter).
That's good. That's enough.
Come on. Let's chill it down a little bit.
Oh. Think that's enough?
Umm, that feels good.
A-choo.
Oh, boy.
Can't understand why we're down to 91 percent on the Descent O2. Both tanks.
They didn't fill them.
You don't think so?
Yeah.
They never told me they weren't going to.
That may be what it reads.
13 minutes to AOS. Or thereabouts.
Is Ken pulling latches?
Hey, Ken.
Yeah.
You all finished? I'm gonna close the hatch.
Wait a minute.
Okay.
Is he off comm?
I don't know.
Don't close the hatch until he gets on comm.
This zero gravity is so neat.
Hey, Ken.
Okay. I've checked the exterior. The capture latches are engaged and locked, I got three good ones. And from my side, they're removed, the lock lever's engaged and flush; so we're all set.
Can you hear me on the comm, Ken?
Yeah, loud and clear.
Okay.
Yeah, it is, T.K. If you go to Min Deadband Attitude hold and give me a 06 20, I'd appreciate it.
Okay. I'll get with it right now.
Okay, Ken. I'm gonna close the hatch. We'll see you in 3 days, babe.
Okay.
And don't run off and leave us.
You want me to check and see if it's sealed? Want me to check the seal and see if there's anything in it before you close it? There was nothing in it, huh?
Huh-uh.
Got it, huh?
Uh-huh. Going Auto, Press Reg A A -
Okay, John. I'm in Min Dead Band.
Okay. And give me an 06 20.
Okay. Plus 002.74, plus 109.36, plus 004.57.
Okay. Okay. Plus zero - plus 002.74, plus 109.36, plus 004.57.
That's affirmative.
Did you get the docking angle written down, John?
It's minus 3-1/2.
Yeah. Just like in the training units. These -
What?
These helmet - these helmet bags, the plate - the - the snap caved in over here and you can't get it snapped.
There. Okay, Charlie. If you got some time, I'd like for you to check me on these angles.
Okay, just a minute.
Hey, Ken. You've got to stay in Min Dead Band Att hold until I tell you.
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.
Charlie, you gonna put your foot on the...
The hatch?
Yeah. (Laughter)
Plus 002.74, huh?
Yeah...
Minus - subtract that. That'll be 6 - that one's correct. 289.36. That one is correct. This is wrong here. 360 minus should be a 370 something.
You got 340 - Yeah, that's a minus.
356.
356, yeah. (Laughter) 356...
No, it's 355.43.
355.43.
Now add that up again and make sure it makes 360.
Yeah. Seven and three is ten; five and four is 9, ten, five and four is nine, 101 there we go.
Okay. Okay. Closed and secured hatch.
Plus 293.76 Enter, plus 289.36 Enter, plus 355.43.
You did the self-test already, huh, John?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Okay. Plus 293.76, plus 289.36, plus 355.43. Go. Go get them, tiger. Okay.
Should be 0, 284, and 060.
Yeah, you - he - he was out of attitude, wasn't he?
Oh, that's right. Yeah.
Okay. Verb 40 Noun 20.
Maybe you ought to wait until that No Att light goes out.
It ain't gonna ever go out.
Oh, that's right. You got to release. You're right. Not until you do that, it won't go out.
Now, they said they're gonna change the REFSMMAT, right?
Why, what do you want to do?
You can still set the REFSMMAT flag.
Yeah, I don't see why not.
Okay. Noun 07 Enter.
Enter, 77 Enter, 10000 Enter, 1 Enter.
Did you - did you check that REFSMMAT?
No. I'll check it in a second.
Okay.
It's set.
Okay.
Okay, Ken. I need an 06 20. On my - on my mark.
Okay. Standing by.
3, 2, 1...
Mark.
Okay. 94:20:20.
002.69, plus 109.31, plus 004.72.
Plus 002.69, plus 109.31, plus 004.72.
That's affirmative.
You read out - read mine to me, John.
294.65, 289.96, 355.02.
Okay. I got it. All down in here.
Okay. What time was it, Charlie?
94:20:20.
Should have AOS momentarily. You've done the landing gear. Did the DAP.
What else can we do, Charlie?
Nothing. Let's just wait until we get AOS and get the comm up. Then we do the E-memory dump.
Okay.
We got to get an up-link. Then we can start into the RCS, after I get the Ascent Bats checked out.
Ken, are we pretty close to being at the undocking attitude?
Undocking attitude is 01 plus 40.
Yeah, we're pretty close.
Okay.
What time did they say AOS was, Ken?
The reason I ask, Ken, is for this P52, I need to be close to the right attitude to pick up the stars.
It's the same set of timeline procedures we've been using.
I know it. It's just that it's further off on the 8-ball than normal.
Is that gonna be close enough, John?
Yeah. I think...
Oh, let's try it and see what happens.
Okay. We just got them.
Charlie, AOS any second.
