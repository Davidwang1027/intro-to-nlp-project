Okay, Houston. We're up to 2.1 on the LM/CM Delta-P gauge now.
Roger. Copy 2.1. [Pause.] And while I'm talking to you on this oxygen-tank pressure gauge, it's starting to look like there's a bias in there of about 14.7 [psi - 101 kilopascals] due to the fact that the reference chamber has apparently leaked its 1 atmosphere reference value down to probably vacuum. And that, coupled with a 5-psi [35 kilopascals] meter bias, should give you a total bias of about 20 psi [138 kilopascals] on the oxygen-tank pressure. But the gauge seems to be working okay except for that bias, so we're going to continue to follow it so we can give you a - maybe a better number prior to LOI. [Long pause.]
Thank you, Pete.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Houston, 16. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, Pete. I just took my window shade out of my rendezvous window and, looking out at Quad 1 of old Orion, the thermal shield that sits directly inboard of the - the - of the - of the quad - it's facing the plus-Z direction. It's a little piece about three feet long by about a foot wide [0.3 by 0.9 metres]; it's beginning to peel off also, now. Over.
It's doing the same thing as the - as the panel we were - we looked at last night, huh?
That's affirm, except for - It - it's not nearly as bad, and it's just primarily on the inboard side, but it is beginning to get the shredded wheat appearance like the other one. Over.
Roger. Understand. [Long pause.]
Pete, on the outboard side [clears throat] right out near the quad - or right above the quad - on that same panel, it - it seems to me it's beginning - it looks like it starts out with a very fine, shaggy-grass-type stuff, and then slowly peels up into the shredded-wheat type. Over.
Roger. Understand.
16, Houston. When you get a minute, we've got a - an addition to the Flight Plan at 32:48. [Long pause.]
Roger. Go ahead with your 32:48 addition.
Okay. We want to add a note to read the LM/CM Delta-P. [Pause.]
And we want to get that prior to that CM/LM pressure equalization decal. [Pause.]
Okey dokey. [Pause.]
And, Ken, that - we've made an ink correction on the back of that AOS/LOS Sun-wheel aid there. When you getting around to digging that out, I can give it to you, or I can pick it up later. [Pause.]
Ken's busy right now. Say again. Over.
Okay, on the back of the Sun wheel - the AOS/LOS Sun wheel - we've entered an ink note to account for the fact that we change REFSSMAT in the middle of his work there. We made an error on it. We've got to change the note now, and sometime when he's got that wheel out, I can read him up the correction.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. We're maneuvering to the attitude.
Roger.
Okay, Houston, we got 2.7 [psi] on the tunnel vent right now.
Roger; copy 2.7...
I mean CM Delta-P.
Roger; LM/CM Delta-P...
On the LM/CM Delta-P. [Pause.]
Okay, we copy. [Long pause.]
[Garble.] [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston, we're going to come on with the direct O2 and pump up the cabin.
Roger.
How does that look, Houston? Is that about 5.7 [psi - 39.3 kilopascals] to you?
We're showing about 5.5, John.
Okay. [Pause.]
John, they say that's good enough now.
Okay, Direct O2 is going Closed.
Roger. [Long pause.]
And the LM/CM Delta-P is 3.3.
Roger; stand by a minute.
16, we want to continue LM venting until you have a reading - Delta-P reading of 3.4 [psi - 23 kilopascals] on the meter, and that should take less than ten minutes. [Pause.]
Okay, we copy. We'll go to 3.4. [Long pause.]
Okay, we're in LM Vent.
Roger.
Okay, Houston, it's an honest 3.4.
Roger; copy. [Pause.]
Are we cleared to proceed? Over.
Rog, clear.
Okey dokey.
Okay, Houston, we're about ready to remove the hatch.
Roger.
[Faint.] Charlie's floating on over there now.
Houston, Charlie's floating on over to the Lunar Module now - to check on old Orion.
Okay.
Houston, that docking tunnel index, minus 3.5.
Minus 3.5.
Houston, Casper.
Go ahead, Casper.
Rog, Don. Did you guys get the tunnel index? [Pause.]
We've got it, Ken.
Okay. [Pause.]
And, Don, I'm holding off on the oxygen heaters. I'm keeping them all three in Auto until we get the surge and repress tanks built back up. That okay? If you would like for me to turn them off, I can reconfigure now; otherwise, I would like you to help me remember not to leave them on.
Roger, we concur, Ken. [Pause.] We'll remind you.
Okay, thank you.
Hey, Don, can I talk to you about the docking latch?
Roger. [Pause.]
You all set, or do you want me to wait a minute?
No, go ahead.
Okay, you remember we told you at the time we - that we docked that we had a Number 10 [latch] that didn't look like it had stroked quite the same as the others; but the lock was over the - over the rail.
Right.
You weren't on board at the time, that's right, we were talking to Gordy...
Right.
But that's one of the things we reported and the plate that goes over the bungee fairing is cocked slightly. And now that we've got everything cleaned out of the tunnel, I can look in here. It's real obvious that the bungee hasn't fired completely. It's down; the top of the bungee is recessed about a half of an inch down. It looks like it just hadn't triggered and, as a matter of fact, I'm looking at the latch and, by golly, I can see between the latch and the total ring, so it didn't even pull down against that. And I really obviously don't have any concern for it; except I'm - I've never seen one that looked just like this and I was gonna go ahead and recock it and fire it again and see how that worked with a manual trigger. But I got to thinking maybe that's - maybe it's best to let you folks think about it. The main thing I want to do is make sure it's not a problem in unlatching it when the time comes.
Roger; stand by.
Casper, we capt - we got all the data we need and we're going to take a look at it. We do not want you to recock and fire the thing manually and we'll get back to you later.
Okay.
And, Houston, Casper turned over the power supply to Orion at 33:58. [Pause.]
Roger, Casper.
Orion, how do you read Casper on VHF Alpha?
Man, you're just super on VHF Alpha. How me?
Man, that's good stuff, isn't it?
Just beautiful.
You're just as clear as you can be.
Okay. Go. [Pause.] Go. Go. [Pause.] Go. Go.
Hey, Ken; B Simplex. [Long pause.]
Orion, Casper on Bravo Simplex.
Okay, I'm reading you 5 by, Casper. How me?
Loud and clear.
You're super. [Pause.]
Houston, how do you read Orion? Over.
You're loud and clear, Orion.
Okay, we're coming down Downvoice Backup and - on a hot mike, and you're loud and clear to us. Over.
Roger.
Okay, how does the Low Bit Rate look to you, Pete?
Looks good, Orion.
Okay, I'm going up Bit Rate to High. [Pause.] Okay, how do you read now, Pete?
Loud and clear.
Okay, you're 5 by also. You got High Bit Rate. [Pause.]
Looks good, John.
Okay, we're going Biomed, Right. How do you read now, Pete?
Loud and clear.
Okay. [Pause.] You want to - we can - we're down to step 5 on page 1-118 - 1-18. Do you want to look at the High Bit Rate some more? [Long pause.]
Telemetry is Lo; perform voice and low-bit-rate check.
Okay. Do you want to - we can - we're down to step - 5 on page 1-118 - 1-18. Do you want to look at the bit rates some more?
Negative. We don't want to look at it anymore.
You do not. Rog. We're going to Low Bit Rate. [Pause.] Okay, the book says "Perform voice and low bit rate check with MSFN." How do you read?
Loud and clear.
Same-o. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. Our Function - S-Band Function is in Voice now. How do you read?
Houston, how do you read with the Function in Voice? Over.
You're loud and clear.
Okay, you're 5 by and Low Bit Rate. How does it look? [Pause.]
Low Bit Rate looks good.
How do you...
Okay, we're going to High Bit Rate. And we'll do the same thing with you - voice check and high bit rate check. [Long pause.]
Houston, how do you read - now? Over.
You're loud and clear.
Okay, give me a short count please, Pete.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Rog; you're very good. Okay, we're going to - Bit Rate is going Low, and we're going S-Band Range to Ranging.
Roger.
Okay, how do you read now? Over.
Loud and clear.
Okay, how is the ranging check going?
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Ranging looks good, Orion. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston, our ED bats are both Go at 37 volts and the sequence camera works.
Roger; copy. [Pause.]
And John's OPS was 5800 and mine was 6000. Over.
Roger.
Okay. As far as we're concerned, the comm is just super, and we're ready to go on to page 1-20 and deactivate, if you guys are. [Pause.]
Stand by 1, Orion. [Long pause.]
Okay, Orion. You can deactivate.
Okay, deactivating.
Okay, Houston. Casper has the LM power back at 34:19.
Roger; 34:19.
Affirm.
Hey, Don, if anyone wonders what I'm doing with 52, I just wanted to use Auto Optics to point at Jupiter.
Roger.
I'm not gonna take any marks.
Roger. I understand.
Casper, we've got the LOI-minus-5 flyby PAD whenever you're ready to copy.
Stand by one.
Roger.
We got Casper's keeper over in the Lunar Module taking a peek, and we'll be closing it out and we'll get it in a minute.
Rog. Understand.
Pete, you - really get to be a real believer in the heating capacity of the Sun. In the Lunar Module here, the commander's window is in direct sunlight, and it's almost too hot to touch it. My window's in the shade, and it's got fro - it's frosted over.
Roger. [Pause.]
Okay; we gonna close her out, Pete.
Okay, Charlie.
Houston, the hatch is closed; the drogue is installed; the probe's installed; the hatch is installed on our side; the LM Tunnel Vent valve is in LM/CM Delta-P; the tunnel lights are off. Is it okay if we go to PTC; set up PTC now, or do y'all want to wait until 34?
Stand by one. [Long pause.]
16, you can go ahead and do the PTC.
Okay.
16, in addition to the LOI flyby PAD, we've got some cryo tank configuration changes for you. [Pause.]
Okay. If you can hold up for a second on that.
Roger.
Hey, Houston; 16. You can go ahead with the cryo tank reconfiguration.
Okay. On the cryo tanks, we want H2 Tanks 1 and 2 Heaters, Auto; and Tank 3 Fan, Off. Oxygen Tanks 1 and 2 Heaters, Off; Tank 3 Heater, Auto. [Pause.]
Okay. Rog. Configuration now: H2 Heaters 1 and 2, Auto; O2 Heaters 1 and 2, Off; 3, we're in Auto. That's as we had it. H2 Fans 1 and 2, Off; and 3, Off.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay. [Garble] Houston, you can go ahead with the LOI-minus-5 PAD.
Okay, LOI minus 5 flyby, SPS/G&N; 66603; plus 1.24, minus 0.12; 069:28:26.27; plus 0039.8, minus 0118.9, plus 0422.9; 210, 193, 346; NA; HP is plus 0020.4; 0441.1; 1:07, 0436.5; sextant star 14, 124.8, 17.4; the next three lines are not applicable. Latitude, minus 23.03, minus 165.00; 1100.9, 36207; 142:23:42. Set stars Sirius and Rigel, 219, 166, 313. Ullage, none. Other: number 1, burn SPS docked; 2, PAD based on PTC REFSMMAT; 3, LM weight, 36287. [Long pause.]
Rog, Pete. LOI minus 5 flyby, SPS/G&N; 66603; plus 1.24, minus 0.12; 069:28:26.27; plus 0039. I missed Delta-VY, Delta-VZ is plus 0422.9; 210, 193, 346; HA is NA; plus 0020.4; 4411, 107, 0436.5; 14, 124.8, 174; NA; latitude minus 23.03, minus 165.00; 1100.9; 362.07; 142:23:42. Sirius and Rigel; 219, 166, 313. Ullage is none. Notes are: 1, burn SPS docked; PTC REFSMMAT; LM weight, 36287, which is 30 pounds heavier than we had this morning.
Roger. We'll take a look at that, and the Delta-VY is minus 0118.9. [Pause.]
Minus. Rog; minus 0118.9.
That's affirmative. Gol.
Is that because we took the film over there? [Pause.]
Say again, Charlie.
I said we took all that film over there, maybe that's the 30 pounds.
Affirmative, that's where it came from. [Long pause.]
And, 16, we still have this note to go on the Sun wheel. [Pause.]
Stand by.
Omni Charlie, 16.
16, your rates are okay, any time you want to go into PTC.
[Faint.] Okay, Pete. Thank you.
16, Omni Bravo, and then we'll take care of the antennas.
Omni Bravo, Houston.
Roger. Thank you.
16, Houston.
Go ahead, Pete.
Okay...
Go ahead, Pete.
Okay, just a last few words here. We don't have anything for you except one note to Ken. Earlier you asked about whether or not the PAD we read you contained the correct bias for the EMS; we told you it did, and we've looked at it a little more now, and actually it turns out it did not. The bias on that one was less than a foot per second, I guess. In the future, we will include that bias in the PAD.
Okay, thank you now.
Rog and we're ready to copy any time you can give us the onboard read-outs and get into the Flight Plan here at about 37. [Pause.]
Rog. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. Bat C is 37; Pyro Bat A is 37; Pyro Bat B, 37. [Long pause.]
RCS A is readinkg 87; RCS B, 92; RCS C, 93; RCS D, 96. Is that what you wanted, the quantity of the RCS?
That's affirmative. And we copied 37, 37, 37, 87, 92, 93, and 96. [Pause.]
That's - that's correct, and Main Bus - Bus A is reading 29 plus volts. [Long pause.]
Ken, for your information, the PTC looks beautiful; in fact, it was so good, it took some of us quite a while to realize you were in a PTC. [Pause.]
Gee, and my attitude hold looks a lot like that too.
Rog. [Pause.]
All in the technique for the way you hit Proceed.
Roger; honest (laughter).
Houston, let me read you this cryo tank configuration, and you tell me if that's what you want for the sleep period.
Okay. [Pause.] Go ahead, 16; we're...
[Garble] over.
Go ahead, 16; we're ready to copy the cryo configurations.
Okay. H2 Heaters are - 1 and 2 are in Auto. O2 Heaters 1 and 2 are Off, 3 is in Auto. H2 Fan 1 - 1 and 2 are Off, and 3 is in Auto. [Long pause.]
16, the H2 tank 3 Fan should be Off. [Pause.]
Okay. H2 tank 3, Off. [Long pause.]
And, Houston, for your information, the LM/CM Delta-P gauge has not moved since we equalized the two vehicles.
Roger. Understand, 16. [Long pause.]
And, 16, would you verify optics power, Off? [Pause.]
No, sir; we aren't ready to turn it off just yet.
Okay.
Houston, 16. Over.
Hello, 16. Houston.
Are you ready for a Verb 74? [Pause.]
Roger. We're standing by. Go ahead. [Pause.]
What do you do on the graveyard shift, Hank?
Oh, that's lots of fun. Get to watch y'all snooze. [Pause.]
Okay. Direct O2's on, the cabin's coming up now.
Roger. Copy.
E-Mod complete, 16.
Thank you.
Okay, Houston. Direct O2 is off.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, Casper.
Hello, Casper. Go ahead. [No answer.]
Casper, Houston. Go ahead. [No answer.]
Casper, Houston. Go ahead. [No answer.]
[Extremely weak signal.] [Garble.]
Casper, Houston. If you're transmitting, you're way down in the mud. I can't read you. [Pause.]
Can you read now, Hank?
Okay. Much better now, Ken. [Pause.]
Okay. I say - I got a film status report for you. And I'd like to ask you a question about the optics. I'd like to stow the optics instead of leaving them up, unless the temperatures are gonna get too high. And the reason for this is that every time we run around past the Sun, it's like throwing a spotlight inside.
Roger. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Okay, Ken, go ahead with your film status, and we're looking at that stowing the optics. [Pause.]
Okay, the magazine OO reads 26, magazine November November is either 33 or 34, depending on how you look at it. We finished up the 16-millimeter mag on Alpha Alpha by taking some pictures of the - part of the LM paint that we think is shredding. Magazine Oscar and November have been used just for the targeted pictures - no extras. And I guess that's - We didn't take any other original pictures today except for the AA frames on the LM. Tomorrow we'll try to get some interior photography. [Pause.]
Okay. Copy 26 frames on Oscar Oscar. The November November report we got last night was 33 frames. You didn't use any of it today?
Well, just for that UV. So whatever it was last night, it must be one more.
Okay. 34. [Long pause.]
And, Ken, it's okay to stow the optics.
Okay, Henry, thank you. And I'd like to go ahead and take the voice comm down before I turn the optics power off. I wanted to try to take one last look and see if I can pick up one of the planets as we turn around, and I'd like to go ahead and knock off the voice. [Long pause.]
Okay, Ken, get the voice down. Have a good night.
Okay, Henry. See you in the morning. Good night, sir.
Houston, Casper.
Hello, Casper, go ahead.
Okay, I'm not sure what just happened. I just saw - down looking at the optics and all of a sudden I saw a warning light and I got a No Attitude and a Gimbal Lock light. And my - my ball seems to, in fact - it looks like the platform may be frozen. [Pause.] Although we're still - still in PTC here.
Okay, we're seeing some telemetry. We saw something about the time you come on the line there.
Okay. And it shows the CDUs down there in Noun 20 as being gimbal locked. [Long pause.]
Stand by a little bit, Ken. We're taking a look at the telemetry.
Ken, just so we can make sure we got it straight down here, could you run through again what you were doing, and then the sequence of events?
Okay, Hank, I'm not real sure when this happened. I was trying to see if I couldn't pick up one of the planets in the optics, and I was using P52. And I had gone in and I was calling Option 3 and then putting in planet vectors out of the Flight Plan and I tried - I thought I was going to catch, I guess it was Saturn and it looked like I had just missed it. And I was driving around just kind of looking around to see what I could see in the sky and waiting to try and pick up Jupiter. And somewhere in there, I guess I came down to zero the optics or do something, and then I looked down and saw I had a PGNCS light. And I guess I had just - recently - I guess I was about ready to give up on it and call P00; and I think I had - in fact, I think I called P00 at or just before the time I - we ended up with the Gimbal Lock and the No Attitude. That was just a couple of seconds or so, I guess, before I called you about it, maybe 15 seconds or so.
Okay, You got a Gimbal Lock...
I can't, think of any combination of DSKY inputs - I was trying to think if I could have made some combination of DSKY inputs that might have - Had I gotten in almost the right input that I could have caused the problem, but I don't see where I was using any verbs or nouns that could have done this. [Pause.]
Okay, you got a Gimbal Lock and No Att. Did you get an ISS warning?
No, sir; I did not.
Go Guidance.
And the - the Noun 20s were approximately correct for both pitch and roll, although the - the middle gimbal angle was completely out to lunch.
Houston, Casper.
Go ahead, Ken. [Pause.]
I'd like for you to think about the effects of having me go ahead and do a Verb 41 Noun 20 to match up with the SCS. That thing's been drifting a good bit, but, in this case, maybe I can get it close enough to have a starting point to try and pick up some things. I'd been looking in the - had been looking in the telescope just before this all happened, and there's so much of this - so many of these little particles out there that chances of recognizing a star pattern are extremely dubious, I'd like to try. And maybe we can work on something like the Earth, maybe the Sun, or something like that.
Go G&C.
Okay, standby.
Okay. Do you want to stand by on this Verb 41 Noun 20 until you get your gimbal Lock removed? Okay, CapCom tell him we're working up - Thank you. [Long pause.]
Casper, Houston. We'd like you to hold up on the Verb 41 Noun 20. We're working on a procedure to try to get rid of the gimbal lock.
Okay. Did you have any data coming down at the time this all happened, or were you in the blind?
Rog. We had good high bit rate data, and they're poring over that now.
Okay. I'll sit tight then. Thank you.
Casper, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We want to try to get the platform inertial again, and what we'd like for you to do is a Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter, Enter, Verb 40 Enter. [Pause.]
Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter. Then you want me to put plus Enter into that register. [Pause.] Okay, that got rid of the Gimbal Lock light. Now you'd like for me to do a Verb 41?
Verb 40 Enter.
Okay. Verb 40 Enter. [Long pause.]
Okay. Our data shows the platform's inertial now, Ken. [Pause.]
Rog. And it appears that way from here, too. [Long pause.]
Okay. Ken, you can go ahead now with you Verb 41 Noun 20. [Pause.]
Okay. This will be a coarse align to the GDC angles, is that correct?
That's affirmative. [Long pause.]
Hey, Ken, hold up on that Verb 41 just a second.
Wilco. I'll go ahead and load it but won't enter.
Okay there. Guidance has got a little thing they're looking at and talking to people in the back room, little discussion going on here.
Okay. I won't do a thing, then. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Casper, Houston. Are the GDC ball and the IMU ball completely out of sync? [Long pause.]
Well, actually, they're not that far out. They're like ten degrees in outer gimbal and let's see the - I guess the middle gimbal is off by about two degrees, the inner gimbal no more than three, lots closer to two degrees.
Roger. Copy.
...that close.
Casper, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, I think we got the agreed-on procedure here - is to go ahead with the Verb 41 Noun 20. That's procedure - in the G&C Checklist - 7-1. And reset the REFSMMAT - REFSMMAT flag and press on through that.
Okay. I guess, based on our drifts, I'm not sure that's any better, but I guess that's no worse, so I'll just go to that one, then.
Okay; 7-1. [Pause.]
Okay. That's Page 7-1. Understand.
Hank, it's not clear, I'm gonna be able to find any stars with no closer alignment than I have on this thing. Looks like I'm gonna have to get a - a coarser alignment by using some big objects like Earth or something like that.
Okay. Are those particles out there giving you a lot of trouble?
That's all there is. They're just everywhere. [Pause.]
When you combine them with the limited area that you have to look in because of the LM reflections, you find the telescope's very unsatisfying. [Long pause.]
Casper, Houston. Why don't you go ahead and try then, with the - the Sun and the Moon? You've got a filter for the Sun, right?
That's affirmative.
Houston, Casper.
Go ahead.
Okay. I used the Earth and the Sun, and I got four balls 7, which I think is gonna be a significant improvement. I'd like to go ahead and see what those torquing angles turn out to be.
Roger. We concur.
Okay. That looks about right for the amount that I had to correct for. It's - it's kind of hard to mark on the Earth because you have to guess where the - where the - the terminator really ought to be. [Long pause.]
and do you have those torquing angles?
Roger, Ken. Go ahead and torque.
Okay, Henry. If you have those angles, I'll torque these. [Long pause.]
Ken, what was your Noun 05?
Four balls one.
Roger.
Okay. I'll torque these at - on the minute, 11.
Okay, clear to torque.
Okay. It looks like we're pretty much on target now, and I don't see any reason to torque these again - unless you particularly want to. [Pause.]
Okay; we concur, Ken. Don't torque those. And we want to check a few switches. They're working on now getting a switch checklist, and then we're going to let you get some rest and smoke the data over during the night and have it stored for you in the morning.
Okay. Can you give me any - Can you give me any cursory ideas of that, just the same - if there's any possibility I entered something inadvertently? Or that take too long to sort all that out?
Okay. The preliminary look here - We think it's a hardware problem, Ken. Some sort of a transient problem...
Okay.
...and when we get the data in here, we'll be able to tell a little more about it.
Okay. Guess I'm sorry to hear that.
They - they don't think at this point that it's anything that you did, and it appears to be a transient problem, but we won't know until we take a look at it.
Okay. Let me give you one other little tidbit that now seems to be somewhat more of - of interest than it was before, and that's that when I take this Optics Zero to Zero, the area around the shaft peapack [?] makes a lot of - a lot more noise than the one in the trunnion. It seems to me that it's making more noise now than it used to. When I say used to, when we first started out - when we first started out, they were very, very quiet and you couldn't even hear them running. And now they're getting noisier. And that may be typical, but it's just one more thing that - I guess we'll throw out all these things. I'll try to minimize the number the times I zero the Optics, at least with the Zero switch. I'll use Manual wherever possible.
Okay. That only occurs when you're zeroing?
That's affirmative. [Pause.] Well, actually, Hank, I just tried it in Manual. It occurs when - the noise occurs whenever I'm in an extremely high rate. You know, like using high in a max shaft rate.
Roger; copy. [Long pause.]
Okay, Ken. We'd like to check some switches up on Panel 1. [Pause.]
Stand by a second. [Long pause.]
Okay. Go ahead, Hank.
Okay, we'd like to check position in FDAI Scale.
The Scale is in 5/1.
Okay, Select.
Select is in 1 [garble], the Source is in Attitude Set, and the Attitude Set is in GDC.
Okay. That's what we wanted to know. Thank you. [Pause.]
Okay, I think I'll go ahead and get some sleep then. Got any notes from [garble] yet?
Okay, stand by one sec. [Long pause.]
Okay, Ken. We don't have anything else [garble]. [Long pause.]
Casper, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. You caught us on the antenna switch. We don't have anything else for you. We'll look the data over, and try and get some word up to you tomorrow. It looks like to us now that you can get a full eight hours sleep. [Pause.]
Okay. [Laughter.] Thank you.
See you tomorrow.
Okay, Hank. How about - how about making it a duller shift?
Rog. [Laughter.]
