Okay, Houston. The waste water dump is terminated at about 12 percent.
Okay, Charlie. We copy that.
And, Tony, we're into the - equalizing the pressure CM/LM at this point.
Okay.
Apollo 16, Houston.
Go ahead.
When you're working up there in the hatch area, I've got a test for you on that Docking Latch 10, when it's convenient. You might let me know when you can work on it.
Okay, well. Why don't we wait 'til the guys get in the LM, then I'll work on that while they're doing that.
Sounds good.
Apollo 16, Houston. Omni Charlie.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. The Orion is on internal power at 53:28:34.
Okay. We copy that, Ken.
Houston, 16. We're in Orion now, and you - you've got the comm on; you should be getting high bit rate momentarily.
Okay, and we'd like to go to the High Gain.
Okay. You mean over on Casper's side? Okay.
That's signal strength for them.
Houston. Okay. We just got the signal strength on Orion.
Okay. We have LM data.
Hey, Tony, ask TELMU about this 192 package lanyard. I looked at it yesterday, and I could see red and green. It's way out and looks okay to me. Is that copacetic?
Okay. We'll find out. And, Charlie, we've got some changes to your Lunar Surface Checklist. Whenever it's convenient for you, we'll send them up to you.
Charlie, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. TELMU says that's okay; no problem.
That's fine, and what did you want to update? What checklist?
Okay, your Lunar Surface Checklist and your LM Cue Card for EVA prep.
Okay, Tony. I have the Cue Cards. Go ahead.
Okay. On the Cue Cards, it'll be all of them, EVA-1, -2, and -3; and I have one here for post-EVA. Okay. On the EVA-1, -2, and -3, after the sentence 'Read PLSS O2 quantity to Houston,' we'd like to add the line...
Wait, wait a minute, wait; hold on.
Rog.
Okay. I've got EVA-1 prep; now which column?
Okay. It's on the left-hand column, right at the bottom line; it says "Read PLSS O2 quantity to Houston.""
Okay. I've got the "Read PLSS O2 quantity to Houston"; the next one is a note, "If Comm is No Go." Is that the one you want?
Rog. We'd like to put a line in between "Read PLSS O2 quantity" and the note.
Go ahead.
Okay. "Squelch VHF B (LMP) - full decrease."
Okay. I got it.
Okay. And now the EVA-2 prep Cue Card.
Go ahead.
Okay. This is the left-hand column and this is - at the bottom, and we'll add the same line there, "Squelch VHF B (LMP) - full decrease."
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. On the EVA-3 prep, the same as EVA-2 prep.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. Now this is on the post-EVA-3 Cue Card.
I got it. Go ahead.
Okay. On the third column, one-third of the way down, it says, "Audio circuit breaker - Close."
Okay. Got it.
Okay. We'd like to add a line right after that. "Squelch VHF B (LMP) - noise threshold, plus 1½."
Okay.
Okay. The point of all of this is to increase the range of PLSS to LM, in case you're having a crew failure.
What else you got?
Okay. It's the same sort of changes to your Lunar Surface Checklist, and I'll read them to you when you're ready.
Okay, Tony. We never use that checklist in this time frame. We'll copy it in, in a little bit, okay?
Okay. That's fine.
Houston, 16.
Go ahead, Charlie.
Okay. I'm a little confused about your terminology, I guess. It says "Squelch VHF B (LMP) - full decrease." We only got one VHF B to squelch.
Roger; I understand that. The "LMP" was just a cue that you're the only one on the comm at the time, so you'll be the one to - to have to listen and get it down.
Okay.
Charlie, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. When you get a chance there, we'd like you to read the ED Voltage, both A and B.
Exactly the same thing as yesterday, 37 volts, Tony, both of them.
Okay. Good show, and verify Off.
Rog.
Okay, Apollo 16. I guess that's all they need in the Lunar Module. At your convenience, you can power down. And could you read that tunnel index as you go through, the docking index?
Strange to say, it hasn't changed any.
All right.
It's still minus three and a half.
Okay. We copy.
You going to tell me something about this Latch 10, too?
Okay.
Do you want us to do that now?
Yeah, it'd be a good time, if you're ready.
I'm sitting here looking at it.
Okay. On that docking latch Number 10, depress the yellow auxiliary release button, noting that the button will depress and whether it stays snapped in after being depressed. Now, the interest here is if the button will not depress, the latch mechanism is either stuck or broken. If the button stays snapped in, this indicates - or probably indicates that the latch was only partially cocked at launch...
It's in...
and stayed in.
It's in, and it stayed in.
Okay. Then, the indication there is that it was only partially cocked at launch.
Well, do you want me to re-cock it and fire it?
No, they had just as soon you leave it the way it is, because if it's broken, you may not be able to - to get it off again, and then that would foul up the undocking.
Sounds like a reasonable plan. Okay. I've got the Aux Release Button pushed in, and it stayed there, and the rest of it's gonna be left as is.
Okay. Good show. That's it.
Okay, Tony. We're going to get our suits on.
Okay.
And, Houston, we brought LM power back to the CSM at 53:49.
Okay, we copy that. And Ken, we have a correction to that TVC relay set condition.
Okay.
Okay, on the set in program P20, we read up previously that it wouldn't set in option 2. We've got a correction to that. It sets only in Options 0 and 4.
Understand; it sets in only Options 0 and 4.
That's correct.
Tony, I'm gonna try to get some pictures of selected portions of the suit donning on 16 millimeter. And I just checked here on the spotmeter, and it looks like the CIN is going to be marginal for this, and I'm looking at the - the BW that's available. And I wonder if anyone would object if I put it on magazine Hotel Hotel.
Okay, I'll check on that.
Thank you, sir.
And, Ken, Houston.
Go ahead.
When you're ready for that Jet Monitor program, we're ready to load it.
Okay; I - I'm in P00, and I'll give you Accept.
Okay.
You've got it.
Okay, and I guess you'll have to go to P20 for us to load it.
Okay, you want me to be in P20 first.
That's affirmative.
Well, that was almost right.
You're in Accept P20.
Okay.
Ken, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We've got an answer here on this Hotel Hotel. You have about ten percent available to use now if you like, and if you use the spotmeter inside, you'll have to set it for an ASA of 4000.
That's affirm, thank you. I can use ten percent.
That's right.
Ken, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We've got your program loaded. You can press on with the Noun 26.
You're gonna have to stand by a minute.
Okay.
Okay, Tony. What did you want? Noun 26 loaded up?
Right. You can go ahead and call your Noun 26.
Okay. I was - We're in the LM trying to get some pictures of their suit zipping up.
Rog. I'll bet that's a real hassle.
Yeah, it is.
Okay. Tony, does that - does that look right for a Noun 26?
Yeah, that looks right.
Thank you. The thing that I was questioning was the R36 not sliding over to the end.
Stand by one.
Ken, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. If you'll call up Verb 05 26, it'll slide over. Right now you're not reading the third register.
Thank you. Okay. You want me to do a Verb 31?
That's affirmative.
Okay, Ken. It's running.
Okay, and are we gonna check out the alarm function, or are we just gonna check out the loading capability?
I think they've got something in mind for alarm function later, but nothing right now.
Okay, thank you. I'm gonna go back over and see if I can get some pictures from the LM then.
Ken, Houston.
Go ahead.
I guess they'd like an E-Mod now.
You've got it.
Okay.
Anything else before I go over to the LM?
Everybody is shaking their head; I guess it's okay. About the time you get to the hatch, we'll think of something.
Okay.
And, Tony, we used only five percent on - it went from ten to 15 percent on magazine HH.
Okay. We copy that. And when you get back in the Command Module there, we'd like for you to go to Block on the CM.
Okay. I'm Block, and Charlie's coming up on the comm, and I'm going to don my suit.
Okay.
Houston, 16. How do you read?
You sound good, Charlie.
Okay.
Houston, 16.
Go ahead, Charlie.
Okay. We're back in the LM - I mean, correction - back in the Command Module, and Ken's closing out, putting the probe in right now.
Okay. Sounds good. And there's no hurry on this, but when Ken gets all comfortable, we've got that Jet Monitor test.
Okay. Ken's busy. We'll give you a call.
Okay.
16 - Houston, 16.
Go ahead.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. Tony, you read?
Sure do. Sounds - sounds good.
Okay. During the - the - suit donning went okay - in fact, pretty easy 'til we got to the part of zip - John and I zipping up. And in my suit in the LM, zipping up, John had an extremely difficult time getting the - the restraint zipper closed across the small of my back. It was extremely tight; the only way he was able to do it, was to zip the restraint - the restraint zipper in the front first, so that the zipper would line up a little bit better, and then he got the back part closed. Now the only thing that worries me is that the suit, to me, felt like I'd grown an inch or two, and it was tight in the legs, and I didn't have the LCG on. And with the LCG and everything else, it might have built up where it would have been really bad, and we were wondering if it might be possible to - if you guys would let us let the legs out on this suit maybe a half an inch to an inch. Over.
Okay. We'll talk about that.
Go ahead.
Okay. I'm not even sure that would help, but it felt - it feels like it would to me.
Okay.
Charlie, I guess that gives us a data point...
Tony, there was no - yeah, there was no trouble at all with the - with the pressure sealing zipper, it - or the pressure seal. It was just the - the restraint. And that was just in that one place in the small of my back.
Okay. We copy that. I guess that gives us a data point. You grow in zero g.
That's what it feels like - that I stretched out an inch or so.
You better watch that; you're pretty close to your six feet.
Too late now.
Okay. Tony, the hatch is back in.
Okay.
Houston, are you still there?
Oh, yeah, Ken, we're still here. How are you doing?
Just fine. We got the tunnel closed out, and I'm ready to copy your next procedure.
Okay, stand by one.
Ken, Houston.
Go.
Okay. We'd like you to disable all the B/D roll jets, and you're cycling against the stops about once every ten minutes, and so expect that you'll get your ISS light some time in there, and when you get it, we don't - you can turn back on the jets; we'd just like to look at it a while.
Okay. How about if I just go Free?
Okay. I guess the Free kills the Jet Monitor.
Oh, okay.
Ken, Just to verify that, if you go Free - CMC Free - the program doesn't monitor; if you go back to Auto, it does. You don't have to put the program back in.
Rog. I understand that. I guess I just wasn't thinking then. What I - what I did, Tony, was, rather than leave - leave two axes in control and one of them free, I put all the Manual Attitude switches to Accel Command, and we're still in CMC Mode, Auto.
Rog. We saw that down here. It looks good.
Okay. You can - you know, you can watch it all day long - whatever you want there.
Okay. We'll just watch.
Sure enough; there it is.
Okay. Seems to work.
And, sure enough, just like advertised, there's no status lights on - DSKY warning panel. And I'm gonna go ahead - if it's okay with you, I'll turn off the Channel 11, Bit 1.
Okay. Go ahead.
While we're still outside the deadband, that's not going to work unless I cycle it Free and back to recenter the deadband. You folks want to watch it outside the deadband for a while?
That's okay. I guess we're happy with it, and we'd like to go ahead and terminate it - terminate the...
Okay.
And, Ken, I guess you can go on to PTC at your convenience.
Okay. Just getting ready to ask you about that. Thank you.
Okay.
Do you folks have me to continue using B/D roll?
Rog. B/D roll.
Okay, Apollo 16. Omni Charlie.
Charlie, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, On your tight suit, there, we were wondering if you could say a few words about how it felt during launch day.
Well, it was a little - little tight launch day. We'd - you know, fitted it pressurized, Tony, and it felt okay then. Launch day, I thought the legs were a little tight but not much.
Once we get it zipped, Tony, it feels a little tight, but pressurized it's okay. It's just the zipping part that was worrying us.
Understand.
Well, everybody's thinking about it, and we'll come back with an answer on it later. Right now I think the general feeling is that most people'd just as soon you not tamper with it unless you feel very strong about it.
Well, that's our opinion, too. Our next solution, or our next question is - is maybe breaking out with the LCG and putting all the gear on and seeing how it goes with all of the gear. Our question there is, if we break into one of the LCGs right now, will it affect - get any gas in the tubes; would it affect the startup on the PLSS?
Okay, we'll work that one.
Okay, Charlie, we've looked at that LCG problem and you're right. If you break it out early, we'll probably get gas in there and never be able to get it out, and it will affect your cooling.
Okay. John and I were going to break into those LCGs and sleep in them the night prior to PDI. What do you think about that idea, then?
Okay; they're over there scratching their head again.
Ken, Houston.
Go ahead. Over.
Okay; your rates are low enough for the PTC.
Okay; thank you.
Apollo 16, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, we'd like your onboard reading, the H2 tank 1 pressure.
270, Houston.
Okay, we copy that.
Okay, Ken. That's - that transducer problem, probably - they've had that history of problems with that transducer. Prelaunch.
Yeah, we remember that.
Okay.
It was glitching launch day, but it looks like now it's sort of stabilized.
Okay.
Apollo 16, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We'd like you to go to Omni Bravo, and stow the High Gain. And we'll handle the switching.
Okay. You have Omni Bravo.
Houston, 16.
Go ahead.
Okay; we're getting reader to go to work on this Skylab food preparation bit, and we're trying to check out some camera settings and all. We've got 16-millimeter magazine allocated for this with CIN film in it, and by checking the most light that I can get on most objects, it looks like we'll be running with the lens wide open aperture at about 1/60 of a second. And I guess I'd like to know if you want to do that, or if you'd like to use a higher ASA and process the film differently.
Okay; we'll talk about that.
Tony, I was just looking here, and if we go to the 18-millimeter lens, we can open it up to a - to a T-1. And that gets our speed up to about 1/250. It looks like a lot better way to operate.
Ken, the comm's pretty bad right now. We're having a hard time getting that. We understood that the light meter indicates that the film that was indicated to use here probably isn't going to be fast enough, and you're asking to use a faster film. But we didn't und - get there, how severe the problem was.
Houston, 16.
Go ahead, Ken. The comm's still pretty bad, though.
Okay, we were going to get started on the bistatic radar frequency check, if you're ready. [Long pause.
Okay, Charlie, I guess we'd like for you to hold off for a minute on that VHF test.
All right.
Ken, Houston. The comm may be a little better now, if you'd go through the problem again.
Okay, Tony. It looks like it's not as bright in here as we'd like to be able to get it, and we'll try - try timing it with some of the window shades up to see if we can get it a little brighter. With the cabin floodlights, it looks like 1/60 of a second is about the max I can get off of the 10-millimeter lens. And I was going to suggest either going to the 18, which will give me a little faster shutter speed because it's got a wider aperture, or we'll take a little less photography and just do it when the Sun gives us good illumination through one of the windows.
Okay, we copy that. We'll work it.
I think we can get more uniform photography if we did it with the window shades up and with all our lights in one fixed position. That way, we'll get a lot more photography done rather than having to wait. I really don't think you can afford to wait until the Sun's in just the right place to do your eating.
Rog. Understand.
Okay, Tony, we're going to restow my suit, if you guys don't want us to touch it.
Right, we're not gonna worry about it tonight. We'll have some sort of an answer tomorrow. So you go ahead and stow the suit.
Okay. And our H2 tank pressure just went back - dropped back down to 240.
Okay. We saw that.
Hup! It's back up to 270.
Ken, Houston.
Ken, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. After much debate, I guess we can have you go ahead and use the 18 millimeter.
Okay; thank you.
All right. If you're not already done with it.
I really think we'll get the - We're - we're stowing one of our passengers here back in his suit bag.
All right.
And...
Okay, I - We're...
We're having - You'd be surprised just how long those kind of things take. You know, you start on something like that, and then it almost fits and you refold it, and it almost fits again, and it's only because you know it fits that you keep trying with it. Because you sure couldn't prove it by us.
Understand. It doesn't sound like too much fun. We'd like to reverse ourselves...
No, I didn't say that.
Right. We'd like to reverse ourselves on something I sent up awhile ago. It doesn't seem to be any problem with breaking out the LCGs early. They were thinking about a Skylab situation. So that won't be a constraint. As far as whether we want you to try it tomorrow, we'll work that and send it up tomorrow. But there'll be a...
Okay, I guess the only thing on that is that we've got a busy day coming, and these things just really take a long time by the time you put on the suit, and then you play with it and then if we have some adjustments to do, too, why, it's going to take a block of time.
Right. Understand.
So the sooner the better, I guess, which I know you know already.
Rog. But I particularly wanted to let you know there was no problem with sleeping in it that night before.
That's a big help. Thank you.
Yeah, I didn't think there was. That's what they did on Apollo 10.
Rog.
Remember Apollo 12, guys, before you do too much with that suit.
Okay.
Of course, the problem is going to be if we can't get it on at all. That's going to be a real problem.
Rog.
Apollo 16, Houston.
Apollo 16, Houston.
Apollo 16, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We'd like to start with the VHF test when you're ready.
Okay. Give us a couple of minutes here.
Okay.
Okay, Tony. We have - VHF Antenna's on Left, B is in Duplex, and the Ranging is On.
And we're getting the VHF?
Roger.
Apollo 16, Houston.
Apollo 16, Houston.
Apollo 16, Houston.
Apollo 16, Houston.
Apollo 16, Houston.
Go ahead, Tony.
Okay, We're gonna drop your S-band up-link for a little while. We'll be back in about ten minutes.
Roger; understand.
Apollo 16, Houston.
Go ahead, Tony.
Okay, we're back early. We'd like you to go ahead and terminate the VHF, and, while you're over that way, we'd like you to switch the High Gain to Wide Beam.
Roger, High Gain going to Wide, and terminate the VHF.
Rog.
Okay. The VHF is terminated and you got Wide on the High Gain.
Okay.
Houston, 16.
Go ahead, Ken.
We're trying to work on the presleep checklist, and this little part about the Optics to Zero and then the - Optics Power Off. Will any of that do these things we don't want to do with our TVC enable? How about just leaving it all like it is?
Okay; we're working on it.
Okay; Houston, you ready for the onboard readouts?
Yep. Go ahead.
Houston, Apollo 16. Over.
Go ahead, Apollo 16. We're ready to take the readouts.
Apollo 16, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 16. Over.
Okay. I guess we had a - a weak period there. Yes, we're ready for your readout.
Okay, Battery C is 36.7. Pyro Batteries: A, 37; Pyro Battery B, 37; RCS A, 87; B, 90; C, 92; and D, 96. We're on Main A, 29 volts.
Okay; we copy that.
And you'll be happy to know we completed the Skylab Food Evaluation with very few casualties.
Congratulations.
And no loss of life.
Very good.
However, it took a lot longer than we allowed for it.
Okay.
And, Apollo 16, I guess it's okay to go to that Optics Zero in Zero, which you are, and G&N Power Optics, Off.
Okay. Thank you now.
We aim to please.
Okay. Houston, are you ready for the E-memory dump? Over.
Okay, I guess we'd just like you to skip the E-Mod.
And, Apollo 16; Houston.
Apollo 16, Houston.
Houston, you ready for a good old E-memory dump?
Okay, John; do you copy us now?
Yep, finally.
Okay, I think we'd like you to just skip that E-Mod tonight. We do have a couple of changes to Panel 230 when you get down that way.
Oh yeah; we plumb forgot about that. Okay, go ahead.
Okay. We'd like to - Pan Camera Self Test, Off.
That's Off.
Mapping Camera, Off.
That's Off.
And then down there below, the Service Module/AC Power, Off.
Okay, and that's Off.
Okay. That's all we've got.
Hi, 16. Can I talk to somebody about chlorine injection?
Okay. What's the problem?
I'm not sure what the first problem is; I can give you some symptoms. I put the chlorine in, and when I screwed down on it, it seemed like it was just a little bit stiffer to screw down on than they had been before. But it wasn't obvious that it was that much different; because they're always a little tight. And when I went to take it off, I got a whole lot of water bubbling out from around the - the port. And I couldn't tell where it came from. Seemed like it - the first thing I thought of was the same thing that happened to 15 with the nut backing off. And when I got it out, it looked like the - the bubbling seemed to stop fairly quickly, and then I - the first thing I tried to do was to tighten the collar of the adapter down tight, and right now I still have the chlorine injector adap - needle adapter still on the chlorine port. And I tightened it down by hand, and it seems like it's holding it. The chlorine ampoule itself was broken when we took it out of the injector drum. We got all of that mopped up. I wanted to get some buffer in with it - you know, the system, because it looked to me like some of the chlorine had gone in. So I started to try to put some buffer in, and it looked like it might have leaked a little bit. And then I went to take it out - out of the - take the injector out of the adapter, and when I did, it looks like it squirts fluid from two holes that are 180 apart from each other on the adapter. And I guess I don't know what those two holes are for. It looks like maybe the needle is not going in, but I'm not sure what it is, now. Do you have someone that might know how to put it together?
Roger; we'll talk about that. I know all about those two holes in that adapter.
Okay, these are the two on the outside now.
Rog. I know exactly which ones you're talking about.
Ken, Houston.
Okay, go ahead.
Okays, when you put that buffer in, would you verify that you left the nut all the way screwed down for the ten minutes and that's the period when the water was coming out the two holes.
No, the water comes out of those holes - Let's see now. I put the buffer in, I put it into the injector and then I put the injector into the adapter, and when I went to screw down on the injector, it looked like it was starting to seep fluid around the injector again. So I stopped, and it didn't look like it was doing any more, and I thought I would look and see. By this time, I was getting suspicious that maybe the needle wasn't open. So I decided to take the injector off of the needle adapter. I took it off, and everything looked okay. And it was when I went to put it back on, when I depressed the needle to - when you push the injector onto the adapter - that's when it looked like it squirted out of these two holes on the side and I did that several times and it repeated itself.
Okay, we copy that. Was the nut snugly against the ampoule when you tried to put it back on? If you backed off on the nut, it may have allowed the - it may have allowed the ampoule to slide back up in the compartment there and then you were just opening up the needle.
Well, I - I thought it was down snug. If it wasn't snug, would have - would it push water out of those two side ports?
Yes, it sure would. I had that happen in the prechlorination there on the pad before launch. I had backed off on the nut and, instead of just filling up that ampoule, the water pushed the ampoule off the needle and then, once it's done that, the water just goes back around and comes out those two holes.
Well, I can't say that didn't happen. The first problem occurred with the chlorine injection.
Right, I didn't see that on the pad.
Yep. My first problem was when I went to put the chlorine ampoule in. And at some point in there when I went to take it out, I tried to get it in and it didn't look right. When I went to take it out, it started bubbling all over, and I couldn't tell where it was coming from then. And whether it came from those two holes or not, that's quite possible. I'm not sure. When I looked at the ampoule itself, after I opened up the injector, you could see that the - the bottom lug had broken, the little sliding plug in there.
Right. Once that thing isn't watertight anymore, you'll get leakage into that container and that'll all come out those holes.
Okay. Then perhaps the only problem was the - was the one with the first ampoule breaking.
All right, we'll try to get you a procedure here and go back and try that buffer again.
The rest of it...
Say again.
I was going to say we'll try to get you to agree on a procedure here and then go back and try the buffer again.
Okay. I guess - yeah, we could do that.
Okay. Hold off on that. We'll - we'll get a procedure.
Okay. Is that something you want to do tonight or do it tomorrow?
You want that buffer in there tonight, don't you?
I don't know. It's a - I - I can't vouch for how much chlorine went in. Perhaps - very little. It's up to the - the guys who have plumbing responsibilities. I - I just can't tell you how much chlorine may have gotten in.
Okay, we understand.
Okay, Ken. I - I guess we'd like you to take that buffer ampoule again and screw the nut down on it so that you think it's - it's good - good and snug in there, and then put it on the adapter and see if you can - see if it'll take the buffer. Before you - you close it all up again, you might look at the ampoule to make sure it hasn't cracked.
Ken, Houston.
Ken, Houston.
Go ahead.
Did you get that about going ahead with the buffer?
No, I didn't.
Oh, okay; we probably had some bad comm there. We'd like you to take a look at that buffer ampoule and make sure it isn't cracked and, if not, then to go ahead and put it in that little container and screw that nut so you feel it's good and snug and then go ahead and see if it will take the buffer.
Okay. How about if I just take a brand new one? Don't we have a couple spares?
Okay. Yeah, they agree. Why don't you take a brand new one.
Okay. And while I'm doing that, I'm just looking over the gauges, and I know our onboard gauging isn't the greatest thing in RCS. Could you tell me how we stand on RCS?
Okay. I'll get that.
And, Ken, at 54 hours, you were two percent ahead of your RCS budget - that's 25 pounds to the good.
Okay. Thank you.
Uh-huh.
I guess we have a low bias in quad A and just kind of looks bad.
Okay. We - our bias is that you're reading 2 percent low on that.
Okay.
Okay. Tony, I've got the buffer in, and I noticed just a slight little spit when I put it in. That's probably residual. So I'll wait ten minutes and then suck it out.
Okay. Good show.
Okay, Houston. The O2 Flow High and the cabin is pumped up to 5.7.
Okay. We copy that, John.
Ken, Houston.
Okay, Tony, got that buffer in and out, and all looks normal now.
Okay. Good show.
Houston, 16.
Go ahead, Ken.
Okay. Looks like we've got the buffer in and water back out, and everything looks normal now.
Good show. If - if you didn't get much chlorine in the buffer, won't hurt anything, but it would have hurt the other way if you'd put the chlorine in without adding the buffer, so - either way, we're in good shape now.
Okay. Then I guess our only problem then was just the fact that I probably broke that first chlorine ampoule some way.
Rog.
Okay, Tony. I guess I'm ready to give you a film status report.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. On magazine Victor Victor, we're on frame 21; magazine Hotel Hotel, frame 85; magazine Oscar Oscar, frame 34; November November is also 34; Juliet Juliet is 50 percent.
Was that 50 percent?
That's 50 percent. That's affirmative.
Okay.
Okay. We copied all those.
Okay, I guess we're about ready to sign off. Do you folks have any last words or any questions?
Houston, we're about ready to go to sleep. You got any questions or anything you want to tell us before we shut down the comm system?
Okay. We're running around here to make sure there's nothing. I just read through your last system report that came around here, and everything looks nominal. Everything really looks great. Okay, I guess there's...
looks good to us, too.
Good show. And I guess there's nothing else down here. Would you like me to hum to you?
Tony, even that won't keep me awake.
Oh, yeah, it would. I'll see y'all on the Moon. I've got a day off tomorrow.
Good show.
Okay.
Sounds good. See you tomorrow.
Rog.
Good night.
