Houston, 16. Over.
Roger, 16. Loud and clear. Go ahead.
Okay. You're 5 by. The coastline is under us. It's beautiful, and we're standing by for some words. The spacecraft has been holding attitude just perfect in pitch.
Okay, John. We'll take a look at the APS module here.
Okay.
Gordy, why the late acquisition?
Houston, 16. Over.
Go ahead, 16.
Okay, how are you coming on the PADs, Gordy?
Okay, I'm ready with the TLI plus 90 and the P37 for lift-off plus eight. We're putting together a story and looking at the APS module. No immediate action is necessary, so let's get the PADs out of the way.
Okay, fine. Go ahead.
Okay, TLI plus 90, SPS/G&N; the weight is 66973; minus 0.54, plus 1.89; time of ignition is 004:03:18.55; minus 0356.2, plus four balls 1, plus 3600.7; 181, 234, 002; HA is NA; HP, plus 0018.9; 3618.3, 5:04, 3602.0; sextant star is 26, 073.4. Stand by 1. We got a handover coming up; I'll get the rest in a minute.
Charlie, this is Houston. How do you read now?
Okay, 5/5 Gordy. Go ahead.
Okay, shaft was 073.4, trunnion, 15.1; boresight star 037, up 25.7, right 2.9; minus 21.31, minus 165.00; 1093.2, 34867; and 0.05g time is 023:08:28. Sirius and Rigel; 317, 108, 005. No ullage. Go ahead.
Okay, TLI plus 90, SPS/G&N; 66973; minus 0.54, plus 1.89; 004:03:18.55; minus 0356.2, plus four balls 1, plus 3600.7; 181, 234, 002; HA is NA; plus 0018.9; 3618.3, 5:04, 3602.0; 26, 073.4; 15.1; 037, 025.7 correction - that's up 25.7, right 2.9; minus 21.31, minus 165.00; 1093.2, 34867; 023:08:28. Sirius and Rigel; 317, 108, 005. No ullage.
Okay, readback correct. Ready for Lift-Off plus 8.
Speak.
008:00; Delta-VT is 7948, minus 165, 022:06. Go ahead.
Rog. P37 for lift-off plus 8: 008:00, 7948, minus 165, 022:06, and ready for TLI.
Okay, readback correct, and TLI PAD: Time Base 6 predict, 2:23:57; attitude 179, 113, 000; burn time is 5:43, 10373.0, 35589; Sep attitude is 359, 146, 319; extraction 301, 326, 041; R2 align 112.7, 107.2, 57:20, and yaw is 001. Go ahead.
Rog. Give me Delta-VC again.
Delta-VC is 10373.0.
Okay, copy. TLI, 2:23:57...
Stand by one, Charlie.
Okay.
Handover.
Okay. Go ahead, Charlie.
Okay, 2:23:57; 179, 113, 000; 5:43; 10373.0, 35589, 359, 146, 319; 301, 326, 041; 112.7, 107.2, 57:20, 001. Over.
Readback is good.
Okay, Gordy - that Stateside pass, the part I saw was just super. He - the other guys saw Ellington as we went over.
How about that? Say, Charlie. Got an update to the ORDEAL monitor numbers on page L2-28 and 29.
Stand by.
Okay, you speak.
Okay, we got a - last-minute change. Stand by on that. Sorry.
We'd like Command Module UpTel, Accept, for a new vector.
Okay, you got it.
Okay, and words on the APS module. It appears to be operating, not completely normally, but adequately - that we predict that it'll be good through TLI and TD&E with no change in procedure. Over.
Outstanding prediction.
Okay, and back to what we started earlier, on L2-2-28, Charlie. Opposite 56 minutes, "Slew FDAI number 1 to Pitch equal 17," change 17 to 16. Over.
Okay, go ahead. It was changed to 16.
And next page, after the ORDEAL start time, change that to 57:20 rather than 57 even.
Okay, ORDEAL start, 57:20.
That's affirmative. And then, "Ensure FDAI number 1 Pitch equal to 11" rather than 13, inside the box there.
Okay, at 57 minutes, I've changed that to 57:20 to start the ORDEAL and the - ensure FDAI number 1 pitch is at 11.
Okay, and then the blank under there, "Maneuver to R2 ignition," attitude is 107 as printed in parentheses.
Okay, we copy.
That's good. And the CMC is yours. The up-link is complete.
Okay, and we're back in Block.
Okay, Gordy. We're standing by with the SECS Arm.
Roger. Stand by. Go ahead, we're watching.
Okay, Houston, stand by for the Logic.
Roger.
Okay, Logic 1's going on, up; Logic 2, on, up.
Mark.
Okay, you're Go for Pyro Arm.
Roger. Thank you, sir.
And I'd like to update a procedure. The APS-module fail procedure - one step in that, just in case the prediction is wrong and it does fail to - If you can get that page out, I'll give you a short update.
Okay, Charlie's got it.
Okay, Charlie. Center of the procedure, it says "DSE command burn mode on," cross that line out. And the one below it says "If successful, Launch Vehicle Guidance, IU." And, after the line that says "Control pitch and yaw with THC, roll with RHC," add "Keep rates below two-tenths degree per second, pitch and yaw; six-tenths degree per second in roll to avoid fighting the other APS module." Over.
Rog. We understand.
Okay, that's it.
16, Houston. We're about a minute and a half to LOS. No further updates. Everything looks good. Canaries should have their antenna fixed, and we should be good as we go through their site. Over.
16, Roger.
Put it to the side and right there. like -.
Could you - you switch to G&C and do a Verb 46 and drive around a little while?
We've already got a Verb 46. That's standard. I was just curious if you had tried...
No. No. I really.
Okay. I'm not advocating that you do.
Okay.
I would rather see that we do the most nominal things that the world has ever seen.
You better believe it.
But if we do something off of that, I just thought it would be nice to record it. What we found out. That's all...
Yeah.
have to it.
I could sure use a drink of water, but I sure don't want to...
Want me to get it for you?
Yeah. But I don't want to...
Okay?
No, I'll get it.
Hey, look, you don't have to.
Okay.
Yeah, let's all take a drink of water.
Here. I'll put the binos up.
Okay. We'll have to stick this in that bag, wherever it is.
Oh, I put it up - up here through TLI. Okay. How' s that?
We need it right after TLI...
Yeah, it won't be far away.
How about just on the velcro over here?
I'd like to tighten this down.
For launch, it should be up somewheres,Charlie, because I think burns five minutes of engine, you get up to darn near two-thirds of a g.
Well, I was gonna put it on the shelf - girth shelf, on the Velcro.
Well, but it might - if you got an attitude excursion.
Okay.
16, Houston through Canary.
Loud and clear, Gordon.
Okay, a little - a little down in the mud, but I think I can understand you.
Okay.
Hey, Gordy, we heard you there before we got the signal strength. That must have been on the...
VHF.
VHF, huh?
You are clear but weak.
Okay, we got - we got.
Okay, how do you read now, Gordy?
Loud and clear, Charlie.
Okay, our signal strength's up to max now.
Roger.
16, Houston.
Go ahead. Over.
We'd like the H2 Tank 3 Fans to Auto. Over.
Roger; H2 Tank 3 Fans going to Auto.
Oh, look at that horizon. Isn't that pretty? You got one out your side, too, Charlie?
Yeah.
Isn't that fantastic?
Oh!
Just as blue and pretty!
Can't you imagine that.
open.
went.
16, Houston. About 30 seconds to LOS. We should get - should have you through ARIA at 2:22, a couple of minutes later than shown in the Flight Plan. Over.
Roger; understand.
Did - did he ever say anything about why we got the thing late?
You know that's - Hey, you know, this light's on out there, Ken. Is that supposed to be?
What's that?
On that thing?
Whoops! Hmph. I didn't get my things on time.
(onboard): Let me see.
Okay.
Maybe I hit something. Boy, it gets in here.
Yeah. Well, we might - Do you want to run into the TLI? We got a - we're at 01:55.
Yeah. I'm going to go Low Bit Rate, Command Reset -. Command Reset. We better go into the TLI prep.
Okay, Translunar Inject, verify?
That's Inject.
Okay. EDS Power on up?
EDS Power coming on up.
Okay. Perform EMS Delta-V test and null bias check.
Okay.
And set the Delta-Vc.
1586.57
1586.57
Great.
Okay, Ken, I guess you can call P15.
All right..
Okay. want? 61 63?
63.
Okay..
Okay, Charlie.
Two.
Two.
23.
Minus 18.9 on the Delta-V test. That's pretty good, isn't it?
particularly. What's the next one?
20:57.
20:57, right?.
No, 57... 57. It's 67 seconds..
Okay, I got 02:23:57.
Go.
Now you run that for how much? 100 seconds?
Yeah. Okay, 14 is the. That was the Time Base 6. Isn't that right? Not the TLI.
Time Base 6...
count 0.3 for every five seconds count a tenth every five seconds..
All right. Okay.
It's this number right up here.
Okay. I'd just - You know, I'd feel bad TLI.
Yeah.
Okay, Noun 14 is cut-off. All right. Go on.
VI, you want 35589.
Okay, 35589.
Go.
35, 36.
Do you do this for 100 seconds?
Okay, well, there's a minute. Plus 100.
What's that gurgling?
Wait a minute. Okay. Wait a minute.
Four, three, two, one...
Mark it.
two and a half; 100 seconds. Five...
What's our pitch attitude, John? You got the optics there?
Yeah, full Moon.
You got ORDEAL on that?
Yep.
hundred?
Yeah; 95, actually.
All righty.
(onboard): Okay. Set Delta-VC, John.
Okay.
It's 10,373.0.
over there, Charlie.
Got it.
Charlie?
Oh, yeah. Look - look, John.
What?
(onboard): The fires. Out the right side. Looka there! They were right. They were really right.
What's that?
Beautiful!
The fires of Africa. They're there. Like he said. Isn't that spectacular?
That is really beautiful!
Can you see them, John?
Yeah, I see them. Yeah, yeah.
(Unreadable text).
Good gosh!
There must be a hundred or so.
over there.
What are they from?
Nomads.
And - and there's brush fires, sometimes.
Mostly, I - you know there's the - all the nomads and stuff that are out there around.
One zero - What did you say it was, Charlie?
10,373.0. Man, you can see them out here, I'll tell you.
Are they?
Yeah. I think they are.
Okay, you're looking...
Well, you're looking north.
North, yeah. I see some thunderstorms. Wow! Look at that! The ones there...
10, 37...
Yeah, 10, 373.0.
37.
Okay, check the DAP, Ken.
Okay. You just want me to verify it?
Well, it says load 310.
Okay,...
31 - point 11.
31.0, 0.11.
Okay. 10, 373.0.
That's good. Okay. GDC Align.
Okay.
Do you want to hold off on the power until Carnarvon LOS?
Okay.
We got the Delta-V test and.
I've never seen so many storms.
have a thunderstorm, be usually. The - the thunderstorm.
(Laughter)
I don't. Wonder if that's not one of those fires.
Okay. Set. Did you do a Verb 83?
No. I aligned the GDC.
Okay.
That's really going to be a hassle.
Yeah, I know.
Okay.
Okay, do a Verb 83.
You really want one of those, huh?
I'd.
Yeah, I'm reading the checklist.
We already loaded P15.
Okay.
We got the - we got the ORDEAL Set.
Okay. Trans Control Power, On.
Okay.
And bypass the SECS Pyro Arm.
Okay.
Rot Control Power Normal, two, AC/DC, verify.
Verify.
Rot Control Power Direct, two, Main A/Main B.
Main A/Main B.
Spacecraft Control, SCS, verify.
Verify.
LV/SPS Indicator, S-IVB.
S-IVB.
CB, Direct Ullage, two, close.
You don't want to monitor the - you want to do that??.
Yeah, that's what I was doing.
should be all right.
It goes back to whatever it was, doesn't it?
ought to be able to call.
I don't want to experiment with that, particularly. I don't know whether we ever did or not, to be honest with you, Ken.
Well, I - that's why I asked. That's one that I don't...
I don't remember even ever doing that.
Let's not then.
Yeah.
It's tough when you.
Did you get the Direct Ullage C-breaker, John?
Yeah, I got them, Charlie.
Okay. Set the DET to 51 minutes.
You got them there, didn't you?.
Yeah. DET to 51 minutes. Okay, going to Reset, two hours and four minutes.
It won't start?
Oh.
(onboard): Okay, at 56 minutes, John, we got to change the slew FDAI number 1 to equals 16.
equals 16.
It really isn't like I - I don't know, the way I - I thought it would - would be after. It just feels like I've been here forever.
Yeah, I agree.
I must admit, I feel like I'm.
I don't even feel that. I'm just...
My sinuses are all stuffed up - getting worse.
Mine, too.
I think my nose is, you know, just about to drain...
Okay, you guys, you better start out your belts, because they could get in the way.
Can you...
Not with the seat down, you can't, Charlie.
Well, I'm gonna leave the seat down, okay?
Sure..
Man, that booster ride. I can't get over that. It really felt like a runaway freight train!
I thought that was pretty impressive.
I saw that big flash of flame out that window, and I flat forgot that it was. Man, I thought I'd take this old arrhythmia gauge...
Right. That was pretty bad.
(Laughter) Either that or it'd absolutely stop (laughter). Golly, I was just - I was all prepared for the shock separation...
Is is on?.
I'll go look. I didn't really know that.
John.
I told you I'd forget. Man, I'm forget - I'm in a rapid dump mode. I'm forgetting faster than I. Okay; 25 minutes to go again.
Attitude looks okay?
Looks super.
Man, I can't get over that. (Laughter) I tell you, there are a lot of...
gonna leave them checklists up there during the boost?
Okay, I'm getting to them. My next course of action is to go around and see what I got laying.
Okay, we got a lot.
You want to eat a sandwich, you guys? We got about ten minutes here.
Not me; I'm gonna wait until later.
Okay. I don't want y'all to get hungry and starve..
I'll have to admit, when you get up here - I always thought that EL was kind of a silly but when you get up here, it sure is different.
Sure is.
It just. Don't you guys have a little - little thing on the...
You can't see it?
confuses me. Okay, 10, 272. Right, Charlie?
That's right..
Okay. What's the fuel-to-oxidizer Delta-P?
Hey, could you get me a little piece of tape?
What's the fuel - allowable fuel-to-oxidizer Delta-P with this thing? On powered flight.
On powered flight is 30 - greater than - it's greater than 36; OX over fuel, greater than 26.
Okay.
If LOX goes greater than 50, you want Emergency Sep.
When is the - when does - when does old whatyoucallit predict when we ought to list this stuff down. Write all these numbers down so we, Charlie.
Man, they didn't give me nothing but a pen.
give me Time Base 6.
You know where a pencil is?
Charlie.
Okay, Time Base 6 started at 02:23...
Okay.
Wait a minute; 02:23:57, I think it was.
02:23:57.
02:23:57.00?
Yes.
Okay; and then R-2 align?
R-2 align is 1 - 112.7.
112.7. ORDEAL operate time?
57:20.
57:20? Didn't they change that on us?
That's what it's - that's what's the new time.
Okay. And maneuver to the R-2 ignition would be what?
Okay, 107. ORDEAL of 107.
Okay. And then they said something about data of 17 instead of 16, right?
That's right, at 56 minutes.
Okay..
Okay, and at - and at 57:20, your insured is 11 degrees.
57:20 is 11, right? Okay,11. Thank you. No wonder we ain't never got the right profile. And then they have....
VI is what?
VI is one at 35589.
And burn time?...
05:43.
Okay..
Well, I don't see what's back here that's not battened down. up here; over there.
Well, I'll try to take this camera. How will that be?
Take the camera off?
Yeah. We can put it on.
Okay, going back to 12. There you go.
Okay. We've TLI preparation?
to SECS Pyro Arm.
Can you make a good place to put that Flight Plan there? Guess I could put it there myself.
Right.
Okay...
Well, let's see here, now. Again, we got the CSM/LM Sep breakers.
We do?
Yeah. There we are. SECS Pyro Arm really is a sort of a for docking.
Be kind of terrible.
It's got CSM/LM Sep switch and then S-IVB/LM Sep switch. We got to be very sure we're pushing the right one, but anybody can look at it.
We're going to all look at that, aren't we?
Yes. We're all going to...
Three, 4, and 5 - 5-second hold. Then we're gonna make sure we got the circuit breakers in. All.
Might as well take my water wings off. What'll I do with them?
go?
Right down here. you?
Let me turn the.
Okay,.
Yeah, we - we thought we was supposed to Pro there.
That's okay.
That's low...
I just got a...
get any.
Yeah. all out. I don't know how you're ever gonna make it with that couch in there, if you don't to take the couch out.
One thing about the especially, I got one little minor and that's.
You know, you don't look fat faced to me.
I don't? I feel a little.
It looks like - well, you - you...
What?
Yeah, you look like you're hat.
It's natural.
I mean, but it's not near as bad as standing on your head. That's what I did for two or three days. Stood on there for ten minutes, and, boy, that's about ten minutes. Seemed like about - I'll tell you what's just as bad as standing on your head, though. got a couple or three. Mine keeps going - it keeps...
Keeps going?
What, your sinuses?
Yeah. And then it goes away.
Yeah.
Yeah, I suspect tomorrow.
(onboard): Mine really can drain.
There's nothing else they can do. But the zero g is sure neat (laughter).
Freddie Baker's simulator was never like this one.
Boy, I mean to tell you.
I wouldn't have, if I was.
I hate to tell you, but they don't have any ARIA AOS in this.
It's 02:22 is what he said, Charlie.
I couldn't get my helmet back down in there.. Down under there. There you go.
Okay. Now that's - The only thing we got that I'm a little leery about is the camera.
It's supposed to be mounted there.
Okay. You want to leave it there?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.
Okay, we got the Hasselblad.
Okay.
I've got it up in R-2. And you got the TV monitor. Is it gonna be all right?
Yeah; well, yeah, I think so. It's on the shelf and it's on a big piece of Velcro.
is all in there.
You got the COAS locked.
(Laughter) Man, we're going to the Moon.
Well, we ain't there yet, babe. We got to do it. A couple of things you got to do.
A couple of things you got to do.
I know it. I know it.
And then Casper will be out of his bag.
I'll tell you, if this isn't the cat's meow if I've ever saw it.
You know, I'm getting used to it. My head's not feeling so poorly.
Okay. It goes up and then it goes back down again. Don't ask me how the head compensates for it, because - The sinuses, I don't see how they can ever drain. doctors. It doesn't know it can't compensate.
checklist. G&C Checklist there.
Aw, beautiful. It's got the little card.
You know the - the dadgum - the flow ain't exactly.
I ain't got much flow, either.
It beats me.
Well, the - these extension hoses would make it better, Charlie...
Well, I don't want to do it now.
That's really the only thing.
That's okay. I'll do it after.
I did it. It's pretty comfortable. It's cool. You want me to turn yours off?.
Okay.
How much time we got?
What was Time Base 6 predict?
02:23:37.
Why don't you turn my - could you slide up - go right up there and turn my flow on, Ken.
get the top one.
Okay,.
Can't do it if you don't strapped in.
Okay. EMS Delta-V test, set Delta-V, Direct Ullage, two, close...
Here you go, Charlie.
Up Telemetry to Block, that's Block...
Okay.
EDS Power is On, Charlie. Okay, Charlie; I'm gonna arm the pyros. Charlie?
Wait a minute. You want to put your hose around through there? Okay, go ahead, John.
John, you want to do yours while I'm here?
Nah.
Okay. I'm ready on the pyros.
Okay, pyros are coming on. Pyro A, on; Pyro B, on.
Okay.
THC, it's On. RHC - what do they want to do with it?
Okay, wait a minute. THC - Trans Control Power - we need Rot Control Direct, two, Main A/Main B - should have already had all that.
Yeah. Direct, two, Main A/Main B. Go.
Okay, two - Normal, two - AC/DC.
Go. Spacecraft Control to SCS.
Okay. We got that.
Launch Vehicle Guidance is IU. Translunar Inject Inject. Set DET to 51 minutes. Okay.
Hey, is that Tool E gonna stay up there, John? It's right over your head...
Okay.
Yeah, it'll stay up.
Okay.
I thought I...
Okay, why don't I put it in my pocket. Here, I'll wrap it. I'll put it in my pocket.
We've got an evaporator problem here. No, I guess we don 't.
You've got the radiators on, haven't you?
Yeah..
Here you go.
ARIA...
a little rough there.
antenna. That was ARIA calling.
I know.
think they must be.
Yeah.
Hey, you want to check to see that that's going to be all right.
Yeah, it's alright.
You might make sure that these shoulder straps aren't laying - floating somewhere where they get over your head...
Mine are tied down...
are down.
Okay, because those clips are just.
Okay. I'm gonna set 300 LUNAR on this - to do it.
All right.
Okay, a couple of minutes, you guys.
300 and LUNAR, we got set on it.
We - we got signal strength?
Yeah, a little bit...
Here we go.
keeps babbling, though. locked up yet. We'll let them give us a call.
Okay, Houston, through the ARIA. We got signal strength and - assume you're down there somewheres.
Typical ARIA. Hey, that's a lot cooler, Ken.
Okay, Houston; we don't read anything you say, but we'll transmit in the blind.
Think they're having trouble locking up.
Charlie.
Try them now..
How do you read that down there now, Houston?
Apollo 16, this is Houston through ARIA. Over.
By gosh, loud and clear there.
So are you, John.
Okay, we'll stand by for the light.
What time?
09:38. About a minute.
How's everything on board?
Everything looks good here. We're a minute - we're 10 minutes and 30 seconds to the burn.
Roger.
What's that black thing over there, Ken?
It's your neckband.
Oh..
You got the Flight Plan...
Yep.
All put up.
When is this up-link on? Up-link activity light on?
That?
Yeah.
Okay, that and the S-II light come on at 09:38.
Okay.
Does that Time Base 6 start at 09:38?
Yeah, minus 09:38.
Okay. On time for Time Base 6.
Okay, stand by to start it.
Roger.
You start it on that.
At 9 min - yeah, okay.
Yeah. Yeah, that will be...
This was - this is at.
that was at 09:30 - 5, I get. 36.
Yeah, 36.
Okay.
Come on, boy.
That was on time.
Yeah, that was on time.
Now, I don't understand that...
No, I don't understand it either, but I guess we'll...
Okay, Houston. The S-II Sep light was out on time.
Charlie,...
Roger; very good.
Get this ball lined up?
What, John?
We were off...
Yeah.
on.
Yeah.
Roll is...
Okay, John. Okay. Let see, you can monitor the tank pressures. Nominal LOX, 40; LH2, 31.
148, about?
(onboard): No. No, we're below that, John. 146 - let's say 146.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, now let's go over this thing here. What should I have on...
I got a couple of things for you.
Okay.
OR - DE - A - L - ORDEAL FDAI number l, ORB RATE.
It's ORB RATE, Charlie.
Two, Inertial.
