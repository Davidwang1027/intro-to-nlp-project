Oh, would you look at all that. We could use some helmet stowage bags.
Well, I'm getting them now.
I'll get them. I'll get you the Tool E down if you kind of watch your feet for a second.
I don't even know - I know - What am I kicking?
Well, in just a minute, it'll be me.
Okay.
U-1.
No, they're over here, Charlie.
No, they're over here. The helmet stowage bags?
Yeah.
You're dreaming.
No. They're in U-1.
Yeah, but here's the...
You got - you've got both TSBs and helmet stowage bags to get out, guys.
Yeah.
That's all I need.
Okay.
John, could you move this foot?
Yeah. I don't know where I'm moving it to. I must - Somehow it's... Holy smokes, it's as bad as I thought it would be.
If you put your feet down, I'll get it out of your way somehow. Hang on a second - let me get this flashlight here and see what the heck that is..
In here somewhere is a Tool E.
In L-2.
Yeah.
There it is.
Yeah. Is all the rest of that stuff coming out? We don't it.
Huh?
Take out one thing.
Oh,.
I'd have sworn he was gonna unpack the whole spacecraft.
Okay, I'm going to lower my seat.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey, listen, you gonna have to just take it easy; we ain't really in no hurry.
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't - I think this is absolutely the greatest, but if you you torque your platform.
I'm gonna keep my plat - platform way over standard.
Okay. Tell you what, gang. Could you tell me that our oxygen flow looks good?
I couldn't tell you nothing.
Yeah, it does.
Okay. The flow is less than 0.2 or something like that?
No, it's about 0.3.
Okay, and how's the cabin pressure?
Cabin pressure's holding at 5 - about 5½ (psi, 34-38 kPa). Okay, let me get that. We have the Canaries LOS. Let me do what I'm supposed to do here at Canaries. Getting ready to flow.
Okay, the emergency regs I'm going to put on. They is on Both.
Shift.
Simplex B is off.
John, can you get the Suit Circuit Return Valve Open?
Yeah, I can if I can get back to it.
Okay. Okay - oh, no hurry!
Suit Circuit Return Valve is coming Open. Nyuh-nuh-nuh-nuh.
You got her, huh?
No.
I think you all...
What was that?
RC...
Felt like it took a little Delta-P.
Yeah. (Cough)
Here we fly in comfort though. My - is my hand controller...
Yeah, the RCS Command is Off, too.
Let me do that one more time. The aft is fine, that's for sure.
Yeah, there's some - there's some Delta-V in here.
Okay, how about...
You want your old hat back?
That's all right. Have you got the Suit Circuit Return Valve Open?
Yeah, the Suit Circuit Return Valve is Open.
Okay, and don't want to forget our Window shadem Number 5 there.
Oh, yeah. Charlie...
Oh, yeah. Am I supposed to put that in right now?
Window shade Number 5.
Okay, and I'm gonna...
Okay...
I'm gonna turn the flows off if you want to come out of the helmets and gloves.
Okay, could you put my seat.
Have you done the main reg check?
Let me see. No, we do the main regs afterwards, don't we?
Oh, okay. Oh, I don't know...
Just following my checklist here.
Okay. What could make my feet want to climb up to the...
Isn't that neat?
Yeah. Oh, heck.
You want me to get it for you, Charlie?
Five on the.
No, I got it, babe.
Okay. You want this thing down, John, or like this?
Just out of the way.
Okay.
I just had a...
I do the main regs next, Charlie. We can go ahead and take helmets and gloves off.
Okay, I'm gonna get this...
And...
Window 5 so...
Okay, if you'll tell me when you want to - when you want your flow off, I'll turn it off for you.
Okay. And the Window 5 cover's the one in the bag?
Yeah. UV.
Yes, sir.
You just st - stuff the bag back in there?
Huh? Stuff what bag back in there?
This UV camera...
Oh, for gosh sakes.
What?
I didn't know they had a bag with it.
Yeah. It's so it won't get scratched.
Hey, if you pull your helmet off, it's gonna go.
Where does it go?
Straight up.
Did you shut your air off?
Yeah, but there's still just as much Delta-P in it my nose, I couldn't even see it.
Well, pull your glove off first.
Can you - can you shut my flow off, Ken?
Yes, sir. Here comes your flow off, now.
Okay.
All these snaps.
Man, that do make a difference. Okay, turn it back on, Ken.
All right, Just a second.
I don't know what I'm kicking down there.
Achh!
Ah-ha!
Look at that.
I can't believe it but I got her.
Now, I know.
Here I come.
these things.
Here I come, everybody.
Now - Well - well, be careful you don't hit the thrust switch, Charlie.
Yeah, I know it. I'm trying to avoid that, John.
Course it's guarded.
I keep forgetting you have to hold things.
Well, for some reason, I want to float right up against the instrument panel. Maybe my - maybe it's my helium in my suit.
You want your old dinner bag there, Ken?
Yes, sir; thank you now.
Isn't that neat?
Isn't that neat, the way stuff just floats around?
Ahhh.
That's got to be the world's greatest thing.
I hate to tell you this, you guys. John's got to go potty.
No, this thing won't fit.
Oh, you're kidding me - I hope.
I can't get out of...
I guess I'd better get on with that P52.
Yeah, I guess - Have you jettisoned the covers, Ken?
No. I - I was trying to move too slow, I think.
Okay.
I'm gonna do that next, and then I'll get this stuff. I'll do it.
It's 29 minutes, so we got plenty of time.
Yeah, it won't take long.
What - what all is in the checklist to do between now and tonight? Anything?
No. No, wait a minute. Let me get this thing. There you go it back, naturally.
Oh, come on. My goodness sakes.
the optics coming around?
I figured I was gonna - I stuck Tool E in here where I've been keeping it. And it floats out. I thought I'd just started off the mission by losing Tool E.
Oh, well. There's still...
Okay, let me get us back on the checklist here. Okay, you've done this main - no, we haven't done the main reg check. Okay, install command module - Okay, suit circuit return. And remove helmets and stow. And mount TSBs. I don't have that done yet. But this thing has helmet bags in U-l, but that's not really true. They're over on your side, John, aren't they?
Yeah, here's yours, Charlie.
I - I think it's looking for TSBs out of yours, Charlie, and...
Okay, wait a minute, John.
Okay, just leave it.
Yeah.
It won't go nowhere.
I know it.
That's nice.
Okay, Ken. You can cut my flow off.
All right; stand by. Hey, John, if you want to put your hoses on, I'll cut this baby off again for you.
No, that's all right. I'll leave them where they're at.
Okay.
Okay, cut it back on, Ken. I've got a glove popped yet.
All right, sir; you're on.
Okay. I'm sorry, but the evil winds are blowing again, you guys.
Ain't nothing you can do that's evil right now, babe.
You just got to...
You know something, I never did like this, and I like it even less in zero gravity. I don't know why anybody ain't squawking.
Okay, this baby. G/N Power Optics going On. And Zero Off. Then Zero. Oh, that light.
What's that?
Oh, I got a - a caution and warning on the PGNS. I don't know what that was. Must have been taking it out of the - Mode is Manual. Optics Coupling is Direct, Speed, Hi. Now if up there. The Zero's Off. Go Max speed to the right. The first one that comes off is the sextant at 40 degrees.
I don't believe those.
Ha-ha.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
What's that, John?
Looky here. Well, why don't you get your - well -
Well, darn it. I didn't hear anything come off of the telescope.
Did you see out of it?
No.
Well, keep going.
I was going all the way to the Sun. Shoot. Oh, well...
Maybe you can run it back again.
Yeah.
Maybe you ought to go the other way.
Well, I don't know. If I could...
Are you seeing anything out of the telescope?
No, sir.
Well, but that's going to take awhile. You want to turn down the lights, Ken?
Yeah. I got my lights down here. I'm going to go ahead and do a P52.
Okay, but - okay, but...
You think there is anything wrong with turning the other way if they didn't - if the cover didn't come off?
Well, I think you ought to wait and ask them.
I hate to mess up 52. Let's see - let me - let me get myself good and light adapted.
Yeah, that's the problem.
You want me to turn the lights down?
You want to turn down some of the lights?
I got my eye closed and...
I forgot, the flood's turned all the way up in here. Stars are out there, Ken, I can see them.
Well, I don't see a thing. I heard the sextant go.
Can't you go back to Zero and try it again?
I'm going to. I'm going to Zero and.
We're 90 by 95, you guys.
That's neat.
Okay, you don't see anything wrong with trying to - to do a - Oh, hey, I think I do see some stars now.
There you go.
Oh, thank God.
It takes awhile.
Oh, boy, you do have to be light adapted, I tell you.
Yeah, yeah.
Where? I don't see them. Oh, yeah. There's some, I think...
Hey, I can - They're off because I saw our thruster fire.
I did, too. Hey, that's a thunderstorm down there.
Was it?
Yeah. Must be that.
Yeah, those are down.
I'm looking in the other direction though.
Well, I'm looking on the ground...
Okay.
and that's - that's a thunderstorm.
Okay, I'm going to do a 52 if that's all right.
have to do a 52. That's a.
Okay. I'm gonna...
I haven't got ORDEAL set up, but I got it laying here.
Can I get rid of your thing for a minute?
Okay, there's your flow. The Optics Zero is Off...
What's the - what's the - what should we be doing?
Speed should be Lo; Off.
I'm gonna turn the page here, and...
I tell you one thing you can do is - I'm going to stay in the dark here, so I can see.
Okay.
Would you copy these numbers for me?
Yeah, I'll get them for you. John, we're up to speed, as far as I know.
I haven't started unstowing stuff.
Okay, at 35 minutes.
Oh, we got to do the - we got to do the Main Reg Check, and the secondary Accumulator Quantity.
Man, I tell you what, I - There's another thruster fire.
Okay. John, you want to go to Secondary Glycol?
Okay, would you record star 23?
Okay.
Denebola.
Okay.
I don't - I flat don't think I can see a star pattern at all.
Well, I can out the front here, out the rendezvous window.
But I got a star in the sextant.
What's the name of it?
You didn't see Denebola out the big.
Okay, I did not see a star pattern.
Shoot.
And I'm - I'm well adapted enough in that - but I - I'm sure that the cover's off because...
You can see some stars?
Because I see flashes, and - and occasionally I can see a star, but it's just - you know, you can't miss Denebola.
Well, let me look whenever we get a chance here..
All right. You got any question about whether it's okay to proceed with them?
Heck, no. Go, man.
Okay. Yeah.
Hey, John?
Yes, sir.
We want - we can do a secondary glycol accumulator or loop check - leak check, if you want to.
Yeah. Ken numbers...
Okay, hang on a second and I will. Load it procedure.
This is so great.
Those optics are superb.
Okay, the second star is Number 30.
Okay.
Wouldn't you know. Just what I always wanted.
What's the number?
There it is. Menkent. That may not be in the sextant.
what it is.
By golly, there are some stars out there. One just went by went by. But I'm sure - and I see some of those - Gosh, it looks like the center of the sextant - or the telescope is where I'm seeing. But this thing is - auto optics is just neat as I thought it was.
Man, I can't believe that. I just can't believe our view.
Golly, you're here.
I mean.
Twelve days from now, you won't believe it.
This is fan - You know, I just can't believe how much a thrill this is.
It's really swinging, isn't it?
Oh, man, I've waited...
I mean to tell you.
so long for this.
Just - just look! Look at that! Just hold your cotton picking hand out there in a 70-pound pressure suit, and you ain't got nothing on.
Oh, there's...
That was a good start.
That's a good start.
There you go there, Ken, babe. Look at those torquing angles!.
Whoo, hoo, hoo!
You got those copied?
Wait, 040...
Yeah.
plus...
031.
Plus 031.
Plus 045.
Plus 045. I got them. Give me the DET and I'm ready.
Okay. I'll torque them at 40.
Okay.
Might as well...
Just for kicks, I'm going to do that over again.
Okay...
No, you don't, Ken...
No. Come on.
you don't need to do it again, honest.
Okay.
You're gonna get a blue million of them.
Okay, that - that really feels good.
Yeah. of those EMP.
Because we're liable to have our torquing angles doubled the next time we did it.
That's right. I don't want to know it if it is.
Okay, John, get...
torture.
Give him a...
Tool E?
Give him a Tool E.
Okay.
Yeah. I was going to float myself along underneath there, if you...
I got the ORDEAL up.
You have? Oh, you.
That's I - in my job. It's so easy to do. Too late. Oh,.
You know, I do feel like I'm standing on my head.
I don't. I feel like I've been here all my life.
Yeah, that what comes with 2000 hours under your belt.
Yeah.
Okay, now I need a flashlight to see what the angle is. Okay, when do you want to do this, Charlie?
Okay, let me see. Secondary Accumulator Quantity is at 40. Go ahead, any time for 30 seconds. I'll give you a mark. Give me a mark when you open it.
Okay, going - going to Normal Right?
Yeah. Go to Normal.
Okay; 3, 2, 1...
Normal.
Okay.
It's Normal.
You guys are screwing with my union card.
Let me get out of your way there,...
Okay. I'm gonna go play with the regulators. Okay?
Let's have a sandwich.
Hey, let's get this all cleaned up.
Yeah, let's get it cleaned up.
It's clean as a whistle.
Oh, I want to get these regulators checked and all that stuff that I haven't done. Okay.
Say when you want to shut it off, Charlie.
They're fine. Okay...
Mark.
Okay, going to Bypass.
Okay, it's good.
Bypass.
Loop's good. Okay, we should ECS, and then the Fill valve On.
Okay. I'm turning Main Reg B to Off.
Okay.
Emergency Cabin selector is going to One. All right. How's the flow look?
It's 0.2.
Okay. gonna hit the Press To Test.
Okay.
Did you get some flow there?
A little bit, yeah.
Okay, I may have in a little long...
I think you did. I - Okay, that's it out.
Okay. Go back to Normal?
Not yet. Here it comes.
All right, Regulator B is coming on.
Okay.
And A is coming off.
Okay.
Going to number 2. Valve A Close, Number 2. Away we go.
Okay, it came up a little bit, Ken.
You want me to hold it longer?
That - no, that's fine with me.
Okay. Go back to Normal?
Yeah.
Well, I'm working mine. There's Both.
Okay, I'm going to do - We've been up here long enough. I'm gonna do the fuel cell purge...
There's - Reg A.
And check them out.
Hey, John, do you - did you do that Secondary Leak?
What's that?
Fuel cell - Don't panic. I'm just testing them a little bit.
Yeah, but still - you know.
Yeah.
I don't...
What the heck? I said I was going to do the fuel cell...
Yeah, I know. I knew it. I'm sorry. I don't want anything to spoil this guy now.
Did you do the secondary leak check?
Yeah. It passed.
Yeah, so I can get number 6.
Well, we just floated down there, Ken. It's so easy. Oh, gosh. This has really ruined me for this.
Okay, Purge Line Heater is Off.
What do I do with this Tool E? Just let it sit there.
Okay, I'm going to check the cryos.
Okay, John. I'm going to pass you up some stuff from down in A-8, if that's okay.
Oh, wait - could you wait just...
Sure, man...
Sure.
what is it?
Go ahead.
Throw it to me.
I'll wait.
Okay, I'll - I know some of that stuff has got to be coming over to me, and I'm...
You ain't ready for it?
I ain't r - quite ready for it yet.
I - I - I've got the bracket down there for the camera. Ha, ha, ha.
Okay, check your surge tank pres - Okay, I got that. Cryo fans, Off; on as required. Okay.
Oh, here's the nicest part of all in zero-g...
Fuel cell heaters. Okay, that's...
The container comes out of B-1.
Okay, that.
Yeah, that would be the part.
can, too, and go back in just like downtown.
John?
Yes, sir.
May I present you with a 70-millimeter Hasselblad
Oh, this is as nice as it's always been. That's all I've got to say. Just can't beat all this floating around.
But, in Gemini, you couldn't move around to enjoy it. This has got to be better than that kind of. Phew! Can you imagine what those guys are going to do when they get in Skylab?
Well, I ain't gonna trade with them, I'll tell you that right now.
No, but they are gonna have a ball. When they get that great big volume down there.
How are we going to drink water? That's been worrying me ever since we took off. You got to keep a count of it someway or another?
Well, I don't know. I'll check and see if.
Well, we're supposed to.
If so, it's not going to be any big deal, I can guarantee you.
Hey, how's the systems test look, 5B?
Looks good; okay.
I'm going to hang Tool E around the handle up here. Is that a good place?
Okay, just be sure...
Do you have a place it.?
No, that'd be fine. Just be sure it's snapped wherever you put it. You know, it won't - I already made that hanging mistake once.
Yeah, well, the thing is, it's - the thing around it is really tight, this snap around it.
There must be something I have to do but I don't know what it is.
I think it's the.
Golly, I mean to tell you. If this isn't gonna be the neatest thing that ever was.
Oh, my helmet.
Can't wait to get into that LM.
Yeah.
The thing just for another five minutes and 44 seconds. The pressure's all right - 48 - 38 and 18, Just exactly what they were at that other thing.
For you, my friend, if you'll pull out a - out of that little U compartment down there, the camera bracket.
I already did.
Oh, you - Oh.
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Well, I've got all these cameras, and I don't know what to do with them. It's really neat.
Here, I'll tell you what we'll do with one is raise your foot, right here, to start with. I guess we - I tell you what. You don't really need that guy right now. I can stow it back here in the...
What, the Hasselblad?
In - no, the DAC.
Okay, John. You're supposed to do a - a GDC align.
Okay.
Here, let me stow that DAC.
No, let me just stick it on the thing. It's as good a place for it as any.
It won't be in your way?
No.
Okay. Why don't we - you want to set it while we're about it, then?
Yeah. The T - the...
I hadn't - I didn't set it at all yet.
T - T-8...
Is that - is that APS mod - is that the APS module that's causing all those flashes?
want a T-8, John?
T-8 at l0 feet, right?
Ten feet, 1/250...
1/250, at 12 frames a second.
I just started the secondary coolant loop pump.
Okay.
Good, Charlie.
That's magazine AA.
Magazine AA is what's on there. How about that? Another new...
You're kidding me.
It's really there?
Yep.
Okay.
Can't believe it.
Okay, you got the EL, John?
The what?
You got the Hasselblad?
Yeah.
How about an f/8.
Okay, f/8.
1/250.
Reads 250th.
And...
And infinity?
Well, why don't you take it about ten feet and go - well, put it on infinity for the time being. We might...
Okay, because as we come across the, we might see something. Yeah.
Okay, and that thing just gets stowed out here. Here, I - I put up my little...
I can't do it; they put velcro right here.
my goody bag.
You don't want to do that.
Oh, okay.
It can't get loose unless somebody bumps it.
Well, where did you put it?
Right there. See?
Okay.
Isn't that neat?
Okay. I've got to...
I could have nailed it right up here to this Velcro, but I don't think...
Well, here, I've been using this little goody bag and getting my stuff emptied out of it.
Okay, here come the TSBs you guys.
Old TSB Charlie.
It is so white and pretty.
Kind of like our suits.
Who wants one? Ken, there's one for you.
Okay, I'll be with it in a second, as soon as I get my things put in here.
(Singing) I'll be dancing...
be right in front of us on these, are there? They're all the same.
before I leave.
I don't think there's any difference. I think it's like - like... Okay. Oh, I was gonna put this thing back once you get the CMC up.
Okay, John, here's one for you.
Oh, that's sure nice, Charlie. I'm sure glad you gave me that TSB.
I thought you'd like that.
Okay, how about the...
Aren't - aren't I supposed to put some cameras and mags back in here? In U-l?
Yeah, I think that's yet, Charlie.
Okay. I'll leave it...
I'm taking one last look at my sextant - my telescope here...
Leave it at...
before I screw up on it.
Oh, ho.
I got a star in it now.
Hee, hee. Hee, hee, hee. It got away from me. Come back here, you.
Gosh, this is mag - Oh, look at those pretty stars. Look at that. Oh.
Okay, GDC Align is all we got left.
Okay, Charlie. I'll align the old GDC. That'll be roll 180...
I know, I couldn't be looking at Denebola again, but...
Can you see a pattern?
Yeah, I don't recognize it. It's brighter than heck. It looked like Denebola, but...
constellation is.
I bet it is.
See, the horizon is beginning to light up.
Oh, and I just won me a beer.
What's that?
Well, maybe I didn't here. What's going on?
I'm turning up S-band volume for the...
Oh-oh...
Canaries check.
I wonder.
Okay, Charlie. We got a little roll drift in the GDC and a little yaw drift, but we don't have a heck of a lot of other, and it's - Goldang, it's been running for 50 minutes, and it's off 5 degrees in yaw - 5 degrees in yaw - and we're on Rate 2, so you don't really know. And two degrees in pitch - Heck, I'll take that. And - and 8 degrees in roll for 50 minutes. That's with the BMAGs. That ain't really all that bad.
Oh, I can even see stars now with the reticule turned on. Is it - guess what I got? Antares!
Beautiful.
It even looked like Scorpio. Oh.
Okay, the GDC's aligned behind - to behind you at 51:05.
Mark that down.
So I get a - then I have that we're on Rate 2, BMAGs.
51:05.
Yeah, I'm gonna do some scientific research on this thing with my little pen - unless some dingaling give me a pen.
Okay, I - do you want to do this reference comparison - SCS attitude reference comparison check, John?
Yeah, but I - can we do it until after we've had some...
You've got to compile them.
Oh, okay. That's right. be sure.
Oh, you beautiful. You little beauty. Hoo, hoo.
Okay, there's the comm coming up.
Well, I won me a six-pack.
What's that?
I said that if I went from Manual, that the optics would drift.
Apollo 16, Houston through Ca - Carnarvon. Over.
Hello there, Houston. Read you loud and clear.
Tell them where we are.
You're loud and clear also.
Okay. Okay, Gordy. We're down through - on page 2-17, Ken's done the P52, and everything is copacetic on all the steps up to that point, and I'll let Ken - Well, I've got the numbers here. He marked on stars 23 and 30. It was - Noun 05 was all balls. Torquing angles were plus 040, plus 031, plus 045, and we torqued them at 38:40. Over.
Okay, Charlie. We got that.
And that torquing angle was just super. And you can even see stars.
Very good.
Man, this is really something, Gordy.
Hey, Gordon. Let me tell you a little bit about the ride.
Okay, stand by one, John. We're discussing the booster data here.
Okay. Pressures look good up here.
Roger.
John, this is Houston. If - if there is nothing startling to report about the ride, we'd rather hold off. We're watching - we're evaluating a need for a possible IU Nav update, and also we're seeing some pressure - overpressure in APS Module Number 2. We'll give you a full story on that over Honeysuckle.
Okay, I - No, there's nothing really spectacular different to report on the ride. We'll hold off on that.
Okay.
Can you handle this, Charlie?
Yeah. Yeah, I can handle one of them.
Want me to unstow your panel here?
No, no. Huh-uh. I don't...
do that.
as crummy in zero g as they are on the ground....
John?
Yeah.
Got a that's coming up by your sh - that's your shoulder. Your right? No, going the wrong way. That'll get it. Okay, and here's the UV magazine. It goes over by Charlie.
Okay. What was that? I just keep handing them to Charlie. I don't know what he's...
Well, wait a minute, now. I'm getting my hands full here.
Okay. Well, the UV thing is the one that goes in - goes in that...
Yeah. Okay, John. You hold the camera and pass me the UV thing.
John, you got your hands full?
Yeah. I'll take it.
Okay, I'll wait.
What do you need?
I got two TV cables here.
Oh, heck. I can take the...
All right. The rest of this stuff I'm going to just go ahead and put up in the - in - my little stowage place up here, I think - while I'm here. Don't see any reason why not. Why not? Oh, you're gonna earn your pay today. I know you do good work...
De-de-dum-dum. Do-bee-do-dah-do-beedo - bee-do. (whistling) You're right. That camera did very well without practice.
could have gone all day without telling about that.
Yeah.
That ain't no problem, but those dingalings.
Oh? Why do you say that, John?
Well, I mean, I don't want to know there's a APS overpressure rate. What the heck can I do about it?
Yeah, I guess...
But I - I don't have no gauges to be alert for it, or what? Well, if they want me to take some positive action, like putting on my helmet and gloves, why - they ought to say so, don't you reckon?
Yeah, but I think we - at least, I have badgered them so much about - you know - just looking at something, that maybe...
Apollo 16, Houston through Honeysuckle. Over.
Go ahead, Gordon.
Okay. I'll give you all the story on the APS module problem. Evidently APS module number 2, which is our one on top of the vehicle, the one that would cause you to pitch away from the Earth; the primary helium regulator there has failed to the backup, and the backup isn't regulating properly. Normally, it should hold around 190 psi. This pressurizes both fuel and oxidizer. And it has gradually increased now up around the 320 range. And there's a relief valve which will relieve helium pressure at 325 and reseat when the pressure gets down to 225. There should be a gradual loss of helium. We'll have a better hack at the States pass as to when you could expect a deplete. But should you lose control in orbit, go to the procedure on L2-10 for Service Module RCS control of the S-IVB. Over.
Roger.
Well, Ken, you might have your work cut out for you.
(onboard): It sure sounds that way.
Well, shoot. Now I've got to set up ORDEAL. Can I call Verb 83?
Yes, sir. Go ahead.
Look at that sunrise coming up, you guys.
Oh, yeah?
16, we're just about to LOS. The pressure shows right - in fact, a little bit above the relief pressure. We'll have to wait 'til the States to get a real good handle on how it's gonna deplete. Over.
Roger.
Sunrise out there?
Yeah, it's coming up. See it. On the horizon.
Oh! Oh, look at that! Isn't that - Holy smokes. Have you ever seen anything like that?
beautiful?
Oh.
That is really bright.
Man, that is - Gosh!
Hey, what does that mean to us now, is this - on this APS module.
Data. Get a hold of the - It doesn't need APS for - it needs its attitude control.
Yeah. It doesn't have anything to do with TLI. How do we get our LM? You got your UV shade in the window, have you, Charlie?
Yes.
Did you have any trouble getting it in?
Nope.
You said something about getting it in.
I had it in backwards.
Okay. Because that UV is - is a-coming at us. Okay, I'm gonna start unstowing some Flight Data File stuff - PAD updates.
Man, I think we've had sunrise.
You're right. Look how pretty it is. Now, how do we...
Hey, Ken, where can we put this - the cover for the TV lens? It doesn't have a piece of velcro.
Oh, okay. I'll - I'll put it down here with my optics cover - where I keep my optics in this little pouch.
Okay.
Right down here.
Right.
All the time we saved with that, I thought we would.
Well, I got an idea. We could get - we could do Verb 46, pitch it out of attitude, so it'd have to fire that APS module, and get back in.
Well...
Then it wouldn't.
Trouble is, there's too much backing up determine.
Well, the pressurization looks good. We got to get it down. What - what he's saying really is, we got to empty some of that fuel out of there. Right?
Yeah. What do you think?
Well, like he says - it seems to me what he means is that - is that the thing's just going to deplete the helium in there.
That's. It do seem like helium did that.
Okay, get to those procedures on that page, and tell me what they are.
Okay, that - that would be where? In what?
Flight Data File plus Dr. Spock's baby book.
You're kidding.
Oh.
Would I be allowed to take a picture out here? (Laughter )
You want the spotmeter?
No, I'll Just use it 250, f - f/8 and...
Flight Plan, Volume 1, Data Book. Data we essentially won't need for a while.
Oh,. That's nice.
What, John?
I got the dark slide in.
Dang it.
Oh, you're off to a good start, leader.
Lunar orbit chart.
I got an Earth orbit chart here, but I don't think anybody really cares. Do you?
No.
There's one over there that's supposed to be.
Okay, Charlie. I'm going to give you R12.
Yeah, wait a minute. I got to get this...
Okay. You want me to get that? The last three times, I've been able to just walk up there and put it in.
Yeah, naturally, the flight one doesn't have a color code on it. {Garble].
Hey, that's a - we're not - are we up on the States yet?
No, huh -uh.
No. We're at 01:09. Where does that put us, Charlie?
Hey, your docking probe thing is out over here, your docking light.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey, come on...
Yeah. It stays out.
Okay.
We couldn't be in the States, could we?
Come on.
We're at an hour and 9 minutes.
Where's that? That's darn close.
No, it ain't.
Isn't it? Well - didn't I see some land go underneath us?
No, you didn't.
Okay, Charlie. go in there.
Okay, I'll get that out of my pocket in a little bit.
Okay.
Where are we at, though, Charlie? Does it say?
He talked to us from Carnarvon a few minutes ago.
Yeah...
We're about halfway across the Pacific.
I thought I saw - maybe that was Hawaii. Huh? I thought I saw some land down there.
What the heck? My checklist floated to the wrong page. U.S. AOS (Acquisition of Signal) 01:28.
Yeah, we're a long way from. Is there any ship or anything that we'd be talking to between now and then?
Nope. You want to do this SCS attitude reference comparison check test?
Yeah.
Okay. Verb 16 Noun 20.
Okay,
FDAI Select, 1.
FDAI Select to 1.
Um-mm. FDAI Source, Att Set.
Att Set. Go.
Att Set to GDC.
Att Set to GDC.
Att Set dials, null FDAI 1 error needle.
Okay.
Okay. Okay, and...
Okay, key V - Null the needles. Key Verb when nulled. Freeze display. And then...
Okay, key - key Verb when nulled. Freeze display. Okay -
Mark it.
Okay, give me from the DSKY roll, pitch, and yaw.
Well, I key released it. Let me...
A LM chart? Oh, it's a Duke book.
Yeah, there's a lot of LM stuff in there.
Man, I don't understand why I got an AOT tag. It's not the...
Okay, Verb. Go.
Okay.
179.79.
Okay.
Plus 086.86. That's on the DSKY. Plus 000.78.
000.78. Okay.
Yeah.
What are the thumbwheels?
Thumbwheels say 178.4.
Okay.
Pitch is 088.2.
Okay.
Yaw is 356.2.
What's your time?
Time is - 1 hour, 12 minutes and 45 seconds.
Okay, that's nine at 21-minute check, and we got one degree on roll, got two degrees on - 1½ degrees pitch, and about 4 degrees yaw. FDAI Select 1/2, John.
Okay. Well, tell me what that thing on Page 2 - whatchacallit says, Charlie.
Dash 10.
Okay. Spacecr - Service Module RCS control of S-IVB. Launch Vehic - If APS module failed, Launch Vehicle Guidance, CMC; Manual Attitude Roll, Minimum Impulse.
Okay.
CB SECS Arm, two, close. Auto RCS Select, Pitch and Yaw, Off.
CB SECS Arm, two, closed?
Yeah.
Yeah? Okay get the on this here.
Okay, then we got turn off - turn on - put A/C Roll to Main B, and B/D Roll to Main A. Then RCS Command to On.
A/C Roll to Main B, B/D Roll to Main A.
Want to give me your boost cards?
Why do we do that?.
I'm sorry.
To get - to get commands - to get roll commands. Here - here's one, Ken.
Okay, are you through with that?
Yeah, I'll just leave the landing card up here. Okay?
All righty.
Oh, shoot.
Okay, you want to take it down? I don't care.
I'd like a more positive approach, Charlie. John, you want to give me some of your...
Wait a minute. Let me have the - L - the Boost cards back. It's got the TLI no-go's on it.
Okay. Well, that's - this one?
Yeah.
There you go.
Okay. Okay, then after that, the booster - guy he confir - he commands the burn mode.
These two over there?
Says if that's successful and we get control, the Launch Vehicle Guidance back to IU; we control pitch and yaw with THC, roll with RHC. Allow S-IVB to drift in pitch, gravity gradient. Control yaw within platform limits. Perform normal procedures except Time Base 6 minus 15 minutes, manoeuvre to TLI attitude and set up ORDEAL. Hold TLI attitude until ignition. Null ullage deviations with service module RCS. After ignition, RCS Command, Off. Auto RCS Select, 16, Main A, Main B. Manual Attitude, three, to Rate Command. After cut-off, go back to CMC. Manual Attitude, three, Accel Command. RCS Command, On.
Okay. Well, that's a good thing. I'm sure glad you told me that, Charlie. That - there's the Moon.
Where?
Out the front window.
Hey, John. Would you put my DAC for me, please?
Yeah,.
Okay.
It's awful stiff velcro.
It goes right over the DSKY. Doesn't it fit there?
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! It goes right over the DSKY.
It - I mean, it probably really does.
on top of that little DSKY. It doesn't fit there?
Yeah, it does. And that's coming up.
I can't get my head down far enough. Oh, yeah, look at that. That - Ken, you ought to up here and look at that...
I don't have the time. I'm getting my - last little chore done here. I got - I think I overdid it.
Laughter)
Things are getting out of hand.
Well, let's take it f/11, at 250...
Are getting kind of what?
You think in the middle of the day, we should go to f/11, Ken, or f/8 is still good enough?
Well, I'm just thinking. I've got a little bit of in that.
Well, I think f/11 for this time of day is probably the best you can do.
Okay, we got all the cards we're gonna need now? For TD&E and all that stuff, straight through.
Gosh.
I got the Flight Plan out; I got the G&C Checklist; I got the Surface Checklist available; I got the star charts, I got the TLI cards, got the TD&E card in my pocket. Anything else we'd be likely to need?
Nope.
Here's your antenna card. Why don't you just stick that up?
Okay, thank you my copy.
Thank you.
I think I'm gonna sit down and think some more about that TD&E.
Okay, there ain't nothing we can do about it if that module ain't holding attitude.
If it won't hold in attitude, we'll go get it out of attitude.
That's right.
Looks like it's in attitude now.
Well, it is. I just don't want that little bugger to blow up back there, and get a leak...
That's exactly what I've been thinking all this time. You know, they ain't never said nothing about that.
Well, they got this...
They said they got that relief valve.
They got the relief valve.
Yeah. God willing, when the relief valve comes through, Charlie.
But he said it was over the relief pressure, didn't - already, didn't he?
Something like that...
He said that it was - as far as they could tell, it was right at the relief pressure. How can...
you talking about? We don't have double gauge. We didn't start...
I'm gonna take this thing - little dealy off here. The official ASPO circuit breaker putter-inner. Coming off.
Okay, I've got a stowage place for it, but it's kind of hard to get to right now.
Oh, yeah.
You just want me to leave it on, then?
If it's not in your way.
No, it's not. I...
Why don't we just leave it there until I get a chance to take it down and play with it, because I have a place for it in.
Okay.
It's right on should start.
Apparently, it's just the regulator. But the helium supply...
Well, they're afraid...
off.
I think they're gonna give - afraid they're gonna give out of gas.
Well, that's what I'm afraid of, too.
It won't start up.
Get it in?
What time?
01:20.
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. I said, "The pressure looks good up here." They said, "Well, it ain't your pressure; it's the APS."
Oh.
How's everything up in this old panel look?
Fine, Ken.
This just looks downtown, Charlie and Ken.
Yeah.
Well...
Well.
Well.
Is it ever beautiful.
It is ever beautiful.
Oh, man.
Yeah.
I thought it...
You got it wrapped around.
Yeah.
Hot dang.
Okay. Twist the other one, Ken, because all the going around your back.
Oh, I see what's happened. Yeah.The old put it on one way, and.
What makes the helium pressure - would make it go up?
The regulator failed to open.
Did - did you get a picture of all that good stuff, John? I'm sure we got...
That's 10,000 pictures of horizons and sunrises. I got a picture of the Moon out there coming up.
It's gone.
Going...
coming up.
Supposed to be up.
Okay, here's that's gonna get as about.
Two.
What?
220, you think?
210.
All that right after insertion.
You can extend the docking probe if you want to.
We gonna do that over the States?
Well, they can't tell.
Look under...
Want to hear it go "clunk?" Circuit breakers are in.
Okay.
Take that and put it somewheres else.
Okay, shall we? Extend/Release. Cover.
There it goes.
what it does.
And the cabin pressure didn't go up?
Oxygen flow go up. That's also very nice.
Did you get the through?
No, I just want to make sure it doesn't. Every time I do something mechanical on the spacecraft, I.
Okay. Did you go to...
Just about...
Did you go to Retract?
Okay. two gray, just like they told me. Back to...
supposed to leave it there.
Looks like we leave it in Retract, all right. Talkback gray at full extension. Did all those things. That's all did. (Sigh) Got all that stuff unstowed. And hold us on a hold attitude. That means I got to, damp the rate. If we do it, we'll do it with a - I'll make the turnaround in G&N; then we'll go to SCS - Yes, because with the - the proportional control, I can set up a rate that's equivalent to the one. Okay.
Lift that up.
Well, yeah. Well.
Have to do it.
The thing I don't want to do is that I don't want to be talking about what we're gonna do and - when they're saying, hurry up and get over here before you lose attitude.
Yeah. Did you put the Flight Plans in R-12, Ken?
You should have Volume One in here.
Okay.
Okay. Why don't you pull that out? Well, you remember we talked about it?
Yeah, I remember that.
We went over the procedures on how to dock the thing in...
Yeah.
because you get there faster...
Well, I hate to tell you, but I forgot to hook up R-12, and...
I'll go get it.
It's just floating. Just reach around there, and it will just float right up.
Okay. Sometime here, before we hit the States or something, I sure would like for us to recap the checklist to make sure we haven't left something out.
I've gone over it three times.
Oh, you have?
Yeah.
Okay.
Based on the - our...
Okay, I just wanted to make sure that I - you know, there's some - some of my things that I didn't do because you did, and I don't have all of my stuff checked off, I'm sure.
Okay, you want me to get the Flight Plan out?
Yeah, I wrote some things in there. I think I got some camera settings.
01:28, we come up States.
01:18?
01:28. Here you go, Ken.
All right. Thank you.
(Singing) Dum-do-da-dum-da-dee-do-dee-do-do.
01:26. Sure is quiet up here.
It sure is. Okay, one coming at.
Okay, at 01:30 - Just couldn't believe that these, and I'm already so baffled by these things that I wanted to remember about that I need to do. I was trying so hard to remember times and things; and there just wasn't any way.
Well, I'll tell you, all I was doing was holding on to that ascent.
Man, when that thing started to shake...
Oh, at staging?
No.
No. The...
/Duke (onboard): Lift-off.
Just in general.
Oh, I mean, that's for sure.
Well, it's just like everybody said. They said it's like being on a freight train on a rough track. That's really weird. And when the...
The only thing that I didn't recognize was - there was a little ripple of pogo that kind of built up and died out to - to - to about 09:07 in the S-II burn, and then it quit at - and then after - after the engine shut down, I felt a little pogo.
After the engine shut down, you felt pogo?
After center engine shutdown.
Oh, in the S-II?
Yeah.
Yeah, it quit at 09:05. I remember that number.
Yeah, 09:07.
And it was - Yeah. And it was - the thing that bugged me was that the pogo or the buzz that we got in the S-IV was the same frequency; makes me think maybe that was coming from, not from the booster, but from the understage or something like that. Because it was a - I would have expected to, you know, to get a frequency change, wouldn't you?
I wouldn't even think about it anymore. Okay, there's the coast of - of Baja.
Yes, sir.
Look at him out there ahead.
Look. Yeah, way ahead.
You know that center window isn't too good for that. Charlie, do you want to see if you get to take a pic - picture, or do you think it's worthwhile?
Well, I don't know.
Huh? I got so much junk in the window, I can't do it.
Like my.
Yeah. Very good.
Yeah, give me - give me the camera.
Yeah, well, I got it set up at f/11, infinity...
Okay, how about let's record the - what you take pictures of and things like this and all that and how to do it.
Yeah, well, here comes...
You took - did you just take one, John?
No, I took two, one of which was the - No, that was the - it was the thunderstorm that really attracted me down there...
Okay, that's Baja down there.
Yeah.
Why don't you read off and tell me what you got there, Charlie?
Okay, frame count number...
You got signal strength yet?
Not yet.
You on the right antenna?
now.
Yeah, well, I don't know.
Well, let's do that the first.
Well, we have it - orb rate. We ought to be...
We ought to be on the top one, or we ought to be on B or D.
We're on B.
All right we get it. We get a signal right now.
It's about a minute late.
You got our VHFs going?
No signal strength, huh?
Not a thing.
Look at that. That.
I don't worry about any jet. Let's worry about a little comm here..
There it comes. There it comes.
Hello, Houston. How are you doing?
Be - Let them get locked up, John.
Now you got signal strength; they ain't locked up yet.
Well, it's coming up Max now. Okay, you should have them.
