Casper, Houston. How do you read?
Casper, Houston. How do you read?
Good morning, Casper. This is Houston.
Good morning, Don. How do you read me?
Read you loud and clear. How me?
Loud and clear.
Okay.
Casper, let's put the High Gain to Auto, please.
Go ahead.
And, Casper, as soon as you can, we'd like to go Accept and get a state vector up to you.
You've got Accept.
Roger. Thank you.
Casper, have you zeroed the Noun 26?
Yes, sir.
Okay. Thank you.
And, Casper, I've got about four pages of Flight Plan changes for you. A few of them take effect in the next five minutes or so.
Okay. I'll be ready to copy in five seconds.
Okay. Sorry to rush you, but I just got handed...
That's all right.
...just got handed a fist full of paper here.
I hope it's green.
Go ahead and read; I'm ready to copy.
Ken, give us High Gain, Auto.
You've got it.
Okay. The - I guess the first thing I'd better get to you is at 164:13 [164:02]. We want to manually roll clockwise 40 degrees.
Okay. Forty degrees clockwise at 13.
All right. That's in about 3 minutes away. Actually, there was a TEI-55 PAD 5 minutes ago, but I'll get that to you later.
[Garble] P20 plus-X somewhere here, I bet you.
At 164:16 [164:05], we want to delete everything from CMC Mode, Free, down to GDC align at 164:21 [164:10].
And it's your computer.
Okay. I got that.
Okay. Did you copy the deletion and also that it's your computer?
Yes, sir. Are you not copying me this morning?
I guess - I guess I'm copying intermittently, Ken.
Okay. It sounds to me like I'm keying the - I'll try to talk a little louder.
Okay. I'm reading you loud and clear now.
I have the manual roll 40 degrees clockwise at 13, and I have the computer, Block.
Okay. And did you copy the - the deletion of CMC Mode, Free, down to the GDC align that's at 164:16 [164:05]?
No, sir. I did not. Okay. I'll delete that.
Okay. It might be that I'm transmitting intermittently.
Ken, I want to leave you alone now while you make this roll, but we had a ground station failure on some of my transmission.
Okay. No sweat. I got the Gamma-Ray Gain step back on.
Why don't you go ahead, Don? I'm - I can listen and do this at the same time.
Okay. At 164:18 [164:07], we want to add P20, option 5; plus-X forward SIM bay attitude; 165:32 [164:23], Noun 79, plus 000.50; and set High Gain Antenna, Pitch 10, Yaw zero for AOS acquisition.
Okay. At 18, I want to go to P20, Option 5, to the plus-X; Noun 79 to half degree, Pitch 10 and Yaw zero for AOS on the High Gain, and I want to be there by 165:32 [165:23].
That's affirmative. Okay, at 164:25 [164:14], we want to add a Mapping Camera photo PAD. The T-start time...
Okay.
The T-start time will be 164:35:00 [164:24]. T-stop will be 168:05:41 [167:54].
Okay. Mapping Camera T-start, 164:35:00 [164:24]; T-stop, 168:05:41[167:54].
that's affirmative, and at 164:35 in the Flight Plan...
Okay. Just a second let me mark that up a little bit.
Roger.
Okay. Go ahead. Mapping Camera is recorded, and you said something about 164:35.
Roger. At 164:35 [164:24], we want to add Laser Altimeter, On; Image Motion, On; Mapping Camera, On, at T-start; and you need your Motion, Increase, barber pole/On.
Okay. I'll put the IMC, On. Just before the camera starts, I'll get the Laser Altimeter, On, and after we get it going, the IMC will go to barber pole and On.
That's affirmative. And at the same place in the Flight Plan, you can delete the manual roll clockwise 40 degrees all the way down through the High Gain Antenna, Pitch 10, Yaw zero.
Okay. I got you there.
Okay. At 164:45 [164:34], we want to do a P52, Option 3, and GDC Align.
Okay.
And we'll use the - the same procedure we've been using on that.
Roger.
Okay. At 164:50, we want to delete configure camera...
Okay. Stand - Stand by a second now and let me -
Roger.
Let - let me get this manoeuvre going.
Roger. Understand, Ken. I'll stand by.
Well, that should be close enough for Government work, shouldn't it?
Okay. Yeah, I'll go - I'll go on with the Flight Plan here, Ken, because we are coming up on LOS, and I want to at least get you to AOS. At 164:50 [164:39], they want to delete, "Configure camera for terminator photos" and delete everything down through the "Record frame number" at 165:07 [164:56].
Okay. I got that.
Okay. And at 165:02 [164:51], change that Mapping Camera PAD to a Pan Camera photo PAD, and the numbers to go in there are T-start, 165:07:13 [164:50]; T-stop, 165:39:13 [165:29].
Okay. I deleted all the stuff from 165 down to the record frame; the Mapping Camera; pick up the Pan Camera; T-start, 165:07:13, and stop, 165:39:13.
That's affirmative, and 165:00 [164:49] in the Flight Plan, we want to add Gamma-Ray, Retract, 4 feet. The time is 2 minutes 43 seconds.
Okay: At 165, you want to Retract the Gamma-Ray to 2 minutes and 43 seconds worth.
That's affirmative. At 165:03 [164:52] add Pan Camera at Standby, Stereo, Power, and Operate parentheses T-start.
Okay, I get Pan Camera to Standby, Stereo, and Power, and we'll start her at [165:]07:13 [164:55].
That's affirmative. At 165:10 - 10 - add CSM Experiments/EVA Checklist, solar corona sunrise, Page X 2-11: magazine S-S, magazine H-H, and a note to perform only the camera configuration. We'll give you the times on your next front-side pass.
Okay. What do you mean by you will give me the times? The start times?
Affirmative; and at 165:15 , Image Motion, Increase, barber pole plus 4 steps/On; move that to 165:27 [165:15].
Okay. I copy [garble].
Okay, Ken, if you read, at 165:18, you can delete, "Prepare for orb[ital] science visuals." And we'll try to pick you up AOS for the rest of this change.
This tape can be used in the [garble] sunrise solar corona [garble]. Requires 5 per cent of the DAC film in the [garble] camera. That's gonna start at minus 3 minutes before sunrise, or the equivalent of 4 minutes on the countdown in the checklist. Stand by for start [garble] Four, 3, 2, 1, Start.
That's getting to my peace and quiet.
Casper, do you read, wide beam?
Good morning, Henry.
Good morning.
Don couldn't take any more of that, huh?
They hit you pretty quick this morning, huh?
(Laughter). Yeah. That's a good way to start. Don starts off with a nice little innocuous remark like we have some Flight Plan changes for you. By the way, they start in 2 minutes (laughter).
Roger. Well, how quick can you move? I got another fistful.
(Laughter). I figured you might. Go ahead.
Actually, I'm sorry to hit you with all these, Ken. I know it's a mess, but the PIs are trying to recover as much SIM bay science as they can, considering the changes in the overall Flight Plan.
I understand that. Go ahead.
Okay. You've already beeped the Image Motion. Is that correct?
Ah, no, sir. I got that down here at 165:27 [165:16].
Okay. I didn't know whether you'd gotten that change or not. Okay. We'll go by that. We want to delete the orbital science for this rev, so you can delete that little line there at about 165:18 [165:09] where it says prepare. And at 165:30 [165:19] at the top of the next page, delete Pan Camera, Standby, and Power, On. And down at 165:35, delete the Pan Camera Power, Off, MSFN cue. Okay. Let me update your times, here. At 165:31, where it says Mass Spec, Retract, to 20 feet, the new retraction time is 33 seconds. And at 165:35, retract to 15 feet. The new retraction time is 30 seconds.
And that 30 seconds is - is starting from where I stopped at 165:30. Okay?
That's affirmative. And delete the Colombo Highlands and obs- visual observations there. And in its place, add "Pan Camera, Standby, T-stop; Gamma Ray, Deploy; Pan Camera, Off, MSFN cue. And, Ken, we're gonna move these next two Mass Spec retractions up a little bit and start your eat period earlier so we can cut it off earlier. But we'll do those real time. There's no need of scribbling up the Flight Plan. I'll just give you a call when to do it. And at...
I think that's a good plan.
...165:50 [165:39] there, delete that Image Motion, Increase, barber pole/On.
Okay.
And at 165:50 [165:39], we'll start your eat period. And at 166 [165:49], down at the bottom of the page, delete Mass Spec, Deploy.
Okay.
And in the interest of keeping your SIM status correct, at the top up there at 165:30 [165:19] the status should be plus 1211 and all twos.
Okay.
And on the next page, at 166 hours [165:49], SIM status in the first row is plus 1121, and the same holds for 166:30 [166:19].
And, Casper, could you give us barber pole plus 4?
Okay.
You have it.
Okay. Going back to the Flight Plan, at 166:45 -
Okay.
You can make that end eat period. And immediately following, prepare for solar corona sunrise photos. And the T-start for those photos is 166:52:45.
Okay. T-start for the solar corona is 166:52:45.
That's correct, Ken. And on the next page, 167:01, add "Laser Altimeter, Off; then P20, option 5, for 40 degrees south oblique; Noun 78: plus 270.00, plus 087.75, plus 180.00." And the Noun 79 is 0.50; set High Gain, Pitch 10, Yaw 350 for AOS acq."
Okay. At 167, it's Laser, Off; P20, Option 5, 40 degrees south oblique; Noun 78, plus 270, plus 87.75, and plus 180; Noun 79's a half degree, and it's Pitch 10, Yaw 350 for the High Gain.
Roger. And at 167:05 [166:54], starting with Mapping Camera, Off, delete everything through Enable All Jets down to about 167:14 [167:03].
Okay. It's including Mapping Camera, Off, down through including Enable All Jets. That whole block is deleted.
That is affirmative. And in the next line, change the Yaw for the High Gain to the 350.
Okay.
At 167:22, delete the Verb 48.
Let me see. Am I supposed to be retracting that - Hey, Hank, am I supposed to be retracting that boom now?
Roger. You're about 30 seconds from it. Why don't you go ahead and do that, Ken?
Okay. Well, let's do that thing and get it - get something done on it, because I'm gonna have to watch it.
That's a 33-second retract time.
Okay. It's in work, and I'm watching it.
Okay. It's Off.
Okay. Could you give us Auto on the High Gain?
You have it.
Okay. And, Ken, getting back to that Flight Plan, there's only one more change that - at 167:30 [167:19] -
All right - go ahead.
We're deleting the update block.
Okay.
And that ought to get us through another rev. Do you have your Noun 93s from your P52?
Yes, sir. Let me look back here and find them. Okay. They were minus 0.103, minus 001, plus 0.097. And I torqued those at 164:47:20.
Roger; copy.
And, Ken, I have a TEI-55 block data.
Okay. Just a minute. Let me get my other book. Keep an eye on the clock there. I got another retraction and a Pan Camera to worry about there.
Roger.
Okay. I'm ready to copy.
TEI-55, SPS/G&N; 38144; plus 0.67, plus 1.05; 182:37:26.53; plus 2864.2, plus 0396.6, minus 0096.9; 181, 095, 010; the rest is NA; Sirius and Rigel; 131, 029, 016; two jets, 17 seconds; longitude of the Moon at TIG minus 159.03; assumes LOPC-1 and lift-off REFSMMAT. And it's time for the boom retract to 15 feet.
Okay. I'll get the boom, then I'll read it back to you.
Okay. And this is a 30-second.
Okay. Thank you.
Now, it's coming in.
And it's Off. Readback: TEI-55, SPS/G&N; 38144; plus 0.67, plus 1.05; 182:37:26.53; plus 2864.2, plus 0396.6, minus 0096.9; 181, 095, 010; Sirius and Rigel; 131, 029, 016; two jets, 17 seconds; lambda, minus 159.03. This PAD's based on Flight Change Number 1 and the ascent REFSMMAT.
Good readback, Ken.
And real quickly here on the SIM status, Mapping Camera's perking along real good; 98-frame margin. The Laser Altimeter now is getting about 65 percent, good altitude. We've had 1431 firings. Pan Camera is overexposing by one and a half f-stops, because of a bias in the exposure-command voltage. We're 47 frames ahead on that. The rest of the SIM bay apparatus is working real - nominal.
Okay. Has the X-Ray experiment detected anything that looks unusual about the Descartes area, or anything like that?
Okay. I'll see if I can get a reading on that.
Casper, you're coming up on about 15 seconds to T-stop Pan Camera.
Okay; thank you.
It's Standby.
The Gamma Ray [boom] is on its way out.
Roger.
Verify that that's the gamma ray, Ken. We show the Mass Spec [boom] going out.
Oh, thank you.
There goes the Gamma Ray [boom] out. You want me to go out and time the Mass Spec back in, so you'll know where it is?
Okay, Ken. What we'd like for you to do is take the Mass Spec all the way out and then retract it for 93 seconds.
Okay. That sounds reasonable. Going all the way out and back in for 93.
That's affirmative. And that would get us back to the 10-foot point that I was just - just getting ready to call you for.
Okay. I'm gonna bring the Mass Spec boom in now.
Okay, Ken. 93 seconds.
Okay.
Okay. Your Mass Spec is Off.
Okay. And we're ready for Power, Off, on the Pan Camera.
Okay. Pan Camera Power is Off.
Have you had time to work up a crew status report yet, Ken?
[Laughter.] In between the other things? It's a short one. It shouldn't take me a second.
All right. Take your time; I was just trying to get all this dirty work out of the way so you'd have an uninterrupted eat period.
(Laughter). Uninterrupted only by [the] solar corona [observations]. Okay. About PRD, 15054; 7 hours; and none. And yesterday - let's see - well, shoot! They don't even have Meal A in this book. I don't know why it's split this way, but - You can delete the - Well, the only thing I had out of Meal B that's on the list there is the graham crackers and the cocoa. I also had bacon squares, coffee, and some of that pineapple fruit cake, and an apricot bar, and orange juice, and another package of graham crackers spread out throughout the - the day. Meal C: You can delete the beef steak, and the chicken and rice, and the pecans. And you can add that lobster from Meal B.
Okay, Ken. We got that.
Okay. That should finish that - fill in that square, okay?
Hey, Ken? How's the air-to-ground been this morning? Has there been a lot of noise on it, or it's been clean to you?
Just as quiet as ever. Beautiful comm.
Okay.
Casper, Houston. Could you give us Retract on the Mass Spec boom, 20 seconds? That's a change, 20 seconds.
Okay; this is 20 seconds.
Coming in now.
It's Off.
Roger.
Hank, where is that extra crater that you said you had down. there?
What was that, Ken?
You said something about an extra crater down there. Aw, I've lost it now.
Oh. That was between Double Spot over where the LM was and down to the south there towards Stone Mountain. As they were coming back from the surface, it was very apparent there was a very large depression, a subdued crater. There was a - some - they estimated 300 meters, maybe even larger in diameter.
Okay. I guess I looked in the wrong place. I looked short of the landing area.
Henry, do you remember the little helmet-shaped...
Yeah.
...area we had just south of the Riphaeus Mountains?
Yes, sir.
They showed up in the color differentials. Well, it does have a different color to it. It's - in this sunlight, it seems like these - the things that were showing up on - those red-and-blue color differences - they're showing up more in the low-Suns. Because I can see the mare differences back by Lassell in low-Sun. And they don't show up so well now. And now this one shows up very dramatically as this little - little piece of [garble] out here. And it's kind of - it's just a little tanner than the rest of the mare.
That's a little - kind of interesting to find out that the color's different there than the surroundings.
Yeah, and the texture is a little different, too. I got the binocs on it now. The mare has a large number of very small pits in it, as well as a - it's almost a random distribution of crater sizes. This little patch of ground has - oh, I guess about the same distribution of the larger craters, but the little pits don't show quite as much. It's a - it has a ropy texture across the top, not - not as ropy as a - as a pahoehoe flow or anything like that, but just kind of has a little pattern to it. It has some lineaments that run kind of - I guess that's sort of northwest. And it looks like it may be associated with these other little clumps of material that stick out around it here. And - I was trying to compare that to the Riphaeus Mountains, and it looks like - the material looks the same. And another thing I'd never noticed before that looking at the Riphaeus Mountains here - I'm looking at the - at the step of the - let's see, this eastern edge. And if you're - remember that back around Flamstead there's a little foot, a little toe or ring that goes around the inside. And the Riphaeus Mountains all have that little toe. Now whether that's a high-water mark or a second unit, it's hard to say. But all along the margin that I can see - there's that little toe. And it seems to be at the same elevation. And that's true for some of the little patches a little further back - back inland. It looks like a break in slope and a changing color both.
What else do you see in there?
I see that it's getting dark outside, and it's time for an eat period inside.
(Laughter). Roger.
No, it's an interesting place, you just need to have more time to look at it.
And I'm all set up for the solar corona. The cameras are all set. The checklist is complete down to turning the tape on.
Roger. Why don't you take time to eat then, and - I'll just check out with you at AO - at LOS.
All right, sir. Thank you.
Maybe everyone else in the world knew about that little toe in the Riphaeus Mountains. I just never had heard anyone mention that before.
Roger. That sounds interesting.
Farouk and the boys in the backroom have been eagerly absorbing your remarks the last couple of days.
Yeah, but all the questions they ask, I can't answer.
You know, Hank, one of the things I was thinking about last night that might help remember a lot of the things we've seen - do you suppose there's a - any DAC film that I can use to, say, set to look out the window? And I'll see if I can maybe just tape the DAC up somewhere and let it take a one-frame-per-second strip, or something that would give us some reasonable overlap - around the lighted part of the Moon.
Okay, Ken. We'll take a look at that.
I think I could probably tape the camera somewhere so it would have a - a view approximately the same as what we've been seeing.
Casper, no need to acknowledge. Your consumables look good, and, on the RCS, we're making a little money. We're about 188 pounds now above the rescue red line.
Okay. That sounds good.
Henry, are the surface guys out cranking up their little car yet?
Yes, sir. They got out about 30 minutes early, and they are moving on out.
Casper, Houston. John and Charlie are powering up the LRV now, and FAO says you're cleared to use magazine EE and KK. At the present, they are on schedule.
EE and KK. Okay, what kind are they? Are they CEX?
Both of those are CEX.
Okay. And I'll just use the settings off the photo wheel the same as we use for the 250.
That ought to work out okay, Ken.
Okay. Thank you.
Casper, we have been noting a little oscillation in the high gain at acquisition, and we were wondering if you're still noticing that discrepancy between the angles and the knobs when you're in the manual mode. It appears to us that it may be off a little bit in yaw.
Okay, I'll - I'll set them on the - I've been setting them on the dials rather than on the knobs.
Right. That's preferable - to use the meter there.
Okay.
Is that dial for setting the yaw - is it loose?
No. No. Huh-uh. It just has that bias. It had it during - I guess it was the last time we were out there in the bird before flight for some test, I noticed that it had a difference in reading. I can't remember now what the occasion was, but I know that - that - that the biggest error is in the pitch channel rather than in the yaw channel.
Okay, we copy.
Do you have a procedure you'd rather have me try at acquisition to help out?
Okay, if you see the signal strength oscillating a little bit, I guess the best procedure is to go to Wide and wait.
Okay.
Casper, we are about 3 minutes from LOS. Everything is looking good. The laser has degraded a little more, but other than that, everything is okay.
Okay. I'll see you on the other side.
All righty.
Hello, Houston. Are you there?
Hello, Casper. How is it going?
Oh, pretty good. Got our solar corona done, and we got a little 16-millimeter strip [garble] - Unfortunately, I missed the first couple of minutes while I was changing mags, but you're pretty close to a full rev. This has turned out to be a - I was looking through the Flight Plan to see a good rev, and it looked like this one has the hatch window pointing almost straight down; it's probably the best rev we got going.
Okay. Did you see anything worth talking about up there before AOS?
No, sir. I spent all my time getting the camera set up.
Roger. John and Charlie are at North Ray now, and, boy, is that a big hole.
Did they have any trouble getting up there? I guess not.
Negative. They whizzed right on up there. Unfortunately, they are not in a position they can see the bottom, and it looks like they might have to fall in it first.
Well, let's not get that picture.
Roger. And also a surprise. They didn't see any evidence of bedding in the crater anywhere they looked.
I don't see any from here, either, it looks like a little slumping, but that's all.
I guess those little things we saw in the photos just fooled us. It turns out that that little black spot on the east rim that was in the photo was really there. It turns out it's one huge dark-colored rock.
Is that right? Wonderful. They're going to chip it and get a piece out of the center, huh?
Well, we wanted them to turn it over, but they decided against it.
Did they make any comment on what the material looked like on their drive up to North Ray?
Most of it appeared to be breccia; however, they did pass one that was a frothy looking thing that - we probably saw our first basalt.
Well, it still looks like to me that path that they drove up on is part of all that furrowed Descartes unit.
Hank, would you give me a call at time 39 please?
Okay. Will do. And could you give us Auto...
Thank you...
...for the High Gain?
...stopped again. You've got it.
And, Ken, if you like, I can go ahead and read up your plane change PAD.
Okay, let me - let me do a couple more cleanup chores and I'll be ready to copy.
Okay, and they are just putting on the finishing touches on the Flight Plan change.
Okay.
Casper, if you will give us Accept, we'll send up your state vector and target load.
Okay, you have it.
My water spout looks like a Christmas tree ornament. It's actually very pretty. It's got a nice big bubble of water about an inch and a half in diameter sitting there on it, just looking at me. And it's just as round - it looks like the cartoons of the - the Jello that all the little mice play in.
Roger.
And, Hank, I took a couple of pictures on frame ZZ; that's frame numbers 22 and 23, of that water bubble, so the folks can see what we're talking about when we say that - that gas separator has a big bubble on the end of it.
Roger.
Casper, the computer is yours.
Okay, be with you - Okay, that's in Block. And do you remember the guys - I think the folks from Marshall - saying that they thought if you had bubble of water and you hit it with another bubble in zero g that one bubble ought to go through the other one?
Roger.
It seems like they said something like that. I don't remember all the details, but I thought there was a good chance. I had one bubble, I'd try a second one. And I put the water gun on it. And from where I was standing, I really couldn't see all the dynamics; but it looks to me like it splashed out the back side, and the bubble was still intact on the front. Now whether it went through or had a reflection and bounced off the - the other side, I can't really tell. It did develop some air bubbles inside of the big bubble. So there may be some interesting dynamics there.
Hey, that sounds real interesting.
Okay. I got my toys put up now and I guess next thing in order is to copy a little plane change PAD, huh?
Roger. Are you ready to copy?
Yes, sir.
Okay. LOPC-1, SPS/G&N; 38585; plus 0.45, plus 1.02; 169:17:39.49; minus 0001.5, minus 0124.7, all zips; attitude is all zips; 0 pitch - roll, pitch and yaw; Noun 44, 0064.5, plus 0055.3; 0124.7, 0:07, 0113.0; the rest is NA; Sirius and Rigel; 197, 240, 301; two jets, 16 seconds; quads Bravo and Delta; other, HIGH GAIN angles for AOS and burn altitude, Pitch; plus 13; Yaw, plus 258.
Okay. I copy LOPC-1, SPS/G&N; 38585; plus 0.45, plus 1.02; 169:17:39.49; minus 0001.5, minus 0124.7, all zips; attitude is all zips; 0064.5 plus 0055.3; 0124.7, 0:07, 0113.0; Sirius and Rigel; 197, 240, 301; two jets for 16 seconds on quads Bravo and Delta; High Gain angles at AOS, Pitch plus 13, Yaw plus 258.
Good readback, Ken.
Hank, we didn't say anything about this Verb 48 at 167:20, but I assume we meant to delete that.
I called that up to you, Ken. I thought you got that. You acknowledged it.
Okay. Well, that's another on my score, then.
Casper, we done passed your 39. It's 40 now.
Okay. Thank you.
Sorry about that.
Ha, that evens the score.
Roger.
That's not fair. I was really going to - I really did forget, because I was going to engage you in some verbal discourse to distract you so that you would let me forget it and I could redeem myself.
Roger. I had - I had a diversion down here. We're fighting the Flight Plan.
And, Ken, we'd like to get your Flight Plan update up to you, and would you prefer to do it after your visuals or start on it now?
Oh, let's see. How much time have I got? Probably I'd just as soon start now.
Okay, why don't we get going with it then? Okay, the first - the first change comes at 168:05.
Okay.
At 168:05, Mapping Camera, Off, T-stop; Verb 49 maneuver to P52 attitude; that attitude is 142, 250, 042. Mapping Camera , Standby - that should be 30 seconds, about the time you do that maneuver; Image Motion, Off.
Roger.
Laser Altimeter, Off - and that's a verify; Mapping Camera, Retract; X-Ray, Standby; Mass Spec Ion Source, Off; Mass Spec Experiments, Standby. And there is a caution: wait 5 minutes before Retract; Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover, Closed; Alpha Particle X-Ray Cover, Closed; Gamma Ray, Retract; Mass Spec, Retract: enable all jets.
Okay, just a second and I'll read it back to you.
How about if I read that back to you after I pass the landing site?
Okay.
Is that going to crowd us for time? You've got a better feel for it than I have.
I don't think so, Ken, if we can get right on it right after the visual.
Okay.
Ken, John and Charlie are still at North Ray and they have found some basalt clast.
Very good. Around the outside or up on the rim?
Roger. They are still on the rim.
The thing that I find most puzzling about North Ray is that the albedo comes up - and I can see - as the sun comes up the albedo change shows some, but I can see the rays around there a lot better now. And the rays lay on top of that material that seems to run, that they drove up on. Well, I take it back, it looks like there's a little tongue of that material that's probably about where they drove. It doesn't appear to be as white as the stuff just a little bit further to the east. But all that material down to the east and all the stuff that goes over - goes over to Ravine all look like the same stuff and looks very similar in character to Smoky. I see no evidence of rays in North Ray except for some blocks on the sides there, probably just slump blocks in slump patterns. And taking a quick comparison with South Ray, the - I'm not so sure South Ray is much different. Okay; I'm ready to go back to copying updates.
Ah - Roger, do you want to read back what we had there for 168:05?
Okay. Let's see - 168:05. Okay. I wanted to question - I had a T-stop time for the camera of 05:41, and you just gave me 05. Do you want me to stop it at that, or do you want me to go on to -
05:41 is the correct stop time. We just - this is just putting in words what goes along about that time.
Okay. And then Verb 49 to a P52 attitude, which is 152, 250, 042.
Correction on that. That's 142.
Mapping Camera to Standby. What did I read to you, 142, 250, 042?
That's correct.
Okay. Then it's Mapping Camera to Standby. That's at 30 seconds after we get Off. Then IMC, Off; Laser Altimeter, verify Off; Mapping Camera, Retract; X-Ray to Standby; Mass Spec Ion Source, Off; Mass Spec Experiment to Standby; wait 5 minutes before retraction; then I can go ahead and close the Mapping Camera Laser Altimeter Cover; the Alpha X-Ray Door can be Closed; the Gamma Ray can be Retracted and after the 5 minutes I can retract the Mass Spec. Then I will enable a couple of thrusters.
Good readback. At 168:15 H2 Purge Line Heaters, On; P52-
Okay 168 - wait a minute, say that again, Henry.
Roger, the H2 Purge Line Heaters, On at 168:15, and following that a P52 Option 3, and then an Option 1. You are going from the landing site to the burn orient.
Okay, that will be an Option 1 and then an Option 3.
That will be Option 3 then Option 1.
Okay.
And just a reminder to use SCS for that, I guess you got that down as a standard procedure now.
Okay. That's a good reminder nevertheless.
Well, what we are going to do here, Ken, is we're going - you're going to have to get a scratch pad now - we're - there's just no place in the Flight Plan we can do this conveniently. And we'll just give you times and things to do, and fill in the gap between 168:30 and 172:30. And if you want to do that, get your pad out. I'll read these things to you.
Okay. I got a pad. Do you think we know enough to - right now that it'll pretty much sequential or do we need to leave spaces for alterations? You know, we got some of those real-time checklist sheets in the Updates book, let's see if that is appropriate.
I think that's probably a good thing to use. And Ken, I think we got a pretty good handle, too, on what should happen in sequence, so you wouldn't want to leave too many spaces.
Okay. Well, we got lots of these Flight Plan update sheets, so why don't I use them? And I'm ready. Let me mark this so I can always find this page. Just a second before you read it to me.
And, Ken, we don't plan to update your platform before the burn, just the affirmation.
All right. Okay. I've got my paper in hand. Ready to copy.
Okay. Time 168:30, configure for urine dump; 168:37, P30; Verb 49 maneuver to LOPC-1 attitude.
Okay.
168:40 H2 and O2 fuel cell purge, waste water dump, and urine dump.
Okay. And you want me to dump them both at the same time, right?
That's affirmative. And 168:...
Okay.
...50 terminate waste water dump at 10 percent and H2 Purge Line Heaters, Off.
Okay.
Okay. They couldn't work that Mass Spec dump in there, Ken. They tried, but they couldn't. 168:55, pre-SPS SIM prep; set DET counting up to LOPC-1; secure equipment for LOPC-1
Okay.
At 169:05, P40; at 169:13, AOS and that will be those angles you have, pitch, plus 13; yaw, 258; at approximately 169:17 is LOPC-1. And we hope we'll have a good lockup, but it's only about 4 minutes, there, and we hope we'll be locked up so we can watch. At 169:20...
Okay.
...P00. Okay. And, also, I guess I should tell you, you can use the burn table for that LOPC burn. It's on page 223 of the Flight Plan. That's got all your burn rules and so on.
All right. Let me check that real fast.
Okay. Those look like familiar rules.
Okay. And at 169:25 we'll up-link you a liftoff REFSMMAT, and at 169:30, your post-SPS-burn SIM prep, and that still leaves a gap there of about 3 hours, and that's your - after LOPC-1 we don't want to clutter up until we get through with that. But we'll go ahead and give you the rest of the things that fill in here.
Okay. I'll still need the - plenty of time to get the cockpit squared away for rendezvous.
We plan to give you lots of time for that, Ken. Do you want to read back what you got there, just to make sure we agree?
Yes sir. Let's see. Have we got anything coming up here that we are supposed to be watching before I read it back?
I'm watching your Mapping Camera.
Okay. I'll read back. 168:30, configure for urine dump; 37 to P30, Verb 49, the Lunar Orbit Plane Change Number 1 attitude; at time 40, hydrogen and oxygen fuel cell purge; we turn Line Heater On back here at 168:15. Okay, at 40 we also do waste water and urine dump; at 50 terminate waste water dump at 10 percent, and turn the Purge Line Heaters Off; 55, pre-SPS SIM prep; set the DET counting up and secure equipment; at 169:05 it's P40; at 13 it's AOS, with a Pitch 13, YAW 256.
That's 258.
At 17, it's plane change 1, 258. Okay. I got that on the other PAD, too. All right, at 17 it's plane change 1, I use the burn rules off of page 223; at 20 I'll go to P00; at 25 you give me an up-link of the ascent REFSMMAT; at 30 I'll do the post-SPS SIM prep.
Roger. And I guess there you will use your modified burn card with a 509 et cetera.
Okay. And I'll start the 509 right after my P52.
0kay.
Then do an SCS; then I'll call 509; and then I'll take 509 down and I'll use the modified card where I start at gimbals - bring the bus ties on at 8 minutes.
That's a good plan, Ken, and the - where we are going to pick up the Flight Plan again is at 168:30, to start preparing for rendezvous, and from 168:30 on to 175 hours, if you add 4 hours to all of those times, they're close enough that we can use them all the way through the rendezvous.
All right. That's a help.
In other words, 168:30 becomes 172:30 and so on down the line all the way through, and even the lift-off time is within a minute or so. You always get an update on that anyhow, so this section of the Flight Plan will be good.
Okay. Swing. All right sir. I guess I got my work cut out.
And, Casper, you are about 15 seconds from T-stop on the Mapping Camera.
All right. Thank you. And it's Off.
Okay. Our - manoeuvre is underway, Mapping Camera is coming to Standby, the IMC is Off, it's barber pole at gray, the Laser is verified Off, Mapping Camera is coming to Retract.
Mark.
The X-Ray is at Standby, the Mass Spec Ion Source is Off. Mass Spec Experiment is in Standby.
Casper, we're showing a Retract on the Mapping Camera. Does that agree with you?
I'll check; just a second. Yes sir. That's about 3 minutes and 30 seconds or so.
Roger.
Okay. Here comes the Alpha and X-Ray Door. They're closed, and Altimeter's Off, the Camera's in, so here comes the Camera and Laser Door. That must have been in; the door closed. Okay. The Gamma is coming to Retract, and I show it's been 6 minutes, so I'm gonna bring the Mass Spec to Retract, too.
We concur.
Okay. Then we'll start on my P52. Got the Purge Line Heaters- On a minute early so I won't forget those. Okay, I'm in SCS control and I'm gonna call P52.
Roger.
I must have one of the planets right up there above, right in that area, too. Does that sound right? That's around Nunki.
Well, we'll take a look.
(Laughter). Okay. Back and do an Option 1 now.
Roger.
Okay. I have these numbers if anybody wants them.
We got them.
Okay. I don't think those are worth torquing, are they?
Negative.
Yes, you have Jupiter in my field of view, and all his little moons.
Roger.
He sure must be a longs ways off, because even now he's not very big. You can see his moons, though. That's about all you can tell from it - tell who he is.
Okay, Ken, before LOS here, after you exit that 52, we'd like to check your boom talkbacks.
Okay. Stand by, and I'll be with you. Okay. I've got -
The CMC Mode on the Optics on Zero to resolve - All that's put to bed. I'm going to start the 509. I'll look at your talkbacks first. Oh, now I've got 2, I got 2 of these things that show barber pole. Both the Mass Spec and the Gamma Ray.
Okay. We show that both booms are not fully retracted; however, we do show them past the point where it's safe for an SPS burn. So we'd like for you now to take the Deploy-Retract switches on both of those to Off.
Okay. They are safe for burns. I guess we ought to try that in sunlight.
Okay, Ken. We're about 3 minutes from LOS.
Okay. We - go ahead.
In case we don't get comm before the burn, and at this point you're Go for the burn, the only thing you haven't done is look at your target load. You still have to enable the jets, according to the Flight Plan, and when you do your pre-SPS burn card on the SIM Bay, you'll be turning the Alpha Particle and X-Ray Off and going to Boost on the Pan Camera.
That's affirmative.
And, Ken, be sure you load your DAP before you load 509.
Wilco. I was gonna try to let you take a look at the vector P40 before we got to LOS.
Okay.
Okay. You've got it.
You had a good vector, Casper.
Okay. And I've got the DAP loaded.
Servo Power 1, AC1, Servo Power 2, AC2. Rotation Control Power Normal, Number 2, AC; Direct, two are Off. BMAGs are uncaged; 2, 3 uncaged. Going to SCS. RHC number 2 is armed. Here comes Gimbal Motor Number 1. Pitch 1 -
Mark. Good start. Yaw 1 -
Mark. That's a good start. The trim thumbwheels work - both directions - on Pitch, 7.48, 1.5. I can tell the difference. Yaw thumbwheel works in both directions set on plus 1 - 02. Okay. Pitch, MTVC; Yaw, MTVC is good. Okay; back to CMC; then go back to zero. Going clockwise. Start, Pitch 2. It trims, and MTVC. Back to neutral. I have no MTVC, Pitch and Yaw. Then back to zero. Rotation Power Number 2 is AC/DC. Direct Number 2 is Main A/Main B. Let's see. We'll take a manoeuvre and see if it gives us one. It does not. The gyros - I'll just sort of cage them to bring them up to speed and back to uncage. TVC looks good. Enter the 204. Pro[ceed]. It's a plus 2 in pitch, minus 2 in pitch, zero; plus 2 in yaw, minus 2 in yaw, and zero. And it's trimmed. I'm out of 204. The Rate switch is going to High; the Scale is 5 at 1. The DSE is running. Okay; we're going to terminate 509. That's Verb 48 Enter, Verb 21 - and I want that to be a 10101. Verb 25 Noun 7 Enter, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, 0 Enter. I will now take down the 509 flag.
And it's time to strap in my trusty machine. A piece of bread I don't need in my face.
Do not yet have Yaw Gimbal Number 2 on. But I will bring it on in just a minute.
Okay; I'm going to bring Yaw Gimbal Number 2 on.
Mask. Direct Ullage breakers are 2, In. Okay, we're at 3 minutes and 9 seconds. I'll go to Vox at - 2 minutes. Let's see, it should have Houston here in another minute or 2.
I am indeed going sideways, so I must be doing it right.
Hello, Houston. How you doing?
Hello, Casper. How's it going? Are you all set up?
All set to go. 509 is out, I'm in attitude, and we must be right, I'm going sideways.
Roger.
Counting down at 155. I'm on Vox, and I'll give you the final couple of steps on Vox.
Okay, Ken. We got data and everything looks good. You're still go.
Okay. Thank you, sir.
In one minute, the EMS is going to Normal. Translation Control Power is on. Translation Controller and Rotation Controllers are Armed.
Got it.
The Arm light is out; the SPS Delta-V Thrust A is coming on -
Mark.
Average g is on. IPS [?] look good.
Ullage. Good ullage. Attitude's good. Engine enable.
There's ignition.
Auto shutdown.
Okay, residuals, I have - on Y is minus 0.1. I'll get you the Verb 6 Noun 20s, and you can watch that while I turn the Gimbal Motors, Off.
There's Number 2's Off; number 1's are Off. Normal powers are Off. Do you have the attitude, Houston?
That's affirmative.
Okay; I see that is no trim.
My Delta-VC was minus 9.1.
Roger; 9.1.
And I assume you're handling the DSE now so - Yeah, looks like you got it.
That's affirmative, Ken.
Okay; the Bus Ties came Off normally. I noticed when I set it up that - just before putting them on that Bus B - Battery B was reading a little bit lower than the others. It was reading about 34.
That's Roger, Ken. And we're - just about ready to do a Bat B charge. I'll give you a call. And if you'll give us Accept, we're ready to up-link the REFSMMAT.
You have Accept. And you want these fuel readings? I'm not sure they're valid, but it's 31.8 oxidizer, 32.8 on fuel, and a balance is now showing a minus - a decrease of 275, but we made the burn in the fixed position with secondary valves and Normal position.
Roger; copy.
Casper, the computer's yours, and we did your Verb 66 for you. And we'd like for you to start a Bat B charge.
-Okay. Let me finish my SIM bay configuration, and I'll be right with it.
Okay; you'd like to have a Battery B charge.
You guys are awful quiet, Henry. You must be plotting.
Roger. We got some more Flight Plan changes for you. Let me just read you the first one, here, and let you get going. We want you to do a Verb 49 maneuver to a P52 attitude. And it's about a 15-minute maneuver; we want you there by 46. So why don't you go ahead and load it up, and I'll give you the angles there: 180, 075, 345.
Okay; 180, 075, and 345. And can I put the computer in Block?
The computer's yours.
Okay, Hank. What time you need me there?
Roger; at 46. Looks like you gonna make it. And you might keep an eye on the middle gimbal angle on this thing. We're gonna watch it, too.
... with more than a minute. Oh, it should be clear. It's got a good bit of roll to go with that yaw. But I will keep an eye on it. Okay; why don't you read on?
Okay, at 169:46, P52, Option 1. And we want to pulse torque to the Ascent orient.
Okay. And this time you want to do a pulse torque, P52, Option 1, at 46.
Roger. And following that, open the Alpha Particle/X-Ray cover, and then turn the X-Ray on.
Okay. Then Open the Alpha/X-Ray cover, and the X-Ray to on.
Roger. 169:51, Verb 49 maneuver to Moulton point attitude, to be there at 170:20. And that's about a 9-minute maneuver. The Moulton point attitude is 225, 233, 358.
Okay, at time 51, I go to the Moulton point attitude: 225, 233, 358; and I have to be there by 170:20.
Roger. And High Gain to Auto at your convenience.
You've got it.
Okay; and following that maneuver, at that same time, go to the Experiment Checklist, Gegensehein pass Number 2, Page X/2-3, Steps 1 to 4.
Okay; that's - Experiment Checklist, page X/2-3, Gegenschein pass 2. Now you gave me some step numbers; does that mean I don't do the whole pass?
Well, we want the photos to start at 17:28.
Okay; stand by a minute. Let me get to that.
What that's doing, Ken, is that's one of these things where you manoeuvre around to the Moulton point, to the anti-solar point, and to the - do those sequences. So Steps 1 through 4 get you through the Moulton point sequence, then you got to do a little manoeuvre to the anti-solar point.
Okay. Okay, but like I'm gonna do the whole sequence. When you read steps, I thought maybe there was something I was supposed to leave out. Okay. So all we need is another set of attitudes and some times. Now let me have this Moulton point time? It has to be done no earlier than some given time.
Roger. We want you to start at 170:28. 170:28.
I will certainly try. But that's also the earliest. Is that correct?
That's affirmative. Following that sequence, at approx - well, that time is all wrong there. But we want you to do a Verb 49 maneuver to the anti-solar point. That's about a 5-minute manoeuvre. And the attitude is 279, 223, 356.
Oh, boy, - Hank, if we stick a 5-minute - a maneuver as long as that in there, I'm not sure we're gonna make it. Do you know why we're changing the roll that much? Last time we didn't change roll at all. We just made a little pitch maneuver down there.
Okay. FAO'll check that. But that is the same place there on the page on the checklist, the next step.
Okay.
They say here, if that is correct, that they want you at that attitude by 170:36, but as far as I'm concerned, you just step through the sequence.
That's the only thing I can do, Hank.
Roger.
What was that target time again? 170:36?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
You won't be there by then if that - Oh, I see. FAO says what they're trying to do is combine deep-space measurements with the - with these photos.
Okay.
And you're not going to be at that attitude by 36. It'll be more like 38.
At the best; yes, sir. Now we can put in a higher rate; that's up to you folks. Is it worth the gas?
You got the gas if you want to do it.
Well, I'd like to get as much data as I can, Hank. I don't know how to assess what's - worth keeping a little RCS for rendezvous. As opposed to -
Okay; press ahead and use the gas. Go to a higher rate and let's get these things.
Okay. I'll - I'll set the - right after I get to the Moulton attitude, I'll change the DAP to the high rate.
Okay, is there any question on that Gegenschein thing there, Ken?
I'm just looking it over. Just a second. Okay; I'm going - I'm on my way to the P52 attitude, which we're gonna get, I guess, here in daylight. That should be no problem. That's why we're gonna do a pulse torque, and I'll open the alpha/X-Ray covers and get the X-Ray on. And at time 51, I'm gonna try to do a Verb 49 to the Moulton attitude, which is 225, 233, and 358, to be there at 170:20. I'll then do those - pictures, and try to start them at 170:28. If I get in attitude, I'm gonna change the DAP to 10102. Then do a maneuver to the anti-solar point at 279, 223, and 356. And those pictures should begin at 170:36. At the conclusion of that sequence, I'll turn the DAP to 10101.
Okay. That sounds good, Ken. And at 171 hours, we want to turn the X-Ray to Standby and Close the Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover.
Okay, at 171, you want X-Ray to Standby and Close the Alpha/X-Ray Cover.
Roger; that's for Sun avoidance.
Roger; thank you.
Okay; is there something that comes after that? Do I go to another attitude, or what?
Stand by a minute, Ken.
Okay.
Okay, Ken. Following this, we want you to - this attitude'll be good, all the way up to 172:30. And we want you to get an eat period in there. And at 172:15, do a P52.
Okay. Just a second. You caught me without my book.
Okay, Hank. Say again those events.
Okay. The attitude that you're in at the completion of the Gegenschein will be good for that time until we pick up on the - in the Flight Plan at 172:30 where we marked it up. And the only thing we want you doing in this period is to eat. And at 172:15, do a P52.
Okay. I'll eat, do a P52 at 172:15, and be in the Flight Plan at 172:30.
That is affirmative. And for your information, the next AOS is at 171:14.
Okay. Thank you, sir.
Okay, Hank, I got 23 frames used on magazine ZZ. I assume that's enough to get me through this new sequence. Right?
That's affirmative. That should be a seven-frame sequence.
Okay.
And, Ken, for planning purposes, we're gonna delete your suit donning for the rendezvous, so you won't have to be worried about that.
Okay. All right. That'll unclutter the time a great deal. Thank you.
Can I go ahead and open the Alpha cover?
Stand by.
Roger; go ahead, Ken.
Okay. That baby's open.
That ought to get your attention, shouldn't it?
Roger.
Okay, the X-Ray is On.
Copy.
Well, we finally got a little serendipity, Hank.
How's that?
I was almost in the right attitude to start with. Hey, now, would you guys, in a little bit, not look? It sure is nice to get somewhere more than a minute before you have to be there. And we're all set up. I got the window shade up and the camera installed, and we're all ready to go.
Casper, Houston. We'd like you to configure for a SIM bay jett.
Okay.
Got it.
And, Casper, could you Reacquire on the High Gain? We're having a little trouble. Pitch, minus 30; Yaw, 80.
How's that?
Hey, that looks good.
Hank, just out of curiosity, all this - minor material that's sticking up through the mare down here has that same little bench on it that I described at Riphaeus Mountains. That includes some of these circular craters that are sticking up.
Roger; that sounds pretty interesting.
It has both a different color, and I think it has a different slope. But it looks just like a high-water mark on them, because everything around here is uniform.
Roger. Are you talking about the swirls?
Twirls? No, sir. I'm talking about these little benches that are on the side of every piece of material that sticks up through the mare surface.
Roger.
Casper, Houston. After you get the Alpha particle/X-Ray cover door closed at 171 hours, you can go back to coupled RCS.
Okay, let's see. After I close the door at 171, then you want me to go back to couples.
We want you that way at LOS so FDO'll get some good tracking on you.
Okay.
Hank?
You call, Ken?
Yes, sir. I'd like to verify what I'm supposed to be pointing at. It doesn't look like - you've got the camera in the 30-degree position according to the checklist. And it was my understanding that mark on my checklist on that star chart was the Moulton point, and it doesn't appear to me that my camera is pointing at that spot.
Stand by.
Okay. The checklist calls for the camera in the X position.
Looks to me like my camera is pointing about Gienah.
Oh, there it is. Okay. Now I'm glad we checked that.
Hank, it still looks to me like I'm pointing closer to Spica than I am to Antares.
Ken, FAO's verified that attitude, and they say it's good.
Okay. That's fine then.
Casper, Houston. We're a little over 2 minutes from LOS, and everything's looking good. INCO's got your recorder.
Okay. Thank you very much.
That's on Standby. No, it's actually Forward.
[Garble].
One, 2, 3, 4, 5. This is a test of the recorder. Over.
This tape will be used for the solar -
One, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. This is a test of the recorder - recording capability. One, 2, 3, 4, 5- Over.
Three, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. This is a test of the recorder - recording capability.
That's a way; it works.
Hello, Houston.
Hello, Casper. How's it going?
Oh, we're still here. Done all our chores. Got your SIM bay buttoned up. We're in couples; and, in lieu of anything else, I just switched to Wide Deadband just - because it didn't seem like there was any reason not to.
Okay.
I understand from your comment last time, Hank, that there are no other activities tentatively scheduled until the rendezvous sequence starts, so I can go ahead and start stowing things and getting set up for that in the next [garble].
Roger, Ken. The only thing scheduled is that P52 about an hour from now.
Okay. And I got you a P52 on the last pass if that'll help. And I used starts 27 and 31, and the torquing angles were plus 0.108, plus 0.061, plus 0.001, and I torqued that at time 170:59:30.
Roger, copy. Okay, you can delete the P52 an hour from now, then.
Okay, thank you.
And the plan is still to do the nominal rendezvous sequence up through bringing some of the basic equipment over, and then power down, and we'll jettison the LM tomorrow. Is that correct?
That's affirmative, Ken. That's still the plan.
Okay.
Casper, Houston. We're riding right at the edge of the High Gain scan limit; we would like for you to roll left 15 degrees.
Okay. Roll left 15.
Okay, Henry. Is that angle gonna be all right now?
Roger, Ken. That's good.
Casper, Houston.
Yes, sir.
I got some updates for you in the Flight Plan, back in Table [sic - means Page] 2-15, the transfer-after-docking table; Table Number 2-8, Page 2-15.
Okay, could you just - could you stand by for just a minute?
Will do.
Okay. Where's this now, Hank?
Roger. In the table, under item Number 8.
(Chuckle) Well. Tell me the page again.
Oh, it's Page 2-15; it's transfer-after-docking table - Table 2-8.
Okay.
Okay; under Item 8, where - We want to delete the LCG plugs; the PGA electrical connector covers, and the neck-ring dust covers. Those three items will be on the suits. And delete the DSEA. They'll take care of that tomorrow.
Okay. I take it from that they're coming up unsuited.
They're gonna take their suits off in the LM, Ken.
Oh, I see what you mean. Okay.
And the - the rest of these deletions are because they'll be taken care of tomorrow, also. Delete Item Number 12. And on the next page...
Okay.
...Item Number 15, delete the second and third lines. And delete Items 26, 27, and 28.
Okay. Let's see if I got all that, now. I got - under Item 8, delete the LCG plugs, the PGA pocket, contents, the neck-ring dust covers, and the DSEA. I deleted Item 12. I deleted the second and third lines of Item 15. I deleted Number 26, 27, and 28.
That's affirmative.
Okay.
And, Casper, I have two P24 PADs for you, whenever you're ready. The first one is at 173:20, in the Flight...
Okay.
...Plan.
This is after the numbers have been changed, right?
That's affirmative.
Okay, how far - let me see here how far ahead I need to change the numbers. I better do that right now, so we don't get - at first.
Okay. That's at the old 169:20.
Well, we're gonna - Let's all talk in the - in the real GETs and I'll change my numbers in the book right now.
Okay. 173:20.
Okay. I'll copy those numbers down.
Okay. And all of these are at 173 hours plus, Ken; so T1 is 173 plus 15:02, 19:52, 21:32, 22:20; south 10 nautical miles.
Okay. And I guess we got another one over here at 173:50.
That's affirmative. They're all 173 for the first number. T1 is 39:18, 44:08, 45:48, 46:36; north 1 nautical mile.
Okay. For Descartes, 173:39:18, 44:08, 45:48, 46:36, north 1. F-1, 173:15:02, 19:52, 21:32, 22 - that's 22:20 for T3, and south 10.
Good readback, Ken.
Casper, Houston. For your planning, I don't know whether it's been passed up or not, but no TV for rendezvous or docking.
Oh, okay. No, I hadn't gotten that.
The reason for that, Ken, is that the - the television interferes with the LM comm. They've been having a comm problem there with their steerable.
Okay. Well, that's one less big item to not have to unstow.
Casper, Houston. While you're working there, I'll just read you part of a little note I got from Farouk in the backroom. He says that "We feel that your descriptions of the visual targets have been very accurate and extremely significant." Also, concerning your comments on the site, the traverse planning troops were very happy to have them, and many of your comments were taken into consideration in planning EVAs 2 and 3.
Thank you. That's awfully kind.
Hey, Hank.
Go ahead.
How about giving me a call about 5 minutes before we pass over the landing site and about 5 minutes before we hit the Riphaeus Mountains.
Will do.
Ken, I think you just passed the landing site.
Oh. Okay. Well, better luck next time. How about the Riphaeus Mountains, then?
Okay. I'll give you a call 5 minutes prior.
Casper, Houston. You're approximately 5 minutes from the mountains.
Okay. Thank you very much.
Sorry about that.
What's that you're sorry about, Ken?
Oh, the camera got the Velcro on the lip mike and caught it in the Velcro on the back of the camera. I thought it was probably making a lot of noise at you.
We could hear the camera cycling.
Hank, before I throw out the electrophoresis, I'd like to verify that's still the intention.
Okay. I'll have them check on it.
That's still in the plan, Ken.
Okay.
Casper, Houston. I know you're gonna love these words, but I got one more Flight Plan change.
(Laughter) Okay. Hang on a second and I'll be with you. Let me get things tied down. Well, it looks like that last - last month of training was well worthwhile.
Okay, Hank. Read away.
Okay. First one is at 173:50.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Okay. At - Does it say something there about a Verb 49 maneuver to a P52 COAS cal? That's after that. 173:55. Want to change that attitude to 180, 255, 357?
Okay, that COAS cal attitude will be 180, 255, 357.
Roger. And the high gain angles are minus 75, 249.
Okay. Minus 75 and 249.
Okay. Next page, 174:09; delete the configure for urine jump - dump, and the H2 Purge Line Heaters, On.
Okay.
Same page, at the bottom, 174:28. Delete the fuel cell purge and the dumps.
Okay, that's done.
Next page at 174:36, starting with CM4 TV bracket. Delete all through don PGA.
Okay. I ought to be well ahead by then. If you'd like for me to wear the suit, why, it's no problem. I'm not requesting to wear it, but if you'd like for me to, why, it's no sweat.
Not required, Ken. That takes some time out after the docking, Ken. That helps that time line.
Okay. Anything there is a big help.
Okay. At 175:13.
Okay. I got those deletions. Go ahead.
At AOS, we want to change the angles there to minus 75, 249; and put these Reacq and Wide. And this Reacq and Wide's gonna help the LM comm.
Okay.
At 177:19 -
Say again the time?
177:19.
Okay.
Delete TV, on. And anywhere else in there you run across that TV, just delete it.
All righty.
And the last change is at 178 hours, at the top of the page.
Okay.
P20, Option 5, minus-X forward SIM bay attitude. I'll get you your deadband on that in a second. Following that, "Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover, Open. Alpha Particle, On"...
Hey, you give me minus-X - Start that whole P20 thing again, Hank.
Okay. It's P20, option 5, minus-X forward. That's the SIM bay attitude.
Okay. And do you say you do not have a deadband yet?
Three degrees.
Say again?
Noun 79 will be a 3-degree deadband.
Okay.
Okay. "Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover, Open. Alpha Particle experiment, Alpha On. X-Ray, On. Gamma Ray, Deploy. Mass Spec, Deploy." And after the Mass Spec is Deployed, "Mass Spec Experiment, On. Ion Source, Standby."
Okay. Got all that. P20, Option 5, minus-X; 3-degree deadband, the Alpha Door comes Open, the Alpha comes On; the X-Ray comes On; the Gamma goes out; the Mass Spec goes to Deploy; the Mass Spec Experiment comes On when it is Deployed, and Ion Source to Standby.
That's a good readback, Ken. That should take you on up past rendezvous and docking.
(Laughter) You care to have a little friendly wager?
Negative, because I just got another change, if you'll flip back a page to the 177:55?
(Laughter) Okay, go ahead.
Want to delete the Verb 49 maneuver to LM jets since we're not doing that tonight.
Okay.
And that's about revision U - Uniform, I'll have Victor for you here shortly, probably.
Okay, no sweat. Whenever you get it, give me a call. Meanwhile, I'll be picking up toys here.
Casper, you're looking good going around the hill, and INCO has your recorder.
Okay. Thank you very much. I'll see you in a few minutes.
Hello, Houston. Do you read?
Casper, Houston. Reading you weak and noisy.
Hello, Houston. Do you read?
Casper, Houston. I'm reading you very weak with lots of noise. Over.
Casper, Omni Delta.
Houston, do you read Casper?
Casper, Houston. Reading you very weak. If you read, go Omni Delta.
Houston, can you read Casper? Over.
Casper, Houston. How do you read?
Casper, DAC on.
Houston, how do you read Casper?
Casper, Houston. Reading you very weak. Coming up on 10 seconds to T-2.
Casper, Omni Delta.
Okay. How about that one?
Hey, a lot better now, Ken. We had a bad antenna, I guess, on this acquisition. The mark should have gone on the tape recorder, though.
Okay, I - The tape recorder wasn't running. So I started it on Low Bit Rate for you.
Thank you.
Ken, for your information, the LM is not going to do a P22.
Okay: thank you.
Casper, Houston. It looks like we got a - about 10 minutes here or so that's free. I got Flight Plan change Victor here.
(Laughter) Okay. Let me make one quick note on what I marked on there and - on F-1 and I'll - be with you.
Okay.
That's an awfully big target to be marking on. So I picked a little target on the side of it.
Okay. I'm ready for change Victor.
Okay. And for your information, Ken, the stowage for the items transferred from the LM to the CSM will be nominal. First change is at 179:20. And guess we should have brought that page up to add the 4 hours to.
179:20. I did that. That's 79:20. Go ahead.
Okay, just to make sure we're at the right place, that's the old 175:20.
Yes, sir.
Okay. At that place...
Big blank area right there.
Right. At that place put, "On LM request, connect LM/CM umbilical and transfer over to the CSM."
Okay. "On LM request connect the LM/CM umbilical and transfer power to the LM" at 179:20.
Roger. At 179:45, "Close LM hatch -
And?
"Hatch installation decal, LM Tunnel Vent valve to LM/CM Delta-P; tunnel lights, off."
Okay. You want to close the LM hatch, and I take it you want to install the Command Module hatch.
That's...
And we'll do a LM/CM Delta-P for the position, and the tunnel lights off.
Roger. And delete the update block, the weight block, and the Verb 40 load - Verb 48 load. And right under that, put "Mass Spec Ion Source, On."
Okay. All right, go ahead.
That's right under where I had the Verb 48. This is 280 hours but - just to get it in there. Mass Spec Ion Source, On. VHF AM B, Off, Center." And begin the eat period.
Okay. Now somewhere I need to load the - the LM weight into CS - add it to the CSM weight. Or at least I have the LM weight on there for the DAP. Let's see - Is that already taken care of? You're gonna give me a LM weight sometime earlier. So it will be covered. Okay.
Okay, that ought to occur right after docking, Ken.
Yeah, I got it. Okay.
Okay. You can start turning pages now, I guess, and we want to - at the old 176, we want to scrub that whole page. Actually, we are gonna scrub everything from 176 on up through 181 up - well, up to 181. So page 176, 176:30, scrub those two columns. On the next page, the 177, the...
You're not gonna want to use them again tomorrow?
Negative. They say not. Don't scrub them too heavily.
Okay. I don't want to copy all that over again tomorrow (laughter).
At this point, let's just skip over them...
Yeah, we won't do anything [garble].
Okay. Anyhow, go on over to 181 hours. And this is the real...
Okay, 181...
...181. What it says right there in your Flight Plan. And put LiOH canister change...
Okay, and that's the same for both, huh?
That's affirmative.
LiOH change?
Roger; 15 into Bravo. Stow 12 in Alfa 3.
Okay.
And if you want to write "Hallelujah" or something in there, we're back on the nominal plan again.
(Laughter)
Still in the morning. You notice...
(Laughter) I think that's called a champion event.
Roger. We just got in there for the rest period.
(Laughter) Well, I'm glad you didn't decide to scrub that one.
And that's it for right now, Ken.
(Laughter) Okay. I'll go back and see if I can pick up the - Orion and the landing site.
Okay.
Okay, Hank. One of the things we didn't talk about was I got 509 running now, and I'm gonna turn it off when I finish this next P24. Does that sound alright?
Stand by.
That's a good plan, Ken.
Ten seconds to T-2 - T-1.
Okay. Thank you.
Casper, are you gonna do the comm check with the LM?
Okay. It has another minute or so.
Orion, Casper on Victor Hotel. How do you read? Over.
Orion, this is Casper. Over.
Casper's trying to call you now. And the configuration is on 7-12, on your checklist.
Ken, they should be configured here in just a second.
Hello, Orion. You got the combination. Good afternoon.
Okay, Casper. This is Orion. How do you read? Over.
Loud and clear, John.
Orion, this is Casper. Reading you loud and clear.
Okay, I'm not reading him.
Loud and clear, John. How me?
Casper. DAC on.
Okay, Casper. How do you read? Over.
Loud and clear, John. How me?
Roger. We read you 5 by, Ken. With a little squeal.
Okay. You're loud and clear, Charlie.
How's things up there?
Oh, just fine. Smile, I'm gonna take your picture here in a minute.
Good show.
Casper, the DAC should be running.
DAC is running.
And you're coming up on 10 seconds to T-2.
Okay.
Man, that's hard to see in this sunlight.
Okay. On target.
In this Sun angle, that Flag and Spook are hard to see until you are right on top of them.
Okay, on target. By this Sun angle, that Flag and Spook are hard to see until you're right on top of them.
Casper, Houston. We've got a bunch of PADs to get up to you. The first one I've got for you is your - a range update, whenever you're ready to copy.
A range update.
Roger. The - the - ranges that you have are a little bit in error. I'd like to give you the correct ones, so that when you compare your ranging, it'll look more better to you.
You mean the nominal ranges in the rendezvous profile?
That's affirmative, sir.
Oh, okay. All righty.
Okay. Range at insertion should be 171 nautical miles.
Okay, that'll be 171. Ready.
insertion plus 6 is 142.
Okay.
Omni Alfa, Casper.
You've got it.
Okay. Insertion plus 9 is 129.
And insertion plus 12 is 120.
Okay, let's see, that's - those aren't the same figures I've got in here, are they?
They should be about 15 miles different as I understand.
Hey, what was the last one you gave me? Insertion plus how much?
Plus 12. And it was 120.
Okay.
Mattingly: Okay.
And I have that big bug-a-boo, the P27 update.
Okay, I'm ready to copy.
Okay. CSM L - Correction, 71; GET, 175:43:30; index, 21; starting with 02, 01501, 00002, 00337, 02513, 00006, 35240, 77727, 75532, 77055, 73120, 61613, 77570, 70222, 51111, 07425. Break, Omni Bravo.
You got it.
Roger. And starting with 21, 04510. And that's the end of that column. Starting on the next one, LM 71...
Hang on a minute, Hank. Stand by.
Okay, Henry, go ahead.
Okay, starting with LM, vector 71; GET, 175:55:00; index 21; data, 01501, 77775, 00270, 04377, 77662, 70436, 77660, 74724, 67755, 61614, 62362, 55364, 72047, 52342, 07431, 13320. End of PAD.
Okay. Suppose I read it back to you as Verb 71, CSM 175:43:30; 21; 01501, four balls 2, 00337, 02513, four balls 6, 35240, 77727, 75532, 77055, 73120, 61613, 77570, 70222, 51111, 07425, 04510. LM Verb 71; 175:55:00; 21; 01501, 77775, 00270, 04377, 77662, 70436, 77660, 74724, 5 - Correction, 67755, that's line 12. Starting on line 13, 61614, 62362, 55364, 72047, 52342, 07431, 13320. Over.
Good readback, Ken.
Amazing.
And if you'll give us Accept and bring up the high gain, we'll get your state vector up.
Casper, I have a correction to that range update I gave you.
Okay. Stand by just a second.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. The Insertion plus 12 should read 116.
Okay. Plus 12 is 116.
Okay, I owe you a consumables status. Everything's great there. We're nominal. And on the RCS, we're 153 pounds over the redline.
Okay.
And the CSM weight that's stored in the CSM - CMC is okay.
All right.
You want to give me a hack at the LM weight, or I'll just guess at 5900 again.
Stand by, Ken.
LM weight is 5953
Okay, thank you.
Casper, you can terminate the BAT B charge now.
Okay. Battery B charge is off.
Casper, the computer's yours
Okay, thank you.
Casper, I have an ascent PAD for you.
Okay, stand by.
Okay. You got the numbers?
We got the angles, Ken. Torque them.
You copy, Casper? You're clear to torque?
Roger. Torqued.
Hey, Hank. Do we have enough time to let me take a look at this COAS star, or do you want to get your PAD first?
Okay, we've got about 10 minutes to LOS.
Okay, Ed. We're in good shape then, because the star is right here.
Okay. Why don't you press ahead with the COAS?
Okay. All righty. I'll be done with it in just a jiffy.
That's pretty close, isn't it?
Roger.
Okay, I'm ready to copy your PAD.
Okay. Direct ascent first.
Okay.
TIG is at 175:43:35.18; Noun 37 176:37:52.00. Co elliptic: lift-off, 175:46:09.37; Noun 11, 176:44:33.91; Noun 37, 178:37 all zips.
Okay, direct lift-off: 175:43:35.18; TPI, 176:37:52.00. Co elliptic PAD: lift-off, 173:46:09.37; CSI, 176:44:33.91; TPI, 178:37:00.00.
Good readback, Ken.
Hey, Casper. You better stand by for a load. John and Charlie are bringing 271 pounds of rocks.
(Laughter) Outstanding.
Casper, Houston. About 3 minutes from LOS. Everything looks good here.
Okay. See you next time around.
Roger.
