Orion, Houston.
Hello, Houston.
Roger. Where are you in the checklist now?
Houston, 16.
Hello, 16; this is Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Hank. We're closed out. The tunnel vent - the tunnel is being vented now. One question on that LM - that was a pretty big bird. You got enough RCS - I did not crossfeed. You got enough RCS?
Stand by.
Apollo 16, Houston. Would you verify that you left Orion in Auto and not Attitude Hold?
Okay. I went to Att Hold. Over.
Roger. Copy, Att Hold.
Hank, we had everything scratched out there. I had so many erasures on this page that it just got by - left in Att Hold.
Roger. Understand.
Houston, can we go ahead with the logics check?
Roger. Proceed with the logics check, and we're trying to get a Go/No Go on the jett right now.
Okay. We're going be tight. We're still doing the integrity check,
Okay; the logics are both on.
Go for Pyro Arm.
Say again, Hank.
Roger. You're Go for Pyro Arm.
Okay. Okay.
Apollo 16, Houston. We're Go for LM jett.
Apollo 16, you have a Go for LM jett.
Roger. We have a Go for LM jett. We'll try to make it.
16, make sure your suit integrity checks are okay before you do it.
Okay, Houston; we're going to be about 45 or a minute late. Is that okay?
That's okay.
LM jett complete.
Roger. Copy. Jett complete.
Houston, the LM doesn't seem to be holding attitude.
Roger. Understand doesn't seem to be holding attitude?
That's affirmative. Okay. And, Hank, would you run over my RCS select procedures again? I'm not sure I got the right combination for you.
Okay, Ken. We don't have High Bit Rate. The way you can do this is ...
What should they be, please?
Okay. We just want the single jet authority in roll. That's the only thing we have to worry about the boom. And you're gonna have to burn out the - your Y as if you were trimming the plane-change burn, using that same roll and - roll 90 degrees to get rid of your Y.
If I go into attitude, I can get it all in - get rid of the Y anyhow, can't I?
Say again, Ken?
If I get over to zero yaw, I can get rid of this Y. Isn't that correct.
Stand by.
Okay, Ken. And, of course with - you can't trim plus-Z. That's just like as if you were trimming on TEI. You're going to have to roll 90, and trim out your - your plus-Z.
Okay.
Roger. You've got the stick.
Roger.
Casper, give as Omni Charlie.
You've got Omni Charlie.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 16, Houston. Give us your best Omni.
You're in Bravo.
Roger. That sounds pretty good, Charlie.
The residuals of Noun 85 at the time we quit burning were plus 0.2, plus 0.2, and minus 0.1. I'll give you the angles. Noun 20: 270.08, plus 011.74, plus 001.94.
Roger. Copy, Ken. And we have a boom jettison attitude for you.
Okay. Could you say what your boom jettison attitude is, Hank?
Roger. 140, 357, 000; and the jett time is - We've selected as 195:35, but the time is good from 00:25 to 00:45.
Roger.
And, 16; Houston. The high-gain angles for that attitude are plus 6, 345 yaw.
Hey, Houston; 16. Do they have control of the LM?
Doesn't appear that we have, Charlie. That pitch angle was 357.
Okay, 357. 140, 357, 000 for boom jett.
That's affirmative. And we need Manual and Wide on the High Gain for that - those angles I gave you.
Okay. Say again the high-gain numbers, again.
Roger. Plus 6 for pitch, yaw 345, Manual and Wide.
Okay, Houston. Tell me what you think went wrong on that LM jett.
Stand by. We're still trying to psych it out.
Houston, Orion didn't look like she fired any jets when we separated at all.
Roger. Copy. No jet firing. And we didn't see any on the telemetry that we had down here, either.
That Orion was a mighty good spacecraft. Real beautiful flying machine and a real great lunar base, too. We'll miss her.
When you had data there, Hank, on Orion, how did the RCS system look?
They looked good, Charlie.
Apollo 16, Houston. If possible, we would like to have somebody watch when you jettison the boom; see if they can see it going.
Okay.
Hank, would you give me the jettison time again, please?
Roger. We have given you a time of 195:35 [195:23], Ken, but anywhere between 00:25 and 00:45 is good.
Okay. That goes for 00:25 to 00:45.
This attitude should put the CSM out in front of everything, the boom and the LM.
Apollo 16, Houston; could you bring up the High Gain?
Okay.
And, Apollo 16; for your information, that boom jett velocity is somewhere in the neighborhood of 7 feet per second.
Okay.
Reacq and Narrow on the High Gain, please.
Okay.
You should not, but if you get one, it'll come on right away.
Okay.
And I'll get up here and see if I can look out this side hatch, too.
Okay.
Okay. We're about to jettison the boom.
Okay.
Roger.
Okay; go.
Okay. It's up ...
Okay.
... and off. There she goes.
Boom clear.
Straight out. Boom's clear.
I'll see if I can see it.
Not a bit of roll. There she goes, Ken, this way...
[Garble] see it.
...straight out Window 5.
Hey, that is beautiful.
Understand the boom blew clear. Is that correct?
That's affirmative.
That's about as stable as you can get. That thing isn't tumbling, rolling, doing a thing.
Let me see it. Can I see it?
Yeah. It's right straight out there. Beautiful. Here, Charlie. Charlie?
Hey, it's great to know one thing works.
Yeah.
There she goes.
Gee, I hadn't even thought of that [garble].
It's all set.
Apollo 16, if you can get to it, we'd like to terminate the Bat A Charge.
That's terminated, Hank.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 16, Houston. We've got a Flight up - Flight Plan update we would like to get up to you, if we could get one of you to doff a suit right quick. It would be easier to copy.
I'll just copy right now, Hank. Doffing suits is nothing easy for anybody.
Hank, can we go ahead and go to the satellite launch attitude?
That's affirmative.
Okay, and is there any reason not to have couples on now?
That's negative. You can go couple now, Ken.
Okay. I have.
Okay, Ken, and the first changes we want to get to, start at Page 3 - 328.
Go ahead.
Roger. Now, 218 hours there is now 196:10 [195:59]. And you have a constant delta...
Yes, sir.
...constant delta from now on of subtracting 21 hours and 50 minutes, and this will apply through TEI.
Okay, that's a minus 21:50 through TEI, and I think I have marked all my pages with that amount already.
All righty. Then the first change is at 196:21. Delete the "Verb 48" and the "P20" and the "Set Omni." Just delete that group of data.
Okay.
At 196:35, add "Enable all jets, except A-1, A-2, B-1, Bravo 2, Delta 1, Delta 2."
Hank, is that the SIM jet - jet configuration?
Negative. This gives you couple jets in all axes but roll, and we want Quad 3 providing roll control. Now this is so FDO can get good tracking for TEI, and this is being coordinated with OSC and is acceptable to the Mapping Camera PADs.
Okay, why don't you - you read me a list of jets not to have on. Is that right?
That's affirmative. Everything on, except Alfa 1 and Alfa 2 ...
Okay, now - Keep going.
... Bravo 1, Bravo 2, and Delta 1 and Delta 2.
This just gives you B/D Roll, Off.
Yea, that Logic probably should go back to - No, - center. Bottom position's okay, too. That's it.
Do you have that, Ken?
Okay, at 35 - that's 196:35, you've got enable everything except these, and the exceptions are A-1, 2, B-1, B-2, D-1, and D-2.
That's correct. And following that, P20 Option 5 plus-X forward SIM attitude - to be there at 196:41. Noun 79, 0.5-degree dead band. High Gain, Pitch 10, Yaw 0 for AOS acq.
Okay, Hank, does that mean that the - that the jettison attitude is going to be very close to the P20 attitude?
Should be about a six-minute maneuver.
Well, was there any reason for not doing all that stuff earlier?
What are you referring to, Ken?
Well, you just gave me a maneuver here to be done after I enable the engines at 00:35 and - and to be there by 00:41. And, we keep running into these things where you roll out and start the camera; and, if that's the case, I'd like to start the maneuver a little earlier. I'd like to have some padding there.
Okays I guess I don't see any magic about - about the time when you do that. If you want to back it up, that's fine.
Okay. We'll do so. Thank you very much. But we'll be there in any event by 00:41.
Roger. And at 00:42, and I don't see why you can't do this one early either, Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover, Open; Mapping Camera, Extend.
Okay. We'll get the Mapping Camera covers open and the Camera extended.
At 196:47 [196:35], Laser Altimeter, On; Image Motion, On; Mapping Camera, On; T-start; Image Motion, Increase, barber pole plus 1. And your T-start is 196:49:43.
Okay. T-start is 196:49:43.
And we'll have the Laser, On, and the IMC, On, and we'll go to barber pole plus 1.
That's affirmative. And at 196:52, orbital science visual, King. That's Victor 4. It's on charts Delta 4 and Delta 5, window 5. And note that the visual runs until 197:02.
Okay. We'll cover King on window 5 when we go by it.
Roger. And at 196:56 [196:44]: acquire mix - MSFN, Manual, Wide, Pitch 10, Yaw 0.
Okay. We'll acquire MSFN at Pitch 10 and Yaw zero, in Manual and Wide.
Okay, Ken, and we'll save the rest of this until the next rev. You can go ahead and start dopping [sic - "doffing"?] and getting ready for the satellite jett.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay, Houston. Going off comm for doffing the suits.
Roger. Copy.
Hank, before tomorrow, we'd like - well, right away, would - would you guys ask the suit people what we could do to get some lubrication into these wrist rings? John and mine are real tight, and we're get - finding them very difficult to lock. Over.
Okay, Charlie. I'll do that.
Houston, 16.
Go ahead.
Hank, I'm looking ahead here trying to find out where we have a Pan Camera turn-on, and I don't see it. Maybe I'm missing it somewhere. Can you - I thought you said something about we're supposed to have both a Mapping Camera and a Pan Camera pass.
Roger, Ken. We get it on it just after AOS at 197:03 [196:52]. We got some more changes for you for that Rev, and we thought we'd read them up the first part of the rev, rather than clutter you up right now.
Why don't you clutter me up right now with those things, please.
You want them now? Okay, 197:03...
Yes, please. Go ahead.
Okay, 197:03 [196:52]; Image Motion, Increase; barber pole, On; Pan Camera, Standby, Stereo, Power; 197:05, configure camera for orbital science; CM5/EL...
Whose?
...250/CEX intervalometer. That's f/8, 1/250...
Huh?
...infinity. You'll be taking 128 frames...
I think this is where it's - where it's bad.
... magazine Romeo Romeo. 197:14, PC ...
[Garble] got it [garble].
Okay, what's that going to be a target of, Hank?
Okay, we're going to pick up that long run you had that; started down at Vogel and...
Why don't you get a new one of those?
... and went up to Lassell and Alpetragius end stopped. And then you picked up at the one down at Bullialdus. Well, Bullialdus ...
Why don't you get a new one of those?
... PC - Okay, we're going to pick up that long run you had that started down at Vogel and ...
Why don't you get a new one of those?
... and went up to Lassell and Alpetragius end stopped. And then you picked up at the one down at Bullialdus. Well, Bullialdus ...
Hey, John.
... is too far south. So what we're going to do is start at Vogel, make a Jog at Alpetragius, and go all the way to the Helmet on past Gassendi. And we're about up on LOS now; I'll tell you more about that at AOS.
Okay, Hank. Thank you.
Okay. What were you getting ready to ask?
Huh?
What were you getting ready to ask?
[Garble].
Okay. I got to - got to launch this satellite now.
What time does that come on?
In three minutes. John, can you get over there? I got to launch this satellite in three minutes.
Sure.
Okay; I'm Panel 230. Check that the Data System is On.
Here, I'll get it, John.
[Garble].
Okay. On Panel 230, you got a couple more things. Make sure the - Is the Gamma Ray retracted? Is the switch down in Retract position and is the talkback gray?
Yeah.
[Garble].
Okay; before I can tell if that talkback's gray, are those switches on 181 in the center Off or in the Deploy/Retract position? Put them down to Deploy/Retract.
[Garble].
Huh?
Gamma Ray's still gray.
Okay. Alpha/X-Ray Covers, Close, Charlie.
Oh, sure.
Alpha/X-Ray ...
Hey, wait a minute. They're here. They are closed.
We're in attitude; we've been damping rates. Holy smokes! Where was I going to put that attitude? Okay.
Okay, on 250, we've already checked our Pyro A, Sequential A; Pyro B, Sequential B is Closed. Okay; on 181. Logic Power, two, is closed. We know that. The Logic Power switches, two of them, up to Jettison.
Okay. All right, the next thing we'll do is I'll give you a call when to hit the Satellite Launch switch. And we - we're about a minute and a half from the launch. And the Satellite Launch switch is one - is one that you put up and hold. I think it's a three-position guy.
That [garble] switch?
Yeah. But not now. I'll give you a call.
[Garble].
We'll see if it - if it - should be a - a - maintain. And it should go barber pole when you put it up, and it should hold barber pole until it's launched, and then it should go back to gray.
Say again?
[Garble].
Okay. And the circuit breakers are in? The two logic guys next to them? All right.
[Garble] seconds.
Two, 3, 4, 5...
Launch.
[Garble].
[Garble] out there.
Okay, did you turn? Retract?
[Garble] found this mistake.
Barber pole?
[Garble].
[Garble] go gray?
[Garble].
It went back to the center Off position?
They're Off.
Okay, Logic Power [garble] 181 [garble] Deploy/Retract. That's done.
[Garble].
Okay.
[Garble].
All right.
[Garble].
Good [garble] good work.
I found our - I found their mistake. Their mistake. They left the - they didn't have any AC power [Garble].
[Garble].
Yeah.
[Garble] asking me - asking me AC power.
[Garble].
Yeah. Okay [garble].
Okay, Charlie. It's - it's no good then.
Okay [garble].
Casper, Houston. How do you read?
Casper, Houston. How do you read?
Casper, how do you read Houston?
Hello there.
How you doing?
Okay, looks like we got a good lock now.
Okay. And, Ken, would you verify that you copied the Flight Plan changes at 197:03 and 197:05 that were given just prior to LOS.
Well, I don't know if I copied the ones that you think you gave. I copied some that said, "IMC to barber pole, and Pan Camera, Standby, Stereo, Power," and then something got started about orbital science photos, and that was all I got.
Okay, the first one there that you just read back was at 197:03; and at 197:05, we have "Configure Camera for orbital science, Command Module 5/EL/250/CEX intervalometer f/8, 1/250, infinity, 128 frames, magazine Romeo Romeo."
Don, you gonna give me some words on what that target is?
Stand by one. I'll get you that.
Okay, why don't you - can you give me some idea of how long it'll be? I'm - I - I don't know whether I have time to take my suit off or what.
Okay, Ken, that - that target position you're going to add are Vogel, and - and that goes all the way up through the cinder cone there. Actually, you're changing over at Alpetragius - a little jog, and then on up past the cinder cone. And you were originally scheduled to look at Bullialdus, and we're going to have to delete that because your track is too far to the north now. So, we're going to bring your groundtrack from the cinder cone right on up through Helmet and Gassendi and on up to Mersenius Rille, from D-11, 12, and 13.
Okay, you want to take one continuous strip.
That's affirmative.
Make one continuous strip from Vogel to Alpetragius to the cinder cone to the Helmet to Gassendi to the Mersenius Rille.
That's affirmative; except there will be that little jog at Alpetragius over to - to the right there and then on up through cinder cone and straight on up through Helmet, then Gassendi and on up to the rille.
Yeah, I understand that. I'm going to have to have some help on the f-stops, and I guess I'd rather have you call them out to me rather than have me try to write them down and jot them on a map and all that jazz.
Okay; we'll do that.
Okay; thank you. And can you give me a time for passage of Vogel?
Okay, hang on a minute.
Okay, it looks like 197:29 is for Vogel. And it'll be a continuous pass from that point on.
Okay; thank you.
Okay, and I have a couple of other updates at 197:14 and 15.
Go ahead.
Okay, at 197:14 [197:12], it's Pan Camera, Operate; T-start 197:14:18.
Okay, that's 197:14:18 [197:12:28] for the Pan Camera to be running. We'll get it.
Roger. And right now, you're up to that point where you should go Image Motion, Increase, and Pan Camera, Standby, and all that stuff at 197:03 [196:52].
Okay.
Okay; and at 197:15 [197:03], we want Image Motion, Increase.
Stand by, please.
Okay. Standing by.
Okay, Don. Go ahead.
Okay, at 197:15 [197:03], we want Image Motion, Increase, barber pole, plus 3 steps/On.
Okay. Barber pole plus 3 at 15.
That's affirmative.
Okay. Is that - is that all for about 10 minutes, please?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Houston, 16.
Go ahead, 16.
Okay. I think, looking back at the procedures during the back side pass, I think I've figured out what's wrong with the LM, but I'm not really sure.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. With the changes from yesterday that were not updated this morning, it looks like to me on Pages 16 and 17 of the Timeline Book, we came out of there with no AC power. Both Inverter breakers are Open.
Roger; understand. Due to the changes yesterday that were not updated today, on Pages 16 and 17 of the Timeline Book, you came out without AC power.
That's apparently what happened, and I think that the ATCA/PGNS needs AC to fire the jets - but I'm not really - to get the control voltage, but I'm not really positive.
They're saying here, Charlie, that AC is not required to fire the jets.
Okay. Then that didn't - hmm. Okay. Well, I don't know what happened, then.
Roger. Don't worry about it, Charlie. We're not.
Okay; fine. It's just - disappointing. Except for that one switch, I left everything just like you wanted it.
Roger.
Again, Casper, as a reminder, you should now be about through configuring the camera for orbital science, and we're about two and a half minutes away from the Pan Camera, Operate.
Casper, we've got a REFSMMAT for you any time you can let us have the computer.
Okay; you got - computer.
Right.
Okay, Houston. You have the computer.
Roger; copy.
And, Casper; would you go High Gain, Auto.
16, Houston. I've got some SPS cue card changes, and have a request on Secondary Propellant Pressure switches Open, if somebody can copy.
Could you wait on that SPS cue card stuff until I get through the photo strip, Don?
Roger.
Will it be too crowded for that?
Negative. I don't think so.
Say again, Don.
We'll hold off. Go ahead with your strip.
Okay. Looks like we're about a minute from Boboland [?].
Okay. I'm all set; thank you. And I'm starting with an f/8 and 1/250. And I'll wait for you to tell me when to change settings.
Roger. We'll do it.
Don, one of the things that I just noticed in passing Alphonsus is the dark halo craters. And each of those has a little amount of light material inside of the crater itself, just like all the rest of these craters around here. So maybe a dark halo is really an early stage in development.
Roger. We copy. And in a couple of minutes, Ken, we'll have you go to f/5.6. I'll call you on time.
Thank you.
Okay, Ken. In about 15 seconds, you should be north of Bullialdus, and we'll have you go to f/5.6 at that point.
Hey, right now, I'm just passing Lassell C, looking straight down.
Roger.
Okay, Ken. Go to 5.6 as you get up - a beam of Bullialdus.
Okay. Abeam Bullialdus; I'll go to 5.6.
Roger.
Okay, Ken. In about a minute or so, we'll be up by Helmet. And, at that time, we'll want to change the shutter to 1/125.
Okay.
Okay, Ken. Looks good on 1/125 on the shutter, and you should be coming up by Helmet pretty soon now.
Okay, Ken. We show Pan Camera T-stop now.
Okay. And it's in Standby. I've completed the photo strip. I have 160 frames on magazine RR. And magazine Victor, I finished it off with, and it now has 160 frames showing.
Roger. Understand 160 frames on RR and on Victor. We'll also go Mapping Camera, Off, now.
And on she Mapping Camera -
It's Off.
Okay. We'll wait a few more seconds here, 30 seconds total. And then we can go Mapping Camera, Standby.
Okay. And you can go Pan Camera, Off, now. And you can go Laser Altimeter, Off.
Okay. The Laser's Off. The Pan Power's Off. And I'm going to Standby on the mapper.
Roger.
And the Image Motion is Off.
Roger. Okay. And then we want to do Mapping Camera, Retract.
Mapping Camera's Retracting .
Okay.
Okay, Don. You want to talk about that - the cue card change, or whatever it was you were getting ready to do awhile back?
Roger. And verify that you've got Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover Closed.
No, sir, I haven't. Just now got the camera in.
Okay; then we want Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover Closed, and enable all jets.
Okay. We got the Cover Closed.
Okay. The jets are configured.
Okay. We need to go to Block on the computer. And, Ken, it looks like that circ flag has not been set. I'm sorry; it's set. It needs to be reset.
You :mean - you mean the numbers, Verb 45?
Stand by a minute. Verb 45, Ken.
Okay, Ken. And we've got one note on the Service Module RCS system. I got a TEI PAD, couple more changes to the Flight Plan, and a SPS cue card change for you. And you can copy them in any order you want.
Okay. Let's start with your RCS notes. And then following that, let's take the Flight Plan, and the - I think - Let's take the RCS, the cue card, the Flight Plan, and finally the PADs.
Okay. The RCS note is we want the Service Module RCS Secondary Propellant Pressure switches, four, Open. And that's to prevent the primary fuel tank depletion during TEI.
Don, did you copy?
Roger, Ken. I copied you. And I had started reading there on the RCS note. Did you read that?
No, sir. I hadn't [garble]...
No, we missed you.
Okay. I'll - I'll try it again here. The Service Module RCS Secondary Propellant Fuel Pressure switches, four, Open. And the purpose for that is to prevent primary tank fuel tank depletions during TEI.
Do that right now?
Stand by one. That's affirmative. That's affirmative. We want to go ahead and do it now.
Got four, Open.
Okay. Now the SPS cue card. Let me know when you're ready to copy.
Okay, Don. Go ahead. And why don't you give me an outline of what is first, so I have some idea of what to do, and then I'll work on the card. We can go back and do it in detail.
Okay. First of all, about a third of the way down the page, we've got a note on the - on PNGS operation for TEI, and then we've got a couple or three words to add down about nine lines from the bottom on the gimbal trim and verify manual thrust vector control. And we're gonna say there, "Except Yaw." And seven lines from the bottom, we're going to have you open the Pitch 2 and Yaw 2 Battery B circuit breakers to keep the Secondary system from getting an - or sensing an overcurrent and shutting itself down. And on the back of the card, we're going to reclose those two circuit breakers after the Delta-V Thrust Stop.
Okay. Is there some reason you think that we need that added protection this time?
I guess it's just a feeling that if you get into TEI and you lose the primary system and you're on the Secondary system, you don't want the Secondary system to - to sense an overcurrent and shut down. And we're gonna pull these circuit breakers to make sure that that control system continues to function.
Okay. That's always the case. I just wondered if there was some reason that you were suspicious that might be more appropriate thing to say this time.
Negative. We don't have any - any evidence that says that's likely to happen or any more likely to happen.
All right. Is that the - that's the context of the changes?
That's affirmative.
Okay. Now let's take it from the top.
Okay. About a third of the way down the page then, we want to add, "PUG Mode, Aux; Oxidiser Flow Valve, Normal, Secondary." And in a comment, we want to add - "Do not ...
Would this be - Is there something different about this than what we've done here - for all of the other burns?
I think just the "PUG Mode, Aux" is the only change.
Okay. You want to go PUGs, Mode to Aux. You want to leave the Oxidiser Flow Valve in Secondary. And the position of the valve in Normal. Is that correct?
That's affirmative. And we do not want to move the Oxidiser Flow Valve during the burn.
Okay.
Okay. Then nine lines from the bottom, where it says "Set GPI trim, verify MTVC," we want to add the words, "Except Yaw."
Roger.
Okay. And seven lines from the bottom, we'd like to add "Circuit breakers Pitch 2 Battery B, Open, and "Yaw 2 Battery B, Open."
Okay.
Okay. And on the back of the page, after the "Delta-V Thrust, two, Off," we want to close those circuit breakers. That's Pitch 2 Battery B, Closed, and Yaw 2 Battery B, Closed.
Okay.
Okay. That does it for the cue card.
All right. Give me the Flight Plan now, if you will, please.
Okay. At 198:40 in the Flight Plan.
All right.
Okay. We want to add a waste water dump to 10 percent.
Okay. We'd have gotten that down further, but we just - just couldn't get it all done the last time.
Okay. And that's somewhere between the P52 and AOS, anywhere you want to stick it.
Okay.
Okay. And at 199:45 [199:33]...
At 199:45 [199:33], we want to add ...
Don, you gave me that at 199:40, didn't you?
Negative. That ...
You gave me that waste water dump at 199:40 or 45?
Negative ...
You had me -
... It was 198:40 [198:28] on the waste water dump.
Okay. That makes more sense. Thank you.
And at 199:45 [198:33]...
All right. Go ahead.
At 199:45 [198:33], we want to add "Load EMP 509."
Okay. "Load 509 at 199:40 [199:28]."
Okay. That's 199:45 [198:33]. And now I've got the preliminary TEI-64 PAD.
Go ahead. Over.
Some chicken soup?
Mm?
...?
Yeah.
... the last one.
Yeah.
Okay.
Chicken soup. I get you some meatballs with sauce; you got some instant breakfast; you got some orange juice.
Okay,
Okay. Preliminary TEI-64, SPS/G&N; 38332; plus 0.61 plus 0.95; 200:33:20.44; Noun 81's plus 3265.6, plus 0808.0, minus 0215.1; 180, 000, 000; HA is not applicable, HP plus 0021.7; 3371.0, 02:42, 3351.7; sextant star 23, 183.7, 37.5; boresight star is not applicable; Noun 61's minus 00.72, minus 156.04; 1049.4, 36277; 265:49:12.

Under other: number 1, PAD based on TEI REFSMMAT; number 2, sextant star not available until 200 hours GET, and we do not have a single-bank burn time for the preliminary PAD. We'll get you one for the final PAD. And we're about a minute from LOS now. You can try a readback if you want.
Okay. Pre-TEI-64, SPS/G&N; 38 ...
3833 ...
38332; plus 0.61, plus 0.95; 200:33:20.44; plus 3265.6, plus 0808.0, minus 0215.1; 180, 000, 000; plus 21.7; plus 3371.0, 2 minutes 42 seconds, 3351.7; sextant star 23, 183.7, 37 and a half; latitude, minus 7.2, minus 156.0, 1049.4; 36277 ...
16, Houston. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Pete. How are you?
Loud and clear.
Okay, Houston. The gyro torquing angles on the P52 option 3, with the star angle difference all balls, minus 0.032, plus 0.001, plus 00, - plu - excuse me - plus 0.034. And that was at a GET of 198:24:35. And those angles were so small they weren't torqued because we went into the Option 1.
Roger.
And, 16, I've got a map update - rev 65 - at about - 200 hours 30 minutes in the Flight Plan. TEI -.
Okay.
Okay. It's around 65 instead of 76. And the numbers are 200:07:27; 200:31:33 [200:19:43]; with TEI, 200:43:09 [200:31:19]; without TEI, 200:52:48 [200:40:37].
Okay. 200:07:27, 31:33, 43:09, and 52:48.
That's affirmative.
(Laughter) I would suspect that you can probably throw this one back in that jett bag, too, then. There. Thank you.
And, Ken, you're on air to ground.
Thank you.
Okay, 16. I've got some numbers on the RCS Delta-V. I believe they're at 200 hours and about 15 minutes in the Flight Plan now.
Okay. Go ahead now.
Okay. Pre-TEI, you've got 75 feet per second; post-TEI, you've got 111 feet per second.
Okay. Pre is 75 and post is 111.
That's affirmative.
And, Ken, have you got a couple of minutes to listen to a few words about servo loop.
Okay. Go right ahead, Stu.
Okay. That's a real good system you've got on your second loop. We have got the simulator swinging right with the characteristics of your spacecraft. And this is the way it's going to look to you if you have to use it. Prior to ignition, the gimbal is going to be oscillating plus or minus - approximate - at about a degree - 0.9 - something like that or, in other words, 1.8 peak to peak. But once you get Thrust On, there's a side load on your bell from the LOI burn, and this side load acts as a damper. Since the load is cyclic, it really doesn't matter which direction the load is; it damps out. Under CMC control, it will damp out in a few seconds and burn very steady. In SCS, Auto, it damps almost immediately and then is steady throughout the rest of the burn. In Rate Command, however, since you're continually pulsing it with an input, it continues to oscillate pretty much at this same magnitude, or amplitude, throughout the burn. However, as far as you controlling it, it really doesn't matter. However, sitting in the simulators we don't get the real live shake effect that you're going to get. The spacecraft is going to shake and shudder; however, your attitude will remain virtually unchanged. And, I guess, the only advice that I could say would be that if you download - if you could go to SCS, Auto, you would save those excessive clutch currents that you get under Rate Command with this continual oscillation. And I guess I'll stop there, if you've got any questions.
No, that sounds - that's good information, Stu. I'm glad to hear that. Do you - you got any cute tricks in the back of your mind on how you can download from Rate Command and then go back to Auto without getting a big transient due to the mistrims?
No. I - I think - now I tried it - purposely having at least, say, a degree mistrim and - when I would switch, and you'll get the transient, but the bell will - will steady out. Now, I think going ahead and flying it in Rate Command is - is acceptable; however, you are - you are getting the bell oscillating, and you are putting, you know, the currents through there. This attitude...
Okay. I get the - Sounds like - if you could - you could damp the rates - damp the oscillations quickly by getting it into Rate Command - I mean the - Auto and then use the old thumbwheel procedure to change the pointing accuracy if you aren't pointing in the right direction.
Yeah. You - you don't have much control with that - with that thumbwheel in - in the Auto. I think, probably, I would take it in Rate Command, go back to my attitude, recycle my BMAGs, uncage them again at my - at the attitude I wanted, and then accept the trim - the mistrim in the - in the gimbal and - and let that damp out. I think you're going to be hard put to try to guess - guess your thumbwheel setting. However, let us think about that a little bit; and, also, I'd like to say this has been checked. I talked with North American this afternoon. This all agrees with the hardware evaluator, as far as our characteristics, so I think we're pretty close to your spacecraft.
Okay. That's outstanding. Sounds like you guys have done a mighty thorough job. My first choice then would be to - I think, based on what you said right now, just do the natural thing and take the oscillations unless they're excessive, and look - just download in the normal manner and ride it out.
Okay. That sounds - I think that's very ...
So, as the first choice, I think we'll do the normal thing and burn CMC.
By all means, yes. CMC is - is prime, or you can - you can download ...
Yes, okay.
... You'll be in Rate Command, and you will have the bell shaking. It'll start to damp a little bit; but every time you hit with an impulse, why, you'll excite the oscillation again.
Okay. Thank you very much, Stu.
Roger.
And one other thing, Ken. After convincing you that that system is - is real good, which we believe it is, we'd like to say - and I'm - I'm assuming that you would do this anyway - that if everything isn't checking out real good - primary system-wise or anything else, you'll just come around and let us take another look at it.
Yes, sir. if there's any problem with the primary system or anything abnormal, we'll come around and talk it over.
Okay. Very good.
16, would you verify BMAGs in Rate 2.
Will now. Thank you, Don.
Roger.
And, 16, if you'll give us the computer, we'll up-link a state vector and the target load for you.
You have it.
Roger. Thank you, and go Auto on the High Gain.
16, we'd like to go to a different configuration on the cryo O2 Tanks 1 and 2, Auto, and Tank 3, Off.
Got it.
Okay, 16. It's your computer, and I've got the TEI PAD any time you're ready.
Okay, Pete. Go ahead.
Okay. TEI-64, SPS/G&N; 38332; plus 0.61, plus 0.95; 200:33:20.42; plus 3264.4, plus 0809.9, minus 0225.7; 180, 000, 000; HA is not applicable, plus 0021.7; 3370.9; 2:42, 3351.7; sextant star 23, 183.7, 37.5; 013 - stand by 1 - down 09.6, left 3.1; Noun 61s, minus 00.72, minus 156.04; 1049.4, 36277; GET 265:49:12.

Okay, Pete. We copy. TEI SPS/G&N 38332; plus 0.61, plus 0.95; 200:33:20.42; plus 3264.4, plus 0809.9, minus 0225.7; 180, 000, 000; NA for HA; plus 0021.7; 3370.9; 2:42, 3351.7; 23, 183.7, 37.5; 013, down 09.6, left 3.1; minus 00.72, minus 156.04; 1049.4, 36277; 265:49:12.

The readback's correct, 16.
Okay. Thank you.
And, 16, I've got some block data, TEI-65.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. TEI-65, SPS/G&N; 38332; plus 3.61, plus 0.95; 202:32:31.35; Noun 81s plus 3337.3, plus 0869.0, minus 0183.4; 180, 358, 001; rest of the PAD is NA; set stars Sirius and Rigel; 118, 311, 007. Two jets, 17 seconds; use quads Alpha and Charlie.
Okay, Pete. We copied TEI-65, SPS/G&N; 38332; plus 0.61, plus 0.95; 202:32:31.35; plus 3337.3, plus 0869.0, minus 0183.4; 180, 358, 001; NA, rest of the PAD; Sirius and Rigel; 118, 311, 007. Two jets, 17 seconds, Alpha and Charlie. Over.
The readback's correct, 16.
Hey, Don. Could you have someone check on the proper exposure settings for CEM film for post-TEI?
Will do, Ken.
Thank you, sir.
16, I've got about four more updates to the Flight Plan, any time you want to copy. At about 200 hours and 43 minutes is the first one.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. There's a list of items at 200 hours and 43 minutes, and we want to add to that list "Pan Camera V over H override to high altitude."
Okay, Pan Camera V over H to high.
And at 200 hours 46 minutes, we want to change from "Barber pole plus three steps," to "Barber pole plus two steps."
Okay. That's plus two.
Roger. And at 200 hours and 56 minutes, we want to change from "Gamma Ray, Deploy" to read "Gamma Ray, Deploy to 8 feet," and that's "59 seconds."
Okay. Gamma Ray, Deploy at 8 feet, 59 seconds.
Okay. And at 201:082 we've got "Maneuver angles to Moon UV attitude are roll, 174; pitch, 212; yaw, 64; and the High Gain Antenna angles are Pitch, minus 73; and Yaw, 12."
Okay; 174, 212, and 064 for the attitude, and High Gain, minus 73 and 12.
Readback correct, and that's all the Flight Plan updates we've got right now.
Okay, Don. Down here where it says "Pan Camera, Mapping Camera film should be expended," I'm gonna let those things run until you guys tell us that you're either tired of taking pictures or something, because we're not going to run out, I don't imagine - at least not at this point.
Okay, 16. Understand the Pan Camera will probably run out, but the Mapping Camera may take quite awhile.
Okay. I suspect it's probably to our advantage, even though the cutter works good, that we probably ought to go ahead and run it out. That's your call though.
Okay, 16. I think that's what we plan to do.
Okay.
And, 16, it'll take about 3 hours to get rid of that mapping camera film, if we run it all the way out.
Okay. Is that what you want to do or did you want to just go ahead and cut it tomorrow? It's no difference to us.
We'll let it run out, Ken.
Okay.
16, can you verify that the sub-satellite deployed on time?
[Garble].
How's it doing?
Okay. I guess we're not able to see it until the LM electrical power runs out.
Yes, sir. It went on time. Of course, it was in the dark and we couldn't see it to verify it visually, but - all indications were that everything was a normal deployment.
Roger. Understand.
And you can tell all our friendly G&Cs there, Don, that I don't understand it, but in 100 seconds, EMS now only shows a 0.2 change, which looks like the EMS gets better as time goes on.
Roger. Understand you think the EMS is getting smarter.
Houston, is it okay for 16 to go to the burn attitude?
Stand by one. Okay, 16. You can go to burn attitude.
Okay. Thank you, sir.
16, would you verify Limit Cycle switch, Off.
No. As a matter of a fact, it's on right now.
Okay. We'd like to have that switch Off, please.
And, 16, we'd also like you to verify once more, although we're sure you're going to do it this way anyway, that you're going to leave the Optics Power switch on during the burn, because that will decrease the probability of the - of the glitch occurring.
Okay. I didn't realize that it would. We would have left it on, but thank you for telling us.
Roger.
Okay, 16. I've got those camera settings for after TEI. Can you tell me you're ready to copy?
Go ahead.
Okay. For the first 15 degrees past the terminator, the settings are 5.6, 1 over 125, and infinity; from 15 degrees to 30 degrees, it's 5.6, 1 over 250, and infinity; and past 30 degrees, it's 8, 1 over 250, and infinity.
Okay. Thank you, Don. The first 15 degrees, it's 5.6, 1/125; and, from 15 to 30, it's 1/250; and, from 30 on, it's f/8 and then 1/250. Thank you.
Roger. And just a couple of additional comments here. The P20 attitude is going to differ slightly from what you've got in the Flight Plan, due to the fact; that we're using a different TEI REFSMMAT. It's a very small change and probably not very significant. But we didn't want it to surprise you. And the TEI rev is different, of course. That's going to give us a slightly different terminator, so we've been advised that you can turn the Mapping Camera and the Pan Camera on a couple or three minutes early, if you'd like since we got a lot of film.
Okay. We'll put those things on as soon as it's practical. And you - did you want to change the Noun 78 load, or are you just saying that that will give us a different set of gimbal angles?
The Noun 78 load is correct, it'll just give you a slightly different set of gimbal angles.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger.
And the 509 flag is set.
Roger.
And, 16, you're Go for TEI.
16 is going for TEI.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. We have a successful star check.
Roger. Understand successful star check.
That's affirmative.
About 45 seconds to LOS. See you coming home.
Roger.
TVC Servo Power 1, Servo Power 2, done. Rotation Normal, number 2 to AC, the Direct 2s are Off. BMAGs, three, to 1/2. Spacecraft Control going to SCS -

Start the DET again at 58. No, I think I'll catch it at 57. Give it another try.
John, there's old Orion out there.
Okay.
Okay. Good, Charlie.
Burn time is two minutes and ...
Forty-two ...
... 42 seconds.
Okay. And that means I go to 2 seconds overburn, and shut it down.
Okay, I'll give you the normal countdown, Ken.
All right, sir.
Starting at about 35.
That'll be just fine.
Okay.
Okay, the GDC looks like it's - pretty much - I'm gonna dress it up. [Garble] has nothing to do with the uncaged gyro. It's the attitude reference. Okay.
It counted that time.
Two minutes. It's working now.
Okay, Charlie's got the watches?
Yeah.
Okay, we've done everything down to here.
Two Jets, 17 seconds. Our A and C [?].
Awful quiet, isn't it?
Okay.
Okay.
Delta-V to normal.
Delta-V is going to normal. Translation Control power is on. Hand Controllers are in neutral; they're both unlocked.
Okay.
Delta-V thrust, and the light is out. Okay, it's coming to normal.

Okay.
PUGS is looking good.
Steer, baby, steer.
Chamber pressure is riding at 98.
Okay. Helium tank pressure's - I mean - tank pressure's looking great. Steady as a rock.
On 30 seconds -
Mark.
Okay, calling two minutes and eight seconds to go. Okay.
Looks good from my calculation.
EMS and VT to go are right with each other.
Okay. The gimbals are nice and steady.
Okay.
It's just this - Boy, you know, look at those rates. Imag - imagine what that would look like if you're - really had the thing swinging.
The roll has increased ...
Coming up on a minute -
Mark.
Okay. Chamber pressure's up to 99. Reading almost half a g.
This PUGS and AUX is glitching, I guess every time it goes by a point sensor, it ...
Yeah.
... glitches. It's okay.
Yeah.
Both attitudes are steady as a rock, 18 per cent.
Coming up on 01:30...
Mark. 01:30.
Right on.
Okay. We still have 2 minutes to go.
Chamber pressure steady. Got a little buzz.
Should be a minute.
Twelve percent.
Chamber pressure's increasing.
Tank pressures are rock solid, Ken.
Okay.
Mark. Two minutes.
Boy, that burn time is right on.
Right on the burn time. Okay. We have less than a minute, and we're still right on.
Yep. Two attitudes ...
We are.
... are sitting perfect. We're up to 100 psi chamber pressure.
EMS looks good.
01:15.
For some reason ...
01:25 -
Mark.
... this thing is cycling - well, it's cycling in roll. I've never seen that.
Yeah.
01:30. 02:30 -
Mark. Thirty-five, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42.
Shutdown.
SPS Pressure light.
Okay.
41 ...
Okay. Right on.
... 3371 point ...
Wait - wait - we've got to get the attitude stopped here. Why don't you go ahead and Pro?
Pro.
That'll put me back in Narrow Dead Band and hold it.
Plus 0.2. Plus - plus 1.2 ...
Dead Band.
... plus 1.
And after that, an attitude of 184.28, 5.82 ...
- point one and the drogue? What, sir?
184.28 ...
I got it [garble]
... 5.82.
Okay.
351.69.
Okay.
Okay, now what's the rule say on trim?
Okay, trim X and Z to less than 0.2.
Okay. We got only Y.
Ready. Get it.
My Delta-V C is minus 19.1.
Okay.
That's about right.
Okay, let's get the gimbal motors off. Let me get my circuit breakers ...
Go ahead. You get your breakers.
Got them. Main B.

Anybody get that?
No.
[Garble] ...
Have you got the fuels there?
... residuals.
Yeah.
Okay.
EMS Function, Off, and Mode to Standby.
Yeah, I'll just leave it here because that'll keep quiet in here.
[Garble]. Have you got the Direct Rot Control, On?
Okay. I've got those two Off; and this is back; these go to Rate 2.
Okay. Main Bus Ties are Off.
We got those. You got the Bit Rate back to Low?
Sunrise!
Okay.
Okay. You got it.
Check the SIM bay.
All right.

Mono, okay, go.
Got the Power to Power.
Power to Power. Barber pole.
Okay.
She's gray.
All right.
We'll put it to On as soon as we get in attitude.
Take the Pan Camera V/H Overide. See that switch?
Yeah. It goes there.
Okay. Put it to High.
Okay. Just a second.
I just got three pictures of it.
Hey, you got the one with the Earth in it?
Yeah.
Beautiful.
16 Houston. How do you read?
Hello there, Houston [garble] [Mattingly: "[Garble] Hello, there." in CM transcript.]
Man, you come up like thunder. Wowee!
Okay, is the mapping camera out yet?
Yeah, it says barber pole.
All right. The burn was nominal.
Barber pole. Still barber pole.
Let me get this [garble] before [garble] ...
Okay [garble]. operate it, though.
[Garble] this book here.
16, I can't make out the words. We can hear you calling.
Roger. [Garble.] [From the CM Transcript: "The burn was nominal. We had - we just saw you rise."]
Roger. Understand.
He already knows.
We got a high - we got a high gain angle?
Not until we get there. I - I think I set it.
Well, what did - what did you set it to on this, Ken ?
On what?
This camera.
What are you taking pictures of?
[Garble] the Earth, and then me.
1/250, f/8.
There's Omni Delta.
Charlie, what's that result again?
I'm just about pitch and roll.
Oh.
When we get to attitude, it'll be Pitch, 45; and Yaw, 320. It's set. I don't see how that's gonna work; it's not looking at the Earth [garble].
Me, either. What is it? Just targets of opportunity out through there?
Man, we are climbing out.
16, Houston. Let's try it again.
Do you read us now, Don?
Roger. You're a lot better now.
Roger, just saw you come up like thunder, and that's how we're coming up. Just going away from it like - nothing.
Hey, look at that beauty out there. Isn't that something? It's [garble] ...
Roger.
It's better than an AB climb, Pete.
Roger. Understand.
Okay, Charlie, how about the Mapping Camera. Is it out yet?
You have the burn status report, Charlie?
Yeah, it's out.
Okay, would you put the Mapping Camera to On?
Mapping Camera's going On, right.
Okay, Pan Camera to Operate.
Operate.
[Garble].
That came off.
Okay, Image Motion to Increase.
Okay.
[Garble] plus 2.
[Garble] ...
You have ...
... [garble] barber pole plus 2?
You said it. One -
Barber pole. One - Got it.
Okay, have you got the Pan Camera to V/H [garble]?
Yeah.
Okay, I'll pick you up the status report. Why don't you get this one? It's all on the same page here.
Okay. Okay, that's right.
Then I'll get one.
Okay, Houston. We're working some mapping stuff. The burn was completed nominal. We'll give you the status report in - just as soon as we finish.
Look at that horizon thing, would you, you guys!
Wonder if I can get that DAC on this thing.
Yeah, why don't you get the status report; I'll try to get the DAC going.
Okay.
John, [garble].
Here. Take the pictures, Charlie.
Roger. Give me a window.
Okay, I think we can get it out of that one.
Try the f/8, that one? Hold me.
Okay, now don't - don't stop it down any more.
Okay, Houston. Burn status report follows. There is no Delta-TIG. Burn time, 242.4. There was no trim. And the residuals were measured at 184, 005, and 351 degrees; 0.2, VGX; 1.2, VGY; 0.1, VGZ; all pluses; minus 19.1 Delta-VC.
The -
3.9 is the oxidizer and 5.2 is the fuel.
Roger.
Man, did that beauty feel good! Ah! Must admit I feel good enough to [garble] ...
It was really beautiful; that baby just hummed right out of there.
That's great, John.
She can really put on the power. It's - it's kind of refreshing to get a whole half g from her.
Roger.
How about let me use the center window for a second?
The boys are all at the windows taking pictures.
Roger.
Get a pan.
We got - we got some pictures of earthrise as we were climbing out. I bet they're really spectacular.
Roger. Hope they come out nice.
This Moon is really - is really a fascinating satellite. Boy, there's something new and different, and - and you can sure see a lot of variety from this view right here. This is almost ...
Look at that!
This is even more spectacular almost than the Moon - than the Moon in earthshine when we're coming in here just ...
Boy, you can see old Neper and all that stuff.
... 5 days ago, or however long ago it was.
Roger.
Let's see, am I looking north or south here, Ken?
North is that way.
Okay. I'm looking north. This is beautiful! You really get the idea it's a planet. It's just a -
Look over here.
I think the general agreement in the cockpit is that morale around here just went up a couple of hundred percent.
Roger. Morale looks pretty good here, too.
Hey, are we in SIM bay attitude?
Yes, sir.
Got to have the High Gain.
(Laughter) How can I come around with a P00?
[Garble]
Can't believe that'll work yet.
[Garble]
Okay, I'll let you back at the -
Yeah, I can get that [garble].
Thank you.
Hey, Houston, how do you read on the High Gain?
You're loud and clear now.
Okay. I missed your last thing; we're switching over.
Roger.
We're now getting a view of - on the horizon, and there's Crisium. Way up north there, Charlie.
Hey, Charlie, be sure you get the florals [?] down there.
Right down there? Yeah, that's what I been doing.
No, wait a minute. No ...
I didn't see anything.
I don't think that's what I'm talking about.
Right down here?
This stuff over here. All those - take a strip that runs right out through here.
Okay.
And ...
Oh, yeah, yeah. I see it.
That stuff?
Uh-huh.
16, we need a Verb 58.
And - Yeah, it does keep on coming down here.
Yeah.
You can take a strip starting at the top of it and then come all the way to the bottom.
You want a Verb 58?
That's affirmative.
Is that what he said?
I don't know.
What does that do?
Oh, I guess I didn't stop it in time.
Didn't stop it in time?
I'm going - going to attitude. And - [garble] That's the problem with that program.
What's that?
That thing goes off to - to play with itself and then manuevers - at 15-minute maneuvers; but you got 8 seconds at the end. If you don't hit Pro on it, it stops right there and it won't keep the rate drive going.
No, but you have to watch it; it's okay.
That's just spectacular!
Well, I told you if you watch it. But you got to sit there and watch it. Which I ain't - guess I haven't ...
At 10-minute intervals?
Huh?
At 15-minute intervals?
No, if it takes you 15 minutes to get into attitude ...
Oh, by then you got to - you got to hit the maneuver when you get there. Yeah.
Whenever it gets through with this, 10 seconds or 15 minutes.
Yeah.
You got eight seconds grace.
Should give you a tone warning or something.
Yeah.
Look at that. Isn't that something, you guys?
It really is.
It is really ...
I don't care. I'm sorry E.V. [?] isn't getting his pictures. To heck with that. (Laughter)
Go ahead. I wish we had [garble].
Hey, Pete, this is really a spectacular view. Wait until I get the camera clear.
Boy, Pete, this is really a spectacular view. Really get the curvature.
Tell us about it.
Yeah, the old crescent Earth coming up there.
Boy, look at it. There's old King right down there, the old crab.
See it?
Yeah, I can see it.
The - the earthrise was just beautiful, and it just ...
Well, you look like [garble].
... came up like gangbusters. We were looking right out the window ...
Right down here.
... and there you came, and right now ...
[Garble] are?
... you're a - almost a - just a crescent Earth, just a very sliver out there. And I tell you, we can hardly wait. I know we got a couple of things to do before we get there, but we're looking forward to it.
Roger.
Did you tell them about sunset?
What about sunset?
I - I mean Earthset? Did you tell him about that? No?
No. What about it?
I - I just want to try it.
Tell him.
Earthrise. Take a look now.
[Young in Tech transcript] Houston, another great view that we had right before TEI was your - your prime Earthset. Your crescent was - your - the lit - light crescent of the Earth was tangent to the lunar horizon. And, as you went down, you ended up looking like a ...
I bet you'd like [garble].
... big bull horns up there.
Look at all those swirls.
Yeah, why don't you get some of those? I -
Roger. 16, let's go High Gain, Auto.
I have made it.
Thanks.
High Gain to Auto.
You have it.
I don't think that thing's gonna work. It's beeping.
Thank you.
That's the antenna. Well, increasing rate. Isn't it?
It's like a billiard ball. That's what people can't understand, how flat and round it -
And my TSB has got a red stripe on it. Will you put some water on it and - and throw it across, please? Just -
Houston, we now have, looking out the center hatch window, the whole - the - the Moon fills the whole window. I can see from horizon to horizon by just being about four inches from the center hatch window. What a spectacular view.
Roger.
That's from horizon to horizon along the equator. And we are really climbing away from the planet. You can just see it getting smaller by the second.
You're really moving out, huh?
Yeah. We're - doing just like old 97, really really moving down the track.
Roger.
Almost as fast as John was driving that Rover yesterday.
Roger.
Pete, out of Window 5, I can already see the whole sphere.
Roger.
I just can't get these new guys away from the windows.
Roger.
That view is just beautiful.
And, 16, we're showing the Image Motion, On, and we'd like you to go Off, if it is On.
Okay. That's in work.
Roger.
Don, I'll have to stop the camera and start it again. Is that okay?
We concur, 16.
Okay, Don. I've got the camera running again. What barber pole setting did you want on the - on the speed?
Barber pole plus 2, 16.
Okay. You've got it now. Is there anything else we have out of configuration?
I think not, but stand by a minute.
You know, you can sort of sense a - From where we're looking right now, you can sense a swingout in this big arc back toward the Earth. I'm looking right now at my 12 o'clock out the hatch window. Seems like we're almost climbing right away from the center of the Moon. And I can see the whole - Mare Crisium is spread out up to the north, and on our groundtrack, well, just north of our groundtrack, you can see Messier A and B Craters and Langrenus.
16, we can go ahead and get the Gamma Ray deployed to eight feet. That's 59 seconds.
Okay. I'll do that. Eight feet to 59 seconds. And this is the one place we can get a good view of Humboldt that we got on our first pass there.
Roger.
Okay. Don. You want those deployed for 59 seconds. Is that affirmative?
Roger.
I guess in SIM bay attitude, the only thing we have been able to see so far is Sea of Kovalsky, and Charlie said he got a view of it out his window. So I guess we've - just about now we're able to see the whole Moon. Boy, we're really moving away fast.
Roger.
That's the whole Moon out - out a window. Back from it about two inches.
Okay. The Gamma Ray is out.
Roger.
From this distance, the color is very much the same as it was when we were orbiting it. And that is that no three men on any one crew can agree on what the color really is.
Roger.
Looks like to me, Pete, that the mare right now just picked up a bluish-black cast to them.
Charlie, these maria are brownish-black casts.
John says brownish.
Roger. Understand a bluish-brownish black cast. You guys have invented a new one this time, anyway.
That's right. We'll get Ken's opinion. Standby.
Pete, did CST come back with anything on those wrist rings?
Stand by one, Charlie. We'll check on it.
You know, as we move out from the Moon, I think that by looking at the varied structures on the surface, that we can see from here, I guess my impression of it is that the Moon may be 4 billion years old plus, but it sure had a - and it may eventually have stopped growing after the first 500 million or changing dynamically, like the Earth changes, but during that first 500 million years, it was certainly busy cause it really has a lot of variety down there, and we haven't even begun to scratch the surface of com - complexity of the story. That's my personal opinion.
Roger. Charlie, on the problem with the rings, I guess we don't really have an answer for you, and we may get some more in the morning. But there's no apparent good way to do anything about that. We don't have a cleansing agent or a lubricant that we can use on them. I guess you'll just have to use more force on them.
Fine. With - we can get them locked with a little force, and they pass checks okay, once we get them on.
Roger.
And, 16, I've got a couple of Flight Plan changes for you at 201:30 [201:18] and 201:35 [201:22].
Okay. Wait a second.
Roger.
Can you stand by just a second on those.
Sure can. Just call me before you do the Verb 49. We've got some attitude changes.
Okay. We won't go anywhere.
Okay, 16. The Verb 49 at about 201:07 [200:55] in the Flight Plan, for the UV photography, should have been started, oh, about 10 minutes ago.
Okay. We'll go to it now.
Roger. And it's correct as you have it now.
Okay, Don. This is the 174, 212, and 64, right?
That's affirmative.
And, 16, we've got a REFSMMAT, if you're ready to Accept?
Roger. Stand by on that for a second.
Roger.
And, 16, if you can copy, I've got this Flight Plan update; I guess we need to go ahead and get it in.
Okay, Don. Give me 30 seconds.
Roger.
Okay, Don. Go ahead with your updates.
Okay. I've got this Verb 49 maneuver that's at 201:30 [201:18]. We want to change that from a maneuver to thermal attitude to a ramu - maneuver to Sco X-1 attitude. And the angle - the new angles are at 347, 071, 000, and the High Gain is minus 36, and Yaw is 176. And we also want to add Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover, Open, at that point.
Okay. And we've got a Verb 49 maneuver to Sco X-1 and the attitude is 347, 071, and 000. The High Gain is minus 36 and 176, and we'll open the Alpha/X-Ray Cover.
Roger. And at 202:25 [202:13] -
Okay. Just a second, I had - we hadn't updated our time this far. Well, we're going to get a clock sync here when we ...
Okay, Ken. I wouldn't bother updating the time very much further because you're going to do a clock resync here at 202:20 [202:08].
Okay. Well, I stopped an hour too soon.
Ken, all you really need to do is, in the old ...
All right sir.
... going by the old numbers where it was 224:18 or so, which is now about 202:25 [202:13] or so, we want to delete that Verb 49 maneuver. And at 202:25 [202:13] or thereabouts, we will resync the clocks, and that'll bring you up - the clock'll come 226:30, so we'll pick up with the nominal Flight Plan, which will have you going to bed a couple hours earlier tonight.
Okay. Very good. Thank you, sir. Okay, and then what do we do about this - can we do our PTC REFSMMAT change at the same time we're in this attitude?
Say again?
Can we do our PTC REFSMMAT change while we're in this Sco X attitude?
Oh, I'll have to advise you, Ken. Stand by a minute.
No, sir. I'm timing it.
16, you can go ahead with the maneuver. You'll have about a 68-degree gimbal angle.
Say again.
And, 16, we need to up-link a REFSMMAT to you before you get into the P52.
Roger. You have the up-link now.
Okay.
I guess the question - I'm not sure if we got the right question and answer together. Can we do the PTC REFSMMAT platform change in the Sco X-1 attitude? Maybe that's the question you answered, I'm not sure.
16, the answer to that apparently is yes, but you will wind up with a 68-degree gimbal angle.
Okay. Did you plan for us to do it some other time? Or -
Oh, 16, if the 68-degree middle gimbal angle is acceptable to you, we would like for you to go ahead and press on with it.
Okay. We'll do that, and that'll get us back on time. And we're looking at a 64-degree angle now, so 4 more isn't going to be that different.
Roger.
And, 16, we're finished with the up-link.
Roger.
Ken, we want the Pan Camera to Standby and you can deploy the Gamma Ray boom the rest of the way out.
Okay, Pan Camera to Standby and we'll deploy the Gamma Ray.
Okay. The Gamma Ray's going out.
Roger.
Okay, 16. Go Pan Camera, Power Off.
Okay. Pan Camera Power's coming Off.
And 16, there's an advisory - when you do it - going to the P52. You'll probably get a 401 alarm, which means that you've exceeded 60 degrees middle gimbal angle. You can go on with it, anyway.
Okay.
Okay.
16, Houston. We've got some words on the LiOH canister any time you're ready to listen.
Stand by one, Pete. Ken's eyeballing it.
Roger. There's no hurry.
16, did you call?
No, sir. Be with you in a minute.
Okay.
Okay, Don; go ahead.
Okay, on the LiOH canister, the words we got on it are that we'd never had one of those straps break on a flight unit. However, apparently if you put more than 128 pounds of force on them you - you can break them. And what we'd like you to do now is go ahead and change - make that change so that we don't miss it when we do the clock sync. I believe it's listed at ...
Now, Pete, that's some good thinking. Yes, sir; I've got it at 202:20.
Roger. And we were afraid we'd get the clock ...
... get that out of the way.
Okay.
Say again, Don.
I'm just saying it's up close to the time we're gonna sync the clocks. We're afraid we might omit it.
Yep, that's good thinking. Okay; while we're changing that out, if you want to - you want to do your thing with the computer, or do you want us to do the P52 first?
Stand by one.
Ken, you talking about the clock sync?
Yes, sir.
Okay, I guess we'd like you to do the P52 first.
Okay. We'll get on with that in just a minute as soon as we get the [garble] changed here.
Hey, Pete, y'all got any ideas why old Orion didn't hold attitude jettisoned?
I guess I don't have a complete briefing on it. We've got a couple of suspect conditions. I'll try to get back to you later.
Okay. No hurry on that one.
Roger.
Hey, Don, in order to keep our lithium things from driving us buggy on the way home with the time change, we're just going to go ahead and exchange the canisters as they're called out in the Flight Plan here. And we'll just be skipping the couple that'll be unused. Okay?
Okay. That sounds good, Ken.
Hey, Pete, is Tony coming on tonight?
That's affirmative. About midnight, I guess. About 2 hours and 15, 20 minutes from now.
I guess that's after - after we go to bed?
I believe that's right, Charlie.
Good, 16. We copy the torquing angles. They look real good.
Okay. That was at time 202:03:00.
202:03:00. Roger.
Don, how long we gonna be in this attitude?
Stand by one. About 30 or 40 more minutes, 16.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, Houston. Would you like to take over our clock?
Stand by. We're just about ready to do that.
Okay, 16; if you'll go Accept, we'll uplink this clock sync. And while they're doing that, I'll tell you kind of what's going to happen. But - We're going to do it. The total change will be 24 hours 34 minutes and 12 seconds. And what we would like you to do is on, let's see here, Page 338 in the Flight Plan, we'd like you to pick up at about 226:30 in the Flight Plan ...
Hey, Don, (laughter) I'm sorry you're gonna - Hey, Don, you're gonna have to start over again. Just as you started talking, our cabin fan let out a great big moan, and so we turned it off then, after all sitting up straight to see what it was. So would you start over again?
Okay, I'll do that. If you'll go Accept, we've got the clock sync ready to go, and it'll be a 24 hour 34 minute and 12 second total change in the clocks. And what we would like you to do is pick up the Flight Plan at the old - at the old point of 226:30, actually pick up those events, although your clock may not come out exactly on that time. And what we're saying is we may cut a little bit into your rest period.
Okay; but we're planning to do a little stowage here that we never have had a chance to get done.
Roger.
So we're going to have to do some of that stuff now.
Okay. The items we'll pick up with, I guess, are the ones immediately following 226:30 [201:55]in the old Flight Plan.
Okay.
Okay. Ken, your clock should be changed now. And if you'll pick up with - on Page 338 where it says, "Gamma Ray, Shield Off," you can go ahead and finish that stuff up.
Okay. I take it we're gonna hold off on this PTC for a while until you've had enough time in this attitude?
Stand by one.
Roger. We'd like to stay away from the PTC for about 15 more minutes.
Okay; we'll do that.
Okay, 16. We'd like you to close the Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover now, but we want to leave the X-Ray on for an extra 30 minutes because we failed to get some calibration data, and I'll call you when it should go off.
16, did you copy on the Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover?
Roger.
Okay. We want to get that closed and leave the X-Ray on, and I'll call you when it should go off. About a half hour from now.
Okay, I closed the cover.
Okay. And, also, we'd like you to read out Tephem for us. That's Verb 5 Noun 1 1706 Enter.
How's that look to you, Houston?
Stand by one; we'll take a look at it.
Okay, 16. That looks good.
That's three balls 11, okay.
Okay, 16. On those numbers you've got on the DSKY there, if you'll go to the G&N Checklist, Page 9-4, you can load Register 2 and 3 in column Bravo, Lines 4 and 5.
Okay, G&N Checklist, 9-4, what - load what?
Load Register 2 and 3 in column Bravo, line 4 and 5.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 16; over.
Go ahead, 16.
Roger. We're gonna go ahead and service the accumulator to - to 55 percent if that - that's all right with y'all.
Stand by one. Okay, you can go ahead with that, John.
Trying to - okay, we're trying to get as many of these nitpickies out of the way for this EVA tomorrow.
Okay, and in connection with that, the surgeon advises that the CMP will need a new biomed harness prior to the EVA. We do not have any requirement to monitor the CMP tonight. We would like to monitor either you or Charlie.
Roger.
Okay; we decided you can look at me tonight.
Okay, John.
I'll put on a biomed tonight, but I've got a bunch of things to do before - before I can get to it. Okay?
Okay, sir.
Pete, looking out of the hatch window towards the -back at the Moon, I think this view's even getting more stunning, and - just brilliant whites and grays against a stark black background - looks like it's not even real.
Roger.
Hey, Pete, how far out from the Moon are we now?
How far out from the Moon?
Yeah.
Stand by a minute.
Charlie, you're 7,294 miles out.
Thank you.
Hey, Pete, we'd like to send you a picture of this if y'all got - can take the - the TV. This is really a spectacular sight.
Okay; stand by, Charlie. We'll see what we can do.
Charlie, while we're working that, can you copy about four short items into the Flight Plan at 226:40?
Yeah, wait a minute.
Charlie, you can go ahead and start getting that camera out. We'll work up the lines here.
Okay.
Okay, 226:40 [201:53]; go ahead.
Okay; at 226:40 [201:53], we want to Retract Mapping Camera, Close the door, put the Mapping Camera to Standby, put the X-Ray to Standby, and then pick up at 226:50 there in the Flight Plan.
Okay [garble].
Pete, did y'all copy that?
Negative. I guess we lost comm there temporarily, Say again, Charlie.
Okay; you gave us a Flight Plan update for 226, and our clocks now say 227 ...
That's affirmative.
... 23.
We're going to have to go back to 226. It's just prior to where you go into PTC and pick up these four items, and then get into PTC.
Well, why don't you give us a call when you want us to do those, since we don't know when 226 is.
Okay.
Is 226 right now, there, Pete?
Say again?
226 is supposed to be right now?
Negative, negative. Right now we're showing 227:44:07, 8, 9.
Okay, but I mean you're saying what - When do you want us to do those items at 226?
We'll call you when we want you to start in. That's just where we want you. That's the items we want done and then I'll tell you when to start them.
Okay.
Okay, 16; I'm - 16; I've been advised it really doesn't matter when you do them, as long as we get them all done before you go to sleep.
Okay.
Houston, you're saying we can - we're now cleared to take the Gamma Ray, Shield Off, the X-Ray to Standby, the Alpha/X-Ray Cover to Close, and so forth, right?
That's affirmative.
Pete, could we take the S-Band Aux switch out of SCI to get the - monitor set up?
Stand by one.
Okay, 16. We need to get the Mapping Camera, Off - Stand by. Get the Mapping Camera to Standby, and the Gamma Ray, shield on, prior to going out of the SCI position.
Okay. The camera has retracted. We're gonna go to Off on the Mapping Camera, and the gam - and the shield is on.
16, want the Mapping Camera to Standby, and the Gamma Ray, shield on.
Okay. Yeah; okay.
Okay. Can we go to TV?
Affirm. You can go to TV.
Okay. I'm gonna have to hit a Command Reset. Is that all right with Super Tech - Comm?
Stand by one. That's affirmative. Go ahead.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. You should have a picture coming now.
Roger.
Does that look like the Moon to you, Houston?
Not yet, I guess.
Charlie, we'd like you to verify that you've got that camera pointed at the right one this time.
I happen to be not pointing those cameras this time.
They don't let - We don't let Charlie make that choice any more; Ken's doing that kind of work now.
Roger. Understand. It's a beautiful picture, Charlie.
I tell you - yeah. And it's just about that big, too, from where we're looking. It just - just fills the window just about like that.
That's really a great looking -
Are y'all getting it real time?
Affirmative. We just happened to have the lines up for au LCRU picture, so we're getting it real time.
Ah, great.
Is the LCRU still working?
It was last night, they say.
I'll be darned. Did they watch lift-off and everything?
Affirmative. Had a beautiful lift-off. Got to watch all of it almost.
How much did you see, Pete?
We got to see about the first 30 or 40 seconds of it real good.
Hey, great! That's wonderful.
That was something. I guess we'll have to tell you that was spectacular, because you didn't get as good a view of that as we did, I guess.
Man, I tell you. That ascent engine coming on, you - you - it was a real - It wasn't what I expected, anyway. At ignition, there, it seems like it sort of sits a little bit, then it grabs you and, boy, off you go! And it takes you a while - at least, it did for me - to get my eyeballs uncaged. And we were - then all I saw out the window was the MESA blanket; then we were back on the gages.
Roger. It looked like you lifted out of there pretty rapidly.
Yeah; that machine just flies so nice. It's just unbelievable! But once you get to ascent stage, it's really light and responsive. Boy, you fire one of those thrusters and it does exactly what you want it to.
Roger.
And this is what you look like after 4 days with no shaving.
Roger.
And we refuse to show you the pressure suits.
Roger.
You can tell Charlie's real adapted to zero gravity. A couple of days ago, he couldn't spin that pencil.
(Laughter)
It takes us country boys a little while to adapt to things, Pete.
Right. I'm with you, Charlie.
You know, Pete, if you took this view that y'all just saw of the Moon and put in a movie, everybody would say you're faking it. It doesn't look like that. And it's just - you can't see any stars, just pure blackness, and that white-gray body sitting out there is really -
This is what the well-dressed LMP on Apollo 16 has been wearing for the last - well, ever - all the way out and all the way back.
If y'all get tired of looking, you can just cut off the lines or go to Command Reset or something.
Roger.
One final shot of the beautiful Moon.
Roger.
Say, Charlie, why don't you try to give us a close-up of each guy, and maybe we can get a playback for the wives tomorrow.
Okay; we'll do that.
You want - you want [garble].
I think if we get in the LEB [garble].
[Garble] always work [garble].
That ain't [garble].
Okay; we got it off. We'll turn - bring it up in just a second.
Roger.
All right, you guys [garble].
(Laughter) [Garble.] Boy, you know, I think this is [garble] picture.
Huh?
Huh?
[Garble].
I know it. (Laughter)
[Garble] like that, you could go all over the country.
[Garble] Flight Plan right in front of you.
Yeah, [garble].
Are you?
Huh? Yeah, I'm trying [garble] (laughter).
Oh, yeah. Don't want to waste any time.
This is the relaxing attitude for the world - for the seasoned space traveller.
Boy, I can hardly believe the last 3 days, Pete. That was - The Cayley Plains is really the most fascinating place I've ever been in my life and will ever hope to go, and we sure had a good time collecting all the rocks.
Roger.
Shift.
Ken. I'll let you look at somebody else now.
Charlie, everybody else is doing a mental interpolation. The Surgeon's standing on his head.
You say - what - what was that?
[Garble].
(Laughter) Okay.
I said everybody in the MOCR is doing a mental interpolation except the Surgeon, and he's standing on his head.
(Laughter) Okay. That's great.
(Laughter)
Hey, tell him ...
Okay; Ken just turned the camera over, you can have him turn the other way now.
Roger. (Laughter) I'll have him ...
But then the rest of you will stand on your heads.
Okay; I don't know if you can see this or not. See this dirty hand?
Oh yeah, we can see that.
See that? Can you see the dirt under those fingernails - can you see the dirt under those fingernails?
Roger.
That's Moon dust. You talk about a - you talk about two dirty human beings. It took 10 minutes before we could get Ken to open the door. As soon as he saw us, he wanted to close it.
Roger. We understand. He runs a neat ship.
And we're still that way. Yeah, wait'll you see some of these rocks. And we've - and some of the data that Ken's got. That's really something. The Moon around Alphonsus. I got a chance to look at it today for the first time, and - it's really - it's really a strange place. How's everybody doing down there at MCC. Is everybody starting to take it easy for a change?
Oh, I think we're all breathing easy now. And if we can, we'd like to get a quick look at the CMP because we're going to have to give up the lines here in a couple of minutes.
Okay. Will do.
Excuse me, Ken.
The only - the only really neat guy on the crew.
Huh? [Garble].
[Garble].
What'd you say? You must be blind.
He does dress pretty well.
Notice the reflection off the bald head?
Did the Surgeon do a back flip on that one?
Negative. He's not agile enough.
Ken doesn't look like he is either.
(Laughter) I told you, in a J-mission spacecraft, you - you either have to be a midget to do that, or have thought about it a lot before you try it.
Okay. We're going to sign off here.
Here comes the lens cover.
Okay. Thanks a bunch, guys. We'll being talking to you again in a minute.
Okay. Thanks, Pete. We'll go back to SCI on the S-Band Aux.
Okay. And for thermal reasons, as soon as you can, we'd like to go on now and get into PTC.
All right. We'll start up.
We're for that.
[Garble], Ken.
Let me move out of here, T.K. Okay. What'd you have?
What's happening down in there?
Say again, Charlie.
Get any newsy items for today?
No. I guess we don't have anything going on right now, Charlie. Everything's routine. If you want a news report, we can dig one up, I think.
No, it's not important. Wondered what - We haven't had an update for a while; y'all must have ran out of paper.
How does the midcourse look, Pete?
Stand - stand by one.
Okay, 16. All we have is the G&N data. We don't have tracking data because you are uncoupled. However, based on the G&N data, it looks like less than one foot per second.
Yeah; but - course, I - Yeah, I forgot us - about us being uncoupled.
Doesn't look like anything very big. About a foot per second.
Yeah. Well - I - the G&N - thought it did a good thing.
Yeah, we concur. G&N looks great.
Houston, 16 on Omni Alfa. Over.
Roger, 16. You're loud and clear.
Okay. We dropped up-link, it looked like, for a while. Signal strength went to zero on all antennas, and I had a Command Reset, and we're Omni Alfa, if that's okay.
If you'll go Pitch minus 70 and Yaw 130, we can reacquire on the high gain, 16.
In where?
Okay.
Okay. There you are, Pete.
Okay. You're loud and clear.
Okay. Charlie, a little while back, you were asking what time Tony was going to come aboard, and he's just walked in here and gotten plugged up if you've got anything for him.
Okay. Say again.
Earlier you were asking what time Tony was going to come in, and he's on board right now.
Okay.
Hey, Tony, this is John. Over.
Yeah. Go ahead, John.
I don't know if we told you or not, but Charlie and I think you really did one whale of a job doing those EVAs. We know how tough that is to do all those real-time changes. We just thought you did one heck of a good job, and we sure appreciate it. Just wanted you to know that.
Oh, thank you much. But you guys made it awful easy.
Hey, Tony. I was sitting here today thinking about those rocks we got, and the thing that really strikes me is that there was - I really don't think we got any volcanic rocks to speak of. Maybe some of those little black clasts were volcanics, but otherwise - I don't think we got any. There wasn't any there. The - there was one other - one other point that could have been - Those ones we were calling shocks could have been a tuff breccia, since they were so friable. But - that we might - that might prove to be the case; but to us, they looked shocked due to the other features that we saw that - that - applied a shocked metamorphism. Over.
Right. We - From your description, we had thought there was a good chance that you might have gotten a tuff breccia there. I think, also, the fact that a lot of the breccias were one-rock breccias would in - would mean that you may have your basalts or gabbroic anorthosites or whatever, and that they're just broken up. If they're one-rock breccias or two-rock breccias, it still has most of the information of the - of the rocks we're looking for. It's not like a - you know - if you remember, it's not like a soil breccia, where everything is lost. So we - we're very happy with what you found. Also, did anyone brief you on the newest on the X-ray results ?
No. Go ahead.
Okay. You remember the first look I gave - The first look that I reported to you indicated that the aluminium-to-silicon ratio was sort of intermediate. Well, they've gone back; and with the newer data and a better analysis, it turns out that Descartes has one of the highest ratios on the Moon. The only place we've seen like it right now is on the east side of Smythii. We don't really have a good comparison yet with the east of Crisium. But anyway, it indicates that if any place has anorthosites, you've found them.
I tell you, Tony, some of those rocks that we picked up - I was leaning, with the color and the crystalline structure that we had - they really gave me the - I didn't want to call it that, but they were certainly crystalline rocks; and there was no question in my mind. They had a sugary texture - the whitish ones. That big - one on the - rim of North Ray, there, with the shatter cone that had - a - a bluish tint to it in the crystalline structure. Although, it might have been just the - an aph - I say crystalline structure, or it might have been an aphanitic matrix; but y'all are gonna sort all of that out when you get bagged ones. I tell you, it really wasn't what we thought - I thought we were going to find up there. I imagined a lot of volcanics; and frankly, if the - if these shocked rocks turn out to be tuff breccias, that will be the only volcanics we found.
Right. Understand. I think ...
[Garble].
...the fact that you recovered from the picture we had given you before you went and went ahead and found out what was there and sampled it so well - I think that's - a good indication that the training was good and you guys are really on the ball.
Well, we tried hard, anyway, Tony; and I think we got every - a piece of every rock that was up there. I really do. They were - and that's, I think, because we were lucky, and the rocks were identifiable.
You know, the ...
[garble]
... difference between a rock being identifiable and not being identifiable is the level of training. That just says you guys are well trained.
Well, you guys tried to beat it into us long enough, I'll tell you that. Hope we did a good job.
I just got a set of questions that the geology team ...
It looks like ...
... would like to send up to you sometime. Maybe sometime during the Trans-Earth coast, we'll have a chance. I haven't really read through them, so I don't know what they're all about yet.
Okay. Well, we're gonna go into an eat period and a an EVA prep and try to get some rest before the EVA tomorrow, so - we'll wait on those. Okay?
That's fine. Hey, we have the TV back on on the Moon up there, and everything's looking fine. It hasn't changed much since you left.
Well, we were glad that y'all were able to watch lift-off. We heard that they got about 30 or 40 seconds, which, I think, was neat. It took me about that long to uncase my eyeballs when that ascent engine lifted off.
(Laughter) Yeah. Great.
It certainly wasn't what I thought I was going to - experience.
Yeah. INCO was really on the ball. They tracked you right up.
Well, that's just super.
I don't know - We don't know whether Ken understood the up-link while ago on the biomed harness. The idea is that he's going to have to change it before the EVA in the morning. So, if he'll sleep better without one on tonight, he could take the old one off, now.
Okay. We'll tell him.
And, Tony, the only - on that - on the rocks, back to one other little point, there. That - You know, we called the whitish rocks tuff breccias- I mean, shocked rocks. But we're cou - at least, I'm personally convinced that there are at least two endogenic craters that we passed, and - the big one on the way to North Ray and the big one coming back from - from Stop 8. And so, that might have been a source of a tuff - if that's what they turn out to be.
Very good. I just want to emphasize again that ...
[Garble] situation, though.
Right. I understand. I just think it was outstanding, maybe serendipity, that we probably - your landing there at Descartes probably sampled the most differentiated place we could find on the front side of the Moon. I think that's really outstanding.
That's the feeling I got when we started seeing those rocks. That - that basalt that I called under the engine bell there, I think, might end up to be that blackish-bluish rock that we sampled up at North Ray, and so - we'll - but we'll see. We couldn't get any of what I call real basalt in rocks. Maybe some of the clasts will be, though.
Okay.
Could you tell from the TV, Tony, how rough that place was? Could you see all those - those swales and valleys that we didn't have mapped on our - that didn't show up on our map that were maybe, some of them, 30, 40, 50 meters deep?
Yeah, I sure could. It reminded me of a dune area.
Yeah. That's what it sort of looked like, sort of a dunes plains.
Incidentally, somebody here is kind of worried about ...
I'll tell you...
... thermal problems, and we would like to get into PTC as soon as possible..
Okay, as soon as the thing - as soon as the rates get low enough, we will.
Okay.
Are the rates good enough now?
Negative.
Tony, that one - that crater at - the endogenic one that we described coming back from North Ray and going out, it - I was guessing 80 meters, John said about 50, but it was really deep; and I'm surprised that we didn't - I sure had no feel for that before we started.
Right. Understand.
I'll tell you one thing, your hair sure doesn't feel very good aft - up here after 3 days with it full of orange juice.
I don't know. It may do great things.
That stuff is great glue, I'll tell you. Boy, we were really worried about those hel - getting those helmets off, but they came - came right on off after we eventually broke the thing and got them cleaned up then.
Okay, and on your Flight Plan there, at right about 227:00, for setting up for PTC, I guess your DAP has to be set up for B/D Roll.
Okay.
Houston, can you give us a holler when these rates get good enough to start PTC?
Sure will.
Apollo 16, last time you changed the LiOH canister, did you happen to wiggle the other one and see if it had swelled up in there?
No, we sure didn't. That one out of B just came right out.
Okay.
Okay. Don't worry about it, then.
Okay.
Just a brief report from the home fronts here. Everybody's healthy, and happy, and not just little bit proud.
Boy, you had me worried there for a second.
Thanks, Tony. Appreciate it.
Okay, Apollo 16. You've got a Go for spinup.
Okay. Thank you.
