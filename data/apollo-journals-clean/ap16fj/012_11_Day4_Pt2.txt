Charlie,.
This where we here?
Yeah.
Yeah. You can turn it on.
Hey, we got something in that kit that'll clear your sinuses up?
Yeah.
Actifed.
Afrin.
you squirt in there to...
Yeah, I need to do something; this thing's getting worse.
Well, we checked the switches three times. I guess it wouldn't hurt to check them again. (Laughter) Okay. Popped.
It's on Panel 229 over there, Charlie. It's...
I ain't heard a thing pop.
You ain't heard nothing pop?
Interplanetary LOS plain.
Well, that'll.
Okay.
Say that did kind of head out?
Ooh. I think I was right.
What's that?
That guy had died. My nose ain't that stopped up. All that goes through is the odors, no oxygen.
Whew! I see what you mean. That was me.
Well -
It's not...
Send that out of here.
Smells a long time. You guys are putting that on the tape, too.
(Laughter)
Just be glad they don't have a gas inlet around here.
That's right.
Oh, machine, do your thing. I won't badmouth you for being a marshmallow again.
Okay. Coming on two minutes.
daylight, we'll see it.
We going to burn, we come into daylight.
Yeah.
Don't look.
No, don't look, we got too many - too many things going bad for us to look this time. Look after the burn. Get right there and then you get. Phew!
Okay, gonna do it right in one minute. Stand by.
There it is.
One minute. EMS.
Translation Power, we don't need. The light is out. Delta-V Thrust A is coming on -
Mark.
Okay.
DSKY blank.
Okay, average g is on. It's counting. Looks good, though.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 - 50 99...
Pro.
Pro.
Took; 2, 1...
A's open. SPS - Okay, lights are out.
Okay.
Pressure's looking good.
Stable. Bank B.
They're open.
I felt a - seemed like they dropped.
Where?
Pressure is 90 on the gage.
Pressure's looking great here. Helium valves are open. PUGS is looking good.
I can feel that sucker bring that second bank on.
Yeah, I felt that, too.
Okay. We - I see it in the reflection in the LM windows.
Keep your eye on them, babe.
I am. I got them, babe.
What was the alarm at the start?
It went out, whatever it was. I think it was a overpressure on the SPS; now it's back nominal.
Okay.
Okay, fuel's running a little low. It's running about 165. Coming up on a minute.
Chamber pressure's staying, and - coming up a little bit, maybe. Up 92.
Mark, one minute.
Okay. Doesn't register on the g meter (laughter). Okay, gimbals are still steady.
Okay. Stand by -
Mark. Loose limit.
Chamber pressure's going up a little.
Yeah, I gave you bum dope. I was calling that 90, but it was 95.
Son of a gun.
Inside.
Inside.
130.
That's really 96 psi on the chamber pressure.
PUGS is looking great.
Attitudes are holding. How do the two Delta-Vs compare, John?
Delta-Vs compare pretty close, as matter of fact.
Measurables. I mean, to go.
Yeah, yeah.
About ten.
Yeah, ten apart. Lot closer than in the simulator.
Okay.
Mark, two minutes.
coming down.
Trim's. Chamber pressure, 97.
Okay. What's the cut-off?
BMAGs look good.
Four - about 04:15.
Four - yeah. 04;30.
04:20, actually.
Yeah. You're gonna make me nervous.
When I say what?
Mark; 02:30.
Okay.
CMC's right on, with my time. PUGS is about 100, unbalanced, and holding. Decrease.
Looks like it's working, doesn't it?
Man, it sure does.
Okay, coming up on 3 minutes...
(laughter). Chamber pressure...
Mark.
78.
Okay, we got 150 on the PUGS, unbalanced, decrease.
Okay. Don says that if we watch it go, it'll go down to about - almost 200 and then work its way back up.
Okay.
Okay. Three minutes. Right on time.
Man, that thing is - their prediction is right on this.
Yeah.
Isn't that beautiful?
heard of it.
Okay, coming up on 03:30.
EMS and the Delta-V to go are right together. Perfect.
Mark; 03:30.
Chamber pressure's at 98.
Stand by for the tight limits -
Mark. Tight limits. We're at 200; unbalanced; jiggling around a little bit; decrease.
Okay,.
Coming up on 4 minutes. SPS pressures are rock solid.
Mark; 4 minutes.
Inside (laughter).
I'm not, I'm looking at the gages. I was having a little bias back there. Okay?
Okay, and now for.
Stand by for crossover.
EMS and this thing are right together. Couldn't be any closer.
It looks like we've had crossover.
Okay. My chamber pressure very smoothly increased to 100.
Okay, and the unbalance went a back - that's jiggling around on zero. Stand by.
Mark; 04:30.
Man, that mental machine.
Keep doing it, machine.
Coming up on five minutes.
Mark; five minutes. Unbalance is 150, decrease. Looking great.
to go.
Helium's down to 1800. Nitrogen's looking great.
Man, that time is gonna be 06:14.
Sure is.
Casper, you're gonna lose your bar.
That's really spectacular.
Okay. Stand by, on 05:30.
Mark; 05:30.
At shutdown, maybe we can get another light.
Yep.
Okay. Rock solid. Thirty seconds.
Not gonna get there early. Got ten seconds overburn to worry about.
Yeah. 100, decrease, unbalance, looking super, 40 percent. Six minutes...
Mark.
06:05...

RCS pressure.
RCS pressure.
It's okay.
Okay. Two, three...
It went high on the...
four. Okay. We've done our thing. We didn't get anything here. You want to...
copy those numbers? Two, 3, 28039.
Yeah.
Okay. What, 28039?
Yeah, 28039.
They're okay.
Okay.
Plus 0.2, minus one -minus zero, minus one. We got to look at 1620, right?
5-5.
1620.
You're not gonna trim.
No, but...
Okay, get the - Delta-Vs now - I mean, Delta-V, 20.
That just call a Noun 20?
Yeah, Verb 6.
Okay. Enter. Okay, now let's - Roll's fine...
02. 35799.
Yes.
Plus 26.8.
Yes.
That's good. You get that?
Good, yeah. Let's go with the gimbal motors.
Okay. Wait a minute now. Let me see if we got everything here. Gimbal Motors, four, Off. Okay. Main B.
Go.

EMS Function, Off. Standby.
Standby.

(onboard): Att Dead Band to Max.
BMAGS, three, to Rate 2. Bus Ties are Off, Charlie?
Yeah.
Okay, the Bit Rate...
Going Low.
Okay.
Hello, Houston. Sweet 16 has arrived.
Roger, 16. Copy you loud and clear.
Okay, Pete. Super double fantastic burn. If you're ready, I'll give you a burn status report.
Okay, go ahead, John.
Okay, Delta-TIG was 0615 burn - 06:15.1 burn time, plus 2803.9, trim; residuals, plus 0.2, minus zero, minus 0.1. Delta-VC is minus 5.5; fuel, 376, Ox, 371; 150, unbalance, decrease. Okay, at ignition, we got a momentary SPS light; then it went out. During the burn, the Oxidizer pressure read 200. The Fuel side was a little bit low, and it was about 165 on my gauge. After shutdown, the Fuel side climbed to 170. The Oxidizer went to about 202 with an SPS light, and we've still got it. Over.
Roger. We copied everything except the roll, pitch, and yaw, which was blacked out by some noise.
Okay, the trim attitude - we did not trim. The residuals were as we gave you after the burn. Our attitude was 005, 358, 002. Over.
Roger. We copy.
And it was a slight transient, when the second bank was lit, that I don't remember from previous burns. You might look at that data, but it was super.
Rog. Copy.
And it appeared to me that the chamber pressure had dropped off just as we brought the second bank on.
And as you can see, we're in 170.4 by 58.3 according to the old computer, and that baby just rifled it right down the line.
All righty.
And everybody is looking out their window. And right now, we're looking right down at Crater King, and it's just as fantastic as it always has been.
Roger.
You can see those little dark - those little dark - look like volcanic black spots up - up in the north sector of it, and you can see the central peaks with a - with a varied - very white central peaks covered by lighter gray - gray-brown material that sort of looked like somebody painted it on there with a - with a - with a paintbrush.
And, Pete, your first view at Tsiolkovsky out of my window is pretty - it's a spectacular sight; the way that - looks like a marshmallow float - a central peak floating in the top of a hot chocolate.
Yeah, you - it - it's like - three guys - they've each got a window, and we're staring at the - at the ground. It's really - Boy, this has got to be the neatest way to make a living anybody's ever invented.
Pete, 16 here. Another pretty sight we had before burn was the Earthset. It - really quite a view.
We're all sitting here listening, Charlie. Tell us about it.
Pete, you got - a - Mapping - or the Pan Camera Power's - is On?
Okay, Pan Camera Power, On.
How'd the S-IVB look?
It hadn't happened yet, John. It's about another - nine minutes or so.
I - I trust we're not getting there the same time it does.
I trust.
Okay.
It - it's going to hit on the southwest corner of Reinhold, Ken.
Say again, Pete.
Tell Ken it's going to hit on the southwest corner of Reinhold. He should know where that is.
I'm sure he does.
Okay. Let me get the binoculars out here - playing with them there. It's pretty interesting. I tell you, all that time spent with Farouk sure is going to pay off, because it does look like old home.
That's good, Ken.
The lawn needs mowing and all that.
Okay, Casper, Pan Camera Power, Off.
Rog.
Pete, looking out at the horizon, you can really tell you're in the highlands. The horizon is really jagged looking.
Looks like coming up on the Rockies, huh?
Of course, we're start - we're starting to come up over the flatlands now, over the Smyth Sea. I remember a landmarking track down there on Apollo 10. It's still there. You can't really tell by looking at it that the Smyth Sea is any - any deeper or lower than the data shows it is right in the surrounding terrain.
Roger.
The submerged craters in Smythii remind me a lot of a - coral atolls. They just got the ridges sticking up, you know, and the - and the bottoms of them appear to be flooded with the same material that's in Smyth.
We're digging out a map now, 16, to take a look at it.
We're going to get a close-in picture of Humboldt here, as we come up, because we'll probably miss it on the next round.
Roger.
That's real - it's really a fascinating crater, the way the dark mare has got in - sort of like a path around the edges, and - and there's a fracture pattern running across it, and it has some very prominent central peaks that are very white. But it has every contrast and color on the Moon.
Roger.
Boy, those fracture patterns running down through it are white - appear to be white, layered fracture patterns. They look like somebody's drawn them on there with a piece of chalk.
S-IVB has impacted.
Okay.
Houston, out my window is fine now. We got Petavius with it's central dome of - a whitish cap - dome, and it's a fairly subdued crater. The lineations running into it - the rilles or whatever they are - are just like it's drawn on the map here.
Some of those central domes are exceptionally dark, and they have exceptionally dark material running down a white surface. You can see that.
With the binoculars, we passed over Langrenus, and you can see blocks on the tops of the central peak, and some features that probably are there that I just haven't noticed before in that central feature. You can see an awful lot of - looks like a - the demarcation where the central feature - looks like a crack in it - has a whole ring of craters that kind of dots that boundary. And then, you see some more of those little craters up along near the top of the central lineament also. And you just don't see those kind of things stand out at you without the binoculars.
Roger.
I could also say that the binoculars at ten power is the maximum you can hold in your hand. You got to get yourself set up very nicely for it before you start.
Roger.
And we're coming up over the Messier A and B Craters.
Houston, we're coming up on Theophilus now. Central peak's in the shadows, and the - As we approach the terminator, looking out towards the horizon, it really looks rugged.
Roger.
16, if you'll give us the computer and go Accept, we'll give you a REFSMMAT.
You've got it.
Just now looking at the Altai Scarp and, boy, it's well named in this lighting.
Roger.
Looks like the walls are vertical. I'll admit the lighting exaggerates it, but that's how it looks.
Roger. Copy.
And, 16, we're finished with the up-link.
Okay, back to Block.
You want to do one?
Huh? Do I?
Well.
You should be able to. Be right at the terminator.
Right at the terminator, huh?
Yeah.
Trouble with the terminator, this Moon is so ragged, I can't - do it even. I'll get a decent terminator shot.
I'll take care of all that. Okay, there's Taylor, Taylor A Zöllner - then we have to have Descartes. That is Descartes, right there. See the -?
Where?
Right down - Here, let me - get to this window; I'll show you. Right there? The crater Descartes.
In this lighting, you can see the Crater Descartes, and it stands out much bigger than you would expect, because of the low Sun angle. And - in fact I had to look into my map in order to make sure that was what I was looking at. And the material that runs out of it - that - that's in the area, are the things we talk about as being that bright reflective area, in this low Sun angle, has a much blockier and jumbled appearance than it does on any of the high-Sun photographs.
Roger.
It looks very much like looking down on a clinkery - a big clinkery cinder field, but on a much larger scale.
Roger. Copy.
Yeah, a big - a rounded surface of clinkers. It's fantastic. Boy, is that rough!
Okay, Houston, as we look to the west and to past the terminator, there's - a couple of degrees past the terminator, there's one bright spot, a peak standing up which is west of well, west of Kant.
Charlie, you're fading out.
Really high ground. Say again.
Right after you started talking about this peak and you said something like "west of," you faded out.
Go ahead, Charlie.
Yeah, the general opinion here is that we may be looking at part of Smoky Mountain sticking up through some - through the shadows.
Houston, 16, FAO advises you've got some extra film on Magazine UU - that's VHBW, and you can use it for targets of opportunity, and you can use the CEX exposure graph and stop down one stop from what you get off the graph.
Okay, I hear you.
And, Casper, on that last transmission - As an example, f/11 for the CEX, you should go to f/16 to use with Magazine UU.
Okay.
Don, I'd like to verify how we're going to do the P52 again now. Any ideas that we'll go to place the SCS Controls into Rate, High, and Deadband is Min. At the proper time, I'll - I've got the BMAGs in Rate 2, I'll go to SCS Control, and then I don't have to worry about loading 509. And I'll just go ahead and do the P52. And then when we're through, I can go back to CMC Control. Is that correct?
That's affirmative.
All right, sir; thank you.
Hey, Don, we're trying to set up the - the camera for the next terminator and sunrise, and I thought I understood what you told me about the settings, but I guess I don't. Can you run through that again? I guess I just as soon have you just give me the proper settings.
You're talking about this Magazine UU that I just called up?
Yes, sir; the VHBW.
Roger; stand by.
Ken, they - they're get - looking that up for us right now. And in the meantime, I'll try to give you the rule again. Maybe that'll clear it up some. You can use that CEX exposure graph that you have on board, and take the readings off of that.
Rog.
And then simply increase the stop number one stop. For example, if the CEX exposure graph calls for f/11 and you're gonna use the Magazine UU, you should go to f/16.
Yeah, okay. I - I thought - I - You used an example; I thought you meant that specifically, and I couldn't make that correlate. Okay. And Charlie says this magazine is HBW instead of VHBW.
That's affirmative; he's right.
And, Casper, for the terminator photography on the next rev, we're recommending you go ahead and use Magazine SS. That's Sierra Sierra.
Okay; use the one we had planned on.
That's affirmative.
Okay, thank you.
And, Casper, that call on Magazine UU; we meant to impart to you that you can use that for targets of opportunity.
Rog. Okay, thank you.
Right.
16, put the High Gain on Auto.
Houston, did you copy our torquing angles?
Affirmative. We got them.
Say again, please.
Affirmative. We got them.
Okay, Don; one comment. I'll try again and take a look at the optics in the - when we get out into the double umbra, but right now in that telescope, I - I can see the stars now, but I still can't see star patterns. Like we looked at - at Antares - and you just couldn't see the Scorpion at all. And that may be due to the extreme amount of Earthshine that's being reflected off of the LM. That LM is like looking at it almost in daylight, and, good gosh, the - the Moon looks like you can see everything on there just like - it's really bright.
Right. Okay, Ken; we understand.
16, we're about a couple of minutes from LOS. Everything's looking good, and while you're behind the Moon, we'll change shifts and pick you up on the next rev.
Okay. We sure enjoyed it, and we really appreciate all of the things that you guys are doing to get us into orbit here. Man, I don't - That's the kind of help that really does it for us. Thank you much.
Roger; thank you.
Well, I guess that - that sort of makes six days of PTC not so bad.
Let's see, I ought to be able to do both of these at the same time, or can I? Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Both of what?
Both these dumps.
separate.
What time was our - AOS - I mean, sunrise?
Sunrise -
Just look at the Flight Plan, there.
You hope.
We got to get going here, I'll tell you.
Well, we've got at least 20 minutes, Charlie.
Charlie,. Okay. AOS LOI, 74...
No, no, no, no. Look at the Flight Plan where the column stops. It goes from black to white.
Oh. Okay. 76:18.
Sunrise?
I don't know. No, it's...
76:28, man.
No, couldn't be.
Well, it - if it goes to black to some other squiggly line, what is that squiggly line? It goes from black to a squiggly line. Okay. And then it becomes full sunrise at 76:35.
Okay, what settings do I use on this color? I don't see how this can show that terminator with color film.
Have any?
Em.
No, you admit my ability to read the chart. It's wrong. (Laughter) One small step for mankind, here. What do you make it out to be, Charlie?
76:28.
Is that when it gets daytime? Or get sunrise?
That's our sunrise.
Our sunrise. Well, that can't be sunrise, man. He ain't gonna believe that. That's because you're looking at it, which you ain't gonna ever see again. Every time we did this on Apollo 10, a Fuel Cell light came on; every time we. And I was totally ignorant of what the fuel cell, in here somewhere.
Where are the scissors?
I put both pair down there in the.
Here.
Okay. That's what we need to know.
Did we stop logging our intake and all that stuff today?
Yep. Did that this morning. I mean, after the first. What time did they say we get the AOS? About -
He didn't say.
I never said.
Neither did the ground.
They're supposed to give us a Rev 2 update for that stuff, and they did, didn't they?
No, I don't think they're supposed to.
Start coming out.
Yep. It's altered in the Flight Plan.
I guess this is the real crux. If you don't get around on this rev, they've really screwed up.
We had terminator I'm supposed to take a picture of.
Then what?
Yeah.
You want me to take a picture of Crookes or not? I - I...
Go ahead.
I.
I don't want you to take a picture of anything asked...
asked us to ask you to take a picture of it.
Oh. He did. Okay,.
Please tell those guys - please tell Ken...
Exactly what he said.
that...
We're sorry he doesn't want to.
What he said was, "I'd like to get a picture of Crookes." He said, "There's a possibility that you guys may be able to pick it up, depending on whose window you're sitting in at the time. I know Ken looks at it, but I don't know if you do or not; but if you happen to be sitting there and it comes around, why don't you get a picture of it?" That's what he said. On account of something, I forget what.
I'm proud of you.
Now, how about putting the 250 lens on there?
Okay. Is that our waste water tank?
Yeah.
Still got 20 percent more to go.
Don't - don't (laughter).
I'm not able to tell that they're doing any of that.
You're right. That's a - that's a rather startling sunrise, isn't it?
Waste water 20.
Okay, it's on, Ken.
You want to get over here, Ken?
It's out of this window. Crookes's supposed to be.
It should be out - out of here or there, either one. This seems to be fine.
I have one at.
Okay, we got our fuel cell purge now?
No. I'm gonna start it right now.
Okay. Let's see, get - get the - Suppose we could use Magazine SS? That other one.
That one's the magazine you want to use for this?
Yeah.
Okay, and this is gonna be seven six. Okay SPS pressure.
Going up, you mean?
I put it to acknowledge because it was on continuously. Must be. It looks like it's gonna go higher. It's about 210 now.
Well - Yeah, if the light was on, though, it should come back on again.
It may have gone off from being cooled down.
Yeah. Okay. Probably.
Take a look in there. The condenser's normal.
Starting to open the purge. Maybe we better turn off the waste water dump.
Okay, I'll get it. What's that?
Fuel Cell 1. Okay.
Have you already done the...
It's did with the purge.
Oh. All right. Okay. Okay. This is off.
Okay, right at ten.
Man, we are streaming out a lot of particles with us. Okay, this terminator's coming up, Ken.
Okay. I'm coming. Well, we're not gonna be directly over it until about 34, which is two and a half minutes.
You wouldn't believe all the particles we've got.
Look at that one. Real pretty.
I'm gonna let you get the I'll get the
Well, it's not clear to me we're gonna get anything here.
That's really spectacular. Oh, this is beautiful! Contrast.
H2 purge, Master Alarm.
that one.
See it coming, Ken?
Get these. I'm not sure it's - Harry wants pictures of stuff like that. Get one here of this - these guys right here in the bottom of this thing. That should be.
Look at the depth of that crater!
Except for the full Sun, it makes it look very - very...
A lot deeper than it is.
picture.
on?
No. Thank you.
Here's where they turn into hills.
take a couple of pictures here. Excuse me.
Sure.
There's that central peak in Icarus.
Have you got Icarus?
Right out there on the right. You didn't see that, Charlie.
Oh yeah, I see it, It's taller than a - There it is. Right there. See it?
It isn't really taller,
Right out here. Right on - almost on horizon.
Yeah.
Okay, Charlie.
Why does it look rounder coming around this way than it does when you go into the terminator; it looks straight on the other side.
There's some suspicion that there's a different material.
All right. Just wanted to ask. Did I say the middle of Icarus looks like a big volcano? Couldn't.
What did you call it? Icarus?
Yeah.
H2 purge, Master Alarm.
Let's see, we're about 37:06 and there's -
What's a flashing 37 doing there?
Ken will figure it out for you.
out there.
Looking at the Moon hurts my head. I won't look at it. There's too much down there I don't understand.
Charlie, just keep on the book.
That's why I'm purging the fuel cell.
Oh.
I tell you, when we get down to eight miles, we're gonna really look like we're down among them.
Sure are.
What PTC, Ken?
Yeah.
Okay. Get back here, Charlie.
Okay. I guess I can turn that purge - that waste water dump off.
Stuff is coming out, Ken.
It is?
Yeah.
Okay. Our waste off.
Okay; we get the AOS at -
It really fires thrusters.
firing thrusters.
Uh-huh.
Yeah. What do you - what made the comment that you said was really firing one of the thrusters?
Oh.
Yeah.
Well, I don't know. I don't know.
They all look different to me when I go hanging upside down.
I know they're not supposed to, but they sure do.
Sure do.
Look at those little tracks down there running in between these two craters.
big blocks.
Seen with the naked eye from 60 miles, they've got to be big.
They're really big.
Which one are you looking at?
Oh.
And it has a ray.
I have to agree that the back side is rather monotonous looking, although I'm sure each one of these craters tells us something, if you're smart enough to know what's going on.
Wish I could clean this window.
Isn't that terrible? Wonder how that happened?
I don't know. It's on the outer pane.
Yeah. Inside of the outer pane.
Yep. It really makes a difference with the binocs.
Yeah.
Man, those are huge features.
What gets me is the ridge - is the - is the ridge line rou - around Man, there is just not a flat place anywheres. Do we go over Gagarin?
No.
I didn't think so. We're coming up on something like Mendeleev now? Probably?
Uh -
That big flat thing right there.
Looks about right.
You want to get a picture of the Sea of Moscow? Anybody gotten any good pictures of it?
we have enough Sim.
AOS? Maybe we should turn this thing off before AOS.
The dump?
Yeah....
Am I looking up north for that?
You're looking up north. Yeah, you're looking north.
Is there still stuff coming out of our dump?
No. It's about to stop.
Okay.
Want me to get a picture of it on the right?
Sure.
It really makes a - Give - give me a thing.
Okay.
What should I take it at?
I don't know, John, I'll have to go and see, here.
This can't use 250 at f/11?
I'd better dump it.
Okay.
I ain't sure that's the right thing, but I know it...
This is probably about right for right in here.
Where did my little wheel go?
Here's one right here, Ken.
Thank you. Well...
Will a 250-millimeter lens get it?
John, I don't - I can't see through you, I don't know. But I would think that on the horizon you get most anything because...
Yeah, but that's a long ways out.
No, I'll do it.
Ten-year medals for free.
tracking that out.
Right?
This is the most unique crater I've ever seen; the one right here with the black rim. It's all white except for the rim. See that bright crater.
Yeah, yeah. That's - that big crater is Chaplygin and the...
Okay. That was the Sea of Moscow. Excuse me.
Okay.
Whatever that means.
Take any good pictures yet?
Yes.
handle it Soviets eat their heart out.
If they come, I bet they don't quit.
You - you...
You know, this Window 5 is a little foggy on the outer pane, too.
Yeah.
Just a little.
What frame number was that?
That frame number was number 4. Number 4.
Now, we're gonna be able to see earthrise right now.
You want to get a picture of earthrise?
Well, probably not. There's probably only been ten million pictures already took of it. But if you're looking for PR, like the Sea of Moscow or some other thing.
What'd you take it at, 1/250, f/11 - f/87 John?
I put it 1/250 at f/11. f/8 was probably a better choice.
Okay, Let me get it set.
Yeah, Pitch, 10, and Yaw, 355. We pick them up on Omni C, and then we'll shift over.
Yeah, we can do that.
Okay. And in a few minutes, we're gonna do our systems checks. Huh?
Yeah. Okay, we're gonna do our systems checks for DOI. Another one of these things we can get started early.
Dang it. window screwed up like that? It's really.
I can't believe it.
What's that, Charlie?
That that's the fu - (laughter) - tape recorder - that that's the Moon down there.
It's the whole thing.
The whole thing. I thought we'd see Tsiolkovsky this rev. Oh, yeah.
It comes again.
That right? Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I imagine when the Soviets start up here, they'll set up their lunar base in the first place; stay for a while.
Now that's really frustrating.
I can't understand what doing out over that way.
Man, there sure is a lot of things up here that I don't understand. Look at that big crater down south with the rocks in it. Or - you - you're looking right at it. It's got layers of walls there.
Which direction? That bright one there?
Yeah, the bright one. With the lay - it's got layers of walls in it. I don't know what the name of that one is. It looks like - you get a little higher Sun angle, it looks like anthracite coal laid in against chalk. It doesn't look that way right now.
It's really a unique crater chain down there. Really - south of track,
Okay, is that -
Yeah, that's right there.
Well, that's not - those crater chains there. Let's see, we just passed probably?
I just can't get it.
Try it again. You got King? Isn't that King back there?
Right out to the left.
I don't see it. It may be in your window.
Yeah.
Way out there.
Where?
Way out there, yeah.
Okay, I'm looking - right there.
Yeah. I can see it.
What do you think about King?
See, it's got kind of funny little things in it...
(Sneeze)
that - things that look like lava flows -
(Sneeze).
But they've got to be lava flows running down the side of that mountain there...
(Sneeze)
whatever made that crater.
It's pretty big.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's got to be lava flows.
Okay. These crater chains running down here should lead down to Tsiolkovsky.
Yeah.
They do! Aha! There it is!.
Okay, there's.
Oh, hey, that is pretty...
Isn't that something?...
Isn't that a beauty?
Yeah, dang.
That - that must be one of the more spectacular things that here.
Oh, you bet.
Well, I'd cancel the earthrise here.
Okay. Okay.
What a treat. And so many things, I can't get. I'm like a little kid with ice cream; I don't know where to start.
Right.
Oh, these windows are just really frosting.
Should be AOSing here pretty quick.
Yeah.
Shouldn't we, Charlie?
Not until we get earthrise.
what I mean. We were talking to them about King the last time we came across here.
We should get AOS at King. Now is that Thesaur?
No, that's not Pasteur. There's Pasteur. Pasteur's right here.
Ken, is it that little bright one right down there south of King?
That's what I was just wondering, but I think that Pasteur is supposed to be bigger than that.
could be the rays probably coming out of the King.
Yeah.
It looks like it goes in the same sort of a See those bright things on the bottom of it?
Yeah.
know what this and how all this happened.
Look at this - I never noticed this before. We got a crater chain. It goes from here, right straight to the horizon.
Yeah. Right along the track.
Yeah? I never noticed that.
Well, you ain't been here but a few hours.
(Laughter)
Right straight to the horizon?
Yeah. There's a - it starts down here.
South of Pasteur.
And these two - see these two craters?
Yeah.
It's almost right in the center of this window. Starts - And these two craters are together.
Yeah.
And then it cuts down here and it goes towards the horizon and stops at the mare.
Better get ready to.
(Cough)
While we were - while we were I guess the weight was 25 pounds, ten percent.
Man, it's frustrating when one of these things pops those things in and out. Wonder what it is that makes it do this; it doesn't do it when you look at it. It only does it when you hit the binoculars. One other picture.
Waste water dump still open?
No. Better not be now.
No, I don't think the waste water dump particles?
There it comes; there it comes, you guys!
Oh, looky at that.
Isn't that spectacular?
Man, instant earthrise!
Look at that guy creep up.
(Applause)
I don't care if we got 10,000...
Hello there, Houston.
we're going to have 10,001 of these (laughter)...
Hurry, quick!
Take it? Got to go to Reacq and you're at - High Gain...
No. No.
Houston, 16.
Beautiful.
Want me to get them on Omni first?
Yeah.
Houston, 16.
We had S-band Acquisition and S-band High Gain.
Hello, 16; Houston. How do you read?
Yeah. Wrong page.
Rog. Read you 5 by, Henry. We just got the 10,000th picture of a beautiful Earthrise.
Ain't there yet. Over here.
Outstanding.
This is really some place.
We had a chance to watch you get AOS that time. I know we got lots of pictures of it, but you're going to have to look at one more.
That is - man, that is...
Isn't that beautiful?
But you know, some of those photographs around the office that people say are - are no good, that looks the same color to me.
Yeah. I don't think that photo fidelity's true.
Man (laughter) -
how long before we get to.
About - ten minutes.
out the.
Yeah.
16, Houston. Were you trying to transmit? We heard a little noise on the loop there and looks like our data was dropping in and out; looks good now.
Negative. We weren't trying to say anything, Hank.
He probably didn't get our initial call.
Okay.
We just can't find any words. Everybody's peeking out the window here.
Rog.
We got all the dumps completed, and we're - all the dumps are secure.
Copy.
And I got some pictures on the back side of - Icarus and the - and the black of the Sea of Moscow.
And the material to the north of us at the terminator, we don't think we got for.
Okay, Houston, we have you on the High Gain. How do you read? Over.
Okay; reading you five by five.
Okay, Hank, I'm turning the Pan Camera to Mode, Standby - Power, On.
Roger.
Hank - I'm sure they have been described before, but the most - to me, the most unique craters up here - are two that we're just going over now - that - her ejecta blanket is completely white with white interior, but with a black rim to them.
Right down in there.
You know, that SPS comes on a lot...
Right there?
than I thought.
Descartes.
I thought it would be a big bang, but it's a slow buildup.
It won't be - the next one will be pretty slow, but the one you feel after that will be a surprise.
I bet. PDI. We get a plane change on board, too, don't we?
Yeah.
Holy smoke. Oh. Here's an eat period. Filled with little things to do. Shh. Gosh.
Houston, 16.
Go ahead.
Hey, Hank, how do the SPS data look?
Okay, we were just talking about that, Charlie. Apparently, we had a real nominal burn. Our data down here showed a burn time of six minutes, 14.2 seconds, which is right on the money. And I got a few words on that PC drop. I understand that's completely normal for the first dual-bank burn, due to some helium bubbles that are normally trapped between the ball valves. So that wasn't unexpected for the first dual-bank burn - you shouldn't see it again. And as far as the SPS pressure light that came on, we warned you earlier to expect that, due to the pressure surge of the tanks pressurizing, we - you were right on the 200-psi limit - that triggered it. The second pressure light you got, which is apparently still on, is due to heat soak back into the tank. So it's not unexpected either.
Okay, fine. We passed that word on to you about the light. Not that we weren't expecting it, but just to tell you what had happened.
Okay.
16, Track Mode Auto on High Gain.
Okay.
You got it.
Houston, 16. Over.
Go ahead.
That crater Icarus we got the profile picture of, it's a big round crater and it has real steep walls, and the central peak is a - is a - the central peak is a little above the - the crater walls, and you'll see that profile when you get the picture back. But the shape of the central peak is such that the only Earth analog I've ever seen that looked like it was sort of a shield volcano. I never saw anything like that in the - Now, I'm not saying the whole thing is not an impact, but that central peak is really unusual.
Roger. We copy, and we're also through with the Pan Camera - you can go Power Off on that.
Houston, apparently this line of secondaries down here that cross the mare - gives you the impression that there have been a couple of great big chickens been walking across there.
Roger.
That - that was courtesy of Charlie Duke, our airborne geologist and chicken farmer.
Roger. Maybe you better watch your step.
I'm watching.
Hank, you can tell Farouk that - those smooth areas we thought we saw around Isidorus and Capella are indeed uniquely different in texture. They are quite smooth. We'll get a chance to play with them later.
Hey, that sounds real interesting, Ken.
How are your systems checks coming?
Rog; Hank. We've already finished those.
Okay.
Henry, the amount of terminator movement in one rev is kind of dramatic up here. Last time around, Descartes just barely showed as a crater - but showed very dramatically - and now it's - as it moves out, it's starting to lose some of the starkness, and I'll get a picture of this bright zone. And it sure looks right now like the material that is just to the north of the crater Descartes and that stuff we talked about going between Delambre B and Descartes A are in fact extensions of the things that go into the Smoky and Stone Mountains. They - right now - look like they have a very similar texture.
Roger; we copy.
Hank, it sure looks like we can see Gator and Palmetto from here. It's almost straight down.
Does it look like the map?
Well, that stuff around the outside sure doesn't look like it did at high Sun.
Apollo 16, Houston. If you'll give us Accept, we'll uplink state vector and target load.
You have it.
Apollo 16, Houston. I have your DOI PAD, your map update, and landmark PAD, whenever you're ready.
Okay, go wed - ahead with the DOI PAD.
Roger. DOI, SPS/G&N; 41441; plus 1.87, minus 0.71; 078:33:44.39; Noun 81: minus 0205.3, all zips, minus 0045.5; 000, 274, 000; 0058.5, plus 0010.3; 0210.3, 0:24.2, 0203.8; sextant star: 22, 204.8, 21.7. The rest of the PAD's NA. Set stars Sirius and Rigel; 131; 071; 014. Four jets 15 seconds. End of PAD.
Okay, copy. DON - DOI, SPS/G&N; 41441; plus 1.87, minus 0.71; 078:33:44.39; minus 02053, plus all balls, minus 0045.5; 000, 274, 000; 0058.5, plus 0010.3; 0210.3, 0:24.2, 0203.8; 22, 204.8, 21.7. Rest of the PAD is NA. Sirius and Rigel; 131; 071; 014. Four jets, 15 seconds.
Good readback, Charlie.
I have your map update Rev 3 whenever you're ready, Charlie. It's 79:05 in the Flight Plan.
All right, why don't you give me the map update and the Landmark PAD?
All righty. Map update: LOS: 78:23:17; 78:48:09; 79:10:25. Landmark PAD is T-horizon: 79:34:11; 79:36:22.
Roger; copy. Map update of 078:23:17; 078:48:09; 079:10:25. Landmark tracking is 79:34:11; 79:36:22.
Good readback.
16, the computer's yours, and I have your TEI-5 PAD for the updates book.
Okay, Hank, before we do that - Looking at the change to the Flight Plan here, we got to load the Verb 48 to put in the proper DAP, and then start 509, and then go to the P52. Can we go ahead and stop the maneuver now and will this attitude clear enough things so we can get a P52 in here?
Stand by.
I'm sorry; I didn't copy that.
Roger. Stand by a minute, Ken, I'll have FAO check.
Thank you. I was worried about getting in the same problem we get into after undocking tomorrow, where it might take a special angle.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 16, Houston. FAO says this is a good attitude.
16, Houston. Are you ready for the TEI-5 PAD yet?
Rog; go ahead.
Okay, PAD follows: TEI-5, SPS/G&N; 39838; plus 0.61, plus 1.19; 084:31:41:36; Noun 81: plus 3525.2, plus 1247.3, minus 0086.8; 182, 056, 022; the rest is NA. Set stars: Sirius, Rigel; 131; 071; 014. Two jets, 17 seconds. Other: 1, burn undocked; 2, assumes DOI; 3, landing site REFSMMAT.

Good readback, Charlie.
Houston, do you want to take a look at our rotated vector in P40 before we start our maneuver?
Roger. Stand by.
Your P30 looked good, Ken.
Okay. The question was, do you want to take a look at the rotated vector in P40 before we start our maneuver, or can we go ahead and start the maneuver?
Houston, did you miss the question?
Negative, but we're having trouble finding an answer.
Okay.
16, Houston. Go ahead and call P40, then maneuver.
Okay. Have you got enough look now?
He's looking at it now, Ken.
You got a good vector, Ken. Go ahead.
16, give us Omni Delta.
Okay, you got it?
Roger.
Apollo 16, Houston. Everything looks good down here. You've got a Go for DOI, and the monitoring limits in the Flight Plan are good.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. The gimbal motors are on.
Roger, John.
Okay, Houston. We're going to do the gimbal drive check.
Roger. We're watching.
Okay; the gimbals are trimmed.
Roger; copy.
And 509 is killed.
Roger.
16, Houston. We're about two minutes from LOS.
Roger. Two minutes from LOS.
About 12 - 12 from the burn.
Roger.
