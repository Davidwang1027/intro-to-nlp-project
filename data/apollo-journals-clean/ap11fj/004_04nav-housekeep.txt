Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Be advised your friendly White Team has come on for its first shift. If we can be of service, don't hesitate to call.
Thank you very much. And we're about to take our marks, Charlie, on this P23 optics Cal. I've got it in the sextant now, and I'm about to split the image and Mark.
Roger, Mike. We're watching.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have scrubbed the Midcourse 1. Over.
Roger. Understand you've scrubbed Midcourse 1.
Rog.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We see your middle gimbal angle getting pretty big. Over.
Well, it was, Charlie, but in going from one Auto Maneuver to another, we took over control and have gone around gimbal lock; and we're about to give control back to the DAP.
Roger, Mike. We see it increasing now.
Hey, Charlie.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
Hey, maybe you better call Lew and tell him we might be a little bit late for dinner.
Okay. Sure will. We'd like for you to turn on - the fan on in O2 tank number 2, Buzz. And, 11, did you - On your optics calibrations, did you proceed or recall the program? Over.
We recalled the program.
Roger.
And O2 fan number 2 is on.
Rog.
Houston, Apollo 11. got a Cryo pressure light and a Master Alarm. It's reset.
Ah, Roger. We expected that. That's why we had you turn the fan on. We were getting pretty close to the caution and warning limits. We were trying to prevent that.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
Roger. You looking at our Delta-R/Delta-V? It looks like Delta-R is pretty large, there. We wanted to talk to you about it before we incorporate it.
Stand by, Mike. We don't have anything on our downlink here, I don't think, on the DSKY. Stand by.
Okay. Our Noun 49 is reading: register 1, plus 08793; register 2, all balls.
Copy.
11, Houston. Guidance is looking at the Noun 40 - 49 stuff. We'll be back with you momentarily. Over.
Okay, Charlie. Thank you. We'll just hold right here in the program.
Roger. We got your downlink now. Over.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to reject the Noun 49 stuff on the DSKY right now, Mike, and try it again. Over.
Okay. Will do.
Okay, Houston. Apollo 11. Here's another 49 for you. Are you getting it on the downlink?
Roger. We see it. Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We recommend you accept the Noun 49 display on the DSKY now. Over.
Okay. It looks like an awful big one. We noticed that you'd moved star number 2 to the tail end of the listing, and we should be marking first on star 40. Did that have anything to do with it?
Negative. We don't believe so, Apollo 11. We think that this is possibly due to some TLI dispersions, and it's probably satisfactory, so go ahead and accept this. It fits our criteria anyway that if you repeat the mark and you get an equivalent size error, to go ahead and accept it. And this is an equivalent size error. Over.
Okay. We'll do it.
And 11, Houston. Your state vector in the LM slots are - is good. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 11. If you like this one, we'll accept it as well.
Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We recommend you accept the Noun 49. Over.
Okay, Charlie. Thank you. We'll do that now.
Thank you.
And we're going to proceed on this one, too, Charlie.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, Apollo 11. Another Noun 49 for you.
Rog. We copy. Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to recycle and do this one over again. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, Apollo 11. Over.
Rog. Why don't you sing out when you think we've done enough battery charging on B.
Rog. Stand by, Buzz. Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'll be charging battery B up until the sleep period. We'll discontinue charging at that time. Also, at about 12:25 in the Flight Plan, we have battery A charge. That has been deleted. Over.
Rog. Understand. We'll charge until the sleep period on B and delete the battery A charge.
Affirm.
And, Houston, Apollo 11. These Auto optics maneuvers or P23s, Auto maneuvers, don't seem to be going to the substellar point. Can you come up with the roll, pitch, and yaw angle for the substellar point on this star? It's our second star.
Roger. Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Your angles in the Flight Plan we feel are still good; 198.6, 130.7, 340.0. Just slightly off than those in the Flight Plan. Over.
Okay. We'll try that.
Charlie, state those three angles one more time. I'd like to confirm them before I maneuver.
Roger. Roll and pitch are slightly off than what's in the Flight Plan, 11. Roll is now 198.6, pitch is 130.7. Over.
Roger. Roll 198.6, pitch 130.7, and yaw 34000.
That's affirmative.
Houston, Apollo 11. I think the problem here is that that attitude just is not too close to the substellar point. I'm having to maneuver quite a bit; and that's in progress now, so stand by for some marks.
Roger. We copy it all.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've run the angles given in the Flight Plan for the P23 attitude through the machines down here, and they come up the same thing every time. We think everything's going correctly, Mike, and we're wondering if the non-symmetrical horizon might by giving a problem. Over.
Yeah, it could be, Charlie. Stand by here. We'll get another mark for you.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. Noun 49 for you.
Roger. Copy.
Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We recommend you accept the Noun 49. Continue through your sequence of sightings, and then we'll analyze the data afterwards. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. Star 40 has just disappeared now in the sextant. Could the trunnion angle 47 - something be a little high?
Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to press on to star 44. Over.
Yeah, Roger. How many marks have you recorded on star 40?
Stand by, Mike.
Okay.
11, Houston. We copied two good marks. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead. Over.
Roger. Forty-four is just not bright enough for this. There is a reddish glow filling the black area of the sextant, and the star is lost somewhere in there, and I cannot see it.
Roger. Stand by. We'll come up with another star. Over.
Yeah. I'd appreciate that.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to go on to star 45. Over.
Okay.
And, Mike, we think these large Delta-Rs, Noun 49, you're getting is really meaningful since it's been way before TLI since we had a state vector update; and we think it's normal. Over.
Okay. Could be, Charlie. Some of the early markings: I might not have had precisely the substellar point. I think as time goes by they've been coming more accurate but old Enif here is just flat invisible.
Rog.
And, Houston, Apollo 11. Understand that the same three gimbal angles you gave me should be valid for star 45 as well. Is that affirmative?
I believe that's right. Stand by one. Over.
Okay.
That is negative. Stand by one.
Okay. Because there's quite a difference between the gimbal angles you have and the gimbal angles the program wants, but with inaccurate state vector, I'm inclined not to believe the program.
Stand by.
Houston, Apollo 11. LMP is back on the line.
Roger. Copy.
Read you five-by.
Roger. The same, Buzz. And, 11, the angles for you are 197.8 for roll, 128.5 pitch, 340.0 yaw.
Okay. Just as a matter of comparison, P23 for this star would like to go to 235.66, 154.31, and 31365. Over.
Roger. We copy, 11. We understand that the program can give you almost an infinite combination of angles in P23, and it's not too unreasonable. If you'll stand by, we'll look at these that we see on the DSKY. Over.
Okay. Then in the meantime I'll just go ahead and maneuver to yours. 197.8, 128.5, and 340.0.
Rog.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead. Over.
Okay, Charlie. If the attitude you gave me on star number 45 - The reticle is off, I'd say, a good 30 degrees in roll, and the star is not in sight. Over.
Roger. Stand by.
I think something's wrong with those attitudes.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. I wondered if you have Auto Optics selected. Over.
That's affirmative.
Roger. Looks like to us we need a Proceed, Mike, to get the sextant pointed at the star. Over.
Okay. Stand by.
11, Houston. Those shaft and trunnion angles were exactly what we were computing on the ground. Over.
Okay. I'm going to trim up the attitude here and give it another try.
Okay. I have this star loud and clear now, Charlie, so I might as well do a bunch of marks on this one to get a good horizon count.
Roger. Stand by.
It still looks like I'm far from the substellar point, however. I'm off quite a bit in roll.
Roger. We'd like you to mark right where it is now, Mike, and we'd like two sets of marks on this. Over.
Okay. Fine. But the reticle is not parallel to the horizon. I have to move off quite a bit in order to get it parallel to the horizon.
Apollo 11, Houston. Our procedures guys are saying that the reticle does not have to be parallel. Over.
Well, then we're not at the substellar point, if we're not.
Rog.
Houston, you copy that Noun 49?
Roger. We see it, 11. Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to accept this one and every mark thereafter. Over.
Okay.
You need me to wait in the Noun 49 display for any length of time?
Negative.
Okay.
Okay, Charlie. I'd be glad to give you as many of these as you like.
Roger. We'd like six marks on star 45, Mike, and then we'll probably go back to star 2 again. Stand by. We'll have further word on that.
Okay.
They seem to be getting smaller, Charlie? Are you sure you wouldn't like some more?
Stand by, Mike.
It's no trouble.
Rog. Stand by. Out.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to do two more on star 45. Over.
Okay.
Okay, Charlie. There's your two more marks. Where do you want to go from here?
Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to go back to star number 2 with an attitude as follows: roll, 195.2; pitch, 123.9; yaw, 340.0. Mike, that'll give you a trunnion angle of about 31.4. Over.
Okay. Understand star number 2 and roll, 195.2; pitch, 123.9; and yaw, 340.0. Over.
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Okay, Charlie. I'm there, and I've got a trunnion angle of 30.5 degrees. Again, misaligned considerably in roll and I do believe that's important to getting good marks.
Stand by.
See, if I'm - my reticle's not parallel, then I'm not marking normal to the horizon and I'm not marking at the substellar point. I'm marking off somewhere else.
Stand by one. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. The ground-computed values for your shaft and trunnion are just what you're getting on the DSKY there, Mike. The horizon looks cocked off to you - You look like you're off in roll because the angles that we gave you to maneuver to, to prevent the LM reflection from fouling up your optics, we feel like a - you should go ahead and mark on the star just as is. Over.
Okay.
I'll bet you a cup of coffee on it.
Ah, copy.
Verb - or a Noun 49 for you, Charlie.
Ah, Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like to accept this one and give us two more and that will be enough. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. We see your termination on P23. Thank you very much. Mike, we'll have a - We're trying to work up a story here for you; we'll be with you momentarily on an explanation of what's happening. Over.
Okay, Charlie. It just appears to me that you have to have the reticle tangent to the horizon at the point at which you mark or else you're not at the substellar point; you're off laterally, and therefore you're measuring a larger trunnion angle than you should.
Seems so to me. Our procedures people are working on this, and we'll be back with you momentarily. Over.
Thanks, sir.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to go P00 and Accept. We'll have a PTC REFSMMAT for you momentarily. Over.
Roger. Going P00 and Accept.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're through with the load. You can go back to Block.
In Block. Thank you.
Hello Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to do a P52, option 1 preferred, and establish PTC as listed in the Flight Plan at 12 hours. We'd like you to commence that right now, Mike. And we have some stars recommended for you. For stars 26, 30, and 24, when you get to attitude 000. Over.
Okay, Charlie. He's off the wick right now. Understand you're ready for us to do a P52, option 1?
11, it's a P52, option 1 preferred. Over.
Roger. And, let's see, that is Spica, Menkent, and what else?
Roger. Stars - Codes are stars 26, 30, and 24. Over.
24. Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We notice your Program Alarm, Mike, was due to using these stars in the P23 attitude. If you'll go to 000, the stars we gave you will work. Over.
Okay. Understand.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Prior to you starting your P52, we'd like to give you a new CSM state vector. Over.
Roger.
Wait till we finish the maneuver and we'll give you the DSKY.
Roger. We're standing by.
Houston, Apollo 11. The DSKY is yours.
Apollo 11, Houston. Go ahead. Over.
Roger. The DSKY is yours.
Roger Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can do the Verb 66. The computer is yours, and then the P52, option 1, preferred. Over.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Do you read? Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. If you read, this attitude 000 is pretty bad for our Comm. In fact, we've lost all data with you, and unreadable on the voice. We recommend you do the P52, option 1 preferred...
not a very good attitude at all for Comm, and as soon as we finish our alignment, we'll maneuver it to a different attitude. Over.
Roger, 11. We copy. Recommend you go to this P52, option 1 preferred, and then go to PTC attitude. Over. Then we'll get some Comm. When you get there to PTC attitude, it'll be pitch 90, yaw 0 on the high gain. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Roger, 11. You're about one-by. Go ahead.
Apollo 11, Houston. You're about one-by. Go ahead. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Roger, 11. Read you about four-by. How me? Over.
You're loud and clear, Charlie. We pitched down some to get a better comm attitude.
Roger. Did you copy our recommendation on proceeding with the P52, Mike? Over.
Negative. We didn't. I've got that in work. I'm starting on P52.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
Roger. You copy our torquing angles? We're about to torque them.
Roger. Stand by.
Rog. The reason for the delay there, Charlie, is that - difficult to find two stars that are not occulted by the LM and also are not in the midst of a man-made star field up here, with dumps.
Roger. We copy.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can torque the Noun 93. Over.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. That completes the P52. We verified the third star with Antares, and Auto optics are pointing at it pretty closely. How do our platform drift angles look so far, Charlie?
Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We didn't have a chance to get a good check for you. We're going to run a drift check from this alignment until the next one, approximately 12 hours, and we'll have something for you later. Over.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to establish your PTC. We recommend you select quads Alpha and Delta. Over.
Roger. Understand. Alpha and Delta quads for PTC.
That's affirmative.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Would you verify that the Attitude Set switch is in GDC? Over.
The Set switch. Stand by one, Charlie.
Roger.
It is now.
Roger. It was on IMU?
That's affirmative.
Rog. Thank you.
Hi, Houston, Apollo 11. How many miles out do you have us now?
We have you - Stand by, Buzz. Roughly about 50,000. Stand by.
It's a beautiful sight.
Charlie, on the PTC, we're just waiting our 20 minutes here for all thruster activity to damp out. You might let us know how that's coming.
Roger. Will do. We have you about 48,000 miles now?
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 11. We still have our oxygen fan on for Tank 2. Is that what you want?
Stand by.
Hey, Charlie, I can see the snow on the - on the mountains out in California, and it looks like LA doesn't have much of a smog problem today.
Roger, Buzz. Copy. Looks like there's a good view out there then.
And, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to keep the O2 fan on. It will give you an ECS configuration prior to sleep. Over.
Okay. Fine.
Charlie, with the monocular, I can discern a definite green cast to the San Fernando Valley.
Roger.
How's Baja California look, Buzz?
Well, it's got some clouds up and down it, and there's a pretty good circulation system a couple of hundred miles off the west coast of California.
Roger. 11, we'd like you to close the waste storage vent valve right now.
Okay.
Waste storage vent valves closed.
Copy.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like - The rates are looking pretty good right now on the PTC, but we'd like you to continue holding. Over.
Okay. Fine.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Your rates look really great, now. You can start your PTC.
Okay. Thanks, Charlie.
Houston, you read 11?
Roger. Go ahead, 11. Over.
Roger. If you'd like to delay PTC after - for 10 minutes or so, we can shoot you some TV of a seven-eighths Earth. That's - We'll leave that up to you.
Roger. Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'll have our answer for you on the TV in about one minute. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. We're ready at Goldstone for the TV. It'll be recorded at Goldstone and then replayed back over here, Neil. Any time you want to turn her on, we're ready. Over.
Okay. It'll take us about 5 minutes to get rigged.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Could you verify the reading on your O2 flow indicator? Over.
We're showing 0.2. We just inadvertently touched the Rapid Repress button. That made a temporary glitch in the flow.
Roger. During that glitch there, did it go almost a peg high? Over.
I'd believe that.
Apollo 11, Houston. Could you tell us - tell us if the O2 flow indicator was pegged to high prior to closing the waste storage vent valve? Over.
No, it was not.
Roger. Thank you.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. A while ago we tracked into the scan limits and disabled the Auto drive on the High Gain. We'd like you to position the antenna at pitch 30, yaw 270, go to Reacq; that will give us a narrow beamwidth. Over.
That yaw 270 and pitch 3 - What was the pitch?
Pitch 30, Neil.
Okay. I think we've got you.
Roger. We've got a good signal there. Thank you much.
Okay, Houston. We are sending a picture of Earth down right now, so you can let us know if they're receiving at Goldstone.
Roger, 11. Goldstone is receiving the TV. Stand by. We'll let you know on the quality. Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Goldstone says that the TV looks great. Over.
Roger. We're zooming in on Earth now.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Did you copy? Over.
Roger. We copied, Charlie.
Roger. Your transmissions the last couple of times have been about two-by. Over.
Okay. How do you read me now?
Rog. You're five-by now.
Okay. We're zooming the lens on in, until it will just about fill the monitor.
Roger.
Okay. It's in full zoom, now.
Copy, 11.
And how about the f-stop? Is 22 going to be adequate?
Stand by. We'll get with the Goldstone TV guy. We don't have anything here at Houston. Stand by.
It looks good on the monitor, as far as the f-stop goes. Therefore, we just assumed it's okay at Goldstone.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Goldstone says it - TV looks really great, five-by; we don't - The AGC looks like it's working fine. The f:22 is good; we have no real white spots. They're real pleased with it. Over.
Okay. You just cut out, Charlie. We understand that it's looking great. We'll leave it the way it is and wait for you to come back on.
Roger. How do you read me now? Over.
Five-by.
Okay. My comments were - My comments were from Goldstone that they see no white spots as we saw in 10. Looks like the AGC's working real well. The f:22 looks good. Over.
Okay. Very good. Well, we shut out the Sun coming in from the other windows into the spacecraft, so it's looking through a - the Number 1 window on Earth, and any reflected light so, it ought to be a pretty good picture.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to keep the TV on for about 10 minutes or so, so we can get come good comparison on the camera. You can do anything your heart desires on the TV: interior, exterior, pan in and out, anything you'd like. Over.
11, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Roger. Go ahead. Over.
Charlie, I'm sorry; you keep cutting out. We heard up to you can do anything, and then after that we didn't hear anything, and we knew that wasn't right anyhow because we can't. But what do you want us to do?
Roger. We'll check this uplink on our voice. That transmission on the TV was - We'd like to get about 10 minutes worth of signal at Goldstone so we can look at the camera quality back here at Houston for about 10 minutes or so when they patch it back into us. What we were saying was that you can go interior or exterior on the camera. On the exterior shots, we'd like to look...
You cut out again.
Stand by.
Start over with: We were saying.
Okay, Houston. You suppose you could turn the Earth a little bit so we could get a little bit more than just water?
Roger, 11. I don't think we got much control over that. Looks like you'll have to settle for the water.
11, Houston. We're going to change - thinking about changing our voice uplink to another site. If you'll stand by, we'll see if we can improve the quality. Over.
Okay, Charlie.
We'll stand by for your call.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'll try once more on this TV request. We'd like 10 minutes worth of TV. And we'd like a narrative, if you could give us one, on the exterior shots. You could al - we also suggest you might try the - an interior position. Over.
Roger. We're seeing the center of the Earth as viewed from the spacecraft in the eastern Pacific Ocean. We have not been able to visually pick up the Hawaiian Island chain, but we can clearly see the western coast of North America, the United States, the San Joaquin Valley, the High Sierras, Baja California, and Mexico down as far as Acapulco, and the Yucatan Peninsula; and you can see on through Central America to the northern coast of South America, Venezuela, and Colombia. I'm not sure you'll be able to see all that on your screens down there.
Roger, Neil. We just wanted a narrative such that we can - When we get the playback, we can sort of correlate what we're seeing. Thank you very much.
I haven't seen anything but the DSKY so far.
Looks like they're hogging the windows.
You're right.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. On your cryos, we'd like, at this time, for you to place all four cryo heaters to Auto and turn off all four cryo fans. Over.
Okay. All four cryo heaters are Auto. And all four cryo fans are off, all off.
Roger. That's going to be your sleep configuration.
Okay.
And, Buzz, we'll be terminating the battery charge in about a half hour.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can terminate the TV at your convenience. We've got enough tape, and you can start PTC at your convenience. The rates look super for starting up. Over.
Roger, Charlie.
Apollo 11, Houston. We have a Flight Plan update for you and some P37 block data, if you're ready to copy. Over.
Stand by.
Okay, Houston. PTC is started now; looks good to us, and we'll be ready to copy in a minute or two.
Roger. Copy, 11.
Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy the Flight Plan update and P37.
Roger. Stand by one, Buzz.
Apollo 11, Houston. Coming at you with the P37 block data. Over.
Okay.
Roger. 027:44, 5363, minus 165, 073:14; 037:44, 8016, minus 165, 072:46; GETI 046:44, 6141, minus 165, 097:03; 055:44, 8209, minus 165, 096:42. Ready for your readback. Over.
Roger. 027:44, 5363, minus 165, 073:14, 037:44, 8016, minus 165, 072:46; 046:44, 6141, minus 165, 097:03, 055:44, 8209, minus 165, 096:42. Over.
Roger, 11. That was a good readback. That was the block data scheduled for 12 hours. We'd like to just say that on a Flight Plan update here, just to remind you of some things, and that you can do them at your convenience and then go to sleep early if you'd like. We don't have anything else planned, but we'd like to just remind you on the filter change, the O2 fuel cell purge. And we'd like a LM/CM Delta-P and accomplish the pre-sleep checklist.
Okay. We've completed the filter change, and we'll get started on the fuel cell purge, and stand by for the LM/CM Delta-P.
Roger, 11. Would you hold off on the fuel cell purge? EECOM's saying we might not have to do that. Over.
Okay.
Charlie, the LM/CM Delta-P is 0.5.
Copy. 0.5. Out.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We just decided to delete the O2 fuel cell purge. Over.
Roger. Delete the O2 fuel cell purge.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've been noting some funnies on the O2 flow indicator transducer. We've kind of got a suspicion it's the transducer. We - weexpected to see an O2 flow pegged high with the waste stowage vent to Vent. It was not. We also noted some funny indications when you closed the waste stowage vent valve. We're going to continue to look at this through the night, and we'll be with you in the morning with an assessment of the problem. Also, we'd like to ask specifically, when you place the waste stowage vent valve to Vent, does the detent - correction - does the arrow line up with the detent? Over.
Stand by one, Charlie. We'll give you something on the detent.
Roger.
Right now it's at Closed, and I'm lined up with Closed. Before I was at Vent; and best I can recall, it was quite accurately lined up with Vent. Would you like me to go to Vent again momentarily and see where it lines up?
That's negative. That question's answered. Thank you much.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have an S-band configuration for you. Over.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger, Buzz. We'd like you to place the S-band antenna Omni A switch to the Bravo position. S-band antenna Omni switch to the Omni position, the High Gain track to Manual, and the High Gain angles will be yaw 270, pitch minus 50. Over.
Roger. Understand. Omni to Baker and Omni, Manual. And the angles are yaw 270, pitch minus 50, and was that narrow or wide? Over.
Stand by. Roger. We'd like it in Wide, and you can set that configuration up now. Over.
It's in work.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can terminate the battery Bravo charge, and we'd like a crew status report. We're about to tell you good night. Over.
Roger. Stand by.
Houston, Apollo 11. The battery charging is complete, and the crew status report is as follows: radiation; CDR, 11002; CMP, 10002; LMP, 09003; negative medication; fit as a fiddle, over.
Rog. Copy, 11. Thank you much. We'd like to ask one question. Have you tried the gas separator on the water? How is that working? Over.
Yes. Mike's got a couple of comments on that.
Yeah, it's working good so far, Charlie. We've got one installed on the water gun and the other one installed on the spigot down in the LEB, and we mention one problem with them is that they leak at the junction between the food bag and the water filter. However, with that exception, they seem to be working pretty good. We were getting some gas through initially, and I think that was just getting the system purged out to begin with; and the last tubeful we poured was almost free of bubbles. Over.
Roger. Sounds good. We'll check in on that problem with the SPAN guys and let you know in the morning. If you have to call us tonight, we'd like you to do it on Down Voice Backup. We're configuring the MSFN for that mode; and as far as we can see, you're cleared for some z's. Over.
Okay. Maybe we'll get around to lunch.
How about a peanut butter and jelly?
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. I hope you aren't, - we aren't disturbing you. We'd like to terminate the Noun 65 now. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11...
Roger, Buzz. When you stopped - or, correction - when you terminated the Noun 65, it appears to us, you get a Verb 46 which collapsed the deadband back to 0.5. We're okay as long as you do not turn on any Auto RCS Select switches. Over.
Okay. I thought that was a - better way to clear the DSKY but evidently it isn't. Thank you.
Roger. Verb 34 would have been a better procedure.
Yeah. Thank you.
