Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead Houston, Apollo 11.
11, this is Houston. You are Go for LOI. Over.
Roger. Go for LOI.
And we're showing about 10 minutes and 30 seconds to LOS. I would like to remind you to enable the B/D roll on the Auto RCS switches. Over.
Roger. And confirm you want PCM Low going over the hill. Over.
That's affirmative, 11.
Roger.
If you want to, I'll put it back to high 'til just before LOS. Over.
Negative, 11. Low is okay for now. Over.
Roger.
Houston, do you want to give me a time check, please?
Roger. I'll give you a Mark at 13 minutes and 30 seconds to ignition.
Okay. And then a GET, please.
Stand by a minute.
I'll give you a time hack on the GET at 75 hours, 37 minutes and I'll try to bias it about a second and a half to allow for the time of flight.
Okay.
Stand by.
Mark.
75 hours, 37 minutes GET.
Thank you.
And I'll give you a time hack on time to ignition at 12 minutes to ignition. Over.
Okay.
Stand by for a Mark at TIG minus 12.
Mark.
TIG minus 12.
You were right on, Bruce. Thank you.
Roger. Out.
Two minutes to LOS.
Optics are up?
Yes.
Okay, 41:23. One minute to LOS. Mark that.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. All your systems are looking good going around the corner. We'll see you on the other side. Over.
Roger.
How much time have we got, Mike?
Everything looks okay up here.
Roger. Out.
9 minutes.
Well, let's let them look at the main bus ties coming on, alright?
Sure.
What time is it?
8½ minutes.
How soon are we going to...
take 2.
1 second early. Okay. Main Bus Ties...
Okay.
I'm going to turn my S-Band Volume down, so you can.
Down Voice Backup.
Main Bus Tie A coming On. Have you got TVC Gimbal Drive - Pitch and Yaw to Auto, huh?
TVC Gimbal Drive, Pitch and Yaw to Auto.
Okay, TVC...
He's not going to have the Sun in your eyes - I mean, on this thing, why don't we?
Is that right?
Now, you may have the Sun in your eyes coming around the corner. Now, you've got your patch ready in case you want it?
Got it right here.
Okay, TVC Servo Power 1, to AC 1,
TVC Servo Power 1, to AC 1.
2 to AC 2.
Look the other way.
2 to AC 2.
Translational Control Power, On.
Translational Control Power is On.
Rotation Control Power, Normal, number 2, to AC.
Okay, stand by. Rotational Control Power is Normal, number 2, to AC.
Rotation Hand Controller, number 2, Armed.
Rotational Hand Controller, number 2, is Armed.
It's going to have to get up pretty high to. Alright, time check.
Okay, we've got 6½.
Mark it...
6½.
10-minutes difference whether we, huh? That's a lot of time.
Yes.
Now, what do we do? Turn up - Where did the noise come from?
VHF or the S-band?
I don't know.
VHF, I think. It's a woo-woo noise.
Woo-oo, what time is it?
I turned my S-Band Volume down to get rid of that background noise. Now don't forget for us to turn it back up on the other side.
What time you got?
It's coming up on 5 minutes to TIG. I'll give you a mark.
Alright. Start giving me Pitch 1, Yaw 1.
Okay, here comes Pitch 1.
Got it.
Here comes Yaw 1.
Got it.
Mark...
5 minutes to TIG.
Alright. Translation Hand Controller's counter-clock - clockwise.
Hey, are you - are you on your Intercom switch? Intercom Push-To-Talk and all that?
Yes, yes.
Okay. Alright. Translational Controller's...
going TVC.
clockwise - that's verified. Alright, secondary TVC check; Gimbal Motors, Pitch 2, Yaw 2, On.
Pitch 2, Mark.
Got it.
Yaw 2, Mark.
Got it.
Okay.
Set GPI trim.
Plus...
Okay, it's set.
1.0, minus 0.2.
Yes, it's set. Verify MTVC.
Verified.
THC, Neutral.
Neutral.
Verify GPI return to zero, zero.
Verified.
Rot Control Power, Normal, number 2, to AC/DC.
AC/DC.
Spacecraft Control, CMC, verify.
CMC.
Okay. Now you got an option of trimming or bypassing.
Let's bypass.
Alright. BMAG Mode, three, to Att 1/Rate 2.
Okay, we're going to - Did you say after Enter?
Before Enter.
Okay, Att 1/Rate 2. BMAG's in shape.
Enter.
Enter.
Verify Spacecraft Control, CMC.
CMC.
Accept this with a Proceed.
Proceed. You ready to go?
Yes. Up, down, zero. Up, down, zero. Off and the Off.
Three minutes. Three...
Rotational Control Power, Direct, two of them, to Main A/Main B.
Rotational Control Power, Direct, Main A/Main B.
Okay. SPS Helium Valves, verified Auto, barber pole. Limit Cycle, Off.
Okay.
FDAI scale, 50/15.
Alright.
Stand by for 2 minutes; then we'll have Delta-V Thrust B, On, okay?
That's right. Guess we want to turn it on at 2 minutes - Want to wait a while?
You already asked them that and they said turn it on at 2 minutes.
I never saw any lights, so they never saw a signal, so everything looks good. Put it on 2 minutes and be ready to turn it off.
Okay. I'll be ready. Coming up on 2 minutes.
Mark...
Go on, nothing happened.
Translation Controller, Armed.
Okay.
Rotation Controller, Armed.
Okay.
Tape Recorder. Drifted off a little bit in pitch.
Tape recorder's running, right?
Tape recorder is running. You verify the EMS set up the way you want it?
Yes, I got to go to horizontal at 35.
35, 30 seconds, yes.
I'll proceed on the 99.
Alright. 60...
You're going to watch the - go gray...
Right.
and the ball valve.
Right.
35 seconds; DSKY's blank, EMS Mode, Normal. Okay.
Yes, the Moon is there, boy - in all its splendor.
Man, it's a...
Plaster of paris gray to me.
Man, look at it.
Don't look at it. Here we come up...
Okay.
to TIG.
8 seconds.
99...
Proceed.
Stand by for TIG.
Got B mode...
Burning. We're looking good.
A, here comes B - B, I mean, Thrust A...
Mark.
Got them.
Got them both? Okay, now what's your - read your chamber pressure?
It's good. 95, 95.
PUGS is oscillating around. Okay, we're steering.
95 seconds in, it says go Decrease, and we're.
You're in pretty good. Your gimbals are working a little bit more busily than I would have guessed, but everything's looking good.
EMS and G&N CALS together.
Okay.
Pitch trim is up at 1.5 degrees, cycling about that, which is a little bit off the SIM value. Yaw trim is cycling about zero. Chamber pressure...
{Garble].
is 95.
Right, going Increase.
Yes, you're into - a minute into it. Yes.
Well, it's still below zero, I just...
I'll bet you we're never going to catch up. Let's do it and see what happens.
Okay, that should be gray...
g feels sort of pleasant, doesn't it? We're measuring just a shadow over zero g on the g-meter.
Tank pressures are good.
Okay. The chamber pressure is holding steady as a rock. It's holding - it's building up a little bit, actually; it's up around 96 now. Gimbals are sure a little bit busier than I would have guessed.
That's a little more chamber pressure than they were predicting.
Yes, they're all plus 95.
We may...
Shut down a little early.
shut down a little early.
What do you think about this crazy g-scale?
All your look okay over there, Buzz?
Man, I'm not going to look at them.
Alright, probably a good rule.
How about that? It's running a couple up.
35 more seconds, and we'll be out of mode 2.
Well, it's more than just...
Chamber pressure continuing. It's up to about 97 - 98 percent.
more than just gray.
Yes, there's a little pinging in there. That might have jammed. Keep your arms off the cockpit, all day to look at that thing.
Look at that thing; that's just where I want it. What do you think about that? A tad low. We're not going to - match it - creep up. Okay? Pressure is on Increase...
Tank pressures are still good.
at the beginning.
Chamber pressure...
Take a look at this.
is holding. Wandering off a little bit in roll; that's to be expected. Coming back.
Okay...
We're well into mode 3.
it's going to be about 3 seconds early - cut-off.
Alright, cut-off nominal at 06:02; expect cut-off around 6 minutes even then, huh?
Okay, the rates. We're all three axes are about 0.1 degree per second. APS is punting back and forth.
I'm predicting 05:58.
Okay.
4 seconds early.
Right now.
May be - might be 5 by the time I get my.
Okay, she's steering like a champ; chamber pressure sneaking up to 100.
Look at the.
didn't recognize it..
Pitch trim is holding a little over 2; it's oscillating between 2 and 2.4, roughly. Yaw trim is oscillating between minus 0.5 and zero. It's just sort of aimlessly wandering back and forth between those values. Rates are still wandering; they're deadbanding the rates in all three axes; they're plus or minus 0.1 a degree.
We're now predicting 5 seconds early, 05:57.
Chamber pressure is 100 psi even.
Ball number 1 and ball number 2 both right on value. Roll zero, pitch 225, roughly, and yaw 348. And hold.
Okay, going to get the Delta-V switches Off right at shutdown?
Shutdown, I'll get both Delta-V Thrust, Normal switches, Off.
10 seconds.
Okay. 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3...
Shutdown.
Okay, now.
Ball valves closed...
50 seconds.
barber poles...
Okay.
All four. Standing by for the gimbal motors.
Alright. Pitch 1 - Off.
Got it.
Yaw 1, Off.
Got it.
Pitch 2, Off.
Got it.
Yaw 2, Off.
Got it.
Okay. TVC Servo Power 1 and 2, Off.
1, Off. 2, Off.
Main Bus Tie is Off.
Okay.
1, Off. 2, Off.
Man, man!
Alright.
Understand.
Look at the residuals. Proceed.
Proceed? Copy them down; we're not going to trim them.
minus 1, minus 1, plus 1. Jesus!
Got them.
I take back any bad things I ever said about MIT - which I never have.
Okay, will you just leave them, now? They vary around.
Alright, get the EMS, too.
Okay, EMS says minus 6.8.
Got it. You got them on the switches?
Minus 6.8 to the Delta-V to B.
Flight Plan.
Alright, no nulling residuals. EMS Function to Off, we got that?
1 minute - Neil's got it. We got it, minus 6.8. Okay, stand by on Off on EMS. What else you got, Buzz, in the way of a checklist?
The EMS Mode, Standby.
Standby.
BMAG Mode, three, to Rate 2.
Three to Rate 2.
ATT Deadband, Max?
ATT Deadband, Max.
PCM Bit Rate, Low.
Rotation Control Power, Direct, two of them, Off?
Direct, two, is Off.
Circuit breakers - Pitch 1, Pitch 2, Yaw 1, Yaw 2, Open.
Pitch 1, Pitch 2, Yaw 1, Yaw 2, Open. Proceed.
Okay, proceed. Okay, Verb 82 in there. Go to P00. Well, that isn't what it says, but...
Well, it's good.
I think we're going to have to - Well, we'll leave this here anyway magazine.
What goes in this VGX column?
That was the - that's the VGX residual at - before you spin.
Okay.
So just read the A.
Alright.
That was a beautiful burn.
God damn, I guess.
Whoo! Well, I have to vote with the 10 crew, that thing is brown.
Yes.
Sure is.
Looks tan to me.
But when I first saw it, at the other Sun angle...
Yes?
It looked gray.
it really looked gray.
Yes.
More - more Sun angle you get...
It got more - more brown - with increasing Sun angle.
Okay.
It's a long ways off.
Alright, let's - Okay, now we've got some things to do...
Okay, let's do them.
We got to do a Verb 66.
Hey, wait a minute - alright.
Buzz will want to do a Verb 82. Now, I don't know what comes first here.
Yes, Verb 82.
Well, I don't know if we're 60 miles or not, but at least we haven't hit that mother.
Look at that! Look at that! 169.6 by 60.9.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
What - what'd it say...
You want to write that down or something?
60.2.
Write it down, just for the hell of it. 170 by 60, like gangbustsers!
We only missed by a couple of tenths of a mile.
Hello, Moon. How's the old back side?
Well, it's...
Verb 66, alright?
Verb 66.
We won't need that other vector ever again.
Now, we're - PCM, Low, and we want to turn the tape recorder, Off?
Yes, why - I don't care.
Okay.
Why don't you go PCM, Low, and don't worry about the tape recorder; it's got 2 hours.
Okay.
Okay, we'll look at Service Module RCS - and SCS...
I want to look at the DAP again and enter a Verb 48, Enter.
What was our?
1500.
Okay.
You got all your things logged now?
Yes, sir, I'm all logged.
Okay.
Now, it says what we do is roll 180 and pitch down 70.
That do it? Alrighty, let's go to SCS and do it.
And...
Don't waste all the gas, now.
When I get around there, I'll pitch down 70, huh? What are we pitching down for, what, what, what...
We're going to - what we're...
I don't even know what we're doing.
Well, we're going to roll over and pitch down so we're looking out the front windows, down at the...
Oh, yes, okay.
Okay?
We can pitch down - picture...
can we take a picture...
pitch attitude.
Yes.
Now, we're going to have High Gain, and then we're...
How would you...
going to be able to...
like it with the...
look at the Moon ahead of us, coming out the window right now.
Can we see the Earth rising from here?
Well, there's gonna be an Earthrise...
We should be able to.
We gotta be precise. What was the time we got on it, Neil?
Yes, we can...
Neil?
What's that?
What was the time we got on it?
Burn time?
No, no...
Burn time or what?
We want the big camera, huh?
Big lens or small one?
Oh, it doesn't really matter. 80 millimeter will probably be as good for...
For the Earth coming up?
No, for the Earth...
No, for the Earth coming up, we want 250.
Might take some...
not sure we can get the Earth coming up...
might take some - some luck to get that, but...
Here, you want...
Tape recorder still running?
Yeah.
It doesn't matter, we've got 2 hours on that tape, and they don't care if you run out. As long as you're on Bit-rate Low.
Okay, infinity, at f:11 - and 1/250th, huh?
Okay, let me get my - let me get my gouge out here. I got my gouge...
You might want to back off a half stop to get the Earth...
Are you - you black and white or color?
Color.
Alrighty.
Moon, 5.6. Earth, 11; terminator, 1.8...
You think it's on your - your spot meter reading for the Earth?
Which way are you maneuvering now, friend?
5.6 at - 5.6 at 1/250th is probably...
Are you rolling?
Rolling?
You are, aren't you?
I'm rolling right.
Boy, there is some rough country over there.
You might get it coming sideways here. Stand by in case it does. What's the AOS time?
It was 15 with the burn. 15:23, something like that.
Just be with you in 10 seconds, Neil. I just want to get my...
We ought to be able to get it...
book put back together here.
a couple of good shots.
The Earth's going to be over here?
AOS, 76:15. That's exact...
Can you verify that you got the state vectors transferred with the Verb 83?
I'll do that.
Now, what else we got?
Coming up there.
Eyeballing and chattering. We got the burn status report? That's all?
Ready to go.
Okay, that looks good. Give me a Verb - 64.
What happened?
Ought to wash this window over here...
You have a map so we can look at.
Anybody got a...
Yes, it...
anybody got a Kleenex?
Yes, I think I've got one. Here you go.
Here's one; it's a little moist, though.
Well, one more burn.
Two more.
You got two more.
Yes, got a few more.
Look at those craters in a row. You see them right - going right out there?
Look at that line of them.
Something really peppered that one. There's a lot less variation in color than I would have thought, you know, looking down?
Yes, but when you look down, you say it's brownish color?
Sure.
Oh, golly, let me have that camera back. There's a huge, magnificent crater over here. I wish we had the other lens on, but God, that's a big beauty. You want to look at that guy, Neil?
Yes, I see him.
He's coming your way.
That dark spot.
Oh, let me - here, let me...
Well, there's no doubt that this is a little smaller than the Earth when you look at that curvature.
Look at that one.
Where is that dark spot? The dark spot's right up there.
You want to get the other lens on?
Yeah.
Don't you want to get the Earth coming up? It's going to be 9 minutes.
Yes, let's take some pictures here, first.
Well, don't miss that first one.
See how am I doing. Yes, you're right.
We'll need - we need to catch it about 10.
Shoot, you're going to have plenty of passes.
Yes, right.
Plenty of Earthrises, I guess.
Yes, we are.
Are we about there?
Boy, look at that crater. You can probably see him right there.
Yes, that's what I was talking about just a minute ago. It's kind of hard to believe that that's volcanic and formed by some faulting, isn't it? I don't believe that - but it's such a perfect straight line.
Hope none of those meteors come by right now.
Let me look through the sextant, Neil.
Well, where's the frapping Earth going to be now? I'm confused.
In plane, I hope.
How are you doing on your roll there?
Well, we got about another 60 degrees to go. When' s AOS?
Okay.
What a spectacular view!
God, look at that Moon!
Fantastic. Look back there behind us, sure looks like a gigantic crater; look at the mountains going around it. My gosh, they're monsters.
See that real big...
Yes, there's a moose down here you just wouldn't believe. There's the biggest one yet. God, it's huge! It is immense! It's so big I can't even get it in the window. You want to look at that? That's the biggest one you ever seen in your life. Neil? God, look at this central mountain peak.
Isn't that a huge one?
Look at the terraces. You get some pictures of that?
Yeah, I just took one. Can take another one here when he gets around a little better. Fantastic!
That's kind of a foggy window.
That's a horrible window. It's too bad we have to shoot through this one, but - Oh, boy, you could spend a lifetime just geologizing that one crater alone, you know that?
You could.
That's not how I'd like to spend my lifetime, but - picture that. Beautiful!
Yeah, there's a big mother over here, too.
Come on now, Buzz, don't refer to them as big mothers. Give them some scientific name.
It sure looks like a lot of them have slumped down.
A slumping big mother. Well, you see those every once in a while.
Most of them are slumping. The bigger they are, the more they slump - that's a truism, isn't it?
That is, the older they get.
Well, we're at 180 degrees, and now we're going to want to stop that and start a slow pitch down. We want to go...
We're not going to see the Earth come up over the horizon.
about 70 degrees.
It says pitch down or pitch up?
Pitch down, so we're looking forward.
Pitch down, so we're looking forward, alright. I wonder what kind of a rate we ought to...
We got 4 minutes to get down.
Alright.
Never make it. There's a couple of new craters.
There's a good view of that...
Look warm down there, Neil?
I sure can't tell.
Looks hotter than hell to me. Boy, look at the size of that one.
Golly! Whoo!
Get another picture of that big fellow.
Yeah. I'm going to take one out here of him.
I've got an Easter egg coming up, gentlemen.
That's good. Gosh, it's one o'clock already.
Hey, you know, we got a TV show at...
Huh?
The next rev around, that is.
Before LOI-2.
Yes.
Could you give me a gimbal angle to pitch to?
What are you going to do on that one?
Oh, I guess - get 10 pictures of the Moon.
What did you want, Mike?
A gimbal angle to pitch to - if it's pitchdown 70 - why, let's see, from 226, that's 70, that's 296?
Yeah, you were at 2...
296, I would guess. How many minutes we got - to AOS?
About another minute and a half.
