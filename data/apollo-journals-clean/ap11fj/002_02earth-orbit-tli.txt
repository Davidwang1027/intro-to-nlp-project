Uh, you... Houston Comm Tech. Canary Comm Tech.
Apollo 11, this is Houston through Canary. Over.
Roger. Reading you loud and clear. Our insertion checklist is complete, and we have no abnormalities.
Roger. And I'd like to pass up your Delta Azimuth correction at this time if you're ready to copy.
Stand by. [Pause.]
Roger. Go ahead. Ready to copy.
Okay. Delta azimuth correction is plus 0.22, that is plus .22, and we do recommend the P52 alignment. Over.
Okay. We'll go ahead with the P52, and deflecting angle [Delta Azimuth] plus 0.22.
Roger. And your LOS time at Canary is 23:37. Over.
23:37.
Houston. Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. One minute to LOS Canary. AOS at Tananarive 37:04 in VHF Simplex Alpha. Over. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Coming up on LOS Canary. AOS Tananarive at 37:04, Simplex Alpha. Houston. Out.
Apollo. Roger.
How are we doing on that time, anybody? Neil, are you sort of master of ceremonies on time, yet?
Well, I didn't...
[Singing] Okay, your Drinking Water Supply valve is On.
How about this [garble] circuit configuration? Glycol Reservoir Bypass valve, Open?
[Cough] Okay, we're ready for them. Bypass is Open.
Reservoir Out valve, Closed?
Out's Closed.
In valve, Closed?
In's Closed.
ECS Radiator Flow Control, Primary.
[Garble].
Hey, Buzz?
Yeah.
How would you like the camera?
Okay.
Primary Glycol to Radiator valve, Normal.
Where did I leave the dark slide?
Are we ready for that, you think? What's the time?
30 minutes. [Garble].
[Garble] to Normal, and check the radiator.
It will take a while, that's...
Okay, now, is that normal for the discharge pressure to zap down low and to do that? Do you think, Mike?
What's that? I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
When Neil sends the Glycol Radiators to Normal, temporarily, it...
It drops?
Yeah.
The temperature done that?
No, the pressure.
Yeah, pressure - you might get a little drop in it, I don't really know, but it came back up.
Yes, it goes back up.
Alright, Buzz, here's one Hasselblad for you. Coming around the right-hand couch.
Seems OK.
Buzz?
Yeah, just a second.
I'll just let go of it, Buzz. It will be hanging over here in the air. Coming up, it's occupying my couch.
Okay.
Just leave the dark slide with it?
Well, I thought about [garble] the dark slide or something, and then I thought we might need it later for a magazine change, so I left it with it.
Well, I know there's an orange dot on this [garble] somewhere.
That looks just a couple of degrees still above the...
Buzz, did you ever get that camera?
Yeah.
Okay.
Now, look.
Yeah, I guess it's 5 minutes after you do this before [garble].
It's, it's coming down, but it's...
Is it?
...as I said before, that's...
It looks like that's about equal to the inlet pressure.
Yeah, they're about - they're just about the same now.
Not getting much out of the radiator.
Okay, Buzz, are you ready for 16-millimeter?
Yes. How about a bracket?
Let Neil give you the bracket.
And the bracket - bracket slide...
Okay, Buzz, I'm going to have to do something about your couch. You mind sliding over to mine?
No, that's fine.
Could you - Can you work on that strap?
Oh, yeah, I will. Sure will. The - the one that your strut's off [garble] instrument panel.
Yeah. [Garble].
And you're happy with that?
That temperature's coming down a little bit now.
Yeah.
Now, let's see. You got an 18-millimeter on here, right?
Yeah.
So - do I push the thing all the way up? Is that right?
Yeah.
About with that white mark?
Yeah, one's for the 18, and one's for the 75. I - I think, just as long it looks like it's out - out the window, that's the main thing.
Did you get a secondary radiator leak check?
Yeah, we did that.
Okay. We're not hearing them, but we hear Tananarive.
Are we on Simplex A?
We're on Simplex A.
We're on Simplex A, but we're not due over Tananarive for another couple of seconds.
Okay.
What - [garble] time is 36 something...
Am I set up on VHF? Can you tell?
Yeah, just a second. Just a second - Your Master is On; your Intercom is On; your VHF is On; your Pad Comm is Off; your S-Band is On; and you're in Intercom Push-to-Talk, so you're all squared away, except for maybe Volume dial. Okay.
Now, Buzz, this item here at Canaries. LOS, 23:36. Potable Water Heater, Main A...
Yeah, I got that.
...PCM Bit Rate, Low...
I got that.
...You got all that, okay. Okay, when was the...
And the purge check's complete, and I'm working my way down to ECS.
Okay.
I'm having a hell of a time maintaining my body position down here. I keep floating up.
Well, there's such a great tendency to - to try and put a little force [garble] want to stay there. Just forget about all that and go wherever you want.
Okay, I got the Systems Test Meter set up on 4-B and ... attitude...
4-B, okay.
What are you reading?
I'm reading 3.5 volts.
[Garble] our attitude quantities...
Houston, Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, this is Houston through Tananarive. Over. [No answer.]
Hello, Houston, Apollo 11.
Optics Zero is Off. I'm going to jettison the dust cover...
Apollo 11, Apollo 11. This is Houston through Tananarive. Over. [Pause.]
Hello Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead.
Houston, Apollo 11. Read you on VHF A Simplex. How do you read? Over.
Roger, 11, this is Houston. We're reading you loud and fairly clearly. For your information, Canary radar shows you in a 103.0 by 103.0 orbit. Over.
Beautiful.
Roger. We concur.
We're just coming into the terminator here.
Now, I jettisoned the optics [covers]; I hope they went. Did you see it go? I heard a little something, but I...
Don't want to miss that.
No.
Can't really tell here. I think I'm seeing the horizon - out there, but I'm so [garble] far from being dark-adapted. It's hard to tell [garble] a double blind on this?
Yeah.
What was our Z torquing angle? 0.22, wasn't it?
That's right, plus.
Sure's a big one, isn't it? Okay, well, I'm standing by to do this...
Got A and B down.
IMU align. Unstow the optics handles. Anybody wants any of that claptrap out of R-1, now is the time to say it.
Give me that little circular job.
Alright, I'll - I'll look for it, Buzz. Let me get these - optics handles. I guess I really didn't mean what I said right when I said it a little while - Oh, I knew there was something messed up.
You say you had about 3-point-something volts up there?
Yeah. [Garble] and on the [garble].
3.4?
3.45, something like that...
Oh, that's - that's the minimum. 3.4, 4.1. And if you whip it over to 4-A, if...
Okay, 4-A is 3.8. Okay.
No, 4-A.
4-A?
Yeah.
And 3.8.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. One minute to LOS Tananarive. AOS Carnarvon is at 52:15. Over.
Apollo 11. Roger.
52:15.
You want some of these lights down further, Mark...Mike?
Don't worry about it for the time being. I'm potting around with handholds right now, Neil...
That battery compartment pressure, Mike, it ought to be less than 1.5. However, it says NA until first vent.
Okay.
It's greater than 1.5; that vent - vent...
Well, we haven't even vented yet.
Trapped.
Yeah.
Man, we are in the dark, now.
TAN LOS.
You got any reading off that Repress O2 to be greater than [garble].
We got - No, not quite that much. That's that crazy gauge.
Okay, can I have the DSKY now?
Yeah, you got it. [Garble] 50 degrees...
Well, here's your acid test.
Okay, what did he say, 52...
52... per cent, about.
As I say, I can't see [garble]. Let me know if you want me to [garble] come back.
It's - Menkent.
... ball on that pad. It's maintaining about 39 degrees, Mike.
Yes, I noticed that. Before, it was maintaining less than that; it was abnormally low. I almost asked them about it during boost, and then I decided to heck with it. Damn, it's been hard to see through these optics [garble] down a little bit. Okay, proceed to Menkent. There she goes, Menkent.
Menkent. God, what a star.
Nobody in their right...
Menkent's good...
...nobody in their right mind would pick that one.
...Menkent's a good star.
Hey, I sure wish you'd get out that - that star chart.
Can't see a thing, huh?
No. It's in the...
Did you look in the telescope?
...in the sextant. Yes, but I can't see it in the telescope. In the sextant - I can't.
Okay.
I believe it's at the angle we have to mark on it.
It's a little on the chilly side in the cabin. Would you like...
Feels comfortable to me.
...would you like it a little warmer, anybody?
I don't think so. I think it's a little on the...
The manual one.
It sure doesn't look, sure doesn't feel like - Actually, it may be a little - it may be a little warm.
Well, my - my feet are a little chilly. See, it's 47. Okay, 37 is...
No, that's...
...is Nunki. What?
Okay. Hey, Buzz?
What?
Did you write down any marks on 30 and on 37?
I was going to mark on 37, and that's Nunki; 30 and 37?
Yes, sir.
I can see some stars. Well, maybe I...
Okay, again, again looking through the telescope, I'm absolutely unable to tell if it's Nunki, but I have it in the sextant. So let's mark on it.
You guys would appreciate doing this with old G&N men.
0.01.
0.01, alright. Shoot, I forget, I think that's gray Gienah.
Cup of coffee around here later on, when you get a little time.
Would you like that, Neil? ... five balls...You want us to record that star?
I got it, I got it. Go ahead.
Let's see, what's tearing me up is we're going orb-rate on this damn booster, and the rate is very evident.
Okay, Z torque is plus 0.152 instead of 122. I suppose that's close enough. Now then, you got those numbers written down, Buzz?
Copy.
Okay. Now I - I - if I remember right, I think you're just supposed to torque without further ado. We give them the time at which we torque. So, as soon as you got them written down, let me know and I'll proceed and you can mark the time.
I've got it.
Okay, here we go. Proceed, torque.
48:15. Got that.
Okay, now I - I'm going to verify with the third star, and let's see what that star's going to be. Star number 34...
Atria.
...is Atria. You might note that, Buzz, also. I think...
34?
Yes, I think that's the third star. It'll say somewhere in that checklist. Proceed to Atria. Alright, if IMU is realigned, realign the GDC.
0.1 degree. Probably GDC's off a lot more than that.
Okay, and Atria is there in the sextant. Well, you know, it's not right in the middle of the sextant. Of course, I guess - I don't know what - Have you ever heard any rules on what constitutes a good third star check?
No, all you're really doing is seeing that you've got the right stars, it seems to me.
It's there, but it's not dab smack in the middle of the sextant. It's off, I would guess, 0.02 or some crazy number like that. Alright, having done that, Verb 37, Enter; [garble] Enter, and I'm going Optics Zero and Manual, and cranking up the floodlights down here.
God, I'll tell you, the visibility through that telescope is a big disappointment. It's piss poor.
Okay, Buzz, got all that good stuff?
GDC's realigned, okay...
Reticle brightness, again I don't know anything about that. Stow optics eyepieces, okay, that's in work.
And [garble] out there right now. [Garble], Buzz?
Neil, I haven't been looking out. My eyes aren't very well adapted.
You got your light on?
Yeah, look at those bright ones down here.
Lightning! Is that lightning out your window?
No, I haven't seen any lightning.
Hell, that must be lightning. Either that or it's the atmosphere.
You know, no matter how many times I put these optics eyepieces...
I just saw something. Maybe it is the atmosphere. They said that Borman's... [crew? Apollo 8] could see it. They couldn't hear it, but they could see it alright.
Yeah.
No matter how many times I put these optics eyepieces in their box, it doesn't seem right.
0.01, God damn it! Now that's enough to piss a body off.
[Garble] right that time.
S-band noise.
We're about to get - 10 seconds until acquisition.
Okay.
Okay, and my optics eyepieces are stowed.
You want me to take your checklist, Mike, and kind of skim through it?
It says here, coming up on Carnarvon LOS at...
Apollo 11, this is Houston through Carnarvon. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Loud and clear. Over.
Roger, 11. We're reading you the same. Both the booster and the spacecraft are looking good to us. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Would you like to copy the alignment results?
That's affirmative.
Okay. Noun 71, we used 30 and 37; four balls 1; Noun 93, plus 00016, plus 00033, plus 00152; GET 00:48:15; check star 34. Over.
Roger. Say again check star.
Check star 34.
Roger. We copy. And the angles look good.
And tell Glenn Parker down at the Cape that he lucked out.
Understand. Tell Glenn Parker he lucked out.
Yeah, he lucked out. He doesn't owe me a cup of coffee.
This is Houston. Roger, we'll pass it on.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. One minute to LOS Carnarvon. AOS at Honeysuckle 59:33. Over.
Apollo 11. Roger.
Roger. And we request you turn up the S-Band volume for the Honeysuckle pass.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston on S-band. Radio check. Over.
Roger, Houston. Apollo 11 reads you loud and clear.
This is Houston. Roger. Reading you the same. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. A little over 1 minute to LOS at Honeysuckle. You'll be AOS at Goldstone at 1:29:02. LOS at Goldstone 1:33:55. Over.
Let...let me tell them about the TV...
Roger, Bruce. Thank you. We expect TV. We've got it all hooked up. We have not yet turned it on. We're ready to do that now.
Roger. We copy. We'll be configured and waiting for whatever you want to send down.
Okay, you think we can do that?
That's fine with us.
This one here?
Tell them that we've got nothing to do here but re-check it here for the next 20 minutes or so.
Okay. I'm ready to turn the TV on. Play with it [garble] flashlight [garble] hook it up [garble].
Want a - [garble]? Mike?
No.
Yes, I'd love one, Neil, thank you. I just stuck it in my pocket.
Can I give you the wrapping back?
[Laughing] Now that is a problem, trying to find...
It's a gooey one. Gooey when the paper doesn't want to come off, but thanks anyway.
... something about the [garble]...
It's a...
No, I think it's...
What was you doing? [Laughter]
I don't know [garble] I almost lost it. I figured I'd really go along with the [garble] and put some of that ointment on - so slick that I rubbed my ring off [Laughter].
Is that right?
Yes.
Have we got any daylight? I can't see outside at all.
Nothing yet, [garble].
How are you going to rig that up, Michael?
Well, Buzz, I'm going to hold it out that hatch window.
Hand hold it?
Yeah - yeah, yeah, hand hold it. Don't dick with that.
Buzz can hold it, and you're going to run the monitor. Have you got enough...?
Uh huh.
Mike, how about this thing?
Repress. Let's see, it's supposed to be - 865.
Go ahead.
And it - it kind of varies between - not 865, but it's - 830.
[Garble].
Well, I don't know how it - that ought to [garble].
I can turn - turn it on Fill for a minute, if you want. That's what we need to do, I think.
Maybe the [garble] this son of a bitch is working or not.
You got the power switches turned on up there at the...
Uh huh. [Garble].
...
Let's get into the Hasselblad... get the right settings on it.
Okay.
Is Goldstone the only station that's going to get this?
Yes, that's all. That's the only one that's got a scanner/converter. We've only got about 4 minutes, looks like.
That must be doing something.
Yes.
How long...
You got it on infinity for one thing. Let me put it down here.
...how long is it supposed to take to...
[Garble]?
No, no, it's the one with the [garble].
Okay, it's, it's working somewhat. It's just the question of not enough light in here when I get it.
Yes.
[Garble]. It's, I think, working okay.
We ought to be coming out into the daylight here in a little bit. Get it all shaped up?
I think it's fine. Now the one thing I forget about this is this zoom.
Do we want to write on this what, what we're taking pictures of?
12.5-millimeter.
Who knows about zoom lenses? This lens goes from 12.5-millimeters to 75. I assume that's the same nomenclature as on a camera. Right, 75 is zoom...
I would think so.
...and 12.5 is wide angle. The only thing that's confusing me is that it says for vehicle-to-vehicle - We want to be zoom on 12.5. I guess they just want to make sure you got the other vehicle in view. Probably that's why they said that rather than telephoto.
Okay, well, then, I'll put the zoom on 12.5.
Okay. You didn't put this ...?
No, I didn't [garble] Min [garble].
I've got bright.
Focus, I'll put at infinity, and the f-stop for vehicle-to-vehicle is...
Not much light in here.
...f:2.8.
What?
Okay. I - I'll show what it looks like inside of the cabin.
Okay, this looks alright, I think.
Point that at Neil or point it at somebody who's in the light. Yeah, we'll get it. Can't see it [garble]. You want to see the monitor?
[Garble].
Yes. You want to see the monitor?
Is this all ready to go? I'm going to put it back over here. It's over here under your stuff. Now, it seems to me if Buzz wants his camera to drift up, so what I ought to do is probably - Hey, Buzz!
Yeah.
Hey, it seemed to stick pretty well if you stood it up on the - with the lens kind of pointing out. There are two pieces of Velcro over there.
Okay.
There are two pieces on the back of them [garble].
You think so, huh?
Yeah, over, just a little up toward the [garble].
Now, [garble] - it's rolling around, so I can start looking outside, upside down.
I don't know, I think we'd almost be better just by looking at the monitor, Buzz.
Yes, yes, but this way I think I'll know how to...
...which way to move it.
Are you going the right way for those hoses? It looks to me like you ought to roll over the other way.
Hey, there's something out that window?
[Garble].
When you get around there, Buzz, I'll give you the briefing [Laughter].
No. I...
You just slid out of your...
I was out of my [garble].
Handkerchief or something...
Where do we have to go to get a tissue?
All the way down to the guts.
How about - using a piece of cloth, like...
While I'm here, let me...
What, what - do you want a tissue for?
Hey, that's a good idea. We can get rid of that stuff...
[Garble].
...that's a good idea; get ahead.
Brilliant [garble].
I got your checklist, Mike. You want it back?
Yes, I'll take it back, Neil. Thank you, just put it here.
No, you got Buzz's checklist here. You gave me Buzz's.
Excuse me.
[Garble] I'd rather have my own.
How does the checklist look to you, Neil? You happy with it?
Yeah, it looks fine to me.
Good.
I'll take your word for it, but the SPS and ECS and the EPS are now on...
[Garble] take a lot...
Yeah, I'll do that. Are you ready for me to hand you your light test?
No, one-handed snap. [Garble] I'm in the center now. That was probably my first mistake.
Okay, Buzz, the...
Alright, I'll put yours on the left.
It doesn't matter, they're all good. Far as I'm concerned, one's like another.
As a matter of fact, I'll put yours on the right.
Okay.
[Garble].
This 16-millimeter camera, Buzz, with the 18-millimeter lens - you got it shoved all the way up toward the window. I think we can - on this bracket.
Yes.
Okay, that was correct. You, you were asking about that.
And you have 6 frames per second, and it's color. You got 15 minutes worth, 6 frames a second, f:8, infinity, 1/250th. Okay...
The only question is, how much do we want to indicate on that?
Outside of it, on the magazine?
Yes.
How does zero g feel? Your head feel funny, anybody, or anything like that?
No, I don't know, it just feels like we're going around upside down.
[Garble] I don't know - even feel that.
I feel the horizon coming up.
Oh, yeah.
Buzz, are you ready for...
[Garble] 90 degrees the wrong way...
Are you ready for this briefing, Buzz?
Yes, let me get this.
Oh! Okay.
Oh, yes, stand by for sunrise.
Say, we got the rookie with us. He hasn't seen so many of those.
[Laughter.] Okay. 30 seconds.
Oh, no, there is a possibility.
We haven't got too many of them on this flight, so you might as well enjoy it while you can. Buzz, how are you doing?
Okay, go ahead and talk.
Okay, I'd like to show this to you while I'm talking. It's pretty much like a camera. It has the - the f-stop control is right here, and you set it on f:22 which, of course, lets in the smallest amount of light, and that's a safety precaution. Now, later you'll probably find that you want to go away from f:22. Okay? Under zoom, your zoom control, can you see? The zoom is the middle one, and you're 12.5-millimeters on the middle one. See the 12.5-millimeters? That's the zoom.
Yes.
Focus is on infinity. You ought to just leave that on infinity; no doubt about that. Now, the zoom, they may want you to zoom in on the horizon a little bit, or the land or whatever. I'd start out with a wide angle at 12.5, and I'd start out with this on f:22 just for protection against getting too much light in. In all likelihood, you'll have to change that a little bit.
I think that - that's going to do it.
Yes, that looks good. I don't see how that can miss.
Jesus Christ, look at that horizon!
Isn't that something?
God damn, that's pretty! This is unreal. I'd forgotten.
Get a picture of that.
Ooh, sure, I will. I've lost a Hasselblad. Has anybody seen a Hasselblad floating by? It couldn't have gone very far, big son of a gun like that.
Now, what do we have - Is that all the...?
You had the switch on inside. [Garble]. Oh yeah. Okay. [Garble] automatic light control features.
Well, that pisses me off! Hasselblad gone. Find that mother before she or I ends the [garble]. Everybody look for a floating Hasselblad. I see a pen floating loose down here, too. Is anybody missing a ballpoint pen?
Got mine. Is it ballpoint, or is it [garble]?
Yes, ballpoint. Here it is. I mean felt tip.
[Garble] much embarrassed to say they've lost a Hasselblad. I seem to be prone to that.
And we're about 7 minutes away, so we got about 7 minutes of practice time.
I looked... I've looked everywhere over here for that Hasselblad, and I just don't see it.
You can go to your [garble].
It's too late for sunrise, anyway.
I know, but I'm worried about...
But you want to get it before TLI. [Trans-lunar Injection.]
...I know it. That's what I'm worried about.
Neil, could you look around over there?
Yes, I'll look.
I don't know if we want to go through any wild contortions looking for it. Do we have to throw some other switches?
No, the switches are all thrown.
[Garble] under you.
Buzz, you don't see the Hasselblad anywhere down below?
Let me go on a little expedition here. Has somebody [garble]?
I've looked already.
Ah! Here it is.
Find it?
Yes.
Beautiful.
It was floating in the aft bulkhead.
On your side?
I got a way of, of keeping it.
I got a little horizon. Man, look at that!
Looks like what you have to do with this, is not hold it against the window, because it's going to pick up...
How's the monitor, working okay for you? Anything I can do to help?
[Garble].
I found a spot that really [garble] my window.
Yes, it looks like [garble] I got my...
Trees and a forest down there. It looks like trees and a forest or something. Looks like snow and trees. Fantastic. I have no conception of where we're pointed or which way we are or a crapping thing, but it's a beautiful low pressure cell out here.
Yes, go ahead and take a picture. Keep your [garble] down.
Beautiful low pressure.
Must be past Hawaii by now. 01:28 is AOS.
Buzz, how's it going there, the monitor giving you good service?
Not yet - flicking an awful lot.
Well, that's [garble] - It looks to me like you're home free. Just remember now, you're going to have to get that f-stop probably off f:22, maybe not - focus stays on infinity and the zoom beats me. You can take your choice, you can zoom with that thing all the way in if you take it fairly slowly.
Sun is bright, isn't it? It's a pretty nice camera, to tell you the truth.
I think you probably want sort of a wide angle...
Yes, I think [garble] would be something [garble].
Well, if I take normal to the window, it's going to be [garble], [garble]?
Yes, that would be pretty nice.
Getting a little of the rim there?
To get a little more view, you have to move down, away from...
Now, how we doing checklist-wise? Let's make sure we don't screw up and forget...
I'm working on the attitude reference check right now.
Now, do we need to do anything else to configure this for [garble] receiver?
No, far as I know, it's all up to them.
Oh, shoot! They're going to - Let's see, they're going to have to send us up a TLI PAD, TLI abort, and a P37 PAD. They're all right here in this little book. Don't forget to remind me of that.
Okay, that's good.
How do you think we can...?
Yes, you can fold it flat. Would that help you?
Yes.
That's pull - pull...
See that, Buzz? You're a TV expert.
Now, the next big thing we got to do is, after the attitude reference check, is extend the docking probe. No big thing. Copy down a bunch of PADs and then you got your RCS hot-fire.
That booster, when that thing...
Apollo 11, this is Houston through Guaymas. Over.
Roger, Houston. Reading you loud and clear.
Roger. Reading you the same. Coming up on AOS Goldstone.
Roger. [Pause.]
It should be right now, Buzz.
Cecil B. DeAldrin is standing by for instructions.
Houston. Roger.
Okay, and I got PADs, need to extend the probe, and do an SM RCS hotfire.
That's right, that's the same way I read it. I don't know what this is, coming up.
When you, when you come up on this SECS Logic, and MSFN Go for pyro arm, don't forget to get an Okay from them before you send the logic out.
Wow, I hope they get that. That's pretty.
With the Sun glaring like it is, you're - you're correct on the f:22, I'm sure. It might be part of the...
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We're not receiving your FM downlink yet. We're standing by. [No answer.]
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We're receiving your FM downlink now. We're standing by for TV modulation on the signal. [No answer.]
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Roger. Loud and clear. We think we're transmitting to you.
Okay. We're not receiving it yet, 11, although we've confirmed presence of your FM downlink carrier.
Which switches do you want us to confirm?
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, this is Houston. You were just on the fringes of coverage from Goldstone. We have just had LOS at Goldstone, and we'd like to push on and get the PAD messages read up to you here shortly.
Roger. We are ready to copy. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, this is Houston. I am ready with your TLI-plus-90-minute abort PAD. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, this is Houston. I'm ready with your TLI-plus-90-minute abort PAD.
Roger. Apollo 11 is ready to copy TLI plus 90.
Go.
Roger. TLI plus 90, SPS G&N: 63481, minus 1.53, plus 1.32; GETI, 004:10:25:38; Noun 81, minus 0476.1, plus 0000.1, plus 5336.1; roll, 180, 193, 000; HA is NA; plus 0020.3, 5357.3, 6:33, 5334.9; sextant star 33, 157.8, 12.2. The boresight star is not available. Latitude, minus 02.52, minus 025.80, 1188.7, 34345, 016:03:50. GDC align, Vega and Deneb, roll, 071, 291, 341. No ullage, undocked. And I have your P37 for TLI plus 5 hours. Over.
Go ahead, TLI plus 5.
Roger. P37 format, TLI plus 5: 007:44, 6485, minus 165, 025:06. Readback. Over.
Roger. TLI plus 90, SPS G&N: 63481, minus 1.53, plus 1.32; 004:10:25:38; minus 0476.1, plus 0000.1, plus 5336.1; 180, 193, 000; not applicable, plus 0020.3; 5357.3, 6:33, 5334.9; 33, 157.8, 12.2; not available; minus 02.52, minus 025.80; 1188.7, 34345, 016:03:50. Vega and Deneb, 071, 291, 341. No ullage, undocked. P37, TLI plus 5: 00744 6485, minus 165 02506. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Readback correct. For your information, Goldstone reports receiving approximately 1 minute of FM downlink carrier. We were getting ready to request you confirm on the S-band Aux switches, the S-band Aux tape switch to Off and the S-band Aux TV switch to TV. Over.
I confirm that that is the configuration we're in.
Roger. Let us do a little more detective work here and we'll see if we can come up with something.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 11 is ready to go ahead with the - extend the docking probe, and ready to go with the RCS hot fire when you're ready to monitor. Over.
Roger. Go ahead with the probe, now.
Roger.
Okay. We're - we're ready to - for the hot fire check when you're ready.
Roger. We're ready 11. Go ahead.
Roger. Here's the pitch. [Long pause.]
11, this is Houston. We're seeing the pitch hot firing and it looks good.
Roger. Be advised that we are unable to hear 'em.
Roger. We copy.
Have you seen all three axes fire?
We've seen pitch and yaw; we've not seen roll to date.
Okay. I'll put in a couple more rolls.
Okay. We've got the roll impulses, and you're looking good here.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. We're standing by for a Go for sequence logic On.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead and we'll watch you on TM.
Okay. Sequence logic, two of them. [Pause.] Sequence logic 1 and 2 coming up and On.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. You are Go for Pyro Arm.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you can give us P00 and Accept, we have a state vector update for you.
Roger.
You have P00 and Accept.
Roger. It will probably be another 10 or 15 seconds. We're going to go up through the Vanguard. When you're ready to copy, I have your TLI PAD.
Roger. Ready to copy TLI PAD.
Roger. TLI: 2:35:14; 179, 071, 001, burn time 5:47, 10435.6, 35575. Roll for Sep 357, 107, 041; 301, 287, 319. TLI 10-minute abort pitch, 223. Readback. Over.
Roger. TLI PAD: 2:35:14; 179, 071, 001; 5:47, 10435.6, 35575; 357, 107, 041; 301, 287, 319. TLI 10-minute abort pitch, 223. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Roger. Would you read back Delta-VC prime again? You were cut out by some noise.
Okay. Roger. I'm picking up the squeal here, also. Delta-VC 10435.6. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Readback correct. Out. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We've completed the uplink; the computer is yours. You can go back to Block. And would you verify that you have extended the probe? Over.
Roger. That's verified. The probe is extended.
Roger. About 2 minutes to LOS on this state-side pass. AOS Canaries at 1:50:13. Over.
Roger. 1:50... [13]
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 11. Loud and clear.
Okay. On your Service Module RCS quad Bravo package temperature, we're showing it running a little low. Looks like about 20 degrees low - lower than the rest of the quads. Would you confirm that your RCS heater switch for quad Bravo is in Primary? Over.
You're correct. It was not in Primary. It was off. It's on now. Thank you.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead.
Roger. We've checked over the spacecraft and the launch vehicle guidance. They're both looking to be in good shape. We estimate you have better than a 99-percent probability of a guidance cut-off on the launch vehicle, so things are apparently holding in very well. For your information, MILA received approximately 1 minute of a usable TV picture, so apparently the system is working. And you're a little over a minute from LOS at Canary. AOS Tananarive is 2 hours, 9 minutes and 18 seconds. Over.
Roger. We like those 99 numbers. Thank you.
Roger. Out.
Okay.
Now, let's see. We want to go to the suit circuit...
Yes, I'll get the suit circuit if I can find that valve.
Okay, let's see, that's the EDS Power, On.
Oh, that thing is hard.
What, what do we want here...
Suit's closed.
...on that Verb 48?
Ready for EDS Power, On, you think?
EDS Power, up and On, yes.
Okay, it's On.
EMS Function, Off, verify.
EMS Function, Off.
Mode, Standby - EMS Mode, Standby.
Okay, it's at Standby.
EMS Function, Delta-V; set range VHF A.
Okay.
Set for 1586.8.
Okay.
Then go to Normal. Anybody know what we're doing with Verb 48 up there?
What are we supposed to be putting in there?
[Garble].
I wonder what the hell that is?
Just verify you got a 3 there?
I guess so, that's what you need.
That's all you need.
Yes.
I don't know what that entry is in the checklist.
It doesn't matter what the other numbers are.
No, I mean any - any other weights or anything?
No.
Doesn't seem to me, for the PAD we got, we - we want to load in any...
No.
...any of this stuff. That's what we got in there, anyway.
Yes.
Maybe we can change the weight, but that's TLI plus 90; we got plenty of time.
We don't want to do that.
No.
It's almost the same anyway.
It's about the same anyway, yes.
Okay. You ready for the - your EMS Mode, Normal?
Normal.
EMS Function to Delta-V Test.
That's good; that light enough.
[Garble].
Now, we want a GDC Align.
Yes.
Now, let's see...
Minus 19.9.
That's alright. Minus 0.1 to - can you write that one down?
It's real close.
Yes.
That's just about perfect.
Alright. EMS Mode, Standby.
Standby.
And EMS Function, Delta-V, set. Set Delta-VC. You got the number?
Yes. 10 4356.
4256? I thought it was 4356?
That's right, 4356.
And how about ORDEAL? Does that go back, Buzz?
Yep.
I guess we got all of those...
Where did all those numbers come from?
Yes; much better.
They give us a new state vector?
Yes.
Yeah, they did.
They did, yes.
No, that's Verb 66. [Garble] apogee - perigee.
I'll just put a question mark here about - not show our ignorance.
Well, looks like we're picking up a little. That sound reasonable? 11667
[Garble] the time, is that right?
The S-IVB?
Yes, you add about 4 or 5 miles to your orbit - apogee - perigee.
Yes.
Yes, that's too much.
We're up to 6 [garble].
That thing [garble] now, that may not be now; that may be at TLI.
I don't have any reason not to believe it.
No.
If it isn't any good, we'll need another one anyway, huh? So, there isn't any point in saving the other one.
Okay.
Verb 66.
Okay. 10 435.6.
10 435.6. Alright, go to EMS Function, Delta-V.
Delta-V.
GDC align is at - What's this D?
Huh?
That means [garble].
Oh.
Won't get them on S-band.
S what?
VHF.
Okay. A Simplex, it should be on.
Set ORDEAL? Do something with it, anyway.
Let's see, ORDEAL is...
What happened to that card that was here?
I already fired it.
What was that?
Um hum.
Saturn boost? This was a boost card.
Okay.
You can't have that.
You don't want that one, do you?
No.
Trade it - for a good one.
How about some LM pointing angles?
Okay, let's do one more. We're going first opportunity, you think?
Burn time is 5 plus 47.
Uh huh.
And the emergency shutdown, Neil, is plus 10 seconds; 10 minus 40 on the Delta-VC, is that right?
Plus 6 seconds, plus 6.
And - no - no, I'm sure about that minus.
No, no, it's not; it's only [garble].
No, it's plus 6 seconds and VI on the DSKY at G&N.
I think that's going to show up here, isn't it?
What?
TLI?
The roll?
Burn [garble].
They're in the damn Flight Plan; I don't think they're in the checklist.
Alright. You got ORDEAL set in some way?
ORDEAL is okay.
Well, do you want to get ahead on a few things?
Well, give me an example.
We don't need the sequence pyro arm, you know.
No. Don't want to do that until...
Trans Control Power, On?
It's On.
Rot Control Power, Normal, two of them, AC/DC?
There you go.
Direct, two, Main A, Main B?
Okay.
Launch Vehicle indicators: GPI to S-II/S-IVB. Guidance to IU.
That IU?
Uh huh.
Have we got pyros armed?
No.
No.
Okay.
CB, Direct Ullage, two of them, Closed.
Better wait a while on that.
Okay, how about cranking the event timer to 51:00, then?
What's burn time? Ignition time? Two what?
35, 30 minutes.
Well, that's going to be [garble].
Okay, I'll set up the event timer.
Burn time is 05:20.
Delta-VI is gonna be [garble].
Sure you got - you got your checklist here, haven't you? Yeah.
Yes. They put all this TLI crap in my checklist; even though I took it out, they put it back in.
Well, Mattingly assured me that I was going to have a circular velocity versus altitude, you know, when they get me at 100 miles on the other side?
It's not in here, either, I looked.
Where would it be? It'd be right in here...
I finally gave it to [garble].
Hey, that's - you know what the numbers are, roughly.
25 - 25,550 at a 100 miles - something like that, it changes, probably...
Yes, but this was to be - What do you have on this side to give you that on the other side?
I'm running a little bit on the warm side. How are you guys [garble] along?
Probably a tad on the warm side.
Suit and cabin pressures both look as if we should be cool.
Should be about 100 [garble] - okay...
Water - boiling - [garble] potable. Okay.
Fuel cells [garble] fuel cells making water. It goes to potable tank first and then the waste tank.
Oh - stop there?
Yes.
Coming into the terminator.
Gee, I'm really disappointed over those optics; that telescope is horrible. Maybe it'll get better with practice, or adaptation, or what have you.
Apollo 11, this is Houston through Tananarive. How do you read? [No answer. Long pause.]
Gee, I almost went to sleep here.
Me, too. I'm taking a little rest.
Apollo 11, this is Houston standing by through Tananarive. [No answer.]
It's going to be a long day.
How'd the - is this the first part of the attitude comparison check or the second part?
Tananarive, Houston Comm Tech Net 1.
I haven't done the second GDC align yet; it comes up on the next page. About now, I guess.
Tananarive, Houston Comm Tech Net 1.
Goddard voice, Houston Comm Tech Net 1.
Well, we should have Tananarive. How about going - pressing ahead with the sequence pyro arm?
Goddard: Voice, reading you loud and clear.
Roger. We cannot raise Tananarive.
Okay, let me align the GDC.
Houston Comm Tech, Tananarive.
Roger, Tananarive. Are you receiving CapCom's voice, and are you uplinking it?
Negative.
Roger. Monitor this - Monitor again and I'll have CapCom make one more transmission.
Well, they cleverly do this on, just on opposite sides of the world so you always have to pitch - run all the thumbwheels the maximum amount.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston standing by through Tananarive. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11...
Roger. Reading you loud and clear.
You get the pyro armed?
No, I haven't. Just a second, I'll be right with you.
Get 51 on the event timer?
We stopped boiling water.
That's good.
Old son of a gun.
Okay on the temperatures.
Looks like the setting on the Auto thing is such that it just runs a little cold.
Yes, that's right. That's - that's what I think, too.
[Garble] have a feeling I have a ball in here.
Okay, the GDC is - is aligned. Ready to proceed.
Okay. We've got the Verb 48 in, Verb 83, ORDEAL set, and Sequence Pyro Arm.
Okay. Stand by for a blast. One's On. Two's On.
Houston, Apollo 11. We have the Pyros armed.
Okay.
This is Houston. Roger. Out.
Trans Control Power's On. Rot Control Power, Normal, two, AC/DC.
They're all up.
Direct? Main A, Main B.
Direct.
S-II/S-IVB.
Check.
Guidance, IU?
IU, yes.
Circuit breakers, Direct Ullage, two, closed.
Okay.
And the event timer's set.
Now, why don't you - why don't you put ORDEAL on 200/Lunar?
Alright.
Maybe you can start figuring out what the hell that ought to be.
I guess leave them on Inertial for the time being.
Beyond my ability to compute here right now.
[Garble]?
You're not worried now on that thing?
When the motor lights up, he's worried.
[Garble] 190, 110 degrees.
Got a long way around, yet.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. One minute to LOS Tananarive. AOS at Carnarvon 2:25:30.
Roger.
2:25:30.
Uh huh, 02:25:30. [Garble].
Why did they do that? That should be up here, before 2:35.
I don't know. It's screwed up in here anyway.
Well, weren't they giving us two abort PADs before?
No, TLI plus 90 and TLI plus 4 hours. And now the TLI plus 4 hours is TLI plus 5 hours, P37.
Oh, is that right?
Uh huh. Got them on the same page.
Yeah, they're on the same page.
Yeah, I was expecting them to get something in.
Going to have to break your DSKY and your LEB handhold.
Oh, my G&N handhold! Don't do that. I just managed to hang on to it, gonna use up there.
Holding against the [garble] - the couch.
Well, let's see [garble].
Think I was that slow punching the clock?
Huh?
I wonder if I was that slow getting everything going? I ought to have given them a second or...
It didn't seem to me as though there was a tremendous cue; there's no doubt that you were moving, but to say exactly what the precise time was when you started to move, I think you'd call it whenever the thing started vibrating.
Yeah, I didn't know when the hell we were airborne. I just took his word for it. It was sure shaking, rattling, and rolling, son of a bitch!
Wake me up at TLI, somebody.
Another 15 minutes, just time to sleep.
You need to get out the alarm clock.
I don't know, I think I'll just put my window guard up.
Yeah.
Whopseedoo, we picked up an S-band. No noise.
What's Verb 85 going to tell me - if I call that up, Mike?
It tells you range - range rate in C, which is the angle between your - optics line of sight and the horizon, depending on what...
What's that little bump in the [garble] somebody?
That's me. I - I'm thrashing around over here a little bit.
I - if you wonder, I stuffed my launch checklist and - in the little gap between the...
You don't have a launch checklist.
My cue card.
Oh.
In between the - the Y-Y strut and the wall over here, to keep it from bouncing around.
Oh.
[Garble].
Yes, that says 58½ degrees, huh?
Uh huh.
[Garble] 57½ isn't that something like that? Now wait a minute.
Yes, 57½ degrees.
I guess they're [garble] about on the horizon anyway. Yes, okay.
Huh?
Buzz, I put 39.5 volts over here. That's a reminder on the battery check - real good on the wall. Okay, Neil, now TLI: I'm going to write on the wall here - TLI - nominal is 5 plus 47. And 6 seconds later, it's 5 plus 53. And you want me to let you know when that is? I'll yell cut-off at that time.
Okay.
Now, we want to get what that time is going to be up there.
Is that right, Neil?
Yeah, that's right. 5:53, I want it yelled.
Okay. I'll yell cut-off, huh?
Yes, I guess. And I'll cut off if the G&N says...
Agreed.
...we're over-burned.
That's right.
You got that Translunar switched to Inject, huh?
Yes, to Inject.
EDS Power, you got On?
EDS Power is On.
Pyros are armed?
Pyros are...four breakers are in, and switches are up.
Okay, on this thing here, we should be reading 2:41:01, shutdown, and adding 6 seconds to it?
Uh huh.
At 07, cut-off.
Block, Block. Spacecraft Control to SCS?
It is.
Tank pressures looking alright?
Tank pressures are looking good.
Apollo 11, this is Houston through Carnarvon. Radio check. Over.
Roger, Houston through Carnarvon. Apollo 11. Loud and clear.
Roger. You're coming in very loud and very clear, here. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. You are Go for TLI. Over.
Apollo 11. Thank you.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, 11.
Roger. We'll be coming within range of the ARIA aircraft coverage, here, in about one minute. They're going to try uplinking both on S-band and on VHF this time. So if you turn your - make sure your S-band volume is turned up, we'd appreciate it. And we believe that we'll have continuous coverage from now on through the TLI burn. Over.
Very good.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston through ARIA 4. Radio check. Over.
Houston, we read you strength 4 and a little scratchy.
Roger. We're reading you strength 5, readability about 3. Should be quite adequate.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. We're reading you readability about 3, strength 5. Sounds pretty good. Over.
Roger. We've got a little static in the background now.
Apollo 11, this is Houston through ARIA 3. Radio check. Over.
Roger, Houston, Apollo 11. You are much clearer and adequately loud. Over.
Roger, 11, You are coming in five-by-five here. Beautiful signal.
This is a lot better than this static we had previously.
Okay.
And we got the timebase fix indication on time.
This is Houston. Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We just got telemetry back on your booster, and it's looking good.
Roger. Everything looks good here.
Houston, Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Slightly less than one minute to ignition, and everything is Go.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, 59:25. And this light will go off at 42.
Time is based on tracking data. Let me know when you start it up.
Okay.
When you feel it, that's when it is.
Okay, this light is out - know any of it any more.
Okay, we're operate - 59:59.
There we go; thrust.
Ignition! Call it at 15.
Ignition. [Pause.]
Okay.
Whew!
We confirm ignition, and the thrust is Go. [Long pause.]
Pressures look good.
Flashes out window number 5.
I'm not sure whether that's - it could be lightning, or it could be something to do with the engine.
Continual flashes [garble].
About 2 degrees off in the pitch [garble].
Yeah, wouldn't worry too much about that.
Apollo 11, this is Houston at 1 minute. Trajectory and guidance look good, and the stage is good. Over.
Apollo 11. Rog.
Don't look out window 1. If you're - if it looks like what I see out window 5, you don't want to look at it [Laughter].
I don't see anything.
Why?
These flashes out here...
Oh, I see a little flashing out there, yes.
You see that? Buzz is usually looking - just watch window 5 for a second. See it?
Yes, yes. Damn, everything's - just kind of sparks flying out there.
Yes, that's - Oopsedo.
Man, that really...
That's PU shift?
I don't know, but it sure put a little blip in there at 2 minutes. I think it increased in thrust.
Think it's the PU shift?
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Thrust is good. Everything's still looking good.
Roger.
That's about like a pitch change rather than an acceleration increase. Did it feel that way to you?
Okay. We got a lighted horizon at 2½ minutes. Pretty horizon.
A fairly smooth ride, you know. It's just a little tiny bit rattly, but nothing like Stafford's. H-dot looks great. Don't bet you could do any better.
I'm sure I couldn't. I'd do worse because I'd be a - a full degree off from where it is right now.
Don't sweat that. 3 minutes.
3 minutes. What we got, about one g, Neil?
Pressures are good...
Yes, we've got 3 feet per second...
Just under one g.
Mike, we're within 3 feet per second on the card H-dot.
Fantastic. And it's shaking everything a little bit.
Shaking at 3 minutes.
Okay.
I hope that camera doesn't fall on your face.
I checked it; it's locked in there pretty well. Won't hurt this visor...
03:30 coming up. Should be 5.5, and it is 5.5.
Nice ride.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Around 3½ minutes, you're still looking good. Your predicted cut-off is right on the nominal.
Roger. Apollo 11's Go.
I see a bright star out there, must be Venus. Forgot to memorize John Mayer's views out the window well enough to say that's Venus or not, but it's sure bright.
What would you do about it?
Nothing.
Four minutes...
Tell you what, that's Venus.
10 feet per second off on H-dot...
[Garble], that's about where it is.
Here comes the old Sun.
Gee, that's going to be bright.
Glad I got my card up.
I'm glad you had - you do too, Neil. That was a good idea, a hell of a good idea. I can't see - well, my tapes are [garble] I can't [garble] see very much.
Coming up on 04:30. How you look, Buzz?
Looks good. Oh, about 14 feet per second right now. The altitude's very good. We ought to get a real good 5-minute cut at the [garble].
You guys agree with my mark; we'll be 5 minutes?
Okay.
Just a second.
Five minutes.
Mark.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. You are Go at 5 minutes.
Roger. We're Go.
Okay, we're just a little bit low on time.
Right on it.
[Garble] yaw.
[Garble] do that?
Yeah, we better do that.
5 - 5 seconds...
What kind of g we pulling?
We got a g 1.2 or 3. 1.3, maybe.
Gee, feels a lot more than that already.
Okay, 6 - okay, about 5 seconds to nominal.
Here we go...
We have cut-off.
3.3 on the Delta...
The Delta-VC on the EMS: 3.3.
Beautiful. EMS Function, Off.
Off.
SECS Pyro Arm, two, Safe.
I got out - I got out of kilter here. Let's go back and let Buzz pick up on it. You're just a little bit ahead of yourself on the checklist.
Okay.
Okay, Houston, you read 11?
Buzz, forget I read anything in the checklist.
Yeah...
Not getting any answer...
Okay, let's go to IU Accept here. Now [garble].
Why don't you try to get up high?
