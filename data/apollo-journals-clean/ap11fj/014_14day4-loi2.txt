We is there.
Okay, I think I got Denebola in sight. Let me look at the - Sure enough, I do. And it's good enough in the telescope. Let me check it through the sextant. It's even in the sextant.
Beautiful! Fantastic!
Let's burn.
That's Manual and Zero - Zero and Manual.
We done paid our debt to society. We done made a star check. 79:50...
It used to be that you couldn't get control on LOI-2; that any burn, any attitude you made was safer than the regular attitude, but that isn't true any more.
Yes.
Okay, we got the Optics, Zero?
Yes, I'm sure it is.
And we're not going to do any Verb 41, Noun 91, any of that stuff...?
No [garble].
...so you can - enter on this one.
Okay. Optics, Zero, Zero, huh?
No!
Supposed to be 0.7.
Oh.
Okay?
Verb 37, Enter. 40, Enter.
How does that look?
Looks beautiful. You enter on it, huh?
No. Leave it there.
Alright.
Align spacecraft roll, GDC Align.
Yes, here we go - [garble] doesn't look bad.
No, I just got through aligning it a little while ago.
Okay, GDC's aligned.
Okay.
Check the circuit breakers.
Alright. I got...
SCS circuit breakers.
SCS; they're all in.
SPS, 12, closed.
SPS, 12 of them.
Att Deadband, Minimum.
Minimum.
Rate, Low?
Rate, Low.
Limit Cycle, On?
On.
Man Att, three, to Rate Command.
Okay, Manual Attitude, three, Rate Command. And - sunrise.
Sunrise's going to be 52:10 - and I missed [garble].
Man Att, three, to Rate Command, you got that?
Three, Rate Command.
BMAG Mode, three of them, to Rate 2.
Three to Rate 2.
Rot Control Power, Direct, two of them, Off.
Off - Off.
SCS TVC, two, to Rate Command.
Two to Rate Command.
TVC Gimbal Drive, Pitch and Yaw, Auto.
Pitch and Yaw, Auto.
Okay, what time do you have?
Okay, we've got - 18 minutes, roughly.
That TVC gimbal drive's taking up the power?
TVC...
Putting out?
...Servo Power?
No. The TVC Gimbal Drive, Pitch and Yaw, to Auto. That didn't do anything, did it?
No. No, that didn't do a thing. Servo power's what takes it.
You know not to leave them on too long.
19 seconds to ullage; two jets.
Okay, 19 seconds, two jets.
A valves only.
Okay.
What did you get out of P30 as far as HA and HP?
I got the right numbers.
65.7, 53.7?
You got these?
Yes. 65.6, 54.6. [Garble] should get those up.
Now, let's see, we can take off the 16-millimeter magazines and the 70-millimeter magazines.
I've got your stopwatch.
Okay, burn time is...
Light the motor.
...17 and 1 second overburn, almost [garble] minutes.
Do it right here.
When's TIG?
11.
80:11:36.
17 seconds - 17 plus 1, huh?
Those little - fluorescent things on there must be from the heat and transfer.
Where are they? On the Command Module?
No.
On the LM?
No.
I don't know, but the Command Module's got about [garble].
Little fluorescent - circles?
There's one of them.
There's some in a lot of failures.
The only thing is all the engineering that went into those damn things, too. There's a lot of time and money down the pipe.
I mean, this big monstrosity out here, it fails...
Hey, we're coming up - You can see the horizon...
See if that looks pretty good - through the sextant and see if that doesn't come up.
Zap.
Sure has been [garble] back here.
Poor old LM is contaminated. It's got urine particles all over it. And, the way the light's shining here, they look yellow. You know, those little - I guess it probably is a little - solid now, the - everything else has boiled off and it's left a little solid.
[Garble], huh?
[garble] solid urine particles are [garble].
I guess.
Wait until the back contam - forward contamination people hear about that.
Yes.
No more urine dumps on the way to the Moon. Put it all in a nice little bag and...
You're not - you've got plenty of black and white film, don't you?
Yes, plenty of black and white film.
[Garble] terminator, 4.
Use as much as you want of anything you want. 80 millimeter, 250, it's all good.
We got 20 minutes until TIG. Oh, excuse me, 10 minutes - 10 minutes until TIG, excuse me. A little over 10. 80:11...
Give me a call at about 7 minutes to go.
Okay, right now...
Mark it.
Yes, siree! That there is rough - rough terrain.
I've got kind of an idea that I'm going to be getting a picture of that - [garble].
[Garble] all those characters back there.
8 minutes until TIG.
Boy, there's a crater right in the side of the wall.
It's a much bigger crater, and I'll be damned if it doesn't look like it just went in sideways.
Okay, 7 minutes. Okay?
[Garble] going to do it...
Buzz, you want to read us that checklist? We'll use my panel chart. Which checklist would you like?
Alright, Main Bus Ties coming On.
Okay. 7 minutes...
Mark.

Oh, I see those current - current [garble] went down on the fuel cells. [Garble] right down here.
The batteries are carrying the...
6 minutes.
About ready for a gimbal motor or two?
Alright. Let's try - Pitch l, Yaw 1.
Here comes Pitch 1...
Mark it.
Got it.
Yaw 1...
Mark it.
Got it.
Okay.

Okay, what numbers do we use?
166 - and let me see - and minus 0.81.
Plus 166 and minus 0.81?
Yes.
Verify MTVC. Okay, there's trim set...
See if we nulled residuals and all that. [Garble]...
MTVC is verified.
...[garble] time on it - what? Okay.
Alright, Translation Controller, Neutral.
Neutral.
Verify GPI returns to zero, zero.
Verified.
ROT Control Power, number 2 - ROT Control Power, Normal, number 2, to AC/DC.
AC/DC.
Spacecraft Control, CMC, verify.
CMC verified. How are the needles, Buzz? Showing up good?
No, we don't need it yet. Alright, BMAG Mode, three of them, to Att 1/Rate 2.
Att 1/Rate 2.
Enter.
Enter.
You got a 204?
Yes.
Spacecraft Control, CMC and Auto, huh?
Yes.
Alright.
And we got 4 minutes until TIG.
Okay, go. Up - down - zero. It really shakes. Up - down - zero.
Which way's it shaking, can you tell? Pitch and yaw?
I don't know; it goes up more on the yaw needle than the pitch needle, but I'm not sure that's indicative of anything except needle sensitivity.
Okay, did it go to [garble]?
Yes, it did. [Garble] Off and the [garble] Off.
Rotation Control Power, Direct, two of them, to Main A/Main B.
Main A/Main B.
SPS Helium Valves, verified Auto. Limit Cycle, Off.
Limit Cycle, Off.
FDAI Scale, 50/15.
Okay.
At 2 minutes, A is coming on - Delta-V Thrust, A.
Okay. And that's - all we use is A. 3 minutes to go.
I like the neat way he's got his - safety belt on - [garble] should be about in the right place.
[Garble] belt for transposition and docking [garble].
Okay, coming up on 2 minutes. I'll get Delta-V Thrust, Normal, A, On, and that's the only bank we'll use.
Delta-V Thrust, Normal, A, is On.
Translation Control.
Armed.
Rotation Control, Armed?
Armed.
Tape Recorder - Command Reset.

EMS Mode, Normal. Stand by for ullage. [Garble].
20, 19...
Ullage.
You got the ullage?
Yes.
Okay. [Garble]?
Yes. Whoops...
You want this [garble]? Alright.
[Garble] and Thrust B.
A?
A, open.
She's holding - she's holding - [garble] looks good.
She's all over.
Okay, stand by for shutdown...
Shutdown!
Shutdown, two valves, closed; two, barber pole.
Okay, Delta-V Thrust, Normal, A, is Off. Stand by for the Gimbal Motors, Off.
Pitch 1, Off...

Verified.
Proceed - and look at these...
[Garble]?
No, we don't need that.
Pretty nice-looking engine. [Garble].
0.3 zero, and zero is [garble].
Alright. Get the EMS Function, Off - How about going Att Deadband, Max?
Okay, we're - we're in DAP control.
Alright, EMS Function, Off. You got the Delta-VC?.
Yes - [garble].
EMS Mode, Stand by.
Okay.

PCM Bit Rate going to Low. ROT Control Power, Direct, two of them, Off.
Off.
Circuit breakers, Pitch 1, Yaw 1, Pitch 2, Yaw 2, Open? Proceed and go to Verb 82. No!
Why not?
That isn't what it says. It says [garble] and go to P00 [garble].
You get this...
...I want to get the circuit breakers...
Up to [garble], and I want to get Average g off, there we go, it's in P00 - Verb 82.
All those listening to the tape, please report that - we need a change in the checklist.
66.1 by 54.4; now you can't beat that.
No, this is about...
That's right downtown.
...this is 65.7...
By 54 point...
We're more elliptic now, huh?
That's about as close as you're going to get.
Yes, I bet we never get circular.
Hey, have you got any more circuit breakers - I mean any more switches for me?
No. When everybody likes this one, why don't you try Verb 83 or a Verb 66 or a - suit yourself. See how much [garble] you put in.
158.
15.8, huh?
158.
Or 158, that's about right. Okay.
Everybody happy with that?
That's reasonable.
Verb 66; want to have a vote on Verb 66?
No!
Everybody in favor of Verb 66 raise their right arm.
Yes, yes.
Okay, check it again. [Garble]. Well, let's see. We didn't gain any on the old PUGS that time. We're still 0.2 behind.
Oh, I suspect you're right. We probably never will.
No. We should have wrapped that thing up during...
Check the increase that time?
Huh?
Did you check the increase that time?
If it increased, it's going to stay increased from now on.
Okay.
But I waited for it to start an upward trend on the first burn.
Understand; that's alright.
Alright - back to the Flight Plan.
[Garble] 33, as I remember it - the right number...
[Garble].
Yes, roll 180, pitch down 81, Orb-rate. God damn, here comes the draft again.
Okay, we're supposed to start charging Battery A.
Charge Battery A, huh?
Let's see what we have; SPS monitor check...
Two breakers out there; two breakers out there - Batt B, Batt B. Batt A, you say - Neil?
Batt A, yes - if you please. Charging Batt A, then on to...
Then roll 180, and then we'll talk about this pitchdown. Alright?
Then you might as well go to your - 293 Inertial, I guess.
Man, that's a gas waster. Soon as I get around here, I'll start it. We'll pass through orb-rate at some point. Takes forever and a day to get around here.
It's going to be a long time before that battery gets back up to 39½ volts.
We done plumb tuckered that one out.
LOI-1 could've got to it, I imagine.
Yes.
Are you going to maintain Orb-rate?
Yes, I guess so. It's going to be sort of a pass through Orb-rate kind of thing because, see if I whip - do it in a hurry, why I got to pitch down 80 degrees, stop the pitch, or stop almost all of it, except for the Orb rate amount. That's going to waste a hell of a lot of gas.
Do we have to do anything - to the O2 to pressurize the LM?
No, we haven't - small enough - Delta-P...
That's 0.9.
0.9?
Yes.
Yes, we have to build up pressure a little bit.
Build up that cabin pressure just a little bit, and I'll start the Direct O2 valve, Open.
It says observe the lunar surface.
That's what it says you ought to - supposed to be doing.
It's brown, it's brown.
Brown all around. There's no doubt which way that - little crater hit.
Here's that same one going by again, Neil, remember? That bright job?
Yes.
Man, there's white stuff all over - and it's black right around the rim.
Hey, well, I'm - while this thing's rolling over, I'm going to take a pee. I'm going to go pee.
180, if you don't mind.
That's a spectacular crater.
Did you shoot some pictures while you were over there?
No, it's just going by - we'd better get it later; there will be better times. If the damn antenna isn't in the way.
Boy, there must be nothing more desolate than to be inside some of these small craters, these conical ones.
People that live in there probably never get out.
Yes, I think you're right. Boy, you can really see the slumping, though. Most of the - You can see where it's all gathered down in the bottom in the corner; you know, on the edge - where a lot of the white stuff has dribbled on down - and evidently it gets covered over after a while with a - a darker layer. There's always a certain amount of the white stuff right in the edges. Pretty characteristic of all of these - white conical ones.
Yes, you know, you can change the color of what you're looking at by moving your head to a different spot in the window - and looking in a different direction.
And that must be big... right down there.
I haven't heard any woo-woo's.
Is there something we should be woo-wooing about?
Wait until we get the VHF on, then we'll hear the woo-wooing.
Okay.
Man, I sure hate to say it based on looking through this monocular, but there's a white spot that's just like a crater - looks like an awful lot under these small fresh ones in the bottom of this rather old crater, but right in the center of it, it looks like instead of there being a crater, looks like it's a rock. [Garble] my eyes deceiving me.
How's our roll doing, Neil?
Oh, you got about 30 degrees to go.
Oh, boy!
Okay.
How far you going to roll?
Over and over.
Got that Direct O2 [garble], didn't you?
Yes, just a tiny bit.
Okay.
It'd be kind of interesting to see some of this dump go on straight from polar orbit. Wonder how long it's going to take before it impacts?
It obviously - is not really in polar orbit if it's going off - going off that way. Yes, it's inclined to the small angle.
Sure looks like it.
It's going straight out there through. That's real funny.
Son of a gun, that one's got a little - little curve on it.
Would you believe that, Neil? One went out and curved around like that. Can you explain that?
I guess it just glanced off another particle or something.
Oh, no, no, no, no; if it's curved.
It had a little bubble in it that came to the surface and went kapoom and...
No...
There's atmospheric drag up here.
...departed it with a little Delta-V.
I think what's really happening is - we're rolling and - it's changing the angle that I'm looking out the window.
Let's see, I want to pitch down 80 degrees to... [garble] 293, down 293, I believe that, I wonder what rate would be reasonable...
Okay, it's about 7 minutes until AOS.
Down 80 degrees in 7 minutes, that's - let's see, about 10 degrees per minute, 10 degrees per minute is...
[Garble] floating up here...
61 [garble].
Well, Mike probably let him out.
Okay, that ought to almost get it there and, damn, I don't want to see any more than that.
You can open the battery [garble] pad.
That ought to be enough.
[Garble].
Alright, where are we? We're pitching down. Gee, it's too bad we can't stop right here and observe the Earth come up. You know, we ought to get that picture one time.
We probably can do it. You could stop it right here if you wanted to spend the gas.
Yes. That's the only trouble, the doggone gas. What are you on?
A picture looking out over the LM as well.
Yes.
Shouldn't be a bad picture. Why don't we stop it?
Okay.
We ought to be able to get High Gain from this attitude, shouldn't we?
Think we ought to get the long lens on, Mike?
Yes, we ought to get the 250 - we ought to do it at 250.
You've got 4 minutes; that's plenty. Now, we're going to want to...
Are we at a good enough attitude? I hope so. We are out this window, babe, but we're not out that one. If the Earth is right there, that's where it's coming up, huh? Better be.
You want color?
Ah...
We better have color.
Yes, we want color.
I got a clean window over here so don't sweat that one too much.
250 - hand me your camera, Neil, and I'll change it.
Who's got the Hasselblad?
Probably over there on the shelf.
We got it. First quad is in - back is...
That wall of that crater looks pasty through the sextant. Great big chunks of white stuff that just slumped down.
Did you get - [garble]? If you get too far over here, we may have to watch our pitch angle. We're good right now.
[Garble].
Orb-rate...
No, we're not Orb-rate.
The Earth's going to be coming Orb-rate at us.
[Garble].
Okay. Let's see, I've got to pitch up a tad then [garble].
Okay, I've still got f:8 and [garble].
250th at f:8, I think we can do it, and infinity.
I don't know. What's the matter with where you had it?
Oh, son of a gun! [Laughter.] We're going backwards. Oh, well.
Oh dear. Dummkopf!
That's it, I think, there, Neil - so pitch down.
Prior planning prevents poor performance.
Thank you. Is that right, Buzz?
All that - Where'd you ever hear that one, Buzz?
I can't think.
Oh, that's a bright one. I got to get that one [garble].
No lie!
150 - you don't want to take too many on this.
No. Might as well put the other one back on.
Well, you might save that for some Earth shots.
Wow!
[Garble].
You got it, huh?
I think it focused the second one a little bit better. I think it's beautiful. Just fabulous. Not really sure what you're looking at - but there's some mighty big fresh rocks down in that crater.
The walls actually look pock-marked. Sure enough, and they're not filled in. Pock-marked, and it looks like somebody's painted white paint vertically down the edges and then it's been eaten away.
[Garble] that one [garble] into the LM.
Here is the Earth. Hey, I got the view over here.
I guess I'd better get the High Gain off, hadn't I?
Did it just come up?
Yes.
We need that [garble].
Do we still got High Gain?
Yes.
It's says minus 67 and zero.
Minus 67 and zero.
And zero.
Okay, Manual - and - Auto - medium. There we go. Can't make up his mind between zero and - 360. Okay, we got them.
Okay.
