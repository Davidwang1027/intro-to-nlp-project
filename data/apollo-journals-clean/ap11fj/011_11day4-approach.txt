Houston, Apollo 11.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Goddard voice, Houston Comm Tech. GOSS conference.
You're loud and clear, how me?
Roger. Read you the same.
Roger.
Madrid, Houston Comm Tech. Net 1, voice check.
Houston Comm Tech, Madrid. I read you loud and clear.
Roger. Read you loud and clear also.
Hello, Houston. Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, Houston. Good morning.
Good morning. Are you planning a Midcourse Correction 4 this morning?
That's negative. Midcourse number 4 is not required. We were going to let you sleep in until about 71 hours if you'd like to turn over.
Okay. That'll be fine. We'll.
Say again, Buzz. You were cut out there.
Okay. I'll see you at 71 hours.
He he, Roger.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Good morning again, Houston. Apollo 11.
Roger 11. Good morning. When you...
Would you like the O2 purge this morning?
Yes indeed. O2 fuel cell purge at 71 hours, and when you feel like copying, I've got a Flight Plan update containing - I guess that and some other items for you.
Okay. Stand by.
Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead with the Flight Plan update.
Roger, 11. This is Houston. At approximately 71 hours to 72 hours, we have you down for an eat period which I imagine is probably in progress already. 71 hours: O2 fuel cell purge. 72 hours GET: CO2 filter change number 6, secondary radiator flow check, and we'll send you up a P37 block data on a 2-hour pass - pericynthion pass return mode abort. At 73 hours, 00 minutes, stop PTC at approximately 0 degrees roll, that is when you're coming up on 0 degrees roll angle around 73 hours we'd like you to stop PTC. And perform a P52 option 3 remaining in the PTC REFSMMAT for a drift check. 73 hours, 20 minutes, we'll give you a P27 update to the landing site REFSMMAT, LOI-1 state vector and target load. 73 hours, 30 minutes; maneuver to 000 roll, pitch, and yaw. High Gain Antenna angles will be pitch 0, yaw 335; and perform a P52 option 1 using the new landing site REFSMMAT. Resume the nominal Flight Plan at 74 hours GET. Over.
Okay. We'll get started on the fuel cell purge while we're eating. CO2 canister change number 6; secondary radiator flow check; copy some PADs. Also at 72 hours, stop PTC 0 roll. At 73; do a P52 option 3; we'll get your uplink REFSMMAT for the landing site; and - and at 000 degrees, now was this with the old REFSMMAT or the new REFSMMAT?
This is with the...
antenna and, pitch.
This is with the new REFSMMAT, Buzz.
Okay. You want the P52 done at that attitude with the new REFSMMAT?
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, go ahead.
Roger, 11. Correction on my last. At 73:20, we uplink you the new REFSMMAT. And at 73:30, we'd like you to maneuver to 0 roll, 0 pitch, 0 yaw in the old REFSMMAT. And then torque around to the new REFSMMAT and run your P52 option 1 in that same inertial attitude. Over.
Roger, understand.
And I've got a consumables update, when you're ready to copy.
I just got up, but you didn't catch me on that one.
I say, I have one for you.
Okay. We're ready to copy that consumable update.
Roger. As of GET 68:00; RCS total, minus 4.5 percent, corresponding to approximately minus 53 pounds. Alpha, minus 6.0 percent, minus 1.0 percent, minus 7.0 percent, minus 3.0 percent; H2 total, minus 1.2 pounds; O2 total, plus 10 pounds. Over.
Roger. And our readouts on board are Alpha is 82, Bravo is 84, Cocoa is 84, and Delta is 87.
Houston. Roger. Out.
And you want us to cycle the O2 and H2 fans, I imagine?
11, this is Houston. Affirmative. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. I have a status report for you.
Go ahead, 11.
Roger. On sleep, CDR, CMP 7.5, LMP 6.5. Over.
Roger. 7.5 for each. Over.
Negative. LMP 6.5.
Roger. 7.5, 7.5 and 6.5. And I got a few words for you here on the SPS engine performance. Over.
Okay. We're ready to listen.
Okay, 11. It turns out that the engine performance during both of your burns so far this mission has been the same as it was on engine acceptance tests. The onboard PC reading is due to a known gauge calibration factor between what you've actually got in the chamber and what you're reading out on the gauge. We expect single-bank operation to be 90 - that is, 90 psi on the gauge with an actual chamber pressure of 95 psi. In dual-bank operation, the chamber pressure is 94 psi on the gauge with an actual of 99 psi. 80 psi on the gauge on board correlates to 83 psi actual. And we recommend that you stick to an LOI termination cue of 80 psi on the gauge. That is, no change to the mission rules. Over.
Apollo 11. Roger. We got all that.
Houston. Out.
Houston. Apollo 11..
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
Houston, do you read Apollo 11?
Roger, 11. We're reading you loud and clear now. We were down in the noise as we switched antennas a minute or so ago. Over.
Roger. What sort of settings could you recommend for that solar corona? We've got the Sun right behind the edge of the Moon now.
Roger.
It's quite an eerie sight. There is a very marked three-dimensional aspect of having the Sun's corona coming from behind the Moon the way it is.
Roger.
And it looks as though - I guess what's giving it that three-dimensional effect, the Earthshine. I can see Tycho fairly clearly - at least if I'm right side-up, I believe it's Tycho, in Moonshine - I mean, in Earthshine. And, of course, I can see the sky is lit all the way around the Moon, even on the limb of it where there's no Earthshine or sunshine.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. If you'd like to take some pictures, we recommend using magazine Uniform which is loaded with high speed black and white film, interior lights off, electric Hasselblad with the 80-millimeter lens. And you're going to have to hand-hold this, I guess. We're recommending an f-stop of 2.8, and we'd like to get a sequence of time exposures. Over.
Okay. You want magazine Uniform instead of magazine Tango? Over.
Roger. We're not trying to get you all wrapped up in a procedure here. This is on a not-to-interfere basis, of course. Over.
Okay.
And on the exposures we're looking for an eighth of a second, a half a second. And, if you think you can steady the camera against anything to get longer exposures, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and 8 seconds. Over.
Roger. We copy.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We'd like to do a little cryo tank balancing. So, if you could position the Oxygen Tank number 1 heater switch to Off and Hydrogen Tank 2 heater switch to Off, leaving all the rest of the cryo switches the same, we'll let it run that way for a few hours. Over.
Okay. Stand by one, on those switches. We'll get them in a minute.
Roger. And how far out can you see the corona extending? Over.
Well, its a bit like zodiacal light. It keeps going out farther and farther. We'll talk about it a little more later.
Roger. Out.
We've got quite a few pictures windows corresponding.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. I think we have Comm again. We heard you calling. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Were you calling? Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Understand you want the heaters Off for Hydrogen Tank 1 and Oxygen Tank 1. Is that affirmative?
That's negative, Mike. Hydrogen Tank number 2 heaters, Off, and Oxygen Tank number 1 heaters, Off.
Okay.
Roger. Out.
I have Hydrogen Tank number 2 heaters, Off. I have Oxygen Tank number 1 heaters, Off.
Roger. Out.
Houston. Apollo 11. The Earthshine coming through the window is so bright you can read a book by it.
Oh, very good.
And, Houston, I'd suggest that along the ecliptic line we can see corona light out to two lunar diameters from this location. The bright light only extends out about an eighth to a quarter of the lunar radius.
Roger. Understand that you can see the corona approximately 200 solar diameters out along the ecliptic, and the bright light extends out approximately one-eighth to one-quarter lunar radius. Over.
That's two lunar - two lunar diameters along the ecliptic in the bright part - right - a quarter to an eighth of a lunar radius out, and that's perpendicular to the ecliptic line on the South Pole.
Roger.
Houston, it's been a real change for us. Now we're able to see stars again and recognize constellations for the first time on the trip. It's - the sky is full of stars. Just like the night side of Earth. But all the way here, we've only been able to see stars occasionally and perhaps through the monocular, but not recognize any star patterns.
I guess it's turned into night up there really, hasn't it?
Really has.
11, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
Okay. We went to the High Gain. Looks like you had a little trouble getting signal strength there.
Roger. We missed an Omni switch there. Over.
All right. On the secondary loop check when we went to Flow on the secondary radiators, the quantity dropped from 40 percent down to 36 in the first 10 seconds and then stabilized at 36 for the remainder of the 30 seconds.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We believe that's normal system operation. The radiators are expected to be very cold right now and apparently the decrease you saw was due to contraction in the fluid. Over.
Okay. We'll go ahead with the procedure just as if there were no decrease in accumulator quantity. Right?
Roger. Press on.
And, Houston, the secondary radiator flow check is complete and satisfactory.
Houston. Roger. Out.
And that's a good deal because we don't have to have any meetings about whether we're going to do it or don't do it any more.
That's for sure.
The Flight Director says 'ouch!'
No. No 'ouch' intended. I enjoyed every one of those meetings.
11, this is Houston. I have your pericynthion-plus-2 PAD, P30 format, when you're ready to copy.
Roger. Stand by.
Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy pericynthion-plus-2.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Pericynthion-plus-2 hours PAD. SPS/G&N: 62710, plus 0.98, minus 0.19; GET ignition 077:46:22.48, Delta-VX Noun 81, plus 3214.8, minus 0045.5, minus 1037.7; roll NA, pitch 307, and the remainder of the PAD is NA. GDC align stars; Vega and Deneb. Roll 243, 183, 012; no ullage. Remarks: Assumes landing site REFSMMAT and docked. Over.
Roger. SPS/G&N: 62710, plus 0.98, minus 0.19; 077:46:22.48; plus 3214.8, minus 0045.5, minus 1037.7; NA, 307; Vega and Deneb; 243, 183, 012; no ullage. Landing site REFSMMAT, docked. And ya'aven't - change on the LM weight. Over.
No change in the LM's weight - in the LM weight, and the readback is correct. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. We're having difficulty getting commands into the spacecraft. We'd like you to cycle your Up Telemetry switch to Command Reset and Off and then back to Normal. Over.
Okay. We'll do it.
We have you on High Gain right now. You want us to switch over to Omni?
Negative. We'd like to stay on the High Gain if we can. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. We'd like you to switch to Omni Delta as we show you approximately at the scan limit of the High Gain Antenna. We will then command Omni Delta down here after you advise us you've switched, and then you can select Bravo on board and we'll be back in the Omni antenna commanding business. Over.
Okay. We're going to Delta now.
11, Houston. You can go ahead and select Omni Bravo on board now.
You have it.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you have a minute or so free, we can read you up the morning news here.
Go right ahead, let's hear it.
Roger. Hot from the wires of the MSC Public Affairs Office, especially prepared for the crew of Apollo 11.
Okay. First off, looks like it's going to be impossible to get away from the fact that you guys are dominating all the news back here on Earth. Even Pravda in Russia is headlining the mission and calls Neil, the Czar of the Ship. I think maybe they got the wrong mission.
West Germany has declared Monday to be Apollo Day. School children in Bavaria have been given the day off. Post Office clerks have been encouraged to bring radios to work and Frankfurt is installing TV sets in public places.
BBC in London is considering a special radio alarm system to call people to their TV sets in case there is a change in the EVA time on the Moon.
And in Italy, Pope Paul VI has arranged for a special color TV circuit at his summer residence in order to watch you, even though Italian television is still black and white.
Back here in Houston, your three wives and children got together for lunch yesterday at Buzz's house. And according to Pat, it turned out to be a gab-fest. The children swam and did some high jumping over Buzz's bamboo pole.
In Moscow, space engineer Anatol Koritsky was quoted by TASS as saying that Luna 15 could accomplish everything that had been done by earlier Luna spacecraft. This was taken by the press to mean Luna 15 could investigate the gravitational field, photograph the Moon, and go down to the surface to scoop up a bit for analysis.
Even the kids at camp got in the news when Mike Junior was quoted as replying 'yeah' when somebody asked him if his daddy was going to be in history. Then after a short pause he asked: 'What is history?' In Washington, President Nixon is planning to use his executive power to streamline the Interstate Commerce Commission. According to the industry sources, it was reported Nixon would trim the commission from 11 to 7 members by not making new appointments.
And the big news around Houston today concerns the Astros. In the sports world, the Houston Astros rallied in the ninth inning at Cincinnati to dump the Reds 7 to 4. Going into the ninth however, things looked pretty bleak: the Astros were trailing 4 to 3. Then with one out, Jesus Alou stroked a single to right field. John Edwards hit another single to right, and Sandy Valdespino hit a double to bring in the tying run. Julio Gotay was walked and Joe Morgan dropped a bunt for the game-winning play. A wild throw to the plate allowed another run to score, then a sacrifice fly by Dennis Menke brought in the final run. They really came through in the ninth.
And other games in the National League...
Yes. Those Astros have really been catching those flies since they put a roof on the stadium.
Good work.
In other games in the National League, New York beat Montreal 5 to 2; Pittsburgh beat St. Louis 4 to 1; and Atlanta over San Diego in the first game of a double header, 6 to 2.
In the American League, Detroit beat Cleveland 4 to nothing; New York trounced Washington 5 to nothing; Baltimore out hit - Boston out hit Baltimore to score 6 runs to the Orioles' 2; and Chicago beat Kansas City 6 to 1.
Okay. In golf world, Tommy Jacobs, an infrequent competitor in recent years, took the lead in the Philadelphia Golf Classic yesterday. His second round score was 139.
You might be interested in knowing, since you are already on the way, that a Houston astrologer, Ruby Graham, says that all the signs are right for your trip to the Moon. She says that Neil is clever, Mike has good judgment, and Buzz can work out intricate problems. She also says Neil tends to see the world through rose-colored glasses, but he is always ready to help the afflicted or distressed. Neil, you are also supposed to have, quote, intuition that enables you to interpret life with feeling, unquote. Buzz is to be very sociable and cannot bear to be alone in addition to having excellent critical ability. Since she didn't know at what hour Mike was born, she has decided that he either has the same attributes as Neil or he is inventive with an unconventional attitude that might seem eccentric to the unimaginative.
And last but not...
Who said all that?
Ruby Graham, an astrologer here in Houston. Now we check with Flight Operations for all the signs for the mission, and then we, of course, had to make sure that everything was really all set.
Houston, 11. You're cutting out.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. We're switching Omnis. Can you stand by for about 2 minutes?
Houston, 11. Radio check.
11, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. You cut out after Tommy Jacobs and I guess we got into antenna switching problems.
Okay. Following Tommy Jacobs, we have the hot smoking word from a local Houston astrologer by the name of Ruby Graham. She says that all the signs are right for your trip to the Moon. Neil is clever, Mike has good judgement, and Buzz can work out intricate problems. She also says Neil tends to see the world through rose-colored glasses but is always ready to help the afflicted or distressed. Neil, you are also supposed to have, quote, intuition that enables you to interpret life with feeling, unquote. Buzz is supposed to be very sociable and cannot bear to be alone in addition to having excellent critical ability. Since she didn't know at what hour Mike was born, she's decided he either has the same attributes as Neil or that he is inventive with an unconventional attitude that might seem eccentric to the unimaginative. And that's 30 for today. Over.
Thank you much there, Bruce and Fred Show, we appreciate that.
Roger.
Did you hear our comment about the Astros?
The one about the roof?
Yep.
Hey, Mike, the game was at Cincinnati there, and we think that they're still using Crosby Field up there. I don't believe it has a roof on it.
You got him on that one.
Right...
I think they're just getting to be a good team in the clinch.
They certainly seem to be.
Well, if they can do that well without a roof, think of what they're going to do with a roof.
Roger. Out.
They're trying.
An old Oiler fan is trying to comment on an alien game.
You tell Michael Junior, history or no history, he'd better behave himself.
Roger. We'll pass that along, Mike.
Apollo 11, Houston. If it's convenient with you, we have an LOI-1 PAD that we can pass up to you now. Over.
Stand by.
Houston, Apollo 11. The next time we pass through roll 0, we're going to stop PTC and that'll give us 90 degrees pitch. Now, I understand you want us to move from 90 degrees pitch to 0 degrees pitch for the platform align, option 1. Is that affirmative?
Standby, please.
And we're ready to copy on the LOI-1.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. When you stop at 0 roll, you'll be in approximately 90 pitch, 0 yaw, and 0 roll. We'd like you to run the first P52, that is, the P52 option 3, from that attitude. Then we'll uplink you a new REFSMMAT, either before or while you're maneuvering to 000, then you can torque the platform around and run the second REFSMMAT. Over. Run the second P52. Over.
Okay.
And I copied you're ready for the LOI-1 PAD. Over.
Go ahead.
LOI-1, SPS/G&N: 62710, plus 0.98, minus 0.19, GET ignition 075:49:49.65; minus 2889.7, minus 0394.4, minus 0068.6; roll 358, pitch 226, 347; 0169.2, plus 00610; 2917.3, 6:02, 2910.8; sextant star 31, 1066, 358. Remainder of the PAD is NA. GDC align, Vega and Deneb, 243, 183, 012. No ullage. The horizon will be visible just below the upper edge of the hatch window 2 minutes prior to the LOI burn. It will not be visible in the rendezvous window on the left-hand side. LOS at 75 hours, 41 minutes, 23 seconds. AOS at 76:15:29. AOS without the LOI burn, 76:05:30. The values which you would see on Noun 42 prior to LOI burn are HA, plus 431.3; HP, minus 128.2. Read back, over.
Roger. LOI-1, SPS/G&N: 62710, plus 0.98, minus 0.19; 075:49:49.65; minus 2889.7, minus 0394.4, minus 0068.6; 358, 226, 347; 0169.2, plus 0061.0; 2917.3, 6:02, 2910.8; 31, 106.6, 35.8. GDC align, Vega and Deneb, 243, 183, 012. No ullage. Horizon in the hatch window 2 minutes before TIG. AOS with an LOI, 76:15:29; AOS without an LOI, 76:05:30. HA before the burn, 431.3; HP, minus 128.2. Say again LOS time.
Roger. LOS time 75:41:23. Over.
Understand 75:41:23.
11, this is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. Apparently we missed getting your onboard readouts on battery Charlie and Pyro batteries Alpha and Bravo last night. I wonder if you could give us some fresh numbers. Over.
You want the readings now?
Yes, please. If it's convenient for you.
Okay. All three of the them are still 37.1.
Roger. 37.1 cubed. Out.
Houston, Apollo 11. The P52 option 3 is complete. We're maneuvering to 000.
Roger. We observe your maneuvering, and we'll have some uplinks for you in a couple of minutes here.
Okay.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We observe you're in P00. If you'll give us Accept, we'll start our uplinks.
You got it, Houston.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We're on low bit rate at the present time so it's going to take us a little bit longer than normal to get this stuff up to you. Over.
I guess we're in no rush.
Okay. We're here, if you're there.
The view of the Moon that we've been having recently is really spectacular. It fills about three-quarters of the hatch window, and of course, we can see the entire circumference, even though part of it is in complete shadow and part of it's in Earthshine. It's a view worth the price of the trip.
Well, there are a lot of us down here that would be willing to come along.
I hope you get your turn, and soon.
One of these days, we'll be able to bring the whole MOCR along, I hope. Save a lot of antenna switching.
Say again, 11.
One of these days, we could bring the whole MOCR along, and then that'll save a lot of antenna switching.
That's jolly.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
11, this is Houston. We're showing you...
The Czar is brushing his teeth, so I'm filling in for him.
Say again, please.
I said the Czar is brushing his teeth, so I'm filling in for him. What can we do for you?
Roger. Well, if you don't get in the way of the Czar while he's brushing his teeth, we'd like you to bring up the primary accumulator quantity a little bit. We're showing the quantity now at 20.6 percent on TM. Seems to have gone down a bit since you've gone into the shadow. We'd like it serviced to bring the quantity up to between 30 and 40 percent, preferably 35 percent. Over.
Okay.
The computer is yours, 11. The loads are in and verified. You can go back to Block.
We're in Block.
11, this is Houston. On the basis of your last P52 alignment, the platform looks like it's indeed performing very well. No problems there, no updates required, and no PIPA bias update is required either. Over.
Sounds good.
Houston, Apollo 11. Radio check.
11, this is Houston. Loud and clear. Over.
Okay. Just checking. Do you want the High Gain?
Roger. If you can give it to us.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read on the High Gain?
Loud and clear on the High Gain.
Same here. We've completed the P52 option 1.
Roger. We've been looking over your shoulder by TM.
Glad to have you.
Houston, Apollo 11. Standing by to copy TEI-1 and TEI-4. Over.
Roger. I've got the 1 and 4 PADs here, right now. I'll be ready to read them up to you in just a second.
11, this is Houston. I'm ready with the TEI-1 and 4 PADs. Over.
Ready to copy.
Roger. TEI-1, SPS/G&N; 38658, minus 0.54, plus 0.65, TIG, 078:02:03.45; plus 2918.0, plus 0377.9, minus 0132.5; roll NA, pitch 041. The balance of the PAD is NA. Ullage; two jets, 19 seconds. TEI-4 PAD, SPS/G&N:, 38658, minus 0.54, plus 0.65, TIG, 084:29:50.59; plus 3137.3, plus 0376.0, minus 0096.8; roll NA, pitch 034. The rest of the PAD is NA. Ullage; two jets, 19 seconds. Both of these PADs are for an undocked maneuver. TEI-plus-4 PAD assumes no LOI-2. Over. Make that TEI-4 PAD assumes no LOI-2.
Roger. TEI-1, SPS/G&N; 38658, minus 0.54, plus 0.65; 078:02:03.45; plus 2918.0, plus 0377.9, minus 0132.5; roll NA, pitch 041; two jets, 19 seconds; undocked. TEI-4: 38658, minus 0.54, plus 0.65, 084:29:50.59, plus 3137.3, plus 0376.0, minus 0096.8; roll NA, pitch 034; two jets, 19 seconds; undocked; assumes no LOI-2.
11, this is Houston...
Apollo 11. Over.
11, this is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. At GET of 74:30, we'd like you to cycle the fans in all four Cryo tanks and position the heaters in all four Cryo tanks to the Auto position. We're doing this in advance of LOI in order to ensure that you don't have any destratification as a result of the burn, which might result in giving you a master Caution and Warning during the burn. Over.
Okay. Was that 74:30 you want us to cycle the heaters and turn - cycle the fans and turn all the heaters on?
All the heaters to Auto; cycle the fans at 74:30, about 25 minutes from now. Over.
Okay.
11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Houston, 11.
Roger. Loud and clear now.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11.
Apparently this is not a very good Omni attitude for you. We're ready to start our TVC check.
11, this is Houston. We're ready, except that we'd like to get the High Gain Antenna prior to this test. Over.
Can you give us a couple of pointing angles?
Roger. From an attitude with 60 degrees roll, around to an attitude of roll 058 inertial. It would be pitch plus 30 and yaw 270 on the High Gain Antenna.
Thank you.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger. We're reading you weak but clear.
Roger. We put our - our roll for MSFN track in on the wrong sign. Going to continue rolling around until we get High Gain here. And, we'll delete the - the pitch that was scheduled after the TVC check.
Say again please, 11.
Roger. We put the wrong sign in...
Roger.
for the roll correction to get MSFN High Gain, and we're continuing rolling around to get the proper attitude for High Gain at this time. We will delete the pitch maneuver that was scheduled subsequent to - subsequent to the TV check since we already have those pictures.
Roger. We copy. And and we recommend that you go ahead and complete your TVC test on board. If you have problems, we'll talk to you when you get around further into the High Gain Antenna attitude. Over.
Roger.
Houston, how do you read on High Gain?
Oh, loud and clear on High Gain, 11.
Roger. We're proceeding.
Roger.
