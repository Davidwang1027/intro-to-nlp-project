Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
Roger, Buzz. The attitude that we're in right now is a convenient one to start PTC in. We'd be satisfied with this attitude. So we'd like you to disable quads Charlie and Delta; and we'll wait about 5 to 10 minutes, and then we'll establish the PTC. Over.
Roger. Disable Charlie and Delta, and we'll wait before starting PTC.
Rog.
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. The rates are damped out well enough for you to initiate the PTC now. Over.
Okay. We'll get it going.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. This time the DAP didn't like 0.3. It's - We followed the procedures; we got down to 70000 Enter. It took off at about 0.7.
Roger. We're copying that. Stand by.
Houston, Apollo 11. Would you like high gain back?
Roger. And you - Would you select Attitude Hold? Over.
Houston. Would you say again what your request is?
Roger, 11. We'd like you to go back to Attitude Hold. Over.
Roger.
11, Houston. Looks like we're going to have to reinitialate - reinitialize this PTC.
Alright.
Okay. Do you have any roll angle that you'd like to stop it in, Charlie? I haven't stopped it yet.
Stand by.
11, Houston. It's your preference right now if you want to. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Roger, 11. The problem on that initial starting up the PTC was we failed to do the Verb 49 which - and load the desired initial attitude; so the DAP tried to take it back to the old attitude that we had started up in number of hours to go. That's why we picked up the rates in the other axes. We're going to wait in this attitude for about 20 minutes to damp out the rates again, and then we'll proceed with the Verb 49 and load our attitude that we have at the time - at this time. Over.
Okay. It sounds good, Charlie. When you get to the Verb 49, I'd like for you to give me the three gimbal angles that you want loaded.
Roger. We'll do. Over.
Thank you.
And Apollo 11, Houston. We have your fly-by PAD if you're ready to copy. Over.
Stand by one.
Houston, Apollo 11. Is that P30 PAD?
That's affirmative. Over.
Okay. Ready to copy.
All right, Buzz. It's - fly-by is the purpose. SPS/G&N: 62815, plus 0.97, minus 0.20; 070:54:59.44; minus 0002.8, plus 0002.3, plus 0006.9; 029, 149, 312; apogee is NA, plus 0022.1; 0007.8, 0:01, 0003.4; sextant star, 01, 218.5, 22.7; boresight star is NA, NA, NA. Latitude is minus 02.65, minus 165.00; 1189.9, 36228, 144:56:47. In the comments: your set stars are Deneb and Vega, 007, 144, 068. No ullage. It's a docked burn using the PTC REFSMMAT. Stand by for your read-back. Over.
Okay. Would you give me GET of 0.05g again, please?
Roger. 144:56:47. Over.
Roger. Flyby SPS/G&N: 62815, plus 0.97, minus 0.20; 070:54:59.44; minus 0002.8, plus 0002.3, plus 0006.9; 269, 149, 312; NA, plus 0022.1; 0007.8, 0:01, 0003.4; 01, 218.5, 22.7; NA; minus 02.65, minus 165.00; 1189.9, 36228, 144:56:47; Deneb and Vega; 007, 144, 068. No ullage; docked, PTC REFSMMAT. Over.
Roger. Say again your roll angle, Buzz. I copy - I read 029. Over.
Roger. 029.
Roger. Good readback.
Houston, Apollo 11. On the seven-tenths rate, the rate loaded into the DAP is one or two tenths.
11, Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Go.
Roger, Mike. Would you please copy down your Verb 16 Noun 20 ICDU angles now, then execute a Verb 49 and load that - those angles, the Noun 20 that you see on the DSKY into the Verb - into the Noun 22 slot; and Pro on that, and that will start our 20-minute rate period. Over.
Okay, Charlie. I'll do that right now, and just a matter of interest, those numbers are plus 04511, plus 09021, and plus 35984. Over.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. I've done that and, of course, I got an immediate 50 18, so I guess we're set up to proceed from here, and I'll start the 20-minute timer.
That's affirmative.
Houston. I still question that seven-tenths rate with two-tenths loaded into the DAP, though. Could you explain that one?
Roger. We're working on it. Standby one.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Roger. We got a little laser visual experiment we'd like to - for you to do for us. If you - if you got the Earth through any of your windows or through the telescope, would you so advise? Over.
Standby one, Charlie.
At this roll attitude, what should our High Gain angles be? Maybe that would help us locate you. We don't see you because of the LM.
Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Those High Gain angles are pitch minus 70, yaw 90. We think the Earth is apparently pretty close to plus Z-axis. Over.
Okay.
Okay, Charlie. I got you in the telescope.
Roger, Apollo 11. We've got a laser that we're going to - It's a blue-green laser that we're going to flash on and off at a frequency of on for a second, off for a second. It's coming out of McDonald Observatory near El Paso, which is - should be right on the terminator - or right inside the terminator. We are going to activate that momentarily. Would you please take a look through the telescope and see if you can see it. Over.
Telescope or sextant?
Either one. Over.
Okay, I'll try it with the telescope; and if I don't see it there, then I'll try the sextant.
Roger. We'll give you the word when they've got it turned on. Over.
Okay.
11, Houston. They don't have it turned on yet. We'll give you the word when they got it turned on. Over.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We noticed the Cryo pressure dropped a moment ago. Did you stir up the Cryos? Over.
Roger. We've finished our cycling operations.
Rog. Copy. Out.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. McDonald's got the laser turned on. Would you take a look? Over.
Okay, Charlie.
It's bluish-green.
11, Houston. We got some shaft and trunnion for you that might tweak it up a little bit. Shaft of 141.5, trunnion of 39.5. Over.
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. If you see it, it should be coming up - appear to be coming up, through the clouds. McDonald reports that there's a break in the clouds that they're beaming this thing through. Over.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can terminate the exercise on the laser. Our rates are steady enough now for to commence the PTC. Over.
Okay, Houston. Neither Neil nor Mike can see it. Incidentally, those shafts and trunnions just missed pointing at the world.
Roger. Thank you.
As we are looking at it through the scanning telescope, it would be about a - oh, maybe a third of an Earth radii high and to the left.
Roger.
But, we did - but we did identify the El Paso area and it appeared to us to be a break in the clouds there, and we looked in that break and saw nothing.
Roger. Thank you much. Out.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Roger. Go ahead. Over.
Were you following that on the DSKY?
Roger. Stand by.
11, Houston. What's your exact question? Over.
I've followed the procedure through step 7 down to the point where I've got 27303 Enter, and this resulted in an Operator Error light.
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. Stand by a moment. We'll have an answer for you momentarily. Over.
Okay. Appreciate it, Charlie. Now the light's gone out without any further DSKY action.
Roger.
Correction. Stand by, that's not so.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Roger. We've finally gotten concurrence on our problem here with 50 guys looking at it. When we were sitting in the 50 18, we attempted to load the erasable before you terminated the Verb 49. So, Mike, what we're going to have to do is call up the present CDUs, copy those down, and do a Verb 49, load the present, then do a Proceed, then an Enter, and then we can then set up Attitude Hold in step 6. Over.
Okay. I think that's what we did last time.
It appeared to us that we attempted to load the erasable prior to entering on the Verb 49 which Verb 49 was still running, and it clobbered the CDUs. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. We're moving at the proper rate.
Hallelujah!
11, Houston. It looks great to us now. Over.
It looks fine here, Charlie. The seven-tenths part is the only part I don't find explained yet.
Roger, Mike. We're working on that one right now. We're coming up with a story soon. Over.
Thank you.
11, Houston. We're handing over comm to Goldst - Correction, from Goldstone to Honeysuckle. Over.
Okay.
Hello, Houston through Honeysuckle. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Go ahead. Over.
You sound good to us through Honeysuckle. How do we sound?
Roger. You're five-by, Mike. We'd like the Omni configuration as follows. Omni Alpha, place in Bravo; Omni to Omni, High Gain track to Manual, High Gain yaw 270, pitch...
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. How do you read now? Over.
Roger. I'm reading you loud and clear. I'm not sure I got all those. I've got S-band Omni B, Omni, track to Manual, and beam wide, pitch - you'd better say that again, and yaw 270. Over.
Roger, Buzz. I broke up at pitch minus 50 at beam wide. Over.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, Apollo 11. Are you ready to copy some numbers on status report, et cetera.
Say again. Over.
Roger. Are you ready to copy some numbers on the status report, et cetera?
Rog. Go ahead. Over.
Okay. Radiation: CDR, 11005; CMP, 10006; LMP, 09007. Medication negative. And I got some battery and RCS numbers for you.
Go ahead. Over.
Battery C, 37.1; Pyro battery A and B, both 37.1. RCS Alpha, 82; Bravo, 84; Cocoa, 85; Delta, 87. Over.
Roger, we copy. Radiation 11005, 10006, 09007; no medication; 37.1, 37.1, 37.1, 82, 84, 85, 87. Over.
That's affirmative. And you want a LM/CM Delta-P? It's 1.1.
Roger. Copy 1.1.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Please verify that four Cryo heaters, Auto; the four fans, Off. Over.
Okay. We've been holding the O2 heater number 1 in the Off position. I believe that was your last instruction. All the other heaters are Auto and all fans are Off. Over.
Roger. Stand by.
11, Houston. We'd like all heaters, Auto. Over.
Roger. All four Auto, all four fans Off.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. As the Sun sinks slowly in the west, the White Team bids you good night. If we get a story on the seven-tenths, we can give it to you in about 15 minutes or so; if not, we'll give it to you in the morning. Over.
Okay. That sounds fine, Charlie. Thanks very much.
Hey, you earned your pay today, Charlie. Thank you.
Rog. Good night all.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. One request: the optics switch to zero. And we've got a lot of theories on why it maneuvered at seven-tenths a moment ago, Mike, but no real definite answer. We'll be back with you later. Over.
Okay. No rush, Charlie. Thank you.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Roger. Mike, I think we can explain that seven-tenths rate. When we - the first time through, you know, we failed to go through the Verb 49, so we had a large error between our actual CDU and desired CDU in roll. And with that situation, the DAP - the vehicle will roll - will maneuver, rather, at a rate that is loaded in, which was three-tenths plus four-tenths rate, and it will limit at four-tenths above the desired rate, so - that is if we have a large enough angle between the desired and the actual, which we did. So, therefore, the rate was four-tenths plus three-tenths to give you the seven-tenths. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger.
