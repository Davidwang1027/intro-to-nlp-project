Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
Rog. We have our updated state vector out there for you. Request P00 and Accept. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. You've got it.
Okay. Here it comes.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. The computer is yours now. Looks like you're in VHF range, here. So we'll try a VHF check for you. We'll just send the VHF up to you. Stand by.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. VHF check on Simplex Alpha. Over.
Roger, Houston. Apollo 11, VHF Simplex Alpha, loud and clear. How me? Over.
Roger, 11. Houston. You're loud. The standard VHF noise, though, makes you realize that S-band is good.
Roger. Understand. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston. Backup S-band now, and we're standing by for Command Module RCS activation.
Okay. We're just about there.
Apollo 11, Houston, you're Go for Pyro Arm.
Thank you, Houston.
Apollo 11, Houston. Your Command Module pressurization looks mighty fine to us.
Looks good here, Ron.
And 11, Houston, I've got an update for about four items on your Entry PAD.
Ready to copy.
Roger. Your Max-g, 06.3; your Noun 60, your Gamma at 400k, 6.48; your range to go on the EMS, 1403.3; and your Retro time for V-circular, 02:14. Over.
Roger. Copy Max g, 6.3; R2 at Noun 60, 6.48; range to go EMS, 14033; RET V-circular, 02:14. Over.
Roger. Readback is correct there.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, Houston. Go.
Roger. The first horizon check 194:23:06 at a pitch angle of 298 does not quite fall on the 31 7 line. It's just a little high. It's within 5 degrees tolerance.
Apollo 11, Houston. The horizon check there was supposed to be at 33. Over.
Okay. That's fine, sir. Thank you.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Command Module RCS looks fine to us.
Same here, Ron. Looks very good. Doesn't make as much noise as we thought. Some of them are barely audible.
Roger.
And 11, Houston. The weather's still holding real fine in the recovery area.
Looks like it's about 1500 scattered, high scattered. And it's still 3- to 6-foot waves.
The air part of it sounds good.
Roger. [Long pause.]
11, Houston, I'll give you another Mark at 33 minutes. Stand by.
Mark.
Roger that.
Houston, Apollo 11. Do you have any recommended settings to catch the sunset? Over.
Roger. Well, the time is 36:41. And stand by for some settings.
Okay. I'll probably only be doing it maybe - part of it at six frames a second, some of it at one. So I can be changing settings as it goes through.
Roger. Copy. [Pause.]
And the horizon check passes. It's right on the money.
Hey, mighty fine. Sounds good.
Apollo 11, Houston. On the shooting at the Sun, f:16th at 1 over 250.
Understand f:16 at 1 over 250.
Roger.
And the Sun is going down on schedule. It's getting real dark in here.
Apollo 11. Houston. Copy.
Apollo 11, Houston. We see you getting ready for Sep. Everything looks mighty fine down here.
Same here, Ron. Thank you.
Apollo 11, Houston. You're still looking mighty fine here. You're cleared for landing.
We appreciate that, Ron. Thank you.
Rog. Gear's down and locked.
Roger.
Houston, we got the Service Module going by. A little high and a little bit to the right.
Roger. Thank you.
And it's rotating just like it should be. Thrusters are firing.
Good. It's got a lot of gas there to burn out, too.
It's coming across now from right to left.
Houston. Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. You going to turn on the tape recorder shortly?
11, Houston. You can go ahead and turn it on.
Okay. I'll have to go to Command Reset to do that.
11, Houston. That's negative. All you have to do is turn it on. That'll be fine.
I guess I don't know how to turn it on, then. I got PCM/Analog, Record, Forward, High bit rate and barber pole.
11, Houston. We'll send the On command from down here, see if it works.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Got our friend the Moon whipping by the field of view right now.
Roger. Copy.
11, Houston. We'll have you for about 3 or 4 minutes through Redstone and then pick you up after blackout through ARIA.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. I'm going to go to Command Reset and turn the tape on.
11, Houston. Recommend negative on that. That'll put us in low bit rate. [Pause.]
Okay. I already put it to Command Reset, but I still have barber pole on the tape. And now my switch is high bit rate.
Okay. That'll be fine. On 225, there, if you can reach it, Buzz, the last two circuit breakers in the second row from the bottom. Punch those in. [Pause.]
And 11, Houston, don't mess around with that 225 there.
Okay. [Long pause.]
And 11, Houston. You're going over the hill there shortly. You're looking mighty fine to us.
See you later.
