Hello, Houston. Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, Houston. Go.
Roger. Good morning. What's the status on Mid-Course 7?
Roger. We were going to let you sleep in until about 190 hours. Mid-Course 7 is not required.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 11. Good morning from Houston. Over.
Good morning, 11.
Roger. We saw you're up, stirring around, and we thought you're probably eating your breakfast there. Just in general, we'll probably start coming up with the uplink of the state vectors and the target loads and what have you at about 190:50, somewhere in that area, and then get you started to work.
Okay.
And in the meantime, while you're eating your breakfast there, I've got the Maroon Bugle all standing by here to give you the morning news.
Glad to hear it.
Okay. Apollo 11 remains the prime story with the world awaiting your landing today at about 11:49 am Houston time. In Washington, House tax reformers have fashioned a provision which would make it impossible for wealthy individuals to avoid income tax entirely through tax-free investments or special allowances. Under the proposal tentatively adopted by the House Ways and Means Committee, everyone would pay taxes on at least half of their income.
Hang on a minute.
Roger. Standing by.
Okay. Okay, Ron. We're ready to go again. Thank you.
Roger. Continuing with the Maroon Bugle. President Nixon surprised your wives with a phone call from San Francisco just before he boarded a plane to fly out to meet you. All of them were very touched by your television broadcast. Jan and Pat watched from Mission Control here. The launch of Intelsat from the Cape was postponed for the fourth time last night. The problem was said to be a malfunctioning nitrogen regulator in the second stage of the Delta. A new attempt will be made to launch it tonight. The research submarine Ben Franklin, which is studying the Gulf Stream, set a record by drifting 24 hours from 10 to 100 feet [3 to 30 metres] above the ocean floor in 1,300 feet [400 metres] of water off the Georgia coast. The mission is lead by Jacques Piccard. Wally Schirra has been elected to a five-year term on the Board of Trustees of the Detroit Institute of Technology. He will serve on the Institute's development committee. Air Canada says it has accepted 2,300 reservations for flights to the Moon in the past five days. It might be noted that more than 100 have been made by men for their mothers-in-law. And finally it appears that rather than killing romantic songs about the Moon, you have inspired hundreds of song writers. Nashville, Tennessee, which probably houses the largest collection of recording companies and song publishers in the country, now reports it is being flooded by Moon songs. Some will make it. The song at the top of the best sellers list this week is, "In the year 2525." Morning Bugle. Out.
Thank you very much, Ron.
Houston, crew status report: 5.5, 7, 5.5.
Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. We copy. And I have your consumables update, if you're ready to copy.
Go ahead.
Roger. GET 189 plus 00: RCS total, minus 1 percent; Alpha, minus 11; Bravo, plus 10; Charlie, minus 1; Delta, minus 1. H2 total, minus 0.76 pounds; oxygen total, plus 17.6 pounds. Over.
Okay. It doesn't look like we're going to be able to get quite back on the Flight Plan.
Not quite. Just about, though.
Apollo 11, Houston. Request P00 and Accept, and we'll send you a REFSMMAT, state vector, and entry target load. Over.
You have it.
Roger. It'll be coming up.
Apollo 11, Houston. Can you tell us where the visor assemblies ended up, there?
We're going to follow your suggestion and stow them under the right-hand couch.
Roger. Mighty fine. Break. The weather forecast in the landing area right now is 2,000 scattered, high scattered, 10 miles. The wind about 080 at 18 knots. You'll have about 3- to 6-foot waves. Your Delta-H is plus 10 feet. And it looks like you'll be landing about 10 minutes before sunrise. Over.
Okay. Sounds good.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. All three loads are in. The computer is yours. Over.
Roger.
And Mike, if you're on loop there, to extend the range and the constant-g re-entry, here, I've got a little procedure, if you'd like to listen to it.
Stand by one.
Roger.
I'm right in the middle of my orange juice. Be with you in about 5 minutes.
Sure, no problem, standing by.
Houston, Apollo 11. Hey, Ron, I wonder if you could give us a good Navy explanation for this Delta-H term. Over.
Roger. Let me think about it, and I'll come back.
You too, huh?
[Laughter] Right.
Collins has got one, but I'm not sure I buy it.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, 11. We don't have to worry about it any more. The altimeter out there is now standard, 29.92. But basically what it means is that if I give you a plus 10 feet, for instance, that means that you will hit the water with the altimeter reading 10 feet. Over.
All right.
Ah, Collins was wrong.
Apollo 11, Houston. I have your Entry PAD. Over. [Pause.]
Stand by.
Roger. Standing by. [Pause.]
Okay, I'm ready to copy.
Roger. Entry PAD: area is the mid-Pacific; roll 000, 152, 001; GET 194:46:06, 267; latitude, plus 13.32, minus 169.17; 06.4; 36194, 6.49; range to go, 1404.5, 36275; 195:03:06, 00:28, DL max, 1.54, 0.84, 22400, 18000; D0 4.00, 02:13; 00:17, 03:51, 09:02; sextant star, 45, 018.9, 27.7; boresight star, none available; lift vector, Up. Comments: GDC align, Vega and Deneb, roll 078, pitch 223 [means 233 - corrects later], yaw 340. Additional comments: Use non-exit EMS pattern; EI minus 30 horizon check, GET 194:33:06; pitch 298. You'll get P65, but no P66. Additional note: Initial bank angle in P67 may not be full lift. Apollo 11, Houston. Read back. [Long pause.]
Okay, Ron. For MIDPAC: 000, 152, 001; 194:46:06, 267; plus 13.32, minus 169.17; 06.4; 36194, 6.49; 1404.5, 36275; 195:03:06, 00:28, 1.54, 0.84, 2240, 180, 4.00, 02:13; 00:17, 03:51, 09:02; 45, 018.9, 27.7; none available; lift vector, Up; GDC align, Vega and Deneb, roll 078, pitch 223, yaw 340. Use non-exit EMS. EI minus 30 horizon check, 194:33:06, pitch 298. Initial bank angle in P67 may not be full lift, and we will get P65 but no P66.
Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. On your GDC align pitch, it should be 233, 233 in the pitch. Over.
Okay. I've got a 233.
Also your VL and - and Max and Min, I'm sure, are 22,400 and 18,000. Over.
Yeah. That's right.
Okay. If you'll dig out your entry checklist there on page E6-1, I'll update your Retro times there for the various altitudes. Over.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. On page E6-1, your RRT is 07:20, your 50k is 08:16; 40k is 08:30; your 24k is 09:02; and your 10k is 09:51. Over.
Okay. RRT, 07:20; 50,000, 08:16. That's - 07:20 is - is the time the steam pressure's pegged from RRT; and 40,000, 08:30; 24,000, 09:02; 10,000, 09:51.
11, Houston. You started out right, and then the numbers you read back were correct, but I didn't get your comment in between there.
I assume that - all I want to know is that first time, 07:20, that's the time of steam pressure peg. Right?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. Ron, I'm ready to copy your message about the constant drag level.
Okay, Mike. Of course, this is in the event the G&N and the EMS quits and you have to fly the constant-g; and what we're trying to do is to extend the constant-g range from 1,100 to 1,500 miles. We've run this procedure in the simulator, and it works fine. Basically, I'll go through it - just go through it, and then if you have any questions, come back. But it's the same lift vector up until Max g, and then lift vector down, and then modulate the lift vector until g-dot goes to zero. Okay, this procedure is essentially the same so far. And then hold g-dot zero until you pass the Retro elapsed time of V-circular; and then after you pass this Retro elapsed time of V-circular, roll to a gimbal angle of 45 degrees, and then hold this constant bank angle of 45 degrees until you come to the Retro elapsed time of drogues. Over.
Okay. It sounds straightforward enough. Understand constant-g backup - back-up procedure, lift vector up until Max g and then lift vector down, then modulate until bank angle - until g-dot equals zero. Maintain g-dot equals zero until subcircular, then roll 45 degrees and hold until drogue time. Over.
Okay. That's mighty fine, Mike. That's correct.
This entry time line is my kind of time line. Nice and slow.
Okay, 11. Houston. Roger. It sure is. EECOM is anxiously awaiting his big moment here for the logic sequence check whenever you're ready.
Okay. We'll be ready for that in just a flash.
Roger. [Pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead, Ron.
This is Jim, Mike. Backup crew is still standing by. I just want to remind you that the most difficult part of your mission is going to be after recovery.
Well, we're looking forward to all parts of it.
Please don't sneeze. [Pause.]
Yeah, keep the mice healthy. [Pause.]
The Earth is really getting bigger up here and, of course, we see a crescent.
We've been taking pictures and we've still got four exposures to go, and we'll take those and then pack the camera.
Houston, Apollo 11. We're ready for the logic check whenever you are. We're standing by to arm the logic. We've got the ELS logic on, ELS Auto, and all the circuit breakers in.
Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. You can press on with the SECS logic.
Okay. Logic 1 coming on.
Mark it.
Logic 2 coming on.
Mark it. [Pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston. Logic checks good. You're Go for Pyro Arm.
Thank you, sir.
Houston, Apollo 11 has got VHF A Simplex on whenever you want to make a comm check.
Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. You faded out a little bit there, Buzz. I understand you have the VHF Simplex A on now. Is that correct? Over.
That's affirmative. VHF Simplex A and we're TR on VHF.
Roger. Mighty fine. We'll watch it as you're coming on in and let you know when the intelligibility is up and we'll make a voice check with you at that time. [Pause.]
Houston, Apollo 11. I've been holding here in SCS control, Minimum Deadband, Rate Low with the limit cycle on, just as a matter of curiosity, if you guys wanted some fuel numbers from that.
11, Houston. Roger. We copy and we've been figuring it out.
Okay.
It's a pleasure to be able to waste gas.
Roger. That's affirm.
Apollo 11, Houston with a little Recovery Force information. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. The Hornet is on station just far enough off the target point to keep from getting hit. Recovery 1, or the chopper's there; they're on station. And Hawaii Rescue 1 and 2, the C-130s, are within 40 minutes of your target point. Over. [Pause.]
Sounds good. Thank you.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Just to get a little downlink here to check out our VHF. I show us about an hour and 37 minutes, approximately, from Entry Interface. Over.
Okay. That's about right.
Okay. Looks like we're together on that, and I guess we're standing by for you to whip into the entry attitude.
Okay. We've just been taking a couple of last minute pictures. We've finished the EMS entry check, primary water EVAP activation.
Roger. Mighty fine.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Mike. We recommend the left VHF antenna for VHF.
Thank you, that.
And this is your friendly backup CMP. Have a good trip, and ma - 'member to come in BEF.
You better believe. Thank you kindly.
We can see the Moon passing by the window and it looks what I consider to be a correct size.
Houston, Apollo 11. Like to switch to S-band Omni C. I just did a minute ago, and noticed a loss of signal strength, over.
Roger, Apollo 11. Go ahead and try it again now that you're in attitude.
Roger. Going Omni C.
Apollo 11, Houston. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston. Recommend antenna Bravo. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Recommend antenna Bravo, or at least a better one. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead, Ron.
Roger. Faces are red here. We lost data with you there for a while. Did you do the P52? Over.
That's affirmative, we've completed the P52. We'll give you the data from it in just a second. We passed our sextant star check at entry attitude, and right now we're maneuvering to our first horizon check pitch attitude of 298 degrees.
Roger. Copy that, 11.
Apollo 11, Houston. About 4 minutes to 1 hour, and I'll give you a mark at 1 hour. Was a Command Module pre-heat necessary? Over.
Negative that.
Roger. Copy. Negative Command Module pre-heat.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We don't want to jettison the hydrogen tank that's stratified, so could you cycle the fans in Tank 2 please? Hydrogen Tank 2.
You better believe. That old Service Module's taken good care of us. We want to take good care of it.
It sure has, hasn't it.
It's been a champ.
11, Houston. I'll give you a time hack at 58 minutes to go. It's about 15 seconds yet.
Thank you. [Pause.]
Stand by.
Mark.
58 minutes.
Roger.
