Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're standing by. [Pause.]
Roger. Apollo 11.
Rog. We'd like you, sometime at your convenience, to stir up the cryos on this pass. And wondering if you got the fuel cell purge. Over.
Roger. The [garble] fuel cell purge is complete.
Say again. You're breaking up.
Roger. The O2 fuel cell purge is complete.
Rog. Copy.
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We've got a load for you, if you give us P00 and Accept. The load consists of a CSM pre-TEI state vector that's going in the CSM slots, and a post-TEI state vector that'll go into the LM slots, if that's okay. And also a TEI target load. Any comments? Over.
Very good. Thank you very much.
Yes, sir.
P00 and Accept. You got it.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
And, 11, Houston. A reminder. You can scratch the Verb 66 at 134:30.
Understand. [Long pause.]
And, 11, Houston. For your information, Eagle, we had an ISS fail light came on at about 3:19 due to a CDU overheating. And at about this time, at AOS, it looks like we're about to lose the platform.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. We got the load in. You can have the computer...
11. Are you through with the computer?
That's affirmative, Buzz.
All right. That's timing for you. [Long pause.]
And, Apollo 11, Houston. Your friendly White Team has your coming home information, if you're ready to copy. Over. [Pause.]
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11. Ready to copy.
Rog, 11. Got two PADs for you, TEI-30 and then a TEI-31. TEI-30, SPS/G&N: 36691, minus 0.61, plus 0.66; 135:23:41.56. Noun 81: 32 - correction, plus 3201.1, plus 0681.8, minus 0265.0; 181, 054, 014. Apogee is NA, perigee, plus 0023.0; 3286 - correction, 32836; burn time 2:28, 3262.8; 24, 151.1, 35.7. Next three lines are NA. Noun 61: plus 11.03, minus 172.37; 1180.6, 36275, 195:04:52. Set stars are Deneb and Vega, 242, 172, 012. We'd like ullage from two jets for 16 seconds, and the horizon is on the 10-degree line at TIG minus 2 minutes, and your sextant star is visible after 134 plus 50. Stand by on your readback. I have a TEI-31 if you're ready to copy. Over.
Roger. TEI-30, SPS/G&N: 36691, minus 0.61, plus 0.66; 135:23:41.56; plus 3201.1, plus 0681.8, minus 0265.0; 181, 054, 014. Apogee NA, plus 0023.0; 32836, 2:28, 32628; 24, 151.1, 35.7. NA three times. Plus 11.03, minus 172.37; 1180.6, 36275, 195:04:52. Deneb and Vega, 242, 172, 012. Two-jet ullage, 16 seconds. Horizon out-of-the-window, 10 degrees, TIG minus 2 minutes. Sextant star at 134:10. Over.
Roger, Buzz. Good readback. You're very weak. If you're ready to copy, I got a TEI-31 for you. Over. [Long pause.]
All right. Go ahead. [Pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston. You were cut out. Say again. [Pause.]
Roger. Stand by one.
Rog. [Pause.]
All right. Go ahead. I'm ready to copy.
Roger, 11. TEI-31, SPS/G&N: 36691, minus 0.61, plus 0.66, 137:22:39.85. Plus 3283.8, plus 0684.5, minus 0248.7. NA, pitch 052. Rest of the PAD is NA. Ready for your readback. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. TEI-31, SPS/G&N: 36691; minus 0.61, plus 0.66; 137:22:39.85. Plus 3283.8, plus 0684.5, minus 0248.7. NA, pitch 052. The rest is NA. Over.
Roger. Good readback. And, Buzz, did you say sextant star is visible after 134:50? [Pause.]
No. I wrote down 134:10. I wasn't real sure about that.
Roger. It went by me there. Retro caught it. It's 134:50. Over.
Okay. 134:50. Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. After the burn, we'd like you to trim X and Z. Over. [Pause.]
Okay, Charlie.
Rog. And that's to two-tenths of a foot per second, as shown in the Flight Plan. [Long pause.]
Sounds like there's a story behind that one, too.
We'll tell you when you get back.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Would you verify that you've stirred up the Cryos? Over.
Roger. We've stirred them up.
Thank you, sir.
Apollo 11, Houston. You are Go for TEI. Over.
Apollo 11. Thank you.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You've got about 8 minutes 'til LOS. Your AOS with the burn, 135:34:05, no burn 135:44. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Apollo 11, Houston. One minute to LOS. Go sic 'em.
Thank you, sir. We'll do it.
Yes. We can get Verb 64 before we come over the hill and see what looks good.
Okay. LOS.
Okay. I'm ready to proceed now.
Do it.
Here we go.
Say, you guys ready - you got anything you want to do?
I got to make a star check, yet.
You're not going to fool around with that camera any more, are you?
No.
I'll take care of it for you.
Post - we might run it post - after PDI if you can put it somewhere where you can get at it, going away from the Moon. I just didn't want it in my way...
Get all...
Well, yes, pull it - pull it out of the way.
Neil, the handle...
I have it right here. That durn near has a roll in it - it...
I'll bet you [garble] likes this.
No. I don't care about any - Well, if it's annoying - let me - I can get it if it is. [Garble] star check [garble] I don't care about [garble].
What's that PAD say about horizon on the 100-degree...
2 minutes prior, 100-degree line.
You got double lines?
Yes, I got double line on the 30, so I can use that as a head position device and then look down between them.
They're not - they're not parallel? I assume one-eye position?
No, What I'm saying is, on the 30 degree, I have both panes of glass in...
Yes.
...and if you line those up then, uh, is your eye in the right position for all the others?
Yes.
Okay.
What's the shaft and trunnion number?
1511.
What? 1511 357
151...
1511.
We're a long way from being there, Neil. We're rolling over at a very slow rate.
Okay.
You want to expedite? We got a lot of gas...
No, no, no.
Be happy to zip on around there.
Cause this thing's taking forever to get around here. We've got 20 minutes to TIG. I think I'll speed it up a bit, if you don't mind.
Hey, you got - 1, one tenth, point 1, I mean?
Yeah, two tenths.
You know, if you hit this hand controller like you do in the simulator, Minimum Impulse, just bang it, it'll bang over and bang back, and it'll fire two opposing pulses, and you get nothing.
[Laughter.] Yes.
Oh, shit. Got a yaw out 14 degrees. Why in the hell didn't I do that? Read that number wrong.
Yes, it should have been 1.4 degrees yaw.
That '1' gets moved over so far.
Yes, the goddam '1' in this computer, you know - trunnion angle, it's there; Delta-V, it's there; angles, it's there. It's probably over here for something although I can't think of what, but there, there, and there, and there, of course - there is four places.
Okay, we're there, Neil. By the time you can get down there and get your eyeball out the window...
Hey, what did you do with those numbers again?
Oh, we'll crank them in the computer.
Oh, I got them.
Question the accuracy of the computer?
[Garble].
Okay, you satisfied with that?
Enter.
Give me the numbers.
1519, CMC Optics Zero, Off, Verb 41, Noun 91.
You mean after I went to all this work of cranking those numbers in you're going to drive back to zero?
We got Program Alarm and an Operator Error.
[Laughter.]
Christ! Give me the numbers. 1519 and what?
It won't pass with that number.
1511 - 357.
357, okay.
357 and 1511. There's supposed to be a star there.
That's right, if you put them in - in the right order. That 151.1 is shaft.
Yes. I got a star in the - in the sextant.
Good, it passes. Let's press on.
I'm not sure it's Gienah.
Good. There'll be no way of telling - You got 16 minutes until TIG. Did it pass?
Optics Zero...
Optics Zero and Manual. The mode is Manual already, isn't it? Okay?
All right. Verb 37, Enter. 40, Enter. Okay.
Okay, BMAG Mode, three, to Rate 2.
BMAG Mode, three, to Rate 2.
Spacecraft Control, CMC, Auto.
CMC, Auto.
Proceed.
I'll proceed with this trim.
Huh? That's good - apparently not. Don't you like this one? Alright.
Let's not proceed.
Alright. Stand by. Align spacecraft in roll. Already there.
GDC Align.
Okay, that's a good one. One - standby one, I'll get that.
Okay. GDC aligned.
Circuit breakers: Stabilization Control, Panel 8, Closed.
Stabilization Control circuit breakers are Closed.
Okay. SPS circuit breakers - eight of them, Closed. Twelve of them closed.
SPS, 12 of them closed - 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, Closed. Okay?
[Garble]. Now I've dropped it.
Say again.
I lost my clip.
Att Deadband, Minimum.
Att Deadband, Minimum.
Rate, Low.
Rate, Low.
Limit Cycle, On.
Okay.
Man Att, three - Rate Command.

SCS TVC, two, to Rate Command.
Rate Command, Rate Command.
TVC Gimbal Drive, Pitch and Yaw, to Auto.
Auto, Auto.
What's the time?
We have 12 minutes to go.
Got the Helium Valves, Auto and barber pole?
I'll get those.
Okay. I was just wondering if they were on - not questioning your checklist, just out of curiosity.
You going to pitch up after the burn?
Sounds like a good idea. Let's look at the Moon after the burn. That'll give us High Gain, right?
Good.
Okay, 10 minutes until TIG.
Alright.
It's hot in here, isn't it?
[Garble] boiling any water.
You do it all?
No. It's not too hot, it's 65.
Those temperatures are deceptive. I don't know where they measure it, but the cold point is...
Okay. Sunrise, now 10 minutes prior to TIG. I should have the horizon on the 10-degree line, huh?
No, 10 degrees - 2 minutes.
2 minutes. That's more like it, there.
Can't [garble] all through this COAS. As far as steering and everything goes, it'll be hopeless.
[Garble] minutes to go.
I'm graphically reminded of it at this moment. Uh huh. I see a horizon. It looks like we are going forward [laughter].
Shades of Gemini.
It is most important that we be going forward [laughter].
There's only one really bad mistake you can make there.
Shades of Gemini retrofire, are you sure we're - [laughter] - No, let's see - yes, the motors point this way and the gases escape that way, therefore imparting a thrust that-a-way.
Yes, horizon looks good.
Okay, we got 8½ to TIG.
Somewhere along the line, I think I'll trim this maneuver just for the hell of it. Would this be a good time to do it, Buzz, at 8 minutes prior? You don't care when I do it, do you?
No, it probably would be after we - when the gimbals are out.
Oh, yes, alright. You're right. Okay.
Beautiful looking horizon, it's hard to describe.
We can see it if we look through that thing that you have.
Worth seein'.
Here or here? God, it has an eerie look to it. It's not a horizon, it's just a band.
You won't be able to see it, Neil, [garble]. Mostly.
Which way?
This way. Plus X. Oh yeah [garble].
It was really eerie when it first came...
You got to look through the part of the window that isn't...
Yes. And the way the terminator is, you don't see the whole Moon at all, you just see a...
I know, I was looking at it upside down for a while.
Yes, and then that scares you, because that says you're going retrograde, right? Well, let's see, if it's upside down, you're going backwards.
Yes, it wasn't.
Okay, it looks good, I'll tell you.
Alright, we're coming up on bus tie time. We've got a little over 6:50 until TIG.
Ready for the bus ties.
Yes, sir. Whenever you are. It's about 6 minutes.
[Garble]. On, verified.
Okay.
[Garble], On. [Garble] and a half.
Alright.
Okay. TVC Servo Power 1 to AC1.

Okay. When do you want the gimbal motors on?
Oh, at about 5½ minutes.
Okay, that's right now.
Right now?
Yes.
Okay.
Here comes Pitch 1, ready?
No.
Wait a minute. Okay. Go.
Pitch 1.
Pitch 1...
Mark it.
Got it.
Yaw 1...
Mark it.
Got it.
Okay. Translation Controller, clockwise.

Pitch 2...
Mark it.
Got it.
Yaw 2...
Mark it.
Got it.
Okay. Set GPI trim.
Alright, where are they on this PAD? Let's see, that's plus...
Minus - on pitch, minus 0.6.
Okay, minus 0.6. Very good.
Plus 66.
And plus 6...
0.6.
Okay, Neil, those look good to you? They look good to me.
[Garble] 0.6 - 0.6 - 0.6 [garble].
Okay. GPI set. Verify MTVC.
Okay. MTVC verified. I'm on trim now.
Proceed to trim.
Does it look to you like plus X is flying the right way?
Yes. [Inaudible.] Yeah.
Alright. [Garble] we're coming up on [garble] out to your right.
Okay.
Okay, verify MTVC.
Verified.
Translation Controller, Neutral.
Neutral.
GPI return to zero, zero.
It does.
Rot Control Power, Normal, number 2, to AC/DC.
AC/DC.
Spacecraft Control, CMC.

Trim.
We did.
Okay. BMAG Mode, three, to Att 1, Rate 2.
Att 1, Rate 2.
Enter.
Enter.
Verify CMC.
CMC verified. Auto verified.
Proceed.
Okay, for the Gimbal Drive: Up, down, zero. Up, down, zero. Okay, standing by for P-AX, Off, and Y-AX, Off... [meaning Pitch Axis and Yaw Axis.]
Mark it.
Good trim.
Rotational Control Power, Direct, two, Main A/Main B.
Main A/Main B.
SPS Helium Valves, two of them, verified Auto. Limit Cycle, Off.
Okay, Limit Cycle's Off.
FDAI Scale, 50/15.
50/15.
Okay, wait for 2 minutes for Delta-V Thrust A.
2 minutes to get our horizon check at 10 degrees.
Yes, and - sneaking up on there, looks pretty darn good. Looks like we're darn near right.
Just about midnight in Houston town.
Yes.
Okay, coming up on 2 minutes, and this damn horizon check is going to be, would you believe, perfect?
I hope so.
Fantastic. First time we ever gotten a perfect horizon check. Spent too many hours in the simulator looking for an unreal horizon. Alright, horizon check passes.
Beautiful.
2 minutes...
Delta-V Thrust A...
To Normal.
...Delta-V...
Translation Controller, Armed.
...okay, Delta-V Thrust A, Normal. Stand by for a malfunction - it's not there. Good deal.
[Garble, overlapping with last]. Probably get the Sun in your window on that burn.
Yes, I believe it.
That Sun is [garble]...
Rotational Hand Controller, number 2, Armed.
Rotational Hand Controller, number 2, is Armed.
Alright.
Ullage is going to be 16 seconds at 2 jets.
Tape Recorder is going to Command Reset on the High Bit Rate.
Got to go from Standby to Normal.
I'll do that in 35 seconds.
Ullage is 16 seconds, 2 Jets.
16 seconds, 2 jets, confirmed.
Coming up on one minute...
Mark it.
Okay, stand by for 35 seconds.
Mark it...
DSKY blanks. EMS is in Normal.
Check.
Coming up on 15 seconds.
Okay, I'll get the 99, Neil.
Okay.
Okay. Stand by...
...stand by for ullage. Ullage.
Got the ullage.
[Garble] 5, 4, 3, 2...
Burn! A good one. Nice...
I got two balls...
...okay, here comes the other two...
...barber pole, gray, the other two are on good.
Man, that feels like g, doesn't it?
I caught up - I caught up for a short while, but [garble].
Go to duplex. Pressures are good. Busy in steering, but it's holding right in there.
How is it, Mike?
It's really busy in roll, but it's holding in its deadband. Looks like it's holding instead of plus or minus 5, more like plus or minus 8. It's possible that we have a roll-thruster problem, but if we have, it's taking it out. No point in worrying about it. Okay, coming up on 1 minute...
Mark it...
One minute. Chamber pressure's holding right on 100.
[Garble] time looks good.
Gimbals look good. Total attitude looks good. Rates are damped out - a little bit. Still a little busy, light vehicle.
[Garble] still ahead.
Still busy in roll.
Should I be going [garble]?
Follow the needle, fly to the needle [garble] could. Dont know. Take it off. Okay. Looking good.
This was [garble]...
[Garble].
How's that nitrogen pressure? Okay?
Yes.
Good.
[Garble] pressures are Go.
2 minutes...
Mark it...
Hits the end of that roll deadband, it really comes crisply back.
Okay, chamber pressure's falling off a little bit. Now it's going back up. Chamber pressure's oscillating just a tad.
10 seconds left, [garble]...
We don't care about the chamber pressure, [garble] watch yourself for - brace yourself. Standing by for Engine, Off.
It should be shutdown now.
Okay?
Shutdown! 4...
[Garble] going to gray and barber pole.
Okay?
Okay.
Let's look at what we got. Delta-V Thrust A and B are Off...
A and B are Off.
...SPS valves, Closed?
Okay.
Stand by for the Gimbal Motors.
Okay.
Pitch 1, Off...
Yaw 1, Off.
Got it.
Pitch 2, Off.
Got it.
Yaw 2, Off.
Got it. TVC Servo Power 1 and 2 are Off?
Off, Off.
Main Bus Tie's coming On [should be Off] - okay.
Proceed.
Beautiful.
X and - 0.2.
X and Z, 0.2...
X and Z, good.
F. [?] Okay, and Z is down. Okay, then - you want to record those - five balls...
Let me record them...
...five balls, plus 0.0, and call it 0.08. It was hanging on 0.07 for a while, and it was zeroed and down. I'd give them - it was 0.1 down - plus 0.1. Now it's on zero, shit! Can't read those residuals, they dance all over the place.
Okay, the residuals were 0.1, 3.9, and point...
Beautiful burn. SPS, I love you! You are a jewel! Whoosh!
Alright. EMS Function, Off.
EMS Function...
EMS Mode to Standby.
Standby.
BMAG Mode, three, to Rate 2. Deadband, Max...
Three to Rate 2. Deadband, Max...
[Garble] Off, [garble] Off...
Got the burn time to be about 02:30. You in Bit Rate Low?
02:30 or 02:31...
Okay. Let's go. Rotational Control Power, Direct, two of them, Off?
Off, Off. Good show.
We want to pitch over, I guess. Don't know if it matters much which way.
Oh, probably - up will be the best...
Yeah.
Pitch up.
...to keep the Moon in sight.
Alright, is that Rotational Control Power, Direct, two of them, Off?
Yes, I do.
Circuit breakers - SPS Pitch 1, Pitch 2, Yaw 1, Yaw 2, Open?
They're open.
Proceed.
I think you did that already.
Hey, Neil, you want to proceed on these?
Yes.
Okay, where do we go, P00? To get the High Gain?
We want - Yes, P00's good - and we want a Verb 48.
Yes. Get in P00 and do a Verb 83.
I'm going to go to SCS and pitch up in the meantime.
Find out where that - other state vector is.
Okay, we're in P00, now who wants what? Verb 48?
No - yes. Verb - oh, okay.
Ah...
I don't load the - I don't.
Well, it says change spacecraft weight.
DAP update. Well that...
You've got your...
...10101 does change - it has been changed. Okay, we've done that.
Verb 83.
[Garble] Service Module RCS...
I've done that. Done that.
Oh. Okay...
Verb 83.
...RCS monitors checked - [Laughter]. Okay, here comes Buzz's baby - Verb 83 - de-dum-de-dum-de-dum. Operator error. [Laughter.]
Because you don't know how to do it.
[Laughter.]
Look at that, would you? Look at that.
Isn't that beautiful?
Pretty good.
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
Alright, now call the Verb 89 and see which way the...
Oh, come on, you're not serious.
[Garble] what are you doing? Go to find out which way the Moon is...
Okay.
[Garble] you were wrong. [Garble].
Okay, we got to visually acquire Moon, take pictures, and then you got a P52 to do.
You all right?
[Garble] for some unknown reason...
We haven't got any damned program ready to call up. [Garble]. It's the only way you can do it. Supposed to do a Verb 66 and then put numbers [garble] apogee [garble] and then look at altitude and altitude rate...
What are you doing, Mike? What you taking pictures of...
Oh, I don't know. Wasting film, I guess.
You can take some pretty good pictures out of the hatch, here.
You're right. This crapping thing - [garble] is it set on f:4 or 5.6; that's probably about right.
Here's a ring that came from somewhere, I wonder where? (singing)
You want to take pictures over here? Go ahead, why don't you just set up that...
I'll check Window 3.
...set up that tape and let it do its thing. It's still got a long way to go for [garble].
Alright, now. Do we want black and white, color, 250, or 80? I've got all options over here.
Oh, we'll probably want - How many cameras you got?
Let me have a camera. How many cameras?
Well, only one camera, but I've got [garble] lenses.
You're a poor [garble].
Well, let's take some color, and...
With the 80, right? On this one?
Yeah, I think you want to get, uh...
Let me know when I'm in a - in a good attitude to stop this pitch. How about right now?
Stop. What are you doing?
I'm rolling.
What for? What do you want to roll for?
I was off in roll. I'm correcting back to where it should have been. This is a pretty good attitude right here, looks to me...
Alright, I've seen enough of Verb 83, Mike...
Here you go.
...unless you want to call a Verb 89.
Not me. I'd rather take pictures.
What time is AOS?
Haven't the foggiest.
It's 135:34.
That's right now.
Give me a Verb 51.
Anybody got any choice greetings they want to make to Houston?
No, I - the best burn I've ever seen in my life, I'll tell you. I guess you guys have seen two good ones today.
Oh, a couple.
Yes, more than two. AOS.
AOS.
Rog. Zero - minus 0.7, minus 0.2.
Yes, we sure as hell have.
Get the burn status.
Hey, I hope somebody's getting the picture of the Earth coming up.
[Garble]. Not quite pitched far enough. Well, maybe I can get it out...
I can get around to here.
[Garble] your window.
Upside down, turn the camera upside down. Then it'll look right.
Hello Apollo 11. Houston. How did it go? Over.
Tell 'em to open up the LRL doors, Charlie.
Roger. We got you coming home. It's well stocked.
Okay, Burn status: Delta-TIG was zero, burn time was 2 plus 30. PAD angles: Delta-VGX after trim was 0.1, VGY 0.9, VGZ 0.1. Delta-VC minus 17.9, fuel 10.6, Ox 10.4, unbalance minus 50.
Roger. Copy, Neil. Sounds good to us. [Long pause.]
And Apollo 11, Houston. You - All your systems look real good to us. We'll keep you posted.
Rog.
Hey, Charlie boy, looking good here. That was a beautiful burn. They don't come any finer.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston. I wondered if you've compared your pre-T - your state vector after TEI with the one in the LM slots? Over.
Yes, sir, and that one looked very nice. Verb 83 was plus 00070 and minus 00008.
Rog. [Long pause.]
11, Houston. I was looking at your bank Bravo nitrogen tank. It didn't leak a bit - correction - didn't leak a bit this time. Over.
Roger. Looked good here.
Chamber pressure was hanging in there around 100. The latter part of the burn, it started oscillating a little bit and got down a little bit below 100.
Roger.
96 or so.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give us P00 and Accept? We've got a REFSMMAT for you. Over. [Pause.]
Okay.
Thank you.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've got the load in. You can go back to Block. Over.
We're there.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Your Command Module film seems to be working out pretty well, Charlie, the amount we carried. Looks like we carried just about what we needed.
Wonderful.
We have one 16-millimeter roll of the ASA-1000 color interior film. We were thinking of shooting that during the entry, out window number 4 on a bracket, and you might get the camera guys sometime in the next couple of days to give us all the good settings for that.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Wondered if, during the TEI burn, you utilized the oxidizer flow valve on the PUGS? Over.
Yes, we did. Based on your very excellent briefing I was expecting the thing to continue desiring increase for the whole time, so we started out with it in Increase. I saw that we pretty quickly crossed the line and started falling about 6, 7 percent behind, so I was still expecting it to move up, and I went down to Full Decrease and brought it back down to a difference of 2 percent. Over.
Rog. Thank you very much, Buzz.
Two-tenths of a percent, I'm sorry.
Rog. Thank you.
Apollo 11, Houston. You can go to PTC attitude and torque at your con - and do the P52 and torque at your convenience. Over.
Hey, we got to take some more pictures, Charlie. Is there any constraint, normally, in staying here for a while?
No, sir.
Thank you.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
How does that tracking look, or is it too early to tell?
Stand by, Mike. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston. FIDOs are looking at the data. It's too early to tell yet exactly. It's looking real good so far. We'll have you some answers shortly on trajectory. Over.
Okay. What FIDO is it?
That's Jay Greene.
Howdy, Jay. [Long pause.]
11, Houston. We have a DAP CSM update for you.
Go ahead.
Rog. CSM weight, Mike: 26370. Over.
Thank you, sir.
Welcome.
Apollo 11, Houston. We've taken your onboard vector and propagated it forward, and it's looking real good. We only got about 24 minutes of tracking now. Really too early to tell on the radar. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Mike, did you notice any transients at ignition on TEI? Over.
Yeah. The transients were more noticeable than on previous burns, Charlie. I just wrote it off on the fact we had a light Command Module, but there was considerable roll activity which dampened down after the first, oh, 20 seconds, I would guess, of the burn. But there - there was also some pitch and yaw activity. I don't believe it was abnormal, and seemed to be deadbanding rather crisply in roll plus or minus about 8 degrees either side of center line. And after the first couple of - oh, after the first 20 seconds or so, the gimbals were quiet, and pitch and yaw were relatively quiet. Before that, there was some oscillation but mostly just in rates. Total attitude hung in there pretty well.
Roger. Thank you much. We were looking at the playback, and we saw some things that - right at start up. We'll be back with you later on that.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. Have you finished taking pictures? Over.
We're just finishing up, Charlie.
Rog.
About to get started on a P52 here pretty soon.
Copy.
Another 8 or 9 hours.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can crank up on the PTC at any time. Over.
All right-oh. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Rog, 11. This is the original CapCom. Congratulations on an outstanding job. You guys have really put on a great show up there. I think it's about time you powered down and got a little rest, however. You've had a mighty long day here. Hope you're all going to get a good sleep on the way back. I look forward to seeing you when you get back here. Don't fraternize with any of those bugs en route, except for the Hornet.
Okay. Thank you, boss. We'll - We're looking forward to a - to a little rest and a restful trip back. And see you when we get there.
Rog. You've earned it. [Long pause.]
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to turn off O2 Tank Number 1 heaters. Over. [Pause.]
It's off. Thank you.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. For your information, the LGC in Eagle just went belly up at 7 hours. Over.
Okay. Very good. That was the death of a real winner, there. [Long pause.]
Charlie, we're going to rotate about pitch 270 degrees on the way home vice 1 - or 090 on the way out. Right?
Right, sir.
Okay. Verb 49 maneuver to that attitude is in progress.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Houston, crew status report. Radiation: CDR 11017, CMP 10019, LMP 09020. No medication.
Say again, please, Neil. We - you were breaking up. We missed that. Over.
Okay. This is a crew status report. Radiation: CDR 11017, CMP 10019, LMP 09020. No medication.
Roger. Thank you.
And we didn't get a crew status report from you this morning. Wondered if you could give us an estimate of sleep last night. Over.
Okay [garble]. [Long pause.]
Okay. We'll take a guess, Charlie, and try to give an equivalent amount and call it CDR 3 and LMP 4.
Rog. Thank you very much. [Long pause.]
And, Charlie, you want the fans cycled, I think that's right?
That's affirmative, and we'd like you to disable quads Charlie and Delta. Over.
Okay. Charlie and Delta. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston. If it's convenient, we'd like to go through your onboard readout. Over. [Pause.]
Of what?
Oh, excuse me. It's on the Flight Plan, 3-102. We'd like Batts and RCS. Over.
Stand by.
Ready to copy, Houston?
Roger. Go ahead.
Batt Charlie 37.0, Pyro Batt A 37.0, Batt B 37.0. RCS; 55, 65, 64, and 62. Over.
Roger. We copy all that. Thank you much.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. A couple of questions for the Moonwalkers, if you got a second. Over.
Go ahead.
Rog, Neil. We're seeing some temperature rises on the Passive Seismic Experiment that are a little higher than normal and were wondering if you could verify the deployed position. We understand it's about 40 feet from the LM in the eleven o'clock position. Over. [Pause.]
No. It's about in the nine or nine-thirty position, and I'd say it's about 50 or 60 feet.
Roger. Copy. Also, did you notice - was there any indication of any dust cloud as you lifted off? Over.
Not very much. There was quite a bit of Kapton and parts of the LM that went out in all directions, usually for great distances, as far as I can tell. But I don't remember seeing anything of a dust cloud to speak of.
Roger. Understand all you could see was parts of the LM going out. What was your - your first - first comment? Over.
I don't remember. Just could see Kapton and other parts of the LM staging scattering all around the area for great distances, but I didn't see much dust.
Rog. Thank you very much.
Houston, Apollo 11. Could you keep me honest on the lithium hydroxide changes? When do you have the next one scheduled for?
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston. Mike, on that canister, we had you due to change one at 133 before TEI, and it's on page 3-99. The next one we got is at 147. Over.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like to extend our damping period for another 5 minutes. Let the rates get way down. Over.
11. Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
Roger, Charlie. Like to bring you up to date on our chlorination status. In compartment B4, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven - correction, we have eight pockets for chlorine and buffer ampules, of which - let me correct that. We have seven pockets, of which one is empty and always has been empty, leaving six remaining. On the other side over there in B7, we have another container with seven pockets, so we have a total of seven plus six, and those are filled with six chlorines and seven buffers. Now, I've been using one chlorine and one buffer per day which, at this point in time, prior to this chlorination I'm about to do, leaves me one chlorine and two buffers. Seems to me I'm one chlorine short, and that being the case, I'd like to ask your advice on postponing this chlorination using the last container until some later date, like maybe tomorrow. Over.
Rog. We copy, Mike. Stand by.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Check in A1, Mike, and see what you can find in there. Over.
We think you might have some more chlorine up in A1. Over. [Long pause.]
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 11. [Pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston. Do you read? You're breaking up. Over.
Roger. Reading [garble].
Roger, 11. You're breaking up. Mike, please look in compartment A1. We think there might be some more chlorine up there. Over.
Eureka!
11, Houston. Reading you about one-by. Over.
11, Houston. We're having a downlink problem, the reason we can't read you. We're switching sites. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. How do you read now? Over. [Pause.]
Fine.
Rog. You're five-by now, too, Mike. Thank you much. Did you copy that about A1 on that chlorine?
Eureka!
How about that, sports fans!
Apollo 11, Houston. We're having a little trouble getting the yaw rate damped out to appropriate value. We'd like y'all to be quiet like mice for a couple of minutes and let's see if that'll help it out. Over.
11, Houston. You did great work there. We're ready to spin it up. Over. [Long pause.]
11, Houston. Did you copy? Over. [Pause.]
Yeah. We read you, Charlie. Would you stand by a minute?
Rog. No hurry. [Long pause.]
11, Houston. Shift change time, here. White Team bids you good night. We'll see you tomorrow. Over.
Good night, Charlie. Thank you.
Good night, Charlie. Thank you.
Adios.
Adios. Thanks again for a great show, you guys.
Thanks for a great job down there.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Good morning, Owen.
Howdy there, Mike. We're ready to go ahead and have you switch to your Omni positions for your sleep period, and we would like the following High Gain switch positions: your High Gain antenna in Manual, beam width Wide, pitch is minus 50, and yaw is a plus 270. And just follow the Flight Plan for remaining Comm configuration. Over.
Roger that.
You Purple people keep funny hours.
Your Comm is pretty weak at this point, Mike. Please say again.
Roger. Disregard. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11.
It's on the way now.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like for you to go ahead and put your S-band antenna Omni to Omni and Omni B. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. How do you read me through Honeysuckle now? Over. [Pause.]
You're loud and clear, Owen.
Very good. Reading you better now. And did you copy we'd appreciate going S-band Omni and Omni B at this time? Over.
That's the configuration we're in.
Okay. Thank you.
I'll tell you. Purple people keep funny hours.
