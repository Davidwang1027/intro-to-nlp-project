Houston, Apollo 11.
11, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger, Houston. I'd like to do a P52 option 3 and tweak the platform up prior to starting the PTC. Over.
Roger, 11. Stand by. [Pause.]
11, Houston. That sounds like a good idea to us. Go ahead.
Okay. And the platform's looking pretty good to me. It looks like the worst axis drift is 0.01 something degrees per hour. Is that about what you figure?
11, Roger. We've had reports all the marks have been good all the - the last couple of times you've run them. Just a moment; I'll get you some information on the apparent drift rate.
Okay, Owen. Thank you. You got the Maroons on?
Say again, 11.
I say you got the Maroons on now?
Not permanently, Mike. Just have a stand-by here while Charlie's out checking how to use that special tool on the camera. The Maroon Team will be on tomorrow.
Okay. Nice to hear your voice. How's everything going?
Everything's going smoothly here. We sure enjoyed the show this afternoon, Mike.
Okay. [Long pause.]
11, Houston. We suggest you go ahead and do the P52 first, and we'll take a look at the angles and give you some new drift rates after taking a look at them. Over.
All right. Fair enough.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Go ahead. 11, here.
11, Houston. A little information to you there, CDR. We've all taken a momentary brief respite from our work here to have some special - have a bite of special moon cheese that is - I understand it's been sent to us directly from Wapakoneta, [Overheard in MCC: Wow! Congratulations.] your own hometown. Over.
No, we can't...
We can't pronounce it either.
I think you'll enjoy that. They make a fine brand of cheese.
Roger, there, and I'll polish up the grammar for the next trip. [Laughter overheard in MCC.] [Pause.]
Houston, 11. You're looking at the Noun 93, and I'll proceed when you copy them.
11, Houston. We've got them.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like P00 and Accept. We have a Delta-H update for you. Over.
All right, Charlie. Stand by one.
Houston, Apollo 11. P00 and Accept.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. We got the load in. The computer's yours. Over.
Houston, Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to stir up the cryos now. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Rog.
Houston, Apollo 11. We're completed in the LM. We're closing up the hatches and the probe and drogue back in.
Roger. We copy. Out.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're standing by to watch your startup on the PTC at any time. You can start off with the Verb 49. Over.
Wilco. We're just finishing up the probe and about to close up the hatch here. We're going to be a couple of minutes late, probably, getting started in the PTC.
Rog. No sweat, 11. We're standing by. Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Mike, there's no wait required. Where rates are steady, you can proceed on. Over.
I'm doing it, Charlie.
Rog. [Pause.]
The tunnel's all taken care of. The drogue, probe, and hatch all back in.
Roger. Copy. Out.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have some new additions to your alternate and contingency checklist if you would break that out. Over. [Pause.]
Stand by.
Okay, Houston. 11's ready to copy.
Roger, 11. If you'll turn to page F/2-22. Over. [Long pause.]
Okay. I have F/2-22.
Roger, Neil. Under column L - that's column Lima. Line 06, the new data is 00001. Line 07, the new data is 02134. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. I have in F/2-22, column Lima, item 6, 00001; item 7, 02134.
Roger. That's correct. Thank you much. Out. [Long pause.]
11, Houston. For your information, those two entries are an update to your Delta-H that we are - have already uplinked into the CMC. Over.
Roger. Thank you. [Long pause.]
What was I marking on, Charlie? About an 18-kilometer line, or what?
We - Our update puts you to - the Delta-H to 35 kilometers, Mike. Over.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've got some switch positions for you for the High Gain. Over.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger, Buzz. Select Bravo, Omni, High Gain Track to Manual; Beam, Wide. Over.
Okay. Bravo, Omni; Track, Manual; and Beam, Wide.
Roger. And your High Gain angles are minus 50 on the pitch, 270 on the yaw. Over.
Okay. Going there now.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have some updates and some things we'd like to talk to you about, if you aren't in the middle of your meal. If it's convenient any time for you, we're ready with some updates. Over. [Long pause.]
What - What are the updates going to apply to?
Roger. We have a couple of changes on the LM mission rules No-Go for your No-Go card, Neil. One slight change on the APS/DPS fuel and temp/pressure card, and we have a change to the procedure for the secondary radiator leak check, which is to be formed at - performed at 71 hours tomorrow, and also some indications that we have a couple of landing site obliques stowed in the wrong place. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. Is any of those in the Flight Plan? The secondary radiator, for example?
That's affirmative. The secondary radiator leak check is called out in the Flight Plan at 71:20. That procedure is listed in your launch operations book on page 2-9, L2-9. We'd like to change that procedure. Over.
Okay. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Charlie, on the secondary leak check, just read it verbatim like you want, and I'll copy directly into the Flight Plan and not fool around with the checklist.
Roger. That's fine. If you're ready to copy, stand by.
Ready to copy on the leak check.
Roger. It's monitor secondary accumulator quantity. Step 2 is secondary glycol to radiator valve, Normal for 30 seconds, then Bypass. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity - Are you with me?
Yeah, I'm with you.
Okay. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity, secondary glycol to radiator valve to Normal. Next step, secondary coolant loop pump, AC-1 or AC-2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol discharge secondary pressure 39 to 51 psig. Also verify secondary evap out temp has changed. Next step, secondary coolant loop pump, Off. Secondary glycol to radiator valve, Bypass. That ends the procedure. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. I read back: monitor secondary accumulator quantity; secondary glycol radiator valve, Normal for 30 seconds, then to Bypass. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity, secondary glycol to radiator valve to Normal. Secondary coolant loop pump, AC-1 or 2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol secondary discharge pressure 39 to 51 psig. Verify secondary evaporator outlet temp has changed. Secondary coolant loop pump, Off. Secondary glycol radiator valve to Bypass. And what's the reason for the change, Charlie?
Roger. SPAN is concerned that our present procedure as shown in the checklist does not really flow glycol through the radiator, and it - They want to verify that we do not have a plugged secondary radiator. Over.
Okay. They have any abnormal indications in that system, so far?
Negative. This is the procedure that they came up with. It's just a check, Mike. Everything's looking great to us. Over.
Okay. Fine. [Long pause.]
And Charlie, we'll get back with you on these other changes in a few minutes. Okay?
Roger, Neil. No hurry. Over.
11, Houston. We're wondering who's on horn. [Pause.]
Say again, Houston?
We just had a little music there. [Pause.]
We'll keep you entertained. [Pause.]
Rog. That was good. You can keep it coming down, 11.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Because it's a special occasion today, Houston. This is the third anniversary of Gemini 10.
Roger. Happy anniversary.
Thank you, sir.
Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy your update.
Roger. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Okay, Buzz. The first item is that we have indications that your landing site obliques are not in the proper position. If you'll check, we think that the intermediate-scale landing site oblique is stowed in the CSM lunar landmark book. We think that the large-scale landing site oblique is stowed in the back of the LM lunar surface map book. Over. [Long pause.]
I think I heard you Charlie, but I'm not sure that I understand.
Roger. According to our stowage list the - the landing site oblique should be in the transfer bag. In the - But in the backup set of data, the intermediate-scale oblique is in the CSM lunar landmark book, and the large-scale oblique is in the back of the LM lunar surface map book; and that's the reason we think that they might be not where you think they are. Over.
Okay. We've got three obliques. The last one is one I asked for recently. It's just a blow-up of the second one. The first one is one that's got dotted lines on it, indicating horizon view and 50-degree LPD; and all three of those are in the transfer book. Over.
Roger. Fine. We were wrong in our - In our backup set, we had those out of place. Looks like the onboard data's good. We just wanted to let you check on that one. We have an update on the APS/DPS fuel card that you place on the panel. It's a typo error. If you'll break out that little card, we've got the - correct that typo error. Over. [Pause.]
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Okay. I got it.
Rog, Buzz. Under the DPS column on the pressure side, you go down to the fourth item, says pressure greater than 150 PTCA should be greater than 65 percent. Over.
Okay. That's greater than 1.8 for less than 65 and greater than 150 for greater than 65.
That's affirmative. Out.
And we have three items on the mission rules No-Go card, if you're ready to copy those. Over. [Long pause.]
Okay. I've got the mission rules No-Go.
Roger, Buzz. First entry's on the EPS, under AC bus A. The line extends all the way to high gate. Actually, the line should read - at DOI it would be No-Go AC bus A. After that the No-Go would be both buses. So if you will just pencil in both buses from PDI through high gate, it'll be correct for that line. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. I've got that: AC bus A for DOI and both buses NO-GO for PDI on.
That's affirmative up until high gate. You can stop at the line in front of the column 5 minutes to low gate. Now the next line is under the G&C PGNS, pitch and roll GDAs. You can scratch that line completely. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. Got it.
Okay, Buzz. Last entry is down under RCS, and it's a typo error under the three - in the line 'three axis attitude control'. If you proceed to the right at PDI plus 05, you'll see one axis. The line goes all the way to low gate to touchdown. That's incorrect. The line should stop under 5 minutes to low gate. Over. [Long pause.]
Okay. We're stopping that at 5 minutes to low gate.
That's affirm. That completes that card. The rest of the updates are just really for your information based on our 58-hour platform - look at the platform. We're [in] really good shape. Your gyros have almost no drift in them since - prior to the update, we were looking at X of a minus 2.24 MERU, Y of point - plus 0.87, Z of minus 0.11. Since the update, which was based on the 52-hour P52, I believe, we gave you an X drift of plus 0.79, yaw of plus 1.06, Z of plus 0.02 MERU. The difference between the 52-hour and the 57-hour alignments were - did not really give us enough time to get a real good or completely valid update on the drift check. So we're real satisfied with the way the gyros are looking. The PIPAs are looking great also. We are in real good shape with those, too. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Radio check.
Roger. Reading you five-by. How me? Over.
Okay. Loud and clear. You cut out when you were talking about the platform, at something about 52 hours, and after that, we never heard you again.
Roger. I guess we were changing antennas. Stand by. That's affirmative, 11. We were swapping antennas on you down here. Basically the word is we got a real good platform, very small drift on the gyros, and very small drift in the PIPAs. Over.
Roger. Thank you. And I'd like to have a few words of clarification, if you'll give them to me, on the RCS rule. What that change of pitch may mean.
Copy. A few words of clarification on the RCS? Oh, Roger. The - the update there, Neil, you are speaking of about the one axis down to 5 minutes of low gate?
Yeah. That's right. I'm not quite sure what that means - rule means, beyond 5 minutes.
Stand by. I'll make sure I got my story straight with Control. Stand by.
Okay. [Long pause.]
11, Houston. On the RCS, what we are saying is that if we lose control about one axis prior to low gate, we would recommend an abort. This would require a dis - a loss of - of two distinct jets which is not very probable, but that's what we are recommending. After low gate we would continue on. We would recommend that we continue on to attempt a landing. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. I think I understand.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Charlie, did you say you had some updates for me from the lunar surface book?
Apollo 11, say again. You were cut out. Over.
Roger. Did you say you had some updates for us in the lunar surface book. Over.
Negative. At this time, we do not have any updates for the lunar surface book. We wanted you to have it just in case. Over.
Rog. You were cut out that time.
Roger. At the present time, we do not have any updates for you on the lunar surface book. We are thinking about some and kicking them around, but they're very minor changes. Over. [Pause.]
11, Houston. Did you copy that transmission? [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston. We swapped antennas on you again. I say again that we do not have any lunar surface update - book updates at this time. We're considering a few minor ones, but we're still kicking them around the MOCR. Over.
Apollo 11. Uunderstand.
Houston, 11. We have a crew status report for you.
Roger. Go ahead, 11.
Okay. Radiation: CDR, 11009; CMP, 10010; LMP, 09011. No medication.
Roger, 11. We copy for the radiations. And, we're considering - This PTC looks sort of weird to us, so we're considering stopping and starting over again, and we'll be with you in a couple of minutes. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give us the LM/CM Delta-P reading? Over. [Long pause.]
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We switched the antennas on you again. Would you please give us the LM/CM Delta-P reading? Over. [Long pause.]
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
Go ahead. 11 here.
Rog. We switched antennas on you, there, moment ago, Neil. Would you please give us a LM/CM Delta-P reading? Over.
It's less than 0.1.
Roger. [Pause.]
0.15, now, Neil says, Charlie.
Roger. Thank you, Mike. Could you give us some help? This PTC is strange: it's not like anything we've seen before and we were wondering if y'all have had any vents or any idea that could help us out. Over.
I didn't understand that. Say again.
Roger. We're looking at a - sort of a funny looking PTC. We've already drifted out to 70 degrees in pitch and we're wondering if you all have had any vents or any such thing as that, that could have caused us to pick up these rates to drive us off. Over. [Long pause.]
Negative, Charlie. We don't know of anything.
Roger.
Unless it's got something to do with that entry from - start from the position that we want to be in. I don't know.
Roger. When we started off, it looked real fine to us. Now it's drifting off with a funny pattern that we haven't seen previously on a flight. And we're just trying to figure out - I think we'll probably start it over again. We'll be with you momentarily. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. We hate to say it, but we'd like to terminate this PTC and start over again. We have no assurance that we're going to get it through the sleep period with this funny configuration, or funny pattern. We'd like you to stop it now and then go back to pitch 090, yaw 0, and roll - whatever you stop on. Over.
Roger.
11, Houston. We recommend you disable Bravo and Charlie; select quads Alpha and Delta. Over. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 11, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 11, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Do you read? Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Hello, Apollo 11. Over. [Long pause.]
[Garble] Apollo 11. Go ahead.
Rog. Reading you about one-by. Looks like we picked a super attitude here for PTC stabilization. We're reading, you in Backup Voice now. Over.
Roger. We read you loud and clear.
Rog. [Pause.]
Would you like us to pick another antenna?
I think we've got about the best configuration. We've been doing it all from the ground here, 11. We'll just keep it as it is. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Would you select Command Reset and Omni Alpha? Over.
Houston, 11 on Omni Alpha.
Roger. We're reading you about three-by now. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. We is stable; you can start the PTC. Over.
Well, [garble].
Houston, Apollo 11. On checklist page F9-7; I've completed step 8, and I'd like to know what you think is ideal timing between step 8 and step 9 and step 10 on that page? Over.
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. We don't see any time constraint. We'd like you to go ahead and set up the wide deadband then go through step 10 and 11. Over.
Okay. Will do. I don't see any constraint here, Charlie. I was just checking to make sure, because last time, I went from 8 to 9 to 10 to 11 a little bit more swiftly than I'd been doing in the past.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Step 11 complete.
Roger. We copy. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston. Would you please select Omni Bravo? Over.
Roger. Bravo. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 11. How are you reading on Bravo?
Roger. Reading you five-by.
Same here. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston. It looks like we've got a good PTC going. It's good night from the White Team. Over.
Okay. See you tomorrow. Thank you for everything.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
Do you have any idea where the S-IVB is with respect to us?
Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. The S-IVB's about 6,000 nautical miles from you now. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 11. How's the PTC looking?
Stand by. [Long pause.]
11, Houston. The PTC looks great to us. Over.
Okay, do you have any idea what happened to the previous one?
We have absolutely no idea. Over.
Okay. Did, it look like it was all right, then just all of a sudden start diverging?
That's negative, Mike. If you look at the plot, which we'll save for you and let you see it postflight, it's got - it started off immediately on the first rev and just spiraled out to about, oh, 20 to - 20 degrees in pitch, and then it seemed to be setting up a spiral around an offset pitch point of about 20 degrees off from 90 degrees; but we didn't want to take a chance that it would become stable at that point. We thought it might diverge, and so we called you and started over again. Over.
Okay, no complaints. I was just curious as to what had happened.
