Shutdown.
We got 5,337.3, 32.8 feet per second, 60,666.
Eagle. Roger. We copy. It's great. Go.
And we got our residuals.
Okay. Take those out, right?
Yeah
Eagle, Houston. Trim residuals.
We're working on it.
Eagle, Houston. Trim looks good.
check that residual.
That's good.
Eagle, Columbia. You got a solid lock on in VHF ranging and a fresh estimate of R-dot is 480 feet per second.
Okay. That sounds a little on the high side.
Yeah. I'll update it here shortly.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. We show 47.3 by 9.5.
Roger. 47.2 by 9.5.
The AGS has 9.5, 46.6.
Eagle, Houston. Copy.
Okay.
Eagle, Houston. Request abort stage, reset; engine stop, reset; and mode control to Att Hold when you get a chance to.
Roger.
You want to try...?
Yes.
Circuit breakers in - or do you want to go to align?
Maybe we'd better get an alignment...
Okay....
Yes.
Eagle, Houston. You can go ahead and proceed with P52 as per nominal.
Roger, Houston. The Eagle is back in orbit, having left Tranquillity Base and leaving behind a replica from our Apollo 11 patch and the olive branch.
Eagle, Houston. Roger. We copy. The whole world is proud of you.
We had a lot of help down there.
We're going to have to have our rendezvous radar circuit breakers in anyway to get on to your link.
Yes.
Eagle, Columbia. I've got 470 now for R-dot, and I just broke lock. Could you hold silent for a few seconds here while I re-acquire.
Okay.
Okay.
Inverter 2, Inverter 1, circuit breaker open?
Columbia's re-acquired you.
I got Inverter 1.
Close the AOT Lamp circuit breaker -
Going to Track here.
Yes.
That right?
Right.
You know, I didn't see a lot of dust in the cockpit, did you?
No, there was a fair amount. What did you get, 283?
Columbia, Houston. Request P00 and Accept, and we'll give you a good ole LM vector. Over.
Yes.
Roger. Houston. Going to Accept.
Eagle, Houston. You can go ahead and turn your Up-Datalink switch off.
Roger. It's off.
Roger.
Columbia, Houston. The computer is yours. Press on.
Okay.
Houston, the AGS has a Delta-H of 15.5.
Eagle, Houston. Roger. 15.5.
And a maneuver of - and a maneuver of 51.3.
Roger. We copy. And, Eagle, aft Omni. Over.
Roger. Aft Omni.
Columbia, Houston. Eh...
Roger. It's on.
And I can see it reflecting out my window, so it must be working.
Eagle, Houston in the blind. Try low bit rate. Over.
Roger. Low bit rate. I've got a 3.8 signal strength. Over.
Eagle, Houston. Roger. We copy your signal strength, 3.8.
37, I believe.
Get out the chart.
Sounds good, Mike.
Pull that out. Looking for the dot.
Hey Mike,.
I got.
Eagle, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. We saw a very slight jump in cabin and suit pressure there. Could you verify cabin Repress valve is closed?
Okay. It's closed.
Roger. And we've got about 1 minute to before where you ought to be radar tracking, and we've lost data with you.
Okay. Do I to you?
Okay. Get a pass.
Got it? Enter. Seventy six. You got it in the background, huh?.
Eagle, Columbia. You can turn your track light off.
Okay. You got it?
Yes.
All ready to mark, X and Y. Okay. Marked X now.
Houston, Columbia.
X or Y? Maybe you ought to be satisfied with three of them.
Eagle, Columbia. Your track light still on?
Columbia, Houston...
That light is still on.
Say again.
X or Y?
I can't tell.
Okay. Mark Y.
That enough? Beautiful! All zeros. Okay. Let's torque them. I'll write them down. Minus 06, plus 64, plus 137. Torque. Radar circuit breakers in?
I got one mark on your track light and the would drive you right in the center right. Looks like maybe you changed the attitude about that time.
Yeah. We're pointed down pretty much. We're going to be up...
Okay. circuit...
Okay.
breaker in? Both circuit breakers in?
Eagle, Columbia. I got a solid mark on the ranging incorporate one more.
Okay. Auto maneuver.
Okay, I got your track light back. Thank you much.
Columbia, Houston. Did you call?
That's affirmative. I called you before about the VHF ranging. It was not working. reaquired now looking good.
Houston, Eagle. Did you copy our star angle difference and torquing angles.
Eagle, Houston. We didn't have them on the downlink but we copied them on the Vox.
Okay. It was zero for star angle difference, minus 06, plus 64, and plus 1.37. Over.
Eagle, Houston. Roger. We have that.
That's it. Got a good lock-on, Houston.
take that.
How about that?
You really think its apogee is 125 21, huh? That circuit breaker is in.
Engine arm circuit breaker.
Okay. There's a mark. Buy that?
Eagle, Houston. If you have time, pitch 162, yaw minus 16.
You load the REFSMMAT? Okay.
Eagle, Columbia. Your Y-dot is minus 1.0. Over.
Mike, you're.
Eagle, do you read Columbia? Over.
Eagle, this is Columbia. Over.
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Roger, Columbia. Loud and clear now. This is Houston.
Roger. Would you tell Eagle his Y-dot is minus 1.0. Over.
Roger. Eagle, Columbia says your Y-dot is minus 1.0. Over.
Roger, Houston. We got that. Thank you.
Roger. And you can go to high bit rate now - Eagle can.
set up ORDEAL.
Eagle, Columbia. How do you read?
AGS agrees very closely, and pointing direction.
Houston, Columbia is unable to read Eagle on either antenna or on VHF duplex Bravo. You got any suggestions?
Roger, Columbia. We understand you are unable to read Eagle. Stand by.
Houston, tell Columbia that we read him about strength 2.
Okay. Wide deadband on.
Houston, Columbia. Also my VHF ranging is not working now, and I'd like to know whether you'd like me to continue making sextant marks or do nothing. I'm supposed to be doing VHF marks only, and it's for the next 6 or 7 minutes.
Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy. And, Eagle, looks like the best antenna would be forward for the LM. And, break. Eagle, we missed your loading of the TPI TIG and P32. Could you confirm you've done that?
Columbia, Houston. Recommend you take sextant marks and do not re-initialize. Over.
Roger, Houston. Columbia's got the VHF ranging back now. I'll stick with the nominal. Thank you.
Roger. Mighty fine.
Columbia reading you loud and clear now, Eagle.
Columbia, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Mike, you can go ahead and get as many VHF and sextant marks as you can here in this period of time.
Roger that. I've just got time for maybe two sextant marks, then get on with the final count.
Eagle and Columbia, about 1 minute to LOS there on Columbia. It looks like we have about 51.5 for CSI, and we tend to confirm your Y-dot. And, break. For Eagle, verify VHF Bravo transmitter is off.
Roger. VHF Bravo is off.
Eagle, Houston. Recommend aft Omni and are you Go for CSI, so we can let Columbia know. Over.
Roger. We're Go for CSI.
Columbia, Houston. Did you copy? Eagle is Go for CSI.
No, I did not copy. I'm reading them only intermittently, but thank you.
Roger.
Okay.
No. We'll wait until CDH.
Eagle, Houston. We'll see you coming around the other side. Your AOS times are 1 minute ahead of the Flight Plan.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay.
No, I didn't. Go ahead, Mike.
I think we are now, finally, and I think I have you in sight.
We have 51.5.
Well, the ground's got 51.5, and we got 51.5. Yes. First time we've ever agreed on anything.
Want these first?
Not yet.
I don't know why.
I had to turn my S-band off so I could hear him - my S-band switch on the audio panel. Woo-woo!
Yes, that works good.
Not at this point, no.
Okay.
Hey, Mike, how do you read me?
Okay, let's go to B Data on your command.
Eagle, Columbia.
Loud and clear.
Affirmative; we're at the burn attitude, too.
Eagle, Columbia. When you get a chance, could you give me the - the CSI P76 PAD and your Noun 84 and your Noun 33?
Yes, we'll do that in a minute.
Alright.
Okay, Mike, you want the burn time and the Noun 81. Is that right?
Okay, the burn time is 125:19:34.7, and the burn is 51.5, zero, and zero.
Okay, I understand. Plus 51.5, zeros, and zeros, and you're using 125:19:34.70. Thank you kindly.
I'm in maneuver attitude, all set to burn if necessary. I've got about 45 minutes to TIG - 45 seconds to TIG.
Okay.
We're burning, Mike.
Burn complete, Mike.
Good show.
Okay, Mike, our CDH time is 126:17:45.58. Over.
Roger, copy. CDH, 126:17:45.58.
Affirmative.
Eagle, Columbia. I have you in an orbit 49.5 by 46.1.
Okay, thank you.
Eagle, Columbia. I'd like to go back to VHF Ranging configuration, please, on your mark.
Roger. On my mark...
Mark, VHF Ranging.
Well, which way did I go?
out of plane.
What?
Did you hear that?
Why you don't hear these 3 - 3,500-pound rocket engines when you're sitting on them, I'll never know.
Yes.
structure somehow.
3.5, Neil.
Woo-woos is on VHF B...
B?
Not on A.
That's your story, huh?
That's rugged country.
Yes, that perigee we're on.
alright, isn't it?
I got 4 feet forward and I got back 7.
Boy, this water separator sure isn't working worth a durn. Maybe we ought to try the other one - water. Oh boy, this thing is just really spitting it.
I sure do. It's been on - yes, we do - it's been on all the time.
We should see the tracking light now. That's it. Doesn't look but it's not - turned off.
Okay, let's try and get a Y-dot, or an R-dot, at 30 seconds.
It'll be the first time we've ever done it.
No, let me get comm.
We're really going to be crying.
My - top thruster over here has got a lot of brown holes there - in the exit nozzle.
See it?
Yes.
You know, these thrusters aren't used much over here. Well, maybe or something.
See it?
No.
When we get the Sun behind us, we might be able to.
Hey, I got to recycle. Anytime I think. Then after that.
It's all over me.
Coming out of that vent back of my neck, isn't it? That where it's coming out?
Give us the CSI state vector - navigation difference - no updating CSI.
Through AGS.
Thinking about it.
You going to come up with a solution for us?
Range rate?
Range rate.
Went a little higher.
Range/range rate is thirty.
Yaw, damn it!
is up.
125:47:45.58.
feet per second.
Both tanks were pressurized, weren't they?
Yes.
Sure shook them up. I remember that Gene said theirs didn't drop a bit - remember that - when they pressurized? Don't think theirs dropped at all.
Okay.
We're getting minus 2.9.
Going AGS all the way, huh?
Yes, forget it.
Get more tracking if we forget.
No, we'll just - we'll just wait until CDH.
You got a lot of film left in there?
About half.
You could run it some here. Oh, you just - you want to leave some for docking, huh?
Got that cockpit all cleaned up so that we got places for all our trash, Mike?
Yes, we got them all over us - look like chimney sweeps.
You bet you. Nice to get home.
up tracking...
Got that?
What do you need?
That right-angle bracket, the right-angle bracket, need that...
It's not over here. Well, that's a good day not to throw in some failures. See if we can run the nominal one time.
CO2.
I don't think so, Mike, we got to -.
want to go to that -.
Stand by for.
Right, that's what we've got.
Columbia, Houston. Heard you talking to Eagle? I assume you have comm with Eagle now?
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Houston, Columbia in Omni D Delta. Over.
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Columbia, Houston. You're very weak. Say again.
Roger. Houston, Columbia. CSI nominal; no plane change. Everything's going beautifully, and the LM seems to be seeing your laser.
Columbia, Houston. You're about one-by, I could just barely make you out. I can't understand.
Houston, Columbia. How now?
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Houston, this is Eagle. Over.
Hey, Eagle, Houston. Loud and clear. Columbia was very weak. We were unable to read him.
Roger. We saw you come up over the horizon and it looks like you had a laser operating. Could you confirm that?
Eagle, Houston. Stand by. We'll check it. And, Eagle, Houston. Can you give us a burn report?
Roger. Stand by.
Okay. The CSI burn was on scheduled time of 125:19:34.70, 51.5 feet per second was our solution. After chasing residuals a little bit, we ended up with a minus 0.2, plus 0.7, and minus 0.1. And in the AGS, at that time, we had plus 0.4, plus 0.9, and plus 0.3.
Eagle - Eagle, Houston. We copy. Any plane change? Over.
No. There was no plane change on CSI, and CSM had a 2.3 foot per second burn. We had a 2.9, and we elected to postpone that. Over.
Roger. We copy, Eagle. Thank you.
Houston, how do you read Columbia now?
Eagle, how about asking them for some High Gain angles for me, will you, please?
Roger, Houston, do you have some High Gain angles for Columbia? Over.
Roger, Eagle. And, Columbia, stand by. We'll have them for you shortly.
Eagle, Houston. Could you verify you switched lithium hydroxide canisters? Over.
That's affirmative. We started getting an erratic indication on primary, so we switched to secondary, and it was again erratic, and I thought it might have been a sensor. But it's settled down now, and we're on the secondary. Over.
Roger. We copy. Mighty fine.
Columbia and Eagle. Request Omni Delta for Columbia.
Roger, Houston. I've been in Delta the whole time but it doesn't seem to be working.
Houston. Columbia's been on Delta, but he hasn't had much luck with you.
Eagle, Houston. Roger. We copy.
Eagle, are you ready to copy.
Okay, your CDH 45 0.2.
Eagle, Houston. At your convenience, we'd like to go ahead and try your lithium hydroxides on the primary and let us take a look at it down here.
Columbia, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Eagle, Tell them loud and clear since AOS.
Houston, Eagle. Columbia's been reading you loud and clear on his Omnis, but he hasn't had any luck at transmitting to you.
Roger, Eagle. Mighty fine. We don't hear Columbia though.
Okay.
burning at this point?
We're burning ours, Mike. Minus 1.8.
Eagle, Houston. At your convenience.
Columbia, Houston. At your convenience you can go to Reacq on the High Gain, and we should get you.
Columbia, Houston. Over.
Columbia, Houston. You can go ahead and go to Reacq in the High Gain. We should get you then.
Houston
Do you have some angles for him, Houston?
Roger. Pitch minus 30, yaw 180, for Columbia.
Copy. Thank you.
Okay. And what was your CSI - CDH solution, Mike?
44.6. Correction.4 and 14.6. Over.
Rog. Copy. Thanks.
And, Houston, Eagle. Got an ECS light and a CO2 light. Partial pressure's reading about one-half millimeter.
Eagle and Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy.
Houston, how do you read Columbia now?
Columbia, Houston. Go.
Eagle, Houston. We're sure that's a sensor problem. You can leave it on Primary.
Okay.
Roger. We pulled the circuit breaker.
Roger, Eagle.
And our water separator apparently isn't working too well. We're getting a lot of water through the suit loop, and we've changed water separators, but it doesn't seem to have improved the situation any.
Eagle, Houston. Roger. We copy.
Eagle, Columbia. Standing by to back you up on the burn. Just let me know how it's going.
Okay.
Okay. You want to know what our Noun 81 is?
Ready to copy.
Okay. I think you already got the burn time - minus 8.1, minus 1.8, minus 18.2.
Okay. That's pretty close agreement. And, for burn time, I still have 126:17:46.
Rog.
Eagle, Houston. For a warm feeling, we're - we are agreeing with your CDH.
Congratulations.
Unfortunately, the chart doesn't agree with it, because the range-rate at 36 minutes was off the chart.
Thirty seconds.
We're ready to burn.
Okay.
Yeah. I'm ready. Okay.
Burn complete?
Burn complete.
Thank you.
Eagle, Houston. When you get a chance, are your LCGs hooked up? And if so, what does the LCG accumulator show?
Eagle, Columbia. Passing over the Landing Site. It sure is great to look down there and not see you.
Okay.
Eagle, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Did you copy on the LCG, there, and the reading on the water accumulator?
Yeah. Roger. I did. I'm getting.
Houston, the water accumulator is right on the line between the red and the green. Over.
Eagle, Houston. Roger. We copy.
Eagle, Houston.
Houston, Eagle.
Roger. On the water problem there, we can't add anything more to it, except the fact that it looks like the water accumulators are up to speed, to us down here.
Okay. It's not going to be too much trouble.
Roger. Fine.
It's just in one suit, too, for some reason.
Columbia, Houston. Our comm problem was traced to a ground station here.
Okay. Glad to hear it.
Roger. You're mighty fine now.
Range-rate at 30.
I have a TPI TIG when you guys want to compare them.
Stand by.
19.8.
Go ahead, Mike. What have you got?
127:02:34.50.
You're about 32 seconds later than we are.
Okay, fine.
mark and I'll do it.
want to get another I can get a data update in the AGS barely touches.
Mark it. Range.
Mark.
Range rate at 40.
Buzz, I'd like to confirm that your TPI TIG is 127:02:02. Over.
We haven't settled on a final one yet. The last one was - stand by.
Rog. Understand.
Just as soon as you know what TPI TIG's going to be, I'd appreciate a call.
Okay.
Last I got was 32 seconds earlier than mine which would make it 127:02:02.
Thank you. Are you going to be revising that one?
I think probably so. How late - How late can you take a revision?
Well, to stay on my time line, I should have it in the next couple of minutes.
Okay. Latest estimate, 127:03:39.
Thank you kindly.
Eagle, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. In the event of the possibility that we may have had some water channeling in those hydroxide canisters, we recommend you stay in the cabin mode from now on. Over.
Roger.
Eagle, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. I'd better clarify that cabin mode a little bit there. What we mean is you go ahead and stay in the cabin mode. Helmets and gloves on are your option. And we really have no concern with the CO2. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Mike, you already loaded that time? We've got a final one here.
I've already loaded it. I don't think it'll make much difference.
Roger. It's only 9 seconds difference.
Mox nix.
Columbia, Houston.
Columbia. Go ahead.
Roger, Mike. You can go ahead and arm your logic anytime you want to, and we'll give you a Go so that you can hit your Pyro Arm at your convenience.
That's a good idea, babe. You standing by to watch the logic?
Affirmative. Give us a Mark.
Mark, Logic 1.
Mark, Logic 2.
Columbia, Houston. We need the SECS Arm circuit breakers closed.
Okay. Going in SECS Arm Batt A, and Batt B.
Columbia, Houston. Logic looks good. You can arm your Pyros at your convenience.
Thank you.
Eagle, Columbia's starting to maneuver to TPI attitude.
Okay.
Eagle and Columbia, Houston. All your solutions look good to us. Out.
And, Mike, if you want our target Delta-V, I'll give it to you.
Ready to copy.
127:03:30.82, twenty - plus 22.7, plus 1.7, minus 10.6. Over.
127:03:30.82, plus 22.7, plus 1.7, minus 10.6. Thank you.
I'm showing a good bit of out-of-plane velocity on my cross-pointers, Mike.
Rog. I have no indication of it.
Coming up on 1 minute to TIG, Neil. How's it looking?
Pretty good.
Good.
That out-of-plane was in the AGS, not in the radar.
Roger that.
Okay.
Ready to burn?
Okay.
We're burning.
Atta-boy!
Okay, that's it.
Burn complete?
Burn's complete. Did you...
Roger. Thank you.
Eagle, Houston. Aft Omni, low-bit rate, and we'll see you at 127 plus 51.
Okay, 5, huh?
Well - say when Oh, wait a minute.
Chart at 26/7 forward for...
Pretty reasonable.
AGS had these residuals after its completion after the burn.
I can't see you, Michael.
You're moving in at, uh, I've got -ty seventy-six.
Okay. I got good radar. I just can't see you.
Do you think that pressure dropped?
Yes.
It doesn't show up in the books. I don't see any reason why we don't take them all back. All that we've got.
All got data.
We all got something.
Okay, you try getting it -?
No, I haven't been. Do you want me to?
No, I got to keep the chart.
can take this update for them.
On the track about, huh?
Boy, my shoulders are hurting.
Mine are, too.
Last night I couldn't get this far from the.
I was the same way.
Use all the green tape, did you?
I got it in sight now, Mike.
Okay.
(Yawn)
Yes, so do we.
A hundred and what?
Okay, Noun 81, minus 0, plus 0.4, plus 0.9.
And now, plus 0.4, plus 0.9.
And 15 minutes after TPI, I've got...
M-1.
your burn's a little late.
be burning -.
Okay, the on? There it is.
Neil, I guarantee you that the burn is precise, okay?
Good.
good burn.
No, it's not going to be late. Maybe 5 seconds.
Burn complete.
Thank you.
Well, it's all over but the docking.
Check the start out there.
Okay.
You still got him?
Yes. I probably won't when the sun gets in my telescope.
Now I can't see...
The what?
Won't hold the.
You're coming right down the path, and it sure has been nice.
Okay. I just got sight of you in the sunlight here.
Okay.
Oh, I've got him.
I've got him now, too.
Sure enough.
Well, I see you don't have any landing gear.
That's good.
You're not confused on which end to dock with, are you?
Okay, Mike, if there's some data bags around there - I may have one or two in my temporary stowage - why, we may want them in addition to the other regular bags, so we can put some of this data back in it.
In the data bags?
Yes, there are a couple of different LM bags that I left in there.
Okay, well, why don't we back over there and?
Right.
bring the bag.
Could be.
Alright.
Okay, have a plastic one and a.
Bring the back.
I think we'll make it.
Don't tell that to poor, though (laughter).
We'll see you at 24.
Okay.
One of those two bright spots is bound to be Mike.
How about picking the closest one?
Good idea.
this light?
Is that alright?
Okay, at 49,000 feet, we're supposed to be 65 feet per second - our little old chart says. And our LOS rate's supposed to be about 0.1. It's about point...
Okay.
Right - that's.
12 on here, right?
Not exactly.
Not exactly?
You're a little less. You're 10 seconds less in. About that.
Look's like you're making a high on us, Michael.
Yes,.
let me move in just a.
No, we aren't that - confident.
We've got about 54.
You got to?
Huh?
The?
Yes..
Let's try this midcourse out.
Right. Okay, it's.
Is that right, I hope?
Yes.
It should be 70.
Okay, I can see the shape of your vehicle now, Mike.
Oh, yes - got your High Gain in sight, your tracking light - whole vehicle shows. I see that you're pointed at me. Now, you're turning a little bit - great.
Are you burning yet?
We're burning.
Good enough.
Seems like when you get down to around 110, you just keep chasing him. You put it in - stick it in one axis, and it goes through - out of another, especially when stays about the same.
If it's, it's definite.
Okay, now, let's see. We want to change the DAP - that what we want to do?
Yes.
I need a P76 now, Buzz.
Okay, you got the time for the burn. Noun 81 was plus 0.1, plus 1.2, plus 0.5.
plus.
Okay. 45...
8.2 miles, 40 feet per second.
You can have your place now.
Okay.
Can you see our tracking light, now?
Not yet, but you're in between my sextant and my COAS.
Where'd you put the?
My what?
Your for.
It's in the bottom overshoot box.
pick me up.
I got you.
Okay. Don't other spacecraft.
No, I'm not going to lose you, brother.
What have you got for? I have 6.8 and 9 miles, out. Oh, that checks.
Got up? I thought I made it pretty clear.
Not as sporty a as we thought, huh?
That wasn't - bad at all. The alignment was - pretty dicey.
Yes, sir.
That was just luck.
I hope you.
I'll be glad to get to the.
Yes, but I hate to; will you get?
Okay.
Oh, it'll come off, I guess -.
These screws here...
Alright, there's a couple of bolts...
these screws here might do it.
there's a couple of bolts down there that have come loose - if I remember. I'll get them.
I'm slowly closing at 32 feet per second and a mile-and-a-half.
Okay, I've got a mile-and-a-half and 32½.
Take.
Yes, I guess it'll take us another - 6 minutes or something like that.
Yes.
we got 15.
Okay.
That's going to hit the braking gate right on the schedule.
Yes.
Okay, let's put P47 in.
I don't know why I lost my - I'm at - oh, did you - you lost your transponder, Mike - I think.
pitch up a bit.
I wish you would.
I have 0.7 mile and I got you at 31 feet per second, look good.
Okay,.
Okay, we're getting it.
Are you forward now?
Yes - yes, we're in good shape, Mike. We're braking.
Okay.
Flying all over us.
Okay, we're about 11 feet a second coming in at you.
That's good. What are you in?
Hope we're not going to get a pitch straight down.
We've got a - pitchdown and then a yaw to do...
Looks good.
I'm sure you're going to get, I'll tell you that.
It flies good, though.
Okay, now, if I pitch over, I'm going to be looking right into the Sun.
Hope you know how to roll.
Yes, I do. I.
You want to end up with that window - opposite his right window so you don't want to roll right. Right?
Yes.
The only trouble is, it's towards - towards 90, isn't it?
You could - you...
If I roll 120 - it'll roll left
90, huh? 60?
Well, why don't I start to roll...
Yes, I think if you roll up 60...
I'll be looking into his left window when I pitch up.
I don't think so. If you did it right now you'd...
I got the Earth coming up already. It's fantastic!
Okay. You've got me.
Eagle and Columbia, Houston. Standing by.
Roger. We're station-keeping.
Roger.
Pitch up then when we translate up just a little, you got a better view - bottom side - - move back.
that's right.
Okay. I'm getting about into the right attitude, I think..
Yes.
That roll's pretty far. I don't know just how much - so that's - Oh, it's going to go gimbal lock!
That's it - going to AGS?
Yes, Att Deadband.
Okay, Mike, I'll get - try to get in position here, and then you got it.
Okay.
How does the roll attitude look?
Let's see how the DSKY thinks it looks.
Have you stopped rolling yet?
I'll stop. Matter of fact, I can stop right here, if you like that.
Need a little bit more. That's the way, keep it going. Need a little more. That's the way, keep going - go a little bit more - go ahead - go ahead - okay, stop. Okay, I got it now.
You got the in?
Yes. Right there. Okay, I...
Well, we might need to at least have a platform.
Yes.
Okay, now, Neil, when you feel us contact, you're going to turn seconds, is that right?
Eagle, Houston. Middle gimbal. And you might pass to Columbia, we don't have him yet.
That's right.
Okay, Buzz.
We got a platform to make.
Okay.
I'm not going to do a thing, Mike. I'm just letting her hold in Attitude Hold.
Okay.
I think we ought to be at 4 jets for this, AGS.
Hold.
He's about 15 feet out now.
Okay, I'd better try out the radar.
Don't you want to beef up that radar?
Yes.
Good.
Ready to pull the circuit breakers?
Okay. You ready?
Yes.
They're pulled.
He's 10 feet. About 5 feet, I guess.
Looks good, Mike.
Okay, they're pulled.
Pull it out.
Okay. Circuit breakers...
You gray?
Okay.
Go ahead.
Okay. We're all yours, Columbia.
Okay. Okay, I have thrusters B3 and C4 safetied.
Okay.
I'm pumping up cabin pressure.
That was a funny one, you know. I didn't - I didn't feel a shock, and I thought things were pretty steady. I went to Retract there, and that's when all hell broke loose. Were you guys - did it appear to you to be - that you were jerking around quite a bit during the retract cycle?
Ah yeah. It seemed to happen at the time I put the plus-X thrust to it, and apparently it wasn't centered, because somehow or other I accidentally got off in attitude and then the attitude hold system started firing.
Yeah. I was sure busy there for a couple of seconds.
Are you hearing me all right? I got a horrible squeal.
Yeah. I agree with that, but we hear you okay.
