It's nice and quiet over here, isn't it?
Eagle, you read Columbia?
Roger. Loud and clear.
Okay, everything's going well. Everything's quiet over on this side.
You bet.
Okay. I'm standing by to record your data any time it's convenient for you. Angles coming up in another 2 minutes.
Okay, I'm ready to go to B-Data now.
Roger and out.
Columbia, Eagle. How do you read?
Read you loud and clear, Buzz.
Very good.
Mike, are you in AGS Cal attitude now?
That's affirm. I'm holding you there with the DAP, getting the deadband. When you get ready to do the AGS Cal, I will sort of quiet down the thruster firing and then hope to stop it altogether, but I don't even think that'll get it.
Okay. Well, I'm just about ready to do that. Whenever you're ready to let it go free, why just tell me.
Okay, it looks real quiet now. I'm ready to go right now.
Buzz, you copy?
Buzz, you copy?
Okay, Mike. Thanks.
Now, might check me on this, I - it's - I'm ready to go any time you're ready.
Roger. We'll be ready to go in just a minute.
Okay, I'm starting my 5-minute rate - right now.
As a matter of interest, I appear to be drifting in my roll. I'm holding my pitch and yaw pretty constant, and I'm staying a good 15 degrees late in the program.
Roger.
Looks like a.
Halfway through it, it looks like I have degrees in roll is about all.
Yes, those look like good ones right now.
Mike, what's your Sep time?
A few minutes.
GET of the separation burn is 100:39:50 even.
I haven't gotten the updates for undocking time; I'm still carrying 100 hours 15 minutes, I guess,.
I'm surprised they didn't update it by 3 or 4 minutes to, you know, make that Delta-V be in the same position that they wanted.
Yes, I agree.
So we're about 3 minutes ahead of the printed Flight Plan. It might be wise to try to Sep about 3 minutes early, and we can give them a GET of Sep that's precise, whenever they want it.
I have 5 minutes and 15 seconds since we started. Attitude is holding very well.
Roger, Mike. Just hold it a little bit longer.
No sweat, I can hold it all day. Take your sweet time. How's the Czar over there? He's so quiet.
Just hanging on - and punching.
I didn't know radio. I've ever seen a radio. All I can say is, "Beware the revolution."
You cats take it easy on the lunar surface. If I hear you huffing and puffing, I'm going to start bitching at you.
Okay, Mike.
I just pressurized the DPS. looks okay, Mike.
Roger that.
Hey, Mike, can you see where our radar's pointing now?
Well, it looks like it's pointed right at my head - that's hard south. So's your radio beacon.
Okay. It should really - it should be pointing from the - you know, our forward axis? It should be pointing up at 40 degrees and, you know...
Okay. We've wandered back over the bellyband now - let me assure that AGS Cal.
How'd the AGS Cal work out?
Oh, it danced around a little bit, but seemed to go right back to the original numbers.
Okay. I'm going to start a maneuver now to our undocking attitude.
Now the undock attitude and the SEP attitude ought to be the same, so I'm going to go to what they gave me for the updated separation burn attitude. That's just about 7 degrees off, but it's in your Flight Plan for the undock attitude.
Okay.
When your rendezvous radar self-test is complete, let me know and I'll check out my transponder.
Excuse me, Mike, what did you say?
I say, when your rendezvous radar self-test is complete, let me know and I'll check out my transponder.
Yes, we're through with that now.
Thank you. I'm maneuvering the.
That transponder checked out. I hope they've got a nice, big, strong for you.
Very good.
Hey, Mike, what would you recommend as a good setting on the 16 millimeter?
Well, what they recommend for you is f:8 at 1/250th and put it not on infinity, but on 7 feet, which covers all the way from infinity down to a very short distance to keep it in focus, and 6 frames per second, I guess.
Yes, what you say, f:8 at 1/250th?
Yes, f:8 at l/250th. And after you get it all set up, check that f-stop again because it slides and slips off with very little twist.
How about using, as an undocking time, 100 hours and 12 minutes? That suit your fancy?
That'll be fine.
Okay.
What have you got for AOS, Mike?
I have 100 hours and 16 minutes.
Okay.
We got just about a minute to go. You guys all set?
Yes, I think we're about ready.
We're all set when you are, Mike.
15 seconds.
Okay, there you go. Beautiful!
Looks like a good Sep.
Looks good to me.
Okay. I've killed my rate, Mike, so you drift out to the distance you like and then stop your rate.
Starting my yaw.
There's sure a better visual in the simulator.
Okay. I picked up a little roll. I'm going to get rid of it.
Okay with you if I start my pitch, or you think you're not far enough away yet, Mike?
I'd prefer you stand by just a couple of seconds, Neil.
Okay. I'll wait for when you're ready - when you think you've got your rates killed perfectly.
Okay. I'm still holding.
Okay, looks pretty good to me now.
Okay.
Just like in the simulator, you're drifting off to one side and down below a little bit.
Yes.
Hello, Eagle. Houston. We're standing by. Over.
The gear are looking good. I've seen three of them.
The MESA is not down, right?
Say again.
The MESA's still up?
Yes.
Good.
Now, you're looking good.
Eagle, Houston. We - Houston. We see you on the steerable. Over.
Roger. Eagle's undocked.
Roger. How does it look, Neil?
The Eagle has wings.
Rog.
Looking good.
Roger, Neil. We got a - If you'll give us P00 and Data, we've got some loads for you.
Okay. You've got it. P00 and Data.
Roger. Let us know when you're ready to copy. We have a DOI PAD, the - and the PDI PAD. Over.
You check our tracking light, Mike?
It came on.
Camera's working beautifully.
Track off?
It's off.
Okay, I'm ready to start my yaw maneuver if it suits you, Mike.
Does it look like you're gonna be able to do this without burning thrusters, Mike?
I'd have to fire laterally once or twice.
Very small.
Go ahead, Houston. Eagle is ready to copy.
Roger, Eagle. Coming at you with a DOI PAD: 101:36:14.07. Noun 81, minus 00758, plus all balls, plus 00098, plus - correction, 00572, perigee plus 00085 00764 030 000 293.

Roger. Good readback, Buzz. Out.
Neil, I'm maneuvering in roll.
Rog. I see you.
Houston, Eagle. Are you copying the fairly large numbers for range and range rate in - Verb 83? And did - did you just give us a state vector that changed one of the two vehicles? Over.
Roger, Eagle. We gave you a LM state vector. We have not changed the CSM state vector, however. Over.
Okay. That explains the difference.
Columbia, Houston. On my Mark, 9:30 to ignition.
Mark.
9:30.
Eagle, Houston. Would you have Columbia go to the High Gain, yaw 0, pitch minus 20. Over. [Pause.
You want him to go to High Gain, yaw, zero, ah - say again the numbers.
Rog, Neil. Yaw 0, pitch minus 20, High Gain angles. Over.
Okay. Yaw zero, pitch minus 20, on the High Gain.
That's affirmative. We've lost all data with him.
Yes, I copy that, and I'll do it just as soon as I get to it.
To Columbia?
Okay, he says he'll do that as soon as he gets around there.
Rog.
Okay, Neil, I'm all set for the Sep burn, and we're looking good on this phasing.
Okay.
Columbia, Houston. How do you read?
Columbia reading you loud and clear, Houston. How me?
Roger, Mike. Five-by. On my mark, 7 minutes 'til ignition.
Mark.
Seven minutes.
I agree. Everything's looking real good.
Apollo 11, Houston. You are looking good for separation. You are Go for separation, Columbia. Over.
Columbia understands.
We're really stabilized, Neil. I haven't fired a thruster in 5 minutes.
I'll make a small trim maneuver?
Mike, what's going to be your pitch angle at Sep?
007 degrees.
Okay.
Is that close enough for you, or do you want it to a couple of decimal places?
No. That's good.
I think you've got a fine looking flying machine there, Eagle, despite the fact you're upside down.
Somebody's upside down.
There you go. One minute 'til TIG. You guys take care.
See you later.
Thrusting.
Houston, Columbia. My DSKY is reading 4.9 in X, 5.0 make it, and EMS 105.4. Over.
Roger. Copy. Columbia, it looks good to us. Over.
Thanks.
Columbia, Houston. We'd like you to terminate average G. Over.
Roger. In P00.
You're going right down US-1, Mike.
Eagle, Columbia. At your convenience, I'd like to switch over to VHF ranging mode.
Roger. Let's go to VHF ranging now.
Okay.
Mark.
Eagle, Columbia. I'm reading you loud and scratchy. Neil is not coming through too well on his VOX. Could you stay quiet for 15 seconds while I get this locked on.
Okay.
I've got a solid lock on. I have you at 0.27 miles.
Eagle, Houston. We've got a state vector for you. We'd like P00 and Data. Over.
You have it.
Thank you, sir.

Good readback. Out.
Okay.
Eagle, Houston. When you're ready to copy, I have a lunar surface data PAD for you. Over.
Roger. Stand by.
We've got the load in, Eagle. You can go back Up-data link Off. Over.
Roger.
Columbia, Houston. At your convenience we'd like P00 and Accept. We have a couple of state vectors for you. Over.
Okay. Going to P00 and Accept, and I just got some unexplained roll thruster activity. I might have bumped the hand controller.
Roger. We'll look at it. Out
You might look at those systems...
And Eagle is ready to copy lunar surface data card.
Rog, Buzz. Starting with the T-2; T-2 TIG, 102:54:29.00, 103:51:56.00, 106:37:35.00, 109:10:00.00. In the remarks: T-2 occurs at PDI plus 21:26. T-3 time - correction T-3, T-3 TIG: 104:39:41.00, 001:58:15.00, 001:58:54.00. Noun 11: 105:36:23.00, 107:11:30.00. Ready for your readback. Over.

Rog. Good readback, Eagle. Out.
Would you put your tracking light on, please?
It's on, Mike.
Thank you.
Columbia, Houston. We got the load in. You can go back to Block. Over.
Is that for Columbia?
That's affirmative, Columbia.
Okay. Thank you, Houston.
Mike, you want to give us a Mark when you're right at 7 miles - I mean seven-tenths of a mile?
Will do.
Okay. We just got seven-tenths on the radar.
Mark.
Yeah. I'm oscillating between 0.69 and seven-tenths.
Very good. We've got 4,200 on the tapemeter.
I'm steady on 0.70 now. Yeah. I read you sort of scratchy, but I read you.
Houston, Apollo - or Houston, Columbia. Over.
Roger. Go, Columbia. Over.
Rog. I still need a DOI P76 PAD, and a PDI-1 plus 12 P76 PAD, some time at your convenience.
Roger. Stand by.
Columbia, Houston. DOI P76 PAD, if you're ready to copy. Over.
Ready to copy.

Columbia, Houston. We'd like you to turn off your Rotational direct - Rotational Control Power Direct number 2, Off. Over.
It's Off. Thank you.
Columbia, Houston. On those P76s, a friendly reminder from your FIDO: add half the burn time to the TIG. Over.
Roger.
Columbia, Houston. We've lost data with Eagle. Will you please have him select aft Omni? Over.
Eagle, this is Columbia. Houston would like you to select aft Omni.
Rog. I got it now. Houston, you reading Eagle now on aft Omni?
That's affirmative, Eagle. Reading you five-by.
Roger.
Columbia, Houston. We'll have LOS at 101:28. AOS for you, 102:15. Over.
Thank you.
Eagle, Houston. It appeared to us when you're doing the P52, maneuvering, the S-band - the High Gain went into the stop. Verify that both S-band breakers are in. Over.
Rog. I think I'd got it to 90.0 before it went there. The one on this side is in, and I'll check the other later.
Okay. Thank you, Buzz.
Eagle, Houston. You are Go for DOI. Over.
Roger. Go for DOI. Do you have LOS and AOS times?
Roger. For you, LOS at 101:28. AOS, 102:16. Over.
Roger. Copy.
And, Buzz, S-band steerable update for you on the angles at AOS: 219 and yaw 30. Over.
Rog. That's in the Flight Plan. Thank you.
Houston, Columbia. How are all the systems looking?
Say again, Over.
Just wanted to get a systems check from you sometime prior to LOS.
Roger.
Houston, Eagle. You - Our torquing angles, Noun 93, on four zeros and a 3 are minus 00292, plus 00289, minus 00094.
Roger. Copy. Stand by. Roger, Eagle. You can torque it. Over.

Columbia/Eagle, Houston. Three minutes to LOS. Both looking good going over the hill.
Columbia. Rog.
Eagle. Rog.
Burn time, 30 seconds.
Okay, state vector looks relatively good.
Mike, how do you read?
Columbia, Eagle. How do you read?
Very good. How do you read me?
Very good. If you are ready, give the mark and we'll go to B-Data. Over.
Stand by one. I'm.
Are you?
63.
they look good.
Okay, let's switch to B-Data now.
Okay.
Eagle, Columbia.
Go ahead.
Columbia's.
Eagle, Columbia. How's it going?
Mike, the burn's complete. It was on time - residuals are nulled, and AGS's free.
Beautiful.
Eagle, Columbia.
Go ahead.
Roger. I'm ready to go back to VHF Ranging configuration. Be alright?
Roger. Let's go now to VHF Ranging.
Over and out.
Okay.
And you got Verb 76 in?
Yes, 76 is in locked up.
And we're 7.5.
Roger. That's just what we got, 7.6.
Okay.
P00?
8 minutes...
We're in good shape...
coming up on 8 minutes.
for...
High Bit, 8 minutes.
You don't have an 8-minute mark.
67 feet per second. Go ahead with the.
Can't beat that. Okay, through with that?
Yep. I like it.
Hold on to the below.
Okay. And I'll pull the breakers - think we can roll.
Yeah.
Got them both?
What?
Got them both?
Yes.
Okay, it.
Going to load the PDI plus 12, right?
Right.
Okay. I'm going to start pitching down to 125.
No PDI plus 12.
I have you right down 65 feet per second.
Sounds good.
Okay, the camera is set. And ought to be ready to do the P52.
Yes.
Not going to be much of a drift check.
It - it torques them late enough to ensure that - the drift check.
Sure seems like we're going the wrong way.
How much do we got to go to pick it up?
Got to go - oh, half the Moon to go, I guess.
Coming down already.
Okay. It's got us 152. It's 151, there's, okay?
There's 52.
Got 8 minutes.
Now we can let us take - let it take us there.
No, wait. Don't do that.
Why not?
I have to roll.
Yes, that's right.
In 2 more minutes.
Well, I did attitude.
Yes, you'll have to roll over. Well, I guess I might as well do that.
Where's your watch? Got your stopwatch?
Got it in my pocket.
Well, the us over, huh?
And, one thing I'd appreciate if you could - see if you could - find the...
What?
The map.
Yes. Which one do you want? I've got...
That it? Where do you want it?
Trade you that for a piece of gum. There it is.
When do we have to get these? Alright, go on.
What do you mean by bringing - bringing CSM trash in here?
Well, that's stuff I had left over in my pocket.
You want?
Screen.
You in Auto?
No, I'm not Auto. I'll be there in just a minute.
312, it likes.
Well, we ought to proceed on that for a while.
Okay.
These clocks you can't move like you can some. Let me try and get that clock set for PDI. 33.
updates.
Yes, we're keeping busy down here.
Okay.
Can't change this thing, once it gets going; like in the middle of a...
You can't?
No.
PGNS Mode Control in Auto.
Okay. Well, I can - the radar antenna.
No, that's the wrong circuit - that's.
There's the Sun in the COAS.
In the COAS?
In the - I mean, in the reticle.
Alright, let me - let me do my rain dance with the DSKY here.
Okay.
Got it on?
Now I need a Verb 76. I'm right on in pitch.
You want a Verb 76? Okay, you got it.
Hmm.
How are you doing - you going to be about ready to mark?
Yes.
Say, how about you remembering the number that I read to you. Don't have to write it down. Roll right just a little.
Just about ready to mark.
Go ahead.
Oh, this cotton picking - thought I was.
Give me a check.
Ready?
Getting close.
Okay.
Ready?
Yes.
Mark it.
124 19, 124 19. Well, it should have been - 124 00.
Do another one?
Yes.
Okay. I'm about ready.
Tell me when.
Ready...
Mark it.
Okay. 134 17, Key Release, Proceed. it should have been - 124 01. One more. Getting closer.
Ready whenever you are.
Stand by. How's our roll?
Okay.
Mark it.
Okay, 13; Key Release; Proceed. 413 - it should have been - closer yet.
Okay, Mike, we passed the star check. Foxtrot.
Very good.
Very good. Okay?
Alright, let's go to - pitch to 180, 285, and zero.
Okay. We'll.
Cotton picker just won't stay - try it!
Well, wait until we lose that descent stage, man.
We'd better take - a - piece of tape. Hold that down.
How about if you get the bottom in the - get the bottom underneath this cover? That help?
Well, it - it's still not. I've had it in there real good a couple of times.
Your - hoses are tearing hell out of my board.
Sorry.
You got Inverter 1 circuit breaker in, right?
Checked in.
Okay. I'm going to check Inverter 1. Inverter 2 is good; and Inverter 1 is good, and we're on Inverter 1.
look good.
Okay, get your AELD circuit breaker in and Abort Stage circuit breaker in.
AELD is in. Abort Stage is in.
Cycle the CWEA? No, we must have lost one.
Yep. That cottonpicker may be trouble.
Well, we'll have to tell them about that. I don't know when it - when it went out, because we didn't get any light that I saw, did you?
I think it's just a switch. I if it doesn't trigger a light...
Something...
Oh, we're in Pulse, and we're not commanding any firing...
I don't know. That could have come under DOI, but I doubt it.
I just think that's one of those sticky flags. got a good engine.
Alright, let's see.
Engine Stop button was reset?
Engine Stop button is Start, but it is going to be now.
Alright. Window bars. Throttle Control to Auto.
Okay. Throttle Control to Auto.
Alright, TTCA...
Throttle on Minimum.
Enable - Enable - Throttle in Minimum. Okay, in 35 minutes, we'll get the BAT feeds On and...
That's the wrong time, right?
No, no, no.
PDI?
It's - oh - about - probably maybe a second, right here, 32. Okay?
Yes, it's about a second off.
If it's fast, I'll stop it. If it isn't, why, forget it.
You want this one over there?
I need this out. Burn in 46 minutes.
You want this one?
Yes. I don't - think - it'll be helpful, but I'll stick it here and pull it out if I need it.
Let's see. We haven't got P20 going yet, have we?
No.
Let's do that. Let's get the Rendezvous Radar circuit breaker in.
Okay.
In. Might look at the DPS.
What do you hear?
glycol pumps.
Alright.
Look at that. Oh, that must have been -.
Okay, ascent - tank pressure - temperature's up, changed to - I don't know.
DPS's good...
Look at all that RCS we got.
That's more than we've ever had in the simulator, isn't it?
Yes.
Got your camera rigged?
The other circuit breaker? Camera's all set to go. I hope the others just don't fall out. Got them both in?
Yes.
Well, let's hope he's in Mode 2.
Okay, I'm going to get the Ascent Batts, On. Battery 5, On, looks good. Battery 6, On, that's good.
Yes, we've lost it.
Well, did it go to Mode 2? That's where I want it to go.
No - I can't tell.
Yes, it's going to Mode 2. Hasn't it?
Yes.
Yes. There we are. Beautiful.
Go to Auto Track?
No, not yet - wait until the light goes out. Did that thing want to - Hey, I didn't know that could do that. You don't hear that, huh? (Laughter)
Hear that, too, huh?
Sounds like wind whipping around the trees.
Okay, Auto Track.
Okay, we ready to go to P63?
Yes.
Okay, get a - get a - Need to compare a TIG time. 09:50. That's right.
See that Big Dipper there?
That's a big out of plane, but I don't know which way it is.
I believe minus - but they were expecting it.
