Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're standing by. Over.
Do you want to talk to them?
Roger, Houston. Burn status report follows: Delta-TIG. zero; burn time, 17; angle through the pad values, Delta-VGX was plus 0.3...
VGY minus 0.0, VGZ minus 0.1, Delta-VC minus 5.2, fuel 362, Ox 364, unbalance plus 50, and our postburn Noun 94's, 66.1 by 54.4. Go ahead.
Roger. We copy, Neil. Would you say again the Delta-VZ? We missed that. Over.
Roger. That was minus 0.1.
Roger. Copy the burn report. Sounds good.
It all looked good up here.
Apollo 11, Houston. We missed your Delta-TIG and also your Delta Burn Time. Over.
Delta-TIG was zero and the burn time was 17 seconds.
Copy 17.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'll be satisfied if you pump up the cabin to 5.4. Over.
Okay. We're showing about 5.2 right now.
Roger.
And, Charlie, the LM/CM Delta-P is just over 1 pound right now.
Copy. Out.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. If you read, please attempt to acquire on the High Gain. We're having trouble locking up on the TM and we have no voice. Over.
Hello, Apollo 11...
Houston, Apollo 11.
Roger. We're reading you five-by. Go ahead. Over.
Roger. We have you on High Gain now.
Rog. We lost the TM and the voice for about 5 minutes here. We were - attempted a handover and fouled it up in some manner, but we got you back now. Thank you much.
Okay. We're pressurizing the LM at this time.
Copy.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have a P22 Auto optics update for you, if you're ready to copy. Over.
Ready to copy.
Rog, Mike. It's landmark Alpha 1: T1, 82:37:35; T2, 82:42:50. We're 7 miles north. Over.
Copy. P22. T1 time, 82:37:35; T2, 82:42:50. And the target is 7 miles north. Thank you.
Rog.
I get the distinct impression, Charlie, that mare surface laps up over the edge of the mountains at the shoreline.
Roger. We copy.
Houston. On your comment about the mare lapping up to the terrain - mountainous terrain, is that an impression like a lava flow coming in around a prominence, Neil, or is it more - looks like it's sloping up at that point? Over.
It isn't true everywhere, but there's certainly places where there seems to be a slope downward towards the shoreline on the mare. In other words, from the mare down to the shoreline is a downward slope indicating that it might be a lava front.
Roger.
Crossing Duke Island and Maskelyne W.
Say again, Neil. Over.
We just crossed Duke Island and Maskelyne W.
Ah, Rog.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're wondering if you've started into the LM yet. Over.
We have the CSM hatch out, the drogue and probe removed and stowed, and we're just about ready to open the LM hatch now.
Roger. Thank you much, Neil. We'll be standing by.
Okay, Charlie. We're in the LM. The docking index mark is the same.
Roger. We copy.
Charlie, there just doesn't seem to be any slow way to get that Repress to Auto without making a big bang.
Apollo 11, Houston. Say again. Over.
Roger. There just doesn't seem to be any slow way to get the Repress from Closed to Auto and avoid a big bang. Over.
Oh, we copy, Buzz. Thank you much. Out.
We concur with that, Buzz.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'll have LOS 81:45, next AOS - Stand by.
Next AOS 82:32. Over.
Okay. 82:32.
Houston, Apollo 11. I'm going to start a maneuver to P22 attitude at this time.
11. Roger. We copy. Over.
Okay. We're noticing some water inside the Command Module for the first time. There's a little puddle of it on the aft bulkhead sort of like 101 had.
Roger.
I'd like to know how EECOM wants to get rid of it. There are a number of different ways and what does he think is the best one?
We'll be with you in a moment, Mike. Stand by.
No big rush. It'll wait until the next rev or two.
All right.
Well, they look like they were made to go. That's - that's it, isn't it? Weren't they made to put here so you stow them by putting them on here instead of the way we do it?
Then we only have to decide what - what's supposed to go here.
I two of them.
Both of those - those things are in here.
worry about nothing goes in there.
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We've played back the LOI-2 burn. It looked really good to us. The systems were all good. We got an orbit on the limited amount of tracking at 65.4 by a 53.9. Over.
Sounds good, Houston.
I need that film now.
Okay.
Okay, want to get film. It's a long trip to the film container.
You want something?
Oh, shoot. I'm going to have trouble getting in there.
How's it going, Neil? You getting any?
Well - Buzz, the 70-millimeter container's only got one black and white and one color in it - Isn't it supposed to...
That's - that's not - that's mine.
You've got the wrong one.
No, that's not the right one.
The one...
The one you want, Neil, is way over here in - R-13.
No, it's not in there. It was on my girth shelf.
Okay.
Oh, okay, there it is. Did you get that one put back?
No, but I will.
Okay, appreciate it. I had it in my mind that - our...
You want to do something to the polarizing filter, Neil?
Uh...
I'll stick it up there on the ceiling. There's a...
not really.
we got room for it up there.
You want the 16-millimeter while you're down here, Neil?
Yes.
The 16-millimeter bag as well?
Yes, I'll take that one, too.
Okay.
Well, that - damn stuff won't stick. Haven't got a piece of Velcro on there yet.
You're not.
Man, can't you stop some of that racket up there?
Huh?
That's the S-band - you turn your volumes down.
Is that better on the S-band?
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
There's one that's got mission rules in it - but I can't place - at the moment, put my hands on it..
It's a No-Go - Go/No-Go - the one - one I'm looking for. Hey, that's beautiful.
Like this?
Yes.
That's the one we made the changes in, right?
Right.
It may be up in the - in the Command Module, huh? Have you got another clip?
For the window?
I thought we might just stick my - activation checklist right - right there, and we'll be all ready coming in.
Right here?
Yes..
We may be ending up with one more than we're authorized - one, two, three, four, five. Yes, one of these will be changed over to - As a matter of fact, I stole one from Mike - but one of them we'll change over to the...
I'll go check around up here.
Oh, wait a minute, here it is. I got it.
I don't think the...
This other one got changed.
No, it didn't.
You want to do that?
Yes, I can do that.
And in the meantime - Let's see, where'd the film go?
Now, the thing that would be nice to find out is if - how well - go - the 80-millimeter - with the film pack on it - in color.
You do put these in with this dark slide in, don't you? Is that right?
Which one you got? 60? 60 you do, and the 80 you -.
Yes, dark slide in.
It'll lock it the other way. That - that side - it'll pull it closed.
Alright. for telling me.
Boy, that thing goes all over, doesn't it? Maybe we ought to - do these the other way around.
Neil, we got two magazines, two color, A... - one of them is R and the other is S.
Yes.
I'm going to put the R in the reserve camera.
Okay.
And the S in the surface camera.
Good idea.
Even though we're going to use them the other way.
Do you want to try it out in there?
I guess we could open the window here, just as well.
The window's all - frosted over.
Is it?
Well, I hate to stick my finger on it. I'm not sure which side it's on.
We'll have to - have to turn the heaters on tomorrow.
No, I think when the Sun gets on them, it'll - them. Yes, the one on your side is.
The black and white is magazine 2.
I don't guess there's any need to tape that up now.
We're on the back side now, right?
Yes, just come into - we're just coming into sunlight.
And we don't get the - contrast.
What's the mission time, Mike?
Just a second. About 82 hours even.
82:02
Okay, when do you get your tracking?
In a little while.
About what time?
About another half hour.
Before 83 hours?
Wasn't like this yesterday - must be because the Sun was on it.
Boy, look at that big mother coming up there. Looks like we're heading for - over the horizon.
I don't think there's any place except in the - in here, that it says anything about 16-millimeter footage...
In the card, right?
No, I'm thinking about for the descent. Here we are, 16 millimeter, H-CEX, f:4, 500, infinity, 6 frames per second. Okay.
You got the Flight Plan handy, Mike?
Yes, I have. Just a second.
I don't want it up here. I just want you to - when you get a chance, to read off the items that are on there, make sure we got them.
It says perform housekeeping chores, stow helmets, stowage bags; unstow mirror, checklist, and disposal assembly. Stow interim stowage assembly, unstow and configure for use 16 millimeter, HC-EX, f:4, 500, infinity, 6 frames per second. That's all it says - on that page. That's where we are now. The next thing is an hour from now when we transfer to LM power and activate the Comm.
12 feet per second - half an hour.
Did you say something about taking pictures right now?
No, no, stop the camera.
Yes, I know, I don't think it'd take a very good picture right now.
One thing, when you get way up here, you can - see a lot more of that secondary strut.
No, that thing - that's holding up those damn baffles.
Well, if we could get a towel, we could get us a couple of fair-to-middling pictures out of here.
Alright. You want one?
Yes. Maybe - Some of it will come off, anyway.
Hand me a towel when you get a chance.
left window.
This one's getting pretty well cleared off over here on the left.
You want the COAS in the forward window for undocking, huh? And you don't want the filter attached? I stuck it up here.
All that'll do is warm it up.
When do we have AOS?
Well, we - we should have AOS in - oh - 16 - 18 - in about another 20 minutes.
Alright, then, I think - the way we're sitting, why, we're going to be able to get a picture - of the Earth coming right up there. What do you think about that?
Unique feature - photography. on the top of it.
What have you been using, 5.6 at 1/250th?
Yes..
What do you know, it works!
I could sure get the stop watch, huh?
Yes, you have the exact time to AOS - because I don't have my watch - set up for that.
I'm just fooling around. What do you need - AOS time? AOS is going to be - well, let's see - 82:30 - about 15 minutes from now.
Okay. I'll get another good picture of what comes along. Well, hell, I guess we might as well load the other camera and make sure it works, too, huh?
Adjust the - chronometer and put the cables in it, huh?
Yes.
Well, look, if we load this one - if I put the film on this one, and take a picture or two, well, I'll have to take it back off again; that's the only trouble. I won't have to, but it doesn't stow as neatly. If you don't mind doing - powered descent with the camera in there, I think that's probably alright. Well, wait a minute, I bet I could put this one loaded where the other one goes...
Where have you hid the shaving cream, Mike?
No wonder -.
Uh,.
that's the reason...
No, I don't think you know. I don't think you know. I don't see how you know.
Hey, Neil, you see any need for keeping this thing?
What's that?
In the LM, this cover for the camera. Think about that for a while - I got it loaded, and I don't see any need to ever change it. If it works now - I guess if it quits before we actually went EVA, why there might be some reason to. 5.6 at 250th, huh?
Now, a few pictures of that and one of Earthrise and - and then we'll stow it.
Well, I can't do anything until we transfer to LM power.
Do you know where the shaving cream is?
Shaving cream?
Yes.
Yes, I sure do; it's...
In the penlight.
in the penlight compartment, huh?
How about this thing; you see any need to - to keep that in the LM?
Neil, what did you do with the - camera back sight?
I haven't had it.
Okay. What do you think about that?
I can't think of any reason why we might use it.
Well, there's a COAS - dust cover that I think fits in the same category, don't you? The thing that you got to move out to put the COAS in?
He's shaving.
I'm through with the Flight Plan, Neil, if you want it.
razor?
The razor should be in there with the shaving cream, isn't it?
No...
It wasn't?
shaving cream.
The razor wasn't in there?
The razor's in here, and I think the shaving cream was when I pulled it out, but...
How much time to AOS, Mike?
82:30 - about 5 minutes.
Don't know what I'm doing with VHF B on.
Hey, Mike?
Yes.
You got VHF B available?
What? Say again?
I don't know. According to this lousy thing, I'm powering up VHF B - T/R.
Not right now, not for another half hour or so.
No, I know, but - Are you going to have your VHF on?
If I'm going to record your data, I am.
Well, it doesn't say doodly squat about recording data.
coming up now.
Did you get them?
No, sure didn't.
Yes.
But I can't see - I see the Earth, but it's a lousy picture.
Could you wait just one? I'm right in the middle of the event-timer setting.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're standing by. Out.
Okay, Houston. We'll be doing P22 in just a couple of minutes here.
You want to come in, Neil? Going in?
Roger. We copy all that. You're looking good.
Want back up?
No.
Here's your shaving cream.
My only problem is I'm going to come over here and grab a switch and arm this hand controller.
Alright. I'll be out of your way.
Okey dokey. I'll tell you what you could do, if you're not doing anything else, is - supposed to take five marks, 30 seconds apart. When I take the first one, you can take a hack and see...
Okay.
whether I'm spaced properly or not, you know what I mean?
Yes.
Coach me along on when to take mark number 2, mark number 3, 4, 5.
And could you give me a hack on the MDC mission timer? It's going up to 35 minutes. Ready...
Mark it.
35 minutes.
Okay, that's good. That program alarm is normal. It will reach that when the trunnion gets down below 50 degrees.
Okay.
All I'm doing is waiting for - the time. Everything else is done.
You holding inertial, Mike?
Yes.
No wonder the Earth isn't moving.
Ho-hum, ho-hum. I only got set up for this thing about an hour early. Better late than never; better early than late.
should be coming over the horizon here pretty soon.
What should be?
Old A-1. Old A-1.
Now, we'll see if you can find something that looks like A-1.
I got the Earth down by the strut.
The problem with this window is, Neil, I think it's too cold in here.
Neil, I'm going to get up here and get pitch - Manual Attitude Pitch to Accel Command. Those hand controllers are armed, so beware.
Okay.
If I'd known you were going to be here, I'd have incorporated you into the procedures.
Keep looking through the periscope, then.
What I need is - 0.3 to 0.5 on this thing, closer to 3. I'd get it, but you...
I'll watch.
just as a double-check...
I'll watch.
The pre-flight -.
That is working.
Okay, fine.
Okay, Mark it...
Number 1. They're 30-second marks.
Check.
15.
How many?
15 - 20 - 25 - 30 -
Mark it...
Number 3.
Okay.
I have a feeling somehow I got to do these.
15...
Okay.
25...
Mark it...
Number 3.
Okay.
15 - 20 - 25...
Mark it...
Number 4.
Okay.
15 - 20 - 25...
Mark it...
Number 5.
Okay.
Check.
Checklist says - You're going to go blind doing this - 06 71 - confirm 7000; 06 89 confirm 320 7000...
Just leave it. Keep pitching?
Yes. But I don't know why we're getting that thrust rate there, maybe the getting unhappy...
look at that roll and stuff that yaw.
Yes. It's just like the simulator, remember that?
Yes.
It's.
We're yawing pretty good. 0.4, I'd say...
We're going to have to check that out.
towards gimbal lock.
Toward gimbal lock?
It's only gone 10 degrees towards gimbal lock.
Well, that's a pretty good error. I don't know why in the hell it does that.
Would you like to control the? I'd say we're going to keep pitching for quite a while.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead.
Roger. You copy that Noun 49 on your downlink? If you've had enough time, I'll proceed.
We got it. Go ahead, Mike.
Look, what gimbal angle was that when - on the pitch - when that activity started, just out of curiosity?
Oh, must have been around - 210.
Just like the simulator.
Okay, now, the Flight Plan says where we want to stop, that says so right here - pitch 229 is where we want to stop.
Okay, we've gone by that, however, quite a ways.
I'm sorry, let's stop, then.
Is that local vertical?
No.
Okay. And after those pictures, lunar surface.
You want to go back to 229 or what?
Let me see the Flight Plan just a second. Yes.
Might as well just - just let it stop itself, Neil.
I've got to - look at the...
Yes, go ahead.
the. like - gangbusters?
225 is.
Mark...
2009.
Mark...
22590. Minus 00177.
Okay. So much for that.
Apollo 11, Houston. We see a Noun 89. You can do the Verb 34 now. Over. Beat me to it.
A beautiful view out here, Neil.
Yeah. I've done it, Charlie.
Rog.
What's the GET?
It's 82:51.
There's Mount Marilyn.
Yes.
Okay, we didn't waste any gas by doing what we did, but what we wasted gas by was that goddamn DAP activity. I don't understand that. Just like the simulator.
Sure enough.
You got a good view there, Neil?
Yes, I sure do.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
All that procedure for P22 seemed to work very well. The only thing that was a little odd, is that there was some DAP thruster activity. I had pitch in Accel Command, and roll and yaw in Rate Command, and somehow, roll and yaw got excited and the DAP went into a flurry of thruster firing. We've noticed the same thing in the CMS, and just written it off as a CMS peculiarity.
Roger. We saw that activity, Mike. We'll see if we can track it down and let you know. Over.
Okay.
Well, one P22 out of the way. Ho, ho, ho!
What were the results?
Well...
Or could you tell?
they're sort of inconclusive because I marked - see, they gave me...
Apollo 11, Houston. You can proceed to the sleep attitude now. Over.
That's in work, Houston.
Hey, how about holding this for just a little bit?
Yes, let's hold this attitude a little bit. I want to look at the...
Okay.
Boy, that's beautiful out there, isn't it?
TPI approach. Man, this is really something, you ought to look at this. You want to watch our approach into the landing site. You got to watch right through this window. We're coming over - we just passed Mount Marilyn. We're coming up on Maskelyne series here - straight out ahead, coming into the landing area.
Houston, we're holding inertial a little while to study the approach to the landing zone.
Roger.
See the monocular...
I don't either,.
Is there one?
Well, a crater...
There go Sidewinder and Diamondback. God, if you ever saw checkpoints in your life, those are it.
But we don't get to see them.
You don't?
No, we roll over right here at this little - well, you see Boot Hill coming up right here?
Yes, yes, yes.
And just beyond it that's - that crater right on track there, the big one?
That's Mount Marilyn? Past Boot Hill?
No, Duke Hill.
Duke Hill?
No, I'm sorry that's...
Duke Island, Duke Island.
Oh God, look at that Moltke, he's my favorite. Look at that son of a bitch. You see all those roads - triangular roads leading right past him?
Yes.
That's US-1, I guess, huh?
Yes.
There's crater 130 over there, although I can't quite see - see 129, but I can't quite see 130.
Can you see, Neil?
I'm not sure.
I think I can see it, for sure. Yes, I got it beautiful - I can - I got the whole landing site here.
That far?
The one that's shorter there?
Houston, this is Apollo 11, in the Eagle. Apollo 11 in the Eagle. And I got a beautiful view of the whole landing area.
Apollo 11, Houston. You are breaking up badly. Say again. Over.
Roger. I can see the entire landing area from the position I'm in, looking out the left window in the LM.
Roger, Buzz. Understand you can see the entire landing area looking out the LM windows. Over.
That's right.
Boy, that sure is eerie looking.
Isn't that something?
enough of a shot down there, but you can't find a single spot on the surface that doesn't look 1-degree sun angle, that's - that's just a lousy sun angle.
That's spectacular out there - Looks like you're flying right into the side of a mountain, doesn't it?
Yes, sure does.
I missed taking a picture of it,.
Well, that was good. Shall we go to maneuver, I mean to sleep attitude - anybody object to doing that?
That'd be alright.
Okay, I'm ready for you cats to transfer to LM power. What time GET you got?
Apollo 11, Houston. Say again. Over.
80...
Get the, Buzz.
83 hours. You ready to do it?
You ready to do it?
Stand by. Yes, go ahead and do it.
Okay.
You got 83 hours right now, huh?
Yes, 83 hours, and we're on LM power.
Apollo 11, Houston. We got a lot of noise on the downlink. Would you please try your High Gain in wide beamwidth. The angles are 180 on the yaw, and pitch zero. Over.
Glycol pump.
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read on the High Gain? Over.
Roger, Mike. You're a lot better now. Over.
Okay. You want it wide beam for some reason?
Will you cut my Suit Power and Audio, Off, please?
That's affirmative. We got you in the shadow zone. You're looking right down along the engine bell towards the Earth so we need you in wide beam. Over.
Yes.
Okay, going Off now.
Okay. Fine. We're starting our maneuver to sleep attitude. Roll 82, pitch 229, yaw zero.
Roger. The angles you got in the Flight Plan will be good when you get there.
About ready to maneuver?
Go ahead.
Okay.
Yes?
You're past step 4?
Houston, 11.
What's the page?
Go ahead, 11. Over.
Okay. We're on page Activation 12 and 13, at step 4, and verify descent talkbacks gray, and they're barber-pole.
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to put - take the low voltage taps Off, Reset, then On. Over.
Stand by. We've got it. We've just had - one circuit breaker out of position.
Okay.
We have them gray now.
Rog.
Watch that.
Don't we want it dark?
I thought the lights were going out. Man, that voltage is really falling off.
Hey, Mike.
Yes.
VHF circuit breaker.
I can't hear you, Buzz.
He says: Why don't you turn on VHF B, just for kicks.
Alright, I'll do it. You going to send me some data?
Yes, I'll get right to it.
Huh?
I'll get right to it.
Alright.
Soon as I get some comm first.
Yes, because when I - because when I record your data, I'm on Simplex A.
Yes, well, that's when you're talking at the same time.
Yes, okay. You want me just to turn up B now?
There's signal strength.
Hello, Houston. Hello, Houston. This is Apollo 11, Eagle. Over.
A lot of static - on the Command Module S-band.
Well, we - we should still have him.
Houston, Apollo 11. Radio check on S-band.
I'm not getting them on...
Well, we're almost at sleep attitude. Just stand by one, and, as soon as we get there, I'll find out where they are. I'm going to dick with the DAP right now.
should have warmed up by now.
I've got nothing but static.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Oh, he's transmitting on B.
Hey, Mike, you transmitting on B?
Mike, what are you transmitting on up there?
Say again.
What are you transmitting on up there?
I'm transmitting right now on Omni A, but I'm about to get new High Gain angles. Just 1 second. Okay, we're there.
How come I - he don't hear you on Intercom?
You should hear...
Houston, Apollo 11 - Apollo 11, Eagle. Over.
Roger, Eagle. This is Houston. We read you. Over.
Roger. I read you about four-by-four. Could you give me a short count, please?
Geezes, I don't hear him.
Roger, Eagle. Coming in with the short count - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Houston out. Over.
We don't read them, Buzz.
He's - he's on LM S-band, Neil, apparently.
Oh.
Yes.
Roger. Are you copying my Low Bit Rate? Over.
Rog. We got some beautiful data here, Eagle. We're - All those guys are looking at it - systems guys. We'll have some word for you in a minute how everything looks.
Roger. I'm all ready to switch to High Bit Rate, if that's okay with you.
Would you please stand by, Eagle. We want to get to the proper sleep attitude before we proceed on with the comm check. Over.
Standing by.
Houston, Eagle. We'll go ahead with the camera check-out. I'm still on low taps, and I assume there's no problem doing that. Over.
Stand by.
That's affirmative. No problem on that, Eagle. You can go ahead and power up the sequence camera. Over.
Houston, Columbia. How do you read on the High Gain?
Should have done that before.
Eagle, be advised - sounds like a hot mike. Over.
Right. Yes.
Did you hear him answer?
No.
I didn't either. Buzz is reading him, though.
Roger. If you're reading me now, I am in hot mike because I'm in ICS push-to-talk, and Downvoice Backup. Over.
Roger. We just wanted to remind you. Over.
Thank you.
Columbia, this is Houston. Are you maneuvering to sleep attitude? Over.
Eagle, this is Houston. We have lost all our voice and data with Columbia. Would you see if he is maneuvering to sleep attitude? Over.
Houston, Columbia. How do you read on the High Gain? Over.
Hey, Mike. You maneuvering to sleep attitude?
Hey, how about asking them if they can hear me calling?
I don't believe they can hear you, Mike. Are you maneuvering now to sleep attitude?
Well, we're in sleep attitude, and I got the High Gain angles, and they should be good angles. And I'm locked on and I got about a half signal strength, and they can't hear me.
Houston, Eagle. The Columbia has maneuvered to sleep attitude. He's got the High Gain Antenna's - antenna angles set in, and he should be communicating with you. Over.
Roger. We don't have him. Stand by.
Eagle, Houston. Would you please have Columbia hit Command Reset? Over.
No go.
What'd he say?
Wilco. Command Reset.
Okay.
Eagle, Houston. Since we're in sleep attitude, I'll give you another long count. If you're reading in this mode, we'd like you to switch to high bit rate. Over.
try him again.
Roger. Go ahead with your short count.
Houston, Columbia. Reading you loud and clear.
Roger. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. We're reading you five-by. You can go to high bit rate now. Over.
Roger. Going to high bit rate now.
Eagle, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Houston, this is Eagle. Roger. Read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
Roger. Reading you five-by also, Buzz, and we got the high bit rate. It's looking beautiful through Goldstone. Giving you a count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Please give us a count. Over.
Roger, Houston. Eagle with a count. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Over.
Roger. Stand by. We're reading you five-by. Over.
Okay. I'm ready to go S-band voice. Over.
Stand by, Eagle. Stand by on step 4.
Columbia, this is Houston. Would you please give us P00 and Accept. We've got a load for you. Break. Eagle, we are ready to go to step 4. Please select S-band Voice to Voice. Over.
Hello, Eagle. This is Houston. How do you read - normal voice? Over.
Eagle - Houston, this is Eagle. Read you loud and clear on S-band, normal voice. How me? Over.
Rog. You're beautiful in this mode, Buzz. We're reading you five-by. Coming with a short count and we'd like one back from you. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Houston out.
Roger. Houston, Eagle. You're gorgeous also. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Eagle, over.
Roger, Eagle. This is better than the downvoice backup. Stand by one.
Eagle, Houston. Everybody's happy as a clam with this mode. We'd like to stay here for a little bit. Telemetry looks great, and the voice is great. Over.
Roger. Understand. I'm checking out camera number 4 now.
Eagle, Houston. Say again what you're checking out? Over.
Roger, Houston. Eagle has checked out both 70-millimeter cameras and both 16-millimeter cameras, and all work fine. Over.
Sounds great. Stand by.
Eagle, Houston. We've looked over your systems on the high bit rate. Everything looks super; we're ready to go. Over.
Roger. Stand by. You want to go back to low bit rate now?
Stand by on that. Over.
Eagle, Houston. We look good through the 210 on this mode. We're going to shift data select to an 85-foot dish to see what we got, and then we'll be back to you on the 210. If you'll stand by a couple of minutes in this mode, we'll be back with you. Over.
Roger. Eagle standing by.
Eagle, Houston. How do you read? Over.
Houston, Eagle. Read you loud and clear. Over.
Roger. We're reading you five-by. We've got the voice good through the 85. The telemetry is in and out through the 85. Stand by. We'll be back through you - with you through the 210. Over.
Eagle, Houston. You can go step 5 now. We'd like low bit rate. Over.
Houston, Eagle. You have low bit rate.
Roger. Copy, Eagle.
Eagle, Houston. Could you give me a short count - this mode? Over.
Houston, this is Eagle with a short count. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Eagle. Over.
Roger, Eagle. You're five-by. This S-band voice is really beautiful. Over.
And, Eagle, Houston. We'll be standing in - standing by in this mode for a minute or so. We'll be back with you if you'll just stand by. Over.
Roger.
Eagle, this is Houston coming through the 210. How do you read? Over.
Roger. Read you loud and clear.
Eagle, this is Houston. We're happy with all our data in all modes. You can power down the comm now. Over.
Roger. Understand. Eagle will power down the comm, and we're just approaching 27 volts now. Looks like we won't have to bother with the high taps.
Rog.
We're powering down. Out.
Roger. Copy. Out.
Columbia, this is Houston. We got a TEI-11 PAD for you and an update on the water dump. Over.
Stand by one, Houston. Are you through with the DSKY?
That's affirm. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Columbia. Ready to copy TEI-11. Over.
Rog, Columbia. Here we come with the TEI-11. SPS/G&N: 37200; minus 0.60, plus 0.47. Noun 33, 098:05:24.22; plus 4144.8, plus 0371.9, minus 0242.2. Roll is NA; pitch, 020; the rest of the PAD is NA. Set stars are NA. The ullage is two quads - correction, two jets for 16 seconds; use Bravo and Delta. In the comments, the undocked present CSM - correction, this is for - TEI-11 is undocked. Present onboard weight of the CSM is 37,200 pounds, about 50 Alpha on your DAP. Over.
All right. I read back TEI-11. SPS G&N: 37200; minus 0.60, plus 0.47. Plus 098:05:24.22, plus 4144.8, plus 0371.9, minus 0242.2. NA, 020; the rest of the PAD NA. Ullage, two jets for 16 seconds, Quads B and D. Undocked. Present CSM weight is okay in the DAP.
Roger, 11. And we'd like you to do a waste-water dump at 84 hours down to 25 percent. Over.
Roger. Understand. Waste-water dump to 25 percent at 84 hours.
Roger. And, Mike, we'll have LOS in about 11 minutes at 83:44. AOS is 84:30, and prior to - or at LOS, we would like you to go - Configure the S-band for High Gain track to Reacq, High Gain Beam to Narrow, and let's try that to see if we can get an automatic Reacq at the next AOS. Over.
Good idea.
I'm in Reacq and Narrow now.
Rog.
Apollo 11, Houston. Also, that water that you got on the aft bulkhead, we - If it's not too much, we just recommend sopping it up and then throwing the sponges away in the waste wat - in the waste stowage area. If it's too much, then we use - recommend using the procedure in the checklist on page F 10-14. Over.
Alright. Thank you.
Apollo 11, Houston. Would you have Buzz make sure he gives us the OPS pressure readings before you close up? Over.
Will do.
Houston, 11. The OPS's read 5,750, both bottles.
Roger.
Armstrong says it's the hatch and - if we leave the probe and drogue there, we'll save us some time tomorrow. I don't know if it's tolerable sleeping or not. I think what previous crews have been doing is re-installing all that claptrap up in there.
Yes.
But...
What?
Yes, forward's okay.
I don't think that would be too horrible sleeping down there.
It's for sure it's not going anywhere; this one's bolted down two places - and this one is...
You can try it. If we could find a place to put our legs back in there, it'll be alright.
See - it's going to be hard to get into that - sampler there.
No - no, that's alright. That's the place for it.
Okay, lights went out - except for all those radioactive ones in there.
Well, comm's good. Son of a bitch might work.
Sure it'll work. Anything in a pretty cockpit like that is bound to work.
Well, I propose leaving the probe and drogue in here overnight. Save all - doing all that claptrap in the morning.
It's okay with me.
Fine.
You through in the LM?
How's that going to affect...
Sleeping!
sleeping?
I'll be glad to sleep over there, alright? I don't think it'll affect that. I'd rather sleep, I'd rather sleep with the probe and drogue than have to dick with it in the morning.
Alright, that's fine, I can have it there. I don't know how I'd get out, but -.
That's, alright.
Hey, you don't want to bring this one back? You on a weight-saving kick for the Command Module?
You want it?
Sure, you...
There's room for the Hasselblad.
you got stowage space?
You can have it if you want it.
You got a place to fix things that rattle around?
Sure. Like hatches? if you'll take time to get out of the hallway.
Let's get some music.
Get out of my damn hallway, Aldrin, so I can put my hatch in and then we can all...
How about these tapes?
Okay.
Okay, 95:50 IVT to the LM. What time is it now?
83:53:00.
I figure that as being 12 hours. About time for a Lomotil, huh? Well, not quite.
How about the systems stuff - to put the machine to bed.
You go to Reacq and Narrow?
Yes.
So I guess the comm's pretty well taken care of?
Yes.
Have you got the waste water dump?
No, I haven't done that, but I will.
Let's see, I imagine we want to go out of Voice? Or not?
Very, very...
The whole bit, they said.
Okay.
Lunar orbit asleep. (Cough.) S-Band Squelch, Enable?
I did it.
Got that, huh?
Yes.
High Gain, Reacq, Narrow. Antenna pitch angle...
Yes, I did that.
that's all it says.
Okay.
Plus the normal configuration.
Doesn't it say anything about Down Voice Backup - or any of that stuff?
(Cough)
No.
Okay.
Waste water dump, we'll wait until 84 hours. They may have the vent modeled or some crazy thing like that, so I want to be at the right time.
Alright.
Well, let's see, normal lunar configuration. Well, it is Down Voice Backup.
Yes.
Well, let's get going here. Primary, Primary, High, Voice, (cough) PCM, Range, Down Voice Backup, Aux Tape, Off. Telemetry to Data; and Uptlm Command to Normal; VHF A and B, Off; Receive only,; PCM/Analog, Record, Forward, Normal, Normal - that's okay. Low - Primary, Reacq, and Narrow. Well, Comm's set.
Good.
I got to vacuum up some water and dump the waste water tank, and we're about set.
Hey, I got a fuel cell - O2...
Hey, our water's about all gone.
Did they say anything about the O2 purge?
Must have gone into the LM.
Yes, I think it did. It went on the windows. They didn't say anything about it, huh?
No.
Well, I guess we'll do it then. Anybody get my - Well, heck, I guess we're really not through with them yet, are we?
I updated the LOS time in your...
Yes. I think I'll wait until we get them back again before doing the purge. Okay? Because, I don't know, maybe they want all that stuff done on the back side.
Well, I propose to give myself a little bit of a - a bath, but not to put that damn LCG on tonight. You never did ask them about the - about the, huh? I sure haven't found them.
I think we ought to do that.
Neil, you still got that tissue dispenser, the empty one?
Thank you.
What's baseline altitude? the altitude - descent altitude settings?
That's the - that's the last meal we eat before descent, huh?
Sure is.
Wowee!
95 - that's - 7 - got 10 hours. Whew!
Might whip out that piece of bread in there.
Through in the tunnel, Mike?
Through, yes.
Okay, I want to get the lights out then.
Okay,.
What are your dosimeters reading?
up a little bit.
Mine says - 11012.
I can't read this little fart. Says 10013.
I think they all started out at even thousands. They had them each different so they could tell which was which.
Well, I don't know about you, but I think I'll raid the pantry for some bite-size stuff.
I don't know when we'll get a chance to use it - maybe some time...
Monoculars?
during the maneuvers
Found it, huh?
We're going to take that into the LM.
Yes. Sure can.
novel and earn a million dollars.
Amazing how quickly you adapt. Why, it doesn't seem weird at all to me to look out there and see the Moon going by, you know?
Oh, that is weird - that crazy Moon out there again, huh? Funny-looking thing.
Buzz, this crazy bracket goes right here. It's probably right the hell in your way, isn't it?
No, no.
Not in your way?
No, I can survive with that.
Alright, let me put it up there. It'll be one less thing to do in the morning. It's in backwards, but I don't think...
Well, if I don't need this thing any more, I think I'll stow that one away. Systems are yours tomorrow?
Yes.
I don't know as we've got much to do. There's a purge.
Is it 84 hours yet? Yes, it is. I'm going to dump the waste water.
You dumping?
Yes.
(Cough) Boy, it's a dusty vehicle in here. Man! But that view approaching the landing site is just fantastic right out - right smack out the window, you know that?
Yes.
Except there's such a big shadow being cast by everything...
1 or 2 degrees, Neil?
that I really couldn't...
I think...
I could identify the Cat's Paw and I could identify the pair of craters right at the end, but I couldn't really make out the backward V nor the three little curved ones on one side...
I didn't see the backwards either.
but I could see the area where it all was, you know, and...
Yes, yes.
it didn't go any farther back that this, and it didn't really go any farther forward than that - it really didn't. You know, it was rougher than a cob.
Rougher than a cob, but I didn't see.
Well, when you compare it with the surrounding areas, why it's - it's pretty reasonable.
You want this somewhere?
If you don't mind, I'll put it on this big piece of Velcro over here by the fuel cell.
Yes, that's a good place for it.
Anybody for a barf bag?
Can you think of any use for a slide rule in the LM, Neil?
Huh?
I can't think of any use for two of them.
Okay.
That comm was so good I don't think I'd need those damn things.
Anybody say anything about terminating battery current?
No.
You remember anything about that, Neil?
No.
Somebody's blue towels? Did I dislodge those by mistake or did you have those?
No, don't believe I had them.
I had them out, kind of floating around back here.
Everything I think you could dislodge, they forgot to put Velcro on the damn thing.
Could you - maybe reach back and - hand me that wrench right quick?
Yes, I sure could. Sure could.
You want me to swap one?
No, I think I'll keep one for tonight.
Okay.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You like this?
Not much.
Want one?
Yes.
He's getting a of that, huh?
Well, I just want to make sure I'm through with the roll. I think I am.
Can't figure out how you tell when one's gone. I think that was it.
Oh, it stopped!
It's a bear to get in and out of here.
Think maybe it'd be easier if you them right here.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11.
11, Houston. Roger. Reading you fine, and it looks like the automatic Reacq went very well just as soon as you came around the limb. We have several small items to discuss with you here just before you go to sleep. Over.
Go ahead, Owen.
Okay, 11. First of all, on our LM systems checks, everything went fine. I would like to remind you, though, tomorrow you may see an ascent pressure light when you activate the MC&W. There should be no problem, however. You did note that the APS Aux tank pressure was only reading 111 psi, which is normal at this point, but below the level which will trigger your light due to the helium which has been dissolved into the propellant. Over.
Roger. Understand that. Thank you.
Roger. And next item, the supercritical helium rise rate is nominal, and you also had that question for us about your thruster activity during the P22 on the last rev. Believe we understand that now, as you reported that your pitch was in Accel Command and your yaw and roll were in Rate Command. You were firing your pitch thrusters. This will couple rates into your yaw and roll axes, and the - You were at that time holding only half a degree deadband and coupling rates into yaw and roll produced the extra firings about the yaw and roll axes. Over.
Yeah, that may be true. It's very peculiar coupling, in that it waits longer than you would think and its reaction is greater than you would think. We were getting yaw rates of around four-tenths of a degree per second, for example.
Roger, Mike. We did play the data back, and that's the way it looked upon analysis of the chart recordings back here. Over.
Okay. Fine.
They've also looked at the result of your landmark tracking. The marks all apparently were very good, and we've got a full page of data here relative to the altitudes of the various site locations, which I won't read up to you, but I did want to let you know that the marks apparently went very well. I also have your consumable budgets, particularly your RCS propellant quantities. They're Deltas from nominal if you should want them. Your worst quad is quad Charlie, which is 9 percent low. I'll not read up the others unless you want them. Over.
Okay. How about the O2 fuel cell purge? You want that now?
I'll have to stand by just a moment.
Okay. And then the other one is, we're still charging Battery A.
11, Houston. We would like to delay the fuel cell purge until the backside of the Moon, and you go ahead and - should terminate your battery charge at this time. Over.
Okay. Understand. I knew we had another O2 and H2 purge coming up in the morning. I wasn't sure whether you wanted to go through with this one or not. I'll wait until the backside and then do it.
That's fine, Buzz.
Terminate battery charging now.
That's right, and one other systems item here - in order to balance your cryo tanks, would you get your O2 Tank 1 and your H2 Tank 2 heaters off? Over.
Okay. I have O2 Tank Heater 1 off, and H2 Tank Heater 2 off.
That's right, Mike, and we believe you have your quad Bravo and quad Charlie turned off in your DAP at this time, and a 5-degree deadband. We'd prefer a 10-degree deadband for your sleep period overnight, here. Over.
Okay.
One other item relative to a malfunction procedure. It's unlikely that you'll have to worry about this tomorrow, but in your malfunction list under docking on page F11-9, there is a malfunction procedure for a high O2 flow rate at the top of - under tunnel, at the top of page 11-9. We would like to have you not use that malfunction procedure should you encounter the high O2 flow rate, and instead, check back with Houston for a revised procedure should you find that situation. Over.
Understand, and note has been made in my checklist.
11, Houston. Roger. That just about takes care of all the items we have here on the ground before time to hit the sack, and I guess you will have a pre-sleep check for us before you go to bed.
Rog. We're in the midst of cycling the O2 and H2 fans now.
Roger.
And the radiation is as follows: CDR, 11012; CMP, 10013; LMP, 09015. Negative medication. Over.
Roger. Copy, 11.
Houston, Apollo 11.
11, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. We're thinking about taking the monocular with us on into the LM. We think it might prove to be of some use. Over.
Roger, Buzz. It sounds like a good idea for some of your surveying work there inside the cockpit. Over.
Okay. You want to run that by with whoever might be concerned?
I sure will.
Apollo 11, Houston. We've apparently lost the High Gain lock. We would appreciate it if you would give us a help manually to try to re-lock up on the High Gain. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. You're.
11, Houston. Reading you very weak, still too far down in the noise to complete the full transmission. If you'd give us a hand on a manual relock, we'd appreciate it.
Apollo 11, Houston. We're still unable to pick you up on the High Gain Antenna. Request you go to Manual, and Wide Beamwidth. The pitch and yaw angles in your checklist are good ones. You should be able to find us there. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read now?
11, Houston. Loud and clear this time. How me?
Loud and clear. You faded out on your last transmission. Over.
Roger. Are you in wide beam now?
Negative. I got you locked back on again, Reacq and Narrow.
Rog. That's all we want. We want to stay in Narrow, and we're a little puzzled about why we lost you here a few minutes ago. Do you have any ideas?
No, we sure don't - sure don't. We're showing - we're showing about 15 degrees plus pitch and about 270. That ought to be good and clear.
We concur there. We still don't have any good ideas on why we were lost.
11, Houston. Would you confirm that we did acquire automatically when you came around the limb for this passage. Over.
That's confirmed.
Thank you.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11.
11, Houston. On your Auto RCS Select switches, we show quad Bravo disabled but quad Charlie only partially disabled. Charlie 3, I believe, is the only one you have selected Off. Is that correct?
Ah, Roger. That's correct.
Roger.
How do they look to you now, Houston?
11, Houston. We see them all disabled at this time. Thank you.
Thank you.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
11, Houston. We're going to try to check out this ability to automatically reacquire on the S-band, and what we want to do is to secure our uplink carrier for about 30 seconds. Then we will turn it back on and see if the spacecraft equipment will automatically reacquire. So if you do not get a call from us within about 3 minutes, that means we have not been able to reacquire and request your assistance on a manual acquisition. Over.
Okay. We understand.
11, Houston. We also would appreciate, if you will note the angles that the antenna tracks through in its attempt to reacquire. Over.
Roger. We'll do that.
I have a bit of fruitcake left over from somewhere. If anybody wants some, here it is..
Let's have a little chewing gum. Anybody like some chewing gum?
40 - and 250.
43.
11, Houston. It looks like we're locked back up again with no delay. How does it look on board? Over.
Roger. The signal strength dropped very rapidly to zero; and the pitch and yaw, in about 3 seconds, moved toward 40 degrees pitch and 240 degrees yaw. Right now, they're sitting on about 15 degrees pitch and, oh, about 265 degrees yaw. So they didn't move very far, about 30 degrees apiece; and then they picked right back on up again. Over.
Roger. Some of The Luckiest People in the background there. We copied your pitch and yaw angles.
11, Houston. Could you give us the location of your - pitch and yaw location of your position indicators? Over.
Roger. They're in the same position as the antenna right now; plus 15 degrees pitch and - Now, no, wait a minute. I got them - got it at about 275 instead of 265.
Okay. Thank you.
11, Houston. We'd like to try the same procedure once more. We'll leave the carrier off a little longer and be back up for a call within 4 minutes. Over.
Okay.
1,000 pounds -.
That'll bring some more junk back here.
Couldn't have done better myself.
11, Houston. We're locked back up again. Can you give us a report on how the antenna behaved?
Roger. It was essentially identical as before. The pitch went to 45, 40 to 45 and the yaw went to about - to about 255, 245 to 255. And then it rather quickly locked up at 15 degrees pitch and 270 yaw. Over.
11, Houston. Roger. Your angles are 45 and 255. Do I understand that as soon as the carrier dropped, it went to these angles? Or did it only go to these angles after the uplink carrier was re-enabled and the antenna began to hunt - to re-acquire? Over.
No. As soon as the carrier dropped off, why, it drifted over to those angles and stayed there. Then when it came back up again, why, it hunted around for a while, but didn't get any further off. Gradually brought it on in to the angles where it is right now; and then the signal strength would take several jumps as evidently it goes from Wide to Medium to Narrow. Over.
11, Houston. Understand. And on another subject, request you zero your optics for the night. Over.
Roger. Zeroed.
Apollo 11, Houston. Can you confirm that you have changed the CO2 filter as per Flight Plan in the last hour? Over?
No. We're still eating. We're about to do it. We'll let you know.
Roger, 11. And we've got about 14 minutes to LOS. AOS is 86:30, an hour away. We're wondering whether or not you plan to have one man up at that time or would you all like to be asleep inside the next hour? Over.
Somebody will be up.
Roger. The thing that we're still puzzling on is the antenna, and if - as long as there will be somebody up - why, we would like to have somebody check the automatic Reacq on the next AOS.
Okay. We'll do that. We haven't chlorinated the water yet, and we haven't changed the lithium hydroxide. We're just still finishing up dinner.
Roger, Mike. Thank you.
It may be raunchy later.
It may be? There's no doubt about it!
Oh, I'll take a couple of small ones.
Apollo 11, Houston. We have LOS coming up in 2 minutes now, and AOS will be at 86 plus 28 plus 15. Over.
We'll see you on the other side, Houston.
Roger.
Anybody have one?
I'll have a little one.
Okay. Here you are.
Yes.
Okay.
I guess what I'm doing, I should do with the paper towels.
Everybody through with the water?
Yes, go ahead.
Ever find your box?
No. Gosh, you remember when they told us about - about putting buttons on the seat of these pants?
No, I don't remember.
Yes, they were working out - this elaborate scheme.
Yes, had a choice between and Velcro.
What's its use? I mean, don't keep me hanging in suspense.
Well, whatever I tell them, they didn't give me.
Shouldn't have anything.
Nothing in it.
Good grief, man!
They tell me you got to use Velcro on there. Maybe on the other side.
Use -
I got a - pair of Jockey shorts. Now cut - cut the lights off - lights off.
Very good, very good.
How'd you sleep last night, Buzz, up on top?
You open up the outer one, and you put the inner one in there and squeeze it and it breaks, then you got to take the and insert it and mush it all up - to get that stuff evenly distributed through it.
Why don't you guys sleep underneath tonight? I'll sleep top deck.
Oh, you're going to sleep downstairs tonight, aren't you?
Yes, that's right. I remember.
Unless you'd rather sleep up top, Buzz; I like - you guys ought to get a good night's sleep, going in that damn LM - How about - which would you prefer? Is that probe and drogue going to be in your way over there?
No, I don't think so.
Well, take your druthers, whichever you prefer.
Anybody goes right up here?
I've just been kind of looking around for it myself.
Buzz?
What?
I you.
Oh.
Yes, yes.
Yes, I.
Well, I thought today went pretty well. If tomorrow and the next day are like today, we'll be safe.
You got a crater coming up, Buzz? Right through here. I don't know if you can see it or not. If not, let me get a picture of it because it's really - got big on the bottom of it. It don't look good.
It's out this way.
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
Shoot here.
I'm not sure we should be shooting this - what we're shooting at or one point set. I guess you're alright - in this light stuff, I guess you're alright.
Okay, thank you.
Oops!.
What time is it, Neil, 88 hours, something like that?
86:13:00.
Doesn't it look like some of these crater walls had scallops inside like a design in a fan - like feathers.
Seashells.
Yes.
Like seashells - very pretty, very symmetrical.
Take along one of those craters.
I took overlapping pictures of all that.
Tomorrow, take - we're going to have to carry a lot of film to take as many pictures as they want.
I'll tell you what we ought to do,.
Oh, okay, let me go do that.
Anybody know when AOS is?
When is AOS?
Yes. When is AOS?
86:38?
I think it's.
Okay.
along in here.
Yes.
Where the hell is the horizon with the world coming over it? I guess it's behind us, huh?
Up there? We should be getting Earthshine - Earthrise features - should be coming up pretty soon.
Black and white.
There's a colored one right in there - I didn't think we put it there..
Alright.
There's this one - where's...?
The dark slide I think is right over there in the girth shelf.
Oh, yes, I got it.
That's - that's the one.
Are we going to keep the... lens on?
getting earlier in time. Yes, that's best - better.
Got a Master Alarm coming on here.
Your f:8 is 250 - at infinity?
Yes.
Good deal. Keep working, you got a lot of film.
Well, it's.
And I was.
Good deal.
Glad to hear it.
Through?
Yes -.
It's good.
Yes, I guess so. Nothing like filming your.
this field of view, it's mostly just blues. I keep getting mostly black and blue.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
11, Houston. Loud and clear here. Over.
Okay. We just appeared to get a solid lock for the last - oh, about a minute. The Tune-for-Max needles have been wandering up and down, and the pitch and yaw needles have been wandering around, but it appears to have reacquired by itself solidly now. We're just filling - finishing up our fuel cell purge. Hydrogen on number 3 is the last to go Off, and it'll be coming Off just in a second.
Roger, 11.
Huh? Is that right? Really should have looked.
flow?
Rate to High, Neil.
Apollo 11, Houston. We believe we've tracked down the reacquisition problem we had on the previous rev. It looks like it was a receiver power supply here on the ground and no problems in the spacecraft at all. Over.
Okay. Glad to hear it.
11, that really winds things up as far as we're concerned on the ground, for the evening. We're ready to go to bed and get a little sleep. Over.
Yeah. We're about to join you.
Rog.
