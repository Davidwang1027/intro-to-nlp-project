Apollo 11, this is Houston. For your information, we expect the maneuver to separation attitude to begin at 3 plus 05 plus 03, and to be completed at plus 09 plus 20. Separation at 3 plus 15 plus 00.
Roger. Time to begin maneuver is 3:05:03, complete 3:09:20. And separation 3 plus 15:00.
Roger. That separation should be 3 plus 15:03. My error in reading up.
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. All the booster functions are proceeding normally. The sequencing is in good shape, and it doesn't look like they're having any problems at all. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Our preliminary data indicates a good cut-off on the S-IVB. We'll have some more trajectory data for you in about half an hour. Over.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Hello, Houston. Hello, Houston. This is Apollo 11. I'm reading you loud and clear. Go ahead. Over.
Roger, 11. This is Houston. We had to shift stations. We weren't reading you through Goldstone. We show Pyro Bus A armed and Pyro Bus B not armed at the present time. Over.
That's affirmative, Houston. That's affirmative.
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. You're Go for separation. Our systems recommendation is arm both Pyro Buses. Over.
Okay. Pyro B coming armed. My intent is to use bottle Primary 1, as per the checklist; therefore, I just turned A on.
Roger. We concur with the logic.
two, Armed.
Two, Armed.
CMC Mode, Auto.
Auto.
Start the Digital Event Timer.
Okay, start.
And we're going to translate plus X and hold.
Mmmhmm.
CM/Launch Vehicle Sep pushbutton?
Mmmhmm.
Watch the tank pressure and the engine light.
Are you on tank pressures? You are.
And you're going to go to 100.8?
Mmmhmm.
You want to...
Here we go.
Okay, Houston, we're about to Sep.
Thrusting...
Sep!
This is Houston. We copy.
Look at that trash.
Sep complete.
Got Delta-V?
Okay, got 0.7; I'm going to stop there and...
go to Release; Delta-V indicator minus 100.8...
Roger.
Okay.
Service Module RCS propellant, verify eight of them grey.
Okay, you got problems there. Get the - there you go.
I'll get them.
Okay, okay.
What else? Did...
CM...
Primary and Secondary Propellant B went barber pole at Sep.
That was Secondary Propellant on quad - quad Bravo?
Quad Bravo, yeah; both the Primary and Secondary talkbacks went barber pole.
three, Open.
Okay, your...
Roger, we copy.
this is the one that 0.5, right? Is it - Mike, you key a Verb 62?
Yeah.
Proceed and you're pitching?
She's pitching.
Trying - to turn itself off again; look at this.
Is it holding it this time?
Watch, it'll probably go back to Rate Command.
That slows it down?
keep pitching.
Your Man(ual) Att(itude), Pitch, to Accel Command?
It went to Rate - Okay, I see an SLA panel going out.
Okay, you got to get a pitch rate in there...
See that SLA panel?
Is it flying - yet?
It's alright. She's darn well unbelievable - something.
I see it.
Do I need some circuit breaker in to get...
I see another - No, that's alright.
to get this camera going? Mike?
No, you need the power on over there, though.
I turned it on.
I got it. beautiful.
You sure you have the right power switch on?
Boy, that's...
Yeah.
You got him?
No, I don't.
Yes, Mike.
To the right over here.
Can you see him?
No, I don't see...
He's a little bit to our right.
Okay, I see him.
We need about a 5-degree right, and we need to stop our...
Okay. We'll stop here.
and we're pretty far away from him, too.
Okay, watch it, we should be stopping here.
How long do we want to run this film?
How does he look, Mike?
He's - he's fine.
Okay, you got 100.4 now.
Yeah, I know; those numbers don't mean anything. They were 99-something when we turned around; don't ask me why. I thrusted toward him quite a bit, and I don't know why those numbers were screwed up, but they were.
Buzz, how does he look to you; looks like he's getting closer to me.
get the BMAG?
Okay.
Yes, it looks like he's drifting down just a tad, and he's supposed to be.
How are our eight gray talk-backs; they still good?
They're good.
Flies like a spacecraft instead of a simulator. Hope that's good.
Sure beautiful. I hope you got some pictures, Buzz.
I got the 16 millimeter going...
Is it going?
16 frames at f:8...
Yeah.
70, 1/250th,.
Beautiful.
It really looks nice, doesn't it?
Hey, we're closing in a leisurely fashion.
Hey, how long does this?
It's on the - it's printed...
Yeah.
yeah, it's six frames at 15; I suggest toward the end you probably goose it up a little bit.
You want to get the whole thing?
I don't care tell by looking at.
The thing is, with this sitting there, I can't get much with the Hasselblad. That window's no good, I'm afraid.
Can I hold something for you?
Take a couple of.
Yeah, you might look - if you're looking for something to do, you might just look over my panel 1 and 8 and all that and make sure all the switches are - to your liking.
I'll do it.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Be sure that your RCS is working anyway.
How far out are you, Mike?
I'm still quite a ways. That's definitely an SLA panel - there's no doubt about that. Sure looks like panel. That stuff's hitting from the S-IVB from us. Geeze, look it - that one thing just hit the - gyro package on the S-band antenna.
Yes, things occasionally come scooting out.
And, occasionally, you know, a little piece of something hits the - what do you call that - covering? The whole LM quivers every so often. All - all the surface of it, Neil, you know, just kind of shakes like that.
Yeah?
Just in one spot; it's not being hit. I hope it doesn't come in...
Stand by; we're getting pretty close.
Just from the APS firing, you think?
Stand by; we're closing.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston broadcasting in the blind. Request Omni Bravo if you read us. Request Omni Bravo. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read?
Okay...
We don't have too much...
BMAG Mode, three - You should stabilize and align CM - BMAG Mode, three, to Att 1/Rate 2?
Okay.
And we're - translated plus X. That Capture Probe, Extend/Release, you've done that; CMC Mode, Free?
Yes, sir.
Yes.
Allow probe to damp spacecraft oscillations?
We did that.
Yes, you've done that. Docking Probe, Retract, Primary 1?
We did that.
Alright, after dock...
Docking Probe, Extend/Release, to Off?
Docking Probe, Extend/Release, to Off, I did that. Docking Probe, Retract,... to Off.
Okay, Docking Probe, Retract, two of them, Off?
No, no, wait a minute. It says Docking Probe, Extend/Release, to Off, huh?
Yes.
Okay.
Alright, let's go. Docking Probe, Retract, two of them, Off?
Yes, they're Off.
Alright. Circuit breakers: Docking Probe, two, Open.
Docking Probe, two, Open.
Okay, PCM Bit Rate is Low. Post-docking: it says Rate, High; Att Deadband, Max.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
Rate, High; Att Deadband, Max.
COAS Power, Off.
COAS Power, Off.
get this to stop.
Yes, that wasn't the smoothest docking I've ever done.
Well, it felt good from here.
I mean the - I mean the whole - I mean the gas consumption would be a lot more than I would have guessed, you know? I thought I could about equal the simulator in and I didn't - I bet you I used - I hate to quote a number, but I've been down around 30-some pounds in the simulator, and I'll bet this was 50, 60 pounds, something like that. Hate to quote a number.
How do the - Speaking of that, how do the Service Module RCS quantities look?
Well, Buzz is fooling around with that - Let me just...
They - they're all 90 except B, which is above 90.
Should be. Can't ever tell on 3...
No, C and D are B, anyway.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Okay...
Well, I got to go in there and dick...
I'm not sure that we're getting...
Well, Buzz is getting comm right now.
Yes, let Buzz do his High-Gain thing, and I'll get ready to go dick with the tunnel.
Sure is squiggly, isn't it? It really wanders all over, doesn't it?
Neil, where do you put this guy - usually?
I - clip it to that - clip up there beside the COAS - you see...
Okay.
see those clips up there, one of those. It's got a snap right here that's pretty good.
I think I can get it now -.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Okay, Buzz, how am I doing on the checklist?
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Well, I'm trying to...
You're at the High Gain...
you're at post-docking. I'm trying to get the High Gain going - and I'm having a little trouble - trouble.
That's Manual...
Whatever you do, take some pictures.
That should be on wide beam or?
Wide.
Okay.
Hey, if you're through there, give me that Verb 64.
What? Okay.
I'm amazed how it just wanders around for a given setting; you notice that?
There - it sounds like we got it now. There's your Verb 64.
We got signal strength.
Okay. You have to really be on Manual for those things to be indicating correctly.
He was but...-
Okay.
this one was just kind of wandering around there - with no - -
As soon as I went down to High Gain, was when the signal strength came up.
Okay, man.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger. We're copying you about five-by-two, very weak. Can you give us a status report, please?
Roger. We are docked. We do have acquisition with the High Gain at this time, I think.
Understand you are using the High Gain. Over.
That's affirmative.
Roger. I read - I read you very loud and clear, Buzz. Mike's pretty weak.
Roger. We've got the High Gain locked on, now, I believe; Auto tracking now.
Okay. You're coming in loud and clear, but Mike is just barely readable.
That was Neil. How are you reading Mike?
Loud and clear now, Mike, and we understand that you are docked.
That's affirmative.
Houston, CDR. How do you read?
11, CDR, loud and clear, Neil.
Okay.
11, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead.
Roger. When you commented on quad Bravo problem at separation, you were a little weak. Could you go through what you did after you noticed the talkback's barber pole again, please?
We copied the - the primary and secondary propellant talkbacks on SM RCS quad Bravo 1 to barber pole on separation.
Roger. Roger. That is affirmative, and we moved that switch to the Open position and they went back to gray. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger, Houston. Apollo 11. Go ahead.
Roger. Could you give us some comments on how the transposition and docking went? Over.
I thought it went pretty well, Houston, although I expect I used more gas than I've been using in the simulator. The turnaround maneuver - I went Pitch, Accel Command and started to pitch up, and then when I put the Manual Attitude, Pitch back to Rate Command, for some reason it - it stopped its pitch rate, and I had to go back to Accel Command and hit what I thought was an extra Proceed on the DSKY. Then, during the course of that, we drifted slightly further away from the S-IVB than I expected. I expected to be out about 66 feet. My guess would be I was around 100 or so; and therefore, I expect I used a bit more coming back in. But, except for using a little more gas - and I'd be interested in your numbers on that - everything went nominally.
This is Houston. Roger. We copy.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Go ahead, 11.
Rog. We're working on the pressurization of the LM now, and working off the decal with CSM-LM pressure equalization. And we're down to step 13, where we're waiting for the cabin pressure to be 5, or it should be roughly 5, before we turn the Repress package O2 valve to Fill. Instead of 5, we're running about 4.4. Over.
Roger. Stand by a second.
And Houston, Apollo 11. We did put the Repress package O2 valve to Fill momentarily there at step 13, and we have filled the bottles back up partially. What's the pressure reading there now, Neil?
We have about 450 psi now in the - in the three 1-pound bottles.
Roger. Stand by a second, please.
Roger. Standing by. And the Repress package valve is now in the Off position. What's the cabin pressure now, Buzz? Cabin pressure's now 4.5.
Houston, Apollo 11. We think these readings are within normal tolerances. We just wanted to get your concurrence before we press down any further with these decals.
Okay, CapCom.
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read?
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Rog. LM looks to be in pretty fine shape. About all we can see from here.
Okay. In reference to your question on this step 13 on the decal, I understand that you have used up the contents of the Repress O2 package and at that time, instead of being up to 5 psi, you were reading 4.4. Is that correct?
Okay. 4.4. Yes sir.
Okay. And you want to know if you can go ahead and use additional oxygen to bring the Command Module up to 5.0 and continue the equalization? Over.
Yes. We think it's within normal tolerances, Bruce. We just wanted to get your concurrence before we press on with this procedure.
Roger, Apollo 11. Go ahead.
Okay. We're pressing on with the procedure.
And 11, Houston. We have a request for you. On the Service Module secondary propellant fuel pressurization valve: as a precautionary measure, we'd like you to momentarily cycle the four switches to the Close position and then release. As you know, we have no TM or talkback on these valve positions, and it's conceivable that one of them might also have been moved into a different position by the shock of separation. Over.
Okay. Good idea. That's being done.
Houston. Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, Houston. We're doing a non-propulsive vent on the booster at the present time. You may see some sort of a cloud coming out of it. And when you're ready, I have your evasive maneuver PAD.
Rog, And it's coming out.
Roger. Out.
It's a haze. It's going by toward our minus-X direction, and several small particles are moving along with it. The actual velocity is fairly high - at least it appears to be high. And we've got an O2 high - flow high right now.
Houston. Roger. Out.
And Houston, you might be interested that out my left-hand window right now, I can observe the entire continent of North America, Alaska, over the Pole, down to the Yucatan Peninsula, Cuba, northern part of South America, and then I run out of window.
Roger, we copy.
Hay, Houston, Apollo 11. All 12 latches are locked.
Roger. 11, this is Houston. Understand 12 latches locked.
11, Houston. Whenever you're possessed of a free moment there, we've got this Evasive Maneuver PAD.
Okay.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11 is ready to copy.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Evasive Maneuver: SPS G&N; 63481, plus 0.95, minus 0.20; GETI 004:40:01.00; plus 0005.1, plus all balls, plus 0019.0; roll is your option; pitch, 213, 357; Noun 44 is NA; Delta-VT is 0019.7, 0:03, 0015.2. The rest of the PAD is NA. No ullage. LM weight, 33290. Readback. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Standing by for your readback. Over.
11, Houston. Do you read? Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
All of a sudden there, we had a little click, and the signal strength began to start dropping off. Your transmissions were cut off very abruptly. How do you read now?
Roger. Loud and clear. We had a handover to Madrid about the time I was - I guess halfway through the PAD. If you could give me the last value you read, I'll pick up there. Over.
Okay. Start with Delta-VZ. Over.
Roger. Delta-VZ is plus 0019.0; roll, your option; pitch, 213, 357; and Noun 44 is NA. Delta-VT 0019.7, 0:03, 0015.2. The rest of the PAD is NA, and no ullage. LM weight 33290. Read back. Over.
Roger, Houston. Evasive Maneuver, SPS G&N; 63481, plus 0.95, minus 0.20; 004:40:01.00; plus 0005.1, plus all zeros, plus 0019.0; roll, crew option, 213, 357; NA; 0019.7, 0:03, 0015.2; no ullage; LM weight, 33290. Over.
11, this is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11.
We'd like to arm our logic switches.
Go ahead with the logic.
Okay. Mark logic 1 and 2 armed.
Roger. We show the logic arm, and you're Go for Pyro arm.
Houston, we're ready for LM ejection.
Roger. You're Go for LM ejection.
Thank you.
Houston, we are Seped. We have a Cryo Press light.
Roger. Copy. Cryo Press light.
Roger, 11. We recommend you turn the O2 fans on manually and ensure that the O2 heaters are in the Automatic position.
Roger. O2 heaters are On, and we're going to cycle the O2 fans now.
Roger. O2 heaters to Auto, or you can watch them in the On position, and O2 fans manual On.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Roger. In reference to your question on RCS usage; it looks like you are about 18, maybe 20 pounds below nominal at the present time. No problem at all. Over.
Right.
I wanted to be 18 or 20 pounds above nominal, babe.
Sorry about that.
11, Houston. Your systems are looking good. We're standing by for the burn.
Houston, Apollo 11. Could you confirm that pitch gimbal motor number 1 turned off? We just shut all four off, and we got a questionable indication on the ECS on pitch 1.
Roger. Stand by a second.
Houston, did you copy our residuals?
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Stand by, please.
Go ahead, Houston. You copy our residuals?
Roger. We got 0.0 and 0.2, it looks like.
We had 0.1 while ago. It's - just went to 0.2.
(Laughing) Okay.
That EMS Delta-V counter is minus 4.0.
Minus 4.0. Roger.
And how about pitch gimbal 1? Can you confirm that Off?
Can you stand by just a second on that? At the present time we cannot confirm it Off. We saw a current drop indicating that several gimbal motors had gone off. We'll be back with you in just a second on it. Over.
Okay. If necessary, we can recycle it.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you go ahead and cycle pitch gimbal motor number 1 On and then Off and give us a Mark, and we'll tell you what we see. Over.
Okay, fine. It's coming back on. Ready.
Mark.
And it's going back off. Ready.
Mark.
And that time we got an onboard indication, Houston. Thank you a lot.
Roger. We confirm that it is Off.
Yeah. We do likewise.
Houston, Apollo 11. We're starting our maneuver to observe the S-IVB slingshot.
Roger, 11. We've got an updated attitude for you on the slingshot observation.
Okay. Say the angles please.
Roger. Roll 002.5, pitch 289.3, yaw 357.5, and there's also an update, minor correction, to your attitude for the P52. Over.
Roger. I have roll 2.5, pitch 289.3, and yaw 357.5. Over.
Roger. And for your P52 and optics calibration, it'll be roll 346.5, pitch 345.0, yaw 007.8. Over.
Roger. 346.5, 345.0, and 7.8. Thank you.
Houston. Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
Roger. We're going to go ahead and enable the S-IVB for the slingshot maneuver. The LOX dump will start about 12 minutes from now. Over.
Okay, LOX dump about - I guess that'll make it about 01, huh?
Right. I'll try to give you a little closer update as we approach it.
Alrighty.
And, 11, for you information, the magnitude of Midcourse Correction number 1, if we burn, looks like about 17 feet per second. We're presently considering not burning it. This would make midcourse correction 2 tomorrow about 21.3. Over.
That sounds good to us.
Roger. You're looking good down here.
Well, we didn't have much time, Houston, to talk to you about our views out the window when we were preparing for LM ejection; but up to that time, we had the entire northern part of the lighted hemisphere visible including North America, the North Atlantic and Europe and Northern Africa. We could see that the weather was good all - just about everywhere. There was one cyclonic depression in Northern Canada, in the Athabaska - probably east of Athabaska area. Greenland was clear, and it appeared to be we were seeing just the icecap in Greenland. All North Atlantic was pretty good; and Europe and Northern Africa seemed to be clear. Most of the United States was clear. There was a low - looked like a front stretching from the center of the country up across north of the Great Lakes and into Newfoundland.
Uh, roger. We copy.
I didn't know what I was looking at, but I sure did like it.
Okay. I guess the view must be pretty good from up there. We show you just roughly somewhere around 19,000 miles out now.
I didn't have much outside my window.
We'll get you into the PTC one of these days, and you take turns looking.
Houston, Apollo 11. We're - We've completed our maneuver to observe the slingshot attitude, but we don't see anything - no Earth and no S-IVB.
Roger. Stand by. In GET, I have a LOX dump start time for you. It's supposed to start at 5 plus 03 plus 07, and stop at 5 plus 04 plus 55. Ullage burn starts at 5 plus 37 plus 47, stops at 5 plus 42 plus 27. Over.
Roger, thank you.
11, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We now recommend the following attitude: roll 307.0, pitch 354.0, yaw 019.5. And the LOX dump has already been enabled, so we can't hold it off any longer.
That's okay. Go ahead. We'll maneuver around to 307, 354, and 19 and a half. Thank you sir.
Roger.
11, Houston. It doesn't look to us like you'll be able to make it around to this observation attitude in 2 minutes. We recommend that you save the fuel. Over.
Okay, Houston. We've - you got to us just a little late. Our maneuver's already begun, so it's going to cost us about the same amount of fuel to stop it, no matter where we stop it, and we may as well keep going.
Roger. Go ahead.
11, Houston. LOX dump initiated.
11, Houston. LOX dump has been terminated. Over.
Roger.
Rog. We still don't have it in sight.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. If you'll give us Accept and stay in P00, we'll set your trunnion bias to zero. And, I have a plan for balancing your oxygen cryos. Over.
You got it.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. We've got the, uh, what appears to be the S-IVB in sight, at, oh, I'd estimate a couple of miles away. It's at our number 5 window and the dump appears to be coming out of two radially opposite directions from the S-IVB.
Roger. They're continuing with the non-propulsive vent from the liquid oxygen tank. It would be radially opposite, there. And Booster tells me it's the continuous vent system. They're also dumping a small amount of fuel at this time. We've got about 23½ minutes or so until the APS burn. Over.
Roger.
11, Houston. We have a recommended configuration for your Cryo switches to even up the load between oxygen tanks 1 and 2. Over.
Okay. You're coming in very weakly there. We're recommending O2 tank 1 heater Off, O2 tank 2 heater to Auto, O2 tanks 1 and 2 fans both Off, H1 - H2 tank 1 heaters to Auto, and H2 tank 2 heaters to Off. Over.
Rog. We have that except the last one was H2 fans to Off. Is that affirm?
H2...
We have - the configuration we have now is, Hydrogen heaters: we got 1 Auto, 2 Off. Oxygen heaters; 1 Off, 2 Auto. And we have all the fans Off.
This is Houston. Roger. We concur. Out.
Eleven, this is Houston. We've completed the trunnion zero bias setting. You can retrieve the computer and go to Block.
Roger that. Thank you.
Eleven, this is Houston. With this maneuvering to observe the slingshot, I guess we missed copying your LM/CM Delta-P reading. Over.
Stand by. We'll give you a reading.
Roger.
Right now, reading 0.2, Bruce.
Roger. 0.2.
Okay, Mike. And could you verify that your waste compartment valve is in Vent, there?
Roger. Waste compartment valve has been in Vent for, oh, I guess, 45 minutes or so.
Roger. We copy.
If we're late in answering you, it's because we're munching sandwiches.
Roger. I wish I could do the same here.
Ah, don't leave the console!
Don't worry, I won't.
Flight doesn't like it.
How is Flight today?
Oh, he's doing quite well.
Houston, 11.
Go ahead, 11.
Down in the Control Center you might want to join us in wishing Dr. George Mueller a happy birthday.
Roger. We're standing by for your birthday greeting.
I think today is also the birthday of California, and I believe they are 200 years old, and we send them a happy birthday. And I think it's Dr. Mueller's birthday also, and don't think he's that old.
Roger. We copy. I'm looking back in the viewing room right now. I don't see him back there.
He may not be back from the Cape yet.
Roger. I believe Dr. Mueller is on his way back from the Cape. We'll relay his greetings for you.
Thank you.
Eleven, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. At your convenience, we'd like to get a waste-water dump to 5 per cent remaining. After completion of this one, the next waste-water dump will be at about GET equal to 25 hours. Over.
Coming on right now.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. You copy our torquing angles?
Roger. Leave them on there for another second, please.
Will do.
11, this is Houston. We copy the angles, but stand by before you go ahead and use them. Over.
Standing by.
11, Houston. We request that you re-do P52, and if the angles come out the same magnitude, go ahead and incorporate them. Over.
Okay. We'll do it.
They look a little large right now.
Yeah. Roll - roll looks a little large, especially, there.
Roger.
We're showing a waste-water quantity of about 13 percent on TM now, 11. Over.
Roger. It's off, now.
Roger. We copy.
Houston, Apollo 11. Torquing angles essentially the same, and we're going to go ahead and torque them now.
Roger. We concur.
Okay.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Could you give us a - an Auto optics check to a third star or a different star from the one you've been using?
Sure, be glad to. I can go back and do the whole thing and pick different stars.
I don't think there any - any need to do that. We'd just like to confirm it with a different star, since that roll angle was a little larger than we expected.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. I have a TLI-plus-11-hour PAD when you're ready to copy.
Wait one.
Old star number 30 looks like it's right dab smack in the middle of the sextant.
Houston. Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, ready to copy.
Roger, 11. This is a TLI plus 11 hour P37 format: 013:44, 4793, minus 165, 049:23. Read back. Over.
Roger. 1344 4793, minus 165, 049:23. Over.
This is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11.
Roger. Do you have any update for the roll, pitch and yaw angles on the top of page 37 in the Flight Plan, or are they still good?
That's for the optics calibration?
Yes, sir.
Yes, indeed. I'll give them to you in just a second here.
Roger, 11. For the optics calibration, I've got 346.5 for roll, 345.0 for pitch, and 007.8 for yaw. The pen-and-ink attitude corrections in your book for P23 are good. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
And we're going to hand over to Hawaii in about 5 or 6 seconds, here. We'll have a momentary Comm dropout.
Roger.
