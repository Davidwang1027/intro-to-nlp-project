Apollo 11, Apollo 11. Good morning from the Black Team. [Long pause.]
Good morning, Houston.
Good morning. We got about 2 minutes to LOS here, Mike.
[Garble] you guys wake up early.
(Laughing) Yeah, you're about 2 minutes early here on the wake-up. Looks like you're really sawing them away.
You're right. [Long pause.]
11, Houston. For planning purposes, you can go ahead and take the monocular into the LM with you.
Okay. I'll tell them. How are all the CSM systems looking? [Pause.]
11, Houston. Looks like the Command Module's been in good shape. Black Team has been watching it real closely for you.
We sure appreciate that. [Pause.] Cos I sure haven't.
Say again.
I say: Because I sure have not.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11. Thirty seconds. AOS will be 94 plus 21.
94:21.
He says good morning and take the monocular into the LM and AOS is 94:21.
Hey, why don't I turn on the hot water switch? Thank you [garble].
[Garble.]
[Garble] the LCG?
I think that baseline altitude has got the - the Foaming Sea altitude updated, isn't it? Huh? Yeah, well. I can tell you on a map where I marked [garble] the Foaming Sea.
I used zero. I input all zeroes in altitude. It actually came out minus. It's below sea level.
[Garble] those numbers right there behind you. Don't know if you see them. Minus 00177. Think that's 1.77 miles if I remember that - numbers right.
I can look it up. But they'll have some kind of correction to make to it so there isn't much point.
How much sleep did everybody get?
A - a good place for it. [Garble].
A good place for at least one of them is here where the toolkit and the PPK box in A-1 over here. This guy right there [garble].
Buzz, I'll put your [garble] stuff in the elephant trunk, okay?
[Garble] Buzz, what is it we're looking for?
[Garble.]
Yeah. 94:21
Now I can take care of all that stuff in the Flight Plan. I'm trying to get breakfast out of the way.
Apollo 11, Houston. Standing by. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, Houston. Go.
Roger. How do you read the Biomed in the LMP with the LCG on? Over.
Roger. Stand by one. [Long pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston. We have good data on all three crewmen. No. Belay that. The Commander we do not have yet.
Roger. He's not up just yet.
[Garble] some of these crater walls have scallops inside like a design in a fan, like feathers.
[Garble].
[Garble] very pretty. Very [garble].
Houston, Apollo 11. We just had a very good view of the landing site. We can pick out most all of the features we've identified previously.
11, Houston. Roger. Sounds real fine. And, 11, I have your maneuver PAD and consumables update whenever you want them. [Long pause.]
Stand by a little, please.
Roger. We're standing by. And that's the block data on the maneuver PAD, by the way.
Houston, Apollo 11 is a couple of minutes away from this rolling right 40 degrees to roll 122, pitch 229, yaw 0. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. We're standing by.
Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy.
Roger. Apollo 11, Houston. Here's your block data, TEI-30. Over.
Ready to copy.
SPS/G&N: 36639; your Noun 48, minus 0.72, plus 0.51; your Noun 33, 135:24:40.00; Noun 81, plus 3217.8, plus 0603.6, minus 0130.4; your pitch, 064. The rest is NA. Ullage; two jet, 16 seconds. And it's based on LOI REFSMMAT. Over. [Long pause.]
Roger. TEI-30, SPS/G&N: 36639; minus 0.72, plus 0.51; 135:24:40.00; plus 3217.8, plus 0603.6, minus 0130.4; pitch 064. Two jets, 16 seconds. LOI REFSMMAT. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Readback correct. Your consumables update? [Long pause.]
Yeah. Go ahead.
Roger. GET 91 plus 30, minus 7 percent; Alpha, minus 8; Bravo, minus 2.5; Charlie, minus 10; Delta, minus 6.5. H2 total, minus 2 pounds. Oxygen total, plus 9 pounds. Over.
Okay. Thank you. And on board, we're reading for Quad Alpha, 75 percent; Bravo, 78; Charlie, 78; and Delta, 77 percent.
11, Houston. We copy. [Pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston. I have your baseline altitude update now, if Buzz is ready to copy.
Go ahead.
Roger. Alpha 1 is 500, that's 500 feet above the landing site. Over.
Okay. Alpha 1 is 500 feet above the landing site. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 11. Our crew status report for sleep: CDR, 5.5; CMP, 6.0; LMP, 5.0. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. We have that now.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead.
Roger. The Black Bugle just arrived with some morning news briefs if you're ready.
Go ahead.
Roger.
[Garbled.]
Okay. Church services around the world today are mentioning Apollo 11 in their prayers. President Nixon's worship service at the White House is also dedicated to the mission, and our fellow astronaut, Frank Borman, is still in there pitching and will read the passage from Genesis which was read on Apollo 8 last Christmas. The Cabinet and members of Congress, with emphasis on the Senate and House Space Committees, have been invited, along with a number of other guests. Buzz, your son, Andy, got a tour of MSC yesterday. Your Uncle Bob Moon accompanied him on the visit which included the LRL. Among the...
[Garble.] Thank you.
Roger. Among the large headlines concerning Apollo this morning, is one asking that you watch for a lovely girl with a big rabbit. An ancient legend says a beautiful Chinese girl called Chang-O has been living there for 4,000 years. It seems she was banished to the Moon because she stole the pill of immortality from her husband. You might also look for her companion, a large Chinese rabbit, who is easy to spot since he is always standing on his hind feet in the shade of a cinnamon tree. The name of the rabbit is not reported.
Okay. We'll keep a close eye out for the bunny girl.
Roger. You residents of the spacecraft Columbia may be interested in knowing that today is Independence Day in the country of Colombia. [Pause.] Gloria Diaz of the Philippines was crowned Miss Universe last night. She defeated 60 other girls for the global beauty title. Miss Diaz is 18, with black hair and eyes, and measures 34½, 23, 34½. First runner-up was Miss Australia, followed by Miss Israel, and Miss Japan. [Pause.] While you're on your way back Tuesday night, the American and National League Allstars will be playing ball in Washington. Mel Stottlemyre of the Yankees is expected to be the American League's first pitcher. No one is predicting who will be first pitcher for the National League yet. They have nine on the roster. [Pause.] Even though research has certainly paid off in the space program, research doesn't always pay off, it seems. The Woodstream Corporation, parent company of the Animal Trap Company of America which has made more than a billion wooden spring mousetraps, reports that it built a better mousetrap but the world didn't beat a door to its pa... - didn't beat a path to its door. [Laughter in MCC.] As a matter of fact, the company had to go back to the old-fashioned kind. They said, "We should have spent more time researching housewives and less time researching mice." And the "Black Beag - Bugle" is all completed for the morning. [Long pause.]
Thanks very much. We appreciate the news. [Long pause.]
Black Team, we'll be looking for an interesting day with you all tomorrow.
Roger. We'll be going off here shortly, and we'll pick you up in the morning for sure.
Apollo 11, Houston. Three minutes to LOS. AOS at 96 plus 20.
Apollo 11. 96:20. Thank you.
I'll need to holler across to you to get the mission timers on. Do we want to check and get our two mission timers synced? What's this one read now? 82:50?
51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56...
Okay, this one is 1 second slow, down in the LEB.
Let's see, these things come in the Command Module don't they, those umbilicals?
[Garble.]
Well, we don't want them.
[Garble.]
Anyway, it compares.
[Garble.]
Well, we couldn't do that without switching - well, you can have them in here all the time.
[Garble] there's no way for me [garble] probe and drogue [garble] docking [garble].
No, I can't think that that'd be of significance between them - because why would you ever care to whether you'd hook them up again, if you came back and docked?
Here's this LCG check. "Verify [garble] stick visible in red or green band."
Yes. Not [garble] as it should be.
The red one comes out this far, and the green one's out further than that. The whole thing is only about that long. It's got to be in one or the other or you can't see it.
Having any luck there, Michael?
[Garble.]
You don't need to take - you're not taking your scissors over there?
No.
I've got [garble].
[Garble] pad. I'm going to have to take a leak here.
Yes, I guess I'd better take that pocket - and the purse. Tell you what. How about putting those tissues in that box that's got that spare camera in it?
Okay.
It'll be right handy on your side over there. Now where did the tissue box go?
You want to see if the computer agrees with that mission timer?
I did already.
Okay.
Can you hand me that purse and the - that bag of mine - and the checklist?
And if you'll take me off of suit power.
Okay. Suit power is Off. Audio is Off. Whoops - Sorry.
[Garble.]
Good.
About ready for a little help? [Garble] that.
What's that?
[Garble] I only have one [garble] left.
Okay. Oh, let's see, one small - blah.
[Humming]
Okay.
You want one?
[Garble.]
Yes.
[Garble.]
We've got a roll rate in. 0.3 degree roll rate. Now it's taking it out. Now it's taking it back out the other way.
[Garble.] Now, let's see.
I'll keep an eye on [garble] for you.
[Garble] on here.
Okay, I'm going on.
Okay.
What's that?
Did you repress, huh?
How come you don't [garble] LM power?
Okay. Stand by. You're on LM power. What?
What did he say?
[Garble.]
Oh, what time is it? It's 95:54.
Now, switch from Rate, High, to Rate, Low. But that might make it better and maybe a little bit worse.
[Garble.]
I guess that's right then, Neil. It rattles across the deadband at a fairly high rate.
[Garble.]
Alright.
[Garble.]
Sure as hell is.
I can't get that [garble].
This one - this one? That won't hurt it. [Garble.]
Stand by for some Master Alarms. I'm purging.
[Garble.]
Oh, [garble], Mike.
It's 96 hours even. 96 even and coming up on 40 seconds. Ready...
Mark it.
[Garble.]
Okay, 96:01. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
Mark...
96:01.
3, 4, 5.
Good.
Okay, stand by for more thruster firing here.
Is this...
No, this one's yours. You going to wear this for...
[Garble.]
Okay, I'm going to [garble] camera out of its way.
[Garble.]
Okay, I wouldn't be surprised. [Garble] all over this goddam stuff.
A three-ring circus. I got a fuel cell purge in progress and trying to set up cameras and brackets, watch an Auto maneuver, and...
Jesus Christ!
Normal, Normal.
Another Master Alarm coming.
Stand by for Master Alarm.
Neil, where's the voice tape recorder, you know?
Might be in the [garble].
Okay. Oh, you son of a bitch, you! Gah!
[Garble.]
[Garble?]
Can't get it [garble]. It's behind the [garble].
Yes.
[Garble] hard time getting anything down here [garble].
Okay.
You got some things up there.
Neil, all this food and stuff up here, you going to take with you, or drink, or eat?
No, I'll take [garble].
Okay. Chewing gum, you want any of that?
[Garble] concerned [garble].
Neil, I hate to bother you. Could you get my solo book out of R-1 there?
What?
My solo book out of R-1.
Solo book?
Yes. Look...
R-l?
Yes, it should be in R-1. Big frapping book, with a bunch of updates on the cover. Thank you, that's it. Appreciate it.
Neil, do you recall the highest rate you saw during this recent thruster activity? Did you say 0.4 or thereabouts?
What?
Do you recall the - any kind of body rates that you saw during that thruster activity? Didn't you say something about 0.4? Maybe - remember when the SCS was acting up?
Ah...
Hello, Columbia. Houston. Do you read? Over. [Long pause.]
Hello, Houston, this is Eagle. How do you read? Over.
Eagle, this is Houston. Are you calling? Over.
Roger. How do you read? Over.
Roger. Reading you about three-by, Buzz. A lot of noise on the loop. We think it's coming from Columbia, but we can't tell. We're unable to raise voice with him. Would he please go to High Gain. Over.
Okay. I'll have him go to High Gain. It's probably the glycol pump you hear in the background, and I'm up to the point where I turn on the IMU. Would you recommend I hold off here for a few minutes or go ahead and power up the IMU? Over.
Roger. Stand by.
Hey, get your High Gain working.
Houston [garble]. Over.
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Eagle, this is Houston. You can turn on the IMU. Over. [Long pause.]
Roger. Understand [garble].
Houston, this is Columbia. Over.
Columbia, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Houston, Columbia. Reading you loud and clear. How me? Over.
Hey, Buzz? How about...
Hello, Eagle. This is Houston. We've got a noisy downlink on the down-voice backup. Would you please select S-band Voice to Voice? Over.
Columbia, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Houston, Columbia. Reading you loud and clear. How me?
Rog. You're about three-by, Mike. We got a lot of noise in the background. It's clearing up now. Break. Eagle, Houston. Do you read? Over.
Houston, Eagle. About four-by-four. Go ahead.
Roger. Just getting a voice check. Say the page you're on in the activation checklist. Over.
Roger. I'm on page 27. Over.
Roger. Understand 27. We copy. Out. [Long pause.]
Columbia, this is Houston. Would you please give us P00 and Accept. We have a state vector for you. Over.
Stand by one.
Houston, Columbia. You have P00 and Accept, and how are you reading me now?
Roger. Understand, we have P00 and Accept. You're about three-by in - on the voice, Mike. Over.
Okay. You're coming in loud and clear, and I'm configured for normal voice. If you've got any switch changes, you wanna let me know?
Rog. We've got some noise somewhere in the system down here, I think. We're working on it. And I've got a 130 landmark update for you, and also a DAP load whenever you're ready to copy. Over.
Stand by one. [Long pause.]
Go ahead with the 130 update.
Roger, Mike. Coming at you with the 130. T1 is 98:37:35; T2, 98:42:44, 4 miles north. Over.
Okay. T1, 98:37:35; T2, 98:42:44; 4 miles north of track. And go ahead with your DAP load.
Roger. CSM weight, 36651; LM weight, 33627; pitch trim, minus 0.72; yaw trim, plus 0.51. Over.
36651, 33627, minus 0.72, plus 0.51. Over.
Both are good readbacks. Out.
Houston, Eagle. Are you satisfied with the LGC self test? Over.
Roger. Understand. You passed the LGC self test. Over.
Negative. I was asking you if you were satisfied with it. As far as I can tell, it's satisfactory. And also the primary Evap flow is actuated to number 1 at 96:05. Over.
Roger. Copy on the primary Evap. We've got the low bit rate, Buzz. We couldn't see that LGC self test. Over.
Okay. [Pause.]
Houston, Columbia. The docking tunnel index angle remains unchanged.
Roger. Copy. Out. [Long pause.]
Houston, Eagle is going to secondary transmitter/receiver and secondary power amplifier, and I'll check with you in 60 seconds. Over.
Roger. Stand by. We're standing by. Over.
Okay. [Pause.]
Columbia, Houston. We are through with the computer. You can go back to Block. Over. [Long pause.]
Houston, Eagle. On secondary transmitter/receiver and power amplifier, how do you read? Over. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Over.
Rog. Reading you five-by, Buzz. How me? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Out.
Rog. About - That's the same as before. Switching back to Primary.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Houston, Eagle. Back on Primary, and I'm ready to proceed with the steerable antenna activation.
Roger. We're standing by, Buzz. Go ahead. Over. [Pause.]
And I'll go to Biomed left - ah, right momentarily.
Roger.
Houston, Eagle. Got a very nice lock-on - lock-on on the steerable antenna, and you should be receiving Biomed right and PCM high. Over.
Rog, Eagle. We got you five-by. It's really beautiful. We've got the high bit rate and the Biomed. Out. [Pause.]
Eagle, Houston. Do you copy? Over.
Roger. Copy.
You got CMP on [unclear, may be IRIG] 5 and LMP on [unclear, may be IRIG] 7.
Houston, Eagle. For your information, we're doing the glycol pump check now.
Roger. Copy. [Long pause.]
And there's the secondary glycol pump.
Roger. [Long pause.]
And I'm on secondary, or number 2 pump right now, and I'll hold here for a couple of seconds and then switch back to number 1.
Roger.
Ap - Columbia, Houston. Over.
Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Columbia. We noticed the DAP configuration. We'd like you to turn off B3 and C4, Mike, and for register 2 in the DAP, we'd like all ones. Over. [Long pause.]
B3 and C4 are both O-F-F on panel 8, and I understand you want - Say again what you want on register 2.
Roger. In the DAP, we'd like you to load all ones. Over.
Alright. [Long pause.]
Columbia, Houston. Did you hit the Command Reset around - after LOS on the last pass? Over.
That's affirmative. When we were having difficulty getting you, Charlie, I pushed the Command Reset to make sure I had control of High Gain.
Roger. Thank you much. We're in good shape now. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Eagle. Can you tell me if you're picking up Biomed on the CDR now? Over.
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Eagle, Houston. We're not getting any Biomed from the CDR now. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Eagle, Houston. We got the Biomed on the Commander now. Over. [Pause.]
Very good. Thank you.
Houston, Eagle. We're ready for an E-memory dump if you are. Over.
Roger. We're ready. Go. [Long pause.]
Eagle, this is Houston. We see the optics zero switch on. Before you take some marks, don't forget to cycle it back off and on, and then on. Over.
Rog. Houston, Eagle here. I wish we had one of those optics. I'll tell Mike about it.
Roger, Columbia. Excuse me. Sorry about that.
Eagle, Houston. Could you give us a hack on the time that you switched to LM power and also verify that we're on Glycol Pump 1. Over. [Pause.]
This is Eagle. We're on Pump 1, stand by for the switch-over time.
Roger. [Long pause.]
The switch time to LM power is 95:54:00. Over.
Roger. Copy, Neil. Is Buzz back in the Columbia now? Over.
Yes. He is.
Rog. Thank you.
Hello, Columbia, this is Eagle on Simplex B. How do you read?
You're loud and clear in Simplex B, Neil.
Roger. Read you loud and clear. [Pause.]
Okay. Would you configure for Simplex A, please?
Roger. Going to Simplex A. [Long pause.]
Columbia, Eagle. How do you read on VHF-A?
Reading you loud and clear on A.
Roger. Read you loud and clear. [Pause.]
And I'm ready to get a time hack from you. Load the CSM time.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Do you want the TEphem first?
Let's get your clock first and then we'll get TEphem.
Okay.
Give me a time to load.
97:01:30. Correction on that, Neil. 97 - make that 97:03:30. [Long pause.]
Okay. I have 97:03:30 set in.
Okay. And you've got about a minute to go.
Okay. [Long pause.]
15 seconds to go. [Pause.] 10 - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Mark it.
97:03:30.
Got it. [Long pause.]
Okay. Let's do a 06 65 on my Mark. [Pause.]
Did you get that, Mike?
Standing by for your Mark.
Okay, 3, 2, 1.
Mark.
Okay. 97:04:03.86.
Okay. I'm within three-hundredths. That's within our ability to keep together, I think.
Right. [Long pause.]
Okay. Now you want to give me TEphem Verb 05, Noun 01, Enter?
Okay. I've got Verb 05, Noun 01, Enter. Going to 17 06, Enter.
Roger.
Are you ready to copy?
Go ahead.
Register 1, 5 balls. Register 2, 20017. Register 3, 20616. Over.
Understand R1, 5 zeros. R2, 20017. R3, 20616.
That's correct. [Long pause.]
And I'm standing by configured to record your PCM data. [Long pause.]
And I'm ready to start on a docked IMU coarse align when you are. And when you're ready, go Min Deadband, Att Hold.
Okay. Stand by.
We're Minimum Deadband, Attitude Hold. [Pause.]
Okay. Now I need your Noun 20. [Pause.]
Okay. I got Verb 06, Noun 20. Give me a Mark on it.
Okay.
Mark.
Register 1, plus 11202, plus 20741, plus 00211. Over.
Copy. 11202, 20741, 00211.
That's correct.
Eagle, Houston. That coarse align looked good to us. Over.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, Mike. Your Attitude Hold's no longer required.
Thank you.
Okay, Mike. I'd like to copy a Noun 20 again, [Verb] 06, Noun 20. Be on my Mark.
Standing by for your Mark.
3, 2, 1, stand by. [Pause.] Take it again.
Okay.
3, 2, 1.
Mark.
Okay, I read plus 11154, plus 20792, plus 00230. Over.
I get - You get 11154, 20792, 00230.
That's correct. [Long pause.]
Eagle, Houston. I...
Okay, Houston. Did you copy...
Eagle, Houston. We have the angles. I'll read 'em back. Over. For the Command Module; 11154, 20792, 00230. For the LM; 18995, 02852, 35863. Over.
That's correct for Eagle and Command Module.
Rog. [Pause.]
Did you get the time? Was 97:14:20.
Roger. Copy, Eagle. Out.
Columbia and Eagle - LOS for both spacecraft, 97:32; AOS, 98:18. Houston, out.
Eagle, Houston. We have your gyro torquing angles if you're ready to copy. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. We're ready to copy.
Roger. Eagle. For X, minus 00060; Y, plus 00620; Z, plus 01080. Over. [Long pause.]
Understand. X, minus 00060; Y, plus 00620; Z, plus 01080.
Roger, Eagle. Good read-back. Out.
Houston, this is Eagle. Do you want us to go ahead and do a Verb 42 at this time?
Stand by. That's affirmative, Eagle. We'd like you to go ahead and fine align. Over.
Okay. [Pause.]
Houston, Eagle, LMP. How do you read? Over.
Rog. Five-by, Buzz. How me? Over.
Oh, loud and clear. I'm going to be going through an ascent battery check. You want to check my Biomed briefly? Over.
Roger. Go ahead. [Long pause.]
Eagle, Houston. We got a good Biomed on you, Buzz. Over.
Okay. Let me know where it ought to be at this point.
Roger. You can stay there at that point. When we go LOS, we'd like you to go Off on the Biomed. Over.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Do you copy those angles, Houston. Torquing angles?
Roger. They're correct. You can torque. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. We have about 4 minutes to LOS. Next AOS 98:18. Over.
Eagle. Roger.
Columbia. Roger. [Long pause.]
Eagle, Columbia. [Pause.]
Columbia, Eagle. Go ahead.
Roger. The capture latches in the probe, are engaged in the drogue. Would you like to check them from your side?
Rog. Stand by. [Pause.]
Houston, Eagle. ED Battery A is 37.0 and Battery B is 36.9. Over.
Roger. Copy both of those, Buzz. Out. [Long pause.]
Eagle, Houston. We looked at the E-Memory. It's Go. Over.
Roger. E-Memory Go. [Long pause.]
Mike, the capture latches look good.
Thank you. [Pause.]
Eagle, Houston. We'd like you to go to the Omni antenna, and next AOS, we'd like you to be in forward. Over.
Roger. Going to - Which Omni do you want now, aft? [Long pause.]
Eagle, Houston. We'd like aft now and forward at AOS. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Thirty seconds to LOS. Both spacecraft looking good going over the hill. Out.
Eagle, Columbia.
Go ahead.
Roger. I'm getting ready to pre-load the probe. I'm going to disable all my roll thrusters. Would you please monitor my roll, your yaw?
Roger.
Eagle, Columbia.
Go ahead.
I got another "Verify Capture Latches Engaged" on my checklist. I've already pre-loaded the probe. It's sort of silly, but sort of your option whether you want to verify they're engaged or not.
Okay, we got the hatch all latched up now, and we're getting ready for pressure-integrity check. So, why don't you go ahead?
Okay.
Mike, let us know how you're coming up there now and then.
I'm doing just fine. I've cocked eight out of the 12 docking latches, and everything is going nominally.
Okay.
All 12 docking latches are cocked.
Okay.
And I'm ready to button up the hatch.
Hey, Mike. Have you got the - got to the tunnel vent step yet?
I'm just coming to that. What can I do for you?
Well, we're waiting on you.
Okay.
We're still ahead of the timeline, so take your time.
Okay.
Okay, I'm ready to go to LM tunnel vent.
You got it all vented now?
Negative, it's a slow process. I'm on Vent, but - it's just going to take a little while here.
Roger. Just give us a call. We're pressing on with some other stuff.
Okay.
How's our attitude holding?
Looks good.
Okay, this - this thing's supposed to take about 8 minutes. We've got about 3 of them gone, so in about another 5 minutes, I should be able to turn my thrusters back on.
Moving in.
How you doing, Mike?
Doing just fine. The - Stand by, I'll give you the Delta-P reading - 3.0. I need 3.5 before I can bring my thrusters back on.
Okay.
I've got a 3.5 psid now. I'm going to start a maneuver here in a few minutes to depressurize it.
Okay.
How you - how you guys doing?
Okay. We're doing our regulator checks now.
So I heard.
I'm starting the maneuver.
How long you got - to end this maneuver, Mike?
Oh, about another 2 or 3 minutes we should be there - no, less than that.
We're there. We're at the new attitude.
Okay, we're going to put our gear down.
[Garble] Master Arm...
Okay.
Landing Gear Deploy, Fire.
Here we go, Mike.
Bam, it's out. Ain't no doubt about that.
And it's gray.
Alright. Your ED Logic Power A, Closed.
Logic Power A, Closed.
Alright, fire it again.
Okay.
Nothing happened, huh?
Right.
Okay, now...
I heard it click.
Yeah, so did I.
That relay, I suppose.
Master Arm, Off.
It's Off.
CB(11), ED Landing Gear Flag, Open.
The gear went down okay, Mike.
Good deal.
Apollo 11, Houston. We're standing by. Over. [No answer.]
Columbia...
Columbia, Houston. Do you read? Over. [No answer.]
Loud and clear.
Eagle, Houston. Do you read? Over. [No answer.]
Columbia, do you read Eagle?
Eagle, do you read Columbia?
Yeah, I'm working on the High Gain right now.
Okay, I'm reading him loud and clear.
You in the right attitude, Mike?
That's affirm.
Columbia, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Houston, Columbia. You're loud and clear.
Eagle, Houston. No voice. Will you verify forward Omni? Over. [No answer.]
Houston, Eagle. Over.
Columbia, Houston. We have no voice with Eagle. Would you please verify that Eagle is on forward Omni. Over. [No answer.]
Buzz, you on the forward Omni?
Houston, Eagle. Over.
Buzz, are you on the forward Omni?
Roger. I am.
Houston, Columbia. Eagle is on the forward Omni.
Columbia, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Columbia, go ahead.
Eagle, Houston. Over.
Houston, Eagle. Go ahead.
Roger. Are you reading me, Buzz? Over.
Roger. I got you now. I fed in those angles for the S-band, and I couldn't get a lock-on. It appears as though the antenna would have to be looking through the LM in order to reach the Earth. Over.
Roger. We copied in the P22 attitude that you will not be able to get a High Gain lock-on. We have a DAP data load, if you're ready to copy. Over.
Roger. Ready to copy.
Okay. LM weight, 33627; CSM weight, 36651; pitch trim, 00470; roll trim, 00589. Over.
Roger. LM weight, 33627; CSM weight, 36651; pitch trim, 00470; roll trim, 00589. Over.
Roger, Buzz. That's a good read-back. You're about two-by with these Omnis in this configuration. We won't have very good Comm until we get through with the P22. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Houston, Columbia.
Eagle, Houston. Would you select S-Band Voice to Voice. Over. [Long pause.]
[Inaudible on air-ground] Roger. S-Band Voice to Voice. How do you read now?
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Houston, Columbia in Down Voice Backup. Do you read?
Roger. We read you. Columbia, did you call? Over.
Affirmative. Calling you in Down Voice Backup. How do you read me?
Rog. Better, Mike. We're reading you now about four-by. No voice at all with you earlier. Let's stay in this configuration. Eagle, are you in Voice mode? Over.
Roger. Eagle's in Voice mode. How do you read? Over.
Roger. You're about three-by now, Buzz. We're satisfied with this configuration. Let's stay where we are. Over.
Houston, Columbia's in Omni C, Charlie, Down Voice Backup and, when you get a chance, could you look up the coordinates of 130 for me, please? I have conflicting information between my cue card and my Flight Plan. I'd like to know which coordinates you want me to use.
Roger. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Houston, Eagle. Completed gear extension okay. [Long pause.]
Columbia, Houston. We're satisfied with what you already have loaded in P22 for these coordinates. Over.
Thank you, Houston.
Columbia, Houston. The coordinates you have loaded in P22 are - we have - are Site 130 prime. Do you concur? Over. [Pause.]
I have the coordinates loaded off the cue card which is - for crater 130. [Long pause.]
Columbia, Houston. We made an error on those coordinates. We'd like you to load for latitude in a Noun 89, plus 01243; longitude over 2, plus 11844; altitude, minus 00146 as shown in the Flight Plan. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Eagle, Houston. Could you give us an idea where you are in the activation? Over.
Rog. We're just sitting around waiting for something to do. We need a state vector, a REFSMMAT before we can proceed on with the AGS, and we need you to watch our DAP data load, gimbal drive check, and throttle test. Over.
Roger. Eagle, we'll have the state vectors and the REFSMMAT for you as soon as we get the High Gain. Over. It will be about another 10 minutes or so before we get through the P22, and when we maneuver to attitude and get the High Gain, we'll have the updates for you. Over.
Roger. We'll go ahead with the DAP and the throttle check since we don't have a gimbal drive test, okay?
Rog. Understand you're going to the DAP throttle - That's affirmative.
Houston, Columbia. Those T1 and T2 times are still good, aren't they?
Say again. Over.
I say, the T1 and T2 times remain unchanged, affirmative?
That's affirmative. Over.
Thank you.
Houston, Eagle.
Go ahead, Eagle. Over.
Rog. In accordance with the - on page 47, step 1, we had the guidance control in PGNS and Mode Control, PGNS, Auto. And, of course, the circuit breakers are not in on the thrusters yet, so when we started through the DAP and proceeded on Noun 46 - and we're looking at Noun 47 now - why, we got an RCS TCA light, and we've got four out of the eight other bright-colored red flags. I think that this is explained by the fact that we are in - PGNS and Auto and just unable to fire the thrusters. Over.
Roger. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Eagle, Houston. You are correct. The lights are there and the flags because we haven't closed the breakers yet. Over.
Roger. [Long pause.]
And Houston, Eagle. Are you going to need the High Gain before you can look at our GDA position indicator?
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Eagle, Houston. We can see all the throttle data...
I can give high...
Go ahead. Over.
I could give you high bit rate on the Omnis if that will help any.
Negative. We have all the throttle data we need. You can stay low bit rate. You can proceed through the throttle test, but do not do the gimbal trim. Over. Repeat, do not do the gimbal trim.
Roger. Understand. [Long pause.]
Boy, you just can't miss those check points, Diamondback and Sidewinder. [Long pause.]
Auto optics are pointed just a little bit north of crater 130.
Roger. Copy, Columbia. Out.
[Garble].
Houston, Eagle. We're ready to pressurize the RCS. Over.
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Eagle, Houston. You can go ahead with your RCS pressurization, but we would like to hold off on the RCS check-out until we get the high bit rate. Over.
Roger.
And Eagle, Houston. Have you deployed the landing gear yet? Over.
That's affirmative. The landing gear is out and gray.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Houston, Columbia. I've completed my marks. I've gone Accel Command in all three axes to prevent that thruster firing that last time.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Houston, Columbia. As soon as you have the necessary data on the downlink, let me know and I'll proceed.
Columbia, stand by on the Noun 49. Over.
Standing by, Houston. No rush. [Long pause.]
I will.
Columbia, Houston. We got the Noun 49. You can proceed. Over.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Colum - correction, Eagle, Houston. We see the Master Arm, you can go ahead and press. We see the press now. Over.
Roger. Looks good.
Roger, Buzz. If you've got - would like, I've got your AGS abort constants. Over.
Ready to copy.
Roger. For your AGS address 224, plus 60267; 225, plus 58148; 226, plus 70312; 227, minus 50031. Over.
Roger. 224, plus 60267; 225, plus 58148; 226, plus 70312; 227, minus 50031. Over.
Roger. Good read-back. Out. [Long pause.]
Eagle, Columbia. My P22 is complete. I'm continuing this maneuver to AGS CAL attitude.
Roger. Fine. We copy.
Roger.
Eagle, Columbia. Your High Gain angles are - Corrected - Eagle, Houston. Your High Gain angles are 165 pitch, yaw 66. Over. [Pause.]
[Very weak on air-ground] Roger. Columbia, Eagle. Have you about maneuvered there, yet?
Roger.
Negative.
[Inaudible on air-ground] Houston, Eagle. Are those angles for after the maneuver that Columbia is going to make or are they for right now? Over.
We have about another 120 degrees to go, Buzz.
[Inaudible on air-ground] Stand by about another...
Houston, Eagle. I believe I've got you on the High Gain Antenna now in high bit rate. Over.
Columbia, Houston. If you go to Reacq on the High Gain, we can acquire you now. Over. [Long pause.]
Eagle, Houston. We got some loads for you if you'll give us P00 and Data. Over.
You've got P00 and Data.
Rog. We've got both of you on the High Gains now. It sounds great now. Over.
Columbia.
Columbia. Rog.
Columbia, Houston. I have a SEP PAD if you're ready to copy. Over.
Stand by one. [Long pause.]
Ready to copy.
Roger, Mike. SEP PAD, RCS/G&N: Noun 47 and Noun 48 are NA; Noun 33, 100:39:50.00; Noun 81 is NA. Roll; 000, 007, 000. Rest of PAD is NA.
SEP, RCS/G&N at a TIG of 100:39:50, roll 0, pitch 007, yaw 0. Over.
Roger. Good readback. [Long pause.]
Houston, Eagle. Are you ready for us to start the RCS check-out now?
As soon as we finish the uplink. Stand by one. Over.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Houston, Columbia. Comment on P22. It worked just fine. The target I marked on is a small crater down inside crater 130, as described by John Young.
Rog. We copy. [Pause.]
Eagle, Houston. On our load - during our load, we had to do a Verb 96 to stop integration. We're going to start over again on this load. Over.
Eagle. Rog.
And, Eagle, here. I have read out address out of the AGS, 404, 405 and 406, and I had believed that 405 and 406 would both be all zeros, and I would propose maybe that I reset them to zero. I realize that 404 should be a negative number, and it is minus 13495. Over.
Roger. Copy. [Long pause.]
Eagle, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Buzz, we've got - The only thing we're missing here is the drift check. After we finish our load, we'd like you to do the drift check with Columbia. Over.
Go. [Long pause.]
Eagle, Houston. The 404, 405, 406 look fine to us. Over,
Roger. I'm going to be setting them to zero for the undocking. The question is do you want me to reset 405 and 406 back to the numbers that they are now, or can I leave them zero? I intend to set 404 to a minus 13495. Over.
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Eagle, Houston. We would like you to zero, as called out in the timeline, all three addresses, 404, 405, 406, before undocking. After undocking, you can load them back to the values that you have right now. Over.
Eagle. Roger. [Long pause.]
And, Houston, Eagle here. Both RCS helium pressures are reading 2,900. Over.
Copy. Out.
Eagle, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Rog, Buzz. Seems to be some confusion here on 405 and 406. We'd like you to zero them out prior to undocking, and after undocking you can - we'd like them still zeroed. Over.
Rog. I agree with that. Thank you.
Yep.
Eagle, Houston. We've got the load in, the - We have reselected P00. Your integration is going again for you, the computer is yours. We'd like to do the drift check now. Over.
Roger. In work.
Columbia, let's flick it in 06 20 when you're ready.
Standing by for your Mark, Neil. [Pause.]
Okay. 3, 2, 1.
Mark.
358.1 [corrects himself] .64, 020.73, 359.54. Over.
Copy. 358.64, 020.73 and 359.54.
That's correct. [Pause.]
Eagle, Houston. We've copied the angles and will read back if you are ready. Over.
Go ahead.
Rog, Neil.
For the CM - for Columbia: 35864, 02073, 35954.
For Eagle: 30374, 20078, 00053. Over.
That's correct, and GET was 99 hours and 4 minutes even.
Rog. Copy. Out. [Long pause.]
Eagle, Houston. Have you initialized the AGS yet? Over. [Pause.]
Negative. I haven't had a state vector yet.
Rog, Buzz. Have you done the 377 yet?
Roger. Standing by for your K-factor.
Roger. Stand by. [Pause.]
Columbia, Houston. We got a load for you. Could we have P00 and Accept? Over.
You got it.
Roger. Thank you, Mike. And break. Eagle, we've got a K-factor for you. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. Ready to copy.
Roger, Buzz. K-factor coming at you: 90 00 00 15. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. 90 00 00 15.
Rog. That's good. That's a good Enter there.
Eagle, Houston. We recommend the AGS initial - Well, we see it coming up now on the AGS initialization. Over.
Roger. [Pause.]
Eagle, Houston. After the AGS initialization, we'll be ready for the RCS checkout.
Roger. [Pause.]
Columbia, Houston. We got the load in. You can go back to Block.
Thank you.
Columbia, Houston. Did you get a - copy any LM data, low bit rate, behind the Moon? Over.
That's affirmative.
Roger. Stand by.
Or at least I've configured for it. I'm not sure Eagle sent it or not.
No, we did not send B-Data. Eagle. Over.
Roger. Copy.
Eagle, Houston. The alignment and the initialization look good to us. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 11, Houston. LOS is 99:30; next AOS, 100:16. Over. [Pause.]
100:16. Roger. [Long pause.]
Eagle, Columbia. Let me know when you come to your RCS hot-fire checks so I can disable my roll.
Wilco.
Rog. We're right there now. And we'd like you in - CSM in mid-deadband Att Hold. Over.
That's where I am.
And, Houston, you have high bit rate with us now, I believe? We're ready to proceed with the RCS checks.
Rog, Eagle. We're standing by. We're ready. Over.
Columbia, we'd like wide deadband Att Hold. Over.
Okay. Going wide deadband Att Hold. [Pause.]
You got it. [Pause.]
Are you going to do your hot-fire now?
Roger.
Okay. I'm disabling my roll. [Pause.]
Roll is disabled.
Roger.
I do believe you've got thrusters on board that vehicle. [Long pause.]
Give me a call just as soon as your hot-fire is complete, please.
Wilco.
Houston, Eagle. The RCS hot-fire is complete. How did you observe it? Over.
Stand by. [Pause.] Eagle, Houston. The RCS hot-fire looks super to us. We're all Go.
Roger. Mike, would you confirm that thruster B3 and C4 are Off? Over. And your radar transponder off.
C4 is Off, B3 is Off. Transponder is to Heater which is the same as being Off, and I've got my roll jets back on now.
And you're maneuvering. Right?
Will be shortly, Neil. [Pause.]
Apollo 11, Houston. We're Go for undocking. Over.
Roger. Understand.
[Garble].
Starting a trim maneuver to AGS CAL attitude.
Houston, Columbia.
Go ahead, Columbia. Over.
Roger. There'll be no television of the undocking. I have all available windows either full of heads or cameras, and I'm busy with other things.
We concur. Over.
Okay.
And, Eagle, Houston. We'd like you to select aft Omni now. It will be good for both LOS and AOS. Over.
Roger. Going to aft Omni.
Apollo 11, Houston. One minute to LOS.
Columbia. Rog.
How are Columbia's systems looking to you guys?.
