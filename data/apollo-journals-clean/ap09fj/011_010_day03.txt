Good morning, Apollo 9. Houston calling. [Long pause]
Good morning, Houston. Apollo 9.
Roger. I'm a long ways away, so you can't hit me for wake you up.
Say again.
I'm a long ways away, so you can't swing and bit me on waking up.
Okay. How's everything looking down there?
It's looked beautiful all night; kept it so quiet here that we didn't have too much to do.
Oh. Very good. [Pause]
I have a lot of good information here: Flight Plan update, consumables, and some block data when you get around to copying some of it.
Okay. Stand by one.
Okay, Houston. Go with your Flight Plan update.
Roger. At time about 39 plus 55, primary glycol accumulator refill. Fill to 50 to 55 percent, LMP 2 dash 7 step 4. Over. [Long pause]
Roger; understand.
[Garble] 39, plus 55 primary glycol accumulator refill; fill to 50 to 55 percent [garble]. [Pause]
LMP 2-7, step 4. Gumdrop.
Houston, 9. Did you get the readback?
Houston. Roger. Came through kind off weak, but it was okay. Change. Move S-band conference MSFN relay up to 44 plus 18 over Honeysuckle. Systems page 27. Over. [Long pause]
Okay. Move S-band conference MSFN S-band relay up to 44 plus 18 over Honeysuckle. Systems page 23. [Pause]
Roger. Next one: move CSM one-way relay up to 45 plus 38 over Carnarvon, Systems page 31. Over. [Long pause]
Roger. Move. CSM one-way relay up to 45 plus 38 over Carnarvon. Systems page 31. [Pause]
Roger. That's all of the general things. We're going to try to give your state vector and your reference - REFSMMATS; we'll send it over Guam at 40 plus 51.
Roger. 40 plus 51 for the state vector REFSMMATS.
Roger. And I have your consumables.
Roger. And the consumables. Okay.
GET 039 75 17 76 22 81 22 76 22 528 44 36 31 39. Over. [Pause]
Okay. 039 75 17 76 22 81 22 76 22 528 44 36 31 39.
9, Houston. Your readback is correct.
Roger.
Houston, 9. Did you want to go through the block-data, too?
Roger. I have it if you're ready.
Okay. Go.
Roger. 027 Alfa Charlie, plus 090, minus 0310 041 16 03 3529; 028 2 Alfa, plus 249, minus 0264 043 02 57 3001; 029 Alfa Charlie, plus 317, minus 0285 044 46 10 3569; 030 2 Charlie, plus 340, minus 0290 046 24 14 3859; 031 2 Charlie, plus 321 minus 0320 047 58 31 3859; 032 2 Bravo, plus 253, minus 0330 049 34 33 4358. Your SPS trim: pitch minus 0.9; yaw, minus 0.7. Over.
... [garble] rest of that mission and have the trouble postflight. Let me ask you two other quick things while we've got you on here and [garble]. Have you had any symptoms at all up there, Jim , any of you?
Symptoms of what?
Any - anything of the cold. You sound pretty nasal up there, and have you had anything that looks like any recurrence of your cold symptoms?
I don't believe so. My - my nose is stuffed. I'm going to slip some nose drops in this morning, but I expected that, and - Just let me check this.
No, Rusty doesn't have any symptoms of a cold.
And I don't have it at all, Chuck, at this date.
Good. Okay, Jim, it's no worse as far as you're concerned than it was in Gemini. Is that right?
Negative.
As a matter of fact, Jim opened up the nose drops yesterday, and we had enough fumes in here to clear everybody up within 10 minutes.
Very good. Listen, could we get a quick report on what you did for sleep yesterday and today? We didn't get that yesterday morning and we'll wipe it out right now, if you got a minute.
Okay, this is Jim. I got up - On the first night, I slept in about 10-minute stretches, very restless; and I don't know how much I got cumulative, maybe a couple of hours. Last night, I slept pretty good in about - Except I had one big 4-hour period, and I had another one of about 2 or 3 hours. I slept pretty well last night.
That's good. Your heart rate looks that way, Jim.
Okay, this is Dave. I slept the first night about four 1-1/2-hour cracks; and, last night, I guess I got about, oh, 7 hours total and about, maybe a couple of 3-hour stretches and another hour or hour-and-a-half stretch.
And all good?
Yes, it's all pretty good,
Good show. How about Rusty?
Rusty feels like he got a good 7 hours last night. As a matter of fact, he wanted to - he wondered when he woke up how long it had been since he went to sleep.
Good. How about the first night, Dave?
He says he thinks he got about 7 also, and he said he only woke up one time last night.
Okay, I think that - that clears us from here. We've still got some - some time there. Did any of you get any motion sickness in the - yesterday? [Pause]
This is Jim. Negative, I don't have any. Just a second.
Dave, negative.
Rusty says he took a Marezine this morning just to stay ahead of it. And he also, I guess, wanted you to know that he took a Seconal each night.
He did take a Seconal last [garble] or the [garble].
Both nights.
Yes, sir.
Tool - no, tool E up there is the one you need. They're both up by your shoulder.
Yes, I'm sure they'll want to watch it, and we got about 4 minutes before the time that he called.
Hey, this food even smells good this morning. I don't know whether I can smell it or not. It's all wrapped up. How can I smell it?
Oh, gee, that's nice.
Hey, can somebody reach the hot-water spigot down there?
Thank you. This is good old hot. I'm going to have me some hot chocky.
Well, Jim, we're not over a station. I guess they don't really care, so anytime you're ready, you can grab your tool E and proceed to the glycol accumulator fill; and I shall read you the checklist - a very long, difficult process.
You're not broadcasting to me. You're on PTT. That's alright. I can see your motion. Excellent! Ooh, that's nice.
Okay, step number 1: PRIMARY ACCUMULATOR FILL valve - ON! Let me see, we want to go to 50 to 55 percent; and right now we're about 35, so just turn it ON and I'll give you a call at 50, and we'll see how it stabilizes out. Okay?
Add more. Okay, turn if OFF. I figured that. Okay, turn it - you can turn it back ON. It just takes it awhile - It'll overshoot.
Okay, OFF.
Okay, back ON.
Okay, OFF.
Be ON just a tweek.
Okay, OFF. Beautiful. Well done. Now turn OFF, and that's all. Gee, you did a good job, Jim.
Okay, are you reading me now?
Yes.
Oh, yes [garble].
Okay, let's see, and the first thing we're going to have to do, is in 1 hour and 3 minutes is the P51, so that gives you an idea what we are in time.
Okay, fine.
Here you are. I'm going to go ahead and fill my other bags up right away.
Well - Why don't you keep - why don't you keep going? Why don't you keep - You want me to open this stuff for you?
Whew!
Too many things to hold on to here.
Okay? Why don't we get another one then?
What is that anyway? I never even heard of it. You cracked one?
Let's hope we get this squared away so we can get our update.
Think I'll take a couple of aspirins; just a touch of a sign of a headache - runny nose.
Get that? [Garble].
Huh?
Do you need anything down here, Dave?
No, not yet. I will in just a second, though.
Okay, I'm just waiting.
Get the other bag, too, Rusty - put the rest of the stuff in it.
Okay, got a RESTART this morning when we started the computer.
How about that?
Jim.
Yes?
I think [garble].
Oh, good.
Alright. I'll hand you the empty bag as soon as I drink my hot chocky.
Apollo 9, Houston through Ascension. [Long pause]
Apollo 9, Houston through Ascension. [Long pause]
Apollo 9, Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. If you haven't already done it, we'll set up our hydrogen tank 1 and 2 heaters to AUTO and the fans OFF for the day. [Long pause]
Okay. Heaters 1 and 2 to AUTO and the funs OFF.
Roger. And I have your block data if you're ready to copy.
Okay. Stand by one, please.
Roger. [Pause]
Houston, how long's this pass?
They got a keyhole; we only have about a minute and a half here yet.
Okay, Stand by. [Long pause]
Okay. Go ahead, Houston. How about starting with 28 dash 2A?
Roger. 028 dash 2A Alfa, plus 249, minus 0264 043 02 57 3001; 029 Alfa Charlie, plus 317, minus 0285 044 46 10 3569; 030 2 Charlie, plus 340, minus 0290 046 24 14 3859. And, 9, Houston. You still with me? Apollo 9, Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo 9, Houston.
Apollo 9, Houston through Guam.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 9. Go.
Roger. We see you have P00. Request ACCEPT.
Roger. You got ACCEPT.
Roger. We'll send your state vector and your REFSMMAT up to you.
Okay.
We might continue with block data when you get a chance there.
Okay. Stand by one, please.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Houston. Go.
Okay. I copied up through the DELTA-VC on 030 dash 2 Charlie. Do you want to go from there?
Roger. DELTA-VC on 030 dash 2 Charlie 3859 031 dash 2 Charlie, plus 321, minus 0320 047 58 31 3859; 032 2 Bravo, plus 253, minus 0330 049 34 33 4358. And your SPS trim: pitch minus 0.9, yaw minus 0.7. Over.
Roger. Understand. I'll read them all back to you if your ready.
Roger. Go.
How do you read now; you fading on me?
Roger. Loud and clear.
Okay. 027 Alfa Charlie, plus 090, minus 0310 041 16 03 3529; 028 dash 2 Alfa, plus 249, minus 0264 043 02 57 3001; 029 Alfa Charlie, plus 317, minus 0285 044 45 10 3569; 030 dash 2 Charlie, plus 340, minus 0290 046 24 14 3859; 031 dash 2 Charlie, plus 321, minus 0320 047 58 31 3859; 032 dash 2 Bravo, plus 253, minus 0330 049 34 33 4358. And I have for a pitch trim minus 0.9, and yaw trim minus 0.7.
Apollo 9, Houston. Your readback correct. [Pause]
Apollo 9, Houston. The computer is yours.
Okay. I understand. And did you copy all that?
Affirmative. Your readback was correct, and I have a NAV check for you.
NAV check. Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. 04200 00000, plus 2858, plus 00646 1126. And this is 30 minutes prior to NAV update. [Pause]
Roger. 042 0000, plus 2858, plus 0646 1126.
Apollo 9, Houston. You readback correct.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo 9, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 9. Go ahead.
Roger. I have a new CSM weight for your DAP data load.
Okay. Go.
Roger. CSM weight 30571. [Pause]
Apollo. Roger. 30571 for CSM weight.
Affirmative.
Apollo 9, Houston. I have your AOT star observation PAD.
Okay, stand by, please.
Wilco. [Long pause]
Okay. Houston, Apollo 9. Go with the AOT PAD.
Roger. GET 043 plus 55 plus 00; AOT detent 2; NAV star, 15 Sirius. CSM gimbal angles: roll 079, pitch 358, yaw 309. Comments: Earth in field of view until 43 plus 55. Over. [Pause]
Okay. Copy that. At 043:55:00; AOT detent 2; NAV star, Sirius 15. Roll 079, pitch 358, yaw 309. Earth in field of view until 43 plus 55.
Apollo 9, Houston. Correct.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Houston. Go.
Hey, when you sent us a REFSMMAT, did you put it in the preferred location?
Affirmative.
Okay. Thanks; just wanted to make sure.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston. About 1 minute to LOS. I've got some S-band antenna checks, gimbal angles, and times, if you want them.
Okay. I guess as good time as any.
Okay. The first one, GET: 44 plus 06 plus 00; pitch 188, yaw 070. GET: 44 plus 08 plus 00; pitch 169, yaw 044. GET: 44 plus 10 plus 00; pitch 159, yaw 017. [Pause]
Okay. S-band 44:06, pitch 188, yaw 070; 44:08, pitch 169, yaw 044, 44:10, pitch 159, yaw 017.
Roger. Correct. And Canaries at 52.
Apollo 9, Houston through Canaries.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 9. Go.
I read you loud and clear. Everything looks good down here. You bare a G0 for IVT.
Roger. I understand c GO for IVT. Thank you. We're mushing along.
Roger.
Apollo 9. Houston. One minute to LOS. S-band up for Honeysuckle at 37, will try ARIA at 29.
Roger. Honeysuckle at 37 and ARIA at 29, and S-band up at Honeysuckle.
Roger. [Pause]
Have a good day. Will see you this evening.
Okay. Thank you, Ron.
Roger.
Roger. Apollo 9, this is Houston through ARIA 1. How do you read?
Apollo 9, this is Houston through Honeysuckle. [Pause]
Roger. Houston, this is Apollo 9 here. Go ahead.
Roger. Copy. We're just standing by.
Okay. We're still trying to do a P51 here. We haven't started clearing the tunnel, so we're running quite a bit late.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. We'll see you over Mercury in about 3 minutes.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston. We've got you through Mercury.
Houston, Apollo 9. Say again.
Roger. We've got you through the Mercury solid; have you for about another 8-1/2 minutes.
Roger. We've just completed a P51 and 52, and we'll be mushing on.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go, Apollo 9.
Roger. We're going to be pretty busy here for the next few minutes. If you see us getting toward gimbal lock, let us know.
Roger. We'll only have contact with you for the next 3 minutes, and then our next station is Antigua at 17. [Pause]
Okay.
Apollo 9, this is Houston through Antigua. Standing by.
Okay, Houston. We have the tunnel clear now, and we're starting the transfer.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, the docking tunnel index angle is plus 2.1.
Roger. Copy plus 2.1. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go, Apollo 9.
Since we're running so far late here, you might take a look at the Flight Plan and see what needs to be changed, I haven't had time to do that.
Roger. We're working on that now. We can give you some recommendations later on.
Roger. [Long pause]
Houston, just for your info, tunnel clearing went pretty much according to plan.
Roger. I understand that tunnel clearing went real well and just for info, we're looking ahead. We're just saying press right on down the line right now, Jim, and we may just slip the docked DPS the REV.
But I think with your activity in there, you may just make up a good bit of this time. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go ahead. [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go ahead, Apollo 9. Houston is reading you loud and clear.
Roger. Another little piece of info for you. The drogue looks as good as new. There was a very small pencil line about 4 inches long, and that's about all we could see on it.
Roger, Apollo 9. Copy.
This is Apollo, Houston. Apollo 9.
Go, Apollo 9.
One little problem we might advise you of here, you might think about it. On the optics on the drive - The manual drive of the optics, the shaft seems to hang up around 64 degrees when you try to drive it manually. Seems to drive okay automatically. The feedback, the readout on the LEB, the mechanical readout is frozen at 64 degrees. The numbers read 64.0, and we haven't been able to get that to move since yesterday. Once you get past the 64-degreemark, it seems to work okay.
Roger, Apollo 9 Houston copies.
Okay.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. We'd like to have you bring up your S-band volume; we'll be working Madrid.
Roger. S-Band up.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go, Apollo 9.
Okay. I've got the gyro torquing angles for the P52 if you're ready to copy.
Go ahead.
GET: 42:48:00, minus 01172, minus 00 099, plus 00413. [Pause]
Roger, Apollo 9. I copied those. Thank you. [Pause]
Okay.
Okay. Apollo 9, Houston. We're going to lose you at Madrid in about a minute, and we'll see you over Carnarvon at 04.
Gumdrop, Spider. How do you read?
[Garble].
You're terrible. I got all kinds of noise here and I can't seem to squelch it out.
I got the squelches all the way up.
Same. Let me try my other PTT here. Okay, how do you read that?
Okay, fine. I'm going to try the VOX now.
Roger. 1, 2, 3, [garble]; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Okay. How about-now?
Okay. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Now, I'm going to switch antennas here.
Okay. I still got all kinds of noise; how do you read me?
[Garble] you switching antennas.
That's a little bit louder, but I still got all the noise. Stand by.
Wait a minute. That's probably S-band noise. Let me turn down my S-band.
Guess what. That was all S-band noise.
Okay. I'm going back on the other antenna. How's that now?
[Garble] 5 square. Let's just stay here.
Yes, I do have the tape on.
Okay. Stand by. VHF B SQUELCH coming down.
There it is. I've got it set on about 4-1/2.
Okay. You ready to go over to A?
Let's go Simplex A.
Okay. How do you read on Simplex A?
[Garble] square.
Okay, how do you read on SIMPLEX A?
Five square.
VEF B transmitter has come - I mean VHF B transmitter is sensational.
Your - Spider, this Gumdrop. Do you read? [Pause]
We want the tape off now also, right?
Gumdrop, Spider.
Go ahead, Spider. Gumdrop here.
Roger. Do you want the tape off now, also?
It doesn't say so. Seems like a good idea, though.
Yes. Tape coming off.
And, Spider, Gumdrop...
Okay. We're configuring the CSM for the ...
Go ahead, Jim.
... LM data, and we want you to go to TELEMETRY LOW.
Roger. We're TELEMETRY LOW.
VHG B transmitter to DATA and VHF B receiver OFF.
Roger. Got it.
Okay. We've already done the antenna checks.
Just a second.
Spider, this is Houston. Could you give us high bit rate, please?
Roger, Houston, Spider. High bit rate. How do you read, Houston?
I read you five-square. And, Gumdrop, I'm copying you five-by-five.
Roger.
Okay. I've got the tape off here now. Was there any noticeable difference between the antennas?
Oh, a little bit, but I had a lot of noise in the S-band when I tried it.
Okay. Let's just stay where we are; this is good over here.
Roger. Good here, too.
Okay. I'm going to be coming over now, so I'll see you in a minute.
Okay. Now wait a minute. I've got to get my hose hooked up here, Jim.
Roger.
Gumdrop?
Go ahead.
Roger. We're going to have to transfer me onto the ECS first. First few steps there are mine, I think.
Okay. Let me go back here and get these. [Pause]
Yes. When you get ready to transfer over, let us know; we'll turn your suit flow off.
Okay, standby. Let me advise.
Okay.
Gumdrop, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We're trying to do a little planning here. We'd like to have your opinion on how you're doing on the timeline. And we're looking, trying to size up whether or not you're more than an hour behind it.
Just a minute, and let me see. We're just about ready to start the CDR transfer, which is supposed to take place at 43:08, and we're at 44:06.
[Garble] to my suit, there, [garble] Gumdrop.
Okay. Just a minute. We'll get if off. So we're running just about an hour behind.
Okay. Copied.
We haven't run into any glitches yet, so we're going right along here. Maybe we can pick up some time here in a minute.
Roger. Copy.
It's okay, Rusty; suit flow coming off now.
Okay. [Long pause]
Okay. Then the LMP's supposed to take his suit isolation valve and let his suit flow when you get plugged in? [Pause]
Okay [garble] I'm in suit flow.
You're in suit flow. Okay we'll [garble] the umbilical here.
Okay, we're going to pass the ISO over to you in just a minute, soon as we get the ...
All right.
Spider, Houston. We'd like to have DFI ON when able.
And did you get that, Rusty? They want the DFI ON. And, Spider, configure the cabin with the straps, utility lights, [garble], and restraints.
Okay, Houston. We got the DFI ON, and be advised we had a MASTER ALARM with DFI ON, and I don't have any other lights on.
Roger. Copy. [Pause]
Okay. And I'm going to disconnect here. I'll be on my way over in a minute, Rusty.
Okay. Stand by. Okay. I'm ready.
Okay. I'll put the checklist away, and I'll take my helmet off and be over in a minute.
Spider, Houston. When you get a chance, we'd like to have the DFI OFF; we're heating up the glycol a little bit.
Roger. I'll be with you in just a second.
Roger. And, Gumdrop and Spider, like to ensure S-band volume, up. We're going over to Honeysuckle shortly.
[Garble]. Gumdrop.
And, Houston, this is Spider.
Go.
Roger. For your information, the SUPERCRIT pressure is reading zero at the moment.
Roger. Copy. We're reading 686, Spider.
Okay. [Long pause]
Houston, Gumdrop.
Go, Gumdrop. [Pause]
Go ahead, Gumdrop. Houston here. [Long pause]
Houston, Gumdrop.
Gumdrop, Houston. I'm reading you loud and clear. Go ahead.
Okay. The noise is gone now. Would you keep an eye on the gimbal angles, please?
That's affirmative. We'll watch them for you. And we'll have you over Honeysuckle here for 10 minutes.
Very well. Thank you. [Long pause]
Houston, Spider.
Go, Spider.
Spider, Houston. I'm reading you loud and clear. [Pause]
Spider, Gumdrop. He's reading you. [Pause]
Spider, this is Houston. I'm reading you loud and clear. [Pause]
Spider, Gumdrop. [Pause]
He reads you five-by. [Long pause]
Houston, Gumdrop. Did you copy to Spider?
That's negative, Gumdrop. Maybe you'd better relay it.
DFI is OFF, and the R and D is OPEN.
Roger. Copy. [Pause]
And, Gumdrop, you're 30 degrees yaw. We're watching it for you.
Okay. Thanks. [Long pause]
And, Spider, Houston. We'd like to have R and D instrumentation circuit breaker Baker IN as soon as you can. [Pause]
Spider, Gumdrop. R and D instrumentation circuit breaker Baker IN when you have a chance. [Pause]
You say it is IN?
Okay. Thank you, Gumdrop.
And, Gumdrop, you're 40 degrees yaw. We're watching it.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, this is Spider. If you read, be advised, that we got good signal strength on S-band, but we're getting some static and a steady tone.
Roger, Spider. And we're reading you loud and clear now. Honeysuckle had you on a side lobe. We've got you in good voice, and we're getting data. [Long pause]
Hello, Gumdrop. This is Spider. How do you read?
Five-square. How me?
Loud and clear. Let me check a couple of the other buttons here.
Okay.
How do you read me on this one?
Five-square.
Okay. Let me try [garble] check the VOX. [Long pause]
Hello, Gumdrop. This is Spider. How do you read?
Sounds good.
Do you read me now, all right?
Five-square.
That's good.
And, Gumdrop, Houston. Copied all three of those. You're coming through loud and clear, Jim. [Pause]
And, Gumdrop, this is Houston.
Go.
We're going to drop off with Honeysuckle, here. You've got 60 degrees, and you've got about a tenth of a second rate. [Long pause]
Gumdrop. Houston. You've got about 60 degrees of yaw.
Who's in the tunnel now?
Stand by. We're going to check [garble].
Okay.
[Garble] Spider [garble]. [Long pause]
Spider and Gumdrop, we've got you trough Mercury now. [Pause]
Roger, Houston. Spider here. How do you read?
I'm reading you okay, Spider.
Okay. We sure had a lot of static and noise coming up on the S-band there over Carnarvon. [Pause]
Or make that Honeysuckle.
Roger, Spider. We'll try to solve that. You were coming through here loud and clear after we got a main lobe lock on. [Pause]
[Garble] all. I had a keyhole static and a steady high tone on it. [Pause]
Roger. Understand you had a high tone. [Pause]
And, Gumdrop, we're showing you at 60 degrees.
Roger. Thanks. I've got a hold of it now, and I think the trend looks like we'll clear it fine.
Roger. Thanks.
And, Gumdrop to Spider.
Go ahead.
Roger, we're ready to start reinstalling.
Okay. Drogue's in. [Long pause]
Okay, tape, we're starting the hatch installation and it's 44:27:00. Starting the tunnel closeout I should say.
Dave, I don't guess you'll need me for anything, do you? Oh, shoot, he can't read me.
Dave, I guess you don't need me for anything more in the tunnel here. I'll go ahead and close up our hatch.
I'd like for you to check the capture latches.
Okay.
I'm up here waiting for you.
Be right up.
Yes. I see your problem.
Boy, I tell you these hoses are really something.
Sure getting a lot of noise on the S-band.
Are we?
Houston, Spider.
Go, Spider.
Roger. We're picking up an awful lot of noise and static on the S-band again here.
Roger. Understand. Gumdrop, are you getting it also?
Roger. Not bad. [Pause]
Did you say you were not getting it bad there?
No, I'm not getting it bad; Gumdrop sounds clear. Sounds like your standard S-band pass, Houston.
Okay. Copy that. Did you copy, Spider?
Yes [garble] I copied.
Okay, Davy. I'm right here.
Okay. [Long pause]
Okay. That looks like it did it.
Okay. I give a pull, and it feels solid.
Yes. On all three [garble].
Okay.
Fine. See you later; I'm going to close the door.
All righty. Have a nice time.
We will.
I'll get dinner ready when you're ready.
Man, am I hungry! [Long pause]
Okay, let's go back to - oop. Where did the clip go that was on it?
I don't know.
Well, shoot. Well, I'll let you read it to me.
Okay, you got the hatch closed?
No, I haven't. Is that - Is that's - what's next? Close the hatch; is that next?
Houston, Gumdrop.
Go, Gumdrop.
Right.
How much longer do we have you here?
Okay. We're going to have you here for about another 3 minutes, and then we're coming up over Antigua at about 53. And I would like to pass to Spider, also, that we would like to try to pick up a nominal Flight Plan at Antigua with the secondary S-Band check. We are recommending eliminating the COMM checks and whatever you have to do to pick up the Flight Plan at that time. [Pause]
Tell him I think that's a great idea.
Okay, Houston. We read you. This is Spider.
Okay.
What time is that pass at Antigua?
Okay. Antigua will be at 53.
Roger. We'll be ready for you.
Okay.
Gumdrop copies.
And, Spider, we have no good data for that AOT star visibility check. We'll have to eliminate that, and so you could leave your rendezvous radar stowed if you want to. [Pause]
[Garble] ...
Roger. Understand.
And we'll see you over Antigua, docking on ready. [Pause]
Okay, what ...
Okay [garble].
The hatch is closed and locked.
Roger.
And, Gumdrop, I know with all the activity I'd like to remind you of your CO2 cartridge change that's due at 44:10.
Roger. I'll have to get the tunnel closed up first, but I'll get it first chance.
Why don't you read the rest of it, Rusty?
Roger. No sweat. I just wanted to pass it to you.
Okay.
Okay. Thank you. [Pause]
CABIN DUMP VALVE to AUTO.
CABIN DUMP VALVE going to AUTO.
Spider, this is Houston. Would you go low bit rate?
Okay. CABIN REPRESS to AUTO.
Roger. Go on low bit rate.
CABIN REPRESS to AUTO. Clunk. Okay, we're AUTO.
Boy, we got a lot of nuts and bolts around this thing.
Yes [garble] we sure do. Okay, CABIN REPRESS is AUTO.
Okay, PRESS REGS A and B to CABIN.
PRESS REGS A and B to CABIN. PRESS REG A; PRESS REG B, CABIN.
Okay, CABIN FAN CONTROL, CLOSE. Got it.
Okay.
Look at this washer.
Yes. Well, that's a good place for it. Okay, what's next?
Okay. Glycol pump check.
Okay.
Except that's supposed to be done over the ground.
Well ...
That's desirable over the ground, but not mandatory.
Let's do it. Let's do it now.
R&D INSTRUMENTATION A, CLOSE. They might be ON; go ahead and do it.
R&D INSTRUMENTATION A, CLOSE.

Okay. What was that? That was DFI POWER, ON.
No, that was MAS - that was GLYCOL PUMP 1, OPEN. I got that.
Oh, okay.
Why don't we have a component light on there?
Because you didn't push in the circuit breaker yet. GLYCOL PUMP 1, CLOSED.
Oh, yes.
Okay, we got the component light. INSTRUMENTATION, SECONDARY.
Okay.
Okay, and it's 7. Wow!
It really comes on, doesn't it.
Good.

Okay, ON.
Maybe you turn that DFI on, it heats the glycol up to the point where it puts on the light.
Huh!
Okay, go ahead.
Okay ...
DFI POWER, OFF.
DFI POWER, OFF. R&D INSTRUMENTATION A, OPEN.
A, OPEN.
Ohhhh, boy. This tape re - You want to get this stuff behind me?
Sure, I'll get all that stuff, Rusty. You just read it to me, I'll [garble].
Okay, SUIT GAS DIVERTER. Pull to EGRESS. This is - a pressure integrity check.
PULL/EGRESS.
CABIN GAS RETURN to EGRESS.
CABIN - Oh, CABIN GAS RETURN, EGRESS. Roger, EGRESS.
SUIT RELEASE, CLOSE.
CLOSE.
PRESS REG A, CLOSE.
PRESS REG A, going CLOSED.
PRESS REG B, DIRECT O2.
DIRECT O2. Okay, you ready?
Ready.
How you feeling? Okay? Alrighty. If you start feeling ragged, give me a holler and I'll just let you rest.
Okay, you want to go to CLOSE, when we get to 8.85.
I can't see it very well.
Okay, I'll - I'll let you know. We're at 8 now.
Okay.
Okay, that's 8.85, essentially.
Alrighty, CLOSE.
Okay, the timer is counting. I'm reading 4.01, or something like that.
I'm 4.05.
Okay.
[Garble] a minute we want to read it again. Should be less than 0.3. And you want to go - CO2 CANISTER to SECONDARY, right away.
Okay.
Boy, my throat is really dry.
Yes, mine too. I'd sure like to get some water and something to eat.
I don't know if I'm hungry or not.
Yes, my stomach is just dead [garble].
Okay, I'm reading 3.95.
Yes, me too.
Okay, you got about 5 more seconds. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
Go to SECONDARY.
SECONDARY.
Okay, and it's reading 3.75 now.
Yes.
And we'll time that.
It felt nice and cool over here in the LM when I came over - with my helmet off.
The temp is 68. Another 30 seconds.
That's going to make it, too.
[Garble] seconds.
Okay.
And at that point, let me tell you what you're going to do.
Okay, time's up.
Okay, and it made it. CO2 CANISTERS, SELECT, PRIME.
PRIME.
[Garble] lights, OFF. SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF to AUTO.

And SUIT GAS DIVERTER, PUSH to CABIN.
Okay. Ready?
Ready. Wow! That's like, now.
Yes.
SUIT CONTROL - Okay, I'd the better get out a pen here. That's in FULL COLD on the SUIT and NORMAL on the CABIN.
FULL COLD on the SUIT, let's see this ...
No, that's where it is; I'm ...
Oh. Okay.
... not asking you to put it there.
Okay, regulator check is next. Let me see what ...
Yes, we have about 12 minutes. Why don't we configure the S-band so that we're ready to support that thing? And then come back and we'll start the REG checks and stuff like that. We can pick these up later.
Okay. As a matter of fact, if we don't have to use this card anymore ...
[Garble] have any steerable antennas, so he wanted the backup voice, okay?
He what? I thought they wanted secondary S-band check at Antigua on the Flight Plan? Right here.
[Garble] the secondary S-band checks.
Yes.
Okay. We'll be ready to pick them up.
Okay. Very good. Clip, hot dog. Alright, and we're ...
Why don't we do the ascent battery activation and checkout, right now?
Yes, we just did the pressure integrity check.
Yes, we can catch that regulator check some other time.
Yes.
Let's see, that's the thing we have the new checksheet for, isn't it?
Yes, I know what it is, if you want me to just go ahead and do it.
Okay. Why don't you.
Okay. DESCENT ECA CONTROL, CLOSED. Excuse me, ASCENT ECA CONTROL, CLOSED.
Yes, here it is - here it is here - ASCENT ECA CONTROL, CLOSED; PYRO TEMP MONITOR, BAT 5.
Okay, 5.
BAT 5, NORMAL FEED, ON ...
Ney, how about turning up the EL? Okay. Thank you. Okay, 5 coming on.
What in heaven's name is that?
It's on. Going to 6. 6 is ON. Okay, now - 1, 2, 3, 4, OFF. Right?
Right, yes.
Okay, 1, OFF.
2 going OFF.
3 going OFF.
4 going OFF.
And the current should be zero.
Okay, let me look at BATS 5 and 6. 5 is reading 27; 6 is reading 24. [Garble] pretty good. Okay, now we go to BACKUP FEEDS, right?
Yes, BACKUP FEEDS, both, ON.
PRIMARY FEEDS, OFF.
PRIMARY FEEDS, both, OFF; RESET.
Okay, looks the same.
[Garble] back ON.
Roger. BATS coming back ON, then.
ON ...
Go ahead, Gumdrop.
Okay, the hatch is closed up; the probe works real good; the hatch works good. I'll just put the tunnel in DELTA-T, unless you want to run it in LM PRESS.
We're pressurizing ourselves over here now, Dave. Hey, were you getting a lot of noise on VHF, then?
No, but I seem to have a lot of noise - flow noise in here now.
Okay, I was getting an awful lot of static all of a sudden there.
Okay, when you get all those back on, Rusty.
A is 36.8. [Garble] 37.5.
What's that? Oh ...
PYRO A ...
PYRO B.
... and B.
Okay. Say that again. I'll write it down.
Okay, I'll get it here.
What is it? I got the pencil here, Rusty.
36.8, 37.5. [Garble] going to take this one back in now.
Okay.
Alrighthy. We got that done.
Daylight AOT star visibility check. Oh, we're not going to get that done. I wonder what it looks like out through there?
Okay, Jim, you want to vent the tunnel, or do you want to leave it full?
It doesn't make any difference, Dave, I don't think.
Well, when we make our REG checks ...
Yes ...
[Garble] hatch the [garble] check is to vent the tunnel.
Okay, why don't you go ahead and vent it?
Okay, we'll see how it works.
Are you going to suggest whether ...
Is your dump valve in AUTO?
Roger, we're all configured.
Okay.
Okay, we pick up the Antigua at 53, right?
Roger.
We have 7 minutes. Let's do something useful. You want to start that REG check?
'What the hell is that out there [garble] the tunnel. Well ...
I don't know. That REG check takes us up and down here.
Yes.
Stay in BACKUP VOICE; S-band steerable antenna check - we don't need that.
We've done the glycol pump check, haven't we?
Yes.
[Garble], get that checked off.
We have the window shades on yet? Drogues and probe installation, OPS check and LM OVERHEAD HATCH, CLOSED; we've done that. Done that.
Let's just stand by until we get to Antigua.
Why don't you look ahead of that, Jim; and see what we can do?
Well, we got to get the PLSS out. Get the PLSS PREP, install the ISA. Wonder where we install that?
Hey, stow the - stow the OPS.
Oh, yes, that's what we didn't do.
Yes. And get these helmets out of here. That's what - that's something we can do. Tell you, I wish I could help you, but I don't ...
Yes, that's okay. You can help me more by just being able to continue reading the checklist. [Garble] straps that go - around this thing here. For the ...
Hello, Spider. This is Houston. How do you read?
You're five-square, Houston. How me?
Oh, you're coming in great, Spider. How are you doing? [Pause]
And, Spider, we're standing by for the secondary S-band check at your convenience.
Roger. Power AMP going off now.
Roger. [Long pause]
Tape, ON ... Okay, tape, we're doing the secondary S-band check. And it's - 44:54:20.
And, Houston, Gumdrop here. The tunnel is closed off, and everything works just like it should.
Roger, Gumdrop. Thank you, [Pause]
And, Houston, this is Spider. How do you read?
We're reading you loud and clear, Spider. We've had data drop out here; let's hang loose and see if we can get our data check.
Roger. [Pause]
I could hear your data drop out.
Very good. [Pause]
And, Spider, this is Houston. Could you give us high bit rate?
Roger. Going high. [Long pause]
Okay, Spider. We'll have to hang loose here for a minute. I'm getting your VHF down. We don't have a good lock on S-band.
Roger. [Pause]
And while we are waiting, could you comment on if you accomplished the - With the exception of the COMM check, are you up on the Flight Plan now?
We got the glycol check done and a suit integrity check done. We have not accomplished a regulator check or the rest of the COMM or the daylight star visibility.
Okay. We are scrubbing the daylight star visibility and the COMM check. How about your ascent batteries?
Roger. The ascent batteries checked out okay, and the pyros. You ready to copy?
Go ahead.
Roger. 36.8, 37.5 - A and B.
Roger. Copy. 36.8 and 37.5. Thank you.
Roger. [Pause]
And for your information, the ascent batteries were sharing just about equally.
Roger. Understand. [Pause]
And, Spider. We have got our data check. Let's go on with the secondary S-band check, step 2.
Roger. Power AMP going to SECONDARY.
Roger. [Pause]
Okay. And we are on secondary transmitter/receiver. How do you read?
Roger. I'm reading you loud and clear. Let me verify that it is S-band, Spider.
Okay. [Long pause]
You want me to lift that, Jim?
No. I can get it out, I think.
And, Spider, this is Houston. Let's go on to step 3.
Roger. [Long pause]
And Houston. We are back in primary primary, and be advised on the primary transmitter/receiver, I've got squeal.
Roger. Understand you're primary primary, and there is a squeal. You're coming through loud and clear here without any static at all. Let's stand by for data. I will give you call.
Roger.
And Spider. Also, we'd like to - at your convenience get an E memory dump in here. It's a little ahead of schedule, but we'd like to get it now if you can give us a VERB 74 sometime on your Mark.
Roger. Stand by. [Pause]
Okay. 3, 2, 1.
MARK. [Pause]
Roger. We got your - we got your Mark. We'll stand by and see if we got it. We might have you repeat it again shortly; and let me see if we are through with this check. [Long pause]
Spider, this is Houston. We have completed the secondary S-band check.
Roger. [Long pause]
And, Spider. If you have still got the squeal on primary, let's go secondary on your transmitter/receiver.
Roger. It has gone away now. We'll see how it works.
Okay. Thank you.
Phewee!
[Garble] work back there, isn't it?
Oh, boy. This thing doesn't fit, Rusty. This God-blessed netting is all screwed up. Oh, I almost broke by God-blessed finger off. Now I got it out; I'm never going to get it back in there.
[Garble] netting?
No, no, that's one - Oh, boy, the guy that sent that piece of machinery up ought to get his God-blessed head caved in. It simply no more fits than the man in the Moon. I can't even push that handle back and forth without the thing being in there. I get all fouled up in there. The trouble is, if I leave it like that and get a little vibration, that mother's going to shake loose.
Oh, hell's bells. All I got to do is touch it, and it comes right out. Will my feet bash anything they shouldn't?
No, you're sticking them in the guards; that's okay. I'll keep them away from the controllers.
Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston. We'll have you now for about another 12 minutes.
Gumdrop. Roger.
Spider. Roger
Oh, boy. Phew! Phew!
Don't overdo it.
Yes. Well, Rusty, I don't know what the heck else I can do with that thing.
Oh, boy.
[Garble] handle won't turn, huh?
No, I can't push it in.
Oh, my God, we got an OPS floating up here. I got to let go of something and grab it.
I'll ...
I got it.
I don't know where that strap is either. This is really neat.
[Garble] use a bunch of these.
I tried the other one here. And I had it strapped on one time; it just got out, that's all. It doesn't fit, you know, and ...
That's why I say use these, because you can adjust them a lot better.
Well, the other one was adjusted pretty well.
The strap's still there.
Ohhhh. Well, I'll just - I'll just put it through one of these other snaps on here.
Okay, there, that's strapped down.
Spider, Houston. We'd like to know when you are going to deploy the landing gear. We'd like to have a Mark on it and would like to get it before we lose you at Madrid in about 8 minutes, if possible.
Right away.
It will be pretty close to the end.
Okay.
Okay, let me get the camera.
Okay.
What do we need? We need the 5-millimeter lens, don't we?
No, 18 ...
No, the 18-millimeter lens, don't wet
I'm [garble] my gloves off, Jim.
Go ahead.
[Garble]. This is indoor, too. Shoot, we're - we're really well equipped.
Okay, Rusty, here's the camera. Let me get the film.
Okay. Stand by. I'll be right with you, Jim.
Okay.
Okay, I got it.
What are you looking for, Jim?
The film.
Didn't we transfer one?
No, we brought an indoor one over with us.
Okay, you got it?
Oh, shoot. How do we unseal this thing? Oh, there we go. Well, S comes before T, let's try that.
Hey -
Oh! Something else won't lock.
[Garble] you're really bashing things.
Yes, I know it. Especially my helmet. There it is.
You got it?
Yes.
Hello, world.
Hey, Gumdrop, this is Spider. We're going to deploy the landing gear in a few minutes here, so you'll probably feel big bang.
Sounds good.
Roger. [Pause]
Shoot.
Okay, where is that?
Ahhhh, come on.
You might stand back and give me a minute, will you? [Pause]
LANDING GEAR DEPLOY.
Gumdrop and Spider. Insure S-band volume up. We'll be going over to Madrid shortly.
Okay. How long do we have before you want the gear down?
We're ready any time.
How long do we have?
Okay. You've got about another 5 minutes before we'll lose you at Madrid.
Okay.
We'll be ready.
Unstow, adjust, and lock the sequence camera above the right window. 18-millimeter lens; CEX368 MAG; 24 frames per second; f:4 - 11 - f:11 at 1/250th; 20 feet. CB(11): ED LOGIC POWER A, OPEN. LOGIC POWER A, OPEN. R&D INSTRUMENTATION A, CLOSE. DFI POWER, ON.
Oh, hell, I can't tell my frame speed, hold on.
DFI POWER's coming ON, Rusty.
Okay.
Okay, the camera's ready.
Okay.
And, Spider. For your info we - DFI, we cannot read at Madrid, so we've only got about another minute here on Canaries to monitor that gear. [Pause]
Okay, you ready?
Yes. Okay, Dave, we are going to do it very quickly.
Okay, Dave. We'll do it very quickly.
Okay.
Okay. [Long pause]
DFI POWER, ON; MASTER ARM coming ON.
Did you get the LOGIC A, OPEN?
LOGIC A is OPEN.
Okay, MASTER ARM, ON; SEQUEICE CAMERA, CLOSED, I got that.
Okay.
Okay, you can give him a count, Jim, if you want. I've got the camera ready.
Okay - Put this around.
Okay. Houston, this is Spider. You ready? [Pause]
He has to - Why don't you watch it, too.
Yes, I'm going to. LANDING GEAR DEPLOY.
We're ready.
Houston, Spider. Do you read?
Spider, this is Houston. Read you loud and clear. We are ready. Go ahead and deploy the gear. [Pause]
Hey, he's talking, Jim.
3, 2, 1.
MARK. [Pause]
[Garble].
Okay, Houston. I've got a gray [garble] talkback, and I've got a gear out in front of me. I don't hear them. Hope they're on.
Spider, Gumdrop.
Dave, [garble] I've got [garble]. [Pause]
Sure do. Okay, the camera's OFF; LANDING GEAR DEPLOY, FIRE; SEQUENCE CAMERA, OFF; GET is 45:11:35.
GO.
Spider, Gumdrop. Okay. I think they copied you. They were listening when you said 3, 2, 1; then I got a break lock [garble].
Okay.
Gumdrop -
We've got one out here too, boy [garble].
That snapped right on down there.
Gumdrop and Spider, we copied you. We heard talk back gray, and you got a visual on the gear. [Long pause]
Okay. Okay, we've got to finish out that sequence.
Yes, Roger. I'm going. Okay, ED LOGIC B coming OPEN. OPEN.
Okay.
A, CLOSED.
A, CLOSED.
LANDING GEAR DEPLOY, FIRE.
Okay, Dave, I'm going to do it with the other pyro system now; you may hear a little bump. Okay, 3, 2, 1 -
FIRE.
Okay, ED LOGIC B, CLOSED.
Okay.
MASTER ARM, OFF.
By the way, can you see me out your overhead window? Go ahead, don't let me bother you. [Long pause]
Dave, I haven't had a chance to even look.
[Garble].
Okay, LOGIC B, CLOSED. I got MASTER ARM, OFF; LANDING GEAR FLAG, circuit breaker, Jim, OPEN. ED 11.
Okay.
R&D TELEMETRY CAL, ON. Why don't you try that real quick?
Yes. Okay.
Spider, this is Houston. Could you give us low bit rate?
Roger. Going low bit rate, and we are going to CAL right now.
Roger. Understand. We will see you over Carnarvon at 39.
Okay. Did you get that gear extension, Houston?
That's affirmative, Spider. It came through loud and clear. We are showing the relay closed, and I copied all your transmissions.
Thanks, Dave.
Roger. [Pause]
Okay, DFI - TELEMETRY CAL, OFF. That DFI POWER OFF now?
Gumdrop, this is Houston. Could you give us your up-telemetry switch, your command to RESET and back to NORMAL? [Long pause]
DFI, OFF; R&D A, OFF.
DFI POWER, OFF; and R&D INSTRUMENT A, OFF?
Right.
Okay.
[Garble] on S-band, Jim, and you didn't hear them answer you.
Yes.
Gumdrop, Houston. Could you give us RESET, back to NORMAL on your command reset? [Long pause]
Okay, PLSS prep.
Let me get the rest of this floor squared away.
[Garble] a view and a half out the window, isn't it?
Yes, you got a real - picture window there.
Watch your feet, Rusty.
And we will see you at Carnarvon at 39, Gumdrop and Spider.
Oh, I haven't found anything in this God-blessed thing that fits yet.
Okay, those aren't exactly flush, but they're down pretty well.
Just a second, Rusty, I'll be right with you. Shoot, come on water gun.
You alright, there? Okay. If you're in any - if you're in any trouble, wiggle your head, if you're not, just - okay? You want me to wipe your mouth off, if -
Yes.
- how about your nose here?
Okay.
Spider, I've been unable to reach you [garble].
Yes, that's okay, Dave. Okay?
Yes.
I'll get you my other chin strap here in a minute, this one of yours is kind of beat up. Here, I'll tell you what. If you - if you want to use this, I'll go down and get a - a clean towel, and I'll put some cold water on it for you, okay?
Okay. (clearing throat)
If I remember where the heck they were.
I sure feel a lot better afterwards.
Sorry.
That's okay, Rusty. Everybody has a problem. I think though, we're going to have to talk to Houston, and tell them what ours is. And ...
Yes. (clearing throat)
... I think we ought to - seriously consider - as a matter of fact, I'm going to recommend we scrub the EVA tomorrow.
Yes, I think that's a good idea.
I know how you want to do it, I think - maybe we'll - let you stay back in the command module with Dave, and I'll come over here, and we'll run through the check list, open up the cabin. Don't sweat it though.
Why don't you go ahead and take your gloves off? (clearing throat)
Here. How's that? Does that help, or is that just making you ...
No, that's okay. Don't shake me too much, though.
Okay.
Because I've got something in my hand here I don't want to let go of.
Yes. Let me - let me use this for just a minute.
Hey, Dave?
Go ahead.
What's the next time we get acquisition at the ground?
[Garble].
I don't know how we're going to clean this up now.
Well, we'll - figure something.
About 45 [garble] which is 20 minutes from now [garble].
Okay, I guess nobody's listening. Hey, Rusty got sick again, I think - I'm going to have to call Houston; we're going to have to have a little discussion about this. I think we're going to have to scrub the EVA for tomorrow for sure. But I think we probably ought to try to at least do the CABIN DEPRESS. We might want to do it at the end of today, and then just take tomorrow off.
Yes, that might not be a bad idea.
Too bad we don't have that ...
[Garble].
No, not at all. Thank you.
Okay.
I wonder if - Let's see, we have a tissue dispenser in here someplace.
Dave, as soon as we get contact with Houston, tell them I want to go PRIVATE with them.
[Garble].
No, I'm going to be - I'll probably not be talking much here for a couple of minutes.
Okay, I'll let Houston know [garble] get squared away.
How's your stomach feeling? Is it feeling any better?
No, it feels fine now.
You want me to undo your chin strap for you there?
Yes.
I'll just - I'm sorry, I'm going to have to gouge you a little bit there.
Well, do you want to let it float or do you want to ...
I'd get that Kleenex for you, if I knew where it was. It's over on your side, someplace up there.
(clearing his throat). Now we got to stow this stuff somewhere.
Yes, I know it. I'll be with you in just a minute, Rusty.
That's really funny, Jim. Because both cases there, it's not because I'm moving; I can feel it way down in my stomach.
Uh huh.
It feels like there is something that I ate ...
Well ...
... or something I took.
Yes.
One or the other.
[Garble] my stomach's been gurgling an awful lot, too. I think it's from that water.
Well, I'm worried about that - I'm still wondering about that bacon. It might be the water, too. I don't know.
Let's see, we got to do something with that. Tell you what.
With what?
With that - stuff you have in your hands there.
Hey, great.
Oh, shoot. It's not very big, Rusty.
What is it?
It's the bag that the water gun was in.
That's a pretty clean one. I'll just stow this.
(clearing throat)
Thank you.
I don't know where your clip went.
That's okay. It's around somewhere. Why don't you just get comfortable, there, and don't do anything.
Hell, I'm feeling good, Jim.
Okay. Well, why don't you just rest for awhile, and not - not bother doing anything. I think we'll scrub most of these COMM checks here - a few of them until we get organized here.
Hey, no, no I'm - I'm serious ...
Well, we're going to have to get the PLSS out.
Right, let's go ahead and do that. Let me get - Let me clean off my chin strap here.
Yes, I've got another one with me, I think.
Oh, that might be good. This one's kind of wet and soggy.
Yes, let me get it [garble].
There it is, back there. And there's the other one. Excuse me.
Am I fairly well cleaned up?
Yes, you look pretty good.
(Clearing throat)
Alrighty. Let me finish what I was doing, and get these helmet bags out of here.
Okay, I'm going to look ahead, here. Alright, the next thing is the PLSS COMM check with the LM mean - yes.
Hello, Gumdrop and Spider. This is Houston trough Carnarvon.
Roger. Go.
[Garble] I would like to go private with you.
You cut each other out there. Say again, please. [Pause]
I'll get it, Dave. Houston, this is Spider, I would like to go private with you, please.
Roger. Understand. Will do. [Long pause]
Okay, Spider. It will be a couple of minutes here.
Okay.
Spider, this is Houston. Do you read?
Roger. I read you.
Okay. We're all configured for a private talk, Jim.
Hello, Houston. This is [garble]. [Pause]
Hello, Spider. Did you call? This is Houston. [Long pause]
Gumdrop, this is Houston. How do you read through Honeysuckle?
Roger, Houston. You're five-by.
Roger. I believe Spider called. We may be having S-band troubles with him again. Can you read me, Spider? [Pause]
Spider, Gumdrop. Could you try and call Houston? They're reading you.
No, I'm not reading Houston at all. Roger. I just wanted to tell them that we're going to try to complete that TV pass over Houston with the PLSS. And at that time, we're going to try taking the PLSS apart, and that will be the end of the COMM check.
Spider, this is Houston. I copy that, and what I'm recommending is that we configure for that mode 10 over Mercury. We will have about an 11-minute pass, over Mercury, and we will get all set up then, and then we will be ready to go when we come into the States. [Pause]
Okay. Spider, Gumdrop. What he wants you do is - He understood what you said. He would like for you to configure for the mode 10 over Mercury so you can get all set up to get about an 11-minute pass here.
Gumdrop, this is Houston. If they will not be ready for that, it's no problem. We've still got you here at Honeysuckle for about 5 minutes. We will have you at Mercury for 11.
Okay. He got it, Houston. He said Roger, and I assume they'll be able to do that for you.
Okay. Very good.
Hello, Spider. This is Houston. Could you give a high bit rate, please! [Pause]
Spider, Houston wants high bit rate. [Long pause]
Gumdrop, Houston. Did he copy you?
Roger. He said he'd get it in just a minute.
Okay. Evidently, I'm not getting anything out of him. I'll check the site.
Okay.
This is Spider. [Pause]
Houston, Gumdrop. Spider says he's reading you five-by now.
Roger. Understand. Spider, can you give me a transmission? Hoy do you read me?
I'm reading you loud and clear. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Okay. I'm reading you real good. We've got 8 minutes in this pass, and if you'd like to get set up for the LM two-way relay and adjust your VOX and so forth, I can give you a count any time you want it and get yours. Let me know when you are going to that configuration. [Pause]
Roger, Houston. We'll be with you in a minute. Stand by.
Roger. Standing by. [Long pause]
And, Houston, we're going FM now.
Roger. Go on FM. [Long pause]
And, Gumdrop and Spider, be advised I'm going to go to our test configuration, which will be LM S-band only back to Houston. And, Mercury M and O, this is Houston CAP COMM. Would you inhibit my VHF uplink and remote LM 8-band only. [Pause]
And, Spider, this is Houston. If you read, could you give me antenna number 2, S-band antenna number 2? [Pause]
Roger. You've got 2. Do you want 1?
Negative. Leave it in 2 right now, and I'm reading you okay.
Okay. Roger. That's what you had all along.
Okay. [Long pause]
Why don't you go ahead and do it? [Pause]
[Garble].
Take if off; what the hell. [Pause]
How'd you hear me?
Okay, Spider. I got just the last part of that. How about a short count?
Were we active there?
Okay, Spider. It's breaking ...-
It's in one? [Pause]
[Garble] COMM SC audio close.
Roger. Just a minute. [Pause]
Unstowed. [Pause]
Audio for the LMP side. S-band and TI. ICS OFF. Relay ON. [Garble] outside RCS transmitter. [Pause]
RCS transmitter.
Just VOX to about 8.
VOX to about 8.
HF 8 a TR.
A to TR.
B OFF.
B OFF.
HF 8 scratched. Adjusted at CDR to hear CSM.
Gumdrop, Spider here. Give me a short count.
Roger, Gumdrop. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Gumdrop out.
Roger. Fine. That was good. Thank you.
Say it again; you're broken to me.
Roger. I'm on VOX now. I said that was good. And, Gumdrop, we're configuring for the TV mode, which is mode 10. [Pause]
I'm not hearing you at all, Jim.
Gumdrop, this is Spider. Do you read re?
Do you have your audio on? [Pause]
Gumdrop, did you hear Spider? He's calling.
Gumdrop, Spider. Do you read? [Pause]
Spider, this is Houston. How do you read? [Pause]
Roger, Gumdrop. This is Spider. How do you read?
Okay [garble].
Roger. We're configuring mode 10 COMM, which is the TV EMU relay.
Roger. [Garble].
Okay. Very good. [Long pause]
Okay, Spider and Gumdrop. It's about a minute - and a half to LOS here at Mercury. Your acquisition time at Texas is 25. [Pause]
There's our trouble.
Spider, this is Houston. Do you read? If you do, we are going to lose you in about a minute. Your acquisition time at Texas is 25. [Pause]
[Garble] 25.
Okay. It will be 25, and then we'll have about 2 minutes at the MIN before the TV pass starts. [Pause]
Roger.
And, Spider, could you give us low bit rate? [Long pause]
And, Spider, this is Houston. We'd like - We'd like to have low bit rate and data on VHF B until we get you.
Apollo 9, Houston. Excuse me - Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston. How do you read through Texas? [Long pause]
Spider, this is Houston through Texas. How do you read? [Long pause]
Okay, Spider. This is Houston. Do I have you? [Long pause]
Spider, this Houston. Do you read? [Long pause]
We should have had acquisition by now, shouldn't we?
Hello, Spider. This is Houston. Do you read me? [Pause]
Spider, this is Houston. If you read, you can go ahead and put in your TV circuit breaker. We are going to be handing over to Mila in about 20 seconds. [Long pause]
And, Spider, if you read, we'd like high bit rate. [Long pause]
Hello, Spider. This is Houghton. How do you read?
Roger, Houston. This is Spider. Loud and clear.
Roger. You are loud and clear here. Now we have you in Mila AOS. You can start your TV pass. [Long pause]
Beautiful, Spider. We've got a picture now.
And, Spider, this is Houston. If you read me, could you give us high bit rate? [Long pause]
And you - And the picture is coming through good, Spider. We are copying it. We've got a good view of Rusty and the PLSS. [Long pause]
Okay. Rusty, if you read me, how about raising your left arm there? Very good. We can see you; coming in real good. [Long pause]
Well, we just went through a little snow storm there, Spider, but it looks like it might come back in. [Pause]
Okay, the blizzard is gone, and you are back real sharp now. We've got good detail. [Pause]
And, Spider, like I say, we are getting a good picture; we're getting no voice at all. [Pause]
And I can see you talking there, Jim. Too bad I can't read your lips. [Long pause]
Okay. Why don't you just go VHF if you can, Spider?
Roger. How do you read me right now?
We're reading you loud and clear, Spider.
Okay. I guess we're just not getting out, like a VOX or something. Gumdrop is reading me all right, but you aren't.
Okay. I'm not reading Gumdrop at all, and I am reading you loud and clear now. And the TV picture has been real good.
Okay. We are going to have the LMP talking into the PLSS comm.
Okay. How do you read now, Houston?
PLSS? You are coming through loud and clear, Rusty. It's real good.
Okay. We have to go to PTC on the hand controller to do it. Evidently, ICS won't do it.
Roger. Copy. It's coming through real good now. We've got just a little under 3 minutes in the pass. [Long pause]
And, Rusty, if you ... [Pause]
Houston, this is Spider. Say again.
Roger. If it's real convenient, we would like to have position 5 on the PLSS. But don't sweat it if you can't give us that. [Pause]
[Garble]. [Pause]
Okay. We had a loud squeal in there. I've got you back again now. The request was - If it's real convenient, we would like to have position 5 on the PLSS. [Long pause]
Okay. Jim, could we have a couple of words on - of wisdom to go along with the TV show? [Long pause]
Okay. We are not receiving you. Rusty, how about you trying it again? May be we can pick you up. [Long pause]
Okay, Spider. This is Houston. That's the end of the Milla pass. If you read me, you can go back to COMM basic at your convenience and press ahead with the Flight Plan. [Pause]
We're reconfiguring the PLSS right now and its COMM, and we're going to end the COMM checks here. And we will get them some other time.
Roger. Understand. And that transmission came through loud and clear, and we will be standing by. [Long pause]
Houston, Spider.
Go ahead, Spider. Houston reading you loud and and clear.
Roger, Houston. We're reconfiguring to basic COMM, and we're going to mush on and prepare for all the systems here.
Roger. We will be standing by.
Roger. [Long pause]
And, Gumdrop, did you read that?
Negative. I'm not copying Houston at all.
Roger. We're configuring, and we are going to press on with the systems.
Okay. Understand.
And, Gumdrop, this is Houston. I've got you now.
Roger. Houston, Gumdrop. You are five-by.
Very good.
Gumdrop, Houston.
Houston, Gumdrop.
Roger. We would like to terminate the charge on battery A.
Roger. Understand. Battery A, terminate charge. [Long pause]
And, Gumdrop, Houston. We put in 13 AMP-hours. You are right back up to 40.
Roger. Thank you. Very nice.
Okay. Gumdrop and Spider. We're going to lose you in about a minute and a half here, and we'll see you over Carnarvon at 16. [Long pause]
Spider, this is Houston. If you read, give us low bit rate.
Roger. Low bit rate.
Okay. We'll see you at 16 over Carnarvon.
Roger.
Ready. [Pause]
64 00308. [Pause]
All right. That was a little fast, but 35128 06864 00308.
Roger. You got it.
Thank you.
Dave, are your rates slow?
Holy Christmas! What a bunch of gyros I've got over here! [Pause]
And, Spider, this is Houston. We'd like to have high bit rate.
Houston, this is Spider. Go again.
Roger. We'd like to have high bit rate.
High bit rate. Roger. [Pause]
Gumdrop, Spider. Every one of my gyros is indicating about 3/10 of a degree per second.
Is that right? My roll is 0, pitch 0, yaw 0.
Great!
And Gumdrop, I haven't heard from you on this one. And, Spider, I've got a couple of items to pass to you when you have a chance. [Pause]
Spider here. Go ahead.
Roger. I've got a couple of addresses that's get to be changed as a result of the 3-day slip in the launch date, and when you are ready to copy, I'll give them to you. [Pause]
Okay. Before you give us those, be advised that we have got a cockpit error here and we loaded - in starting up the PGNCS, we loaded location 30 000 with 2176 and we would like to know what we should put back into 30 000. [Pause]
Roger. Stand by. In work.
If you want a reference on that, it's system 36, step 1.
Roger. Copy.
And the Gumdrop's with you, Houston.
Roger, Gumdrop. [Long pause]
And, Gumdrop, this is Houston. At your convenience, you might drag, out your block data pad. I have block data 6 to give you as we get along here. I have the PAD now.
[Garble].
And, Gumdrop, this is Spider. So you can get out of your narrow deadband hold there, we will take an 0620 on your Mark.
Roger. Roger. Okay. Stand by.
Roger. Roger. Spider, Gumdrop. 3, 2, 1.
Roger. MARK.
Okay. Ready to copy your angles, and you can go to DRIFT.
Roger. Thank you. 35168 06888 00282. [Pause]
Roger. Houston and Gumdrop, readback here from the Spider: 35168 0688 00282. [Pause]
Roger, Spider. I have that. I'm reading back Gumdrop's as plus 35168 06888 00282; I'm reading yours as 31148 24879 35590. [Pause]
That's a verify, and the docking ring angle was plus 2.10 degrees.
Roger. Plus 2.1.
Roger. And Spider ready to copy your updates.
Okay. These addresses, if you are - if this unit W were the North Pole's - and your first address is 1714. What we want to load in there is 11143. The next address is 1716. We would like to load 30341. Now there were a couple of updates needed in the TFM, but you will pick those up as you go through that step. These are the only two that we would like to have you load.
Roger. Be advised we already loaded TFM. Do you want us to read that down to you?
Yes. Let's have it to verify.
Okay. Ready to copy?
Go ahead.
Okay. Four balls 7 35016 31153.
Roger. That's verified.
Okay. And we will be using these right now.
Okay. Very good. [Long pause]
Houston, Gumdrop. I'm all ready for the block update.
Roger. Stand by just one if you can, Gumdrop,
All righty. [Pause]
Spider, Houston.
Go.
Roger. We would like to know if you got an operator error when you hit ENTER on that 30 000 address.
That's a negative.
Roger. Copy. No operator error.
Not that I noticed, anyway.
Okay.
Let me put it this way. If there was an operator error, it disappeared by itself when I loaded the date, because I did not key a RESET.
Roger. Copy. [Long pause]
Gumdrop, Spider. We would like to insure that the rates are less than 1/10 of a degree per second, and you won't be firing any jets for the next minute or so.
Okay. You are all set.
Roger. Thank you. [Long pause]
Okay. Gumdrop, this is Houston. I would like to get started on this block data.
Roger. Go.
Roger. 033 1 Alfa, plus 297, minus 0621 051 04 32 3870, and I would like to have both vehicles insure S-band volume up. 034 4 Alfa, plus 325, minus 1579 053 58 09 3858; 035 4 Alfa, plus 337, minus 1579 055 29 08 3857; 036 3 Alfa, plus 292, plus 1450 056 53 16 4635. Like to verify you are with me, Gumdrop. We didn't lose you over in the handover? [Pause]
I'm with you. I dropped about four bits, there, but go ahead.
Okay. 037 4 Alfa, plus 244, plus 1619 058 39 31 4574; 038 3 Baker, plus 320, plus 1500 060 02 28 4618, and for your SPS trim angles, through your first three - through 35 dash 4 Alfa: your pitch is minus 0.88, yaw is minus 0.60. Through the rest of them: your pitch is minus 0.93, yaw is minus 1.21. End of update.
Roger. Okay. I dropped one bit on the seconds on 34 4 Alfa. And the next area, I dropped the first three lines, and the rest of it I've got. So how about giving me those that I dropped?
Okay. The second line in 34 4 Alfa is plus 325, the first three lines in the next one, 035 4 Alfa, plus 337, minus 1579; and I'd like for you to hold the readback for a little bit. And Spider, I have your LM torquing angles. [Pause]
Roger. Stand by just one.
Roger.
Roger. This is Gumdrop. Give me the seconds on the time of 34 4 Alfa.
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you said the second line. Okay. The second: 09; the time: 053:58:09. [Pause]
Roger. 09. And I'll read it back whenever you're ready.
Okay.
Houston. This is Spider. Reader to copy the angles.
Okay. Reading the torquing angles: plus 00 910, minus 00 150, plus 01 210. [Pause]
Roger. Reading back: plus 00 910, minus 00 150, plus 01 210.
That's affirmative. We've got you.
Thank you. [Pause]
Spider, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. And on this 30 000 bit, evidently the computer dropped a 3 and loaded addresses all zeros, and there is no action required on your part.
That's fortunate. Thank you.
Roger. [Long pause]
Spider and Gumdrop, on the last two dumps of the DSE we have received no LM data. Would like to have you check your cockpit configurations to receive the LM data, and also for Spider to send it.
Roger. Gumdrop's configured. [Long pause]
Gumdrop, Spider. What was that last call? We've got a lot of noise on the S-band.
Roger. On the last two passes on the DSE they have not received any LM data on the dump. [Pause]
Roger. We're configured for data here.
Okay. [Garble]. [Long pause]
Houston, Gumdrop. [Pause]
Go, Gumdrop.
Roger I don't see the tape recorder running at at this time.
Stand by, Gumdrop.
Gumdrop, this is Houston. Could you verify your tape recorder switch is in the RECORD position?
That's verified.
Okay. Thank you. [Long pause]
Houston, this is Spider.
Go, Spider.
Spider, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Gumdrop, is he reading us?
Roger. He's reading you. Go ahead.
Okay. I'll have to transmit in the blind. Be advised we're beginning the RCS pressurization on system 42, and on the second step we have an interesting result there. When I recycled system A, ascent feed 2 to CLOSE, both barber poles jumped to J, ascent feed 1 went back to barber pole immediately, and ascent feed 2 waited for about 20 seconds and then went back to barber pole; and that's happened twice in a row.
Roger. Copy. Stand by on that one.
He got you, Spider.
Okay. If you have any recommendation - I'm going to try in system B. If he has any recommendations let me know.
Okay.
All right. We sure will; we're massaging that now, Spider.
Spider, Gumdrop. They are working it over. [Long pause]
Spider, Houston. [Pause]
Houston, Gumdrop. I don't believe he's reading. I can relay for you.
Okay. We're about to lose you here at Honeysuckle, we'll see you over Mercury about 37, in about 3 minutes, and we'll clean it up there.
Very well; Mercury at 37.
Gumdrop, if you still read me, why don't you start the readback of that block data here until we go over the hill.
Roger. Let's give it a go.
033 1 Alfa - Oh, I'm losing you now, Houston. [Long pause]
Okay. Roger. And you might advise him that system A [garble] appear to be normal now. It looks like we might have had a sticky barber pole on ascent feed 2.
We copied that, Spider. We concur.
Okay.
Okay, Spider and Gumdrop. We should have you through Mercury.
Roger, Houston. Here's the Gumdrop.
You have Spider here, Houston.
Roger. We're showing your RCS pressurized, and we're also requesting you check the address 1457 and verify that it is 62045, and the reason why I'm calling you on this is, back on systems 41 when you loaded 1456, we believe it also change 1457. [Pause]
Okay. Lets - The address is 1457. What is the number supposed to be now?
Should be 62045.
Roger. 1457 should be 62045.
That's affirmative.
Roger. Houston, You might check 1453 and 1455, also. My understanding was that those are double precisions for the PIPA bias, and that's why we loaded zeros in all three of these.
Roger. Copy, Spider, in work.
Okay. [Long pause]
Houston, this is Spider.
Go, Spider.
1457 is all balls.
Okay. We'd like to have you load 62045.
Okay. Then probably 3 and 5 will also be wrong. I'll load this one up right now.
Okay. We'll get back with you on that. We're going to have you over the Mercury here for about 7-1/2 minutes left, and I'd like to pass you your gimbal angles so we'll be all rocking on ready for your gimbal drive check when we hit Guaymas.
Roger. Stand by just one. [Pause]
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. Your GDA angles: R1, plus 00588; and R2, plus 00679. [Pause]
Roger. Plus 00588, plus 00679.
That's affirmative; and stand by. I'll have you what you need in address 1453 and 55.
Roger. Do you have LM and CSM weights, by the way?
Stand by one, Spider. [Long pause]
Spider, Houston.
Roger. Go.
All right. Your LM weight: 32 418, and that's also for Gumdrop if he wants it. CSM 30 127.
Roger. 32 418 and 30 127.
That's affirmative, Spider.
Roger. How much time do we have in this pass?
Roger, Spider. We've still got about 5 minutes left in this pass.
Okay. I'd like - Some of the systems guys might have noticed a little anomaly there at the end of the RCS pressurization on step 6.
Okay.
Make it step 5. I beg your pardon. I inadvertently placed system A ascent feed 2 momentarily to OPEN instead of CLOSE, thereby opening the interconnect. I closed it immediately, and I see no change in the system pressures; however it's probably an anomaly and in the data there you might note, and I'd like to know if there is any further action required.
Roger, Spider. Houston copies. And we anticipate no problems. And I have your loads for 1453 and 55. [Pause]
Roger. Ready to copy.
1453: 60066. 1455: 60462. [Pause]
Roger. Let me read all of those. 53, 55 and 57 equal 60066, 60462, 62045. [Pause]
That is affirmative, Spider; Houston confirms.
Roger. We'll load them now.
Okay. And, Gumdrop, let's go ahead with your readback, starting right from the first line. [Long pause]
Gumdrop, Houston. Standing by for your readback. [Pause]
Houston, Gumdrop.
Roger. I'm ready for your readback.
Okay. Sorry, I must have lost you there for a minute. Okay, here we go: 033 1 Alfa, plus 297, minus 0621 051 04 32 3870; 034 4 Alfa, plus 325, minus 1579 053 58 09 3858; 035 4 Alfa plus 337, minus 1579 055 29 08 3857; 036 3 Alfa, plus 292, plus 1450 056 53 16 4638; 037 4 Alfa, plus 244, minus 1619 058 39 31 4574; 038 3 Bravo, plus 320, plus 1500 060 02 28 4618. You with me that far? [Pause]
I've got it all, and everything's good.
Okay. And the pitch trim and yaw trim for 33 1 Alfa through 35 4 Alfa: pitch is minus 0.88, yaw minus 0.60. For 36 3 Alfa through 38 3 Bravo: pitch minus 0.93, yaw minus 1.21.
Roger. Good show, Gumdrop. And we're gonna lose both of you in about 1 minute. We'll see you over Guaymas at about 57, and we'll be rocking on ready for you, Spider.
Roger. What time will we be at Guaymas?
Roger. it'll be Guaymas at 57, and we'd like to have low bit rate at this time.
Roger.
Hello, Spider and Gumdrop. This is Houston through the Redstone.
Loud and clear, Houston. Gumdrop.
Roger. And to get a leg up on this Guaymas pass, I have a NAV check I'd like to give to you now, and we'll be uplinking state vectors to both vehicles over Guaymas, sometime in the States pass. [Long pause]
Okay, Spider. Are you ready, Gumdrop? I'll be ready to send you a NAV check when you're ready to copy. [Pause]
Ready for NAV check. [Long pause]
Gumdrop's ready.
Roger, Gumdrop. I'll give it to you. Are you ready, Spider?
Roger. Spider ready.
All right. Reading the NAV check: 049 11 3340, minus 2216, plus 16516 23039. End of NAV check. [Pause]
Roger. Say the time again, please.
Roger. Reading the time: 049 11 3340. [Pause]
Say, Gumdrop. I got 3340, is that right, Gumdrop?
That's affirmative, Spider; this is Houston.
Okay. I'll read it back to you: 049 11 3340, minus 2216, plus 16516 2309. [Pause]
Your readback is correct, Spider; and Gumdrop, did you verify? [Pause]
Gumdrop verifies.
Roger. And while I've got you in a writing mood - I've got about a minute and a half; I'd like to give you the dock DPS PAD.
Roger. You should be advised that you are not coming through too good here to Spider; I'm not sure why, but you are breaking up pretty badly.
Roger. We're going to lose you in about a minute, and then we'll just catch you over Guaymas.
Roger. Gumdrop copied you. You'll get us over Guaymas. You get that, Spider?
Roger. I heard you. Understand he's going to get us over Guaymas.
That's affirm. [Long pause]
And, Gumdrop and Spider, if you read, we are GO for a 48 dash 1.
Roger. Understand. GO for a 48 dash 1. [Pause]
That is affirmative. [Pause]
Did you get that, Spider?
Got it.
Okay.
We'll stay docked with you.
Oh, very well. [Pause]
And, Gumdrop, we've got you now at Guaymas. We'd like to have P00 in ACCEPT for your uplink.
Roger. Gumdrop. You've got P00 and ACCEPT.
Roger, Copy. [Long pause]
And, Gumdrop, you'll be receiving a vector in both slots.
Roger. Understand. [Long pause]
Spider, could you give us high bit rate, please?
Roger. You got high bit rate?
Roger. Copy. [Long pause]
And, Houston, this is Spider.
Go ahead, Spider.
Roger. We are ready to go on the gimbal drive any time.
Roger. We are standing by to support you. You can let her rip.
Roger. Here we go - 3, 2, 1.
MARK. [Pause]
And are you ready?
You faded out, Spider. Say again.
Roger. The gimbal is driving.
Houston, Gumdrop. Spider says the gimbal is driving.
Roger. Copy. And, Gumdrop, the computer is yours.
Roger. Understand you copy, and I got the computer.
Houston, do you read Gumdrop or Spider?
Reading you loud and clear, Spider.
Here we have the GGA PCGA light on at this time, and are you ready to support the throttle test?
Spider, you are GO for the throttle test. [Pause]
Roger. LMP throttle is idle. We are now at the soft-stop.
Roger. Copy.
Okay. Full throttle point and back to IDLE. [Pause]
Okay, Houston. Commander's throttle is in IDLE. Now soft-stop - maximum - back down to the soft- stop and IDLE. [Pause]
Roger, Spider. [Long pause]
Okay. Houston, this is Spider. We are standing by for your verification on the GDA angle.
Roger. I believe they look good. Stand by one, Spider. [Pause]
Spider, this is Houston. You are GO on the gimbal drive angles.
Roger. Stand by for hot fire.
Roger. We are standing by.
We are standing by to support your hot fire, Spider. We are ready.
Houston, we are ready to go.
Let her rip, Spider.
Okay. A couple more switches. [Long pause]
Okay, Houston. Spider here. We will start the proportionalized check, both fire.
Roger. Understand. And we are ready to go.
Roger. [Long pause]
Okay. That's complete.
Roger. [Pause]
Gumdrop, We are about to fire our jets here so you want to be in FREE.
Roger. FREE standing by.
Roger.
How are you with respect to gimbal lock?
Oh, about 15 - 20 degrees.
Okay. Keep an eyeball on it.
Okay. I will be right with you. [Pause]
You told us to take the hot fare now.
We're ready to go. PRESS.
Roger. [Long pause]
Okay, Houston. It's complete.
Roger. Copy.
Good job; rate is almost normal.
I still have some more to go. [Long pause]
Okay, Houston. Here comes a little hot fire on a TTCA.
Roger. Spider, this is Houston. Would you go through it slower, please? You are going to have to go slower.
Okay. We'll go TTCA.
Roger.
We are not going to hold them [garble] long. We'll just wait longer between pulses.
Roger. That will really help us out, Spider.
You don't want them held down longer. You just want them longer between pulses. Is that right?
That is affirmative, Spider.
Okay. We'll try it again.
That was up.
Down. [Pause]
Right. [Pause]
Left. [Pause]
Aft.
How was that, Houston?
That looked real good Spider. [Pause]
Okay. Here comes the PNGS OTGA check.
Roger, Spider. [Pause]
Up. [Pause]
Down. [Pause]
Right. [Pause]
Left. [Pause]
Forward. [Pause]
Aft.
How was that?
That looked real good, Spider. Everything looks good.
Okay, Dave. That's all of the hot fire.
Okay. Good job. You moved us away from it. [Pause]
And, Houston, you got to give us the update at this time?
Roger. I have the PAD ready to go, and can you take an uplink now?
Roger. The computer is yours; and ready to copy the docked DPS. This is Spider.
Roger, Spider. Stand by one.
Gumdrop is ready.
Okay. Copied you, Gumdrop. And Spider, the uplink is on its way. I'm reading docked DPS: 049 41 3340, minus 00603, minus 17430, minus 00007 17440 all zips all zips, minus 00587, minus 17430, minus 00139. End of update. [Pause]
Roger, Houston. Spider reading back: 049 41 3340, minus 00603, minus 17430, minus 00007 17440 all zips all zips, minus 00587, minus 17430, minus 00139. [Pause]
Roger. Very good. The readback was correct.
Gumdrop copied. [Long pause]
And, Spider and Gumdrop, it looks like we are making good work on this pass. We've still got about 15 minutes here. [Pause]
Houston, Spider here. You broke up.
Houston, this is Spider.
Go, Spider.
Roger. We are going to start the landing radar self-test here if you are ready. [Pause]
Spider, this is Houston. The computer is yours. We are standing by for the landing radar selftest. Press ahead.
Okay. The DFI is coming on now.
Roger.
Gumdrop, Houston.
Houston, Gumdrop.
Roger. We would like to have you bring quad C back on the line when you disable Baker 3.
Wilco. [Pause]
Gumdrop and Houston, be advised that Spider did not unstow the radar antenna today. [Pause]
Roger. We understood that. Will you be unstowing it for the rendezvous radar self-test? [Pause]
I don't believe so. I think we can run the selftest without unstowing it. Since we're not going to do the EVA tomorrow, there is no sense in unstowing it. We've already skipped the star check in the daylight, so we have, no reason to get it out of the way.
Roger. Copy.
If you have any other comment, please let us know.
All right. Sure will.
And Gumdrop copied.
And, Houston, here comes the landing radar spurious noise test.
Roger. Copy, Spider. [Long pause]
Houston, do you read? Spider.
Go, Spider.
Roger. How long do you want us to run this spurious noise test here?
Stand by one.
Roger. Step 16, system 49. We are ready to stop it any time you are ready.
Roger. Understand. We are taking a look at it, Spider. And, Spider, you can terminate the test now. And, Gumdrop, we would like to have quad C on whether you disable Backer 3 or not.
Roger. Charlie coming up. [Long pause]
And, Gumdrop, we are showing your quad balance as excellent. It's looking real great, Gumdrop.
Houston, Spider.
Go ahead, Spider. This is Houston.
Your R and D telemetry CALIBRATE coming on now.
Roger. Copy. [Long pause]
And, Gumdrop and Spider, this is Houston. We have finished up that famous pass with 6 minutes to spare. [Pause]
Smokey, you are so smooth I just can't believe it. You are just directing us magnificently.
I'm getting mad with power down here, Spider. [Long pause]
Say, Gumdrop, this is Spider.
Go ahead.
You are still going to have to disable B3 for a while so we don't get any corona on our radar.
Okay. Say when.
How about right now.
Okay. It's disabled. [Pause]
Gumdrop, Houston.
Houston, Gumdrop. Go ahead.
Roger. We're still recommending two-jet roll authority - we're recommending Able Charlie roll off.
Houston, Gumdrop. Say again.
Roger. We are recommending that two-jet roll authority, roll AC - we'd like to leave it off.
Houston, Gumdrop. You get knocked down with static every time. Try it again.
Okay. We would like to stay with two-jet roll authority - recommend in AC stay off.
Okay. Very well. AC coning back off.
Say, Spider and Gumdrop. We are going to lose you here in about 1 minute. We'll see you over Tananarive at 37, and that was a good show on both vehicles there.
Okey-dokey.
Roger. Gumdrop. [Long pause]
Houston, this is Gumdrop - Spider. Before you go - if you are still reading us - We are not reading any range and range rate on the DSKY for the radar.
Roger. Understand. No range and range rates. And, Spider, we'd like to have low bit rate, please. [Pause]
Roger.
And we are looking at that problem on your range and range rate right now, Jim. We think the stowing of the radar might of affect that.
Okay.
Okay. We get the range rate to read this time [garble] back again. It's really 497. [Pause]
Roger. I believe I got that, 497.
Roger.
Spider and Gumdrop, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston through Tananarive. Standing by. [Long pause]
Tanarive M&O, this is Houston CAPCOMM. Do you read? [Pause]
Tanarive M&O, Houston CAPCOMM. Voice check.
CAPCOMM, Tananarive.
Tananarive M&O, this is Houston CAPCOMM. Am I coming through to you? Am I going up? Communications Technician:
The first transmission was very low down in the mud. You called back, asked for the M&O; I received it clear, and then we were switched over to Melbourne circuit. Communications Technician:
Okay. Am I going up to the spacecraft at this time? Communications Technician:
[Garble].
All right. This is Houston CAP [garble].
Affirmative.
All right, Spider and Gumdrop. This is Houston through Tananarive. [Pause]
Tananarive M&O, Houston, CAPCOMM. Am I receiving a downlink from the spacecraft? Communications Technician:
[Garble] I'll copy.
Okay, Spider and Gumdrop. Houston in the blind. If you read me, we will see you over Carnarvon at 53.
Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston through Carnarvon. And, Spider, we would like to have high bit rate. [Pause]
Got you, Houston. Going to high bit rate.
Gumdrop is with you.
Roger. And just maybe till we shoot our COMM, did either of you read me over Tananarive.
Spider. I read you.
And Gumdrop did too.
Very good. Thank you.
Say, Houston, Spider. I've got your stuff for you.
Go ahead, I'm ready to copy.
Okay. Number 1, our helium SUPERCRIT pressure is reading again at 750. [Pause]
Roger. Copy, Spider. We're showing 735.
That's okay. My helium ambient pressure is down to 210. I think that's a little lower than it's supposed to be.
Roger. We confirm that. We're shoving 208, and it's okay.
Okay. Be advised we can not initialize the AGS from the PGNCS. We can not initialize the AGS from the PGNCS.
Roger. Copy. You can not initialize AGS from the PGNCS.
Update part of it from the PGNCS to the AGS. The downlink part of PGNCS will not get into the AGS. When we put 10 000 up, it just stays there at 10 000.
Roger. Understand that the AGS will not accept the PGNCS downlink.
Roger.
Oh, and did you get our message on the rendezvous radar?
Roger. I und - you were going - you were - just about to lose you - You said you had no range rate on the DSKY, and then you did something, and I didn't copy that.
Okay, we got the range to come in to the DSKY one time and the range rate a couple of times, but it's not consistent at all.
Roger. Copy. [Long pause]
Say, Houston, did you get our gimbal angles and that other stuff?
That is a negative. We have not received anything from you over Tananarive.
Okay, Gumdrop. You want to send then down those?
I'll get them.
Okay. Never mind. I guess we have them all. Gumdrop, why don't you send them the torquing angles first?
Okay. Houston, Gumdrop. Are you ready to copy?
Go ahead.
Okay. The P52 torquing angles: GET 48:44:00, plus 00213, plus 00042, minus 00147.
Roger. Copy those, Gumdrop.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. And I've got IMU realignment angles for you.
I'm standing by to copy.
Roger. Command module angles: 02029 02856 33357. LM angles: 28202 20876 02659.
Roger, Spider. I copy. For command module: 02029 02856 33357. For the LM: 28202 20876 02659. And we'll go to work on them.
Roger. And when you're ready, I've got some AGS calibration data.
Roger. I'm ready to copy.
I'm ready to copy your data, Spider. [Pause]
Roger. Stand by. [Pause]
Okay. The bias coefficients before the CAL: minus 77777, plus all zips, minus all 7's. The gyro drift: we're plus 00027, plus 00047, plus 00006. Did you copy those?
Roger. I copied those.
Okay. And following the CAL: plus all zips plus all zips, minus all 7's. And the gyro drift after the CAL: plus 00021, plus: 00036, minus 00020.
Roger, Spider. I copy those. [Pause]
Okay . And the only other thing I need right now is the procedure from one of the AGS guys on how to get 414 back to zero. As I recall, you can not simply set it to zero; you have to go through a little procedure, there. I wonder if you would get that for us.
Roger, Spider. I copy. 414 back to zero, and that's in work. [Long pause]
And, Gumdrop and Spider, I'd like to have both vehicles with S-band up. We'll be going over to Honeysuckle in a couple of minutes.
Gumdrop.
Spider. [Long pause]
Spider, Houston.
Go.
Roger. We're suspecting a leak in the DPS helium manifold, and, stand by one. And we'd like to have you take a look at DPS malfunction procedure number 1.
Roger. [Long pause]
Spider, Houston.
Go.
Roger. We just noticed you doing a VERB 47 there, and we'd like to have you try the initialization again.
Roger. Understand. You want us to do it again?
Stand by one.
Roger. Be advised we tried to VERB 47 two times, and it seems to come out of the PGNCS okay, but the AGS 414 never goes back to zero. [Pause]
Roger. I copy that, Spider, and I have your torquing angles while we work on that.
Roger. Just stand by just one.
Roger.
Ready to copy.
Roger. Reading your torquing angles: minus 00040, plus 00180, minus 00160. [Pause]
Roger. Copy minus 00040, plus 00180, minus 00160. [Long pause]
That's affirmative. We confirm those.
Roger. Thank you.
Houston, do you want us to close the descent helium REG 1?
And if [garble] what do you want us to do on this procedure?
Roger. We copy that, Spider. Stand by one. [Long pause]
Spider, Houston.
Go.
Roger. We would like to have you try that initialization again while we've got some data here on you.
Roger. Will do. [Pause]
Gumdrop, are you sort of angling toward the burn attitude here?
Roger. That's affirm.
Okay.
Spider, this is Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
[Garble] Spider.
Roger. We misinterpreted your question here. We would like to have you press ahead with MAL 1, and just press right ahead.
Okay. What ...
Go ahead, Spider.
You, want 10 and 12?
That is affirmative. Go ahead and press through blocks 10 and 12.
Okay. [Pause]
The downlink is in process with the AGS, Houston. [Pause]
Spider, Houston. Say that again.
Roger. We threw in a VERB 47, and doggone if it didn't go in that time.
Roger. We waved our magic wand over it through Honeysuckle, there, Spider.
You guys got what it takes with SIM SUP.
That's affirmative.
Spider, Houston. I have a little bit of info when you are ready to listen. No need to copy.
Okay, good. I'm a good listener. Be advised that our regulator pressure doesn't seem to be dropping. It's holding at about 232; that's for the DPS.
Roger. That is your regulator pressure, Spider?
That's right. We were reading off the fuel and oxidizer pressures. They are both reading 232, and have been since I closed the REG. Also, my ambient tank has been holding at about 210.
Roger. Copy 210. [Pause]
And, Spider, my little tidbit here is that during our hot-fire test, we do have a thrust chamber pressure switch failed CLOSED on thruster B4 UP. It failed on the first firing. It will have no effect to you at all with the exception that the caution and warning will not detect an OFF failure of that thruster. That is Baker 4 UP. [Pause]
Okay, will it detect an UP - stuck ON thruster?
Stand by. That is affirmative. [Long pause]
Spider, Houston. This sensor is not used in the thruster ON logic, it's strictly thruster OFF, so the answer to your question is affirmative. Caution and warning will detect a thruster ON failure.
Okay. [Long pause]
And, Houston, do you want me to press on any further with this malfunction procedure, or do you want me to open up that REG again?
Stand by, Spider. [Long pause]
Spider, Houston. We would like to have you go back to normal configuration. Open regulator 1.
Roger. it's open on COMM TECH's three, and be advised that we're just about in a posture to perform the DPS burn at this time and get some last minute checks.
Roger. Understand. I'm about to lose you at Honeysuckle. We can have you through the Huntsville with no loss. [Pause]
Roger.
Spider, Gumdrop.
Go ahead.
When we start a maneuver to burn attitude [garble].
Say again?
Roger. When we maneuver, it will be to the burn attitude [garble].
It will [garble].
Okay.
Spider and Gumdrop, if you read me, we will see you over the Redstone at 28. [Pause]
Roger. Spider reads you. [Long pause]
Gumdrop, did you read them at that time?
I think he said he would see us somewhere, sometime,
Yes, [garble].
Okay, Gumdrop, Spider. That's Redstone at 28.
Now we read you loud and clear.
Gumdrop the same.
Okay. Well, we couldn't get you through tile Huntsville with an elevation angle of 9 degrees, and we can go through the Mercury with an elevation of 0.8.
Something wrong there.
Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston through the Redstone. [Long pause]
How does the direction look to you out there? [Pause]
Spider and Gumdrop, Houston through the Redstone.
Yes, it looks like I am facing south.
I assume they gave us the docked DPS REFSMMAT, didn't they?
He's checking. [Pause]
Spider and Gumdrop. Do you read? Houston.
Gumdrop is with you.
Okay, Gumdrop, I'm copying you. Would you pass on to Spider that when he arms the DPS he may get a descent REG warning light due to the low manifold pressure.
Roger. Understand he may get a descent warning low light due to the low manifold pressure, right?
That is descent REG warning light, and be may get that when he arms the DPS.
Roger. Got you there. Descent REG warning on when he arms the DPS. You copy that, Spider?
Roger. REG warning when arm DPS.
Okay. That is what he said.
Okay. Thank you, Gumdrop. And we are standing by for your burn.
Roger.
And, Houston, do you want high bit rate here?
Houston, Gumdrop. Do you want high bit rate out of the Spider?
I copy, Spider then Gumdrop. Yes, we do want high bit rate.
Roger. Affirmative on high bit rates, Spider. [Long pause]
Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston. You are Go for the docked DPS burn.
Roger. We're GO.
Gumdrop understands GO.
And, Spider, we are copying you loud clear now.
Gumdrop, why don't you go to FREE, and we will take control here.
Roger. Gumdrop is in FREE.
I got the tape on now.
DFI POWER, ON.
And the radar is reading 81 degrees.
Okay. Our steady-state limits are 10 degrees per second, or 10 degrees and 5 degrees per second.
[Garble] 6 minutes we're going to get the PROP QUAANTITY MONITOR, ON ...
Okay.
... DESCENT 1 and 2.
Okay, Gumdrop. It looks like our attitude's about right, looking out the window here at the ground.
Roger, it looks about right to me, too.
Roger. Looks about right over here too.
It's only 1800 feet per second; it's about right - It's good enough, huh?
Yes, that's [garble] ballpark.
15 minutes [garble].
[Garble] 5 degrees, too.
Great. Let's see. Ooh, look at that.
How about that. Everything's in agreement. For some unu - unknown reason.
Boy, it's going to be brighter than hell in here.
Yes, you're right. It sure is.
Is your light up there - strongly?
Yes, it's strong.
I guess it got to launch, didn't it? No, it wasn't going to.
No, uh huh. Don't move it back too far because I want, to be able to see thee thing.
Okay.
Okay, believe it or not - we're going to switch inverters, here.
Oh, Jeez.
PROP QUANTITY MONITOR, DESCENT 1 and 2.
DESCENT 1.
Okay.
Lights work, DESCENT 2, okay.
Okay, you're in DESCENT 2.
Yes.
Okay, CB(11), EPS, INVERTER 1, CLOSE.
INVERTER 1, CLOSE.
Okay, and I'm going to INVERTER 1 over here.
Okay.
[Garble] INVERTER 1.
How are the buses looking?
Oh, I can't tell here. Hold on, I'm going to ...
Okay.
[Garble] OPEN. The buses look okay. [Garble] CLOSE to OPEN. Okay, commander's bus is at 29, systems engineer is at 30.3.
Good. Okay.
Okay, 4 minutes, TTCA throttling up.
Okay.
Okay, we might as well wait here.
Throttle, up, and on we go.
THROTTLE CONTROL to MANUAL.
THROTTLE CONTROL to MANUAL.
MANUAL THROTTLE to COMMANDER.
COMMANDER.
Verify your throttle now, by moving it.
Spider, Houston.
Yes. Go ahead.
Houston, Spider.
Roger. We are showing the AGS address 407 as 10 000, vice the checklist as 0000. [Pause]
Roger. Thank you.
You're welcome.
This damn thing ...
There's Baja California. We ought to be just about over Houston, when we do this.
Yes. Okay - [garble] REMOTE CONTROL, AUTO.
REMOTE CONTROL, AUTO.
Okay, now we'll wait and arm the descent engine here.
Yes. Okay, it's 4 minutes now.
Hey, there's a village down there. Coming up, it's going to go across the Z-axis in just a second.
There's snow on the mountains down there. Okay, let's do ENGINE ARM to DESCENT, here.
[Garble] ARM, DESCENT.
ENGINE ARM, DESCENT; verify that, okay.
You didn't get the [garble] warning light.
No.
X-TRANSLATION to 2 JETS.
2 JETS.
BALANCE COUPLES, ON.
BALANCE COUPLES, ON.

Okay.
Here I am.
HELIUM MONITORS, SUPERCRIT PRESS.
SUPERCRIT PRESS. CAMERA SEQUENCE, CLOSE.
Okay, I've got the CAM - the SEQUENCE CAMERA breaker closed.
Okay, MASTER ARM's CLOS ...
Spider, Houston.
Go.
Okay, Rusty. That 407 flipped to 10 000 again; we are recommending that you set zero and enter right around ignition. [Pause]
I'll just hit it to zero [garble]. I didn't hear what he said, but ...
Houston, you cut off there. Say again.
Roger. Your address 407 in the AGS has now gone back to 10 000; we are recommending you set up 0000 and enter right around ignition time.
Roger. Okay, now I can check my mo - my throttle. It's throttling. Okay, let's continue.
Roger. [Long pause]
Okay, is the MASTER ARM, ON?
MFSTER ARM's ON.
Okay, stand by for 2 minutes.
Let's see, turn THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO. We don't have that yet.
Yes, THROTTLE CONTROL, AUTO. Good. Thank you.
Okay.
God, is that going to be bright!
It sure is. Hooee.
Hmm.
We're really oscillating around here in yaw. At 5 degrees. Okay. 2 minutes, verify the AGS attitude errors. [Garble] 0. Okay? Go.
[Garble] reads 17:43.
A minute, 25 seconds, Gumdrop.
Roger. I'm with you. [Long pause]
Standing by for 15 seconds; SEQUENCE CAMERA, ON, will be then. Begin ullage at 10; PROCEED at 5; ignition and then you're going to ...
Going to try to get ...
... turn the MASTER ARM, OFF.
Yes.
Or try too. Then you're going to throttle up at 5 seconds after ...
Going to throttle up at 46 - 40 percent. Man, that is really bright. Alright, Houston. We're right over a white deck of clouds, and is it ever bright.
Boy, Houston. We are right over a white deck clouds and is it ever bright.
Roger. Copy. [Pause]
One minute.
Okay, 4 ...
Roger. Copy. One minute. Everything looks good. [Long pause]
Okay, I'm going to let the AGS go.
Okay, AVERAGE G coming ON.
Okay, make sure you are standing up straight, so you don't get knocked on your can.
Yes.
Okay. 28 seconds. [Pause]
You won't even feel it, hardly.
Yes.
15 seconds, Gumdrop.
Camera's on.
... camera's on; and it's going.
Roger.
Ullage on.
Ullage is on.
PROCEED. 3, 2, 1 -
Have we ENABLED it?
[Garble].
IGNITION. We got it. MASTER ARM, OFF.
Okay. Ignition.
Throttle up.
I'm throttling up to 40 percent, Dave.
It's 40 percent.
Look at that ball; my God, we hardly have any errors.
Stand by for the autopilot.
Okay. Stand by for the autopilot. Descent REG light, now.
How's the pressure; it's going down?
It's gone down ...
The pressure's gone down. Here comes the throttle up.
Hey, that pressure's going down, Jim.
Yes.
It's going back up.
Okay, the pressure dropped down to about 190, there, Houston.
Roger. We copied it, Spider.
We're fill throttle, and the attitude errors are practically nil, Davy.
Okay. Looks pretty good over here too.
Yes, and just a slightest transient.
Yes, ditto. Flying this thing [garble].
Okay. Your HP is 109 and holding.
Thank you. Got 440 to go.
I've got 443. [Pause]
SEQUENCE CAMERA coming OFF at 59. SEQUENCE CAMERA, OFF.
I'm pulling 8/10 of a lunar g in case you're interested. We're starting to get a little excursion in high yaw.
Roger, [garble].
Roger. Copy.
You surely can't see much out the tail end here.
We just threw a big hunk down on the ground there. There goes another hunk.
Yes, I saw a few pieces go, too. [Pause]
Okay.
Gee, I got 405.
Roger. So do we.
And the PGNCS and AGS are count down right together.
Okay. 109.3 on the HP.
Roger. [Pause]
Man, am I hungry.
Me too. Okay, you're standby for a ...
Looks pretty smooth.
Yes, it really is, it's going along like a dream, except for all the hunk ...
Yes, it really is. It's going along like a dream.
Except for all the hunk ...
Sure losing pieces back there; some of the foil's coming off.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. Hey, we're going over Texas right now, I think. We ought to be over Houston pretty soon.
03:30.
Okay. 03:30 here. Attitude errors are staying down to less than 1 degree.
Roger. 109.3 HP.
Okay.
We have 1100 feet per second to go.
Right with you.
Man, the AGS and the PGNCS are right together.
And for the information of the ground and the tape, the quantity is reading 76 and 74, and we don't seem to have any spurious lockups at this time.
REG ...
Roger, Spider. Houston copies.
REG pressure is holding pretty steady; it's about 232.
And the landing radar temperature is reading 95 at the present and started, out at 81.
Okay. HP is 109.3, and everything's clean over here.
Okay, same here. Looks like it's done a real good job of steering.
We've only got 890 feet per second left to go.
Yes.
I'm 885 when you called in.
Okay.
Okay.
229.
Roger. 225 here. [Pause]
Okay. Roger. I going to start my, throttle profile at 124.
Roger. [Long pause]
Okay, and the SEQUENCE CAMERA's going to come back ON at 200; you're going to throttle at 1 [garble] 4 ...
Right.
... at 10 I'm going to shut DESCENT REG 1, OFF. At cutoff ...
I've got 2 minutes.
Two minutes here. I have 704.
At ...
109.2
Roger. [Pause]
At cutoff you're going to hit the ENGINE STOP button.
At 3 seconds, right.
Right, at 3 seconds.
Your rates on all axes are less than a tenth of a degree per second.
Is that right? I'm going to go to attitude hold.
... rates look solid here.
[Garble] all that?
Yes.
Okay.
600 feet per second to go.
Right with you. [Pause]
Gee, that's looking pretty, isn't it?
Yes.
Okay. I've got about a minute, 25.
Right with you.
Okay, when I start throttle, we're going to add a lot of seconds on to that.
Roger. [Pause]
450.
420 to go. [Pause]
One minute.
One minute now.
109.2.
Roger. Ranging right in there, isn't it?
Yes, really slick.
We are getting a roll, or some sort of an oscillation now. It's got ...
Surely it's surging.
Yes. See if we're getting a roll surge. We're getting a roll, or some sort of an oscillation now, on it.
Hell, yes. We're getting slosh.
Yes, it's going - it's - we're getting slosh.
I've got 228 to go, and the camera coming back on.
Get ready for throttle profile.
Roger.
The camera's ON.
Thirty.
Okay, 124.
Okay, 170, 157, 145.
Firing the throttle, 4 percent. Going down to 10 percent. Coming back up to 40 percent. Back down to 25 percent. [Pause]
Back up again.
Okay. Coming up to 40 percent. Throttle profile complete, and just let it sit there.
Great, 27 seconds remaining.
[Garble] point one.
Roger. 24 seconds to go.
I'm going to shut down the area at 3 seconds to go. I've got 18, 16, 15, 16, 13 ...
No sweat.
12, 10, 9, 8 - get your hand out of - 6, 5, 4, 3, shutdown!
Correct ATTITUDE HOLD.
[Garble].
[Garble] attitude hold, here.
Right with you, all the way.
Okay. [Pause]
Okay, SEQUENCE CAMERA coming OFF.
Okay.
Okay, request the CSM - have it; ENGINE ARM ...
And, Spider, that was a beautiful burn. Man, you were right down the tube.
Looked pretty neat from here, too. [Pause]
ENGINE ARM to OFF.
ENGINE ARM, OFF.
Okay, proceed. Okay, you want to read him those, while I copy them?
You want our residuals, Houston?
I can copy them on your DSKY now, Spider.
Okay, very good. [Pause]
Say, you know what? You really feel that stuff sloshing around here at the end. [Pause]
Okay, - PRO; VERB 79, ENTER; 00, ENTER ...
I thought the MAX rate you got was about 3/10 of a degree per second.
Yes, with the offset that I had on my rate scale over here, I can't tell where zero is, but it didn't deviate hardly at all. [Pause]
TTC ...
No, because you were oscillating right back, too.
TTCA JETS, DOWN.
JETS, DOWN.
Verify ENGINE ARM, OFF.
ENGINE ARM, OFF.
ENGINE PUSHBUTTON STOP, RESET.
That was mighty beautiful all the way, Spider.
Okay. THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO.
THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO.
Okay. [Pause]
Okay, landing radar temperature's 100?
Roger. Landing radar temperature is 100 degrees right now.
Roger. Copy. 100 degrees end of burn. [Pause]
PROP QUANTITY MONITOR, OFF.
PROP QUANTITY MONITOR coming OFF.
Okay, INVERTER to 2. And I may get a MASTER ALARM ...
Even the EMS took care of you that time: 1740.6.
(Laughter)
Roger. [Long pause]
Okay, INVERTER 1, OPEN.
Everybody's singing the same song.
INVERTER 1, OPENED.
CROSS TIE/BALANCE LOADS, going CLOSED.
When you're in the groove, man, you got to do that! [Pause]
SEQUENCE CAMERA, OPEN.
Okay, I want to read out 500.
Even the AGS were good; the AGS 500 degrees, plus 3 [garble]. [Pause]
One's reading minus 5. And 502 is reading 0.
And Davey, we're drifting now, so you have ATTITUDE CONTROL, again.
Okay. [Long pause]
Let's see. We are, aren't we? We have a 76 in here, I think.
Yes, we do.
VERB 8 - Hit a VERB 82, ENTER.
VERB 82, ENTER. PRO.
273.0 by ...
Dave, I - our orbit - is 273.0 by 109.2.
... 109.2.
And, Spider, Houston. I copy 500 501 502, plus 3, minus 5, minus 0. [Pause]
That's a Roger, and we got a 273.0 by 109.2. Cutoff at 2 minutes; the landing radar temperature is 100 degrees.
And I got - the Gumdrop's got 271.7 by 109.1.
49:59 - 49:51.
Roger, Gumdrop. Houston, copy. [Pause]
Exciting, the way the fuel and oxide pressures dropped off, there, during the sputter.
Okay, R&D TELEMETRY CAL, ON.
Houston, you are going to get a DFI CAL.
Roger. Understand you're getting DFI CAL. [Long pause]
Houston, how long do we have to that burn 5?
Stand by one, Spider.
Okay, I'm going to get something to eat. All I've had so far today is a little bag of fruit salad. I'm about to starve to death, and I'm going to try to get something to eat right after we finish this burn.
We start the dry-out - Let's start the dry-out first.
DFI CAL complete.
Okay. DFI POWER, OFF, but don't open the - the breaker.
Spider, Houston.
DFI power is off.
Okay, LANDING RADAR breaker, OPEN.
LANDING RADAR's OPEN.
Spider, Houston.
Go ahead.
Houston, Spider.
All right, we're going to do SPS-5 at the nominal time, and that's 4 hours and a half from now.
Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Okay, you want to debrief the burn anymore?
Roger. [Pause]
Yes.
Okay, ignition was slow.
Hey, stand - stand by just 1 -
Gumdrop, Spider.
Go.
Roger. We'd like to stop at an AGS CAL attitude here somewhere.
Very well.
At ignition the chamber pressure went up very gradually to 10 percent. Slow, smooth, steady, no bump or anything. It just felt like somebody was sort of turning the water faucet on. I came OFF with the MASTER ARM, we got the - we got the MASTER ALARM on when I did that at a couple of seconds. I throttle on up to 40 percent. That throttle up I didn't make abruptly; the throttle - and the - the chamber pressure seemed to stay right together. I stopped at 40 and it did. I [garble] throttle up manually to - to automatic. We were 100 percent [garble]. Now the attitude excursions I got during this time were practically nil, and the same thing with the rate. They're just practically nil and when we throttled up to 100 percent, the same thing: they're very low attitude excursions, very low rates. Considering - that we didn't have any attitude control [garble] except at slow engine, we did very well. It ran along steadily at 100 percent or 97 - percent - The chamber pressure looked like it went up and down from about 90 to 100 percent during the burn. It went along smoothly and right at the end, we were - we were feeling some surging and it looked like it was - it was controlling a little more in yaw than I expected it would. And we got a little roll rate in, but much less than a degree per second. Then we figured really - figures - probably the - the fuel sloshing around - the fuel oxidizer sloshing around in the tanks, and was probably the slosh. Now, you couldn't really see anything in the ball. I looked carefully at it, and I didn't see any attitude excursions, and I only saw that very slight [garble] bit of roll rate, but it was in a different frequency than the thing I felt. The - PGNS, the AGS, the G&N over the command module, and everybody all counted down together. About a minute and - about 130 - turn that off - At 130 feet per second we went to manual throttle and throttled right down to 40 percent. I got hold of the throttle and let it sit there for a couple of seconds, and then down to 10 percent, then up to 40, down to 25, back up to 40, and nominally we were supposed to get there at 30 seconds. I got there, I think, at 29 seconds to go. Then we just let it cruise on out, and no trans into here again. We shut the thing down [garble] to end ...
Okay, Spider. I'll have it over to you in about 3 minutes.
Okay. We shut down at the end. Rates were very low, and we gradually pitched up; no roll and no yaw; but it pitched up very gradually, much less than a degree per second. We got the manual shutdown at about 2 or 3 seconds. We got the regulators off; and I'll let you - Russ - to tell you about that. The regulator pressure - at that time, fuel and oxidizer pressures, were 232 when we started, and they went on down to about 185, then gradually built back up again to 230, until when they ran at 232, the whole time. The SUPERCRIT PRESSURE got up to 830 during the burn and that's where it sits right now.
Looks like it might have been the quad that caused the heater light there at about 20 seconds before the cutoff.
Okay, I didn't see that.
Because quad 3 is now reading 185, 2 is reading 162, 3 is reading 185, and 4 is reading 152.
Looks like we used a fair amount of fuel in system B, too.
Couple of percent, there, huh?
Yes, and we were supposed to be off scale HIGH for a long time. And, that's interesting, tape. We're reading in the RCS quad - or the RCS quantity right now. About 99, I guess, on A, and about 97 on B, and I think they're supposed to be considerably higher than that. Too bad I don't have a - another camera; I could really take some pretty pictures. Or do we; no, it's all stowed away. There'll come another day for the pictures, I guess. We're crossing Africa. Alrighty, the temperature is 70 our fuel, 67 our oxidizer, reading 240 and 242 fuel and oxidizer; that's on DESCENT 1. DESCEIT 2 is 70, 69, 240, and 242. I think that terminates my debriefing.
I don't have much to add at all. Prop - the main propulsion quantity seemed to track pretty good. The [garble] radar climbed very slowly during the burn from about 81 at start, to close to 100, and it's now reading about 108 and the time is 49: [garble] 8:30? That's about all I've got. The HEATER caution - We got the MASTER ALARM due to shutting the MASTER ARM off right at the start.
Okay, Spider, Gumdrop. That ought to be pretty close.
Roger; that's good, if you'll go to FREE.
In FREE.
[Garble]. [Long pause]
Roger.
And, [garble] popping that I know of. The HEATER caution light on panel 2 came ON ...
Spider, Houston. [Pause]
... 50 just before the end of the burn. Go [garble]; Houston.
This is Spider. Go ahead.
Roger. Spider, we would like to ask you if, after you finish eating there, before you transfer back, if there would be any chance of getting the regulator check, checklist systems page 17. [Pause]
Yes. Okay.
Roger. We'll get it.
Okay. Thank you.
[Garble].
Okay, that's about all I've got here.
Okay.
I'm going to eat first, though, before I just drop over up here.
I'm going to turn the tape off.
Roger. I just wanted to pass that on, before you dismantled something. We would really like to see you go ahead and eat, and we'll see you over Tananarive about 13. [Pause]
Roger.
Roger. Okay, let me give you a hack, Dave.
And, Spider, we would like to have low bit rate.
Roger. Low.
What did you want, Rusty?
Nothing. Okay, tape, it's - Now, my mark is going to be 50:00:45. 4, 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
50:00:45, and I'm going to turn you off.
And, Gumdrop, you're cleared to maneuver as desired.
Okay.
Apollo 9 - excuse me. Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Gumdrop, Spider. Are you starting to clear the tunnel yet?
Okay, fine, Davey.
I think we ought to skip that REG's check. I've got to get something to eat here, and we're starting a sublimator dryout. We'll just go ahead and skip the REG's check.
Okay.
You got anything to eat over there?
Yes, Dave. I've got something to eat.
Okay, Spider, I'm ready to clear the tunnel out if you're ready to go with it.
Yes, why don't you go ahead and clear the tunnel out, Dave, so we can start getting back on the command module ECS? We've cut the sublimator off over here, and it's kind of dried out, and we want to get off of this thing.
Gumdrop, is your tunnel - is the tunnel pressurized?
That's a negative?
Okay, let us know when it is.
Say the word; we can pressurize it for you if you like.
[Garble].
Okay, we'll do it.
Hey, Dave. I pressurized the tunnel, but it might be at a higher pressure than you have there in the spacecraft. Make sure you open up that pressure valve in the tunnel hatch.
[Garble] it looks like we're getting about a 0.1 differential right now.
Okay.
Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston. Spider, we would like to have high bit rate.
Roger. High bit rate, Houston.
Roger. Copy. And I've got you through Carnarvon. You are five-square.
Roger. Understand. Five-square, and we've already started the waterboiler dryout. We will do the REG check tomorrow.
Roger. Understand. You will do the REG check tomorrow. [Pause]
And Spider - we would like - if you agree - to do a VHF B check here and secondary S-band check. [Pause]
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger, Spider. We would like to do a VHF B check here, if you agree.
Roger. We agree. Go ahead with your instructions.
Roger. Stand by one. [Long pause]
Spider, Houston. Roger. Could we get some AGS calibration data? [Pause]
Roger. Stand by.
Roger. [Pause]
Okay. You ready to copy?
Spider, let's configure your spacecraft for [garble] B operation and I will copy your calibration data as a COMM check.
Okay. We are on B. Do you read?
Okay. Carnarvon M&O, this is the Houston CAP COMM. I want you to REMOTE VHF B only. [Pause]
Carnarvon M&O, did you read? Houston CAP COMM. [Pause]
Houston, Apol - Spider. How do you read?
I'm reading you five-square. Let's go with the AGS calibration data.
Roger. The initial readings are the same as final readings before, right?
Okay.
Plus all zips, plus all zips, minus all 7's, plus 21, plus 36, and minus 20. [Pause]
Okay. We've got that on the tape. That was a little fast.
Okay. Here is the final data after the CAL. It was plus all zips, plus all zips, minus all 7's. [Pause]
Copy.
And stand by here.
Roger.
Hey, I beg your pardon. I powered down before I read them out.
Roger. Understand.
Stand by just one. I'll power back up and read them out. [Long pause]
Okay, Houston. Are you still with us?
That is affirmative. We've got you here for another 6 minutes or so across Carnarvon.
Okay. 54445 and 46 read: plus 7, plus 28, and plus 0.
Roger. Copy plus 7 plus 28, plus 0. Thank you very much, and we do have a good VHF B system. Could you give us a secondary S-band check as per system 28 at this time? [Pause]
Roger. Stand by. [Pause]
And Carnarvon M&O this is Houston CAP COMM. I would like for you to REMOTE S-band back to Houston. [Long pause]
Okay, Houston. How do you read now?
I'm reading you loud and clear, Spider.
Okay. That's step 1. I'm ready to go to step 2.
All right. Let's go to step 2. [Long pause]
Okay, Houston.
How do you read now?
Spider, this is Houston. Do you read?
Roger, Houston. How do you read Spider?
That's beautiful. That's loud and clear, Spider.
Roger. Same here.
Okay. That takes care of that. We are ready for step 3.
Roger. Going to step 3. [Long pause]
Okay, Houston. How do you read Spider now?
You are five-square, Rusty. That is real nice. Everything sounds great on that check. And while we've got you in the mood, would you care to do an S-band backup voice check? That's on page ...
He doesn't come in worth a damn on PRIMARY.
Alright.
Houston, Spider. Try that once again.
While we've got you in the mood, would you care to try an S-band backup voice check as per systems 27?
Roger. I just got the last two words of that. Say again. [Pause]
An S-band backup voice check, as the checklist system 27. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Okay, Houston, how do you read on backup voice?
Houston, this is Apollo 9 - or Spider. How do you read on backup voice?
Houston, this is Spider. How do you read on backup voice?
Spider, this is Houston. Loud and clear. How me? [Pause]
Roger. You're 5 square. How do you read me now?
Spider, this is Houston. How do you read me on the backup voice? [Pause]
You're 5 square, Houston. How do you read me?
Spider, this is Houston. I'm reading you loud and clear. How do you read me? [Pause]
Gumdrop, Spider, this is Houston through Carnarvon.
Houston, how do you read Spider now?
[Garble] is better now.
Gumdrop, 5 by.
Spider, you're loud and clear. How me?
I'd like to go private with you.
You cut each other ...
Okay, you are five-square. I'm supposed to be able to talk to you without pushing PIT. I'm not sure I'm getting backup voice down to you. Tell me if you read up through 5 and back down. 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1.
Okay. Spider, Houston. You blanked out at 3 on the way up and came in with 3 on the way down.
Okay. I was using PTT up to 3 and from 3 on down, and I understood the backup voice was supposed to go right off the intercom.
Spider, check BIOMED OFF, and give me another fast check. [Pause]
Roger. The BIOMED is OFF.
Roger. Verify BIOMED OFF. [Pause]
Okay, Spider. We've got you through Honeysuckle now. How are you reading me? [Long pause]
Houston, how do you read Spider?
Spider, this is Houston through Honeysuckle. How do you read me? [Pause]
Roger. Reading you 5 square. How me?
[Garble].
Okay, Spider. I could hear you transmitting there. You were way down and breaking up. How about giving me a short count here? We are supposed to be locked up on you.
One, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, [garble] Spider out.
Okay, Spider. You are relatively clear, but way, way down.
[Garble] what did you want with the biomed?
[Garble] BIOMED. [Long pause]
It is off.
Houston, did you want the - something done with the biomed?
Houston, Spider. Over.
Aw - Houston, Spider.
Houston, Spider. Over.
Spider, this is Houston. We'd like to have you return to COMM basic. [Long pause]
Roger. Going back to COMM BASIC. And I'm going back to VHF A.
Is that tunnel open?
Spider, this is Houston. I'd like to have you return to COMM basic and give me a check.
Roger, Houston. We are COMM basic. How now?
Okay. You're coming through clear now, Rusty. And we get the backup voice check in. It just way down low. [Pause]
Roger.
And we'd like to have the BIOMED switch on the LMP for the rest of the time, Spider. [Pause]
Spider, Gumdrop.
Yes, Gumdrop; Spider.
The tunnel is clear.
Okay, very good. [Garble].
Roger. It is on the LMP, Houston.
Roger. Understand. Thank you, Spider.
Be advised we are presently 28 minutes into the sublimator dryout. [Pause]
Roger Spider. I copy that. 28 minutes into the dryout. [Pause]
Roger, and be advised that we have a great deal more equipment powered up than we were supposed to during this dry-out. We're running a little behind in getting the tunnel clear.
Roger and [garble].
Okay, Spider. You are breaking up. You will have to repeat that for me, please. [Pause]
I'll finish up the checklist, Jim.
No VHF -
Okay, Spider and Gumdrop. I think we are about to drop you here at Honeysuckle. We'll be over Huntsville in a couple of minutes if you want to talk there and Hawaii at 59.
Did you get an EVA checklist, Jim, over there?
No, I didn't. Let me get this - let me get this stuff out of the way so we can get the hatch open. [Garble].
Okay.
[Garble].
Soon as you get that hatch open, we want to go to EGRESS.
What?
I say we want to go to EGRESS mode.
Yes. Okay, let's do that.
Okay. Go.
PULL the EGRESS. [Garble].
The REG's to EGRESS, right.
[Garble] A, [garble] B.
Spider, Gumdrop.
[Garble].
My, it stare takes you guys a long time to open that little hatch here.
[Garble] ready for us?
Sure. Been ready for 10 minutes.
Okay, we'll be opening in a second here. [Garble] ready, Jim.
Okay, I have the hatch open now.
[Garble].
Okay, ready?
[Garble] get that umbilical down here, and I got to get off this suit loop.
I know it.
Tell him to send the umbilical through.
That's going to be hard for you to get through, Jim.
What?
That's going to be too hard for you to get through.
Are you - Do you want me to sit here and clear this stuff out, Rusty, or -
Okay, Jim.
You sure?
Yes, thanks.
Hey, Dave? Hey, Dave? Hey, Dave?
What do we need to take back with us to the [garble]? The EVA checklist -
EVA checklist, and the Flight Plan card. The sequence camera and the lenses.
That's right. I checked - I checked the [garble].
[Garble] the camera.
Okay. Hey, Russ, let me [garble] here.
Okay.
We'll make a transfer and see if [garble].
Okay.
[Garble].
Yes.
[Garble] I'll be back in just a second.
Rusty, do you [garble]?
I [garble] think so.
[Garble] Well, come over here [garble] gloves on.
Dave, [garble] Dave. Dave, [garble].
Make that [garble].
[Garble].
[Garble].
I don't think so. Hey, let me plot one more point on it here.
[Garble].
No.
Okay, I'll take [garble] over there.
Slow down. And I pass that umbilical back.
Got it, Dave?
Alright.
Gumdrop, Spider.
Go ahead [garble].
Did you ever mount your [garble]?
Roger. Stands by. Not yet.
What do you need?
Just checking the COMM. [Long pause]
And Gumdrop, this is Houston. We've got you through Hawaii now.
Gumdrop. Roger. [Long pause]
Anything else you wanted, Rusty?
Yes, you got to get that checklist going fast. Shoot, I can't get my hose plugged in. God damn it.
Gumdrop, Houston. We'd like to turn the heaters and H2 tanks 1 and 2 off.
Okay. Have to stand by for that one.
Roger. Understand. No sweat. [Pause]
Okay. I'd like to give flow to you. [Pause]
Gumdrop, can you give me call? [Pause]
You've got full flow, haven't you?
I don't know; I can't tell.
Yes, I gave it to you when you first called it. [Long pause]
Okay. I'm going to switch COMMS so give me a few seconds and then turn my suit power off.
Okay.
Houston, say again the heaters and fans.
Roger, Gumdrop. We would like to turn off the heaters in both H2 tanks.
Roger. Both H2 heaters OFF.
Roger. Thank you.
Gumdrop, Houston. You might watch your middle gimbal.
Roger. Thanks, Houston; got an eye on it. [Pause]
We got two eyes on it. [Pause]
Houston, this is the Spider.
Go, Spider.
Roger. We've been running the dry-on now for 52 minutes and we are just starting the circulator pull out and the glycol temperature is right now 70 degrees. We are [garble] through it. [Long pause]
Roger. Copy.
And Gumdrop, this is Houston. Just to remind you again about the gimbal lock. You are just making us nervous.
Roger. We've got somebody in the couch watching it at all time now.
All right. Okay. Thank you.
Houston, this is Gumdrop. How do you read?
Gumdrop, we read you loud and clear.
Okay, this is Spider. I figure our water boiler is dry at 57 minutes, and we have a lot of power on, and I want to give you a CAL here.
Roger. You must be a mind reader; that's just what we were thinking.
Houston, this is Apollo 9.
Calling Houston. Say again, please; I didn't get it, Gumdrop. [Long pause]
Gumdrop, this is Houston. I did not copy your last transmission. [Long pause]
Gumdrop, this is Houston. I did not copy your last transmission.
Gumdrop, this is Houston. How do you read?
Five-by, Houston. Go.
Roger, I'm reading you real good now. I couldn't copy off Texas there. You made a transmission; I did not get it.
Roger, Houston. This is Apollo 9, we would like to know what the position of our translunar bus tie circuit breakers are supposed to be. They are both circuit breaker panel 11 and 16.
Roger, Apollo 9. Copy. Stand by.
Just for when we're leaving the spacecraft.
Roger. Understand. [Long pause]
Okay, Apollo 9. Those translunar bus tie circuit; breakers are to be OPEN, I say OPEN.
Both of them will be OPEN. Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston. About 1 minute LOS Vanguard. We will see you over Ascension at 36.
Roger.
Apollo 9, this is Houston through Ascension. Standing by.
Roger, Houston. Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. No need to acknowledge, but we are showing you with - you'll probably get a MASTER ALARM in about a minute on the H2 pressure.
Houston, you are off by about 59 seconds on that one. It came on while you were talking. Very good.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 9, Houston, through Carnarvon, standing by.
Roger, Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger. We're going to have you here for about 11 minutes at Carnarvon, and if you can handle it we would like to initiate a waste water dump at this time and dump it down to 25 percent.
Okay, waste water down to 25. We're all back in the Gumdrop, the tunnel is closed out, and everything looks okay.
Say, sounds great, Apollo 9. [Long pause]
And, Apollo 9, this is Houston. Just at your convenience, when you have a couple of three minutes to talk I've got several questions that can be handled at any time. I'd just like to start working down the list before we get too close in to the burn.
Okay, stand by.
Roger. [Long pause]
Go ahead Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger. There are a couple of questions we have, and one is on the adjustment of this VOX sensitivity during our COMM test. We're trying our best to troubleshoot some of our difficulties, and we would like to have any comments that you could give us in that regard.
Well, we finally ended up with the VOX sensitivity about 8 and a half or 9. We still weren't getting the PLSS to the ground, though. We should read him from ...
I'm sorry, you broke out there, Apollo 9, said you could read and then say again all after.
I'm thinking.
Oh, okay. I'm sorry. [Long pause]
Houston, we were reading - we had communications from the PLSS to the CSM, from the CSM back to the PLSS. I guess we were just having trouble getting to the ground, and even though I had the VOX sensitivity up to about 8 and a half or 9, which is about as high as it goes, we still weren't able to get him to trigger the VOX, I guess.
Roger, copy, and you know I wasn't getting the CSM at all, in the Texas-Mila pass, and down over the Mercury you came in loud and clear. It looked like, at one time there during the Mercury, we were going to have real good COMM, and then it got ratty again. Okay, that's enough of that one, then, unless TELL-COMM will come up with some more questions. If you have anything else to add on it they would like to take it at this time.
No, I don't believe so.
Okay, And I'm curious about the foil coming off of the Spider during the burn. Were they, you know, large chunks, small, is there anything you would like elaborate on that?
I couldn't say. The stuff I saw I couldn't say for sure was foil. I think Dave said that - just a minute.
Yes, looked like there were some pieces, maybe 2 to 3 inches square in area, but not square in dimension. They weren't clean pieces like something that was supposed to be there left. It looked it might have been scraps or something that had been hanging loose, but I did see some that were black and some that were partially black and silver, and they came off pretty fast, so it was hard to track them.
That's kind of - They stayed with us. They didn't look like they were being shot out of the engine or anything. They stayed with us and we sort of left them, but not too rapidly, and they were sort of down between from us toward the ground, and I couldn't tell exactly where they originated.
Yes, I couldn't tell where they came from either.
Okay, Apollo 9, copied that. That was a real good description, and the other question I was wondering if you would care to comment if in all that hubbub if you had a change to try out the LM drinking fountain.
Roger. I did, and there seemed to be appreciably less water in the LM system than there was - I mean in the LM system than there is in the command module. It's much better over there.
Okay. How was the temperature of the water? [Pause]
It was pretty good; it was cool. It was very tolerable.
Okay, sounds great, and I would like, if you haven't buried them, the battery voltages and so forth that was on the closeout checklist, they're system 74, at your convenience. [Long pause]
Battery check voltages, Houston?
I'm ready to copy, Apollo 9.
Roger. Batteries 1 through 4 with 31 volts. Battery 5 and 6 were 37. Commander's BUS and System Engineer's BUS were 31 and 31. ED BAT A was 36.5, ED BAT B was 37.2.
Roger, very good, Apollo 9. We got those. [Pause]
Tonight, probably after this next burn, I'd like to go over with you what we are going to do tomorrow.
Okay, very good, we agree to that.
Do you have a plan for us, or are you open for suggestions, or what?
Roger. We would rather wait until after the burn and then we can get together and have a meeting of the minds.
Okay.
That pretty well takes care of my list. One other question: I take it from your comments that the rendezvous self test, we never did get any good, valid data from that, is that affirmative?
Not consistent, no. Occasionally, one time we got the range to come into the computer and three or fours times maybe for range rate; but from the computer ten times we got nothing.
It wasn't anything we could pin it down to.
Okay, copy that and just as a last items I would like to alert you I'll be calling you again right after SPS fire that we want to initiate a charge on battery B.
Okay.
And that's all I have. We are going to have you here for about another minute and a half and then we will see you - We can talk through the Huntsville about 25; if not, Hawaii at 35. [Long pause]
Okay, we speak sayanora at Carnarvon, Apollo 9 and we would just like to have you take a look at the middle gimbal.
We'll watch it.
Okay, we are too.
Seems like we are getting some disturbance torque as we go around.
Roger, copy.
Okay, I go back and get it going the other way? I'm down here, down this way? It's going this way!
I should have called you up and accused you of firing the thrusters, but I knew you weren't.
Oh boy, that stuff's really terrible.
What's that?
Chicken with vegetables.
I had that last night; I thought it was pretty good.
I bet!
(Laughter) When you guys (laughter) started to get ready for the burn, I realized you were going to go backwards, so I had to run around here and get everything that wasn't settled to go plus X, and fix it to go minus X.
Hey, there isn't hardly any storage here at all.
No.
I was disappointed. I braced myself against the panel.
That's a pretty good burn, you know it?
Right.
[Garble] 6 or 8 minutes of it.
Yes, but I mean it was - it was well-guided, much better than in the simulator.
Yes.
Gosh! It's hard to believe - hardly ...
Here.
Oh, here, let me cut it for you.
... hardly any excursions and - looked pretty good.
We've got to figure out some way of getting this dirt out of here.
Boy, you're not kidding.
I got a piece in my eye a little while ago. I got a piece of hair in my mouth.
You want to close it?
Thought I'd caught you.
Is the hand controller on?
Sir?
Is the hand controller on?
What I'm going to do next time is to set that 50-degree deadband around zero, and let it do it. It's just not working.
Yes.
Chase, chase, chase. And I bet I've spent more gas chasing it ...
Yes.
Than letting it deadband.
You're darned right.
What do we have to do during the alignment?
Next night pass.
I'd like to get some cold water one of these [garble].
Pardon me.
That's quite true of spaghetti. You know, I dream about oxygen. Black ox ...
Lots of croutons, huh?
If you'll hand it over this way, Rusty, I'll get it.
Hand it up here, and I'll squeeze it.
Are we on our way out of that gimbal-lock area now?
Yes, I think so, because -
I'm sure I can't see it now.
Okay.
I think we're awfully close.
Here you go, Rusty.
Can I take a drink?
Yes.
Probably going out the other side.
No, it's not - it's in the same place; it went back in.
You don't suppose there's some magnetic anomaly?
Turning itself - The turning is along the flight path, and it's - The ball aligns.
(Laughter)
That stuff doesn't dissolve.
You got to squeeze it.
I just did [garble] I didn't see much meat in it.
Oh boy, is it going to feel good to get that suit off tonight!
Sounded like the TV was good.
Hey, Jim, tell you what. Tell me where that water stuff is, if you've got time.
Well, one fitting - Dave, it's a fitting about this long, with the QD on one side and the screw-in on the other.
Okay.
Well, right up on the top end.
Okay.
In that little box, where Rusty's sitting.
Yes, I know - I know where you mean.
You see it?
Not yet.
Alright.
Okay.
Now you want to get the toolkit out.
(Cough)
You know where that is?
Yes. I'm going to take Rick Nigel's job when I get back. (Coughing)
We want - which one?
Take the whole toolkit.
You want the one to - you want that - (coughing)
You want to cap it.
Here's the [garble], Dave. Where do you want that?
Now I'll get tool E.
There was one right over here.
Okay.
Really? There's only one? No, I got the one that you gave me this morning. There's only one, isn't there?
No, I had the other one out and had it right over here, just for Dave.
B or E? The screwdriver?
Oh, E.
Okay -
That son of a buck doesn't want to get out of gimbal lock.
Very slowly.
I had it very slowly going out, too, and then it started slowly going back in.
I think we're trimming - along the flightpath.
Oh, oh!
Don't lose it! Did you lose it?
No, I got it. I wonder what happened to the wire? We capped it.
It was?
Right. It's not anymore. Lots of wire down there, but it doesn't do any good.
Okay, give me that fitting.
There's a lot of hose.
Which end would you like?
I want the -
That's the wrong end.
I know. There should he a filter on that end down there, Dave.
I put the filter away this morning.
Oh, okay, plus it right in the - urine, huh?
Yes. You got that thing going right over you.
Well, gee, that's just a little black hose. It doesn't even compete with the other ones. Okay, now you have it rolling down the back of your suit. I'll get out of the way and [garble] now.
(Cough)
Apollo 9, this is Houston. We've got you through Hawaii. Standing by, eyeing the old gimbal.
Roger. We're dumping the water.
Roger. [Pause]
You know, we've been sitting watching this gimbal, too, and I've been chasing the thing all day long. It seems to seek the red bullet - the red dot in the center of this thing, and I wonder if we are not trimming along the flight path angle. What would you say to that?
By jove, I believe that requires some heavy concentration on our part.
Well, it will give you something to do tonight.
What you are trying to say is, you are being stabilized with the gravity gradient, then?
I guess I don't really know what I'm saying, is the reason why. I don't really understand it, but it seems to seek the in-planeness, even when you get it sort of moving away from the gimbal lock area, it stops and starts to move back unless you have enough rate. If you have enough rate to move away permanently, it will swing around to the other side.
By jove, that's a real good observation. How about vertically? Is it trying to align itself vertically too, along the gravity gradient?
No, I don't think so. I haven't noticed that so much, just seems in any roll orientation, it seems to want to go to the in-planeness. I guess maybe we can watch the vertical alignment tomorrow to see if it is gravity gradient.
Okay. I've got another question for you, Dave? Did you get any alarms during the day from the tyro tanks?
No, not a one. Not until you called. That was the first one.
Okay, thank you. [Long pause]
Hey, Smoky?
Go ahead.
You know, now that I think about it, I guess maybe 70 - 80 percent of the time today, I've been able to see the horizon out of the hatch window.
Roger.
Which sort of means maybe it is pulled by grav.
My goodness. Maybe we've come up with something here that will become an international law or something, you know, like F = MA.
Say, now. Wouldn't that be something?
Tremendous.
Gumdrops Houston.
Go ahead Houston.
Roger. We'd like to have P00 and ACCEPT please. We have a state vector and a target load for you, and you might start fumbling for a maneuver pad; I'll have one for you when you're ready to copy on this SPS-5. [Pause]
Roger. You have P00 and ACCEPT and we are ready to copy.
Okay. I'll be ready in about one minute. [Long pause]
Okay, Gumdrop, this is Houston with the PAD.
Go.
Roger. Reading SPS-5: 054 26 1120, minus 02109, minus 03775, plus 03796 05754 05673 0432 30545, plus 110, minus 080 25 17610 28 800, minus 0388, plus 13076 1769. And I'd like to pass the LM weight - is 21860. [Pause]
Roger. Can you give me the shaft angle again, please?
Roger. Reading the shaft angle: 17610. And under remarks, I have your gimbal angles that will give you 90 degrees out of plane in case of the early shut down. Reading: roll, all zips; pitch, 040; yaw 030. End of update. [Pause]
Roger. Stand by just one on the readback.
Roger. Standing by for the readback, and the computer is yours. You have been loaded a state vector and a target load. [Long pause]
Okay, Smoky. Do you have a preferred time on those angles? I realize that they are out of plane all the time, but do you have a preferred time or anything on them?
That's negative; just under the [garble] in all the ground rules that we had; just as soon as possible, once you determined the cause and feel like kicking it off again.
Okay, here comes the readback: 054 26 1120, minus 02109, minus 03775, plus 03796 05754 05673 0432 3054 - oops, excuse me - 30545, plus 110, minus 080 25 17610 28 800, minus 0388, plus 13076 1769. And understand roll 0, pitch 40, yaw 30; we're 90 out of plane, LM weight 21860.
Roger. Houston confirms the update. It looks good.
Thank you.
Lo and behold, you're going to be [garble] going to the John, Dave.
Hmm, let me set the control for you.
What were those gimbal angles again, Rusty?
What?
Did it go up?
You're all set [garble].
Would you shut off the vent, Dave? It feels cold. It feels like [garble].
Yes.
Well. I wonder why [garble].
It looks like there's a big bag on there, doesn't it?
Yes, I know.
Gumdrop, this is Houston through Ascension. Standing by.
Roger, Houston. This is Apollo 9 here.
Roger, Apollo 9.
We're just getting ready to start the P52.
Roger, copy.
And we followed that, Apollo 9. [Pause]
Oh, very well, thank you.
Roger.
Yes. Yes. 25 degrees. 20 or [garble].
Hardly any [garble].
Really?
[Garble]. What did you say about 25 degrees, Dave?
Well, folks, we might not get the attitude in time to get a star check for the burn.
Yes, I - I see that. If you could do it [garble].
[Garble] do a good job here.
I'm not sure [garble] on this deal.
I get [garble].
Yes.
Even though it [garble].
[Garble] sleepy [garble] stop.
[Garble]. What do you want to do with these?
[Garble].
No.
Yes, that - that's silly.
Okay, [garble].
Yes, we should be coming on [garble] a star like this one.
Yes, I've got the Big Dipper again.
Right where we started. [Garble] than this, Jim.
No, I'm not; but if we just get the [garble], I think we're going to get a lot more stars in the [garble].
Oh, okay.
Yes, okay, I see [garble].
There's a couple of big [garble] not too many.
Seems the Apollo [garble] won't roll.
Who put this on starboard? [Garble] a light come on for that.
Oh! (Laughter) That's Dave.
No, I didn't think that [garble] would do it.
Shit, [garble] right to it.
[Garble].
You that far?
Yes. You don't think we can do it, Dave?
No, [garble].
Yes, that's what I've been doing [garble] Flight Plan.
Yes. It is, too.
You're right, Jim.
Well, that [garble] was planned.
Let it stay down here for this time. [Garble] I come back up here.
Dave, you want to change my hoses over to the right side?
Okay. Come here. [Garble]. You want all these helmets and gloves off?
Yes.
[Garble] on this thing.
You want - you want to try to make a third star check when we get there, Jim?
Go ahead.
You [garble] stars in here [garble] alright, Rusty.
Yes? You want to use their star check? We've never had one yet. Oh, I'll try. If we have to [garble] up there, I'll try it.
Alright, let's see.
I don't want to put a light on it [garble].
I ought to go back up and wrap around.
I know.
Make sure it's alright, Jim.
Hey, how do you like that?
Rusty's...
Turn that thing off. [Garble]. Okay?
Hey, I got - I'll do my COMM, too.
Okay.
Hey, you got my air [garble], Dave?
Yes.
Apollo 9, Houston through Tananarive. [Pause]
Hello, Houston; Apollo 9. Hello, Houston; you read Apollo 9?
Where's my helmet? Is that it down there?
[Garble].
[Garble] that silly gravel out there, Jim.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. We will see you over Carnarvon at 44. [Pause]
Okay, Houston; Apollo 9.
Oh, you've got that strut there now.
I think we could probably take that strut down. Dave, we're not using that [garble], are we?
[Garble] Dave have to leave it there.
(Laughter) We're not using that support strut any more, are we?
That's okay; it's not in my way.
Are you getting around here?
Okay.
Okay.
It's alright.
It's alright, Dave.
What?
Ohh!
(Yawn)
Apollo 9, Houston, we have you through Carnarvon.
Hello there, Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger loud and clear.
Roger. Same with you. We are over Hawaii drifting slowly over towards deep burn attitude. [Pause]
Houston, roger. [Pause]
Apollo 9, Houston. You are go for SPS-5.
Roger. Go for SPS-5.
Bypass the - RESTART routine, and exit the program. Okay?
Okay.
Your input's 47? You [garble] a DELTA-V [garble] minus Y [garble] put a time in [garble]. Is the meter on?
There's no light.
Yes, yaw is 30 degrees.
[Garble].
Yes, we're going [garble] that [garble] should be going backwards, turning to the north with - down. Not this way. So, what we'll do is we'll just come up and yaw. Okay?
Roll right.
Roll right.
What?
Okay.
But I would think you'd probably want to [garble].
At 4 or 5 feet per second [garble].
All we're trying to do is satisfy the DELTA-V for the [garble].
Okay.
Then you have to go back and retarget it for the -
Yes, you know that - that was almost three times the [garble] and one time, it's four times as [garble].
[Garble].
You want to take this [garble] down, or can you read it okay? [Garble].
Have any trouble with your head yesterday? Your head - holding it up?
With my head?
Holding it up during the burn?
You're going to do what?
Trying to see if I can [garble].
What if you can't?
Burgie hasn't seemed to be much help to us on this, has he? (Laughter)
Who?
Burgie.
Apollo 9, Houston through Guam. Standing by.
Hello there, Houston, through Guam. How are you today?
Roger. Good shape.
It is nice to talk to you in the day time. You keep waking me up in the morning.
It's better for me too.
I guess somebody must be getting easy on you down there, right?
9, Houston, say again.
Roger. Whoever is doing the scheduling must be getting easy on you.
Yea concur.
Houston, Apollo 9. We just completed our daylight star check, and low and behold, a star was there.
Hey great.
Apollo 9, Houston. One minute LOS, Hawaii at 12.
Roger, Hawaii at 12. Oky-doky. [Long pause]
Hey, Ron, is Sonny there with you?
Is who with me?
Oh, never mind. I'll get you over Hawaii.
Roger.
Smokey is still here.
No, Sonny, Sonny Morton.
Yea. He's here too.
Okay.
(Laughter) You dirty rat, McDivitt ...
Hello Jimmy.
Oh, boy. Oh, (laughter) ye gods!
How much time we got, Jim?
20 minutes.
Be right here.
I think - I think this thing is trimming, you know that? [Garble] although they still say zero.
I'll try a [garble].
Okay, how many feet, for sure?
(Laughter) What you doing down there?
Boy, that DELTA-V counter is really drifting.
Did you get it set?
No.
5 - 7.3.
7.3.
How low are we supposed to let the cryos go?
We did?
The fans are supposed to be ON now?
No. You want the fans OFF - both?
[Garble] reading 700.
Want me to do the reading this time, Rusty?
No, I'm - I'm okay.
Okay. It may be better to do something.
Yes, oh yes, I think it would be.
Boy, that rendezvous Window is really getting clouded up, isn't it?
I think the windows are doing pretty damn well!
Well, I do, too.
All of them except the rendezvous window.
Mine is doing great over here. There's not any on it at all.
I didn't even get a chance to look at this - that sight. I looked up there at one time to see if it was [garble] and it was, and then I tried to put the COAS up for you.
Yes.
I turned it on for you a couple of times, but you couldn't get me.
Yes?
It works.
I think I found out at one time that [garble].
Yes. I seem to recall it. Had your curtain drawn at night, didn't you?
Huh?
You had your upper curtain drawn.
Oh, yes.
Hey, did - did you start up the glyc - the evaporator this morning, or not?
No, huh uh, no.
Take it or leave it.
Leave it go.
Apollo 9 Houston through Hawaii, standing by.

Roger. Delta-VC is 9.9.
Roger. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 9. Did you copy our HA and HP?
Roger. We copy. 129.6; 127.7.
Okay.
Hey, that was a pretty burn.
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 9, Houston. Request the BATT B charging, as soon as you get to it.
Roger. In work.
Roger. [Long pause]
Okay. BATT B on charge, Houston, and we're drawing 2 and one quarter amps on it.
9, Houston. Roger. We copy. [Long pause]
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We'll be going private over Antigua in about 35.
Okay [garble].
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger, We see you are in Program 6 right now. Just be advised we want to give you your state vector before you power down.
Oh, gracious.
Roger. We'll bring the CMC back on the line.
Roger. [Pause]
You're pretty fast. [Pause]
When it gets close to time to rest, we're really in motion.
Say again.
I said when it gets close to time for - for the time for us to start resting, we really get in motion.
I noticed that.
[Garble]. You go ahead.
Deke, this is Rusty. I'm not sure that it's not a combination of things, but I think it is related to motion also. And unless I can get some food in me, and keep it in me, I'm not going to be feeling much better. Now, I'm planning to try and eat up a stor[garble] tonight, but, in all frankness, I sure won't have much appetite.
Well, the Marezine doesn't help you much, huh?
Well, it's kind of hard to say. This morning, I took a Marezine before breakfast, and then very shortly after breakfast, it all came back up - in the middle of all that commotion that we were - that we were going through, getting ready to get through that tunnel. I would guess that, under the same circumstances tomorrow morning, it'd probably be very much the same.
Roger.
And another thing, Deke, I think we've got to stretch out the - we got to get a little extra time in here. Today I had a bag of fruit salad and a bag of cocoa or something like that for breakfast. About 12 hour later is - I have time to eat. And I think that if - We don't want to attack that rendezvous, which is about an 18-hour day, like that.
I couldn't agree more; we'll have to take a look at the book.
I think if we have enough time tomorrow, to prepare the spacecraft pretty good tomorrow night, then we can get up in the morning, and maybe get to bed a little earlier, get up in the morning the next day, and probably make that timeline.
Roger. I just wanted to make one comment on this private loop so you all understand it. We are summarizing it down here; it's not being released word by word, but it is being summarized to the press. I don't know if you guys understood that or not, so we don't want you to hold back telling anything you think is appropriate. But you should understand that it is being summarized. It is considered [garble].
Roger; I understand that.
And we'd like to express our thanks to you for doing a great job today. It was outstanding.
Well (laughter), we're just up here, trying to do what we've been practicing for a few years. I'll tell you, we sure got a lot of comments on how to operate in the spacecraft with suits on and with three - three great big pairs of hoses. Also, I'll tell you off the record here, [garble] if we're still in private - (cough)
Yes, we're [garble].
There's a lot of little things that have to be fixed up (cough) to make this spacecraft really operable inside - like ...
I think they're gone, Jim.
... like numbering those God-blessed lithium hydroxide cans.
Oh, yes.
And that water ...
That LM. Nothing's fit for that God-blessed LM, Dave. I - Hey, do you know that - the OPS came - pallet came loose during that burn - (cough) [garble].
Did it really?
Yes, it went floating around when I went back to get it.
Oh, boy.
There's not - I bet you there's not 50 percent of the things over there that work.
Where are we?
You know something?
Oh shit, no, I didn't [garble].
I was going to say, boy, that water that I got, chlorinated water, taste [garble] either.
Hey, this - this is terrible, this water here.
We haven't - we haven't chlorinated it yet, have we, today?
No.
Okay, look. Let's get our food before we chlorinate it.
When are we due to do that stuff, David?
I don't know, but, boy, I don't want to eat food with all that crap in it again.
It'll still have to be chlorinated.
But it's not - I've been tasting it - it's not as bad as it was last night. I'll tell you, that - that - that water I had last night burned my mouth when I put it in there.
Jim, could you wait just a second? Hey, Jim?
Yes.
Let me get this stuff put back together here before you come down.
[Garble] right over here [garble].
Be with you in just a second, Jim.

[Garble].
Yes. Let's see what the Flight Plan says here.
55.
[Garble].
So am I. I got some last night. I was coughing last night.
[Garble] and go chase it. Yes, take one in the other hand, too, and blow.
Okay.
You say anything about a purge, Jim or Dave?
Well, they did say to activate the water, though.
No, they never have. And I guess that means do it. I - Let's see, where's our next station pass? Ascension we want at 46. We just had Ascension, didn't we?
Yes. What's next?
Pretoria? 55:05.
Tananarive.
Dave, I didn't [garble].
Yes.
Okay, I'll just get the cryo fans.
Why don't we ask them what they want when we get there?
Alright.
Let's start eating then. Yes, why don't you just eat, and let's just ask then what they want done with the fan, because they've been different ...
Now, let me see if there's something else I can do here. Waste water dump; we already did that. WASTE MANAGEMENT OVERBOARD DRAIN, OFF; WASTE STOWAGE VENT, CLOSED; S-BAND, OMNI B; and COMM, basic. Which is A duple - Oh, what are we going to do tonight on the COMM? Could it - Probably [garble] A SIMPLEX, [garble], I guess.
Yes, A SIMPLEX.
EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE to BOTH. Have we got the cabin pressure configured yet?
Yes. I been doing that off and on today several times.
Okay. SURGE TANK, ON. I'm sure it is. PLSS, OFF.
I'll check it.
Yes?
Yes.
LM TUNNEL VENT to LM PRESS.
Yes.
SYSTEMS TEST to 4 Delta.
Here it is.
Onboard readouts to MSFN. Okay, I'll get that stuff. Where's the log, Dave?
It's in - The crew log? It's over where you can log them in.
Oh, yes, that's right.
Hey, you know, I found today the 70-millimeter thing - We started on the last page.
Yes, I know. I took that on the 16-millimeter, didn't I?
Yes. Well, it's - I don't know; it's hard to tell those tabs really are meaningful.
Well, at times, they're -
You want me to help?
Put the time in.
Oh, okay. 54:48:37.
You want to give me a service module RCS [garble].
Yes. Quad A, 75; B, 76; C, 69; D, 69. Oh, I'm sorry. 74, 74. I'm sorry.
I was saying: Man, we really ate it out of those today.
Yes, pardon me.
Okay, I need - I need the systems test meter stuff, Jim.
Coming up.
5 C, D, and which one of those other things?
[Garble] 5 C and D? [garble]?
Right.
Let's see, [garble].
Okay, thank you.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Oh hell.
We're supposed to be using about 4 percent out of everything - 5 percent out of everything except Bravo. And Bravo we use 8 percent.
Yes, we used lots of gas today.
How are we on our redline?
Well, we dropped a little low on it; we lost today. But I'm not surprised with all that damn running in the gimbal lock every 5 minutes.
[Garble]?
Yes.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Houston; go.
Roger. We've got consumable status for you here.
Roger. We're ready to copy.
Okay, service module RCS, A, B, C, D. Ready to copy?
Go.
75, 76, 74, 74.
75, 76, 74, 74.
Roger. BAT C, 37.0; PYRO A, 37.1; B, 37.1. [Pause]
Roger.
And we've got the command module injector temperatures for you.
5 Charlie, off scale high; 5 Delta, 4.85; 6 Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta, all off scale high.
Roger. All off scale high except 5 Delta and, it's 4.85.
That's for Charlie. I mean that's affirmative. (Laughter)
Okay. We show you 129.1 by 123.6. We're refining it, but it looks okay.
Hmm!
Roger. Do you have any words on a purge tonight?
You're getting a lot out of plane here. Is that 11 feet per second?
Say again. Words on a purge?
Roger. Do you want us to purge the fuel cells tonight?
Roger. Stand by.
We didn't lose too much.
Yes, but, Houston, I don't - I didn't know if I commented or not right there - right after SPS 5, but that was really some wild steering that we got on that one. I don't mean that we were out of ...
[Garble] wild.
... it wasn't out of control or anything. It is just that we sure built up some large attitude errors.
Mister Wild, you're cranked up (laughter). Your errors went out to like 3 degrees or -
Yes, really out to about 5 or 6. They went off scale.
Did they really?
Yaw went way off scale. Went off scale and kept going out off about another degree and a half.
Okay, we're 2 percent low on A, 2 percent low in C, 1-1/2 percent low in B, l-l/2 percent low in D. That's not too bad.
No, shoot, I thought you had - I thought you were I getting ...
I did it wrong.
I thought [garble] went down farther today. That's what we are with respect to the nominal.
Yes.
That's pretty good.
That screwed up the first time.
Oh.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Dave, they call out a purge in the - in the Flight Plan?
Yes, I think they do, Rusty -
If I can find it.
Nope. They haven't been putting purges in here either.
Yes, they have.
Yes, they sure did.
Do we have any of that real food left?
Yes.
What is it?
I wonder.
Ugh, ham.
Oh, boy. That ought to make you thirsty.
Boy, I wish that sounded good. I really do. Man, I wish it sounded like it -
Yes.
It just doesn't sound good. Nothing sounds good. Even the thought of food doesn't sound good.
That's too bad. It takes a miserable situation and turns it around into an almost unbearable one.
Yes.
Hey, you can do almost anything, if you're not sick. You know? You can go and go and go. You get pissed off, but - sure, but you can go.
Yes. Okay, well, we got everything done in the powerdown except the DSKY ...
Did we ever get that state vector?
... the fuel cell purge and the -
No.
I never thought it came up either -
We were in BLOCK.
Oh, we are in BLOCK when they tried to send it?
No, they didn't try to send it yet. They didn't try and send - I just said we are in BLOCK.
Oh. I guess [garble] timing.
Well, who wants to take their suit off? I'll help them.
You want to? I've had mine off first each night.
No, I beat you the first night.
Yes, you did.
It's Rusty's turn.
You going to take your suit off?
Yes, why don't we give Rusty his druthers.
Yes, I guess.
Get comfortable.
Yes, if I don't get sick getting comfortable.
Why don't you let all the rest of the powering down stuff and all that be ours, and you go get your suit off, clean up, try to eat, and go to bed?
Okay. Cleaning up sounds pretty good.
Get one of those towels and wash and ...
Yes.
... all that stuff. That'll make you feel better.
Okay. You want to watch the radio?
Yes, I'll take it.
Tell you what, Rusty. Why don't we get up here in the top and let you unsuit, pack your suit away down here, and you could just go there on the bottom of your - of your seat, fold your seat up, and sit there and clean up while Dave and I take care of all the rest of this. You'd be out of the way, and you'd be vertical and -
Okay, SUIT POWER coming OFF.
That's fine.
Dave, [garble]?
Yes. Right up in the F-1, right above your head.
Okay.
That's F-1. Go ahead and I'll put it on.
Oh, no.
Boy oh boy, are you cute!
[Garble].
You'd make a great basketball player. I hope you been trying to teach your kids.
Oh, yes.
(Laughter)
No, go get it. Let's don't stuff up anymore in - of that good stuff in -
Hey.
[Garble].
You want to hand me that stuff and I'll [garble].
What?
That [garble] stuff.
No, I can get it. Go ahead. No sweat.
I'm not doing anything [Garble].
There's nothing going on now. We're not even there wherever "there" is.
[Garble] looks like [garble] getting [garble].
I know it. Hey, you might check that screen down there where those suit circuits [garble] I cleaned it about an hour after you went over it this morning. It was filthy then.
It looked like it [garble] on it, or something on it.
Yes.
[Garble] something [garble] a lot of [garble] washing from [garble].
What?
[Garble] RCS [garble].
No. Thank you. I've got a stable position, here. Gravity gradient. I usually float up, but I'm not floating up tonight.
It's coming in on the PDA.
[Garble].
Yes.
[Garble] get past that period ...
That's right. Maybe you do overcome it. Very interesting.
Guess I'll go to bed later on.
Oh, I'll get one later, Jim. No, I've got one in my pocket. Thank you.
I'll tell you one thing, boy, that - that probe sure worked quick today. Oh boy, I couldn't believe it. I was a little afraid of the forces on putting it back in - that they had doubled. Gee, it was nothing. Less than 50 pounds all the way. Right number of strokes. Gee, it worked good. Those guys, they really ought to get a - a rose or something out there. They really did a good job.
[Garble].
Huh?
[Garble].
It's a new bunch of guys.
[Garble].
Oh, yes. They got a bunch - they got a couple of guys from LAD - He came from LAD. He was an airplane de designer. He didn't even know how to spell Apollo when he got there.
He's the guy that really did the most work on that latch. That's sort of his big project.
We haven't tried those yet - but once.
Yes.
Yes. It really looked nice.
I did notice that somebody going through caught one of those umbilical covers and popped it open. I mean that's no big deal. I just closed it. You know the little plastic ones that close down?
What? It should fold flat, Jim.
Yes, that center couch came out pretty good today, too. Yes. It's a lot easier to tell at zero g.
Really?
Oh, yes. Shoot, I'd - I had that flat done - I had the whole thing reconfigured from the time I'd - I had my helmet and gloves - I had to put helmet and gloves on. No, wait a minute - Took the couch out first. The end of the burn until I got the couch back in, and I was ready to put my helmet and gloves on - was 10 minutes from the time I started putting helmet and gloves on until I had the drogue out was 15 - which was really - That's pretty - that's pretty efficient, you know.
Yes, I rolled it up and put it down underneath there.
Sir?
Ouch! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
I think I stuck it in the front of the L-bag there, Rusty. I was in a pretty big hurry- I think. I put a bunch of stuff in there.
(Laughter) [Garble].
Find it?
Trying to figure out why we keep going the same way.
Oh, I know it.
Hey, there's a satellite. I [garble] see one. No, no, no. It's way out there, it's stable. You got to come up here and look down. You got to come up farther. And look down almost between minus Y and plus Z. [Garble] out of your way [garble] there it is.
[Garble].
See that, Dave?
[Garble].
No, there's only one! You guys saw a satellite last night. I see one tonight. That's the one.
[Garble].
A satellite! Go back to the LEB.
What?
Go back to the LEB! You don't like my little thing.
God, what is that? Oh, where'd you get it from?
Yes. Well, you know we ought to be able to ...
[Garble] stuff in there?
[Garble].
The one down there is useless - down here is all stuff. That one, I cleaned that out once this [garble].
I cleaned that out this morning. Thanks.
Hey, there's a big one. A great big one went by [garble].
Yes, this window's really getting foggy, isn't it?
That'll hold for a couple of days.
Apollo 9, Houston through Guam.
Roger, Houston; Apollo 9. Go ahead.
Roger. We're kind of standing by for S-band lockup here to get an E-memory dump from you.
Oh, very well.
And we never saw the state vector go in.
Roger. It'll be coming in there shortly, as soon as they get the lockup.
Okay. [Long pause]
Okay, Apollo 9. Looks like we got it. Request a VERB 74, and give us a Mark when you do it.
Roger. Okay here we go: 3, 2, 1.
Mark. [Long pause]
Apollo 9, Houston. While we're waiting here, we'd like to have an oral temperature from Rusty, and we recommend that he take one Maresine about an hour before his suiting tomorrow morning.
Roger. Understand. [Long pause]
Apollo 9, Houston. Request P00 and ACCEPT.
Roger have P00 and ACCEPT.
Okay. Should be coming up. We need a dosimeter readout, too, if you have those handy. [Pause]
Okay. Stand by. We can give you two out of three.
Okay. [Long pause]
Okay. The CMP is 16111.
16111. [Long pause]
CDR's is zero 3111.
03111. [Pause]
9, Houston. On the first contact we had today, they were recorded real good at the site, and evidently we had just a bit of a problem getting them back to MCC; but the COMM checks were good.
Oh, very good. Okay. What kind of heater/fan configuration would you like tonight on the CRYO.
Okay. We will give that to you over Texas; probably heaters off and we'll have the fan on. Okay...
Okay. We'll be standing by for your word.
Okay. And I've got a NAV check for you if you're ready to copy it.
Stand by. [Long pause]
Okay. Go ahead with the NAV check.
Okay. Of course, the purposes for going off the range: GET 056 30 0000, minus 3251, -00910, 1258. Over.
Roger. 056 30 0000, minus 3251, minus 00910 1258.
Roger. It's good and the computer is yours.
Oh, very well. Thank you. [Pause]
9, Houston. Another thing we came to a conclusion here was that we had to be in high bit rate for the PINGS to AGS initialization. [Pause]
Roger. Understand.
Hey, they said they had to be in HIGH BIT RATE for the PGNCS-to-AGS initialization.
Now, we're just about to LOS here. I'll give you some more dope on tomorrow's activities when we get over Hawaii.
Okay. Understand.
And he also said ...
And you might be thinking about if there's any changes in the window fogging from yesterday. [Pause]
Roger. Today.
No. Well, yes, as a matter of fact...
The left-hand rendezvous window was fogging a little more around the edges. It looks like it'll be okay for the rendezvous, but it's [garble].
- the only one of the bunch that's degrading. The rest of them still look pretty good.
By-by, Houston.
Said the PLSS COMM checks were all good. They were having trouble with the sites. They recorded them, and sent them back from the sites and they all sounded real good.
That was pretty good.
Night-night, computer.
Are you getting your oral thermometer, or temperature? Oh, isn't that cute?
Hey, you know, these books really aren't too bad the way they're set up. They're really not bad. It's where - We all got stuff to play with.
Yes. Or maybe - or maybe we're just not smart enough to be able to change it. You have - you know, roll with the punch.
Yes. And - and if somebody's passing a block update you could still be working with the other stuff. I don't think they're bad. Given 7 more days, I bet we'd think they're probably pretty good.
Hey, I don't know what to do with this thing.
You know, it -
Got to do that. I was all ready. I know it. I know it.
What is it?
Nominal, 98?
That's probably close, to nominal, isn't it? Well, see, that should convince you you're not sick. It convinced me.
I guess, if you don't have anything to eat. Oh, I'm sorry. Anybody want something?
I hate to put this camera up there without a lens on it, because I'm afraid some dirt will get in it. Huh? No, this lens doesn't fit on it - on the window. Yes, let's put it in here. Let me -
You know, I was going to take a picture after you dock [garble] burn. No, you had the lens. There wasn't anything to take a picture of anyway.
Yes, I never saw a plume either, and I looked hard.
Oh, Yes.
Here you go, Rusty.
Oh yes, well -
Here's a power cable you can stick in there, Jim.
Yes, they sure are.
Oh, I always thought that was a pretty good idea.
Apollo 9, Houston through Hawaii.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 9.
Okay. I missed your comment on the windows there as you went over the hill.
Okay. The windows are looking pretty good. All of them are just fine as a matter of fact, except the left-hand rendezvous window. And the film that we had yesterday is continuing to grow, the little light band around the edges. It'll be fine for the rendezvous but interesting to see how long it lasts on into the 10 days. Let's see, only one of the bunch, really, that looks like it has a problem. The little circle that was in the center of the hatch window hasn't seemed to grow any. And the rest of them are remaining about the same, pretty good.
Okay.
And temperature is about 98.6.
Roger. 98.6. Okay. I've got a few comments on tomorrow's time lines if you're ready to copy and listen, there, I guess. [Pause]
Okay. Just a second.
Okay. Basically what we've planned is to stay on the normal timeline for both vehicles up to the point of going EVA. And when we got into the PLSS things there, we'll go through the normal PLSS hookup, but stay on the LM ECS hoses in suit disconnect from the LM, instead of connecting the OPS. [Pause]
Okay.
Okay. We want to keep the TV pass as scheduled, and it's kind of dealer's choice there, shots inside the LM, tunnel, or whatever you want.
Okay.
Okay. Do you have any druthers on the PLSS COMM? We were thinking that maybe you - going ahead and use the LM relay mode.
All right. Stand by.
9, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Houston, 9. Go ahead.
Roger. We're curious. Did Rusty take a Marezine and a Lomotil this morning? [Pause]
That's affirmative.
Roger. [Pause]
We're massaging your plan right now.
Okay. [Pause]
9, this is Deke. How do you read?
Say again.
Deke here. How do you read?
Stand by one, Deke.
Okay. [Long pause]
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. I think we had LOS on you before we finished our last transmission. I thought I'd let you know that everybody down here is very happy with the way the day has gone and I'd like to congratulate you for an outstanding job.
Thank you.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. I think we might add a little bit to what we were saying about tomorrow, and that is that we intend to just have the hatch open only during the first daylight pass and then button it up.
Roger. Fading out. We haven't got a solid lock I don't think, yet. Would you say it once more, please?
Okay. How are we now?
Okay, I think you're coming in better now.
I might add that we plan to have the hatch open only during the first daylight pass and then button it up rather than going all the way around with the hatch open.
Roger. Yes, I'd like to finish up tomorrow's activities a little earlier, if we can.
We understand that.
Okay. We only have a 7 and a half hour rest period tomorrow night, and I want to make sure that we have enough time to configure the spacecraft for the transfer the next day and still get some sleep.
Concur.
It looks like we're going to have to open the hatch at normal time, leave it open for that daylight pass, close it, configure it for the TV, and when the TV is over then we would leave the LM, come back in the command module. Is that right?
That's right, and as a matter of fact, we don't even want the TV to interrupt the transfer. If possible you can, you know, start the transfer early.
Oh, okay. I see what you're - You're saying that we plan to follow normal time line and when we get to the time to open the hatch, as we do that, leave them open during the first daylight pass, close them up, and then we egress the LM, and tune in the TV on the way out, sort of.
Something like that, yes.
Yes, that sounds like a pretty reasonable plan.
And, 9, Houston. While we've got a little bit of COMM here, I've got some block data number 7 for you.
Okay. We'll whip up the pad here. One thing that we - you might take under advisement is be prepared for us to be a little bit late in the morning because it's really a scramble trying to get suited, and once you get suited you become all tangled up in these hoses, so we have to take a little - It takes a bit longer, I guess, in the morning than we really have allotted in the Flight Plan. So we may be just a little late getting over there.
Okay. we understand.
I think ones we get to the LM, we find that we worked that through enough and there's not that much jumping around that requires to take too much longer than normal.
Okay.
Okay. Go ahead with your block data. [Pause]
Houston, go ahead with the block data. We're ready.
9, Houston. One more thing here. We plan to turn H2 tank 1 fan on at 56 plus 00.
Say again the time, please.
At 56 plus 00.
H2 fan 1 on at 56 plus 00.
Roger. And how about S-band volume up at 56 plus 22. We'll try an S-band ARIA pass. [Pause]
Okay, S-band volume 56 plus 22. [Pause]
Okay. Now we're ready for block data.
Okay. Go ahead.
Area 039 3 Alpha, plus 273, plus 1450 061 35 08 4355; 040 Alpha Charlie, minus 091, minus 0120 062 29 34 4355; 041 Alpha Charlie, minus 008, minus 0230 064 02 26 4355; 042 Alpha Charlie, plus 090, minus 0320 065 35 55 4355. Still with me, 9? [Pause]
Roger. Press on.
043 2 Alpha, plus 247, minus 0270 067 12 51 4355; 044 Alpha Charlie, plus 313 0 - belay that - minus 0290 068 46 52 4355. And 9, your SPS trims: pitch, minus 0.9; yaw, minus 1.1. Houston, over. [Pause]
Roger. I didn't know Retro had so many areas.
Yes. He's got a batch of them.
Okay. I guess we start at 039 3 Alpha, right? [Pause]
Affirmative
Plus 273, plus 1450, 061 35 08 4355; 040 Alpha Charlie, minus 091, minus 0120 062 29 34 4355; 041 Alpha Charlie, minus 008, minus 230 064 02 26 4355; 042 Alpha Charlie, plus 090, minus 0320 065 35 55 4355; 043 2 Alpha, plus 247, minus 0270 067 12 51 4355; 044 Alpha Charley, plus 313, minus 0290 068 46 52 4355.
9, Houston. Your readback is correct. And request you verify a CO2 canister change there a while back.
That's verified, on time.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Houston, here.
Do you have any good information on why our rendezvous radar data wasn't getting into the computer?
We've got the bigheads moving it over down here, and we haven't come up with a real good answer yet.
Okay. Did you get any good downlink data from those checks that we did?
Say, again.
Did you get any downlink data from the rendezvous radar checks that we did?
That's affirmative. We did get some data.
Okay. So you have the data to look at, too.
Yes.
Okay. We'll be standing by anxiously to find out what your conclusion is.
Okay. And the computer is yours; you can go to BLOCK on the computer.
Okay. And it's already put to bed. [Pause]
Say, Houston. Say, we've got H2 heaters OFF now and O2 heaters on.
Say again, Dave. [Long pause]
Apollo 9, Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo 9, Houston.
Roger. We are VHF at this time. I tried you on S-band. Did you hear me at all?
Negative, we didn't hear you on S-band, and I've got it turned up.
Okay. Evidently the S-band didn't work. Let's go ahead and keep the VHF here. We will try S-band at the end of the pass again. Got some good dope for you on the rendezvous radar DSKY test.
Standby a minute. [Long pause]
Okay Houston, go ahead.
Roger. The downlink shows that the rendezvous radar self test is okay, and in checking it out a little bit more, the self-test doesn't show up on the DSKY because the antenna is in the stowed position. [Pause]
Okay. Understand Houston. Downlink shows that the RR self-test is okay, and the reason that it didn't show up on the DSKY was because it was in the STOWED position.
That is affirmative. We ginned up a procedure so that you could look at it on a DSKY. However, since it was good on the downlink, rather than mess around with a new procedure, we will probably go ahead - we'd like to go ahead and say it works, and try it out on rendezvous day.
Stand by one, Houston.
Houston, GO.
Standby Houston. [Long pause]
Houston, 9.
Houston, GO.
Okay. How about whipping those procedures into reasonable form? And, if there is time tomorrow, I guess we would like to look at that, and perhaps even stowe it - just to get the feeling onboard. Okay?
Okay. We can do that for you; and we will have it for you tomorrow.
Okay. Very well, thank you. [Pause]
Okay. That was the USB we're talking on here. It looks like we are about LOS, and talk is not too good over Tananarive. So, if you don't hear from us, have a good night's sleep.
Okay. Thank you very much. We'll see you in the morning.
Roger.
