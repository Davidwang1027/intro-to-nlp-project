We show ignition on the S-IVB.
It's on the way.
It's just like a bright star disappearing into the distance.
Is there quite a bit of debris kicked out there, Apollo 9?
Looked like a real clean burn.
You could see a lot of stuff coming out when he just started up, but then it just went into a nice bright light.
Beautiful!
We got some movies, but I'm not sure they're going to be too good.
And the S-IVB has shut down, Apollo 9?
Roger. He's just a speck in the distance right now.
Okay. Now that we've got him out of the way, back with the business at hand. I'm ready to read SPS-1 PAD any time.
Okay. Stand by just a minute.
Apollo 9, this is Houston. Could we have P00 and Accept? We'd like to start you up a target load.
Roger. You got it.
Understand. We got it.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. Ready to copy the P30.
Roger. Starting with the P30, and there will be about a minute delay on the target load. We're going to switch stations. Starting now on the maneuver PAD. SPS-1, 005:59 all zips, plus 0036.8 all zips, all zips, 0036.8 0032.4 0:05.1 58840, plus 1.00 minus 0.20 17 13.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go, Apollo 9.
Go, Apollo 9.
Roger. You cut out very badly in that. I got Tig and I got ΔVx and ΔVr and ΔVc and that's all I got.
Okay. We'll try you again, Now are you reading me, okay?
Roger. Reading you okay now. Stand by just a minute.
Okay. Go ahead again.
Say again, Apollo 9.
Roger. Go ahead with your PAD.
Okay, I won't read the Tig again. That's 5:59:00, and reading the ΔVx, plus 0036.8, and are you with me?
Yes I am, and that's as far as we got last time.
Okay. All zeros for ΔVy, all zeros 0036.8 0032.4 0:05.1 58840, plus 1.00, minus 0.20 17 135.20 33.100.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go, Apollo 9.
Roger. The last thing I got was 58840; you got any more?
Roger. We'll try you again here. Stand by one here.
Okay. Apollo 9, Houston. How do you read?
Reading you five-square, Houston.
Okay. You're coming in a little weak. Understand you got up through CSM weight; is that affirmative?
That'a affirmative.
Okay. Reading Pitch Trim: plus 1.00, minus 0.20 17 135.20 33.100. End of the PAD.
Roger. Readback: 005:59 all zips, plus 0036.8 all zips all zips 0036.8 0032.4 0:05.1 58840, plus 1.00, minus 0.20 17 135.20 33.100.
Houston confirms the PAD. I would also now like to give you your gimbal angles used in the PAD REFSMMAT for SPS-1.
Go.
Roger. It's roll 00, pitch 359, yaw 001.
Roger. Understand, 000 359 001.
And this is affirmative; Houston confirms.
Roger.
And is the computer ours? Did you get the P27 in?
The computer is yours, Apollo 9.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 9, this is Houston through Ascension.
Roger, Houston. This is Apollo 9. Reading you loud and clear.
Roger, Apollo 9. We'd like to update your state vector again, if you could give us P00 and Accept.
Roger. You have P00 and Accept.
Roger. And a couple of items: There is a bias in your X- PIPA, and we are taking a look at this. The only steps we would like to do at this time would be to recommend that you stay in average G as little time as possible. We are estimating that during the SPS-1 burn, there will be an error of about a foot and a half, and so the only thing we will do at this time is you just come out of average G as soon as possible, and we will talk about this later after the burn.
Okay. And we have another problem here. Our O2 flow high light continues to come on and we seem to have a steady-state flow around 7-8/10 pounds per hour. We don't have the vent open yet - the waste management vent, but we do have the LM pressurization on, and I'm wondering if you could give us a clue as to whether you think we have a leaky LM or what.
Roger. We copied the transmission, Apollo 9. And stand by for some words of wisdom on that.
We're getting the Master Alarm light on every few minutes here, either from the hydrogen-cryo or the O2 flow high. It is almost like the simulator.
Roger. That is a shame.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We'd like to have the fans in H2 tank 1 turned on manually at this time, and just leave it on. We will leave it on for a while and take a look at it.
Okay. Very good. We'll turn the fan on.
Okay, And we would like to know if you can see the docking angle index when you were up in the tunnel.
Negative. I didn't look.
Okay.
Apollo 9, this is Houston. The computer is yours and I have a state vector - I mean a nav check to go along with that state vector.
Roger. Stand by.
Okay, Houston. Ready to copy your nav check.
Roger. Disregard, Apollo 9. We have checked it here on the ground.
Apollo 9, did you copy?
(garbled) Houston. We won't need it.
Okay. We won't read it. We are going to have you for about another minute at Ascension and then we will see you over Tananarive at 19.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We would like to have you turn off the LM pressurization valve to see if that takes care of the O2 high flow.
Roger. We will catch that in a few minutes and advise you.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We want you to go back to P30 - P40 again to recompute that REFSMMAT after this uplink.
Hello, Apollo 9, this is Houston through Tananarive.
Apollo 9, this is Houston. If you read me, we'll see you over Carnarvon at around 32.
Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon.
Roger, Houston.
We're reading you loud and clear.
(garbled) angles if you are ready to copy.
Go ahead.
(garbled) GET 05:18:30, plus 00.153, plus 00.333, minus 00.638.
Roger, Apollo 9. I copy that.
Roger.
Apollo 9, this is Houston. You are go SPS-1.
Roger, Houston (garbled). Go for SPS-1.
And, Apollo 9, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 9. Go ahead.
Roger. Just a word of info to close out that item on the power going into the LM. That duty cycle has now settled down and is exactly the same as the duty cycle was prior to launch. So everything is good im the LM power. And it's 5 on and 28 off.
Real fine. Thank you.
Roger.
Apollo 9, this is Houston through Guam. Standing by.
Roger, Houston. We're rushing through a checklist here.
Apollo 9, Houston, I will have you here for about another 2½ minutes, and I have got a couple of words of wisdom on your attitude on this burn - why you are going to be off a couple of degrees in pitch and a couple of degrees in yaw if you want me to give them to you.
Go ahead.
Okay. Your REFSMMAT is off slightly and we think this may have come about by the order in which you loaded the DAP in relation to the P52. However, we have taken a look at this and we are saying at burn attitude you are going to have zero roll, a pitch of 358, and a yaw of about 002, and this will give you the right burn. It's just you won't be at 000 on the ball.
Roger, Houston. Thank you very much.
Roger.
Houston, this is Apollo 9.
Go, Apollo 9.
We seem to have our O2 thing in hand now. We have closed the tunnel thing and we also (garbled) suit (garbled) valve, and one of us had our helmet off for just a moment there and that was contributing to it, too. So it looks like we have the O2 problem in hand.
Roger. We copy that. Some of it was dropped out. I am about to lose you here. We will see you over Hawaii at 57.
And, Apollo 9, this is Houston. Standing by for your burn.
Roger, Houston. Apollo 9. A minute 10 seconds, ready to go.
Roger.
Alright, 5.1 seconds. I've got the clock.
Stand by for 30 seconds. Is that right?
Right.
Did you null ullage?
Yes, null ullage. Just like the simulator. Delta-V to Auto; EMS to Auto. Average G.
Man, look at it count.
0.4? That's alright.
Alright for a Proceed, Jimmy?
Okay for a Proceed.
Okay.
99. Proceed. 2, 1 -
3, 2, 1 -
Shutdown. Okay. Engine's shut off. The LM is still there, by God!
Okay -
Okay, I want --
to get the Delta-V thrust, off.
Delta thrust, off.
Okay. Verify all thrust-off cubes. Gimbal motors, four, to off, one at a time.
Okay. Pitch 1, off.
Verify.
Pitch 2, off.
Verify.
Yaw 1, off.
Verify.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. I copy your residuals: plus 1.8, plus 0.5, minus 0.2.
Roger. That's affirmative. And the EMS was minus 4.2.
Roger. Minus 4.2.
Apollo 9, Houston. In about 30 seconds we'll lose you off Hawaii and have you back at Redstone about a minute later. There will be a break in there, and then we'll pick you up for a long pass.
Apollo 9, this is Houston through Redstone. We ought to have you now on a long stateside pass.
Apollo 9, Houston through Redatone. How do you read?
Houston, Apollo 9. How do you read?
You're down a little bit, Dave, but I'm reading you okay. We've got you through the Redstone now, and it should be a nice long pass.
Houston, Apollo 9. You are unreadable.
Roger. You're about the same. Stand by one here. I think we'll get better here in a couple of minutes.
Apollo 9, this is Houston. How do you read now?
Apollo 9, this is Houston. Trying again; how do you read?
Apollo 9, Houston. Do you read?
Apollo 9, Houston through Texas. How do you read?
Roger. Houston, Apollo 9, We read you loud and clear. How about us?
We're reading you five-square, We just sent the S-IVB hyperbolic and got it out of your way.
Very good. We were reading you all along there. I guess you just weren't reading us.
Roger. Guess we had some of our receivers turned in on the S-IVB there, that I didn't know they had taken away from me.
Okay.
When you get squared away after the burn, I've got your star count update for you.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. Go ahead with the update.
Roger. Star count update: 006:49:45.00 068 - 068.0 if you want the decimal there - 291.1 330.2. End of update.
Roger, Understand. 006:49:45.00 068.0 291.1 330.2.
That's affirmative. Houston confirms the update and would like to have you go ahead and open up the LM pressurization valve, if you concur.
Roger. We tried to get a hold of you before to tell you we're going to do it, so we'll open it up at this time.
Okay.
Hoston, Apollo 9.
Go, Apollo 9.
How are we making out on RCS as opposed to manual? What I'm wondering about is whether or not we should do the star count.
Roger. Stand by one.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We're down a little bit, but we're got an excellent margin, and nobody is sweating it at all, Jim. We recommend that you go ahead and do this star check.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go, Houston.
Let me give you an up on the SPS PU system there. Following the burn, I'm reading 89.2 percent in oxidizer and 93.7 in fuel and an unbalanced pegged on the decreased side.
Roger. Copy 89.2, 93.7, and the unbalanced pegged on the decreased side.
Roger. And for your information, the feed vent, SPS injector valve A-1 opens slower than A-2.
Roger. Copy. A-1 is slower than A-2.
