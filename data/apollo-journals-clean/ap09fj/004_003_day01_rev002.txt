Apollo 9, this is Houston through Bermuda.
Roger. Houston through Bermuda. Go ahead.
Roger. We'd like to uplink you a state vector there, Apollo 9. We - there is a discrepancy between your vector and ours. We don't have a real good story for you at this time. It was sort of a slow diversion trend, but we would like to slip it in. There were some funnies about the lift-off time, and everything that we're working on, but at this time we'd like to give you a new vector.
Okay. Understand you want to give us a new vector on the - let me see - stand by.
Roger. P00 and Accept. You got it.
Roger. We'll go to work on it. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go, Apollo 9.
Roger. I checked the O2 purge before I noticed I didn't check the H2, so I got the purge heater on for awhile, and I'm gonna check the H2 purge. Might be seeing that.
Roger. You're going to be checking H2 purge; and Apollo 9, I have a nav check to go along with this state vector when you are ready to copy.
Roger. Stand by on the purge, and stand by on the nav check.
Roger. At your convenience.
And,
Roger, Thank you.
And ready to copy on the nav.
Roger. Reading the nav check. Time: 002:29 all zeros, -30.81, +116.22, 106.7. End of update.
Roger. Readback: 002:29 all zips, -30.81, +116.22, 106.7.
Roger. Houston confirms the update.
Okay.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. We copy your DSKY on the ground.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Just for your info here, we'll be sending a command into the IU just to verify our response, and this will have no effect on you. We are just trying to troubleshoot our LVDC data, and we don't want you to move the IU Accept switch; leave it in Block.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go, Apollo 9.
Roger, Houston. Apollo 9. Do you - We're about ready to terminate our cabin purge. Is that okay with you?
Stand by one, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, this is Houston. We concur. Go ahead and terminate.
Okay.
Didn't work.
Roger. Copy.
(garbled) That's the first of many times.
Yes, but - all welcome.
S-IV LM - S-IVB/LM SEP, two, are both closed.
Verified.
Okay, CB Docking Probe (2), Closed.
Okay. CB Docking Probe (2), Closed.
Docking Probe Extend/Release, Extend/Release until barber pole.
Okay. I'm going to call Houston and tell them we're doing that.
Houston, this is Apollo 9.
Go, Apollo 9.
We're ready to extend the docking probe. Are you ready.
Oh boy, we are all ears down here. Please let us hear how that goes.
Okay. Fine. It's in work.
Okay, --
Extend/Release switch to Extend/Release until barber pole. Whooee! Would you believe it went --
Yes. Docking probe Extend/Release --
Gray, at full extend. I'd say that was three tenths of a second again, Dave.
Yes.
Roger. It was just like the chamber; we heard it go out, and it took a couple or three tenths of a second.
Then Release until talkback?
Roger. Copy.
Okay.
Then note Docking probe talkback gray at full extension.
Okay, talk --
Hey, who's reading this thing?
Me.
You want to take my job?
I will in a minute, yes.
Docking probe Extend/Release to Retract; talkback, gray.
Retract; talkback is gray.
COAS mounted.
Okay.
COAS Power - On.
COAS Power's coming on.
Verify RCS DAP loaded.
I'll tell you what. Why don't you start putting our helmets and - Oh, they're down here a step.
Yes.
Okay, Rusty.
I think I ought to go put mine on.
And, Apollo 9, this is Houston. We'll fall off at Canaries here in about another minute and we'll see you over Tananarive around 09.
Roger. Tananarive at 09.
Okay, you want to load the RCS DAP, Dave?
Alright.
11102.
Okay.
Okay, and R2, all ones.
Okay. 11102 and 11111?
Okay, and I guess you Proceed out of there.
Yes.
Okay, load Noun 17.
Okay.
Boy, I wish I had a towel (garbled) --
Okay.
18143.
You didn't run across a towel or anything down there, did you?
A what, Jim?
A towel?
They're up underneath me.
(garbled) clean off my visor.
They're up underneath me. Lay up at A-1, Jimmy.
A long ways up there.
09436.
Okay. 01478.
Looks good. 183.43, 94.36, 14.78.

Yes, yes.
Okay.
Okay, Noun 22.
Okay.
121.43.
Okay.
274.36.
Okay.
Oh, Davey, you didn't get me the helmet visor cover.
Yes. It's un - it's in the L-1, Jim.
L-1, what's that?
No - it's in the L-shaped bag, I'm sorry.
L-shaped bag, okay.
345.22.
Okay.
I'll go get that.
Let me check that: 121.43, 274.36, 345.22. That looks good.
Set the docking attitude on attitude set dials.
Alright.
121.4.
Where did you say those towels were, Dave?
The towels? I think they're underneath me in A-1, way up here.
Oh, isn't it pretty out? Whoo hoo! Look at those thunderstorms.
What am I hooked on up there? (garbled) hanging over.
121.4; Dave, you got that?
Coming up. Okay. 121.4, okay?
274.4.
Alright. A little longer.
See if I can see a star in the daytime now.
274.4, wasn't it?
Right, and 345.2.
345.2, okay.
Okay, that's it. Sep preparation now. S-IVB attitude, deadband, and H2 vent rate, confirmed by MSFN.
Got to align the GDC - Did we get that again? Yes, we did.
Jim, while you're down there, how about Waste Stowage Vent - Closed.
I got that.
Suit Circuit Return valve - Close.
Okay, just a minute.
Wait a minute now. I guess we've got to don our helmets and gloves first before we do that one.
Yes.
There he is, right there.
It's - getting dark again.
Does that every few minutes. Okay, I think I'll put my helmet and gloves on and then put that on. Ouch!
I got a few spots on my window, but I don't see much gunk.
(Singing)
(Laughter)
There it is. It's getting dark.
It sure is, isn't it?
Yes. Oh, there's lightning. Look at all that lightning on the horizon.
Now you can see stars, Rusty. See the stars?
Let me look. I got my lights up awful bright.
Tell you one thing I'm going to have is some navigation here with this medal. Let me get this thing out of there.
No, I don't yet. Oh, let me get my checklist out of the way.
Got one right at 12 o'clock.
Do we really?
Yes.
Oh, yes. Yes, I see it. Yes, about three degrees above the horizon?
Why don't you start getting your helmets on so we can get -
Ahh, what a drag!
(garbled)
Okay. Just a second; I'm trapped. Oh boy!
Okay, it's turnover time. Slowly I turn. (Singing)
Here, I have a rag here if you can use it.
Oh, that's okay. I'm - I'm sure I didn't get it enough to even notice.
Jim, the bags go in A-5, which is the CO2 canister right down --
to the right of the --
Okay.
I'll be right with you.
Okay, one each, helmet, on (garbled) tied down. Oh, that was a brilliant one!
By the time I get it out, I won't need it; my helmet will already be bashed up. Oh, shoot. Crash, bang! Where did we get this thing?
Am I in your way, Jim?
No, no.
Okay.
Okay, I got the helmet on.
Oh, I got a foggy helmet.
Do you?
Whooee! Sure is.
How come, is it foggy already?
I don't know, but it's really fogging.
You got your flow on?
Yes. Helmet, too.
Hey, what's the suit-inlet temperature? I feel kind of warm.
Suit inlet is 47°.
Hmm!
Here, they go down here in A-5, huh?
Yes.
Mmm.
Ahh, there goes a hair. By the time this flight's over, I'm not going to have any hairs left on my forearm; I'll say that.
Wow, how do you ever get these things in here? All three of them went in there, Dave.
Yes, there - should be EVA gloves on the left. You ought to be able to get them all in there, Jim.
Tell you what; rather than fool around with that, I think I'll just stick them down here in the - Well, maybe I better not.
Put them in a temporary - F-1 or F-2 up near the temporary (garbled)
Yes.
Get them out again soon anyway.
Here's mine.
Okay, I'll be with you in just a minute.
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were done.
No, not quite. Not quite.
Okay, I'll take it.
Now, let me get that. Okay, I got that one. Ouch! Boy, I got a real hair in there.
Where's your bag, Rusty, or don't you need me to stow it?
It's - it's up at the head there. I think it's okay.
Okay, good.
I guess I ought to get that dark slide off there; it's liable to smack me in the chops. Oh, we're not going to thrust, are we, yet?
Sure. Is that noticeably tighter?
Yes, that's as tight as they go. Okay, that's better. That's good.
Okay, now I've got to get yours.
Okay, so I can (garbled)
What?
Guess what's missing?
What?
A Hasselblad camera.
Oh, no.
What do you mean, it's missing? (Laughter)
Okay.
So, it's got to be floating around somewhere in the cabin.
Damn!
There it is, down there.
You got it?
Yes. I see it; I haven't got it.
Okay.
Dave, let me see if I can read you something here.
Okay.
Emergency Cabin Pressure to Off; no, Dave - Jim's got to do that.
Let me - let me go ahead and get those. Here's your camera.
Where? Okay.
Emergency Cabin Pressurization's off.
No, stand by here; I - I'm screwed up. Suit Circuit Return valve - Closed.
Okay. Yo - Everybody in their suit okay?
Everybody's in their suit. Emergency Cabin Pressure to Test, and Press until cabin reaches 5.7, and I'll let you know.
I can't get that son of a bitch closed.
You want me to?
There, it's closed. Boy, that's a bitch, isn't it, Jim?
Yes, really it's - it's tough to move; you - you're such a -
Well, not really. Let me try to get done here.
Oh.
Boy, am I messing up my helmet!
What are you doing?
Putting my face helmet --
Okay, Emergency Cabin Pressure - Press to test going now.
Okay. And we'll probably get an O2 Flow High warning.
How we doing?
We are 5.0 something.
Okay, the warning's going to come on in a second here.
We're not even to 5.1 yet, Jim.
Oh.
We got a long way to go.
How did the surge tank go?
Surge tank is 8 - 820 or so. Okay, we're 5.25; surge tank is now 800. 5.4; surge tank is 780. Now we're about 5.5; surge tank, 760. And 5.6 almost, and the surge tank is 720. And we're about 5.7

Okay.
FDAI 1 - Inertial.
Now wait a minute, Rusty. Let me finish aligning the GDC first.
Yes, sir.
Okay. I was behind; fixed in a minute.
I'm sorry.
Boy, you center these three hoses and --
Roger, Houston. You're 5 square.
What's that?
Oh, gunk.
Okay, you ready, Dave?
No.
Okay.
Oh, you know what I needed on this damned camera was a handle.
It's too late now.
Shoot, yes.
I can't keep my bloody nose off of that thing.
Tananarive, Houston, NET 1.
Houston, Tananarive,
That's affirmative,
Okay, GDC is aligned.

Houston, you read Apollo 9?
345.2 and 274 what?
274.4 on the middle --
Oh, shoot. You know what I forgot?
What?
So clever! Just a smartass!
No sunglasses, huh?
Yes.
Oh, me too, damn it!
Son of a gun! You want mine, Dave?
I got mine handy.
Hey, you want to take your helmet off, and put it on?
Yes. I guess I will.
Okay, I'll stop reading the checklist here.
Just a second now, I'll loosen up - I'll shut your suit flow off so you can get your helmet back on.
Now wait a minute. I don't need to do that, Jim. I can pop a glove and do it. Yes, it's easier to pop a glove.
Alright.
I tell you, this damned camera won't stay anywhere. Let me try it Velcro on the back, there. Okay, camera, stay there now. Yes, I'm going to pop a glove and put mine on, too.
Jim, could you hang on to these things for me for a minute? I have a -
What's the flow at?
O2 flow high.
Wonder wha - oh - wonder why that is.
Oh, Dave took his helmet off.
Yes, me too. Does that make a difference?
Yes.
Back a little farther. Okay, that's it. Here you go. How you doing?
Okay, I'm - I'm about to take my helmet off here, so --
We're all the way down to the bottom, Jim.

Just - I'm doing ORDEAL.
He's ad - he's adjusting ORDEAL.
Okay.
Okay, back to P00.
Okay, in P00, and then MANUAL ATTITUDE, three, RATE COMMAND.

Roger, Houston; Carnarvon at 26.
And, Apollo 9, that will be Carnarvon at 26.
Roger, Houston; Apollo 9. Carnarvon at 26.

Okay, you want to wait there?
Yes.
Okay.
We've got 9 minutes.
02:34 is the maneuver.
Okay, well - well, Carnarvon's at 26; that's what I was looking at.
Yes.
Get in that pocket, you stupid thing.
I was thinking it was time to dark adapt, but that's probably the worst thing we could do.
Dark adapt with your sunglasses on, huh?
Yes. I will turn it down a little bit and see what it looks like out there, though. Oh, isn't that a pretty Earth?
See if you can see those - S-IVB thrusters firing.
I've seen some light out the side window. I never was really sure whether it was the S-IVB thrusters or --
That COAS sure looks like we rolled. I guess it's just me.
Hey, how does our horizon look out there, Dave? Can you see it alright?
Yes. The COAS looks like we're in a roll. Did you notice that, Jim?
No, I didn't. I just turned on to see what it looked like.
Which way am I? I'm - I'm looking north out my window, aren't I?
I wonder if just the way I am in the seat -
Did it - did it look straight when you checked it out?
No, I said you look straight. No, I did - all I did was turn it on to see if the light lit, Dave.
Looks level to me, Dave.
No, I didn't mean the reticle.
I know. Oh, I see.
If - if - if I look - it just doesn't.
Yes, I know what you're saying.
I'll check on the horizon when we come up there.
Okay, Rusty, you read the checklist down through DET STARTUP, and then I'll read it from there on over to a --
I'm still trying to figure out what I'm going to do with mine, too. I pulled up my suit --
Hey, how about that? You want to try sticking it up there?
Where's that? Under there?
But the hand - Hey, the hand controller is going to be in your way.
Yes, I have a hard time getting my arm over there without banging something --
Maybe I can; I'll try it.
All the RCS look good, Jimmy?
Looks good. Quad C is really down there.
Looks like a good spot, Jim.
Okay.
Let me just check my Hasselblad, and make sure it's ready to go --
Okay.
Okay. The dark slide is out. We don't have a filter on it. I thought we were supposed to have a haze filter on it.
Yes, we were.
We got the film - ASA --
Yes, that's what I thought.
Are you checking these things off, I mean sort of making a line by them or something, Rusty, when you go through them to make sure we get them all?
I can, Dave; I haven't been.
What's that? The checklist, Dave?
Yes. Since it's sort of a one-time checklist - I think we sort of stop in the middle. Oh, I don't care; just so we get them all.
Yes.
When we get over Carnarvon, you're going to have to go ahead and get a go for arming the pyros.
Um hum. Okay, the camera looks like it's ready to go.
Okay, when we --
Okay.
Which one is the clock?
The next one.
This one?
No.
Okay, 3½ minutes to Carnarvon.
The one that says RE - that says START.
I can't see it.
Okay, it's the third one from the right. You got it?
Yes.
Okay.
Hey, you want to read down those again?
Guess I'm not sure what we are going to do. I'm going to go: 3, 2, 1; I'll start thrusting at 1; hit the button at Mark; and then you start the clock.
I'm going to start the clock.
I'll go - 1001, 1002, 1003; come off of it; come back up here 15 seconds. Prior to 15 seconds, I'll go: SCS ACCELERATION COMMAND on PITCH.
Alright.
Start the PITCH around -
Right. And - coming around, I'll stop it.
FDAI Scale (garbled) 5/5 INERTIAL (garbled)
Good.
Cabin pressure is 5.8 or so.
Let's see here. You know your rates?
Alright, (garbled) I pitch down, and when I get the DAP rate back, RATE COMMAND, CMC, then stop it, MINIMUM IMPULSE, roll it, and (garbled) to get us lined up.
Okay.
And (garbled) translation from CMC. And when we get in - 50 feet or so, we lock it up with the SCS and drive it in.
Okay, real good.
And when we get there, CMC, and lock it up (garbled) If it gets out of hand, you're going to (garbled) rates in it? If that's okay, you're going to (garbled)
Apollo 9, this is Houston through Carnarvon.
Roger, Houston. We're here.
Roger. We read you loud and clear, We would like to have the up-telemetry IU switched to accept.
Go for the pyro arm anytime you want to run through it.
Roger. We want to take a look at you, and we will give you a go on that shortly. We would like to have you go ahead and arm the logic at this time.
Roger.
And would you confirm up-telemetry; are you enabled?
Negative. Up-telemetry IU is in block. Do you want to go to up-telemetry IU in accept?
That is affirmative. We would like to have the up-telemetry IU to accept.
In accept.
Understand.
Roger.
And, Apollo 9, this is Houston. We would like to have you have the up-telemetry IU switched to block.
Up-telemetry IU to block.
Very good. Thank you.
And, Houston, the logic on my mark, 3, 2, 1.
Mark!
Two logic.
Roger. We copy. Stand by one.
Apollo 9; this is Houston. You are go for pyro arm.
Roger. Understand, go for pyro arm. Thank you.
That is affirmative.
Apollo 9, this is Houston. You are go for TD&E.
Roger. Understand, go for TD&E.
Houston, what time do we come into daylight?
Do you mean on this pass or for the ejection pass?
This pass.
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. You will come into daylight on this one at about 02 plus 39 plus 21.
Roger. Thank you.
Here I was all primed for your ejection sunrise time. You faked me out on this one.
Next time I'll ask.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go, Apollo 9.
We have a rather consistent behavior on this number 1 H2 tank. It appears to light the cryo warning light every time it gets down there before the heater comes on. You might start thinking about how we're going to handle that for the sleep period because it keeps setting off the master alarm.
Roger, Apollo 9. Copy. And that is in work.
Okay. Thank you.
And, Apollo 9, this it Houston. We will go right on through an ARIA as soon as we come up off of Carnarvon on this one in about 20 seconds.
What's that? (Machine gun-like noises)
What's the pitch attitude, Dave?
(garbled)
Apollo 9, this is Houston through an honest-to-goodness ARIA. How do you read?
Ah-wah-wah-wah-wah! I got it?
Roger on the wah-wah's, Apollo 9.
Okay, we're reading you then.
Houston, according to all calculations, our S-IVB ought to start maneuvering in about 6 or 8 seconds.
There it goes.
(garbled) look at this.
Oh, boy, look at that spacecraft go.
I can see the - the stars in the Big Dipper here.
(garbled) now and the (garbled)
Houston, we're just about there.
We've made it.
Oh, we did?
Yes.
Let's wait until we get good daylight before we do (garbled)
That looks pretty (garbled)
Yes.
Isn't that something?
Hello.
Apollo 9, this is Houston. Did you call?
Huntsville AOS.
S-band looks great (garbled) Let's see how wild it is. (garbled)
Okay.
Huntsville valid two-way lock.
(garbled) get Hawaii next (garbled) that thing seems to be spurious. Well, what do you say?
Alright. It's about that time.
Okay. Verb 37, Enter; 47, Enter.

Okay. Okay, now we want to go - the THC to plus X and hold; CSM/LV pushbutton, hold, and release; and the LV tanks go to Low, and start the DET up from zero. Okay, is everybody ready --
Oh, okay, go ahead.
Okay. 3, 2, 1 - Bang! It's gone.
4 seconds and release it.
Okay.
That's 100.8. Dave, you have anything (garbled) --
Okay, we got that?
Yes, sir.
You got the 5 and 5?
(garbled)
Yes.
Man, look at that son of a gun go!
Okay, Dave, (garbled) is just beautiful. Just halfway around. Okay, just right there, Davey. Just leave it like it is (garbled) nice and bright there.
Okay.
Right there (garbled) Not too bright at all.
That help?
Yes.
Is the camera running?
Turn it on!
Okay.
Okay, (garbled) right in the right place there.
Isn't it!
Right there.
When you get that, you want to get Manual Attitude Pitch, to Rate Command.
That's good. Okay, now.
Spacecraft Control, CMC.
Okay. You look good, Jim.
Good. Null your translation and your rates.
Think they've nulled.
Okay, fine.
I'm going SCS, Minimum Impulse.
SCS, MINMUM IMPULSE. That a boy. (garbled)
What's the matter?
Well, our pitch angle isn't exactly right - it doesn't look right.
Okay.
That's alright; we're going to fly around a little bit, Dave.
Alright.
Okay. I want you to roll left 60 (garbled) Spacecraft Control to CMC and (garbled) Rate Command.
I'll talk to Houston here.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go, Apollo 9. This is Houston.
Roger. It's out there, and we're turned around and proceeding with the station-keeping and docking.
Tremendous, Apollo 9. Thank you.
I'm going to have to (garbled), Jim. Do you know that? (Laughter)
Sure is!
It's a great big fellow.
Okay, I'm going to stow the gear --
(garbled) go to Rate Command (garbled) CMC Mode (garbled)
Okay.
You (garbled) stabilize there at 50 feet or so and go to BMAG.
Okay. Going back to CMC.
Going back to CMC.
You can see the thrusters hitting the (garbled) on the (garbled)
What did he say?
I didn't hear it.
Apollo 9, this is Houston. We're going to lose you here in about 45 seconds, and we'll see you over Hawaii in about 5 minutes at 51.
Roger.
And we may have an ARIA in here, but if it is like the last one, we won't hear much out of you.
Just a minute. As a matter of fact, we would be better without it.
Okay. We will see you at 51.
How (garbled) to get there?
I hate to use all this fuel.
That's okay. Better to get it than - a little extra fuel, than not get it.
Can you see him, Davey?
Yes, I'm alright. I can see him, I just can't -
Yes, you're coming in good now.
Yes. Yes, it looks good.
I don't know where to point this stupid camera.
And, Apollo 9, this is Houston. We should have you through Hawaii. Standing by.
Roger.
Damn it, Jim, I just can't translate sideways.
Is that right?
Just can't do it.
Give it a big push.
I did! I'm on it.
You on it right now?
Yes. Look at that Delta-V counter, or the EMS, or the DSKY rather.
Yes, something's wrong.
Yes, these things are going crazy (garbled) Try it now.
It's coming.
Okay. Get her all lined up?
Okay, SCS, and ATT 1/RATE 2. Well, it looks like it ripped a little bit off the - off the top of the SLA on one side. Just a little piece hanging out there. That is looking beautiful now.
Well, that's looking beautiful, David. I'm going to start the camera again. Well, I'll wait for a minute here.
Yes.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. We've got you through the Redstone. Standing by.
Roger.
Roger, Houston. We are about 25 feet now and closing slowly.
Copy.
That looks beautiful, Dave.
(garbled) only way they'd do it, Dave.
Is it - is it damping it down - is the probe damping it down?
It's damped good, Jim. I want to get it lined up. Rusty, I want you to get 12 latches. Now we're coming. Patience.
Yes. We'll do it when you're ready, David.
It's very stable.
Isn't it, though?
Yes. I just want to make sure that we're really lined up. Okay, Jim, that looks like a good one. Have at it.
Okay, Retract coming now.
Here it comes. Coming in.
Come on, baby.
We're coming.
How about that! We got two of them. And we got a master alarm --
Alright, Houston; we're hard docked.
Roger, Apollo 9. Understand hard dock. Good show!
You know what I think it was?
What?
Probably a static discharge, because there was nothing on the caution and warning panel.
Yes.
Yes, that - Remember the old Agena?
Yes.
Hello, Houston, Apollo 9. We had a Master Alarm when we did the docking when we made the contact there, And we had some problems with our RCS thrusters we'll tell you about later.
Apollo 9, this is Houston. Understand you got a Master Alarm just as you docked, and I didn't copy about the RCS.
We'll tell it to you later, just a minute.
Roger.
Apollo - Houston, Apollo 9.
Go, Apollo 9.
Roger. We'll give you a quick rundown here. How much time do we have with you?
We've got you for a long time here. We're coming across the States here - just over California now.
Okay. I've got it. We came out just right. The angles were all just right. We got turned off, turned around, and lined up, and didn't have any left translation for some reason.
Roger. Copy, No left translation.
Houston, check quad A service module RCS for us.
Stand by a second, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, this is Houston. It looks okay to us. Do you have a question?
Roger. We just had a light on it, and it's difficult to tell with the helmets on whether we have any adjustment on it or not. Didn't see any motion - just wanted you to check.
Roger, Apollo 9. Copy.
Okay. The pressures all look good up here.
Houston, our package temp on the quad A is running about 200. What do you have down there?
Stand by, Apollo 9, and let's check it.
Houston, 9. Do you want to go on with the recap?
That's affirmative, Apollo 9. Let's press ahead, and your comm sort of cycles in and out. You are a little weak at times. We do confirm the temperature here however, and we will have some more words on that in a minute. And we are standing by for the rest of your recap.
Okay. When we got off, we were in pretty good shape and then for some reason we noticed that we didn't have any left translation and tried to figure out why. Finally noticed that the primary quad C and secondary quad C isolation valves were closed, and the secondary Dog was closed, and by this time we had moved over somewhat to the side. It took us a while to get back after we got that sorted out and probably used up quite a bit of gas getting us squared away, but the docking was smooth. The capture latches worked just right, there were no oscillations after we captured. We lined it up and did the retract, and it took about 10 seconds, and it sounded like we got a good solid lock.
Roger, Apollo 9. Copied all that real good.
And, Apollo 9, this is Houston. We will have another state vector for you over Bermuda.
Roger.
And you should be coming just about overhead, Apollo 9. You ought to be over Texas.
Roger.
