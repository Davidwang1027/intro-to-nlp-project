the alarm clock just went off, gentlemen.
Roger. I thought I heard a little dingaling there, Mr. Alarm Clock.
Alright. Out of the sack, troops; let's get to work. Today you come home.
Hot diggity dog! I think we're already.
Okay. What would you like to do?
Okay. What do you have in front of you?
switch, I think.
Okay. Do you want to start with the consumables?
Okay. Stand by.
Alrighty. Go with the consumables.
Okay. 234 hours: 42 10 42 12 33 13 38 13 195 11 40 31 39. Okay. And your DAP red line: 25 31 34 34.
Roger. 234 42 10 42 12 33 13 38 13 195 11 40 31 39 25 31 34 and 34.
Roger. And you've probably noticed, there, quad C is a little low. However, we still have both DAP and SCS capability using 4 jet / 2 jet.
Okay. Understand.
All right. And one other comment before we get too far: I'd like to just mention that the DAP is still cycling, so when you get squared away on that - I just want to let you know that the DAP is still powered up.
Oh, is it really? That's very interesting.
Okay. And, let me see. Oh, one thing else, I guess. I - just for your info, on the batteries, we are computing that you've got 71 hours on the water, if that question ever comes up.
Okay. Take a look at our Verb 46 right now.
Okay. The story I have here, Dave, is that you need a Verb 46 enter to really kill the DAP.
I put that in last night, too, Stu.
Say again, please?
I put that in last night, too.
Oh. Okay. We'll have them take another look then. Okay. I have some block data for you.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. Go with the block data.
Okay. And make sure your S-band volume is up. We might pass over Honeysuckle before I finish up.
All right.
Okay. Reading: 148 1 Bravo, plus 256, minus 0640 233:53:37:40.46; 149 1 Charlie, plus 314 minus 0680 235:30:22 3635; 150 2 Bravo, plus 270, minus 0310 237:27:07 3159; 151 1 Charlie, plus 309, minus 0670 238:51:15 3033; 152 2 Alpha, plus 233, minus 0680 240:32:58 3402; 153 4 Bravo, plus 336, minus 1610 243:11:54 3268; 154 4 Bravo, plus 310, minus 1600 244:52:53 3038; 155 - Okay. I think I'm back with you again. I blotted out on that 155 didn't I?
I lost you on the longitude at 154 4 Bravo.
Okay. Longitude: minus 1600 244:52:53 3038; 155 4 Bravo, plus 239, minus 1594 246:35:09 3337; 156 Charlie, Charlie, plus 122, minus 1640 248:11:25 3083. Your pitch and yaw trim: minus 0.64, yaw minus 0.94 period. End of update.
Okay. Gee, I didn't know we were going to go that far, but here you go: 148 1 Bravo, plus 256, minus 0640 233:53:37 4046. 149 1 Charlie, plus 314 minus 0680 235:30:22 3635; 150 2 Bravo, plus 270, minus 0310 237:27:07 3159; 151 1 Charlie, plus 309, minus 0670 238:51:15 3033; 152 2 Alpha, plus 233, minus 0680 240:32:58 3402; 153 4 Bravo, plus 336, minus 1610 243:11:54 3268; 154 4 Bravo, plus 310, minus 1600 244:52:53 3038; 155 4 Bravo, plus 239, minus 1594 246:35:09 3337; 156 Charlie, Charlie, plus 122, minus 1640 248:11:25 3083; with a pitch trim of minus 0.64, and a yaw trim of minus 0.94.
Roger. That's correct. Stand by one.
Okay.
And, read back is correct, Dave.
Alrighty.
And, Since I was mean enough to wake you up with an alarm clock, I can give you some good news. The on the hour report from the Guadalcanal says there are calm seas, winds are five knots, visibility 10 miles, 3000 scattered, and there are some five foot swells with about a 10 second. And the ship is about 35 miles from the target point now.
Hey, that's a pretty good description of the kind of weather we like.
Well, you put in an order, we strive to please.
You guys are absolutely outstanding.
And, let me see. We still got you here for about another two minutes. The daylight darkness as shown in your Flight Plan is off. It's slipped some. I might I might update you on that, if you think that will help you any of your planning. I'll just call out the stations.
Okay. Let me get the Flight Plans. Just a minute.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. Well, we've got you now in the night time coming across here, but you'll come out of this darkness just over Texas at about 23 - something like that. These times are just rough; I don't think you'll need these. And then you'll go back to Carnarvon darkness again right at 18; and that's at 235 plus 18 and come out over Guaymas around... Okay. And then you'll hit back in again at 236 plus 48 over Carnarvon; come back into daylight about 237 plus 25, and then darkness again at 238 plus 20, and daylight at 238 plus 55. You probably should be realigned by then, but I'll give you the last one here. At 239:52 you'll go into darkness again and come out just before the burn at 240 about 25.
And we're going to have LOS here momentarily. We'll pick you up over the Mercury - standby, I'll try to settle down here oh, in about 4 minutes.
Okay. Fine.
Apollo 9, Houston through Mercury.
Roger, Houston. We have you. Go.
Okay. We'd like to have inverter 3, Off.
Roger. Inverter 3, Off, now.
And also, just to get squared away here in plenty of time, we'd like to ask you the question about two-jet versus four-jet on the burn. The two-jet would save around pounds per quad, or about don't for can't understand.
How much fuel do we have? We have quite a bit of fuel extra, don't we?
You're right on the red lines now, Jim. It's - It's right there. This is quad Charlie. Quad Charlie is right on the red lines, as you can see. We passed 33, and 34 is the DAP red line. But you know, this is within the gauging uncertainty, and so forth and so on and that's...
Okay. B and D are well up, aren't they?
We'll do a two-jet, then, Stu
Okay. You'd like to do a two-jet, then?
Yes. We'll do an 18-second two-jet on - what? B and D, I guess.
Roger, Jim. We concur with that.
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, Stu, why didn't we get a drop in pressure, and all that stuff? Is there any - Do the guys on the ground think that maybe we have the secondary propellant fuel pressures Open on quad C?
That appears to be a good possibility; as we told you, it should have opened up. There's a plus or minus 6 percent on that doggone estimate. So you - but still yet we should be down below that. And so, the feeling here is, it's quite possible that that secondary valve is open.
Okay.
We did a lot of talking about that here this morning, And you know, we had those funnies on that separation. And we're - we're just not real sure.
Yes. That's sort of what I was thinking of too. Hey, have you done anything - any new information on our DAP here?
No, We sure haven't. You know, to get us squared away down here, to make sure we're reading right, could you give us a Verb 46 enter?
Okay. I'll proceed out of the Verb 48; Then we'll give you Verb 46. Okay. Here comes the Verb 46 now.
Okay.
Okay. That got us squared away, Jim, And we show the DAP in good shape.
You mean the DAP really was running, then?
All our data showed it was; yes.
I'll be darned. We got three-way verification on that one last night, but maybe it didn't get in.
Roger. Copy.
Hey, Stu
Go ahead, Dave,
Yes, we just decided to have a 6-I verification on the DAP. You want to add two?
Okay.
Okay. Apollo 9, Houston. I have you for another couple of minutes. Before I lose you here at Mercury, I guess I can cover a couple of changes that we'd like in the Flight Plan.
Okay. Stand by.
And by the way, you want to come off the H2 fan 2?
Stand by
That's negative. We do not want it Off, we'll leave it just like it is.
Okay. Go with your changes and I've got a question for you after you get through.
Okay. Why don't you go ahead and ask it, Dave?. We're going to lose you probably in about a minute and and a half and I can cover those changes when we see you over Texas at 20.
Okay. Do you want to activate the primary boiler? And, if so, do you want to reservice first? And, we've talked it over decided we think it's a good idea to cold soak before we come down. What do you think?
Roger. Copy two questions. One is whether you want to reservice the primary boiler before you activate it, and you have decided you'd like to cold soak. We'll try to give you a recommendation on that.
Okay. Fine.
And, we're approaching LOS here, troops. We'll see you about 20.
Roger. 20.
Apollo 9, Houston. We have you in good lock.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 9. We are still here.
Very good. And on your questions, we concur with the cold soak. On the water boiler, we say do not reservice it prior to bringing it up. The reason for this is, we are not sure how much water is in there, and we would like to go ahead and bring it up and see whether it will dry out. It should dry out in the first daylight passes, and we'll be looking at it.
Okay. So you want us to bring it up right now?
That's affirmative. Let's bring - go ahead and bring it on the line.
Alrighty. Here we go.
Hey, Houston, 9. Do you have one of those handy dandy map updates around?
Roger. Standby one, here. While I'm trying to locate that ditty, I'd like to pass up a couple of changes to you.
Okay. Stand by a second.
Okay. Go with your changes, Stu.
Okay. On your CO2 filter change at 236, or at - The second line, should read 8 to B, reuse 20 to B6.
Roger. Understand 8 to B and reuse 20 to B6.
Okay, period now with the addition of the other rev, there is a lot of changes, such as the time you do the star check and all that, which I really don't think you need. But I've got them all written out here, and the times, if you'd like to take that.
No. I think what we're going to do is get the IMU up, and on the next rev do a P51 and get it all squared away. And then, the night side pass before the deorbit burn, we're going to get to the burn attitude early and make sure we get a good solid star check, because the horizon probably won't be too good just prior to the retro.
Okay. Real good. As to most of the Flight Plan changes I have here, they are just reflecting changes in daylight and dark and the addition of the Rev; so, that's really, I believe, all you need to change on your Flight Plan this time. And we do have a couple of, would you believe, changes to the entry checklist I'd like to talk to you about.
Well, I believe that. You've had about 10 days, and I'd be surprised if you didn't have any changes.
Okay. And I found my map update sheet here, if you want to take that too,
Okay. Go with the map update, and we'll dig out the entry checklist in the meantime.
Okay. Rev 147, which is completing, 234:15:36; longitude one, 107 west
Roger. 234:15:36; 107 west. Right?
Okay. Go ahead with the entry checklist, Stu.
Okay. Let's start here on page E1 dash one.
All right.
Okay. The first one - these are out now, but I'll just toss in the reminder - the very first line on panel 8, your heater gauging circuit breakers main A and main B, we want those open.
Okay. Got that.
Okay, now you're still under the SCS, the next to last line, auto RCS select, the checklist is showing 16 Main B. We'd recommend the Command Module 1. Main A comma, Command Module 2. Main B, and A/C roll. Main B.
Okay. I guess that's a must first. We'll do that.
All right. And now, on page E1-C, right at the top right under C, you can just delete the stir the tanks.
Okay. Just delete Step C. Is that right?
That's affirmative. Delete step Charlie.
Okay. Go ahead.
Alright. On page E1 13/14.
Go.
Okay. Here, the third line down, the SCS logic 2 on up: We'd like to have that moved just above the MSFN confirmed Go for Pyro Arm. And essentially, what we're trying to do here, is make sure that you have your ELS to auto, ELS logic on - then, when you throw the SCS logic, we know we're all squared away to give you a Go.
Okay, Houston. Understand. It'll read CB Sequential Arm, 2, Close, ELS Auto and ELS Logic, On, and then, Sequential Logic, 2, On up.
Okay. 10102. Go ahead.
Okay. On page E2-3.
That's affirmative. Jolly good on that one period. Now on page E2-1.
Okay. Go.
And this, I know you're well aware of. I'm just tossing it in with our decision to go wth the two-jet ullage: that Register 1 under the DAP 10102.
Go.
All right. Down here at minus 30 seconds we'd like to - the first two lines there, we'd like to reverse the order of them. We'd like to have the Tape Recorder, Record high bitrate, Forward, to be first, followed by Average g, On, Up Telemetry, Command Reset and then Normal.
Okay. So it will read this way: Tape Recorder, Record high bit rate, Forward, and then Average G, On, Up Telemetry, Command Reset and then Normal.
That's affirmative. And, just for your info, that's just to keep us from having to reacquire the data lock there. Okay. And now over on page E26.
Go ahead.
Okay. We're showing auto RCS Select Command Module, 1, Main B. Change that to read Main A and this will agree with the configuration that we recommended over on the first page.
Okay. So it will read auto RCS select CM 1 Main A.
That is affirmative.
Go ahead.
Okay. That's all I have.
Gee. That's not bad at all.
Very good.
Okay. Well, I guess everything else is squared away on that. We went through it last night, and we don't have any questions on it. So if you see anything else, you can give a whistle.
Okay. We sure will.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. I was a little surprised asking for that map update. Are you all going to be taking any pictures this morning?
Say, listen. We're the world's greatest spectators.
Okay. Are you going to have your cameras out at all this morning, Jim?
No, We really don't have much in the way of film left, Stu. We've got about 15 frames on the Hasselblad left and we've got about - oh, I think we have three film packs with 16mm, and have about a quarter of a roll left on them. We do plan on taking pictures of the re entry. We have one full roll of 16mm reserved for that.
Okay. The reason why I asked you, we've got a SVM in here from Australia, requesting some specific pictures, and I wasn't even going to mention it to you. I thought on re-entry day you wouldn't be interested. But if you've got a camera out coming across Australia, why, there's some people down there want some pictures.
That's okay. We've been trying to get a picture of Australia, too. When are we going to go across?
Well, let me check my terminator here. I think you're going to be in darkness, but, Perth - in regards to your comment the other night - Perth wanted some pictures of their lights.
Okay. We'll see what we can do here. Give us the time.
Roger. Will do.
OK, Jim. For the picture of Perth - you might bring up your S-band volume, here, two. We'll be going over to Madrid.
Go ahead with the times, Stu...
ahead, Stu. We're here.
Okay. We don't have your time, now, period to get Perth, It's going to be two revs from now, and the best time it's putting you is up at about 238 plus 12, which looks like it's getting up toward the busy section.
Okay. We'll write it down on the Flight Plan. If we can get it, we'll try to get it.
Okay. Let me give you the exact time, here, for Perth. It'll be 236 plus 27 plus 38. That's your closest approach.
Okay. Will they be north or south of track?
You'll be just about over them. You'll have about an 82 degree angle on them, so you'll be coming right over in about 226 miles.
Okay.
Okay. Apollo 9. We've got about a minute here, I believe, off of Madrid. Can you give us a crew status report? If not, we'll catch you at Carnarvon at 11.
This is the Commander. I had about six hours of good sleep. About one hour of poor sleep, And I took one Actifed.
I had some - CMP - and I had about 7½ hours of good sleep and - no; I had a vitamin pill yesterday.
And I had a vitamin pill, too.
Roger. I copy both.
Rusty had 8 hours of good sleep, one Seconal, one Actifed, and one vitamin pill.
Roger. Understand. Thank you very much.
Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 9.
Read you loud and clear.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go ahead, Apollo 9.
What quads do you want to use for the early part of today? A and B or...
Roger. Copy. Standby.
Okay. Apollo 9, Houston. We are recommending that you just go ahead and use all of them for this since we won't really be using that much, and we'd like to have all four on bringing up the platform.
Okay. You'd like to have all 4 of the quads on when we bring up the platform?
That is affirmative. And you can just go ahead and leave all four on with the exception of the 2-jet ullage that we've already discussed.
Okay.
Would you bring up your S-band? We'll be going over to Honeysuckle in a couple of minutes.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead. Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger. Guadalcanal is on station and is waiting.
Very good. Thank you.
Roger.
Houston, What are you talking to us through?
Stand by one, and I'll see what I'm uplinking. Wait. Where through Honeysuckle; it's got to be S-band.
Okay.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. Jim, Since you were so agreeable about that picture of, particularly of Perth - there, that was - the data I gave you was for Rev 150. You'll come within about 80 miles of it on the next Rev around, if you'd like to take that time, if you think it's going to be feasible.
Okay.
Are you ready to copy?
We sure can see a lot of lights down on the city, down on the ground right now, Stu.
Okay. Just a second.
Roger. No sweat. It will be on the next rev.
Okay. Why don't you go ahead and give us the data here; I'll write it down now.
Okay. For Perth, your time of closest approach: 236 plus 51 plus 36, and Perth will be 82 miles north of track.
Okay. And what's the other one?
Okay. The other one will be Brisbane: TCA, 237:00 plus 41. And it will be 110 miles north of the track.
Roger. There's two cities - well, there's actually three. Sydney will be about 228 miles off your track the next time around, but Perth and Brisbane both are - Perth will be 80 and Brisbane 110, and sure like to get some pictures of those, if you can work it in.
Okay. Very good. We'll try to get them.
Okay. And I don't know whether you can reach out 220 miles or not, but if you've got your camera out, I might as well give you one for Sydney, and that will wipe us out.
Okay. Go ahead.
All right. Sydney: TCA, 236 plus 59 plus 37. And Sydney will be 228 miles south of track.
Okay. We'll have two north and one south. Is that correct?
That is affirmative. And you'll hit Perth first, of course. By the time - we're going to leave here at the Honeysuckle; see you over the Mercury around 31.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
You're over the hill, I believe.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
Roger. Would you tell the good people of Sydney that we saw their lights about five minutes ago? It was a very beautiful sight.
Good. Mighty fine. Thank you.
Good morning, Ron. How are you?
Hey, fine shape, and all set to go.
Very good. Thank you.
Where are you going, Ron?
Hey, that's a good question, come to think of it.
Apollo 9, Houston. About LOS; will pick you up at Redstone.
Roger.
Houston, you got enough to get the gyro torquing angles, or did you copy them?
No, we missed them.
Do you want to read them?
Affirmative. Go.
OK. was 235:34:00, minus 00128, minus 00781, plus...
Apollo 9, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 9. Go.
Roger. We copied your torquing angles, and we'll have you all the way through Canaries. LOS will be 19.
Okay. Did you copy what type alignment it was?
Negative.
Okay. We did a nominal to time 240:30:08 in order to get the platform up into place.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
Roger. Our original Flight Plan schedule was for an H2 Purge this morning, and did you want us to do that?
Stand by one, there.
Apollo 9, Houston. The fuel cells are looking good here. Disregard H2 Purge.
Okay.
Request P00 and Accept, then we'll have a state vector and target load and a REFSMMAT for you.
You've got it.
Roger. Coming up.
Apollo 9, Houston. I have your maneuver PAD.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. Ready to copy, Ron.
Okay. Purpose 152 dash 1 Alpha; 240:31:13.78; minus 01969, plus all zips, plus 02585; 0325.0, 0308.1, 011.6, 24,888, minus 064, minus 094; 15, 026.10, 329.00, minus 2990, plus 10536 2329. Over.
Okay. 152 dash 1 Alpha; 240:31:13.78; minus 01969, plus all zips, plus 02585; 0325.0, 0308.1, 011.6, 24,888; minus 064, minus 094; 15, 026.10, 329.00; minus 2990, plus 10536 2329. Over.
Roger. That is correct.
Apollo 9, Houston. The computer is yours. You have a state vector, target load, REFSMMAT, and we've Verb 66'd it.
Oh, very well. That sounds like a full day's work. Thank you.
Roger. If you're in a copying mood, I have your entry PAD.
Okay. Stand by one.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. Area: 152 dash 1 Alpha, 046; plus 23.25, minus 068.00; 1201.5, 25996, 15:27, 16:03, minus 03177. The roll right: 50, 60, 19:01, 15:56, 19:29, 23:46, 24:33; plus 42, plus 075. Over.
Roger. I've got 152 dash 1 Alpha, 046; plus 23.25, minus 068.00; 1201.5, 25996, 15:27, 16:03, minus 03177. Right roll: 50, 60, 19:01, 15:56, 19:29, 23:46, 24:33; plus 42, plus 075. Over.
Apollo 9, Houston. You're read back is correct.
Houston, again. Let me recheck the CO2 filter, would you? Which one was 20 supposed to replace? Number 8 or number 9?
Stand by one, there.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
I think I have it sorted out now. You want to put 8 and 9 in; you want to take 20 out and put in B6; and take one out and put it in A3. Is that right?
9, Houston. I think that's - 9, Houston. I think that's correct, there, but let me double check it with FAO.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Here's the way the canister - the way I take it. You put 8 and 9 in - 8 in the B slot, 9 in the A slot, and close the door; and you take 20 and stow it in B-6; and you take number one canister and stow it in Alpha 3.
Okay. That's what I thought. We just wanted to make sure that we got the right ones going in the right place because, surprisingly enough, the CO2 canisters were not marked for the flight.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 9, Houston. I have a comment for your entry update.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston through Canaries.
Roger. How do you read now?
Roger. Loud and clear. Your comment for your entry update. There is: You put the 31.4 degree window mark on the horizon at 0.05g.
Okay. Understand the 31.4 degree line on the window on the horizon at 0.05g.
Roger and you will lose your sextant star at 240 plus 16 plus 53.
Understand. We lose the sextant star at 240:16:53.
Affirmative.
Oh, let's see. I've got to undo that.
That's forward. I'll go ahead and.
Okay, what do you think of E-57
Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon.
Roger, Houston. Go.
Roger, Dave. We are not getting any EKG on you. If it's something real simple, fine; otherwise, we'll just get by with your respiration.
Okay. I'll give it a quick check.
Apollo 9, Houston. Looks like you fixed the EKG, there.
Say again.
Roger. It looks like your EKG is good, now.
Oh, okay. It was a loose connector.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston. S-band volume up for Honeysuckle.
Roger. S-band up for Honeysuckle.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go. We read you.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
Roger. Did you get the gyro torquing angles?
Negative. You went over the hill just before we got them.
Okay. GET of 237:05:30. Minus 00.395, minus 00.223, plus 00.534. And that's to the desired REFSMMAT that you sent up.
Roger. We copy.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Roger.
Did you want an E memory dump today?
That's affirmative. Standby, and I'll give you a time on it.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 9.
Roger. The computer was powered up all night, So I guess we don't need E mem - E mod dump.
Okay. Very good.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
Houston, We were doing a DSKY lamp test there, and I hit a reset at the end of the thing; got a 212 Alarm, which in our book says PIPA failed or PIPA not being used. Says do a PIPA bias check. What do you think about that?
Apollo 9, Houston. I think that's the same thing we saw the other night when you did that, and we think it's normal, but stand by one.
Okay.
And, 9, Houston. We are getting bias checks down here anyhow, so PIPA bias check not necessary.
Okay. I think - but you understand the question? We got a 212 alarm, and I guess you can see it on the DSKY as well as we can, so okay.
Affirmative. We understand.
Alrighty.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 9.
Roger. We're sure that's a normal thing. It's the power supply that gets interrupted when you do that DSKY check, and all you have to do now is hit Error Reset.
Good. We're very good at that Error Reset.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston. We'll pick you up at Redstone at 20.
Roger. Redstone at 20.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We still have the secondary loop coming on the line, and will have you until about 54.
Okay. Very good.
Houston, Apollo 9. We've opened all. Did you see any change of state in anything on the ground?
Houston, Apollo 9. Do you read?
Apollo 9, Houston. Affirmative. Go.
Okay. We are going to open our secondary propellant fuel pressure valves in the Service Module RCS, now.
Roger. Go ahead.
Negative. No change down here; which is good.
Yes.
Apollo 9, Houston. Anout one minute LOS; Tananarive at 07 Sunset will be at 20.
Roger. Thank you.
clockwise.
just punched the warning light on. I guess. power.
supervise.
Oh, no.
Where are we?
Oh, I know. Alright, go ahead..
See about where we are.
We ought to be over coming over United States
No.
What kind of azimuth did you have.
Apollo, 9, Houston through Tananarive.
Hello, Houston; this is Apollo 9.
Roger. If you turn H2 tank 2 fan, On, that may pump up the pressure in the H2 tanks, there.
Okay. You want the fan, On in H2 tank 1?
Tank 1 and tank 2.
Okay. Tanks 1 and 2 fans, On.
Roger.
Roger. You want the heaters on, also - to get the pressure up?
Apollo 9, Houston. Say again.
Roger. Do you want the heaters on, also - to get the pressure up?
Apollo 9, Houston. Negative.
Do you know altitude.
Okay. weather some weather photography.
Turn up! You thing. go.
There's a satellite! Very bright large.
Me too.
Right.
Here's another one.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Yes, I want to.
We've got to get back.
Okay. go.
get an idea what our GET says..
An hour and 11 minutes, we're off about 4 degrees in roll; that's about - oh, about - 2 degrees in pitch; and it's off simply nothing in yaw.
Sounds like that is pretty good. must have drifted back in again.
frankly.
Sure, it was off more than that in like more than normal in pitch.
Guess which star we're star check?
Which star would you like for your check?
Achernar!
Sirius!
That a boy.
Sirius, the good one?
That's the good one.
That's only when you can still see it..
16.
Everybody else is done with this equipment?
Yes.
Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon.
Hello, Houston. Apollo 9, here. We are just doing our star attitude check at this time, and we are going to follow that up with the last P52 to REFSMMAT. We're standing by at the 1-hour point on our checklist.
Roger. We copy. Tell Dave to watch out for a flare from Perth at 26, and don't mistake it for his sextant star, there.
Okay.
Houston, which direction is Perth from our track? North or south?
Roger. It should be 28 miles north.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
Okay three 8's on the DSKY.
Roger. We copy.
And we're just a tad off on attitude.
Roger.
I've got an oddball COAS star there, if Jim wants to look at it,
Okay. What is it?
Roger. It's - I can't even pronounce it P-Y-X-I-D-I-S But it's a 4th magnitude star closest to Regor, on a line between Regor and Alphard.
And it should...
Hey, you...
Say again
You really found...
We really found a good one. It should be about a half of a degree up, and 1.7 degrees to the left.
Apollo 9, Houston. S-band volume up for Honeysuckle.
Roger. Honeysuckle, and S-band up. David came through on the last one. Look at that! All balls!
Hey, beautiful. You guys are getting pretty good up there.
Well, we want to go out with a flash, here.
I'm going to hang it up right now.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
How long before Retrofire do we come out into daylight? Will I have a daylight horizon - horizon - or not?
Roger. You have sunrise at 25. Burn time is at 31.
Okay.
And, 9, Houston. We moved over there a bit in our orbit; we'll use antenna Bravo for the deorbit burn.
Okay. Antenna Bravo for deorbit burn.
And we'll still stay on Charlie for entry.
Okay.
Okay, I'll put it away..
Oh, where's the tape?
Probably hanging up there on the...
No, I put it away, Rusty. Do you want some? I've got a few feet left.
Yes. I want to - I'd like - Is it too far away?
No, you know, it's really...
I'd like to tape up my pocket.
Oh, that stuff is the stuff you don't want to get...
Yes. Well, no, I don't care if it gets - This is non- wet stuff, that's okay. This is the wet stuff but it's stuff I don't want to fall out. So I'm going to...
Sounds like a good idea, anyway. Tape it. Okay. (Humming). Go someplace.
Well, I've got to go down there anyway to stow the PIC's and all.
Up at the top? In the front?
Those are I've seen before. I guess.
I've never seen that.
Boy. This thing sure wants to go out of plane, doesn't it?
Yes. It always wants to go someplace where you don't want it to go.
Okay. That's all done.
transponder out.
What I like about this program, it sure makes a difference for launch degrees.
Are you cold?
I was just standing down there with this thing blowing on me. Pretty cool.
above your head, Jim. I'll get it.
Hey, here's by.
Good.
Yes.. Boing! Boing!
Oh, that's good news.
Yes, great.
Oh, oh. Say, that's just terrific.
Yes sir, man. Those things just look real good. If they'd stay on, they might be dead weight.
(Laughter)
landing. How come landing.
Have we got any film left in the tunnel?
Oh, yes. Checklist is up there.
Did we separate those checklists, Jim?
Yes - no. Not the entry checklist.
(Yawn) You haven't received the update for it, right?
Yes.
Okay. I think I will take one of those pieces of tape. Where is the tape, Dave?
three.
Here's the tape. I'll put it back in.
Well, I guess I'll get in my suit. Dress up. Buckle down. (Singing)
I've got to stow the PFC's and all that Junk.
(Singing).
Okay. alright.
Yes..
Okay. (Laughter) I think they just contribute to breaking your ankle right off.
Oh, shoot. I've got ORDEAL.
Yes. That's in the checklist, Jim. We haven't quite got there yet.
do that.
Do you think.
that bag.
Will you deposit that someplace down there for me?
Thank you.
Okay.
Can you tell which is the right bag and which is the left bag? They're all the same to me.
I'm going to add a little attitude simulation.
Attitude simulation?
Simulation for the real time?
Yes, what do you mean by an attitude simulation?
If I did, I could see the from up through the window.
Oh, that's a good idea!
We're supposed to Retro at 240:31:14; the time on the Retro is - third Retro at 9:01.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger. We've been integrating your state vector and we'd like to update you another one. We'll do it in about 2 minutes at Redstone.
Okay.
Okay. You've got P00 and Accept.
Roger. Will do it probably at 58.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead. Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger. We had real weak signal strengths there at Redstone. We'll catch it up at Goldstone.
Okay. Very good. Get it at Goldstone.
9, Houston. Request Accept.
Roger. You've got it.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead. Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger. We'd like for you to whip through P30 and P40 again and reload those two programs. After you...
We've got a 2101 on the DSKY now flashing. Can you get in, or are you through, or what?
Negative. We are not through yet. Soon as the computer is yours, you can go into that. And I have a Nav check here if you want it.
All right. Stand by.
Okay. Go ahead with the Nav check.
Roger. 240:00:00.00, minus 3112, plus 10039 2298. Over.
Roger. 240:00:00.00, minus 3112, plus 10039 2298, and just what exactly are you uplinking on this mode?
We are just uplinking a state vector.
Okay. State vector uplink. I understand.
Okay. That means we are going to have to reload P30.
Affirmative.
Apollo 9, Houston. The computer is yours.
Thank you.
Okay. We have got it, and we will go through P30 now for you.
Roger. And we just wanted to give you a little better hit record than you had in playing baseball a while back.
Oh, hey. We were real sorry in that ball game. We should really be great today.
That's right.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
Okay. That gives us a 10th of a foot per second difference Delta-VR, but I guess we can take that, huh?
9, Houston. Say again. I missed it.
I say that gives us about a 10th of a foot per second difference in Delta-VR, but I guess we can take that.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston. One minute LOS. Ascension 30.
Roger, Houston.
do it like that.
Oh no!
What?
Got the screwy bastards on upside down.
Well, you do, too.

Great.
How about that?
Great. We put on two sets of long underwear too, just expecting it would be cold.
I'm going to open up these EDS circuit breakers
I missed it there.
I said, we even put two sets of long underwear on just so we'd be warm in the water.
Roger. I don't think it'll be necessary.
Okay, Rusty, what else you got?
CB Docking Probe, two, Open.
Docking Probe, Open.

Houston, if we fire the RCS - command RCS pressurization On, can you still support?
Apollo 9, Houston. Negative. We'll catch you at Carnarvon.
Okay.
Okay.
Pyro Arm, On.
Okay.
You doing alright?
Eating all that fruitcake - before the big one. fruitcake, do you?
No.
You don't think it's a 350-pound fruitcake?
No.
Okay - We're on.
I finally figured it out (laughter), but it sure isn't the way we been doing it.
Oh, no! We used them all night again. We used the 90-degree roll and leave this one at zero. This one always stays where it is - at 55 degrees. Come down just like the others.
Well, that's what I thought, too. I just looked at the numbers, and I don't think they'd at all. But it might.
It might take their numbers and put them on a 55-degree roll and right there.
Do we want to turn the logic into?
No..
55, 55, Jim?
50, 60. 50; 60; you said we were starting to roll.
Oh, I don't have that stuff there. I just got my, if I don't get there!
Yes!.
There goes the EMS; that probably won't work.
Let's hold those things up at the light.
we checked it out.
Hmmm boy, good to the last grape.

Okay. The horizon is going to come back up here in just a minute.
That's a fair bang.
Looked nice.
Yes, very nice. We need just a few more.
6 minutes TFF.
Okay.
How does that compare with the...
20 seconds, 0.05g.
difference? Okay.
Okay, we're definitely blunt end forward, and we're definitely upside down; all I've got to do is get up to the horizon now and...
Hey, there's the Salton Sea.
How about that?
Again, huh?
Again.
Gee, I don't wait. Okay.
Okay, we're getting...
Start the EMS manually at RET of 0.05g, huh?
Okay, we haven't gotten any updates yet, have we?
No.
No, we got the DET reset to 3 minutes and counting up, right?
Right.
Okay, set your RET at 0.05g; Jim, got that?
RET at 0.05g is 15:27, right.
Right.
Wish I could see that stupid DET.
Yes, it's 10:05 right now.
EMS is still saying they're going to get there 20 seconds earlier.
There the horizon comes.
Okay, everybody got their heels in?
Yes.
Heels are in.
Okay, P6...
Set the horizon up to the 32-degree line.
How's that water?
It's good; 50 percent.
Let me check how that water boiler is doing. The water boiler is doing alright.
There go the needles - that a boy - right where they are supposed to come.
Both water boilers are working good.
Okay, fine. Okay, the horizon is coming up just like it ought to come. I mean, the bar's coming up just like it ought to come.
We'll settle the dust here in a minute.
Say again.
I said we'll start settling the dust here in just a minute.
3 minutes. 3 minutes..
Okay, we're - That's off; we're on 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2; one is Up; one is Up; one is Up; one is Up; one is Up; one is Up. How is the Prop doing?
Propellant's good. I just checked them both.
That is well.
