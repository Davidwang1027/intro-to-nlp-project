Hello. Apollo 9, this is Houston. Anybody up there got their S-band up?
Apollo 9, this is Houston. How do you read?
Good morning, Apollo 9.
Good morning! How are you this bright, sunshiny morning!
Apollo 9, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Oh! Good morning. Even though it is dark outside, it must be time to get up.
Oh, I guess it must be. You're calling.
Oh, yes.
Houston, how do you read me?
I read you loud and clear.
Okay.
Now, we let you grab 1 extra hour, but we figured if we let you sleep too long here, you would oversleep on RETRO morning.
Oh, we'll try not to do that.
Okay. I didn't figure you would.
We've got you zigging across Mercury, here. I'll have you for about the next 7 minutes.
Alrighty. What would you like to start on?
Well, I have bloc data or the consumables update. Which is the easiest?
Well, let me find the book and find out.
Houston, Apollo 9. Why don't we start with the consumables? Those are only two digits apiece.
Okay. You're coming through a little weak, there, Dave. How are you reading me?
Your part's clear. How me now?
You're real good. Okay. The consumables first: 185 hours 43 10 42 12 44 13 43 13 285 20 32 27 39. And your DAP redlines, service module: 25 31 34 34. End of consumables.
Roger. 185 43 10 42 12 44 13 43 13 285 20 32 27 39 25 31 34 34.
Roger. Houston confirms the update. And would you like to take some block data?
Well, I reckon. Stand by one.
Okay.
Okay, Stu. I've got the appropriate squares. Go ahead and fill them.
Okay. Reading block data number 19: 119 1 Bravo, plus 262, minus 0640 187 03 40 3515; 120 1 Bravo, plus 318, minus 0680 188 42 36 3106; 121 1 Bravo, plus 336, minus 0663 190 25 20 3005; 122 1 Alpha, plus 303, minus 0660 192 07 02 3445; 123 4 Alpha, plus 312, minus 1632 194 43 50 3198; 124 4 Bravo, plus 336, minus 1630 196 25 35 2993; 125 4 Alpha, plus 312 minus 1632 198 07 06 3221; 126 3 Bravo, plus 337, plus 1490 199 25 49 2998. Pitch and yaw trim: minus 0.64, minus 0.94. We've got about 60 seconds. Read them back as fast as you can.
Roger. I missed the second batch. You broke up.
The second block, you say?
That's affirm.
Okay. Reading second block: 120 1 Bravo, plus 318, minus 0680 188 42 36 3106. And we'd better take your readback over Antigua at 57. We'd like to turn off the fan on H2 tank 2, and turn off inverter 3.
Okay. We'll clean up to suit you. What was the longitude on the first area?
Okay. Longitude is minus 0640.
Okay. See you at 57.
Roger.
Yes. You do pretty good.
Houston Yes.
use all that hydrogen, did we?
Huh?
I said didn't use all that hydrogen.
Oh, no, it can still go up another 20 psi. That's worth about, you know, 3 or 4 pounds of hydrogen.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
I could feel it.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1 - Hello, hello, hello.
Hello.
Shoot, I'd been awake an hour and a half.
Have you really?
Yes. No use turning around After that last pass that guy was giving us.
Now you're talking.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
You're loud and clear.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I woke up at 184 hours and 20 minutes back to sleep.
Oh, really?
Yes?
How come you didn't want them to call you?
still sleeping.
There, I can have my morning gas. One thing I like for breakfast is hydrogen and cocoa.
Hot what?
Hydrogen and cocoa.
Oh, hydrogen and cocoa. Yes, that is good.
Do you know what time it is?
Yes, it's really nice in our house, isn't it?
they're all open.
We had in the window last night.
Whoo, it's dark out.
Yes.
Where'd you find it? Really?
Oh, bang. Right in there. we got - got 20-20 Okay.
Oh, there's the problem.
You mean that one?
The one we're going on?
What?
Good idea.
Well, it's plus 20 and minus 40, minus 50. 30, plus 30

Apollo 9, Houston. How do you read?
Roger. We're reading you.
Houston, Apollo 9. We're reading you.
No lock.
Apollo 9, Houston. How do you read?
Roger. Five by.
I'm reading you real good. Apollo 9, we'd like to start a charge on battery Baker.
What?
Rusty, I guess you can see pretty good over there now, can't you?
Okay. Battery Baker per charge.
I'm trying to see the ground, but the window
Yes.
Okay. And our RCS configuration today: we're recommending using quads Charlie and Delta, and AC roll.
Roger. Use Charlie and Delta; use AC roll.
That's affirmative. Apollo 9, if you wish, you could - I'm ready for a readback from the block data.
Okay. Stand by one.
Okay. Block data. Are you ready?
I'm ready. Let her rip.
Okay. The first couple here - There were some breakups, even though I got some extra, so you might watch then: 119 1 Bravo, plus 262, minus 0640 187 03 40 3525; 120 1 Bravo, plus 318, minus 0680 183 42 36 3106; turn the page, 121 1 Bravo, plus 336, minus 0663, 190 25 20 3005; 122 1 Alpha, plus 303, minus 0660 192 07 02 3445; 123 4 Alpha, plus 312, minus 1632 194 43 50 3198; 124 4 Bravo, plus 336, minus 1630 196 25 35 2993; 125 4 Alpha, plus 312, minus 1632 198 07 06 3221; 126 3 Bravo, plus 337, plus 1490 199 25 49 2998; with a pitch trend of minus 0.64 and yaw trim of minus 0.94.
Okay, Dave. Two corrections. Under Delta-V C in the first block, it's 3515.
Okay. 3515 for 119 1 Bravo.
Okay. Under the second block, 120 1 Bravo, time of ignition is 188 42 36.
Okay. 188 42 36.
Roger. And that's - block data confirmed.
Alrighty. Thank you. We're charging the B and we have inverter 3 Off and the H2 fan is off.
Okay. Very good. And I've got a string of plan updates here for you, at your convenience.
Okay. Stand by again.
Okay. Go ahead with the flight plan updates.
All right. Let's start at 186 10 and delete the H2 purge heaters On. To go along with the at that 196 30, delete the H2 purge.
Okay. 186 10 - and say again the other time.
Okay, 186 30, delete H2 purge.
Okay. 186 30.
Okay. Now, these are all additions. At 186 we'd like to do a P51 using the COAS option, and then a P52 to REFSMMAT.
Hey, would you believe that we were all set to do that? How about that, you were thinking right with us all the time, Stu.
Well, you know I'd like to take credit for that but we've got to admit we picked up your idea via the DSE.
Oh, you fellows are clever.
Well, I would have liked to have just kept mum, but I'm an honest guy.
Oh, you're such a good guy.
Okay. And we'd like to have your torqueing angles on that. Okay. Now at 188 25...
Okay.
We'll do a P52 to NOMINAL, and your T-align is 190 33 00.
Okay. 188 25, P52 to NOMINAL, 190 30 00.
Okay. At 189 34, we'll have some SO65 photos.
Oh, very well. SO65 and 189 34.
Roger. And we'll have your update and so forth later on. And then at 191 25, we want to do a P52 realign to NOMINAL and your T-align of that is 192 00 00.
191 25, P52, realign to NOMINAL at 192 00 00.
Okay. And now the next question is - You know, they're wanting to photograph waste water dump from the ground, and one of the windows we have is right around 192. But that's also during an SO65 photography, and we'd just like to have your comment on this. If you have any doubts about it, we don't want to do the waste water dump.
Yes. Stu, I don't think we can do that and still take pictures. It's not going to interfere; we have enough guys to do it, but the deal is can we get enough for a roll of pictures.
Roger. Jim, you got Jim, you got a lot of static in the background. Yes, that was my opinion too. Let's just forget the waste water dump; we'll catch that some other time.
Okay. We'll see if we can get it in some nonconflicting period.
Roger. And we've got about 3 minutes here. We're going to have pretty bad COMM, let me finish these updates when we pick you up at the Canaries, about in 3 minutes
Okay. Apollo 9, Houston. Hey de you read me?
Five-by.
Okay. We've got real good COMM again now. Okay. You ready to continue with some updates?
Oh, very well. We're ready. Go.
Okay. At 192 00, we will uplink you the desired orientation, and at 192 55 we'd like to have an alignment to that preferred option.
Okay. Understand. At 192 00 you'll give us an uplink with the desired, and we'll align to it at 192 55.
Okay. And the reason behind all that is, at 193 08 we'd like to do an S-band high-gain antenna test.
How about that. Okay. At 193 08 we'll try out that big antenna.
Okay. And at 193 35 we'll also have an S-band high-gain antenna test.
Okay. 193 35, S-band.
Okay. 194 27, a P52, NOMINAL option T-align, 195 plus 00 plus 00.
Roger. 194 27, P52 NOMINAL, 195 00 00.
Okay. And at 195 plus 10, we'll have some P22 landmark tracking. And we can kick this around now or later. We're getting all the details, but basically we're going to disable the 121 alarm so you will not get it. We do have them trying to drum us up some body rates that correspond to that six-tenth CDU rate that JIM asked for the other day, which we have seemed to find yet. Also, we're having them look into what the program will do with it if we do Mark, even though you don't get that alarm. But we can hassle with that later.
Okay. Very good. Thank you. 195 10 for P22.
Roger. And at 197 00, we'll power down the spacecraft.
Okay. Power down at 197 00.
Okay At 197 10, we'd like to get a radiation survey through your pass across the Atlantic at that time. And I've got a couple of procedures on that meter that got stuck down on the G&N signal conditioning panel somewhere. I guess - Is that the same one you all took into the LM that we saw on TV?
Roger. It is.
Okay. And what we'd like to have at this time would be to place the range switch to 0 to 0.1 REV's per hour, and place the snub switch to Off and obtain the peak dose rate and time of occurrence between GET of 197 plus 23 and 197 plus 33 from one of the couch positions.
Okay. Understand. Set the range to 0 to 0.1, the snub Off, obtain peak dose and time during the period 197 23 to 197 33.
That's affirmative. That's all our updates at this time. We would like to get a report from you on your SO65 frames remaining, the 70mm and 16mm films remaining, and anything about the targets of opportunity you photographed yesterday that you feel you haven't told us.
Okay. Stand by.
And I'd like to have your S-band volume up at this time. We'll be going over to Madrid in about a minute.
Okay.
We'll give you the photo stuff in a little bit. We're coming over the top of apogee here, and we wanted to see if we could get some pictures.
Real good. And I show you just about making land fall. I'll stop talking to you. About the only thing else we'd like to get from you would be a crew status report at your convenience; we can do it as you come back around.
Okay. Very well.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS Madrid; Carnarvon at 45.
Roger. Carnarvon at 45.
It's over Mediterranean like, isn't it?
Now, we're flying down pretty low.
I thought I saw a
This stereo won't fit.
It's not that big. Gibraltar
It's not that big.
It's big.
Great!
Look in here, Dave (laughter).
Always learn a little -
Hey, would you get settled down and take four of them?
Oh, there's the Moon on the horizon. Want a picture of that?
No, we don't want any.
Hey, we're really moving you know it?
Looks like a in the middle of the desert.
Hey, do we get to see Tobruk or El Alamein...
No, that's along here, but I'm not sure that we can really see it.
Oh, boy.
Okay, there's - Here comes Cairo, you see the Nile delta right there.
I can't see any water
See that - Look out that center hatch there. You ought to be able to see it coming. There's two b{g black V.
I don't know
I could have a vertical over here.
cultivated area.
I was ready for a V down there.
We're bound to have a vertical at Cairo
Get - get Cairo right here. What is it?
Cairo's over there?
Cairo's right below me.
Huh?
yes, and all over it
I don't know, but
Boy, that's really, really pretty.
Well, where was it, right at the tip of the V there, Dave?
Yes, right at the tip of the V. That's Cairo.
Yes, that's Cairo.
Alexandria is out on the coast; it sticks out on a little piece of land.
Hey, Dave.
Whooee!
Hey, we need a roll, Jim.
That's what I'm doing.
Man, look at the rate. 0.6 of a degree per second.
That was pretty neat, wasn't it?
Yes, it - that really was. You could see
There too many clouds out today; I'm really surprised.
too plentiful at Cairo.
Huh?
Did you go over Cairo before? Hey, we did?
Yes, that
What?
We went right over it.
Hey, next time we're going to be way off to the side of it, looks like.
That was pretty.
Boy, we're really pitching.
Yes, we really are. I put a little of that in it, but then it put the rest of it in by itself.
Time to go take a look at the optics.
where we are.
see if I can Hey, I haven't done anything yet, really, Rusty, purging-wise.
We're not suposed to purge the H2 tanks.
Yes, we did that last night.
Yes, boy. Here.
I wonder why it's so different? One day you get a lot, and the next day you don't get hardly any.
There is more land out to the left and the right.
It's hot in here
Yes; it sort of is.
Yes.
I can't see a thing.
The water.
going back.
I hate to spend all that fuel to stop those things. They're really ripping around there. There's some more land. India.
Pretty, isn't it?
Rusty, I still have your COMM. your COMM.
Right. Oh, there's not much there - We've - A lot of pictures have been taken of it. I guess we - we ought to probably take an Indian picture, too. Why don't we take one?
Those cotton-picking rates are building instead of damping.
What?
They're building again!
Why don't you take one of Ceylon?
I don't even think I can see it right now.
Okay.
Ready to do P51?
Yes.
How we want to bring it up?
Huh?
How do I...
What?
how do you want to do the P51?
You're going to do a P51 COAS alignment, aren't you?
Yes.
Why don't you just do it then?
Okay. Ready for the IMU?
No, wait a second; I'm not. Let me get it.
right up here.
Yes, shoot, Dave, every time you turn it on.
Coming on. Waiting for a No Attitude light, I think.
Looks like you're going to just have to hit that yaw with a pulse.
Well, listen, why not - Let's try to keep going, until it gets us to an attitude where
Be careful of the gimbal lock.
Yes. One's right over here? here.
I don't see it.
No way. It doesn't look like the rates are building.
No, they're staying pretty much the same now. I think we can take it out.
Okay.
Okay, over here?
Let me unplug
You're probably going to put that around - Here it is, right up here. Have I got a what?
Now we'll get to see how good a COAS calibration is after 5 days.
I know what I'll do; I'll
No! do that.
What?
Do
(Laughter) Don't do that.
Did you find the flight plan anyplace?
I never looking.
Me neither.
Here, Rusty. There, that's for you.
Does it belong over here?
No,
By the way, we're coming off the end over here.
That's where that belongs, Dave, is under one of those window things.
Is it really? Oh, shoot!...
So, one's got to be loose.
One of those window things is loose. This one right here.
Will it go on?
Well, there's a bolt; I - I put a bolt...
No. That was the wrong bolt.
Well, are you sure, Dave? I'm not sure I found the same bolt.
I found it. It's all here.
Okay, except for this -
Except for what you got there. Whoo! It's a good thing you recognized what that was.
Yes, I put one together the other day.
Are those tight over there?
Yes, I just tightened them. They weren't.
No, still daylight.
through logging, I want you to start on the SO 65.
Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
Roger. You're five-square. Good morning.
Good morning, Rusty.
It's a beautiful day over Africa. How is it in Houston?
Well, I don't know. It's still dark out, at least it was when I came in. it's a little chilly. We've been having some cold weather.
Buy, I'm glad we chose this time of year to take our vacation!
Yes, you're missing - You're missing all the cold weather here. It'll nice and balmy when you get back. This should end - the leaves are budding out, you know; of course, it's springtime, but it's cold.
We can take a crew status report any time you'd like to give it to us.
Houston, this is the CDR, here. I only got 7 hours sleep last night; I took one Actifed.
Roger. I copy that.
half and one Actifed.
Say your hours of sleep again, Rusty.
Yes. That's 6-1/2.
Okay.
By the way, just out of curiosity, can you tell any difference in the quality of the voice between, Dave and I or Jim and I?
You're coming through real good. Let's have Jim say something else, here.
Rodger, Houston. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or something else.
Okay. That's not quite as clear as Rusty's transmission.
I believe it sounded like Dave wanted to say something, and I couldn't hear it at all.
Oh, okay. How about mine now?
You isn't quite as clear. It's a little mushy, but of the three, Rusty's is the best.
Okay. This is Rusty. I'm wearing a bunny hat, and the other two are wearing lightweights. We were just kind of curious.
Oh, well. It looks like we got a data point. Hey, Jim, for you - For your info, the weather looks - shaping up real well for Thursday morning. Looks like it's going to pretty good.
Oh. that's fine and dandy! Stu, you do good work.
We'll, can't say anything yet. I mean, when I say pretty good, that was compared to what I - what I gave yesterday. Officially, we're forecasting 2000 feet, scattered, variable, broken, 10 miles vis, winds 300 degrees at 15 knots, the seas about 4 to 5 feet with a few higher swells.
Well, keep working on it. That's not down to my specifications yet.
Yes, sir; that's in work, and could we get a CMP sleep report?
Roger. I had about 6-1/2 hours and had no pills.
Roger. Copy.
Oh, listen; one other thing we should throw in there: we each had a vitamin pill yesterday.
Okay. Very good. One vitamin; staying healthy.
And. Houston, we've taken 85 frames of SO 65 so far.
Very good. Thank you.
And, at your convenience, we'd like to know how much 70mm and 16mm film you've got.
Roger. On the 70 millimeter, we've got roughly 200 frames left.
Very good.
And, Dave, a question just personal - on curiosity here: I was wondering if anybody had tried the D-meter looking at the ground targets and so forth - how they showed up in that.
No, we haven't tried it yet, but we're going to probably get around to it, here, one of these days. That's a good idea.
And, Apollo 9. Just another thing while we've got a minute to chit chat - on curiosity. I noticed the cabin temp running down 66, 69, and so forth. Do you not feel cool at that, when you're sleeping, or do you sleep pretty warm?
Gee, as a matter of fact that's a little warm around 70. I think that's our general feeling.
Stu, with the cabin fan not running that's really the temperature of the cabin sensor, only. It's a little hard to tell exactly what the temperature of the cabin is, but if we turn the cabin fan on, we noticed the other day, that it jumps up a few degrees. So I guess that the cabin fan - I mean the temperature sensor is located in a spot that's a little cooler than the main cabin.
Oh, very good. Thank you.
Guess if you wanted a fairly honest reading, we could turn the cabin fan on for a second and let it get up there and turn it back off again.
No. No, that's no problem. I was just thinking of you sleeping with that temperature. I was just curious whether you thought it was cold or not.
It kinda depends on where the hose outlets are, whether you're cold or warm during the night.
Roger.
And, if you, would, bring up your S-band volume, please.
Okay. Apollo 9, Houston. I've got you through Honeysuckle. Did I get your S-band volume up?
Sure did.
Oh, very good.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. We're recommending that Charlie roll be ENABLED and Delta roll DISABLED.
Roger. Charlie ENABLED, and Delta DISABLED on the roll.
And, Rusty, Houston. At your convenience, you might push on your BIOMED sensors; we're getting a little erratic data.
Any particular one?
Roger. Your chest - We're getting the EKG's jumping all over.
How about now? Do they settle down any?
No, it's - It's not, it's really going wild. Must either be - If it's not moved it must be a bad sensor.
Either that, or my heart.
Man, I hope not
No, I have an idea that electro tape is dried out. It - The ground feels a little bit scratchy right now.
Okay. Copy. And ya'll impress me with your wealth of knowledge coming up with statements like that.
I'm afraid Dr. Scott used all the electro dumps.
I see.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. Just another curious question, if you've got the time. When you dump the waste water, does it hang around the spacecraft for a long time, or do you - does it - Can you see the particles, or do they dissipate pretty easily?
You can see them all right, especially at sunset and sunrise. They really shoot out of there with pretty high velocity, and it's kind of interesting behavior. Most of them disappear over the hill rapidly, but it looks as though it continues to sputter and spurt out of the duct there for quite a while, after you've completed the dump. I'm not sure how long it continues that way, but for quite a while. When you're watching the particles go away, strangely enough, it looks like some of them either collide or something. We haven't figured out what, yet, but occasionally one of them will come back past us for a little while.
Good grief! Have you got some pictures of those?
Yes.
Good. We're going to have an early LOS here at Honeysuckle, and we'll see you Mercury 05.
Roger.
And, Apollo 9, this is Houston through the Mercury. And I want to volunteer a map update here before my friendly CDR zaps me.
Okay. Stand by. I'll get something to copy it.
Okay.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. It's REV 118, which you're on now; time, 187 24 55; longitude, 108 degrees west.
Okay. 187 24 55, 108 west.
That's affirmative.
And I copy your star angle difference and your torqueing angles, there, Apollo 9.
Roger. And I'll run a quick sextant realignment on REFSMMAT to see what kind of accuracy we got out of this.
I missed that, Dave. Say again.
I say I'll hop down and run a sextant realignment now on REFSMMAT to see what kind of accuracy we got out of the COAS.
Oh, very good. And I take it the telescope worked okay yesterday. Did it hang up at all with you?
No, yesterday was clean day. Wasn't one glitch all day.
Did you do anything, or did it just go away?
No, apparently it just worked itself out. Perhaps there, was something on the outside from the LM thrusters or something, but it seems to have worked itself out.
Very good.
Apollo c Houston. Forty seconds LOS Mercury; see you Texas, 30.
Okay. Let's get rid of that thing.
Okay.
Jimmy, why don't you -
I come through the middle to Huh?
What are you doing, Jim?
Using the They're really neat!
There's you a wake-up card.
Roger.
Looks like that alignment.
Auto optics has got as error.
Yes.
Flashing 51.
Do you do that when you go to MANUAL?
Yes.
34, Atria. Okay.
Flashing 51.
sloppy! Oh!
That's not too had.
Yes, that's a pretty good alignment...
Not bad.
with the COAS, you know it?
Yes.
Don't sweat the telescope.
Within 0.1 of a degree.
Let's see what the sextant readability is.
Old hydrogen really came out balanced after last night, you know it?
Yes, man, right on the money.
It's about a percent different now.
I've still got to get the logging done.
You got to get what?
I still want to log this
Oh, hell! Old water bag got wiped off.
Oh, I saw it floating around down there underneath the seat a little while ago.
Yes, we're getting down to the section now, where we're going to have to start adding heat to that hydrogen tank.
Whee! That's pretty good. You're just going to reject those, huh?
all these
Yes, but I mean - you're not going to torque it, are you? Because it was with the telescope, instead of the sextant.
No, no, it's the sextant.
Oh, that was the sextant. Oh, I thought you were doing the telescope to compare it.
No, why don't I?
Well, what was the one you just did before that?
Sextant.
So you just can't have a repeatable sextant...
Why don't I do one with the telescope then? I think that would be a fine idea. all the way around
and just reject the ones with the telescope?
Yes. The Earth is getting there.
Yes, reject the ones with the telescope...
Okay, I'm going to roll for you, Davey.
Okay.
0hoo! We're looking backward. Boy, that was confusing. I was looking out the window trying to figure out "What am I seeing there?"
That's funny, because I think I can see something out there. I can see Acrux. Oh, the Earth, that's right. It's between the Earth and the spacecraft. Oh, boy.
That's pretty soon.
Yes. I can see them - I don't know why it looks - I got Acrux down there. Hmm, the Sun is showing up, too. I didn't quite get Atria. It's coming in, though. Okay. I guess we ought to have it, now. Come on, computer; I can see Atria. Don't give me that. your sextants? How about that, smart Smart telescope. Telescope, you see it, and sextants?
Jim, I tell you what - Yes, if you pitch down -
What's our first event?
Okay, Jim, I got one.'
You've got one?
Yes.
Are you looking at that rate?
Yes.
Everything's
Oh, I - I can't handle it, Jim. I'm going to stop and
Oh, goody, another one. I wonder where that one's from? We're coming apart at the seams, here.
What a star! For daytime! Oh, boy!
Really put you to the test.
Yes. Now we got all those little things floating out, too.
(Laughter)
Yes, you're right, it is.
How - how are your rates, Jim?
Zero.
Are they really?
Must be tracking along pretty nice.
Yes.
I'd like to give you a one-roll shot, but I think I'll just go overboard. I'll give you one roll.
Okay.
How's your schnoz?
Really stopped up right now.
Oh, look at that! Worse in the telescope than the COAS! That's something. Well, I can't see...
Texas, voice net-2. No, we don't. Texas, voice net-2.
Get off the air, net-2.
Look at that.
Well, still better in the COAS.
I won't torque these.
Apollo 9, Houston. Standing by.
Roger. Apollo 9.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Dave, the COMM here is real bad. Let's hold off for about 2 minutes. I couldn't copy.
Understand that we will not torque the angles
Okay.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. We have a state vector for you, if you would give us P00 and ACCEPT, please.
You have P00 in ACCEPT.
Understand.
Apollo 9, Houston. We'd like to turn the fan on in H2 tank 1 at this time, please.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. How do you read now?
You're coming in five-square, Houston.
Okay, Apollo 9. VERB 66 has been entered. The computer is yours, and I have a NAV check to go along with that vector.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. Reading NAV check: 186 30 00, minus 3329. plus 13537 2294.
Okay. Understand. 188 30 00, minus 3329, plus 13537 2294.
Roger. Readback is correct, and it looks like we ought to have an answer here shortly.
Here's your answer.
And, Houston, 9. Let me give you some of this data from the COAS. I think you might find it interesting.
Roger. I'm ready to copy. I can read you okay now, Dave.
Okay. I'll just give you the GET and the gyro torqueing angles and tell you what instrument we used. Okay?
All right.
Okay. The first one's the COAS, and I used the calibration that I made during the rendezvous, 5 days ago. The COAS has been in and out about, oh I guess, four or five times since then. The star angle - The GET was 187 14 30. The gyro torqueing angles were minus 00080, minus 00013, and plus 00183.
Hey, that sounds beautiful, Dave. That's real good.
the star-angle difference on that was 0.03.
And on the sextant, which was the next torqueing we did, the GET was 187 19 00, and the torqueing angles were plus 00073, plus 00060, minus 00084. The star-angle difference on that was 0.01.
Roger, Dave. I copy all those. Boy, that COAS bombed through there, didn't it?
Yes, then I did another to see what the 's were all the way down, so I have another sextant for you: 187 24 00. The gyro torqueing angles were plus 4 balls 3, minus 3 balls 25, and plus 4 balls 2; which sort of says the sextant's pretty good, which we already know. The star-angle difference on that was 0.01.
Roger. Copy. Very interesting.
Okay. Then not to neglect our friendly telescope, the Sun was coming up but I tried to get a telescope alignment, also, but I think we sort of lost out a little bit because my second star was Menkent, and it was pretty dim. I had a tough time seeing it, so we did not torque the platforms, but I'll give you the data anyway. The time was 187 31 00. Gyro torqueing angles were minus 0070, plus 00169, minus 00133. The star-angle difference was 0.05 and I think that's because I just couldn't see Menkent when we got daylight through that telescope.
Okay. Very good.
Anyway, I think it shows there is a certain capability with that COAS.
Yes, it sure dose. That looks pretty good.
Okay. And have a couple of targets for you coming across Africa this time, if you're in a picture-taking mood.
Oh, yes. Always.
All right. Are you ready to copy?
Okay. Go ahead.
All right. The target is in Chad. It's the northeast slope of the Tibetsi Mountains. Your time for the first frame: 187 57 03. We would like to have seven pictures, at 10-second intervals, and straight down the nadir. Next target: Red Sea, 188 03 06, seven pictures, 10-seconds intervals, and right on the nadir again.
Okay. Copy the first one. 187 57 03, seven frames, 10-second intervals, on the nadir; and 188 03 06, seven frames, 10-second intervals, on the nadir again.
That's affirmative, Apollo 9.
Okay.
Houston, we have a little discrepancy on our map there. According to the map update this REV does not take us over Chad. We cross north of it in Libya. I wonder if it's right.
Roger. I copy. Apollo 9 the map might be off just a little bit here due to orbital parameter. Let me get the details on that.
Rusty, I'm looking at the map here also, and I agree with you. I think we must have something wrong on our first update.
Okay. It looks like we may get the Rea Sea one in there, just the southern end of the Red Sea.
Roger. I see that.
Well, Rusty, we're working that out. I'll have to take a gotcha because I didn't check that against the map before I passed it to you.
You think that first one was a bad one?
Yes, I think it was, and I did not check it on my map before I sent it up to you, so you've got me.
Didn't mean to do that, but I did want to get it straight.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead. Houston, Apollo 9.
Okay, Jim. I've run that first target out on the map here, and I would believe 30 degrees south of the nadir which is the information that we have now. I don't know the Tibetsi Mountains by first name, and they're not listed; but there is that mountain range right there where you'll be at that time. So the time and the frame stay the same. Shoot it 30 degrees south of the nadir.
Okay; fine. And be advised we have about two and one-third rolls of 16mm outdoor film left. We want to save one roll for re-entry.
Roger. Copy. Two and one-third rolls 16mm and saving one.
Jim, these targets of opportunity - I'm planning on just passing them to you at convenient time until you holler Uncle, so if we start giving you too much just say so.
Okay. We're picking up the ones we can get to easiest and it's sort of a random process.
Roger. Understand.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. I was guilty of slighting someone on my flight plan update: under the comments, it was good morning from your smiling flight planners.
Say that one again, Houston; we just missed it.
Roger. We'll see you over Carnarvon about 20. We're going to lose you here at Honeysuckle - I mean at Madrid within a minute.
Okay, Houston. We want to report on another failure. Last night the exerciser failed.
Roger. Understand the exerciser failed. Who do we give credit for being so strong they busted it?
Oh, I'm beginning to get some, Jim. Yes, keep rolling - you're rolling left, huh? Oh, that - You'll be in good shape.
Rusty broke it.
Okay.
Yes, but we won't be looking north - Well, maybe if we
If you roll left - You're pointed clear right to the ground, see?
Yes, but you're pitching the wrong way - It almost looks like -
yaw, too.
get to Galveston on me.
You got something? We - we're about 4 minutes from the Mountains, or whatever it is.
No,
See?
Obliquely.
Lots of sand dunes.
Yes.
Where are we on the map? Did we figure that out?
Yes.
Oh, right here. Hey, we're going across to the "Lady, Be Good" site.
And, that desert right down there -
How would you like to have to walk 400 miles across that, huh?
You know what the - the crushing thing about the story was?
What?
They got to a bunch of dunes, that looked exactly like the dunes on the shore of the Mediterranean.
Yes.
Then, they really sprinted.
Oh!
You know, they thought, "We're there, we're there," you know. They got up over the dunes, and that's where they started falling off. Klonk, klonk, klonk. And they only then had another 300...
Jim, you're going to be looking south.
Yes.
Hey, I think I see...
geology down there.
Hey, this part of Africa's sort of the place in the world.
Except, maybe the North and South Pole.
Oh, look over here. Golly, look at that, Jim. Coming on it in 55 minutes, Jim.
How you looking over there?
I'm not looking
You're not, huh? Great. I'm going to take one of that, there.
How many have we got allocated for today?
Let's take some of Africa
We didn't in other parts of the world.
I really missed
Oh, there's cinder cones down there.
Big cinder cones, yes. Golly, that's a beauty. Do you see it, Rusty?
Yes.
straight down here on the - Is that what you're talking about?
Yes.
Yes, right there. That's a beauty, isn't it?
Yes.
See anything else?
No. But we've got a minute away from the mountains. What time are the mountains?
They were on - they were 57 a little bit ago...
57 something. Look south of the nadir, Jim, 30 degrees. Do you see anything? Did you see anything?
I could see pretty good south of the nadir, I think.
So could I. I could - I could see real well around to the south, but I don't see anything good enough to take pictures of.
There's another good piece of geology. Rusty's been waiting - waiting to take pictures.
Hey, let me - let me take one picture...
Yes.
Well! Well, no...
Yes.
Boy, that cinder cone is pretty. What...
How's the Red Sea up there?
The Red Sea is at - 188:03:06.
What time is it now?
We've got about 5 minutes to go. We're about upside down, alright?
Yes, it would be great to stop the roll
Boy, here's another interesting piece. You - you reckon two shots will give them the stereo that they're looking for?
Not - not two shots aimed at the same direction - I mean, at the same point.
Yes.
I think most of these things - that - by way out here - are just one shot good, Dave. I think that something around the United States and Mexico, where they can get to and survey and do something with, they need stereo, but this stuff way out here, they just want a picture of it. You can - you can see an impact down there that...
Yes.
Just like the lava on the Moon.
Oh, we was impact or not, though.
Oh, of course, all...
All circular features are impacts!
All circular features are impacts!
That's pretty good - pretty good geologist. Maybe he could get the - Australia, if he's a geologist.
Oh course. Sure like to get out there and see that nice big crater.
That would be interesting. Not too many people get...
The Nile River.
I do believe.
What's this?
Let's see where we are. We may be right down - that's right, we're going right by Khartoum. That's - We're about at Khartoum right now; and that's where the Nile joins - the White Nile and the Blue Nile...
White Nile and the Blue Nile comes together, there.
That's right. That's right where we're going over, isn't it? Oh, what time is it?
Good, that's - We should be a little bit south of track; so, it ought to be down my side, here. Let's see if I can see it.
South? That should be on Jim's side.
Oh, south is on Jim's side. That's right. Okay.
Look at the striation.
Is that a good word?
Look at the what?
Striation.
Is that a good word?
Oh, yes.
Good word, yes?
Good word. That's not right, but it's a good word.
Alstrait (laughter).
Jim, do you see Khartoum down there, yet?
I think it's up ahead to the left there. Yes.
morphic granulate down there, too.
Now, you've gone too far.
Okay, this one is...
Is that it, Jim? Down to the left, there?
No,
I don't see anything at all. Should it be south of track, Rusty?
Yes. It should be south of track, it should be right at the junction of the two rivers.
Junction. Two rivers. Now this is the Blue Nile under us, I think. Isn't the Blue Nile farther to the east?
Hey, give me - Let me take a picture...
To the what?
To the east?
take a picture of the junction of the two rivers.
That blue's pretty.
Yes. I think that's the Blue Nile.
There we go. Look at the cultivation on the river there?
Yes. And there's some right up ahead here, too, almost on track.
Hey, we're going to be pretty good at this...
The greenest looking fields I've seen.
Seven frames at 10 seconds, We're going to be in good shape to do that.
Hey, I'm not sure we want to take those. Oh, of what?
Not the - the Red Sea.
The Red Sea. Oh, yes, let's take the Red Sea. Look at this cultivation down there...
Yes, that's what I was going to say. That's the - those are the best looking fields I've seen. That looks like home, doesn't it? A lot of them. Wonder what those other things are that aren't green, but look like they're...
Oh, they're brown fields.
No, but they look different; you know, like it's a special kind of crop or something. Oh, we're getting into some - rocky stuff, now.
Say, why don't you call when 10 seconds comes up, Rusty?
Yes, okay.
03:06 is the beginning.
Okay, and you're going to take them straight out.
Yes, I'll take them straight down.
Okay. 03:06. You got about 1 minute.
Alright.
And I'll just give you a mark every 10 seconds, and we want seven up; right?
Yes.
Oh, the're going to go away, though. Looks - They're not too bad.
Yes, and as soon as we get over this one, your lights come hack on in. It gets good again.
Yes.
Okay, stand by. It's about 15 seconds...
Yes. You ought to start counting, Dave, if you see that lake down there.
Okay. Oh, that little lake?
Yes.
Rusty, start the count.
Okay You just take one.
Yes, I took - over that lake.
Okay. I'll just give you another mark in 10 seconds, here.
Okay.
3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Geepers, just...
Works pretty good, though.
down there.
Oh, this is going to be great. 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Number 3.
Look at those big craters, down there.
Yes.
3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Number 4.
Keep taking them straight down, because you don't get a hair as much reflected, nearly as much.
3, 2, 1 -
Great!
MARK.
Man, that is great!
3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Okay, have I got one more here?
Yes.
3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Okay, that's one more than they asked for.
Is it really?
Yes.
That looks pretty good.
No, I'm sorry. It wasn't. Hey, take one more here.
3, 2, 1 -
Take a picture over there, Dave...
Okay.
Whooee - Oh, yes - Hey, take a picture over the right, Rusty. That's the part that I was telling you about.
Yes. Alright.
I think that was a pretty good strip.
Yes. Except you were pulling up a little bit, instead of steering out the window. You're - And that window is almost perpendicular to the...
You're drive...
your angle to the window.
try to angle straight to the ground.
Yes. Yes, I know. You can tell out the side window. It's almost - We were almost in the SO 65 attitude. That's okay. They can't tell the difference - 10 degrees.
Okay, okay. Now we're coming back across the...
How far...
peninsula.
How far off of the times were we, Rusty?
No, we were right on it.
Oh, okay.
Okay, we're coming across Somaliland.
Somaliland - How about stopping and get a tamale?
Boy, wouldn't that be good?
Sure would.
Anything with some seasoning right now would really taste good.
What's that island out there? Oh. Oh, yes, I remember that one.
That's it right there. I never even heard of it before.
Oh, you haven't beard of that,?
Oh, Rusty, Rusty. Oh, that's right.
Hey, you have Andes on time. Did you?
Yes, isn't that something to give the time - to be out the old timeline? Poor Australia, we never get to see it in the daytime.
Well, that wasn't a bad strip either, was it?
I'll be damned.
What do we have ahead of us now, Rusty? out in the water somewhere.
Yes, we're out in the middle of the Indian Ocean right now. The only thing out there is - the Chagos Archipelago out - almost on our track, which is - I guess, a bunch of reefs out in the middle of the Indian Ocean.
Hey, we checked right out that time. Zero roll, VERB 55.
Great!
Now, listen, you knew that (laughter).
Yes.
And on your le...
(Laughter)
to your left is the Chagos Archipelago. To the right, the island of
What?
What number was that?
Grape - Hey, grape and hot chocolate in the same package. Man, I am going to have that for breakfast. Boy, Rusty that breakfast.
No, I gave Dave my hot chocolate.
Golly, why didn't you drink? Rusty, take a few in North Africa.
This is sausage. How was that sausage yesterday?
Pretty good. And if I say it's pretty good...
It must be pretty good!
Hey, here's - here's cocoa - Hey, here's really a meal. Cocoa, grape, sausage, peaches, and bacon. Want that?
No, I'm going to have that tomorrow.
We already got it all dug out here.
Yes, I know. Well, with our luck, we may not be here tomorrow.
I think we will be, unless for some reason, - That's day 8, meal C, right? Day 8, meal A, I mean.
I see you changed the paper bag already.
When there aren't any more meals like that, you know we don't have enough meals for What else do you have over there stashed away?
Huh?
What else do you have over there stashed away?
Here.
No - Eat it. No, no, I was only kidding. I was just opening this to put in the bag.
Which one - which one - Is this the one we're putting in? the old grab bag.
Is it up there in the tunnel, maybe?
Oh, here it is. Here you go.
Oh, yes, we got to get open, too.
Oh, shit, oh dear part of the
Great.
How you doing there, sport?
Okay, well, I guess I'll go continue to dump some water.
Good idea.
Hey, what's that?
That's land.
Is that land?
Where?
Up ahead of us there, to the north part of it.
Or, are those low brown clouds?
Yes.
Maybe we ought to take a second look at them when we get up there. It might be cloud.
If it's land, it's called - Australia.
Oh, yes.
Hey!
It's got to be dark there.
daylight, I really do. Are we going over Australia this pass?
Yes. Sure are.
looks like
Australia is pretty.
over on our last pass, too, though.
We sure don't have two grapefruits
Probably don't. I yesterday.
breakfast yesterday.
Oh, really?
Yes.
Let me see. It's 1 hour past the update should be there; give you some idea of whether - it should be - 188:05. Oh, no. We've got 11 minutes to go until we get to Australia. Our pass is going to be black.
already.
Let's see; I guess - you want me to continue to dump some water?
Yes.
I didn't use much of your gas on that alignment.
Good.
This is more than using the optics, though.
Oh, yes.
It's difficult to articulate the COAS.
Yes, it is. It's awfully difficult to articulate the optics.
True, if you don't remove the damn thing.
It's a job to articulate...
Oh, you're just
I wasn't through with it. I got to get an alignment this pass, Rusty. Okay?
Whatever you say.
Oh, I really hate to do this.
southeast of is suppose to do put it in your pocket.
Well, where was that water bag? There should be an empty bag up here, Dave, that I was fixing to damp that water. See it up there?
No, I sure don't.
Here you are. Let's get the
Well, doggone it.
Hey, here's a meal that came floating over here.
Good.
Day 4, meal C. There it is, Dave. How about grabbing it for me, will you?
Where?
That bag, right there.
Day 4, meal C? How could - how come we still happen to have that around?
Probably got a glue on it.
Yes. As a matter of fact -
Have you tasted the water to see if it has still got the chlorine in it?
No, you want to taste it?
Yes. I'll be glad to. I'll fix me something to drink.
Alright.
I'm thirsty and I'm hungry.
I tell you, all you got to do is take a tissue or a rag, if you've got a clean tissue, and put some water in it and smell it.
smell a pipe.
Look at that. We got two big bags. Whew!
Looks like - it looks like we don't want...
Give me a drink, David, and I'll...
Okay.
I think we also ought to get out the other
Why don't you - Let's put that one down in the food box.
Let me find one that is palatable. Oh, hey, here's another one.
How about an orange juice? There's more orange drink than anything else.
Good.
I wish there was more grapefruit drink. I hate this other
is screwed up.
Really?
grape drink or grape
I think they're a little better now. But I ate the orange and they're a pretty close second.
That's right right of rockers if you call this...
You know what would be a better idea?
What?
Take all the spaghetti's oranges throw it in into the food locker and
Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
Hello, Houston, this is Apollo 9. We hear you loud and clear.
Roger. You're coming in real good. And the SO65 on this REV over Africa has been cancelled due to weather. The one on the next revcoming up will still hold, however.
Okay; very good. Yes, Africa has a lot of clouds over it these days that series of photos along the end of the Red Sea. They show up pretty.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We'd like to turn the fans off in H2 tank 1. We're going to let the pressure drop down during the day. Be looking at it around 190, we hope.
Oh. Very good. Fans are off in tank 1.
And, Rusty, when you got a chance, we'd like to have you check your BIOMED leads going into your blue signal conditioner.
Okay. I'll give that a check right now. Would you say it again? The blue what, please?
The blue signal conditi - Hey, I couldn't say it the second time, either. I give up.
Okay. I want to ask you again.
That little blue box down there.
Roger!
Houston, I think that the blue leads are all right. Did you - Were you reading me okay last night just before we all sacked out?
That's affirmative, Rusty.
Okay. I think it's just the sensors.
Okay. We're getting short bursts of good data and then long periods of erratic data.
And, Apollo 9, we'd like to have your S-band volume up. We'll be going over to Honeysuckle in about 20 seconds.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston with a couple of targets of opportunity.
Stand by one.
Roger.
Okay. Go ahead.
The first one is Cape Kennedy: time 189 plus 10 plus 23; shoot three frames, 12-second exposures; should be right on the nadir. Next target: Bermuda, 189 plus 14 plus 07; three frames, 12-second intervals; and that's going to be real close to the nadir. Might be about a mile off.
Okay. Cape Kennedy: 189 10 23; three frames, dump T of 12 seconds. Bermuda: 189 14 07; three frames, dump T 12 seconds. Both on the nadir.
That's affirmative, Apollo 9.
Houston?
Go ahead, Apollo 9. Houston here.
How's the cloud cover down there today around Texas?
I haven't been out since it's been daylight, Rusty; let me check, here. I understand there's broken clouds in our area.
Okay.
And we'll see you Mercury 40.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston through the Mercury. Standing by.
Roger...
Roger, Houston, this is Apollo 9. Got some gyro torqueing angles, if you want them.
I am ready to copy.
Okay. GET of 188 29 00, plus 00827, plus 00098, plus 01792.
Roger. Would you read me the third one again please, Dave?
Roger. Plus 01792. And that was to a nominal alignment. We course-aligned, and that's why you get the big number there.
Okay. I just wanted to make sure I was getting it right. Thank you.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston. One minute LOS Mercury; Redstone 57.
Roger.
Roger, Houston.
Anybody want part of a bacon?
Okay, good, I'll split it with you, Dave. I'm not going to want all of it, but I need a little snack.
Okay.
Hey, we could take that and stuff it in food box? Yes, we could have an empty Never open the food box again.
someplace to put our scraps.
189:10:23.
reading the bubble.
Okay, stopped.
Huh?
Okay, the
Yes, I see it over here in the clear area.
Okay, that's got it wrong one. Now, we take this end and we go -
We do it for a minute.
There we go.
Not too bad. Delays it a little anyway.
it does it all in one spot and not on to the other unit.
If you can get rid of it that way - toward the end I can - if there isn't too much water with it, if it all comes out as gas. The capillary action kind of makes it - or something makes it stick to your mouth and the gas kind of goes in the middle.
What actually the?
Apollo 9, Houston through, Redstone. You have a GO for 136 dash 1.
Roger on the GO.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. Do you read?
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. We've got you now for a nice long pass. We'll have you until 28 or so, and I've got an SO65 update at your convenience.
Copy
Houston, ready to copy your SO65.
Roger, Apollo 9. Stand by one.
Okay. Apollo 9, Houston. SO65 update. Inertial angles: 1800 29610 0 190 37 44 190 30 00; ORB RATE. The first one is Austin: 190 42 44 10 03, and the weather over Austin has broken clouds, but we want the picture taken anyway. The next area is Charleston: 190 47 10 08 03; your ORB RATE ball, 180 327.5 0, ORB RATE 0.066, and your ORB RATE data - your VWXYZ is the same as you used yesterday. I can repeat it, if you wish; or, if you have it copied, you can use that.
Apollo 9, Houston. Do you read?
Hello, Apollo 9. How do you read Houston?
Apollo 9, Houston. Do I have you now?
Apollo 9, Houston. Do you read?
Apollo 9, Houston through Mila. How do you read?
Five-square, now.
Roger. Evidently we didn't make it at the last site. Did you get update?
The last word that I got was Charleston.
Okay. Charleston is your second sight: 190 47 10 08 03. Your ORB RATE angles: 180 327.5 0; ORB RATE: 0.066.
Roger. Do we have Victor through Zorro?
Roger. I have those. They are the same as yesterday. Would you like me to read them?
Negative. We have them.
Okay. And one other comment: as you come across on the U.S., we'd like to get some 70mm photos, northward across the U.S., out of number five window.
Roger.
We're coming across backwards and upside down, Houston.
Roger. This was in connection with the SO65 PAD.
Sorry!
But you know, I don't really think that's a requirement. If you just take us some good old pictures looking northward, there, that'll be all right.
Okay. Will you take him some good old pictures looking northward?
But as you will notice on the map, this REV 121, you get up there quite a ways. That's really the pass we want them on.
Okay. Could you tell me what time we might get over Corpus Christi? On this pass?
You should be past it. You are not too far off the west coast of Florida.
Oh yes. I can see Cape Sandblast right now. I wanted to say hello to my friends down in Refugio, but it looks like I missed them.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. Why don't you all think a little bit, today, how much in the flight plan tomorrow afternoon you would like to get squared away for reentry. We will be getting you up right on time the next two days, but we thought if you wanted, tomorrow you might want a few hours.
Yes, we have some moving around to do and we would like to be in a pretty posture for reentry when we get up on reentry morning.
Why don't you kick it around a little bit, and maybe just give us an estimate in hours that you'd like extra for tomorrow afternoon. We'll make allowance in the photo plan, and so forth.
Al righty.
And, Houston, do we have enough time for the readback on the SO65?
That's affirmative.
Okay. 18000 29610 all zips 190 3744 1903000 ORB RATE 0.066; local vertical angles, 180, 327.5, and 0. Austin: 190 42 44 10 03, weather broken but take them anyway; Charleston: 190 47 10 08 03.
That is affirmative; and your data that you load, your VWXYZ, is the same as yesterday.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston. One minute LOS; Tananarive at 42.
Hello there, young man.
Good morning.
How are you today?
Well, I'll tell you. It looks like I'm going to have to get a flight to get any sleep.
Aw, come on now. Stop picking on us!
Okay. Not really. Any excuse to get a flight, though.
Roger.
A rather interesting picture out this side.
What's out there?
It might be worth a shot. 20 - Desert with lava flow.
How are we doing angle-wise?
Boy, there's some real sand dunes down there - whew!
You know something? We look like we've been in it.
(Laughter)
Now we're pitching back down
No, I guess if we rolled left -
down at 0.4 degree per second.
Yes. Hey, I think I can see it coming, if that's Mount Kilimanjaro. You think that's the mountain up there, Jim? Out the front window? Or you think that's just a - Oh, I guess that's just a...
The one I'm looking at, that's just a cloud.
Just a cloud.
No, well, I'm not sure yet. Let me see.
This must be the South Sahara. When the world gets overpopulated, they can all come here.
Hey, Jim, you're looking down on clouds.
Really?
Can you see it through them?
Yes -
in this side.
Real light brown -
Cloudy as can be, and there's nothing that even resembles vegetation. It looks like lunar soil doesn't it?
Yes.
What?
There it is, Kilimanjaro out there. I see it, I see it!
Yes.
Over to the left, there. Is that where you were looking?
What time is it? Oh, yes...
6 minutes.
It's time, yes.
I thought I saw a big brown thing with snow, and there's supposed to be snow on that mountain. I read about it.
Oh, yes.
This actually is supposed to be where we start tracking. Right under us.
Let me get the map there, Dave.
Here, let me roll right and
He can out here.
A little bit south of track.
It's pitching around
Yes, this window is - this one is - moving around - pitch rate up to about 0.3 degree per second - 0.4-degree-per-second pitchup, and 0.4 - degree per-second pitchdown.
We're climbing, aren't we?
Yes.
Well, actually - actually, that's not a bad attitude just the way it is, Jim.
Okay. Just let it go then.
Let's see, we've got another 5 minutes - 4 - little over 4 minutes.
I see a town. I see a waterhole there.
See the old waterhole?
Over on your side is an old waterhole.
Oh, yes. Ye old waterhole.
It looks pretty cloudy.
It sure does. See, if they were just low clouds, old Kilimanjaro would stick right out of the top of them.
Pitch fate's dropping off - it's down about 0.25.
That's good.
How many more minutes?
3.
might be hole up there.
Need up there?
No, about a minute and a half.
Really doesn't look that bad.
There's water down underneath.
Yes...
Yes, we go over by Lake Victoria - lake right beside it.
Yes, there's another one right down underneath us - right now.
Yes.
Oh, boy - it's getting kind of steep.
We must be rolling to the right, too, aren't we?
Got that?
Yes - I can't - no longer see along the track.
Do you see a mountain coming up?
I don't see anything at all that resembles a mountain.
I don't either.
There's the shoreline of Africa.
Yes. I think I see the mountain out in front of us there, but it's under that cloud. Is that it, Dave? Yes, there it is. Yes, you can see the volcano. Yes.
Whereabouts?
Right straight out here.
Yes. Can you get it, Dave? Well, get the mountain and put it in the top of the field.
You get it?
Yes - Let me get one more here.
You can get one when we go over it.
I got to find the damn thing again, though. You know, I'm not sure that that's it.
Yes, it is.
Yes, that's it. Oh, yes - it's got the crater in the top, too.
Maybe I'm looking at the wrong thing. Where is it, Dave?
It's way down here.
It's back out to the right now, Jim. It's got a lot of clouds around it, but the clouds are heavy on the - the east slope of it.
Slope? Yes, that's what I was looking at. You think that's it, huh?
Yes. It's the only mountain around, Jim.
It doesn't look like a mountain to me.
Oh, yes. With snow on the top of it? You don't see much now on the ground; or didn't you think it was snow.
No, as a matter of fact, I thought it was a cloud.
Let's tell everybody it is Kilimanjaro.
(Laughter)
Oh, hell, yes, it was. That was - if it was a cloud, it had rocks sticking out the top of it. In which case it was Kilimanjaro anyway. Okay.
How would you read that number now, Dave?
It's right between two - You can't even tell what the hell it says.
You were getting ready to check 78 and 79, but I...
Yes.
Remind me. Is that yours?
And on into the Pacific!
There's a loose, near-empty, grapefruit bag floating around. I guess - It's not in front of me any longer.
When you said that one, I thought you
Whoa, baby.
Look at that gas bubble!
Yes, sure can.
Oh, those are pretty islands. Oh, shoot! This -
Oh, yes!
To the right?
Over here.
Well - I don't think we can still get them.
Yes.
Way back there?
Yes. These too hard to get.
an easier place.
Trying to figure out where that was. That was in the next frame - is the setting now, Dave?
We're doing on the SO 65, aren't we?
Yes, you're supposed to do another alignment - to 190, 30, 00.
I already did one to 190, 30, 00.
Oh, you did? Okay.
You did your align to 190? 30, 00?
You did it more than one REV ahead, huh?
Yes.
I'm sure he did.
he did.
Here, here's your
I was really looking forward to this. I thought you had a surprise.
Yes, I think I will. Hey, those were the - Corigodoes - Caragos shoals.
Oh, yes.
Hey, we could play interceptor with these Cepacols and vitamin pills. Cepacols could be the bombers and the vitamin pills, the fighters.
Want to try to see some cities at night here? We're going right over Perth...
Oh, really?
and right over Brisbane.
Oh, boy, coming up are a whole bunch of really nice islands in the South Pacific.
Where are we going?
Right up past New Caledonia and then the Loyalty Islands, the Fiji Islands, Western Samoa, Danger Island, right past Christmas Island - Boy, we got the whole batch of them.
Boy, we go right over Fiji.
When does it say to unstow, Jim?
I just the flight plan, Rusty. It says that after we terminate our SO 65 2-1/2 hours to unstow the spacecraft, and hour to eat, an hour to do chores, and then have our rest period.
Jim, you want these?
It took us 30 minutes to get ready for that burn yesterday?
Yes.
What time do we do SO 65? Is that the next thing we have?
Yes.
They want to take those off, even though the weather's broken.
190, 42 - 45 more.
Ready to unstow? I'll get them out.
Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon. I have one Hasselblad target of opportunity.
Go ahead, Houston. This is Apollo 9.
Roger. Your target will be Cape Blanc: oceanography, 191 plus 00 plus 33, five frames, 25-second interval, and it's north 5 degrees. Over.
Roger. The time is 191 00 30, Cape Blanc, oceanography, five frames, 25-second intervals, 5 degrees north.
Roger. And, Apollo 9, Houston. We've been noting that you've been averaging about 20 pounds of RCS per day, for the SO65 landmark and photos what have you. You still have about 70 pounds above the SCS, RCS redline, and what we're saying is that you can just about double your average usage and still be in good shape, if you want to do some particular tracking on something.
Okay. Very good. We've actually been throwing in a little particular tracking now and then too. I think the fuel usage that we've been having is probably all that we need. Thank you.
Oh, very well.
Apollo 9, Houston. We are coming up on Honeysuckle; S-band volume up in about 30 seconds.
Roger. Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston. About 45 seconds LOS. Redstone at 30.
All right.
Here's a little bag, Davey.
Do we have any 70-millimeter stuff to take yet?
Yes. Shots north of track.
Feeling any better?
Well, did you time yourself? Get all that way out?
Yes, I'm feeling - Boy, that's a lot better. Somewhere - in here, another 5 minutes
Dave, check that pyro there - It's
29:37, okay. Coming up across Baja California...
Apollo 9, Houston through Redstone. Standing by. A big long pass this time.
Okay. Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger.
Hey, Houston, what's the forecasted weather condition on the east coast?
Roger. Let me get you a good one for today there.
Okay. And in particular, I'm interested in whether we are going to get a good shot just north of Charleston there.
Roger.
9 Houston. From the indications we have down here, it's looking pretty good, and it ought to be open up that way.
Real great weather.
Roger.
Okay. Three pictures of clouds over Austin.
Apollo 9, Houston. I have a 16mm update.
Okay. Stand by one. I'll get ready to copy.
Roger. Standing by.
Okay, Houston. Go ahead and start.
Roger. Target will be Africa, Gulf of Guinea to Madagascar: 16mm, 75mm lens, six frames per second, CEX 368 film, start time 191 plus 03 plus 54, shoot south 30 degrees for 14 minutes.
Okay. Gulf of Guinea to Madagascar, 16mm, 70mm lens, six frames per second. CEX 368, 191:03:54, south 30 degrees for 14 minutes.
Roger. Next one, target will be Gulf Stream: same camera, same film, start at 192 plus 22 plus 00, shoot on track for 3 minutes.
Okay. Gulf Stream: 192 22 00 on track 3 minutes.
Okay. On one roll of that CEX 368 we'd like some interior photos. Use a spot meter at ASA 200, shutter speed 1/60. Use entire roll and mark the magazine for correct processing.
Houston, we don't have enough film to do that. We still have some interior film. We only have two full rolls of exterior, and we want to save one for reentry, so we only have one to play with and it looks like it will take it for the Gulf of Guinea and Africa and the Gulf Stream.
Oh, understand. I thought you had more than two.
No. There's two.
Okay. We're with you.
And, Apollo 9, I have some numbers where you can start looking for a fuel manifold pressure decay, to push the secondaries in your RCS.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. Alpha through Delta will be 48, 52, 44, and 48.
Okay. Understand, Houston. The onboard gage readout, is that correct?
That's affirmative. They'll be onboard gage readings - We'll update them as we go along here a little bit more, but that's where you can start looking for fuel manifold pressure decay to switch.
Okay. You want us to switch them 170?
Apollo 9, Houston. I missed your last comment; say it again.
Roger. You want us to go ahead and bring on the secondaries in 170 psi?
That's affirmative. 170 psi.
Okay.
9, Houston. With your earlier comment on fuel usage, we're predicting that you probably won't get to those crossover points today.
Okay. Understand. Probably won't reach them today, but we'll keep them in mind.
night pass.
Okay.
Yes, we're going across. Why don't you disable? We've already got it scheduled.
Yes. Step number 1 after the last pictures
Right.
There's the Crater, again.
Oh, really?
Yes, let me read it off - No, you can't see it out there, Dave. Get under me and look up there. No, under me - under me, look outside.
Oh, yes. Oh, that's really - real active, isn't it?
Yes.
It's still not time?
Apollo 9, Houston, about 1 minute LOS. Like to verify the attitude set switches in GDC.
I think the new ATTITUDE SET is in IMU.
Negative. The attitude set is at IMU.
and it goes to GDC. I knew there was a reason, for it...
Roger. Request GDC unless you have a real reason to put in IMU.
No. That's just where it ended up the last time I did a GDC set.
Roger.
I knew there was a reason!
Are they going to read something if you do it - leave it in GDC?
I don't know. When I ask them about that the other day, they said they were having trouble...
9, Houston. In preparation to firing up the S-band, like to do the LMP checklist, page 214, the first six steps of the TELECOMM system powerup.
Okay. Understand. The first six steps on 214 LMP checklist.
Roger.
You got her going? That's not bad!
No, it's not really.
Last night trying to vent the batteries down.
Yes, that doesn't look like
hazy up there?
That's the last roll of film.
I know.
reconfiguring.
What time do we have that high gain antenna thing?
232:08 or so.
Oh.
following steps.
It's a, Jimmy.
Yes.
Yes, we - we go out over and then back into.
14 minutes
Wool Oh, there are a lot of big clouds.
The water.
Another interesting thing, huh?
Oh, yes.
The either, you know it?
Lot's of water - pretty sight.
Sure we didn't want to point it out the other side?
No, right there in the middle.
No, right down the middle would probably be better.
pink, brown, blue - I've just seen a whole bunch of keen-looking clouds.
Keen-looking what?
Clouds.
Great.
Carry all the folks at home one apiece.
True.
Anything out there, but?
Yes.
Really?
Really a big
Oh, maybe they want the weather.
Got to go over that wild desert.
7 more minutes to go.
The clouds look like they're just 30 degrees south of track.
I'm never going to get this done over one station.
Repeat - repeat
Wonder if they know that?
part of Africa for 50 years.
I don't know - Stanley met Livingston.
Man, just think of all those lions and elephants and rhinoceri...
I don't see a one.
Sure is jungly down there, isn't it?
Boy, there's a - it really is jungly. Man, oh man!
We should be coming up over Lake Nyasa here sometime soon. A great big lake.
I don't really like
Lake Nyasa goes for miles.
Do you?
Yes, Lake Nyasa.
Whoo
There's some geology down there. I guess there's - just not ever been very many people in there, huh?
The ones that are in there don't come out.
The ones that go in don't come out?
You have about a minute more.
Supposed to go to Madagascar now, right?
Yes.
You better hurry up.
Sun's kind of peeping out down there, too.
Yes, it sure is. The shadows are really getting long. There's your update form. They block the view.
Is Madagascar in the view on the horizon?
I see the shoreline there on the horizon. Can you tell what time to turn it off?
50 something - 40 something.
the shadows.
Okay, Jimmy - you want to turn it off on time or let it go?
Madagascar.
Now is the time. 14 minutes should get it. I don't see Madagascar out either.
It's going to be too dark now anyway.
went out at the same time I started to hit it off.
These darn Cameroons - whabobbedo. What's under these clouds? Huh?
The weather - the weathermen will really think we're neat.
They will?
I hope.
Well.
I wonder if they want that thing on now to warm up.
Ron didn't really say when they wanted to do that.
I think we got 2 hours.
No. I don't know if they wanted to look at it or what. You know, beforehand, he said to do the first six steps in the checklist, but he didn't really say when.
Yes,
When do we turn it on? When do we do the steps?
193:08. In a couple of hours.
Why don't we turn it on about?
How come we're on secondary transponder?
Maybe it's because the primary didn't work very good. We've been for about 4 days.
Yes, I just never looked at the console. I just wanted to know when did we do it?
One day, I don't remember which one.
I am going to get me something to eat; I'm getting hungry.
I haven't even finished my breakfast yet.
Getting sleepy. So I have to have something to keep me awake.
The hours we keep are ridiculous.
191:25, P52 time
Hey, Jim.
Yes.
Through with the ORB rate?
Yes.
Okay, I'm going to VERB 46 in. Okay?
No, I clocked it
Here.
Huh?
I clocked it
Did you clock it the other way?
Yes,
Okay, I clocked it this way.
How did your ball work?
I think I'm going to go hunt one more time for my tape.
I think I can do that without disturbing aligner. (Singing) Boy, my old suit's really jammed over there now, isn't it? Goll!
It's definitely not in that pocket. It's not in that pocket. Let's see, it might be in this pocket:, an American flag, goofballs, some earplugs, another goofball, some lanyards, a neckband; and nothing else. Nothing at all.
In this pocket, we have - nothing - and in this pocket, we have - nothing. I have a sneaky feeling my tape is either in orbit by itself or it went by-by with the LM.
Maybe you and put it in it.
Yes, I may very well have.
in the suit.
No, I don't think so. I think, Jim, I would've put it in that pocket, Jim, and...
You mean hidden in here...
Yes, but most of the things that have hidden themselves have magicly unhidden themselves. Doesn't say it isn't.
Oh, well, another meal without music!
your platform.
Oh, oh!
What's today? What's today? Do you know?
Tuesday.
It is Tuesday?
Tuesday.
Nice day, isn't it?
Let's see. We launched on the third. It's the 12th, isn't it?
I'd say you're right.
I think that's right.
I think that's right; somebody told me we come back on Thursday.
Well, the only other place it could be is in the L-shaped bag, I don't have the courage to challenge that. Hey, look what I found, a whole bunch of stop-trots. You want some stop-trots?
Just what we need. Well, let's see what we're doing.
What were you after?
Ob, I was trying to find - Saturn.
Did you find it?
No, it's not in the field of view.
The rings are almost edge on, man. I don't think it's going to be very spectacular.
Oh, are they really?
Yes. I think it takes another 6, 7, or 8 years before they get to the point where they come up with a good angle again.
09.
Okay. Understand Hawaii LOS at 45:07, instead of 09.
Hey, that's great. I was hoping you'd get a chance to try that.
Oh, good.
Well, good.
Apollo 9. Houston through Carnarvon. I have an S065 update.
Okay, Houston. Stand by one.
9, Houston. While you are digging things out you might dig out your procedures book, and I can update your high-gain antenna test.
Okay. Why don't you give us the S065 first?
Roger. You ready?
Roger. Go.
18000 28990, yaw is all zips 192 09 30 192 00 00, ORB RATE. First sight Colorado River: 192 14 33 10 08. Second sight, Snyder, Texas: 192 18 02 08 03. Third sight, Cumberland Plateau: 192 21 11 08 and 03. Over.
Roger. 180 00 289 90 all zips 192 09 30 192 00 00. Orbit rate, Colorado River: 192 14 33 10 08. And someplace in Texas: 192 18 09 08 03. Cumberland Plateau: 192 21 11 08 03.
Roger. Readback correct. That's Snyder, Texas. And your Victor through Zulu numbers will be the same as before.
Okay...
Okay. What do you have on the high gain S-band antenna?
Okay. Why don't we just copy these things down, if you have got a pad there to copy; and then I'll go into the procedures and change the procedure itself.
Okay. Stand by. Let me just get a pad.
And while you are doing that, we are going to be kind of close there between the end of the SO65 and the first Carnarvon pass. And, also, you have got a P52 realignment in there; so if we miss that Carnarvon pass, we'll catch it over Hawaii.
Yes. We can get that. No problem.
Okay. Good.
Okay. Go ahead with the PAD. Ron.
Okay. The platform is aligned out of plane to the north; voice COMM will be VHF. Okay. Change high-gain antenna test procedures as follows:...
Non, will you give me the PAD first, or notes, Ron.
I'll give you notes first.
Okay. Stand by. I got the PAD first. Hold on.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Okay. I've got the procedures book here, now, with our procedure in it. Will your notes follow the procedures so I can mark directly on it?
Okay. Let's go into that part first, and then I'll give you some additional notes.
Okay.
Okay. In the procedures book, you go on down to step 7, and your antenna angles are pitch, minus 45 degrees; yaw is plus 90 degrees.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay? Delete step 8, perform step 9 at 193 plus 06 plus 05, and add high-gain antenna track to reacquire.
As part of step 9, Ron?
Affirmative. At. the end of step 9 there.
Do step 10 at acquisition which will be at 08 plus 05. Delete step 12.
Any more than that, Ron?
Affirmative. While I think about it S-band volume up at 42 for Honeysuckle.
Okay. On step 13. We'll do that three times. The first one at Carnarvon LOS, that'll be at 19 plus 40; at Hawaii AOS, be 35 plus 22; and Hawaii LOS at 44 plus 09. And scratch step 15 on.
Okay. Is that everything on the procedures then?
Okay. That's all of the procedures. I'd like to get you set up in a passive thermal control. And I can give you some numbers for that so that we can be in PTC as we are going through this test.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. We're back with you now. Go ahead with the PTC.
Okay. Establish ORB RATE by using PTC CMP checklist page 3 - 17. Okay. Step 2: at 193 plus 06, pitch 352.00 - rather roll is 352.0 - Pitch and yaw are all zeros.
Okay. Do you have any more, or do you want me to read all that back to you?
Negative. I have some more. New step 6 and step 7 of that CMP checklist as follows: VERB 24 NOUN 01 ENTER, 3125 ENTER, 4 zips 2 ENTER, 14713 ENTER. Step 7: VERB 21 ENTER, 3176 ENTER, 23163 ENTER. And that should be it.
Okay, Ron. 1 got that. For step 6 is only change is 00002 and 14713, and the number on step 7 is 23163.
That's right.
Okay. On that, I got - just a minute. Ron, I've got one more question. On the time you gave us there, shouldn't that time be for step 7?
That's affirmative. Should be on step 7, that time there, 193 plus 06.
Okay. Thank you.
Glad you're checking us.
Okay. On the procedures, on step 7 you've got the pitch of minus 45 and yaw of plus 90; delete step 8; perform step 9 at 193 06 05; and add after the existing step 9, high gain antenna track to REACQ: on step 10 should be done at acquisition which should be at 08 05; delete step 12; step 13 we're going to do three time; Carnarvon LOS at 119 40; Hawaii AOS at 235 22; and Hawaii LOS at 44 09. Delete everything beyond step 15 - delete step 15 and beyond. Excuse me.
Affirmative. Delete step 15 and beyond. The AOS and LOS times I gave you were 193 in minutes.
Right. Okay. Understand the platform is going to be out-of-plane to the north, and we're going to use VHF voice for radio.
Roger. I'll give you Carnarvon LOS, time is 193 19 40. Hawaii AOS is 193 35 22, LOS is 193 44 07.
Okay. Understand the Hawaii LOS is at 44 07 instead of 09.
Affirmative.
Okay. We'll look these over, and if we have any questions I'll give you a buzz later.
Okay. Just also note that on step 13 there, where we take those three times, copy them down after the antenna stops slewing.
Man, am I sleepy!
Understand. Copy down after the antenna stops slewing.
Roger.
Why don't you drive the boat and let me take a little nap?
Okay.
I think, Dave, we're going to do just about everything we had - that we brought up here with us.
didn't even know you had with you.
Well, I didn't think we'd be able to get this thing in here in time. We - we wrote it up, but I didn't think we'd get it in here.
What time is it?
192:48
We're at 191:48 now, Jim.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, let me see.
Let's see. We're supposed to do...
An SO 65 we've got to do.
Gosh, we've only got a few minutes to get to bed, Jim.
Hand me that thing again, Rusty.
The SO 65 pad here?
Yes. SO 65.
I can't find the damn thing; oh, here it is. Oh, wait a minute. The data is not here, is it?
I put it right after that.
Oh, yes, in the gimbal angle; okay.
frames in 8 seconds - Whooee!...
8-second intervals.
Ohh!
Damn, damn, that's a
catch up
When we catch up, we're safe.
What do we have to do tomorrow?
Get ready for that 350-pound cake. Oh boy, oh boy. I hope they have some ice cream with that.
Have a 340-pound ice cream sandwich!
Yes, yes! Okay, 10 frames at 8 seconds starting at 32. 21, 49, 57 - Yes, alright. DSKY 21, 49
Your time is 190:09 - 192:00:00. Key align.
Oh, key align, I already did that. It's lunch time, now, isn't it?
Yes, from the time we got up, it is.
Almost bedtime for McDivitt.
I'm really sleepy.
Okay, about the time we get sleepy, he'll wake up again and go charging off on some campaign.
Naturally.
Look out.
That's right (laughter). I know it.
Oh, oh, you - Where's your bag full of - Oh, here it is. Hard food. the light
Those are peaches in there.
Peaches? I just remembered
Fuel cell 2 seems to have cured itself completely.
Yes, it looks pretty good, doesn't it?
Went charging along all night, huh?
Hey, Dave, you know what did it...
No...
the hydrogen purging...
(Laughter)
no.
Sure it did...
With all that contamination?
until it finally blew it out.
It was close to the redline.
does that.
No kidding.
A red - orange and blue sunrise.
get a 120 something times
We've had a couple, haven't we?
I was talking to my right before launch, and going over the flight plan, and he said, "You're going to start coming down on the hundred and whatever it was revolution." And I thought, "Oh God! Don't say it that way.
(Laughter)
It really sounded like an awfully long time when he said it in revolutions.
Ho hum, I could just about take a 10-minute nap here, if Dave got us to the right spot at the right time.
We're almost there, aren't we? Yes, we're there.
Oh, they got 10 more degrees.
Okay, Let me get my nap.
I'll get us there. I'll do my fair share.
Better look out.
Wait until we get the S-band test. There's nothing I have to do there, I don't believe, besides turn the S-band off to nap.
Listen, we'll let you nap, if you'll promise not to get on a campaign tonight when it's bed - time for bed.
Okay, I promise. Tomorrow, look out; today, you're safe.
Tomorrow, I wish you'd do a lot of campaigning.
(Laughter) They had a little trouble If we -
Drop in on them.
land on the carrier tonight it will really surprise everybody, because we're not going home until Wouldn't that be something - See that spot - and all of a sudden you see it go - (Laughter)
Whee! Klonk!
No, if we could do a 98-degree left-hand turn and fly about 4000 miles north and land.
Seems like it's getting stuffy in here!
I was noticing that, too, I'm wondering if -
Yes, why don't you take? It's all here; I got it.
Where did you have it?
Hey, guess we ought to do away with the cam - -
Now we'll get to see how good a COAS calibration is after 5 days.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go, Houston.
Why don't we get the coordinates of the carrier and surprise them and land tonight?
Roger. If you haven't guessed it yet, I guess you can see the purpose of this S-band antenna test is - We're testing the automatic REACQ mode of this high gain antenna during PTC when the crew may be asleep on the way to the Moon. So you can use VERB 64 to monitor, but we don't want you to do any manual slewing to help the reacquisition between Carnarvon and Hawaii.
Okay. Understand. No manual operation. Shall we make it authentic by sleeping, too?
Well, no. You've got enough sleep. You can just observe.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston, go.
Okay. Houston, he'll make it authentic, I guarantee you!
Okay.
Want our last gyro torqueing angles?
Roger. Ready to copy.
191 - Stand by. We are getting ready to start this maneuver; I'll give them to you in a minute.
Okay.
Ron, while we are waiting here: be advised I have looked through the flight plan, and I think if we go through tomorrow just as it is scheduled in the flight plan, we will be all right.
Very well. Sounds good, then.
If we knock off at the time that we are supposed to knock off, we will have plenty of time to stow the spacecraft.
Okay, understand.
Okay, here are your gyro torqueing angles, if you are ready.
Ready to copy.
191 26 00, minus 00232, plus 00509, minus 00010.
Roger. We copy that.
Okay.
Houston, this is Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
Well, I think this is a fairly successful SO65 pass. We had some real nice weather over the clouded areas. And Snyder, Texas, had a deck of clouds that looked like it came right up next to it, and I think that both the geologist and the weatherman will really appreciate these because it shows a solid deck of clouds and a really sharp break, and then the land sticks out from underneath it. So they ought to both get a good - A pretty good piece of it.
Very, very good. By golly.
And, Houston, you got an uplink for us?
Affirmative. Request for an ACCEPT and we have the REFSMMAT standing by to send to you.
Okay. You've got P00 in ACCEPT.
Apollo 9, Houston. We'd like you to verify your SPS heater and gaging MAIN A and MAIN B circuit breakers are open.
Negative. SPS system heaters and gaging MAIN A and MAIN B circuit breakers are closed.
Roger. We'd like to open them. We are not going to use PUGS for the deorbit burn.
Alrighty. We'll open them up for you right now.
Roger.
Apollo 9, the computer is yours.
All right. Go back to the BLOCK.
Roger.
That was pretty snappy.
They are still smiling.
How are all you guys down there in that MOCR holding up? We giving you fatigue yet?
Oh no. We're still in good shape.
Good. I want those recovery guys to find a nice soft piece of water with no wind and no waves tomorrow and lots of sunshine.
We're working on it real good.
Oh yes. I forgot one thing, a couple of helicopters, too.
Okay.
I want you to tell those guys on the Guadalcanal we're looking forward to seeing them.
Okay. You're still thinking about the cake.
Well, that and a few other things.
And that, too.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. I've got some pointing data for you, if you want to take a look at Pegasus.
Houston, 9.
Roger. You there now?
Yes.
Okay. At 192 plus 43 plus 09 with a roll 357.8, pitch 179.9, yaw 326.4, you should see Pegasus passing through your COAS, and it'll take about 45 seconds. It'll be passing from right to left. You will be trailing it by about 920 miles, and will be 77 miles below it.
Okay. What was the roll?
Roll is 357.8.
Okay. At 192 43 09 - was that?
Affirmative.
Okay. The angles 357.8, 179.9, 326.4. Pegasus is passing right to left 920 trailing at 77 below.
Roger.
9, Houston. You've got about 150 square feet of area on Pegasus, so you might be able to get a pretty good look at it.
Roger. Where those inertial angles or local vertical?
Roger. Those are inertial angles assuming you haven't torqued the platform on around to the new REFSMMAT we gave you.
That's a good assumption at this point. And be advised we have taken - We've taken 105 frames of the SO65 now.
Roger. 105 frames.
Apollo 9, Houston through Ascension. Standing by.
Roger, Houston,
Apollo 9, Houston. I can't read you. You're in a keyhole right now.
Apollo 9, Houston. We might be able to read you now.
Say again. Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger. I missed everything you said there, Jim, we're in a keyhole on the S-band.
Okay. I said we are going to try to see if we can't see Pegasus, and I was wondering how long we could expect to see it in view, how many minutes?
Would you believe 44 seconds to the - just to the COAS part of it at that attitude, so you can see it a little bit longer than that going through the window.
Okay.
9, Houston. We've been looking for some other things with a little more of a trailing angle. Seems like everything we've come across so far is about a 90-degree crossing.
Oh great. We're always out of phase.
Yes.
I'm not sure that you would either.
Gee, that must be a satellite! Whew! Whew!
Apollo 9, Houston. About 30 seconds LOS. Tananarive at 53.
Roger. Houston. We saw Pegasus going by. We were admiring the diastimeters, and wishing the spacecraft were in the proper attitude. At the moment we went through
and right at the moment that you said it'd be there, why, she went through. It appeared as two bright, white spots, separated by about...
No, wait; that's the diastimeter split, Jim.
Oh. Okay. We saw her go through as a bright spot. He was going very fast; probably took him about 20 seconds or so to get across the field of view of the diastimeter from right to left. Yes. That's right, I forgot about that.
Roger.
You can't focus on it at infinity...
Yes.
stopped at 4 miles. Well! That was exciting.
Yes, it was. Sort of broke up the day, didn't it? (Laughter)
Sure did.
Okay. Let's see - We're not doing anything else
dump urine, that's all
(Laughter) You never found - Well, let's see, if you had the COAS pointed in the wrong direction, you never would see it, would you?
No, I finally saw it, Jim.
Did you? Oh, good.
But I wasn't sure what it was, at all. But when you yawed back over you got him just about on the axis at one point there.
Yes, I came back over and...
Yes.
and then he came right back in, and then he drifted out to the top.
He was really moving!
Yes, wasn't he, though? (Laughter)
Whoo! Did you, Dave?
Yes. It took me a minute to find out - what - what sort of my eyes in.
Yes. Okay.
Yes.
I want to look at the ground
I was looking at the ground as he came across and I think it - plus, maybe you're pointing straight down here, and it just doesn't hack it. Here. I'll get it.
No, it's...
Yes, I know how - I know how it has to go in.
I've got a half of an orange.
You what?
Did anybody lose half of an orange?
Yes. It's probably mine. Yes.
Jim, I'm going to do an alignment, again...
Yes, you've got to do an alignment, and ye have to do an S-band antenna thing.
Yes, that'll be day.
Yes, what's the - past the control plane here; we're supposed to point out - to point out of plane which way?
North. You've got the - you've got the angles - you should have angles. Rusty wrote them down in that - in the...
Okay, you got to do the platform alignment first; that's the main thing. Matter of fact, if we have to point out of plane north - Well, we're already doing that...
Why don't you do it right there?
Yes; I was going to say we're already doing that, so we should be able to get by here without getting into timbal lock.
You know, I was really hoping they'd try a P32...
Yes.
because with that much rate stuff, boy, I'd we don't go to sleep.
Yes.
we just let her roll.
I think they are going to have to do that - I frankly can't see how you're going to go to the Moon, unless you sleep on the way.
Boy, I don't either.
If they can't expect us to be able to do anything when we get there.
You could spend q day learning how to housekeep and 2 days resting.
Man, I've got to get that down there. Ohh! The garbage hag is really loading up. Umph!
Okay, P52 preferred. Oh, ho.
It doesn't come up with a 2, does it?
You're supposed to come up with a 1 in it if they load it preferred; and desired REFSMMAT, you supposed to set the flag.
It is, huh?
I thought you did away with the flag.
Well, the flag's still there but it's really - really - There's no constraint on the flag. But they used to set it when they uplinked the desired REFSMMAT, so you'd get the one here that says them the are loaded. But that's the last thing they sent up on the uplink, so it's got to be there. If it's not there, we get a garbage alignment.
Great!
How's that look, Jim?
That looks - that doesn't look like it's going to get us out of plane, Dave. That's only going to yaw us over about 20 degrees.
Yes, but you're already yawed over here already.
Yes, but that would yaw us back toward the middle wouldn't it?
Well, I don't - They didn't necessarily say - they said it's aligned out of plane to the north they didn't really say it's like...
Okay. Alright. Try it.
this doesn't get her out of plane.
Yes. Yes, but not that much, usually.
Well, we can talk to them over Carnarvon, and if that's wrong, they'll - We can do it some other time.
You're not going to try in daytime, I hope.
No.
We're getting on towards dark here; I'll wait.
We'll wait until Rusty gets through obliterating the sky.
(Laughter)
Who has the...
Go ahead and try it. See what happens.
Who has the tourniquet tied around my right leg?
I guess that's me. My hose. Try it, Dave; see what happens.
No, I'll wait. I don't want to press my luck.
You know, as a matter of fact, the way my COMM cable is routed now, I'm a little more mobile than I usually am. Goes around the bottom and comes back in.
Well, let's see. There's got to be a tissue dispenser or either around somewhere.
Okay, the tissue dispenser...
There's one on top of my head. Here's one.
Okay. Thank you, David.
You'd think that, with as many of these as we have, you wouldn't have any trouble finding one.
We need to keep one permanently stowed in the bathroom down here.
Well, I try to keep one over on this side, because this is where I go to the can, but I - I'm never over there.
That's the trouble; we've got three different bathrooms.
(Laughter)
I go on my side; David goes in the middle; and you go on your side.
MASTER ALARM? My caution and warning light lit up. Oh, my goodness, there's only one CRYO PRESS, right?
That P CO2 runs about 1.9, no matter what. I think the gage is stuck.
No, it goes down to 1.5 after changing and 1.8 to 2.
Yes.
It always goes back down to...
Did it go down a little bit?
I think it...
Yes.
Every time I look at it, it looks like it's always about in the same spot.
How's fuel cell 2, today?
Great. Behaving like a normal fuel cell.
Are these the?
dirty. Ugh! pretty grubby, although actually it's not as grubby as if we were in the woods somewhere.
Say, it's not as grubby as I thought it was going to be.
Up here, you can't dig yourself a slit trench. clean myself clean.
(Laughter)
It's all done, if you want to check it. I thought we were almost through the darkness when we were looking at that...
You're right, Dave.
Pegasus thing.
We were almost through the darkness.
How come we're not in the darkness?
I don't know. I don't have the slightest. I don't have the flight plan.
You don't figure our orbits have speeded up a little, do you?
(Laughter) You don't know how to clean windows. You're going to do it the rest of the flight.
star check.
Okay.
It might not be a bad idea.
Yes.
and-check the field of view, due to There's - there's quite a few - If you get the navigation star - there's two or three more in there.
Stop that.
(Singing) Here, you want to put these back, Dave?
No, those aren't mine; I don't know where they came from.
Oh. Well - they're Dave's to Jim.
Oh. Hey, before you start, let me throw a piece of trash over in the - in the locker.
Oop. I caught something - was getting out there.
Mmm
Alright.
What's that you been using up?
What's the station before we go?
as well.
If it does, I hope we don't get a (Laughter)
It doesn't - You won't even notice the table of food.
Huh?
By the time it touched the, it will probably the entire - the whole
He's got all those pieces.
Ooh. Throw it out.

The SPS chamber pressure.
Oh, really?
Yes.

Pineapple, fruitcake. You guys like the fruitcake?
I just had some
There is enough fruitcake for you to have one a meal for the rest of the flight and have plenty left over it. Right, Dave?
I used to like all that stuff.
See. See. But I still say that deadband.
I wasn't going to say a word. I was just going to see if you hollered about that.
I still say that
You haven't had a slice one,, Dave.
I had another one today. Earlier today, I had one. Where'd the flight plan go? Anybody got the flight plan? Rusty, you got the flight plan?
Not me.
No, not me. It's on the end of the
Oh, here it is, right here.
That's where I put it, so we wouldn't lose it.
Won't work that way.
Okay, I'll get it.
I think we you (laughter).
Felt like you
Didn't hurt.
How do you say the didn't hurt?
Makes you feel like you don't.
exact principle.
Hey, Dave, hurry up and do that, because we've got to get pver to the while we're still in the dark.
I'm almost through, I'm just getting the third star check here. Okay.
I thought you were going to do stars
No, no, no, no. I'm Just getting the third star check.
Okay. Rusty, where do we have to go?
Yes, up we go.
35200.
35200. Right?
I'm going to turn on the power on the S-band. There you are. You going to move that hose, Jim?
No. that
No, it's not, Dave. Let me just - I'll be right back.
What time do we have to be there, Rusty?
We're pretty - Whoo! 193:06, we got to start the maneuver, which is right now.
193:06:05...
Maneuver right there, right now.
Let's get on with this.
Man, I didn't realize we were that late. Maneuver's got to be good.
6 minus 35 - in yaw. S-band is
There's to - set the wide deadband.
Okay.

Roger. This is Apollo 9.
Roger.
One minute to LOS and when you come up to Hawaii there, I'll give you the numbers to disable that 121 alarm for the landmark tracking thing.
Very good. I'm ready.
Alright.
Think I'll lay this way for a while. Call me if anything happens, huh? I'm trying to sleep with my foot -
Gee. We're never going to get this camera
Doesn't look like it, does it? Yes, we're starting

But we started to turn little late. Okay, now, there it goes.
Would you "believe "No"? I've got; Rusty.
I know.
It's just sitting there.
Okay, so now I'm supposed to say, "Log the time and the angles after it stopped slewing." So it stopped slewing...
Yes, it sure did.
around. LOS.
Yes, it sure did.
Well, alright.
1, 2, 3. Okay, let's see.
Time was 9 193:20
And the pitch is plus 45 and yaw is 265.
Oh, you're kidding.
Well, I don't - I don't see wearing those things for a whole trip - if it didn't bother you. some kind of gloves.
Here it is! Yes, that's what I thought.
Did it come hack?
When you break lock, it ought to go right back to where you set it originally.
Obviously it's working, as far as transmitting and receiving, because you talked
No, we're talking on VHF.
Oh, I thought you were talking on the
Walt a minute. That's not P70 - Shoot! P40 - P35.
See if you can slew the antenna. It's a long way to P40.
I guess I ought to these things.
Yes, talk about a rat's nest!
This is.
Hey, Dave.
What?
Okay, drive it, that's what it's for to drive while you rest.
You're in charge of driving.
Okay, very good.
give you a rough time...
Hey, are we in - We're in PTC and it's nighttime. Let's turn out the lights and see how many times it flashes.
Hey, let me get my Hawaii acquisition time - 35:2 okay.
How about giving Jim? Watch the jets fire. It's in wide deadband, isn't it?
Yes.
Apollo 9, Houston through Huntsville.
Houston, say again.
Roger, I have one target for passing across the States.
Say again that last, Ron.
9, Houston. I have one Hasselblad target.
Okay, stand by.
Where in hell's the update book?
Okay, go ahead.
Roger, Dallas/Fort Worth; geography, 193 plus 53 plus 11, 15 frames, 6-second intervals. That'll be north 20 degrees. Over.
Okay, understand Dallas/Fort Worth, geography, 193:53:11, 15 frames, 6-second Delta-T, north 20 degrees.
Did we ever find the map?
Yes.
Okay, what's my time? 35:22.
Go ahead, Houston; Apollo 9.
Houston, 9.
Gees, the angles they gave me were pretty good.
to start with?
Minus 45 and plus - You mean these angles or those angles?
Those - Your angles. How do we do from here?
You just track very smoothly up there.
Up there?
Yes. computer thing
For what now?
That's where it ought to be pointing right now - If you want to point it - I'm not sure how that thing is - if you want to point it, you'd -
To where?
The station.
The center of the Earth?
Yes.
Well, that doesn't help any. If we go around the Earth - Keep the angles the angles point to the center.
That's right. Anytime you go over...
If you go right over the station.
Yes, as you ro - as you roll, it would be an attitude change, but it's now going to help you around the Earth.
Even if it - even if you did roll - just as well be the center of the Earth, shouldn't you?
Yes, but it doesn't help you on any once you're going away from the Earth.
What's your AOS?
35 - 2.
There It goes. Bang! The first single
Goes right to where you set it.
Right to where I set it. No, it's not These dials are supposed to follow the actual position of the antenna. They almost look like they - 35, 16 Think that went to 90 and minus 70.
Okay, landmark pad: ID 006 195:22:1500, NA on the FDAI and the shaft and trunnion. Your time of closest approach, 195:25:5300, and you'll be at - the target is 78 miles north.
Roger, understand. ID 006 is 195:22:1500, closest approach 195:25:5300, target is 78 miles north.
Roger, the next one.
Go ahead.
Landmark 130; 195:35:3100, TCA time, 195:39:0400; and it's 27 miles north.
Roger, understand. 130, 195:35:3100; closest approach 195:39:0400, 27 miles north.
Okay, and I've got some more pointing data now for a little better pass on the Pegasus.
Say again the last. You were broken.
9, Houston. Delay that; I want to recheck the times on it.
Houston. 9. I'm sorry, but there's a lot of static. Can you say again, please?
Roger. We'll get your pointing data over Antigua, probably. We're not quite sure of the times yet.
Okay, fine, thank you.
CAPCOM, FAO reminds me not to disable the 121 alarm until after they're through with their P52.
Roger; do not disable until after completing P52. Understand.
I'm waiting for it to lock back on again.
Oh.
for it to warm up. Hit it early though.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Houston 9. Go.
Roger, for Redstone, be sure S-BAND ANTENNA to OMNI and HIGH GAIN ANTENNA track switch to MANUAL.
Roger; S-BAND to OMNI and HIGH GAIN track to MANUAL for Redstone.
Okay, and you want us to do that now, Houston?
Affirmative, now.
Roger, we're there.
Roger. We are getting movies of it right now.
Okay. Good deal. You're ahead of us. And the other ones clouded in, we found out, so that's it.
Okay, fine.
Hey, Ron, are we just going over the recovery sites?
Say again. I missed it.
Did we just go over the recovery sites?
Stand by one; just a second.
Where's the Guadalcanal? I was just looking down, and I saw a great big ship down there. I just wondered if we happened to pass it.
I think you are way south of it.
We're way south of it?
Affirmative.
Okay.
ARIA 5, Houston CAP COMM. Go remote.
Tell you what we ought to do; we ought to finish up that other little bitty roll of movie film. Then pick up the rest of the indoors today and we'll just have - won't take any movies tomorrow.
Going remote.
I think it's a good idea.
ARIA 5 remote.
Apollo 9, Houston through ARIA for voice checks.
Just a little broken, but readable. How us?
Roger. I think you are a little less than readable.
Try again.
All right. Another one, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, Apollo 9 out.
Roger. It was much better that time, Jim.
Okay. And you are coming through pretty good now, too.
All you got to do is switch VHF antenna.
You know, it looks like we're going to luck out on this part of it.
why don't you check to see if we got the tight deadband, Davey?
Alright.
We're going to be 700 miles behind him this time; we're catching up. You hear what they want to do?
Yes.
I wonder whose state vector they're going to update.
I don't know, but that sounds like a great idea.
Yes, but I - They must - they must be going to update his state vector. You know, by having another sextant and putting in a state vector they think he has and knowing our state vector and update his state vector.
Yes, great, great idea.
Yes. I wonder what they are going to pump you for a W-matrix?
One.
I don't know, but I bet the MIT cats are really ginning (laughter)
I bet they are. Say, how come you got a red beard?
Do I really? My be red, but...
not much redder than now, does it?
No, it's mostly gray. Old, gray man.
Whoo! in a big hurry.
Yes.
Better to go home with all day early than to go home with them all empty.
right date. We go home with them all empty on the right day.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. Another voice check, S-band.
I'm not thinking too well today. Back to bed.
Say again, Houston.
Roger. I just wanted to - ARIA is sending S-band back to us now for voice checks.
Okay.
Loud and clear.
Roger. We're reading you pretty well, too.
Are they still uplinking on VHF?
Yes. I think they are working a little better nowadays than they used to be.
Hey. I think they come in very handy.
Hey, Jim, you going...
Concur wholeheartedly.
Say again.
He's going to be in field of view for 30 seconds.
Great.
make a big thing Now for a little lunch.
Jim, you got any There's a great big hunk of hot chocolate down there. Wonder who put that there?
Probably me.
The hot chocolate kid.
Gee, your face really looks a lot better, Dave.
It really does? You mean maybe won't throw me off the ship for scurvy.
Okay, the time is 14:10; we've got 2 minutes to go.
Yes, this is one of the busiest days we've had.
Yes, I'd like to get really dark adapted to something before I - Oh, hell, what have we got going out there? That must be the thruster stuff.
Gee, we never got a picture of the thruster firing.
I tell you, I think that is a waste of film.
Really? It takes all kinds to make horse races. It's pretty.
I don't think, if you took it, Dave.
Huh?
I say, I think the point is, I don't think you're going to see it.
With a movie camera you will.
Maybe you would with C-IN.
Yes.
Wide open.
You could see it just as well as a
Yes. Which is also a waste of film.
Yes, that was. It didn't turn out at all. ground to those islands.
What's the time, Dave?
clock.
Oh, that doesn't help me any.
Well, if you can look at it; I can't see it
You have 57 seconds.
Okay. I'm trying not to look out; I'm trying to get dark adapted, I don't want to look -
Are we at the attitude?
Yes.
How much time now, Jim?
We should be there.
I see it; I see it. Okay. It's coming through just below the X-axis.
I see it, too.
You see it, too? And it's going to go right through the damned X-axis - No, it's just a little below it.
Okay, Houston; we've got it. It's going out the left corner there.
Yes, he's going to be going out the left side.
Is it? Sure is. Okay.
Yes. You got to go left. You can still see him, Jim?
What?
Jim, do you still see him?
No.
Okay, he's way out to the left.
Yes.
You're going to get in gimbal lock, Dave. There he is again.
Yes, he's quite a ways out. He's dumping a lot of stuff out of his thrusters, too.
Gee, he's just standing there doing that.
Huh?
He came back in and...
Apollo 9, Houston. Any joy?
Roger, Houston. We got it. He went through the - He went to the diastimeter about a degree and a half low...
And the same on the COAS. But on the COAS, he was only about a half of a degree low.
Okay. Half degree low on the COAS.
Right. But now it is in the right window, and it's probably not calibrated very well.
He was a degree and a half in the left window, which should be calibrated pretty good.
Okay. We're a little curious on the times. How did the times work out there?
Looks like he was like - about 10 seconds late.
Okay.
Boy, he's really moving.
Yes. That's just about a 90 degree crossing there.
Apollo 9, Houston. One minute LOS. Tananarive at 30, and Carnarvon 44.
Roger.
Yes, old fuel cell 2 is hanging in there like it - like it was always doing nice.
(Laughter)
It isn't even a fifth different from the other two today.
How does that look on your ball, Jim?
Great.
Okay, here we go.
What did you look for, when - when you're making that judgment?
Just see if it's going to go into gimbal lock By doing one after another, you...
If it coarse aligns ~ it - it can coarse align in gimbal lock without hurting anything.
Yes, but it just can't coarse align into gimbal lock.
So you can tell that by looking at what's on here?
Yes.
Yes.
Is that all you look at or do you...
Well, just look at that and see about where it's going; make sure it goes over in that general direction.
The primary thing is to gimbal angle.
Yes.
Find gimbal angle.
Yes, but - yes, but Dave could judge that to see if it's in gimbal lock; that's why I'm wondering - that's why I wondered. I never paid attention to what you were doing there, just always hear you.
Give the leader a chance to say something.
Yes.
Well, (yawn)...
You want your COAS back?
No.
You ought to know that the ball doesn't go around, when going around there, too. Yes, you don't go through thruster malfunction.
Laying on your stomach sleeping.
Yes.
Hey, we've something, Jim. We can stop.
Okay. There we are, stop.
Let me look at our next REV here and see where we're going. Hmm, that time we came down over the -
Boy, we're really getting to the South American passes early today.
Yes.
It's going to be light down there.
Yes, every day the terminator moves farther south.
Farther where?
To the south.
Oh.
south. It's really not the terminator; it's
Well, it's got to move farther south on one side and farther north on the other side, huh? Or something like that?
When you start out - you start out with the daylight eventually you'd have all this in darkness
It doesn't go straight across the map, does it? I mean - I mean does the curve - It's got to go like that?
Yes.
But we've seen this in daylight, all time.
I don't think we have.
Sure, early this morning - this was all in daylight. Well, alright, now let me - let me see. Okay, you may be right. We...
Yes.
That's right in Australia...
Well, we saw this in daylight today or - No, we just missed it, didn't we?
we saw
Saw this in daylight?
I think our problem in Australia
(Coughing)
Hey, that's ridiculous. What did we say on that Barbados?
Said north of track, didn't we?
I think I put it on the top of the next page.
Yes.
North. 30. Look at this. And, that's the way we were looking.
That's the way we were trying, too.
Yes, we could have been taking the right one. Aah!
We took the wrong one?
Yes, I should have looked at the map, but I didn't have time.
We took those lovely pictures of nothing, just like you said.
Luckily, it was only three.
Were there some clouds out there? Dave,...
Yes, there were some clouds.
Okay, weather change photography.
Oh, that's a dirty shame.
It always pays to check that map.
Whooee! Pretty dim. Whooee!
Too light in here?
No, I've got Dnoces, and it's right on the edge of the field of view and I - It's just too dim.
Probably in the other optics...
Yes, and it's - it's so dim; I can't really be sure. I'm going to try it once, and if it's, I'll go get another one.
Hey, Jim, the two Magellanic Clouds are right out the front window.
Good.
A little high. Let me turn down my - ye old COAS.
See them? They are up pretty high and a little to the right. Oh, ho ho! I guessed it; I guessed it; I guessed It. I passed my star test today. Golly!
Okay, let's see
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Did you really see them?
I've never seen them, except at the planetarium.
Yes. Here, look in this one.
Holy
Yes.
Sure is pretty. They form a triangle.
(Laughter)
They cute? They could form a triangle with anything.
Achenar is the one to
I never used those as gouges, because they are never really...
Man, that's weird; the Moon just came up through the airglow.
Really a weird shape when it came through.
Yes.
The larger and smaller Magellanic Clouds -
(Coughing) Excuse me.
By George, there's
If you can barely recognize Regor, you can always find
they're really very significant and easy-to find stars.
What's significant about them?
They're easy to find; that's what's significant.
That's right.
I can find Regor...
Which one's that - The one with the cross?
No, the one from Leo.
Oh, hold it; wait a minute.
Okay, we got a good platform Look out this window, it's better than telescope.
What are we going to do with that stuff?
Do a landing mark.
Kind of looks like a...
ready yet?
Yes.
Which way is the landmark?
North.
Oh, my god! Stars!
How about that?
How about that?
I'm going to have to do a little thrusting, here.
such a big deal with you, I get lost.
(Laughter)
Let's see. Let's look and see what kind of move we're going to do.
Hey, go to MAMUAL and slew your optics, Mr. Scott
Yes.
That doesn't bother it where we are, huh?
First, let's turn the CMC, Off.
Yes, to MANUAL, right?
Yes, and I'll put - out of zero.
First or second?
First one. It's easier if you turn the CMC, Off, and then you won't get a drive until the last stored value. Then turn zero off.
Okay.
What are you reading?
195 - 2 - there's your closest approach. 78 north and then I'm going to take out that - alarm. The alarm, the 121 alarm?
We passed that up. Oh, I see what's happening. Oh, that's what it looks like when you give a...
Yes.
the thingamajig. Oh, I see now.
It really wipes you out, doesn't it?
Yes. Yes, I never appreciated it before.
That's where I had Dnoces, right on the edge. If you could get, you know, if sometimes, and one if not the other, and all that viceversa stuff.
landmarks
Is that Navi?
Hmm, maybe Menkar. Let me check that; see if Menkar -
It looks like we got a good - Oh, doggone it! First I got through was Hawaii. I go back down to...
How about that, San Diego?
No, the first one. I thought it was Hawaii, but it wasn't. It was San Diego.
point lower.
My, they are dim in here. Oh, let me sea if I can get it in the sextant.
130. Hey, querito ver Venezuela.
How about that? That ought to be a challenge.
It's a damn challenge.
That's right, because they (Laughter)
I can find San Diego.
By Jove! I've got it.
Querito ver Venezuela - south of Caracas.
Boy, isn't that a lovely reticle?
Yes, isn't that great? Thrilling!
If you turn it up bright enough, I guess it's alright, huh?
Well, you can find your star, but it just gets fuzzier.
Yes. So that's what Navi looks like. Okay. Now what? Back to zero first, then CMC?
The other way around. Zero first. To go to CMC, it takes the last stored value and drive over there, and then it'll drive back
Okay.
Well, Dave,
Where are - where are your targets?
Right there. Huh?
And it's north?
Yes.
No. (Coughing)
Hmm.
over there, Davey?
Huh?
over there?
Hey, where we going?
Going over to - Oh, look at that!
Oh, yes, let's see where it is.
You're on what?
I'm north of you. 78 north and 27
north?
Yes, you got 10 degrees below, haven't you?
to the horizon?
cranked up like - What are you going to do, 30 degrees then, 40 degrees?
Yes. roll.
About 20 or 30 degrees, yes?
Oh, about 50 or so.
the horizon is parallel to the bottom of the window and north.
Hey, since there's so many of those fruitcakes left, I may just take another fruitcake. That really tasted good.
Did it? Man alive, you can have all of mine.
Really?
Hey, give me a bite of it.
That's a deal.
Give me a bite out of it; I haven't had one of those things. a thousand of them.
Fruitcake?
Yes.
God damn! I'm going to - I'm going to add fruitcake to my diet. Hey, you know, we're getting compatible.
I can't believe it.
(Laughter) I don't particularly care for the hot chocolate. The only thing is that David likes the grape.
1 think the grape - I think the grape, and about all of them, I guess. I'm not sure that, if the color doesn't have a lot to do with it (laughter).
the color of some of this meat is peculiar.
Yes, oh boy. And they all have that same smell.
Don't they, though?
Wonder what it is?
I don't know. It must be something...
I wonder if they put something in them - Yes, I was just going to say, I wonder if they put something in them? Whatever it is, it dominates the flavor.
Boing! Here you go, my good friend, have an energy pill.
Hey, I'm ready for a drink.
and it takes a little jockeying. and you go around this way, if you want to get to the right spot. Why don't you...
Apollo 9, Houston. You're on your own; Guam at about 57.
Apollo 9, Houston. Standing by.
Roger. Guam at 57. We'll keep an eye on it.
Roger.
Roger.
When we come up over Guam, see if we've been into it or not.
Could give you an inertial angle. Rusty, because stay there, but -
Well, knowing the times, you can figure it out.
Yes.
That - The only reason I'm saying that is then you don't - then you don't have to keep flying it to keep it out of gimbal lock.
Yes, you could, go to INERTIAL...
Once - once you get in there, then it can take care of itself.
Well - that's right.
Oh, do you mean, do a P - VERB...
Well, you could do that. You wouldn't even have to do that, Jim, I mean - Just the fact that you could be in ATTITUDE HOLD, and go do something without, you know, without having to worry about it.
Apollo 9, Houston. We're copying a pretty good sized middle gimbal, there.
Roger. We're sort of moseying on over to correct attitude for landmark tracking.
Okay. good.
Good eye, though.
Roger.
You keep on us, Ron.
We'll try that.
It's going to come a day when we don't see it.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston. You're on your own. Guam at about 57.
Roger. Guam at 57. We'll keep an eye on it.
When we come over Guam, see if we've been into it or not.
Okay.
Okay, I'm going down and look at...
Yes, I'll be willing to do it.
Not bad. You drive.
You and I've got on the wrong side of the ball you got us here.
Well, I figured now I got you where you are all screwed up, see if you can work yourself out of the hole.
Well, that's what happened the other day, you see, when you said - when we did that one thing, and then we quickly did the other thing? Shoot, I the other side of the ball, on the wrong side where the red - while we're on the ball, go around the dot - (laughing).
Where's that bag full of hard?
copy bag, right here.
Not that old grab bag.
No, I think...
No, that's a new one.
Oh, look at here, would you.
saw some spaghetti go by. Hey, there you go.
What if I ate one of your spaghetti's? Would that make you unhappy?
spaghetti. Looks like we have 4 more days worth of food in here.
Do we really?
Yes.
Down here?
A third of the food is still down in there.
Oh, well, let's have at it.
Do we really?
Yes.
In addition to all this?
In addition to all that, there's a third of the food left. Look it.
We'll never make it.
doesn't have a single thing out of it yet.
People don't steal my
Boy, I'll tell you one thing that that LM needs is another set of
Boy, I gathered from the way you talk, you don't even know what's going on.
I used to watch the radar beacons go back and forth.
Good night!
I feel lots better about it, if you can Let's see, west is
the way with the pretty roll right, degrees
Got to keep track of all that. Hey, look
Inertial gimbal angle got screwed up? Worked out pretty well.
happened so fast that we didn't have time to screw it up.
I guess ORDEAL didn't - set right or at least we couldn't set ORDEAL on the way back, huh?
No, I don't understand what was wrong with it. It wasn't working at all. Then, when we got out there, it was working fine.
Yes. My guess is that we
Apollo 9, Houston. We are all smiling again.
really not convincing; you set it when you're off to the right there.
We fooled you, didn't we?
I want to know if there was anybody placing any bets on it.
I know you can't - you can't set it right, but I was off like 80 to 90 degrees or some big number
(Laughter)
Apollo 9. Houston.
Go ahead. Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger. Pretty smooth about walking that around there. I have one more target of opportunity.
Stand by.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. At time 195 43 32: it's the Amazon Delta, oceanography, five frames, 10-second intervals; it will be north 35 degrees.
Okay. Understand. 195 43 32: Amazon Delta, oceanography, five frames, 10 seconds Delta-T, north 35 degrees. And be advised, we kind of concluded after unfortunately having made the mistake that the Barbados oceanography shot on the last REV should have been 30 south rather than 30 north, at least from our map here. Unfortunately, we didn't realize that until we had already taken up north.
Okay. Let me see if you caught us again.
Yes, I'm not sure if that's right, Ron. They may have actually wanted the pictures well north of Barbados, but the Barbados were south of us.
By the way. I'd like to give you back your old COAS.
Okay, I'll take it.
Just set it up there.
Hey, somebody write down what I say; I've got the target and all that stuff.
Okay.
I'll do that for you, and I'll - I'll tell you - I can identify it, you know, and -
Alright. How about write - "Gees, I can't identify it; I can't identify it; I can't identify it." You want those comments, too?
Might as well. Part of the game.
What the hell is this doing down here? What did you write it on 195 hours for?
Well, I had - give me the time first, and you said "Roger" instead of and I had to write it down - (Laughter)
missed it by 4 hours.
Hey, 195:10 is when it says landmark track. Is that like right now?
What time do you do it, Dave?
About 195:22.
Well, okay, 22 is when it comes over the hill.
Oh, look at that. We're almost at the right roll angle.
We're just about right, aren't we, Dave?
You're pitched down a little bit farther than you were the other day, Jim.
Right. I'm - I'm getting it
It's almost like about 5 degrees, and roll just about right.
Yes, roll is good.
What did you say, Dave?
Oh, I can't see the horizon.
Let's see, you got to roll - Well, maybe as we go along here, in this inertial attitude...
Yes, it will come quick enough.
Yes.
You really like to have me up there a long, long, long ways, I'll tell you.
But you're fine, really.
Oh, yes,
I think it'll be just fine. Just fine, Jim, you're doing a wonderful job.
great, nice guy, doing a grand job.
Yes.
Oh, look at that, Jim. There's a line that goes all the way over the horizon to the north, the clouds out there.
Oh, yes, wonder what in the world that is?
That doesn't look like a contrail.
It does in spots, but in other spots, you can tell it's definitely not.
Yes.
Did you see that big white or was that Dave that saw it?
No, Dave saw it.
Man, you could see that from - must have been 3 miles long. Must have even been longer than that.
That would be a great picture. Among all the other great pictures.
One thing I don't think we are going to lack are great pictures.
If they all turn out.
How far north is it? 78 miles?
Right, 78 miles north.
Yes, you'll be able to see it over the
When these things get very far off track, we're going to get
Yes.
technique falls apart
Okay, you don't dare get any closer to gimbal lock then.
It's a very simple technique to take these two balls out the window.
Such a pretty little island.
Is it really?
Yes.
Boy, I tell you, I'd sure like to go visit some of those islands. Don't they look beautiful?
Right.
I think we've yawed! I mean, you know, not 90 degrees. Looks like we've yawed more than 90.
According to the balls, we're just about 90. I 2 degrees off.
Yes, I kind of believe you, but - I mean -
Apollo 9. Houston through Hawaii.
Hello there.
Hello there.
Roger. We're both right on that Barbados thing. The Island is actually south, but we wanted some pictures to the north for oceanography-type things.
Okey-dokey. That what you got. You got pictures to the north, and it's water and clouds.
Roger.
Ho hum, I think I'll take a 10-minute nap here, if Dave's got us to the right spot at the right time.
And, Jim, on that second landmark tracking thing, the weather is a little bit marginal on that one.
We're almost there, aren't we? yes, we're there.
Okay. I think our intrepid tracker can probably nail it down though.
Very good.
The marginal we handle routinely; the impossible we attempt.
I think we got 10 more degrees.
no, let me get my
Okay. Got you.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We're thinking of putting in a backup GDC align at 196 hours there - just to let you know. I'll pass up some data on it a little bit later on.
Fine. Okay.
And. Houston, just north of us right now by about 70 or 80 miles, there's a very, very symmetrical cyclonic pattern of clouds out there - anticyclonic, I'm corrected.
Roger
Okay, Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go ahead.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger. Go ahead.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 9.
Roger. I have you now. I read you a while ago, but you weren't reading me.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 9. How do you read?
Loud and clear, now.
Okay. Got five good Marks on Point Loma.
Hey, very good.
Gee, and the surf looks great down there.
(Laughter)
Apollo 9, Houston. I think you have to proceed on your display now for us to get the Mark data down here.
Oh, okay. I'm going to go all the way through the program. Right now
Oh, okay. Good.
Apollo 9, Houston. I've got the roll, pitch, and yaw align angles for your GDC align there, if you want to copy.
Okay, Go ahead.
Roger. Roll align, 246; pitch, 315; yaw, 051; the south set stars. We'd like to leave the CMC and IMU powered up for this alignment. Your GDC ball angles will be l80, 180, and 0.
Okay. I understand. Roll, pitch, and yaw at 246, 315, 051, south set stars. Leave CMC, IMU powered up, and GDC ball angles: l80, l80, 0.
Roger. And once you get to your GDC align attitude, can you hit us a VERB 06, NOUN 22 to compare the IMU angles with what we think they ought to be?
Roger.
9, Houston. That's VERB 06, NOUN 20, instead of 22.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Can you record these? And just to let you know what we think they ought to be - Roll ought to be 180.4; pitch, 237.5; and yaw, 0.5.
Okay. 180.4, 237.5, and 000.5.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston through Ascension.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Apollo 9. Loud and clear.
Roger. I don't know if I mentioned it on that backup GDC align, we do not - I say again, do not want you to cage the IMU.
Apollo 9, Houston through Guam.
Hello. Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger. We need your P22 data, there. If you just call it up again, I think we can get it.
Okay. In work.
Houston, we'd like to run this optics GDC align again on the next pass. We'll have to stay powered up until about 197 40 or something like that.
Roger. We concur.
And, 9, Houston. I have a target of opportunity.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. At time 197 13 00 it will be Equador, geology, ten frames, 10 seconds, on track.
Okay. 197 13 00, Equador, geology ten frames, and 10 seconds on track.
Roger.
And, Houston, 9. Those are the right numbers for the second landmark.
Roger. I guess just go ahead and call P22. That 89 just won't quite hack it.
Oh, okay. You want me to just read you the NAV 89? You want the whole P22 again?
No. Just call up P22 so we can get the Mark data.
Okay.
How far would you like to go in P22?
Just call it up. That's all we need.
Okay. Fine. And it was sort of cloudy over there, and I didn't get identification until we were just about overhead, but didn't get by part 2.
Also.
Okay.
Also, Houston, it appeared the time overhead was off by almost a minute.
Roger.
Apollo 9. Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. The computer is yours now, and we'll delay the E-memory dump and state vector update another REV here.
Okay.
And do you have any results at all on that GDC and align?
Yes. Just a minute.
I guess we went through it and learned a few things, I guess, relative to history and how the procedures have changed. We did it wrong the first time and we'll go back and do it right this time and then when we get back down we'll want to talk about it some.
Okay. I understand.
Houston, this is Apollo 9.
Houston. Go.
We'd like to work out a - We'd like to use the procedure that we used or worked out about 4 or 5 years ago on this thing and see how it compares. Okay?
Okay. I don't know if anybody has got that procedure around, but we'll see.
It all ends up the same way. We'll just use the same numbers and it should work the same way.
Okay. Very well.
We'll use the procedure and get you the right numbers. How does that sound?
That sounds good. And watch your global lock as you are maneuvering around. That's all we have got to say.
Yes. It dips right in there, doesn't it?
Yes. Gets pretty close, I think.
You'll really have a good time watching this time.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Houston. Go.
Roger. Can you get us another map update here?
Roger.
Here we go. REV 124: at 196 plus 29 plus 12; right ascension, 15 17; longitude, 112.6 east.
Okay. REV 124: 196 29 12, and the longitude is 112.6 east.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston through Hawaii.
Go Houston.
Roger. Our cryo plan this evening is essentially the same. However, I guess you noticed that the exhaust temperature on fuel cell 1 has stayed pretty much constant today. So what we would like to do is essentially maintain the same power load without any large changes, either up or down. So in addition to the power down procedure we had last night, when you power down your SPS stuff, put in burner 3 on MAIN A and put the rendezvous transponder switch to Power.
Houston, do you read Apollo 9?
Roger. Loud and clear. How me?
You're a little broken. I understand that when we power down the IMU in the SPS you want us to put the rendezvous transponder switch to Power and the burner 3 to MAIN A.
That's affirmative.
Okay. And on the cryos you want to let the pressure drop down between 190 and 200 on the hydrogen, and then we're going to turn one of the fans on until it's time for number 1, I guess.
No. We're going to use tank 2 again tonight. Tank 2 fan On just prior to going to sleep.
Okay, tank 2 fan On tonight.
Roger.
And, Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead. Houston, 9.
Roger. I guess our SO65 countdown here shows about 97, and you said 105. Can you recheck that?
Roger. We'll get it in just a second, and do you have any BIOMED data on the LMP, yet?
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 9, Houston. Still looks the same down here on the LMP.
Looks the same, huh? Well, he checked the electrodes and they are nice and damp and the electrode paste looks fine. Guess we'll work on it some more.
Okay.
Say, incidentally, that last bunch of landmark tracks was with the telescope rather than the sextant identification
Apollo 9, Houston. You faded on that one. Say again.
Say again, Houston.
Apollo 9, Houston through Redstone.
Roger, Apollo 9. Go.
Roger. I missed your last comment there in Hawaii.
Oh yes, I - I just mentioned that the second group of Marks on the second sight - for the Marks on the second sight that were made from the telescope, not the sextant, because of the visibility problem.
Okay. Understand. Incidentally, it looks like on that first set of Marks the 121 alarm would not have rung anyhow, even - even if we had not disabled it.
Well, that's very interesting. Very good.
Yes.
Houston, I checked the SO65 magazines and we are reading about 104 or 105.
Okay; understand.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Hello there, Alie; how are you?
Fine, Jimmy; how are you tonight.
Pretty good.
If you're ready to copy, I've got some block data for you.
Just a minute.
Okay
Okay. Go ahead.
Alrighty. 127 3 Alpha, plus 3l6, plus 1485 201 07 09 3147; 128 3 Bravo, plus 259, plus 1450 202 47 15 3839; 129 Delta Charlie, minus 220, minus 1600 204 35 30 4829; 130 Alpha Charlie, minus 004, minus 0270 205 00 37 5538; 131 Alpha Charlie, plus 120, minus 0325 206 35 07 4779; 132 2 Alpha, plus 264, minus 0280 208 13 15 3769; 133 Alpha Charlie, plus 231, minus 0589 209 41 36 4044; 134 1 Alpha, plus 286, minus 0680 211 16 48 3622. The SPS trims are pitch, minus 0.64; yaw, minus 0.94; and hold your readback for a minute.
Holding.
9, Houston. I would like to give you some pointing data here. It's going to be coming pretty close here on this Pegasus.
Okay. Have at it
At 197 plus 13 plus 00, if you roll 00.89, pitch 178.4, and yaw 062.7, you will pick it up at about 1100 miles. Four minutes later, it will be into 100 miles.
And your closest point of approach will be about 67 miles below it - or behind it, I mean - 77 miles below it, and 35 miles to the right.
Well, how about that. Let's see if I got the numbers right. 197 13 00. Is that the right time?
Affirmative. That's when it will be a thousand miles off, it really booms in.
I believe it. And then the roll - Say again the roll; I missed that.
Roll is 8.9 degrees.
Okay. Roll, 8.9; pitch, 178.4; and yaw, 62.7.
Yes. I don't know if you will be able to track it in or not, but it might be worth a try. Try a little Kentucky windage there.
Okay. We've a lot of windage up here.
Okay.
Hey, Houston, Apollo 9.
Houston. Go.
Here we've been trying to avoid that red dot on the ball all day and look what you gave us for yaw.
Yes; it's pretty close there.
We will watch it.
What kind of odds are you giving whether we go in it or not?
Well, the tracking is supposed to go the other way, and the yaw gets better.
Alrighty.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Apollo 9, Houston through Tananarive.
Go ahead, Houston; this is Apollo 9.
Roger. Apollo 9, Houston. I guess we have a few minutes here at Tananarive. We can get some of this stuff out of the way, I guess, just for planning purposes. When you get to Hawaii, we'll get the E-memory dump, the state vector update, consumables, and your PRD readings. I guess while we are here at Tananarive we can get the block data readback.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston. How do you read now?
Houston, Apollo 9. You are still coming through unreadable.
Apollo 9, Houston. How do you read now?
Reading a little better, Houston.
Roger, Apollo 9. Understand. Reading a little better. Communications here are not too good. Did you get a chance to see Pegasus?
Houston, how do you reed Apollo 9? We didn't get a chance to. We really didn't see it. We may have caught a glimpse of it, but we couldn't track it
Roger. Apollo 9, Houston. Understand.
Apollo 9, Houston through Guan.
Go ahead. Houston, Apollo 9.
Go ahead. Houston, Apollo 9. How are you?
Roger. Apollo 9, Houston. Reading you fairly weak. I guess we could use some of this pass to tell you what we are going to do over Hawaii.
Okay. Go ahead.
When we get clear signal over Hawaii, we'll do an E-memory dump, then a state vector update; and if you've got them ready, I'll get your consumables and PRD's. I guess this is a good time to remind you of the waste water dump. We want you to dump to not more than 20 percent tonight - not more than 20 percent, and remind you of the CO2 change in the water chlorination and termination of BATT B charge.
Okay. Very good. We'll terminate BATT B charge now, and understand you want us to dump to 20 percent tonight on the waste water.
That's affirmative.
Okay. We'll be prepared to give you an E-memory dump, and we'll be ready for state vector update. As soon as we are through with that, we'll give you the consumables
Yes. Roger, Apollo 9. We'll pick you up over Hawaii at about 25.
Okay. Very good. And we'd like to tell you that our GDC alignment, was successful.
Houston, are you still there?
Apollo 9, Houston. Roger. Still here, but we're reading you very weak.
Roger. We said the GDC alignment was successful
Roger. Understand the GDC align was successful.
Apollo 9, Houston
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We'll have to stand by for a few minutes on memory dump till we get through the keyhole. In the meantime, if you're ready on the consumables, we'll take that.
We're ready; you ready?
I'm ready.
Okay. Service module A, B, C, D: 52, 54, 45, 51. BATT C, pyro A and B; 36.9, 37.1, 37.1. And the injector temperatures, 5 Charlie and Delta: 4.9, 4.9; 6 Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta: 4.8, 4.8, 4.9, 4.8. The PRD's: commander, 31 20; CMP 61 22; LMP, 80 22.
Roger. Copy. Consumables; 52, 54, 45, 51; 36,9, 37.1, 37.1; 4.9, 4.9, 4.8, 4.8, 4.9, 4.8. And the PRD's: 31 20, 61 22, and 80 22.
That's Charlie.
Hey, you want some angles on the GDC align?
Okay. Fire.
Okay. 180.36, 236.10, 359.78. And that was after the maneuver to 180, 180, 0, which took us like about 28 minutes.
Roger. Understand. Those angles: 180.36, 236.10, 359.78
That's Charlie. And you want your block data back?
Okay. We might as well go ahead and get that now.
Hey, before you get that, the maximum radiation going through the anomaly was 0.037 RADS per hour.
Roger. Understand the radiation survey reading was 0.037 per hour.
Righto.
Okay. You can give me the block data readback if you like.
All right. Are you ready now?
Yes.
Okay. 127 3 Alpha, plus 316, plus 1485 201 07 093147; 128 3 Bravo, plus 259, plus 1450 202 47 15 3839; 129 Delta Charlie, minus 220, minus 1600, 204 35 30 4829, 130 Alpha Charlie, minus 004, minus 0270 205 00 37 5538; 131 Alpha Charlie, plus 120, minus 0325 206 35 07 4779; 132 2 Alpha, plus 264, minus 0280 208 13 15 3769; 133 Alpha Charlie, plus 321, minus 0598 209 41 36 4044; 134 1 Alpha, plus 286, minus 0680 211 16 48 3622. With a pitch trim of minus 0.64 and a yaw trim of minus 0,94.
Roger. Apollo 9, Houston. Copy correct.
Okay.
Okay. And we're ready for the E-memory dump if you'll give us the VERB 74 ENTER.
Okay. On may Mark. 3, 2, 1.
MARK.
Apollo 9, Houston at Redstone.
Go ahead.
Roger. We're not sure we got all that E-memory dump; would you do it again for us, please?
Oh, yes; we'll do it again.
Alrighty; that's very nice of you.
Pleasure. All set?
All set.
Roger. 3, 2, 1.
MARK.
Apollo 9, Houston. We're ready to give you a state vector if you'll give us ACCEPT.
Roger. You have ACCEPT.
Roger.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. You might be advised that we're reading Rusty's BIOMED now okay. Looks like Dr. Scott's operation was a success.
That's great. The operation was a success, but the patient died.
What we did was - We took Rusty's sensors and moved them over on Dave.
We figured he was the only one with a heart strong enough to beat through.
No wonder the doctors are scratching their heads.
Hey, ask the Flight Surgeon on duty there if he can unscramble all of our EKG's, and he always knows who's hooked to which COMM cable.
Yes, that's right. He's been able to do that.
Very good.
He knows you guys better than you do.
That's what bothers me.
Apollo 9, Houston. On that waste water dump, maybe I didn't make it clear. They want you to dump so that you have no more than 20 percent in the waste water. Dump down to 15 to 20 percent so that amount of water left at reentry will be correct.
Okay. That's what we'll do. We'll dump down to between 15 and 20 percent.
Alrighty.
Apollo 9, Houston. Your state vector is in, we've verified it for you, and you have the computer back.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 9. Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. One last question. We'd like to know how much Hasselblad film you have left.
I think we have about a hundred frames.
Roger. Copy one hundred frames, and we're about to lose you here at Redstone.
Okay.
Okay. We're still showing you in ACCET, there Jim.
Okay. We'll get out in just a minute.
Okay. We'll be losing you in about a minute here at Redstone. I guess it's time for you fellows to get tucked in for the night.
Okay. We haven't eaten yet, so we'll be up for a while, if you can get hold of us.
Okey-dokey.
Apollo 9, Houston through Hawaii.
Roger. This is Apollo 9.
We see that you all are not asleep yet, so we thought we'd give you a call and give you the update on the block data number 20.
Okay. Stand by one.
Alrighty.
Okay. Go ahead, Al.
Okay, It's on REV 127, and the updates are as follows: 127 Charlie Charlie, plus 17, minus 1650 201 21 04 3082. End of update.
Roger. 127 Charlie Charlie, plus 117, minus 1650 201 21 04 3082.
That's correct, Dave.
Okay. How's everything going down there?
Oh, it's going very quietly down here. How is it up there?
Oh, very quietly up here. We're just sort of regrouping and getting ready.
You're about ready to go night-night?
Well, we'll try to sort of get organized here so tomorrow night we can put everything in its proper place with a minimum of disturbance.
Dave, we'd like to confirm that you've got the H2 fans on in tank 2, and that you did do a canister change - CO2 canister change.
That's affirm. We did do a CO2 canister change on time and H2 fan - We haven't turned it on. We're going to turn it on just before we go to bed.
Alrighty.
Which will probably be in about 15 or 20 minutes.
Okay. We'll take a look at giving you an extra hour tomorrow.
No. I guess we'd just as soon get up on time tomorrow, and sort of get going so we have an even day tomorrow
Okay. We're with you.
Apollo 9, Houston. We'd like for you to go ahead and turn that fan on in tank 2 now, if you would, please.
Very well. Fan On now.
Roger. Thank you.
You are welcome.
Houston, 9.
Go ahead, 9.
Hey, Al. We just pulled the flight plan out and took a look at it, and there's really not much to do the first couple or three hours, so why don't you give us a ring about 209 in Carnarvon?
Dave. We'll see if we can work that one out. It looks okay from down here right now.
Okay. One thing we'd like to make sure we do tomorrow, is get all the SO65's done.
Yes; you bet.
Alrighty. And one wore thing. If you can't find any targets of opportunity for the spaceships, don't worry about it. We'll be able to take plenty of pictures.
Okay. Copy that.
Lots of things to take pictures of up here.
Show Biz.
