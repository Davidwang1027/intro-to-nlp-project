Apollo 9, Houston. Good morning.
Good morning.
A real short night.
9, Houston. About 30 seconds to LOS. I'll pick you up at Mercury at 53, and I'll probably have some flight plan updates for you there.
Apollo 9, Houston through Mercury.
Apollo 9. Go ahead.
Roger, Dave. On your H2 tanks today: after you've completed the H2 fan cycle, lock tank 1 heater in AUTO and tank 2 heater OFF.
Okay. Tank 1 heater at AUTO and tank 2 heater OFF, and you want us to run through the cycle again, is that right?
Yes, that's after you've completed the fan cycle ON.
Okay. What else do you have?
Okay. I have some flight plan updates here, and are you ready to copy?
Roger. Let's go ahead.
Okay. Page rendezvous-1: transfer sequence camera that malfunctioned during EVA to LM; leave best camera in command nodule. Over.
Roger. I understand. Transfer the malfunction sequence camera to LM and leave the good one in the command module.
Roger. Okay. And rendezvous-38, add: transfer the extra sequence camera fuse from LM to command module. Fuse is in LM data card kit.
Okay. Transfer the camera fuse from the LM to the command module in the LM data card kit.
Roger. And at time 104 plus 00, waste water dump.
104 plus 00, waste water dump.
Okay. And then you might note that the LM must be in high hit rate to update the AGS state vector from PGNCS.
And, 9, Houston.
Roger. We hear; I guess we learned that one the other day.
Yes.
I'm just making sure.
Okay; just making sure. And we're been talking it over down here and you have a GO to transfer to the LM without being connected to the command module umbilicals. That is, you can make the transfer with your helmets and gloves off, if you to desire. Might save a little time, there.
Okay. Thank you. We'll do that.
Okay.
9, Houston. We noticed the AUTO switchover to REG 2, and we'd like you to go back to number 1.
Well, that's very observant of you. We will do that.
Okay. Roger. We'll do that.
Okay.
And we're just about LOS. Ascension at 27. And you might be thinking about it - We can use the rundown on the crew health, sleep, and pills taken in the last couple of days, if you can give it to us there.
Okay. Let me ask you a question with the radiators there. Do you think we have a problem, or what?
We don't know yet, at this time, but I don't think so.
Okay. It's manually and - No, it's not a manual radiator operation, but the automatic switch is in RADIATOR 1 now. Okay.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston through Ascension. And I have a consumables update.
Roger, Houston. Stand by.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. Go with the consumables
Roger. GET 086 70 21 69 27 72 29 67 29 450 36 37 34 39 100 97 26 0820 588. Over.
Apollo 9, Houston. Did you copy?
Roger. I missed the third and fourth from the bottom. The percent RCS-B and descent ponds O2.
Roger. Percent RCS systems B remaining 97; O2 is 26.
Roger. Coming back; are you ready?
Roger. Go fast.
086 70 21 69 27 72 29 67 29 450 36 37 34 39 100 97 26 0820 588.
9, Houston. Your readback is correct. On that radiator flow control, we'd like to go back to AUTO now and see if it stays in 1.
Okay. It did.
Houston, 9, you read?
Affirmative. You say you went to AUTO?
That's affirm, and we're still in 1.
Roger. We copy.
And, 9, Houston. Did you get request there on the - your crew stratus when you get a chance?
Roger.
Okay, I myself feel fine. Been eating good - no pills and got about 5 hours sleep last night.
Roger.
Dave, I guess we missed the sleep here night before, also, if you can remember that.
Houston, 9. Are you still with us?
9, go. Roger.
Okay. Night before last I got about 7 hours sleep, too.
Roger. Okay. I've got yours now.
Okay. Did you get everybody?
Negative. I just got yours and that's all.
Really? Okay. I guess I'll let Jim give you a run down on he and Rusty again.
Okay.
If you're talking, Jim, I'm not reading you.
Are you reading us now, Houston?
I read you, Dave.
Okay. Let me check my friends here.
Houston, how do you read?
I got you now, Dave, - Jim; about 40 seconds to LOS. In Guam at 08.
Okay. I took an Actifed and two APC before I went to bed last night and the night before. I got 7 hours sleep the night before last, and 5 hours last night. Rusty took the Seconal last night, nothing the night before, and he got 7 hours and 5 hours.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 9, Houston through Guam.
Roger, Houston, 9. Go.
Roger. Davey. Tell Rusty we've got another new set of GO/NO-GO limits for rendezvous radar check after RCS SEP. Do you want to copy them down?
Okay. Stand by.
9, Houston. While you're digging out books there, I've got some block data for you also.
Okay. Give me the PAD's first.
Okay. On VERB 83 versus VERB 62, rendezvous radar check after RCS SEP: page 2 and LMP and CDR, rendezvous procedures; change limits R plus or minus 0.27 nautical miles; R dot plus or minus 6.0 feet per second. Over.
Roger. Understand. VERB 83 versus VERB 62, rendezvous radar check: page 2 and LMP and CDR, rendezvous; change limits R plus or minus 0.27 nautical miles; R dot plus or minus 6.0 feet per second.
Roger. These are the ones we had before flight. We didn't get a change to stick in your book there, so you can use your own ideas on them.
Okay. Fine.
What next?
Okay. I've got the block data, but before we go into that, it looks like your primary radiator outlet temperature was up to 51 degrees, so it was a valid switch to slow propulsion number 2. And we're still checking it to see what causes it, other than that.
Okay. Fine. Looks like it's up to about 47 or so degrees now.
Okay.
Thank you.
Do you want a block data now?
Affirmative. If you're ready.
Just a minute; give me 10 seconds.
Okay, Ron. Go ahead.
Okay. Area 057 Alpha Charlie, plus 115, minus 0319 089 19 18 4094; 058 2 Alpha, plus 263, minus 0270 090 5537 4094; 059 Alpha Charlie, plus 322, minus 0279 092 29 25 4094; 060 1 Alpha, plus 294, minus 0629 093 55 38 4094; 06l 1 Bravo, plus 335, minus 0629 095 29 25 4094; 062 1 Bravo, plus 327, minus 0625 097 0312 4094; 063 1 Alpha, plus 272, minus 0630 098 3715 4094. Pitch trim minus 1.07; yaw minus 1.12; and this reflects - no - I say again, no rendezvous maneuvers.
9. Houston. About 20 seconds LOS; Huntsville at 17.
Okay. I'll read them back to you when we get there. Okay?
Sure.
I think I've got them all, and understand reflects no rendezvous maneuvers.
Roger.
Apollo 9. Houston over Huntsville.
Houston, Huntsville lost a valid lock temporarily.
Huntsville LOS.
Huntsville valid two-way.
Apollo 9, Houston. Looks like we got about one and a half minutes LOS; we'll pick you up at Mercury at 26.
Roger. Mercury at 26, and you want me to read back some block data.
Roger, I can reed you good enough. Go ahead. I'll get what I can.
Okay. 57 Alpha Charlie, plus 115, minus 0319 089 19 18 0094; 058 2 Alpha, plus 263, minus 0270 090 55 37 0094; 054 1 Alpha Charlie, plus 322, minus 0279 092 29 25 0094; 060 1 Alpha, plus 294, minus 0629 093 55 38 4094.
Houston...
Houston, are you still with us?
Roger. I got you right now, but we're just about to get you - about 30 seconds yet so - We'll catch the rest of them over Mercury.
And I think we've lost you.
Apollo 9, Houston through Mercury.
Roger, Houston. Where'd we dropout?
Okay. Start with area 61.
Okay. 061 1 Bravo, plus 335, minus 0629 095 29 25 4094; 062 1 Bravo, plus 327, minus 0625 097 03 12 4094; 063 1 Alpha, plus 272, minus 0630 098 37 15 4094. Pitch trim minus 1.07; yaw trim minus 1.11; and no rendezvous maneuver.
Roger, Rusty. Your yaw trim there was minus 1.12, and this reflects no rendezvous maneuvers.
I got you.
Does that reflect the SEP burn at all?
That's negative.
Negative on the set burn also. Right?
Yes. You're sounding pretty chipper this morning.
Yes man, we is hustling.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Houston, Go.
Roger. If we can get into the LM a little early, I'd like to do it. Would you check to see what the descent battery power is right now, and see if we've got the margin to get in there a little early?
Roger. We'll check it, and let you know.
Apollo 9, Houston. Roger. There's no problem on descent batteries.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 9. Houston. About 30 seconds LOS, We'll pick you up Ascension at 02 - 03.
Roger.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston through Ascension. Standing by.
Roger. Houston, Gumdrop.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Lousy COMM here. About 45 seconds to AOS Guam at 44.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 9, Houston through Guam. Standing by.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Houston, how do you feel about the Gumdrop today putting the evap secondary water flow control to AUTO?
Roger. We copy. Stand by.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Houston. Go.
Roger. In case you wonder where we are, we're on page 10, rendezvous 10 of the checklist. It looks like we're running about an hour ahead of schedule.
Roger. That's good.
Spider, Houston. High bit rate.
9, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 9.
Roger. We concur with the evap water control to AUTO for Gumdrop.
Okay. Did you concur?
Affirmative.
Okay. Thank you.
Spider and Gumdrop. Thirty seconds LOS. Huntsville at 52, and low bit rata for Spider.
Why don't we go back and try B?
Okay. Go B.
Five square on B.
Okay.
Now I don't read you.
Rusty, did you check all the plugs and stuff? Why don't you unplug and replug?
Okay.
Hang on.
Try it anyway.
Loud and clear.
Hey, try mine too, will you?
Okay.
Okay, we can configure both the radio over here.
Loud and clear.
How now?
Loud and clear.
Okay. It looks like yours works, Jim.
Well, I'll be a son of a gun. I wonder what makes something like that fail?
I don't know. It's weird, isn't it?
Maybe to adjust it.
Let's get back on the VOX.
Okay.
Going off the air. Need another minute.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston through Huntsville. We copied there, but we don't know what you're having trouble with.
Okay, Houston, this is Apollo 9. Apparently both the push to talk buttons on the LMP side of the LM have failed. The one on the cable and also the one on the hand control failed and the only mode of transmission that he had was VOX.
Roger. We'll copy. We'll see if we can't do some troubleshooting for you.
Okay. We checked out the CDR's side and it seems to work okay.
Roger. Copy, Spider.
Reading you loud and clear.
Roger. Stand by on A. I'll try the other antenna here for you.
Okay. How do you read now?
Five-square.
Okay.
I'm on the right.
COMM checks incomplete, and I guess the only thing we found is that my PTT doesn't seem to work at all. Let me try it one more time here.
Okay, how do you read now? Gumdrop, how do you read, Spider? Gumdrop, how do you read Spider?
it doesn't work on PTT. Now interestingly enough, Jim - over to a Spider I went to - I'm on VOX now is that the intercom bus should not be triggered. The tape recorder does not go off. It looks like there's something funny, too. I'm sorry. on VOX, and on VOX the intercom bus should not be triggered except when I'm talking.. The tape is going off now.
Apollo 9, Houston. One minute to LOS. Mercury at 00.
Roger
It appears that the intercom has triggered, and yet the tape recorder does not go off. It looks like there's something funny there, too. I'm sorry; I am on VOX, and on VOX the intercom button should not be triggered except when I'm talking and yet the tape recorder does not go off.
Okay.
Okay. The tape has gone off now.
Roger. Data.
Roger. Received your telemetry well.
VOX sensitivity set.
mess around.
Okay. I guess I might as well leave all that aside.
Okay. Just a minute.
Apollo 9, Houston through Mercury. Standing by for P00 in ACCEPT.
Roger. You have P00 in ACCEPT.
And Spider is on also, Houston.
Roger. Got you, Spider.
Houston, Spider.
Spider, Houston. Go.
Roger. For your information the commander is - OSC is 5600 psi. I'm checking them out right now, so I'll read you the stuff
Okay. Go.
Spider, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. We'd like your CSM to LM power transfer time.
Roger. I think Gumdrop can probably give that to you a little bit better.
Roger.
An hour ahead, Houston. That's pretty good; that's within 5 minutes.
Okay. We'll take that.
That's a good number.
And I have your rendezvous PADS down there for the Spider and Gumdrop, if you're ready to copy.
Gumdrop's got to stand by.
What is it you want to give us, Houston?
Your rendezvous PAD for your DAP data load.
Stand by. Spider too. Gumdrop, let me know when you're ready.
Okay.
Okay. Spider is ready to copy anything you've got there, Houston.
Okay, Spider ready. Gumdrop, are you ready?
Houston, before we start on this is that you're going to give us?
Roger. This is your rendezvous PAD for your DAP data loads, CSM weight, and trim angles.
Okay. Gumdrop's ready.
Roger. I'll go. CSM weight: 27 009; LM weight 22 145; for Spider, GDA drive angles R1: pitch, 00428; roll, 00730; CSM trim angles: pitch, minus 1.00; yaw, minus 1.10; DELTA-VC, 16.1. Over.
That's - I'm sorry, that's SPS tail-off instead of DELTA-VC.
And, Houston, would you repeat the CSM weight, please?
CSM weight; 27 009.
Okay. Readback on the LM weight.
Let's...
LM weight: 22 145; CSM weight: 27 009; Spider trim angles are plus 00428, 00730.
Houston. Roger.
And for the Gumdrop, I have pitch trim of minus 1.00, yaw trim of minus 1.10, DELTA-V tail-off at 16.1.
Roger. Spider, you might make sure your LMP audio control switch is in NORMAL.
Did you get that, Gumdrop?
Negative. He faded on me, too.
Okay.
Spider, Houston. Low bit rate.
Hey, tape, in case you're working, I'd like you to know that the window shades in the LM are no damn good. They - they let in too much light for one thing; and, for another thing, they're extremely difficult to reinstall after you've taken them down one time.
And when you take them down, then they don't roll up.
Okay, and I guess we ought to also say a few other things here. When we put in the LDC DSKY circuit breaker, it turned out that even though we'd gone to STANDBY on the - system stage, we were not in STANDBY when we pushed in the LDC DSKY circuit breaker. It came up with a flashing 37 in P06, and what else have we got? The commander's OPS heater circuit breaker - or, heater test flight seemed to be either inoperative or intermittent, depending, on which time you do them. I couldn't get them to work at all today. They didn't work for me the other day, but Jim did it one time and it worked. Also, the - yes, excuse me - LMP PTT, either umbilical or on the ACA, is inoperative today, and the only way I can transmit is with the VOX, which works fine. Okay, tape, and you're going OFF at 89:36. 2, 1 -
MARK.
89:36 and you're going OFF.
Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston through Canaries.
Go, Houston. This is Spider. Reading you loud and clear.
Gumdrop.
Roger. I copy both you and Gumdrop. We want to update your Y-PIPA and, since we've got the REFSMMAT in there, we'll just have to punch it in manually. Do you want me to give you the address or do you want us to do it?
Roger. I'm up in the tunnel; why don't you all do it? Okay?
Say again, Gumdrop.
Roger. I said, I'm up in the tunnel. Why don't you all go ahead and do it?
I think that's a sterling idea. We'll...
You've got P00 in ACCEPT?
Roger. Thank you, Gumdrop.
Houston, Gumdrop.
Go, Gumdrop.
Spider's calling you.
Spider, this is Houston. Say again. I'm not reading you at all.
Do you read now?
Roger. I'm reading you loud and clear now, Jim.
Okay. I'd like to report that the heater indicator on my OPS does not come on. I'm planning on using Rusty's if we have to make a contingency transfer. We just got an AGS caution and warning light on. I don't know how long it's been up there. I just got suited up and turned around here.
Roger, Spider. I copy both those and we see the AGS warning light. We'll give you some words on it.
Okay. Roger, Stu. The AGS light did not light off a MASTER ALARM except when I turn the AGS on. My guess is that the AGS light came on and stayed on when I activated the AGS, but there's no way I can be sure of that.
Roger, Spider. Copy.
For your information, Houston, we're doing the pressure integrity check. We're just starting the pressure integrity check right now.
Roger, Spider. Copy.
Gumdrop, this is Houston. We're through with the uplink. Your Y-PIPA has been updated and the computer is yours.
Roger. Thank you.
Spider/Gumdrop. Bring up your S-band for Madrid.
Gumdrop, this is Houston. Do you read?
Spider, Houston. If you read, Rusty, check your suit isolation valve. We're showing it disconnected.
tape. The time is now 90:23 - and we just finished pressurizing the ascent system, and following that, we cycle the ascent feed valves, that already been positioned on the system's day, and I noticed that when we cycled - recycled the ascent feeds l, and the ascent feeds 1, in both systems open, that valves went OPEN. I could feel them in my feet.
Was that 9 - 90:24 - 90 -
Hey, let's see RCS cold Fire.
That's a swinging idea. Let me just make sure of that again now. (Coughing) I want these open. Okay. Okay, CSM MIN DEADBAND and ATTITUDE HOLD so...

I've already done that.
Have you reset the DET time?
No.
Okay. Those have been - We've been above 120 for an hour and 25 minutes right now. We ought to keep track of that.
Right. Okay, got that.

Okay, Thank you.
Roger.
And, Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston through the Mercury. Have you about 4 minutes, and I copied the CSM angles.
Okay. Are you ready for the IM angles?
Go ahead.
I'm going into the high bit rate for you first. LM angler 15476, 01907, 01305.
Roger. I'll read those back in just a second. We'd like to have a E memory dump. We're standing by any time on your Mark.
Okay. Stand by just one. Let us finish up the dock alignment procedure, and we'll be right with you.

E memory dump.
Okay, we got the E-memory dump, and that was - Let me get - I got TELEMETRY, HIGH. Have we got INSTRUMENTATION B, CLOSED? Oh, balls, we don't.
No, I don't know we need it on yet.
Well, it's supposed to be closed for the E-memory dump. Right there.
Wonder why?
Houston, Spider.
Go ahead, Spider.
Roger. I just noticed that we don't have R and D instrumentation B closed - or we did not have it closed for that E memory dump. Do you want to re-do that?
Why don't you close it now, Jim?
We'd like to have the E memory dump again. We had a drop out of telemetry, and stand by.
I'm not sure that the...
Disregard the circuit breaker; let us have the E memory dump.
Okay. I understand. Negative on the R and D B, and another E memory dump. 3, 2.

MARK.
And, if you would, please remind us to get that R&D B in at some later date.
It's in the flight plan right up here.
Okay. Spider this is Houston. We're not going to get it here. We'll see you over Antigua at about 03, and Spider, give us low bit rate if you read.
Roger.
Low bit rate.
Yes. We should have DSI VHF B on over Antigua.
Yes, okay. Well, I'm not sure, Jim; it's in the checklist, but I'm not sure whether a - because of the E-memory -
Yes. I think it's just - that.
That's affirmative, Spider. And Gumdrop, this Houston. If you still read me, we didn't give you a NAV check up, but we pulled a vector compare; it's real good. We're going to disregard it.
Gumdrop. Roger. Understand.
Gumdrop, Houston. We'd recommend AC roll.
Well, we're all through with all of our checks, except...
Gimbal drive.
frantic pass.
hours. Is that affirm?
Except the landing what?
Except the frantic pass.
Oh.
Antigua, Canaries, and -
Oh, we ought to be in good shape for that, too.
Yes. We do a PIPA BIAS check here.
Yes. Okay, let's do that. Where is it?
A REG check, too.
Oh, we got to do that damned REG check. PIPA BIAS check. Why don't we do that while we're playing with the DSKY?
Yes, then we'll get the REG check right after that. Then I think -
Gumdrop, Spider.
Yes, that's alright. Okay.
Go.
Roger. Are you in FREE?
I'm there, yes.
And are your rates less then 0.1?
Let me - let me.
Okay. a few little tweaks.
Okay, we'll advise when we've done our PIPA BIAS check for you.

Okay, stand by. Okay, Gumdrop, you're clear to do anything you want. We're done with the BIAS check.
Okay, that's different from the other day, isn't it?
It is.
Plus 05, plus 01, and plus 01.
That's a nine.
Hey, it's a nine. Thank you. Okay, do a VERB 06, NOUN 1, and let's look at it. 1452. It was 12 before...
3.
Okay, so we can alter that one, and that - that was a minus 3; that's now a plus 1. Okay, and let's do an ENTER; 1456, ENTER and check the other one.
Okay..
That was a plus 1, and it's still a plus 1. Good old Z. Okay, so we want to change X and Y. Okay, VERB 21, NOUN 1, ENTER. 1452, ENTER.
Plus...
09, ENTER.
09000, ENTER. ENTER 1454, ENTER. Plus 01000, ENTER. Okay, you want to check the VERB 06, NOUN 1; 1452. Let's see, what was that? That was - that was a plus 12 and a minus 3, wasn't it? And a plus 1?
Yes.
Okay, got in there. 9045.
Okay, want to do the REG check now?
Yes, we might as well. That's the only other thing that looks like it's going to fit up there. Boy, I hate to do that damn thing.
Oh, and an AGS CAL we can do too. Well, we might as well wait until they give us the torquing angle.
Yes, yes. Let's do the regulator check.
Oh hey, I can do the AGS initialization. Let me go ahead and get that thing going.
Let's - no - let's get the REG check out of the way. We've got just about enough time to fit it in here.
Okay.
I'd like to see it gone.
Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going to be off - hell, I don't know if I want to be off the loop. Oh, we don't pressurize on this one. Okay, I'm going to be on the loop.
Gumdrop, Spider.
Spider.
Roger, we're going to come up with our infamous bang again here in a few minutes.
I'm holding my breath.
You made a few yourself today.
Say again?
I say, you made a few bangs yourself today.
Oh, really. When?
You were making those docking latches.
I was checking a couple of them out there. They - one of them was a little sticky, but it works fine.
Okay, going off the air here, and you'll hear a bang in probably about 5 minutes. Okay.
Gumdrop, is the tunnel depressed yet?
Roller, tunnel's depressed, and I have a good hatch check, and the and everything looks good.
Okay, very good.
Okay. Tunnel hatch is closed, depress - CABIN GAS RETURN to EGRESS.
EGRESS, Crazy!
CABIN REPRESS to AUTO.
CABIN REPRESS is in AUTO.
Okay, PRESS REG B to EGRESS.
PRESS REG B to - going to EGRESS. Okay.
Okay, FORWARD CABIN DUMP valve, OPEN, and then AUTO at 4...
You know that's a bad way to do that. Yes.
Why?
Well, it could shut off all the flow in the suit.
Well, it's not so bad.
Ha!
Let me open up the -
Okay, now I want to go REG A to CLOSE when the CABIN REPRESS starts.
Okay, go ahead. You watching it today too, huh? Yes, okay.
Here it goes. Okay, we got the MASTER ALARM; I'll get that. Okay.
Okay. As soon as CABIN REPRESS starts, PRESS REG A, CLOSE; CABIN WARNING LIGHT, OFF; CABIN REPRESS stops; it does.
Alright.
CABIN REPRESS, CLOSE.
REPRESS going to CLOSE, here we go. Bang.
Okay, FORWD CABIN DUMP valve OPEN; and then AUTO at 3.5.
Okay.
You're going to have to read this one to me.
You want me to read this one to you?
No, tell me when we get to 3.5.
Oh, okay, yes.
Okay 3.6, 3.5 now.
Okay.
Okay. The suit's at 4.2.
Alrighty. And...
Get that big noise bank pushed out. (Laughter) Okay.
That's a piece of our ECF.
What is it?
I don't know.
If it's nonconductive, let's put it up through the ceiling.
Oh, shoot.
Okay, go ahead.
little bag.
Okay, OPEN then AUTO at 3.5. PRESS RED B, CLOSED. Oh, wait a minute. Okay, let me open it up and bring the suits down. Here we go. Okay, we're all the way down. REG B to CLOSE.
Yes.
Okay. Here goes the MASTER ALARM. Okay, you want to get that? I'll get it, yes.
get that.
Okay. Well, let's see, SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF, OPEN, then AUTO at 3.5; you've already done that. PRESS REG B to EGRESS. B to EGRESS, hell, we already did that. Okay, we're going back up.
Okay, now PRESS REG B to CLOSE.
Going back to CLOSE.

Let me just check everything.
Okay, it all looks good.
Okay.
Crazy. Okay, now I'll set my AGS start. How you like that, Davie?
Swell!
Okay, our CABIN PRESSURE is - Ohhh, that's okay, good. That too. Hey, my glove's coming off again.
We seem to have lost our Velcro off of there completely.
Oh yes. It's probably on the back of my camera. I put my camera on there. Hey, look at those pretty pink.
Yes.
Okay, the regulator check we did at 90:46 and 90:52.
Okay, I guess the first thing we want is the E-memory dump thing, huh?
Yes. Well, we've already done that though, we may not need that.
No, they didn't - I don't think they got it last time - again.
What makes you think that?
I think that they said that they didn't.
That's why we gave them the second one.
I know it, but they said they were losing us.
That clock's a little bit fast.
Not much, but -
What are we - one REV ahead?
Not quite, we're about. The AGS initialization would be in about an hour from now. No, it I wouldn't either. It'll be in about 30 minutes from now. We're running about 30 minutes ahead.
look like? Great!
Okay, so what do we want to do here, now?
Well, we want -
We want to see if they need an E-memory dump, I guess.
Yes, E-memory dump and then I want - to get the DPS GIMBAL DRIVE and final check all set up. We're back there.
And we've also got to get the up - update.
Yes, that's the big thing.
Yes.
You got to read the IMU gi - gimbal angles down at MCC?
We've already read them.
Yes, I guess we got those down over the -
Yes.
after the alignment after all. Okay. CD update. That's gimbal drive and throttle check. I guess we'd better get that.
Yes, okay. You want a setup for that?
Yes.
Okay, THROTTLE CONTROL to MANUAL.
Just a second. Let me find it here.
What page is it on?
Rendezvous 24.
Okay. Rendezvous 24. Then you want the THROTTLE CONTROL to MANUAL. Go ahead.
Okay, stand by, MANUAL THROTTLE to SYSTEM ENGINRER.
Okay.
TTCA, both, throttle up, MINIMTUM. Okay, that's as far as we can go. Now, I guess we can do the VERB 48, and we can be sitting right there ready to - well, but we don't know if they want to do the E-memory dump first.
Yes. Let's just leave it right here.
Yes, then we just go back into P00 here.
Hey, is that OPS on pretty good today?
I've got it on the same way I had it on yesterday with that piece of Beta-cloth netting hooked around the handle, so I hope it doesn't come out.
Okay, well, we don't ever - Oh! The ascent engine burn light..
For as little sleep as we got, I feel pretty damned good.
Yes, me too. I'm getting hungry. Getting hungry!
I've only been up 4 hours.
Have we?
Yes.
Is that all? Not bad. Let's see. Where are we here.
86:40 we got up.
Rendezvous radar. We ought to get that damned thing undone.
Yes, that comes - as we leave there, we can take and - thing is really printed neatly.
Hey, we want to get R&D B in now, Jim? Past that.
Yes, when we come up on -
Are we passed that time?
No, we have about another 5 minutes to go.
Oh, okay. You want to unstow that radar and slew it around?
Well, why don't we do it after we finish this pass? We got all this time here -
Fine.
Run a self-check on -
I figured we could play with it for awhile.
Run a check on stuff; and then when we come down here, we'll run another one.
Okay. How are you doing, Gumdrop?
Fine.
Okay. We're well up on the timeline here. This is our wild pass coming up; and after this, we need to do our AGS CAL, we've got to disable the B-3 thruster and do our rendezvous radar check and all that stuff.
Okay. I'm - right up with you by about 3 minutes.
Three minutes? What's he talking about there?
Well, he's probably following in the flight plan. He's probably one step behind us.
Oh.
Here, let me see if we bypassed anything now.
Okay, we've got everything up to this time.
Yes, that was my conclusion, too.
Okay, you want to rehydrate some food?
Well, we're just about at that pass. Why don't we go through the pass. When we finish it, at least get a drink. finish out that AGS initialization, AGS CAL - Well, we've got the AGS initialization, haven't we?
Well, no,...
No, we've got to update the state vector yet.
we had an update -
Take my helmet and gloves off and get a drink, anyway.
I'll tell you what. Hey, I'm going to put my window heater on.
Okay, why, you getting steamy?
Oh, I can see a little bit, of fog in there and I don't, know whether it's -
Gummy must be thrusting.
Yes.
Hate to see him thrust around very much just on the capture latches.
(Laughter) He's supposed to hold it.
Yes. I know.
Hello. Spider/Gumdrop, Houston through Antiqua. Do you read?
Gumdrop, five-square.
Oh, shoot.
Roger, Gumdrop. Do I have Spider with me? And as soon as we get data here, we're going to have that E memory dump again. Spider.
Oh, shoot.
They're - they're coming now.
I don't hear them. Do you hear them?
No, just a minute, let me switch antennas. Here they are.
Spider, Gumdrop. Houston's on the line, and they say as soon as they get data they're going to do the E memory dump again.
Roger. We're ready.
Okay, Spider. Do you read Houston?
Sure do.
Roger, Houston. Read you now.
Okay. While we're waiting on that E memory dump let me give you torqueing angles.
Roger. Ready to copy.
Roger. Torqueing angles: minus 00370, minus 00790, minus 00310.
Roger. Readback: minus 00370, minus 00790, minus 00310.
Roger. Copy. And we'd like to have high bit rate.
Roger. High bit rate.
Houston, did you ever find out anything about that AGS warning light yet?
Roger. We're working on that, and we'll probably have a procedure for you that might solve the problem - probably to turn it off and back on again, but we'll pass you the details later.
Okay.
VERB 42.
Okay.
VERB 42.
Houston, say again.
Spider, this is Houston. We are getting CSM data; we are getting no data from you. You might check the switches, please
Roger. Everything's checked out. We're in telemetry HIGH.
And Houston, RD Instrumentation B circuit breaker coming in now.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay. We've got our data. Spider, we're ready for E memory dump on our Mark.
Roger. 3, 2, 1.
MARK.
And, Houston, be advised that once again our supercritical.
Pressure doesn't seem to be working for the descent stage.
I'm sorry, Jim; I couldn't read that. Say again.
Roger. Supercritical pressure gage does not seem to be working for the descent propulsion system.
Roger. Copy.
And, Spider, we're reading 704 on the SUPERCRIT.
Okay.
Probably low.
Wail, we're blowing down anyway.
I know it, but that's still awfully low.
Yes.
It's going down...
I'll bet that's a big surprise to them all.
Yes.
Okay. Spider, Houston. The dump is complete. We're ready to uplink your state vector REFSMMAT.
Roger.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. It's on its way.
Houston, Spider. We're ready to copy the NAV check if you've got that.
Roger.
Reading the NAV check: 092 0000, minus 2799, plus 14631 1245.
Spider, Houston. Did you copy the NAV check?
Broke S-band lock. Houston, you reading Spider?
Spider, this is Houston. Try me again.
Okay, Houston. Spider's back on with you now. I got the time and that's all.
Roger. Reading: you have the time, minus 2799, plus 14631 1245.
Okay, you broke out again. I got the altitude that time. I got minus 027. Say again and all after.
Gumdrop, do you read Houston?
Spider, Gumdrop. Houston's breaking up on me, too.
Okay.
Okay, Spider. I've got you now. Try your readback.
Okay. I didn't get it; you're breaking up pretty badly, Houston. I get minus 027 and you broke up so say again all after, please.
Okay. Starting with the time: 092 0000, minus 2799, plus 14631 1245.
Roger. 92 0000, minus 2799, plus 14631 1245.
That's affirmative. Spider. Houston confirms the update.
Terrible.
Yes. We're going to have us a problem; I can see that.
Yes. The S-band seems to be on.
Did you notice what the first - whether that was a REFSMMAT or a state vector?
No.
That was a state vector.
Okay. Spider/Gumdrop, I've probably got you solid now. How do you read me?
Better now, Houston. You're better.
Almost five-by.
Very good.
Come on, baby, get in there. I'd better get an update form ready.
Yes.
Okay. Spider, this is Houston. We've got the state vector in, we have VERB 66ed it, and we're going to hand over here within a few seconds, and then we'll put in the REFSMMAT.
Okay. Roger.
Okay, there it goes. 24; come on, baby. There we go, 7035. Beautiful. Okay, and it's got to work its way up to 331.
Spider, Gumdrop. I have a good transfer now.
Very good. In just a couple minutes we're going to find out if we have a good radar.
Okay. We're ready to go the gimbal drive and throttle test. VERB 33, ENTER.
Do you have that pad out so that we can verify the stuff in here, when we go through it?
Okay, Houston. Let us know when you're ready for the gimbal drive and throttle.

Okay.
What's the trouble with COMM here?
I don't know. You got real weak on me, but good data across on you there.
And then it came in good when we handed off to Madrid.
Okay. And we're probably going to lose Madrid shortly, and we'll see you over Carnarvon at 51. The first look at your checks look real good, Spider.
Houston, this is Spider. You're unreadable.
Okay, Houston. Say again the time.
Roger. We'll see you at Carnarvon about 51.

Okay, UP.
And Spider, give me low bit rate
Roger.
Okay. Low bit rate.
Got that one.
And we just about used it up that time, troops.
Yes, I sure would appreciate it if we had better COMM.
So would I.
Okay, that - the NAV check is a GO.
Gumdrop, this is Houston. Did you get a C and W right at the end there?
Negative.
Okay. Thank you.
RESET that damn heater light again.
Should I have?
No. No; the H2 heater cycle D and we are curious whether you got it or not.
Okay.

Yes, I think we've got everything done up to the ACS CAL.
Yes. AGS initialization, too.
Yes. Let's do that, and I'll get into HIGH bit rate again. I don't think we're supposed to go back to LOW - Oh, that's alright. I'll go to HIGH bit rate now, and we'll do that. Yes.
Okay, Gumdrop, this is Spider. You can start getting us into our AGS CAL attitude now.
Okay, Roger.
AGS calibration.
Okay, I'm getting that.

I want to bring the rendezvous radar on the line here. Hey, Gumdrop, would you disable your P-3 thruster? We're going to unlimber the radar here.
Hey, Gumdrop, would you disable your B-3 thruster? We're going to unlimber the radar here.
Roger. It is disabled.
Roger; thank you.
Okay, veri -
You know something? That...
COMP ACTIVITY light...
Check your transponder. It'll be off, too, please.
Roger. Transponder is off.
that COMP activity light stays on a long while; I'm wondering if they gave us a state vector that's more than one REV ahead.
Okay.
They can do it more than - more than one REV ahead, just can't give it more than one REV behind.
But this integrates it one REV back. That's the point.
Oh.
I'm going to ask them about that, next station.
Okay. You want to do the radar now?
Yes, let's do the radar now.
Okay, the update went across when we checked the orbit. 127.1 by - Hey, Jim. It didn't flash, did it?

You can tell me whether it goes too far or not far enough.
Go.
Okay?
Go.
That's fine.
That's fine?
Yes.
Okay.
Oh boy, is there a crop on that telescope! Whooee!
Really?
Yes.
Let me see it. Oh, and the EVA - Oh, well it's not going to be there. There's a black spot.
That's great.
Okay, VERB 44 - Let me check the VERB - 16, NOUN 72, ENTER. That's good. VERB 44, ENTER. Okay, now I'm going to put it to the 323 here.
Okay.
VERB 41, NOUN 72, ENTER. Plus all zeros.
All zeros.
ENTER, plus 323...
ENTER, plus 32300.

Go.
PRO. VERB 16, NOUN 72. Okay, it's there. PGNS, RENDEZVOUS RADAR, OPEN, and then the AC. Oh, damn it!
Leave it OPEN.
Doggone it. I wanted to see if it stayed there when we did that.
Ah! Okay, let's press on with the card here.
rendezvous radar check...
Want to check the AGS? I've got the AGS calibration ready to go.
trans.
Oh, shoot, you're breaking up now.
No, I turned it down a little bit. Gumdrop, how do you read?
5 by.
Did you get - We're done with our rendezvous radar checks, and you can activate your transponder.
Oh, wait a second, Gumdrop. Leave it off for a while. We may have to run this again. They want this run over a station. I wanted to run it to see how it worked.
Okay. I'll leave it off.
Okay, let's remember that.
Yes.
Let's run the AGS initialization, AGS CAL.
Okay.
We're going to start running that AGS CAL here in just a minute, Dave.
Okay.
You want to verify those?
Hey, we're pretty close to - in one of our gimbal angles. Yes.
Both of them.
Both of them.
Are you really?
Yes. We're at 275 on one.
Yes, all of them are that way.
Heck, I'm not even that close.
Uh oh. Yes, one of them is 17 degrees off; that's not bad. The other's 13 degrees off, and the other's 5.
Okay, Gumdrop, this is because of that 90 degree rotation again, I think.
Yes. You see, I'm sitting on - sort of a 22 degree - degree offset from 000 inertially.
We're - we're not in good shape over here.
Okay, we've got to make one of them change. It's going the wrong way right now.
Okay, that one's okay. Let's see, that's - outer - which is - Where do we want to be? That one's okay, isn't it?
No, that's the one that's wrong. That's the 90-degree mark right now.
Oh, yes, okay. Let's see that's R, roll, so that's going to be closest to his...
His yaw.
yaw, okay.
Check your yaw.
Dave, are you yawing at all?
Yes, Roger, I'm trying to go the way you are saying.
Okay, fine. Okay, we've got that number increasing now so -
That's the best way to go, huh?
Yes.
Check. They're all going the right way, and we'll let you know when we get there.
Lighting check.
How about doing a landing radar self-check while we're waiting.
Yes.
Can't do that though. We got to do the lighting check at night.
Yes. We also have to do the landing radar self test over a ground station.
Oh, okay.
You want to get me a drink of water, maybe, and a -
Okay. Let me see how the rendezvous radar - Okay, it came up to 40.
Tell you what, I'm going to do another AGS update I here, while we're waiting.
Okay.
How you doing?
We're - we're 5 degrees; we got to go another - about another 10 degrees at least in - in your yaw.
Roger.
How are the optics looking, Dave?
Okay, it's 124 by 128 now, so that's a lot better.
Okay.
Are they in the ball park?
standby.
Okay, we have about 3 - we really have at least 3 more degrees in the direction that you're going.
Okay.
How are those doing? Okay that's 19 and 20 -
They're doing great.
Okay, yes.
Well, we're right back on the time line again. No matter now - how you hop to get ahead, you just can't get ahead.
How's everything running over there, Dave?
Everything's running just fine. Nothing at all seems off nominal. I don't know where they get their caution and warning idea, but everything seems inside the limit. Well within sight.
Okay, what he said was that one - that hydrogen fan came on, and they thought may be you might have gone down below the limit, like it had been.
No, it stayed right in the middle. Right there.
Boy, that COMM is terrible.
Sure is.
Okay, Dave, can you kill everything but your yaw rate and leave just a little bit in the same direction you are going in now.
Okay.
I got 0.05 in yaw directional.
Okay, good.
Balls, I'm sitting here sleeping.
Okay, we're going to do a VERB 40, NOUN 20.
I'm checking out the ORDEAL, in case you see my ball wiggling around.
Okay. Okay, Dave, you want to disable all your thrusters?
Okay, going FREE.
Okay, and we're starting the CAL now.
Okay.
Bias has stayed exactly the same.
The other one did?
No, all of them...
Oh, good.
stayed exactly the same.
Good.
do that landing radar self-test?
That's what I was thinking. Why don't we gin that up...
Okay. Here we go.
This one's...
CROSS-POINTERS both to HIGH MULT.
45. Let's - let's see what we have to do, there.
Okay, there - We've done that before in the middle of the CAL.
Yes. No, I - I was just wondering if they want it over the ground. I think this - Let's just press on with it, and to hell with the ground. CROSS-POINTERS both to HIGH MULT.
Okay, HIGH MULT.

Okay.
This where we go?
CAL is complete there, chiefs.
Okay
Spider/Gumdrop, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
Say again.
I say.
Okay. You're on the air all the time.
Yes; I notice that now. Thank you.
I think I use my VOX, and I forget to switch once and a while, so if it sounds like we're chatting here, let us know during the rendezvous.
Alrighty.
We're close enough now; we don't need a mike.
Gumdrop/Spider, this is Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
Roger, Houston. This is Spider, here. We just finished our landing radar test. We got the rendezvous radar test one time and it looks pretty good. We could do it again for you if you like. We're getting the AGS CAL data for you right now.
Roger. Understand. And we'd like to have high bit rate, and leave it on from now on.
Okay. High bit rate from now on.
How about that R and D B. You want that on from now on?
That's affirmative, Spider.
Okay?
Okay, Houston. If you don't have any higher priority here, I got the AGS CAL data.
That's number 1 on our list, Spider. Go.
Okay. Before the CAL, the bias were, respectively, 00 and minus all 7's.
All right. Copy.
The drift coefficient for plus 407, plus 30, is 28 and pull all zeros.
Okay. Copy.
The CAL: The bias coefficients were plus 0, plus 0's, plus 0's, minus all 7's.
Copy.
The coefficient for plus 0019, plus 0013, and 00001.
Roger. I copy those, Spider. Thank you very much. Pause]
Okay. And I we got a question for you.
Go ahead.
Here we notice in updating the AGS that the computer activity light was on for a very long while. I wonder if maybe you updated our state vector more than a rev ahead, and then by doing a VERB 47 we intergrated it backward too far. I wonder if you could have someone look at that.
Did you get that one?
We copy, Spider. Stand by.
Okay. It's just a question of whether VERB 47 hurts us, when we do that.
Roger. We can verify our state vector was not - was not more than a rev ahead, and we'll - We copied your question on the VERB 47.
Okay. As long as it was not more than a rev ahead when you updated us, there should be no sweat.
Roger. Copy.
Okay, did they want...
Houston, Gumdrop.
did they want to do a radar test?
Go, Gumdrop.
My fuel cell 2 condenser exhaust temperature is a tad high. What's it look like to you?
Roger, Gumdrop. We've been checking that. It is running a little high. We think it's going to hold okay through the rendezvous.
Okay; fine. It hasn't changed such during the last 30 minutes. I just thought I'd make sure of it.
Roger. It's been cycling with the night/day cycle. We even think it's slave to the radiator.
Okay.
Houston, this is Spider. Do you want either the landing radar or the rendezvous radar self-test performed again over the site?
That's a negative. Spider.
Okay. Great.
Gumdrop, you're clear to turn your transponder on then.
Roger. And I also expect DUPLEX A, and we'll see.
We'll be going together this time.
Okay. Fine.
Okay, let's get our B transmitter on - our B receiver on, too.
Right.
We'll configure the same way; we will be - receive A and B and transmit A.
Okay. And the transponder power is ON.
Okay.
Okay. Gumdrop, are you ready to support a lighting check?
Ready to support.
Okay, We're going to turn our tracking light on now; see if you can see it.
I don't see anything flashing, do you?
look down at the porch, Jim.
Would you believe it's not flashing?
I don't see anything.
Either that, or we can't tell, huh?
I don't think it's flashing, Rusty.
I can feel it going, can you feel it?
I don't see anything either.
I don't see it either, Dave. Just a minute.
What circuit breaker is that on?
Uh -
Lighting? Let's see, the docking.
Track, over here. It's closed.
Houston, are you with us yet?
Houston, Spider. Do you read?
Houston, Gumdrop.
Houston here. Go ahead.
Okay. It didn't look like our tracking light was on. I think I might see it right now, though. Yes, Dave, I think I see it flashing.
Roger. Copy. And we'd like to have your S-band volumes up at about 57. We'll be in Honeysuckle in about a couple of minutes.
Okay.
Okay.
Dave.
I see a reflection.
a regular reflection -
on one of the quads out here, so I think it is flashing.
Yes, I've got it now, down by the porch now.
Yes, I can too, Jim.
Boy, it's sure not very bright, is it?
It sure isn't.
No, it doesn't seem to be.
Its very directional, I'm sure. Okay, here come the docking lights.
Okay. Going to a docking light.
Okay. I've got one of them on the right.
Okay. That's good enough. We'll leave the docking lights on for you.
Okay.
Okay. Why don't you give me your lights?
All right. Here comes my monitor lights.
I don't see anything.
Answer what they call.
Yes, I will. I don't see anything up there, Dave.
Okay.
It's - it's on the other side of the spacecraft, Jim.
Okay.
I don't see anything here, either.
No, neither do I. Your spotlight doesn't work at all?
Great.
What's that?
The EL antenna.
Yes.
Okay, I see the EVA light. That's all I see.
Okay.
Yes, that's okay. I'll probably be just about right for EVA.
Okay..
What's that?
10.
Okay.
I think we're getting interference from that other transmitter of his.
Okay, don't forget to put the docking target up.
Okay, very good.
Okay, PREP for undocking.
Let me...
Configure the cameras. You got everything checked off there?
Well, let me look and see.
Okay. Spider/Gumdrop, Houston through Honeysuckle. How do you read?
Okay, you want to take a look at the docking target?
Okay, go ahead. Ooh, is that ever bright!
That's least.
What did you say?
That's dim.
I said give me bright.
All right. There's not much difference between them.
Boy, that thing is really off, Dave. When we come back and try to dock, you are really going to have to keep an eye on me. As a matter of fact had shifted a little bit from when I looked over it yesterday, I think.
Not too much.
All right. It's pretty stationary there. It's just that the isn't pointed in the right direction. Looks like I'm getting dangerous. I'll just attitude hold and you can do it.
Okay.
Spider/Gumdrop, Houston through Honeysuckle. I have your phasing PAD when you are ready to copy
Roger, Houston. Stand by. I'll get out the phasing PAD.
Standing by.
Hey, Dave, did your spotlight ever work at all?
No, it hasn't.
Hey, tell Dave that we're ready to do a phasing PAD.
Hey, Dave, I think we're going to...
Dave, how about the phasing PAD? Are you ready to copy?
send up the phasing pad.
I can't hear him now.
S-band, S-band.
We're on S-band.
Gumdrop, Houston. How do you read?
Okay, now that I have the volume up, I read you pretty good.
Even though I have my volume up on it, I can't read.
Spider's ready.
Gumdrop ready.
Roger. Spider/Gumdrop; reading phasing PAD: 093 47 34 00, plus 00 009 all zips, minus 00 907 00 907 000 286, plus 00020 all zips, minus 00907. Your SEP time: 093 02 5300; TPI 0: 094575300. End of update.
Roger. On the readback we've got 093 47 34 00, plus 000 09, all zips, minus 00 907 00 907, all zips 286, plus 00020, all zips, minus 00907; TPI: 0945753.
Okay, Rusty. Read me your SEP time again. We dropped it there.
Roger. SEP: 93:02:53.
That's right. Houston confirms the PAD. It looks good.
And Gumdrop copies.
Hey, did you agree with the SEP time, Dave?
I agree with the.
Okay.
Are you transmitting B?
Negative.
Okay. We've got a change in our COMM since we reconfigured here. I was just trying to figure out why.
Okay. I'm transmitting on.
Gone, nothing.
We - we don't have - the VHF B transmitter to DATA do we?
No. Okay, you want - You don't want that up there now, do you?
This thing?
Yes.
No have it up there.
You want to stay in 83, here?
For a little while, yes.
Okay.
Okay, since we don't need this anymore, I'll just deposit it down here.
Okay, PREP for undocking. Ready?
PREP for undocking. Roger.
And, we're about a minute off Honeysuckle, here, so we'll see you over the Mercury about 10.
Tananarive.
Gumdrop. Copy.
This is Spider. Roger.
Okay, - configure the cameras. I got those, and would you believe we got the right magazines on both cameras?
I can't, I can't, I can't!
That's hard to believe - Go ahead, Houston, Spider.
Okay, hold up, Okay, CSM configure for DUPLEX A and RECEIVE A only, and I think he is. LM configure for basic COMM with VHF B backup. Got that. Audio VHF B to RECEIVE, VHF B TRANSMITTER to VOICE, VHF B RECEIVER this - there's no sense in putting the transmitter on.
No, we're not supposed to have that on.
Mount the phasing pad. Set the DET for the RCS SEP time. Okay, SEP time is 93:02:53. 93:02! My aching back! Okay, that's right.
And use 25 minutes before that.
93:02:53, so it's going to be 57 minutes.
Have you figured out how you want to configure yourself to look through the AOT, Jim, as far as restraints are concerned?
I think I'll just take them off, Rusty.
Okay. And Gumdrop, whenever you get your clock set you can give me a hack for the time to SEP.
Will do.
Okay, OVERHEAD HATCH, LOCKED. OVERHEAD DUMP valve in AUTO. PRESSURE REGS A and B in CABIN; LIGHTING EXTERIOR to DOCK; ATTITUDE CONTROL, three, to PULSE.

Okay, RENDEZVOUS RADAR to LGC.
It's there. LGC.
And verify the undocking attitude. Okay, now that's going to be a little bit different this time. It's going to be different by -
How many - how much are we off in minutes?
We're off in minutes by - on phasing we're off by 3 minutes exactly, so it's 12 degrees. So instead of being 16, and that will he something different.
Say, we're out by 4, 9351 against 9347.
47. Yes; 4 minutes, 16 degrees. Okay. CB(11) R&D INSTRUMENTATION A, CLOSE.
CB(11) R&D INSTRUMENNATION A, CLOSE. Okay?
Okay, by damn, there it is. Put my checklist away here. Boy, you just can't - I can't even get into that pocket. (Laughter)
What are we set up there for; the phasing or the separation burn?
Separation's - Okay. I think I'll put my gloves on for undocking. Okay, Gumdrop; this is Spider here. We're all set up ready to undock. Hey, you done with the 83?
Let me check it one more time. No, I'm not going to be doing that.
Spider and Gumdrop, Houston through Mercury.
Roger, Houston; this is Spider.
Houston, Spider. How do you read?
Read you loud and clear, Spider. This is Houston. You are GO for undocking, you are GO for 78 dash 1, your AGS is GO. You can just unscrew the bulb if that light bothers you. And would like to inform you that during the phasing burn and probably also during breaking, you can anticipate a heater CAUTION light coming on. This will be from the RCS and this is after looking at the data that we've got here. There'll be no sweat.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay, let me read SEP 1: Prepare phasing pad. We got that. Set cameras. Verify CB(11), STAB/CONTROL AELD, OPEN.

Mark.
1 second off.
Okay. We're off by about a second.
Okay.
Hey, you sure sound funny all of a sudden; say something again.
Okay. Something again. I just switch to the other...
All right; you sounded garbled.
Good.
Yes, that clock is 1 second fast, Jim, here. We could go to STOP then START again - on it.
Houston, Gumdrop.
Spider, Gumdrop.
Spider, Gumdrop. You been able to contact Houston?
Houston. Spider. Do you read?
Spider, this is Houston. I'm reading you loud and clear.
Roger. Gumdrop's trying to call you.
Houston, Gumdrop.
Gumdrop, this is Houston. How do you read?
Loud and clear; and me?
I'm.
You're breaking up slightly and way down, Gumdrop.
Roger. That fuel cell 2 and I've got a fuel cell 2 light. Just thought I'd let you know.
Say, that can sure change radios fast.
Roger. Understand. Fuel cell 2 light and that's from the TCE?
That's affirmative.
Oh, no.
Okay. And you're loud and clear now, Gumdrop.
Okay.
You're still a little garbled to me, Gumdrop. Whatever you did in the last few minutes, it sure changed the character of your radio.
Let me go back the other way.
Gumdrop, it wasn't that; it was when you switched to the rendezvous configuration, I believe.
Roger. Let me try it the other way.
How is it now?
What?
Just that -
It's about the same.
Okay.
Wonder what changed?
Now it changed.
Maybe he changed something on his COMM configuration.
I didn't hear what he said.
Well, that was from one panel to another. You want to get that - you want to set the mission timer; right, Jim?
Yes, let's see what it is. Let's - get up -...
Oops - VERB 16, NOUN 65, ENTER. I think you can go to STOP and START VERB; just 1 second.
Seems about a half a second off.
Well, why don't you just flip it there.
Let me see what we can do here.
Rats, now it's a half a second off the other way.
Gumdrop, Houston.
Houston, Gumdrop. Go.
Okay. That TCE's hanging right on the ragged edge, Dave - on that caution and warning trip. And we'll be keeping an eye on it for you, but it might trip off here a couple of times during the rendezvous.
Okay; very well. Thank you.
Roger.
Okay, we'll be fast.
No, no fooling around.
And, troops, I'm going to lose you here. We'll see you over the sunny Grand Bahamas at about 36.
This is Spider. Roger.
Roger.
Gumdrop.
Okay; let's continue on down here then.

VERIFY the DAP at 01002.
01002. Okay, we look pretty good.
Okay.
Spider, Gumdrop. I'm going to start maneuvering for the undocking attitude.
Okay, fine. We're all all ready to go here.
Okay. Very good.
You know something?
What?
My FLOW CONTROL valves have been in VERTICAL since yesterday.
(Laughter)
No wonder my fingers are warm.
It also helps a little with the COMM.
I had my volumes all the way up already.
Really?
Yes.
Okay.
VHF A, B, and MASTER are all full UP.
Okay, I'm pretty far down on all of them.
How are the reflections in the window?
Terrible.
Are they?
I'll get into right configuration here and see how they are.
Yes, I've got my side panels OFF now.
I cleared my ears; that might help.
Ha, - the reflections?
Yes, that makes the reflection a lot less. They're not too bad. I can see you, all of you.
Here, let's turn this around so it doesn't shine on you. Yes, there you go.
That helps a little.
Man, this is going to be a long hungry day; I can feel it already.
9 hours to go almost.
Huh.
I know what I want to do. I want to look through here.
I don't see much out there.
Would you believe our radar is back up in view again?
Yes, well, it's supposed to be. It's not all the way up, is it? It's on the bottom of the field?
Yes, it's in the bottom of the field.
Okay. That's where we put it 323, not the 283 -
Uh huh.
And with his light shining in, it shines right in to the - right into there, so I can't see anything.
Let's hope that 283 is better.
What's that?
Okay, let's hope that the 283 is better.
Yes; well, with his light shining in the telescope I couldn't see anything anyway.
Oh, he's got his lights on, huh?
Yes.
Can I help you back there?
No, I just want to get the eye patch out.
What's he got his docking target on?
There's e - EVA light ON.
(Yawn)
That's on the EVA RUNNING LIGHT SWITCH.
Hell, he didn't - oh. - Uh huh.
Boy, that stuff up there is really all reflected in the window.
It is?
Yes.
How's that?
Looks better.
Okay, how's that?
Looks better. I can see all of it. Wait a minute.
Yes, we got everything up pretty bright.
You know that doggone AGS light doesn't help any either.
(Laughter) Yes.
Punch something up on your DEDA. Let's say -
Okay?
How light. How bright the lights are. I'm going to power up the -
Yes, the balance is pretty good.
Yes.
The trouble is we're going to undock in the daytime, so we're going to need it up bright.
Yes. I just wanted to see what it looks at night.
Yes. You can turn your side panels off, too. That will help.
Yes.
Matter of fact, the DSKY goes off before the DEDA does.
Yes. That - that's a switch.
Gumdrop, we've got 41 minutes to the SEP BURN.
MARK.
Right with you.
ful.
What kind of stars have we got out there? There's the Big Dipper right in front of us. right in front of us. And there is -
and about 15 more degrees to go.
Okay.
There's Leo.
There's Corvus.
There's really a bright planet out there. What the heck planet is over by Leo?
The Moon looks like it's around over in Spica -
Leo, near Leo has got to be our friend; isn't it Venus? Really bright.
Yes, very bright.
I can't quite see it. Oh, yes, it's down there. Let me see if I can see him out here. No, I can't because of the camera. Yes, that's Venus. He's minus 4.3 magnitude; would you believe that? Okay, our attitude is - it's not 180 yet, but it's getting there. 300, and we're at about 14. Let me see the PGNS.
He must be in WIDE DEADBAND.
Yes, I'm sure he is.
I sure wish we had those letters on there.
Yes.
Damn it; oh, is that in the Systems Book?
Yes, it is.
You want to try to do that now?
Yes.
Okay.
Can you get the Systems Book?
Yes.
Here, I think I can probably get it easier than you.
Oh shoot, I can't quite reach it. Okay, it's - it's the top one. That's it. Okay, I got it.
Okay, if you want to read them to me out of - on that diagram, hold on; I want to take off my gloves, and I'll write them up there.
Say again, Dave.
activity up.
Okay.
We're on the NOMINAL along there.
Yes, we should be, as far as attitude and stuff goes. Okay?
No, we're 4 minutes early.
Oh, it doesn't make any difference. They REFSMMAT us to a different place then. Okay, SYSTEMS A QUAD 1 is UP and FORWARD.
Quad, let me see where I want to put it now. QUAD 1, okay, 1 is and FORWARD. There. Okay.
QUAD 2, SYSTEM A is AFT and DOWN.
AFT and DOWN.
QUAD 3 is UP and RIGHT.
QUAD 3 is UP and RIGHT.
QUAD 4 is DOWN and RIGHT.
DOWN and RIGHT.
Okay, SYSTEMS B. SYSTEM B QUAD 1 is DOWN and LEFT.
DOWN and LEFT.
QUAD 2 is UP and LEFT.
UP and LEFT.
QUAD 3 is DOWN and AFT.
DOWN and AFT.
And QUAD 4 is UP - UP and FORWARD.
UP, FORWARD.
Just a minute, Dave.
Check the attitude against what we've got there in the book.
Okay, roll?
Hey, it looks like you're off a couple degrees in your roll.
Okay, I'd believe that.
I guess you got to roll right a couple more?
Now roll left.
Roll left?
055. I'm not sure that our ORDEAL is working worth a hoot.
Not on ours; it didn't roll left.
Don't argue with him about which way we're going to roll here.
Okay, but we have an attitude problem then.
That should be right lined up now.
Okay, you agree with me?
What is your roll angle?
180.
Okay, I know what our problem is. It's the docking ring angle and it's - So we should read 2 degrees more than normal. Okay, let's go.
How about that?
Whew, figured it out. 302.36. That's right; that's right.
Okay, we agree then.
Say, Regulus is one of the stars we use for our star check two, isn't it?
It's the third star check on the second alignment.
Right over there by the Moon.
Doggone it, the tape is on. I wonder when I turn that on?
5 minutes on my mark.
MARK.
Okay.
Spider/Gumdrop, Houston. How do you read?
Reading you five-by, Houston.
Roger, Gumdrop. If you've got time now, we'd like for you go ACCEPT so during this busy period we can ship you a state vector. We'll not give you a NAV check; we'll do a vector compare.
Roger. Going to ACCEPT now.
Roger. Thank you.
Houston, this is Spider. We're reading you also, now.
Very good; you're loud and clear. Standing by for your undocking.
Roger.
One minute.
Roger. We're ready.
Ready.
Roger.
10.
5 seconds, UNDOCK.
MARK.
3, 2, 1.
UNDOCK.
Uh-oh. We didn't release.
No, it's hung.
Hang on something.
I'll reinsert and pull backwards.
We have a short pull backwards.
Say again.
I said would you hang on something. I'm going to pull you back a little bit.
Okay.
Okay. We're nice and stable with respect to you.
Okay, we - we're hanging on to the end of the probe, Rusty, and Dave is maneuvering around, and he's getting straight, and we're going to redock.
Okay. We seem to be banging; it seems like the probe's out; the capture latches haven't released.
Yes. That's what it looks like.
We're pretty stable here. Wonder what's wrong with it?
Houston, got any suggestions?
No - You know -
We're copying all that, Gumdrop and Spider. Stand by.
Jim, we probably ought to thrust up when we - oh, no - that's right -
No, we're captured.
We're captured.
We're all right.
Well, if - if all of them are still hanging.
No, we're alright.
we're - we,re solid. You could really feel that yank on it, so -
Okay. You're free.
I'm free?
Roger.
What did you do?
Oh, went back to the old memory and put a cycle on the switch, and you look like you're free.
Okay. Great.
Did you deploy?
Okay, go to MODE CONROL.
Okay. We're going to start you around now.
Okay.
Hold off.
What?
Wait a minute.
I can't hear you.
Hold. Wait a minute till I get clear.
Okay.
Now you're clear.
Okay.
Easy. Hey, you got about 3 degrees per second on that.
Ooops. Okay.
Okay, go again.
Now.
Keep it over there, Jim.
Okay, got it.
Well, I guess we'll see at the end of the rendezvous whether all that's going to work.
Okay. Our attitudes are a little screwed up now Dave, so we may have a little problem with that.
Roger. I noticed.
Okay. I'm stationkeeping on you now, so no sweat.
Okay.
Spider, I'm going to stay in plane and just follow you with the pitch.
Okay. Fine. How am I drifting away from you?
You're drifting out of plane.
Elliptic, out of plane. To your rear.
Okay. Well, I can't notice that. My REG's look good, except my yaw rate is going around about 1 degree per second.
Yes, the flight control system is reasonably stable -
After we get over to the bellyband we could roll.
Yes.
Up - upright first?
Yes, I think so.
Okay.
Are you yawing now?
That's right. I'm yawing right now. I'm doing my 120-degree yaw. When I get over here, Dave, why don't I just stop the yaw and roll - my roll so that I'm up, rightside up, on the bellyband. Then it'll get back to maybe about the right attitude, at least in plane.
Good idea.
Okay. Stand by - stand by.
6 hours. 8
MARK.
Hit it. There.
Shoot, let me just maneuver it over there.
You want it in PULSE to MANEUVER.
Yes, put in PULSE.
You're in PULSE.
This hand controller is really bad news.
Roll PULSE?
No, let me take it over in yaw first.
Okay.
Okay, go to ATTITUDE HOLD.
Okay, you got MODE CONTROL?
Okay. You want roll PULSE?
Yes, give me roll PULSE.
You got it?
Okay, Dave. I'm going to roll up in plane now.
Boy, every time you do that, we get that - oh, I get it. We should get that though. Start getting fluctuations in the manifold - yes - but that's right.
Hey, let's pitch at a little higher rate, Jim, to catch up here.
Well, wait a second. Why don't you just - let's just forego some of the inspection, at least get each other squared away here.
Okay, well, we can see how it works out.
Yes.
Okay, Dave. I'm going to come rightside up here now, and when I get hit there, then I'll just stop and you can position yourself.
Okay.
Okay.
We're not going - we're not going to do the pitch, 180-degree pitch.
We won't do the 180-degree pitch, Dave; we'll just do the 90-degree pitch up here.
Okay. Good idea.
Get over there.
Okay, go to ATTITUDE HOLD
I think it would be all right if we just get some relative attitudes, because I'm going to maneuver to the proper attitude for the SEP, and you can line up on me there.
Right. Okay.
Okay, ready for the pitch?
Right. Okay. Okay. I'm going to do the pitch-around maneuver, and I'm going to pitch 90 degrees only.
Okay. Fine.
Okay. I'm going to start now.
Okay, I'm going to start. Ready.
You're clear.
Okay there. Oh shoot, now. (Laughter) Just by accident - okay, you got - that's the other one's fine. Okay, camera coming out. All set. Boy, that Sun is going to be right in the wrong place for - for these pictures, holy smoke.
It's...
looking good.
Okay.
Jim, I'll be ready to hit the hand controller.
I can get it.
No, that's okay. I'll get it. You got to hit that doggone hand controller so fast there.
I think - let me try - I could - I could do better myself if I knew when - when it was going to get hit.
Okay.
How's he coming?
I don't know; I don't see him yet.
Here he comes.
That's a nice looking machine.
So is yours.
He is over here in the left.
Oh, shoot - no wonder - oh, there he is.
That's about all it looks like, though, is some sort of machine.
You sure you don't want me to get it, Jim?
No, I'll get it.
Okay.
Okay, Dave. When I get about perpendicular to you, I'm going to stop and start my yaw to the left.
Okay.
Okay. I'm going to start my yaw right now.
Okay. Keep...
Okay, - do you want to - okay.
Okay, why don't you get some pictures.
Go ahead.
Okay.
We're not that far behind, Jim. We're - we've got lots of time.
We're supposed to start that in 18 minutes, so we're just about - just about there.
I think we're in good shape, attitude-wise.
Yes. We only got off about 20 or 30 degrees, there, Dave.
Yes.
Try another setting here real quick.
His flashing beacon is working, by the way.
Yes, I saw that.
Okay.
All the downlocks look good so far.
That's very good.
Okay, let me get this off of here.
Oh no, I want to keep it there, that's right.
Woo! Forgot.
On shoot, I think our COAS is crapped up.
Yes, that's a pretty bright background.
Spider and Gumdrop, Houston. Sometime within the next 4 minutes let's get - Be sure your S-band volume is up. We'll be going over to Madrid.
Roger. Spider.
Gumdrop.
Well, I think that - Okay, you can - you can - discuss the thing on the tape here; we got that on.
Okay, the attitude control in - in AGS every bit as bad as it is in the simulator, I think.
CB(11), STAB CONTROL DECA POWER, CLOSED, first, Jim.
Okay. DECA POWER, CLOSE.
Right. Okay, and I got DESCENT ENGINE OVERRIDE, CLOSE.
Okay.
Okay.
Yes, I really think we've lost the God-blessed COAS.
Okay. I've got 13 minutes before the SEP burn.
Okay.
Would you believe it, but I think COAS went out. Oh, there.
Oh no, there it is over there. Okay.
Okay.
You got it against the right stop, Jim?
What?
Is it okay?
You have it against the right stop?
Yes.
Okay.
93, 00, 00 - 0093, ENTER; plus 00000, ENTER; 09300, ENTER - Oops! Try it again; VERB 25, NOUN 84, ENTER.
I'm getting a look at your engine down here, and it looks pretty clean.
Good.
I can't see much except your nose, so - Right now, I can't even see that.
Okay, how close are - we're still a little ways away.
Boy, if you ever got out against that sunlight that, we'd have it.
30 degrees of yaw remain. We want to go GUIDANCE CONTROL to PGNS.
PGNS now. Oh yes, oh yes.
you got -
Let me get a picture of that. Oh boy, that's pretty. I'll get the whole thing with you in the foreground sort of.
Oh, go ahead - let's just take a picture of him, the heck with it.
Hey, I'll call up the VERB 77 -
No, not - okay, just hit the 77. Okay, GUIDANCE CONTROL to PGNS, MODE CON - ATTITUDE CONTROL to MODE CONTROL YAW. Okay. Call on the ENTER.
I can see your skip rudder when I back off just a bit.
Roger.
Okay, and this ought to be in nice style.
Yes.
Okay, 3, 2, 1.
HACK.
It's not bad.
Okay, Dave. We can take over the stationkeeping here.
Okay, hit the VERB 77 ENTER.
Okay.
I've got a slight up movement on you.
Okay.
Okay, GUIDANCE CONTROL to AGS.
You've got the stationkeeping.
I have the stationkeeping.
Stationkeeping. Let's see - let me look at the AGS here. Okay, GUIDANCE CONTROL to AGS. You ready.
Did you say your COAS was out?
No.
It's working; it's so dim I just can't see it.
You ready, Jim?
To AGS - go ahead.
Okay, we are in AGS. Okay, LM in active stationkeeping. VERB 83, ENTER. Okay, and you want to adjust ORDEAL. Okay, he must be over your side.
I got the same.
God-blessed, that ORDEAL isn't working at all, Rusty.
It isn't.
No.
153 degrees.
Well, I don't know if you can set it out of plane.
Yes, I can set it out of plane - set it out of plane before, at least it stays somewhere near -
Have you got the power on and everything?
Yes.
And Earth rate.
Yes.
Okay, 153.6. Okay, PROCEED. Let me just check that here. What do you want - you want to take a picture of him.
I'm starting to maneuver to SEP attitude at this time.
Okay.
Gee, yes, I'd like to get a picture of him. Oh, shoot. Can you yaw a little bit, Jim.
No, I'm not going to do that. That AGS Control is - just won't work.
Try it in PULSE.
Can you do it in PULSE?
I'm translating over there slowly.
Okay.
Okay, I'll just miss his attitude maneuver.
Did you get the lens cover off? You got the lens cover on, haven't you?
Yes, you do. (Laughter) Great!
Hey, why don't you give me the - this camera.
Okay, here go ahead.
You want me to stationkeep just a bit?
No, we'll just let it run.
Okay.
My window is in the shade here, I don't know how we ever - I guess we didn't really figure the Sun very well for that, did we? We figured the Sun ought -
Okay, 17 minutes - it's 7 minutes...
Did you set any - can you get movies of him now?
No, he's - he's up too high and over too far.
Why don't you unmount the camera and try to hold it.
I can't even see him, Jim.
Okay.
Okay, you ready to go to PGNS?
Yes, I'm ready to go back to PGNS.
Okay, going to PGNS.
Here, why don't you hold on to this?
Okay, tape we're going back -
Why don't you hold this and let me turn it to PGNS - I don't want to not have my hand on the handle.
Okay.
Okay, we're in PGNS - and if you want to comment on the AGS ATTITUDE HOLD there -
Yes - didn't seem to be too bad -
Well, AGS ATTITUDE HOLD if you don't have to - ATTITUDE HOLD is good; it's the RATE COMMAND that's so atrocious.
Okay, Spider/Gumdrop. We're going to lose you here within a minute at Madrid. We'll see you over Carnarvon around 23.
Can you see him at all now?
Just barely. Can you get a little higher, Jim?
Yes, I'll start - I'm moving up that way now. Okay?
Okay, let me have it back now that we've - made this switch.
Okay.
Roger. Gumdrop copy. Carnarvon at 23.
That's affirmative.
Hey, Spider...
I'm just about at the attitude now in...
plane...
and the roll is the...
like your...
attitude...
too.
Okay, you look good to us.
We're drifting over slowly to the right and up, Rusty.
To the left and up?
To - to the left, yes.
Okay. He's coming over our right, and we're going -
And, Gumdrop, your vector is good. We've looked at it; the computer is yours, of course, and you can go BLOCK any time.
Okay, he's coming now.
Okay; thanks, Smokey.
Boy, we're sure not hearing them.
If this COMM doesn't improve, David, we're going to have an awfully quiet rendezvous.
Roger.
Okay, I - Why don't you take the pictures and and -
Yes.
Crew, I have 5 minutes on my mark. 2, 1 -
MARK.
Roger; we're right with you.
Right with you.
Okay.
Are you stationkeeping now?
Well - why don't we just let it drift?
Okay.
It's not going anyplace.
That was my one chance. (Laughter)
You'll get another chance.
No, I won't - where?
Not until we get back.
Okay, looks like we've got just a little bit of roll.
Okay.
Okay, that's enough on the movies, let me go back to business here.
Okay, VERB 84. You have that all loaded?
VERB 84 is all loaded.
Okay.
Okay, when he starts up -
Okay, I'm ready with the VERB 76. Okay, let me take a few - Oh hell, you've got a - You want me to take some more that way? You've got 3 minutes here.
No, I don't want to take any more pictures.
Okay, I'll try to get one here.
There goes a name-plate off of something.
Yes, I see it.
Yes.
Okay, I got to get - I got to get into 76 here, Rusty.
Roger. 76 is right here, and I'm all ready to hit ENTER.
It's all set up.
OFF, damn it; tape OFF, CLOSED.
AOT LAMP BREAKER is CLOSE.
AC BUS B only, right?
AC BUS B; that's right. Okay.
30 seconds. Average g is NOM.
Roger.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
BANG.
Okay, 5 feet per second.
Roger. Looks good. Okay, zero residual.
Roger.
Hey, I'm getting a VERB 80. Okay, you just want to track them on the COAS. Right. AC breaker in place? VERB.
Right.
get the AC breaker in. Did you get a time on?
No, I didn't.
Okay, I'll call you when it's about...
It was about 59 there.
Say again.
It was about -
Okay, we'll make sure.
Okay, Gumdrop. The tracking light's coming on.
Okay.
Yes. Wow! Yes, it sure is.
Yes, right between the eyes.
You know, I don't think I'd been able to track you on my COAS. It's not bright enough.
You can probably get it close, Jim.
Okay.
Okay.
Yes, the camera's off.
I'm standing by with a VERB 41, NOUN 72, as soon as I - get the flashing - Okay, there we go.
Okay, I got the big.
Okay, Gum.
And I'm all ready - to the camera. Okay, stand by. I'll be I second.
Okay.
Okay, you ready?
It's ready.
Okay, here it goes.
And there it is. Stand by. We haven't got the NO TRACK light out yet, but it's blocked off. Okay, the NO TRACK light is out. Hey, we call a VERB 83 ENTER. Okay, it says he's a - 1200 feet.
Okay, the radar is a GO. Wait a minute, that's - that's going to change again.
Okay, Gumdrop,.
Right. Go.
Gumdrop, you're - we're done with the radar check.
Gee, that's pretty good. Fine.
Now we're going to put our EXTERIOR LIGHT to DOCK and get ready for the alignment.
Roger.
Rusty, let me - get this off of here, it's sort of in the way.
Okay. I'm - I'm going to take it - Okay, go ahead.
Okay. We're ready for the maneuver, ready?
Okay, go.
Okay, here goes the maneuver. Gee. Great Scott! Okay, the ERROR needles are coming in, not yet, almost. 3, 2, 1.
MARK.
How's that for a shock?
Oh, my goodness. Wonder what happened?
What?
I saw it coming right on down and then -
Okay, you're - you're clear to MARK on either.
You could see it?
Yes, I could but, it's just, it's disappearing out there - what's...
Is the radar in the way?
I don't know; I can't tell. There, I can see it now.
Maybe it's exit pupil. It may be moving in and out of it.
Okay, you're clear to mark on either. You think you can mark on it now?
I'm clear to mark either?
Yes.
Okay, which way do you want it?
Oh boy, that reticle is terrible, too.
Up, 2, DOWN. Whoooo, stop, to LEFT/RIGHT.
It's not moving.
Hello, Spider; Gumdrop. I've got my alignment, and third star check on two bright stars.
Okay, give me about 2 UP.
2 UP.
And about 2 LEFT. I got a Y - I got an X in there, didn't I? 1 RIGHT.
Yes, you're clear to mark...
1 RIGHT and stop...
1 RIGHT and stop the UP/DOWN.
You're clear to mark Y.
Okay, marking Y.
Okay, you're clear to mark either.
Okay. Well, give me 1 RIGHT.
1 RIGHT.
Clear to mark X. Okay, give me about 2 DOWN.
2 DOWN.
Okay; 1 UP.
1 UP.
Looks like one's going to do it.
Yes.
CLEAR to mark X.
Okay.
CLEAR to mark either.
Give me about 1 UP.
1 UP.
Looks like another 1?
Yes, 1 more UP.
1 more UP.
Okay, we're in the middle of ours, Gumdrop. We'll be right with you.
Okay, about 1 LEFT.
Okay.
CLEAR to mark Y. This is the third set.
I can take five; I'm going to take all five.
Right.
Okay, CLEAR to mark either.
Okay, give me one RIGHT.
1 RIGHT.
How about stopping the UP/DOWN?
Okay, give me about 2 DOWN.
2 DOWN.
That was the fourth set, wasn't it?
Yes.
I'm going to mark X, right?
Right.
1 UP.
1 UP.
Okay, now...
CLEAR to mark either.
1 UP.
1 UP. How about stopping the LEFT/RIGHT?
Yes.
Okay.
Another UP.
Another UP.
Another UP.
Okay, CLEAR to mark Y.
This is almost as hard to use as the simulator.
Is it coming?
It's coming.
Stop the UP/DOWN...
Yes.
That's the last mark. To hell with it.
Okay.
Okay.
See it move back a minute?
Let me look at something just a minute here.
Okay, here comes the Acrux now.
Okay. Ready?
Ready, GO. AUTO MANEUVER. GO.
Yes.
Could you tell that was Sirius?
Yes, it's definitely Sirius.
Gee, you could identify all this - It's not even dark yet. Boy, there's the Gumdrop.
That's Canopus over there.
Okay.
There's a whole mass -
Boy, it looks just like the simulator in the ball. Man, it is coming right down the same way.
to do.
Okay, a... has you within 1 degree.
Roger, great. This AOT is really not a very good optical instrument, I tell you. Hey, there's Acrux. Whoooo, pretty close!
Man, that'll be great.
Okay - okay, you're CLEAR to mark either.
Can you pull that right - right window shade up, Rusty?
Okay, right window shade coming up. Stand by and let me see if I can get that up there. Okay.
Oh, let's turn down some lights. My God, we never even turned off any lights.
Oh.
That help any? Let me get...
Yes, that helps a lot.
Here, let me get up some for you.
Okay, listen. What you've got in there right now is good.
You should have to pitch up a good bit.
Yes, oh yes, pitch up and...
Okay, it's...
Under the right too.
Yes, I got the one at the right end.
Okay, pitching back down. Okay, how's that?
You're too close. 1 more to the RIGHT.
1 more RIGHT.
And just let it drop down.
Okay.
It's going to be in X.
Okay.
Stop the LEFT/RIGHT, or not?
Stop the LEFT/RIGHT.
Yes. Okay.
1 more UP.
Okay.
Oh, we're way over control. And I glad we don't have to do one with an ascent only!
Well, we still need UP RIGHT.
Yes, one more UP.
There - there it goes.
Boy, oh boy, everything is so bright in here.
Okay, CLEAR to mark Y.
Want to turn down your lights before you do that, or not?
If you want to reach over there.
I can't reach them.
I don't want to mess with them, yet.
Okay. CLEAR, to mark Y.
Give me 1 to the RIGHT, LEFT.
Okay. 1 DOWN?
No. Stop - yes, stop to dial -
Okay, yes, right.
I wanted to get down a little bit farther there - You can't get the -
1 more RIGHT.
RIGHT or LEFT.
LEFT, I mean.
Never mind. Just leave it like it is now.
Okay.
Okay, mark either.
Okay, give me a - 1 RIGHT.
1 RIGHT.
1 UP, too.
1 UP, too.
Okay, 1 more RIGHT.
1 more BIGHT.
How you coming?
Okay, just let it go.
Okay. I'd like to kill a roll pulse here.
No, not yet.
Okay.
Okay, now you can.
Okay.
Okay, give me 1 DOWN - What am I marking now?
You're marking X.
Good. Hey, it's harder than hell to get this star focused and the reticle focused, too. They're not even focused in the same spot. You know, you're looking for the exit pupil of one; doesn't seem to be where the exit pupil of the other is.
Okay, CLEAR to mark X.
Okay. 1 UP.
CLEAR to mark either.
1 on UP.
1 on UP.
Another 1 UP.
Another 1 UP.
Boy, this pulse is really nice.
Okay, CLEAR to mark Y.
Okay,...
Gumdrop/Spider, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
1 LEFT.
okay, 1 LEFT.
Which set was that?
Gumdrop. Roger.
That was about the - I think this was the third.
Roger, Gumdrop. Confirm the SEP burn.
Roger. SEP burn on time. Good burn, and everything's looking good.
Thank you.
Okay, mark either; that was the third set.
Take 1 RIGHT.
1 RIGHT.
Stop the UP/DOWN.
No.
And Spider's here.
We finished making Sirius, and we're on the fourth set on Atria.
Okay, now...
Roger, Spider. You are loud and clear.
Okay, now 1 DOWN. And 1 RIGHT, too.
Stop the LEFT/RIGHT?
No.
Okay, that was the fourth set.
Okay, 1 UP.
1 UP. CLEAR to mark either. Can I stop that LEFT/RIGHT, yet?
Yes.
Okay.
You need that one more right now.
Okay.
CLEAR to mark Y.
Okay, just let it go.
Okay.
Let me get one roll pulse here.
No, just - just delay.
Okay.
Okay. Ready?
Ready.
Oh my aching back!
Would you believe five zeros?
Beautiful.
(Laughter)
Roger, Spider.
(Laughter) McDivitt!
Okay, let's do the next one.
Okay.
We're way - okay, stand by here. We've got to get the COAS going. Okay, let me get - copy them down here.
I can see Gumdrop down there.
Okay, 93 is minus 0.090...
That looks mighty pretty, Spider.
minus 0.076...
Thank you.
Plus 0.111. Boy, that docked alignment turned out good, didn't it? Holy smokes! Ready to gyro torque?
Ready, babe.
Okay, there they go.
Okay. PROCEED, ENTER.
Okay, you ready for your COAS?
Go.
Okay, 2's - 526. I want to do VERB 21, ENTER; 526, ENTER. Okay, PRO, VERB 22, ENTER; plus all zeros - that darn.
Regulus should be way over there.
Okay, you ready? Here we go.
No, not Regulus now. This is not Regulus.
That's right; that's the other one.
Spica.
Spica, oh shoot, we're not going to be able to see Spica.
Well, we will when we pass the horizon.
No the Moon's going to be in the way.
Oh.
Spider, Gumdrop. I can see your jets firing just as clear as a bell.
Roger. I was watching your light down there.
Stop right there.
You just gave a big burst, didn't you?
Roger.
Well, there's a star out there, and it's right next to the Moon. And that's where Spica ought to be.
It just lights up the whole sky.
Can - okay, now stand by and let me - zero some things for you.
Here, let me -
Gumdrop, Houston. Did you do a P52 there?
Roger. And stand by, and I'll give you the angles.
Roger
It will be about 5 minutes.
It's right on in yaw, and it's right on in pitch now.
Okay.
Okay, it's a half of a degree out in yaw, right out in pitch.
Okay. PROCEED, PROCEED; PROCEED. Okay, now let me just check my - where I am here. Okay, the time now is 93:27:30. Okay, and - we've got the position of the star - we're there. Okay, we want to do a VERB 34. Okay, VERB 34, ENTER. Okay, and you can to CB(11), AC BUS B, AOT LAMP, OPEN.
It's open. Close.
Okay.
Okay. Come on, baby. Okay, I'm updating and aligning the AGS, and we're 6 minutes up. We've never been here before.
Yes.
5 zeros. McDivitt, you're fantastic!
I'll take that beer.
Yes.
Where are - where are we?
Okay, tape is coming off.
Where - where are we, Rusty?
We're at - no, I'm going to leave the tape on. Excuse me. We're at rendezvous - We're at minus 13 minutes on phasing. We're coming up on phasing 16.
And you're updating the AGS, okay?
Right. 8 feet per second free spectrum, and we're 0.14 - 1.6 miles away.
Right.
Okay, here goes the alignment on the AGS. Nicely. Okay.
Okay. Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston. And I'll lose you at Carnarvon in about a minute; and bring up your S-band volumes about that time. We'll have you at Honeysuckle.
We'll proceed now.
Okay.
Okay, CB (11), AC BUS A, RENDEZVOUS RADAR, CLOSE. You got that?
Gumdrop.
Okay, RENDEZVOUS RADAR CLOSED.
Okay, - that's in...
Okay, that's in 30 seconds.
Okay, shouldn't we make an AUTO maneuver here?
Right.
The VERB 89, ENTER. And you want the Z-axis, so it's a plus 1, and it's a PRO. And there's going to be the roll pitch and yaw. And a PRO. Okay, ready to maneuver?
I'm ready.
Okay. PRO. Boy, it really goes off with a bang, doesn't it?
Yes. Keep an eye on that propellant.
Yes.
Okay, you got the time up, yet?
42 - not quite, yes. It is. So we're missing him.
Oh, that's okay. I wouldn't sweat that one. PRO. Okay, RENDEZVOUS PADAR to SLEW, you want to track the CSM with the COAS, and you are in PULSE. Okay, and you got a roll - 25 degrees to the left.
Yes, let me get up there to them.
Okay, want me to turn some lights down for you?
No, I can see them fine. Surely they got a good light out there. Getting close, anyway.
I don't see it. Where is he?
He's right at - he's right down the Z-axis about a half - No - oh, he just fired a bunch -
Oh, hell, I got my window shade up. No wonder I can't see.
Spider, Gumdrop. I've got you at 1.78 miles and 4.8 feet per second.
Okay.
Are you firing a lot up there?
Yes. I'm just - Yes. Roger.
Yes, just spurts. Yes, look.
That's going to put your light out. I can't even see it.
Just pulsing.
I don't care what it is; it'll put your light out, man!
Okay, we're on him right now.
Okay, you want to lock your RADAR, ON?
Okay. Spider/Gumdrop, Houston. We've got you through Honeysuckle now.
Go to SLEW, don't we, here?
Stand by.
Hey, don't we want to go to SLEW?
Gumdrop monitors. Spider, do you have your light on?
Oh shoot! Yes, now.
On the cab.
Slew it to zero for me will you, Rusty?
And, Spider, when you've got a moment, I want to pass on a little bit of info.
Okay.
Say you want to pass, Houston?
Roger. I want to update your red lines on the DPS: your oxidizer to fuel...
Are you ready?
red line is...
Go.
25 - 25 versus the 12 as shown on your checklist.
Roger. Understand 25 percent on the red line for oxidizer.
No. It's a DELTA-P of 25 psi oxidizer to fuel.
Okay. 25 DELTA-P oxidizer to fuel.
Roger. On the DPS
the line.
That's affirmative.
Okay, we're locked on. Good, solid.
In other words, they are both 25 now.
Roger. Got you.
Okay, let me see where we are, now. Okay, VERB 70, VERB 89, okay. RENDEZVOUS RADAR? Okay, RENDEZVOUS RADAR to AUTO TRACK. Okay. You've got it there. Main load lock ON; you want to verify that.
Houston, Gumdrop. I can give you those angles now.
Go ahead.
Roger. GET at 93:14:00, plus 00117, plus 00035, minus 00109.
I have.
Okay. Here comes a VERB 83.
Plus 00035, minus 00109.
Roger. Copy. Thank you, Gumdrop.
Did you get the landing radar breaker closed too, Jim?
Roger.
No, I didn't.
Okay. You want to get that one?
You know he actually - he puts out his light when he fires this stuff.
Yes, doesn't he? He puts out a whole cloud.
Fantastic.
Hey, you want to adjust the ORDEAL here.
353. Right on the money.
Yes, it's doing all right now.
Okay. You don't want to adjust it?
No, it's all right.
Okay. We've got about 8 feet per second and 2.225...
Why - why don't you leave it there until I get right side up...
Let's see how we score on that.
Okay. That's a little bit off now.
Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston. You GO for phasing.
Roger, Houston. Understand we are GO for phasing.
Gumdrop copies.
Okay, we're going to have a few updates, Jim; it looks like we've got a little bit different here.
Okay.
And, Gumdrop, you might anticipate a MASTER ALARM on your H2 tank pressure.
Okay. When we are going to P20?
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger.
No, we are not going into P20 now, Jim; we're...
No, yes, no. Not when I was really - I was just acknowledging the fact that - when we go there, we're going to get a...
Yes. Okay.
Probably an update.
Okay. We're going to bypass the maneuver.
Boy, I wish I had some rate needles I could use.
Enter on that - Okay. We've got 12 minutes until the burn, and we're up to about - Hell, we're about 12 minutes. What do you know!
Okay.
All of a sudden we're back on the time line.
Okay. NOUN 86, ENTER. Okay. Let me copy those down. Plus 1.2, minus all zips, and minus 90.7 - Okay, but I'm going to use the pad anyway. Okay. I'll do a KEY RELEASE.
Spider, Gumdrop.
Go ahead.
May I have this cross in link?
Okay.
Man.
When your thrusters fire, it just puts out a great big orange cloud I can see way back here.
Yes. Yours too.
Okay. Now I need that pad, okay, I got it.
Looks like somehow or other, we're out of plane, too.
Boy, I sure could use those 1 degree-per-second rate needles, or at least some rate needles that were accurate.
Yes.
We are alright there.
Gumdrop, did you ever pick up my light again?
Spider and Gumdrop. We are going to lose you at Honeysuckle in - within a minute, and we'll see you over the Mercury at 43.
Roger.
Roger.
Okay.
Gumdrop, cut your lights down.
I've got your light.
Okay.
I have it showing about a degree or so out of plane, already.
That's not too surprising.
What?
At this close range, Jim, that's not a surprise, I guess.
Well, I really didn't expect it. It surprises me.
Yes, I do too.
Okay, at 10 minutes to go: Okay.
Did you get to VERB 78, ENTER?
I have us about 7 minutes late on the crossing, and I don't know why.
You gave us what?
About 7 minutes late for the horizontal crossing.
Oh, really?
Yes. I don't understand it, Rusty.
Gee, we're just about crossed right now. We're look - we're going to be looking up at you, I think, here, if I pitched all the way around.
No, I don't mean that.
Oh, my ORDEAL slewed good.
Boy, we're right on 286 in the pitch, Jim.
Okay.
Okay. Did - did you get VERB 78 in?
I'll get it when I do...
No, I better wait until you clear the.
I got it. VERB 78, ENTER. Okay.
Okay.
Okay. Let me see where we are now. Okay. We got the cumulative DFI POWER, ON.
DFI POWER, ON.
PRPLNT QUANTITY MONITOR, DESCENT 1 and 2.
PRPLNT QUANTITY, DESCENT 1; DESCENT 2.
Standing by for 6 minutes. Okay. Here we go: if no DPS ignition, or premature shutdown, do not restart. Okay. Okay, it says, "Null only Y and D residuals.
Okay.
If the X residual is less than 20 feet per second, perform insertion as planned. If the X residuals are greater than 20 feet per second, eventually do not - do NCC NSR.
Okay.
Okay. Do not stage. Terminate burn, if the attitudes are greater than 10 degrees, attitude errors greater than 10 degrees, rates greater than 5 degress per second, 3 second overburn or equivalent.
Okay. Do you know the burn time on this? We don't even have it.
No, we don't ever have a burn time.
Okay. Standing by for 6 minutes. So let me just check all the RCS and everything.
Okay. What do we do here? We slip throttle profile. It's all...
And throttle up to 40 at 5 seconds.
To 40 percent. We'll just stay there.
Okay. Okay. That's 25. Okay. Do we have a DELTA-P of 25 in the DPS between oxidizer and fuel.
Now, whoa, whoa, tight.
Okay. We're looking like about...
Its 12.
12, yes. Okay. So we're...
We got ULL limit, wasn't it?
(Laughter) Yes. As a matter of fact, OX HIGH, too. I guess that's why they gave it to us.
Okay. In 6 minutes, we're going to do the inverters. Then we're going to go to PULSE, and you're going to gun control the AGS, and fly the AGS errors to zero.
McDivitt, I can't believe that alignment.
(Laughter) Neigher can I. Don't tell anybody though.
Gee.
There's the one spot on this floor I need a hunk of Velcro I don't have one.
Okay. 407 seems to be holding right now, for some reason.
Okay. All right, let's start this thing a little early the first time through it here.
Okay. EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSED.
INVERTER 1, CLOSED.
Okay. I'm going to INVERTER 1. Okay. We're on INVERTER 1.
Okay, we didn't glitch anything. Cross tie balance loads coming OPEN. But let me tell you what your BUS does. It dropped to 29 - 29.4.
What's - what's the other one.
Just a little above that; 30 something.
That's okay.
Okay?
Yes.
Okay, we got that done. ATTITUDE CONTROL to PULSE; MODE CONTROL to AUTO.
MODE CONTROL to AUTO.
Okay, GUIDANCE CONTROL to AGS.
GUIDANCE CONTROL to AGS.
Fly the AGS nearest to zero.
Oops! Hold on.
Come on.
Okay, flying to zero.
Woop. Remember, you're not going to be pointing that at them when you do that.
Yes, I realize that.
Okay.
I haven't been anyway. Let's see, when I get there, I can just put these things to MODE CONTROL, and yaw looks like it's in pretty good...
Well, you don't really want to...
But you don't want to do that too early, here.
No. It'll eat up an awful lot of fuel. That PULSE isn't too bad, because you can feel it; you know it?
Yes.
It turns out it works all right.
Okay, stand by for the 4 minute check. The two clocks are right together.
Okay.
Okay, PGNS says, they're pegged at 5, that's right.
Get up there faster. Okay, we're already to zero range rate.
Yes.
Where are we? We're 16000 up, no 14.
Dave, it looks like we're having horizontal crossing right about now.
Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston through the Mercury. Standing by for your burn.
Standing by for your burn.
Oh, no we're not. No, he's not on our Z axis, Jim.
Roger. Stand by.
Yes, but the range rate is going to zero. We're not up.
And I'm reading you.
Yes.
Roger, Houston. This is Spider. How do you read?
I'm reading you loud and clear, Spider.
Okay. 4-minute check. ENGINE GIMBAL, OFF.
ENGINE GIMBAL, OFF.
ATTITUDE CONTROL 3 to MODE CONTROL.
Roger. I'm right with you on horizontal crossing.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, you want to call them?
No, let me get them in there.
Okay. Looks good, come on roll.
Okay, hustle up there. We got a lot to do here.
Okay, get going with the checklist.
Okay, TTCA, THROTTLE, UP, and MINIMUM throttle. THRUST CONTROL TO MANUAL.
THROTTLE, UP, MINIMUM; THRUST CONTROL to MANUAL.
Okay, MANUAL THROTTLE to COMMANDER.
MANUAL THROTTLE to COMMANDER.
Verify MODE CONTROL, AUTO.

Okay, ABORT PRESS, to ON.
ABORT PRESS, to ON. You got your stop -
I got it. Okay, verify DPS and APS, temperatures, and pressures. We got 28 seconds to the 2 minute.
They look good.
Okay. How's that PGNS error look?
4 degrees. SUPERCRIT pressures back up again. Can't be anywhere there except ambient.
Okay, stand by for 2 minutes.
It will be 2 minutes on Mark, Gumdrop.
Okay.
Oh, gees, I got to get my gloves on.
MARK.
Right with you.
Verify burn attitude compare PGNCS and AGS attitude errors. Let's see; PGNCS, okay. AGS and DEADBAND. Okay. Okay.
Okay, in 8 seconds we're going to start ULLAGE.
Okay, why don't you read here, and I'll just...
Okay. We have the 2 minute mark thing done, verified to BURN ATTITUDE.
Wait, I'm still...
Take your AGS, ATTITUDE ERRORS.
I'm still watching 407, too, cause I don't want that damn thing to change.
Okay. So you got all this other stuff up here, yet. Okay, at 8 seconds, you do plus-X ULLAGE.
Right.
At 5 seconds, you hit the ENTER.
At 5 seconds I turn the ENGINE GIMBAL to ENABLE.
Alright.
Okay. 55 I throttle up to 40 percent.
Go ahead.
Okay, ENGINE OFF. I'll go GUIDANCE CONTROL to PGNS; ABORT PRESS to RESET; ENGINE ARM, OFF; TTCA comes up.
Okay, and I'll be copying down the residuals.
Okay, and then you PRO.
and burn the -
and burn the residuals off.
Right.
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and forget about 407, here.
Okay.
35 seconds, Gumdrop.
Roger.
If we get out of control, I'll shut it OFF. Our stop button's uncovered.
Okay. You got to go to ENGINE GIMBAL ENABLE right?
Right.
Okay.
10 seconds.
8 ULLAGE, ON.
Okay.
Okay, and ENTER.
ENGINE GIMBAL, ENABLE.
Okay. Light - there it is.
Okay, ULLAGE, OFF.
Okay.
71 feet per second remaining.
Little rough there.
Yes, wasn't it. I think it swallowed a little helium. Okay, they're both counting down together.
Together, okay.
Okay, ENGINE, OFF.
Shutdown. Okay controls are off.
Okay. 0.9 minus 10 - minus 1.
GUIDANCE CONTROL to PGNS
In PGNS, okay.
ABORT PRESS to RESET. ENGINE ARM, OFF. TTCA COMMAND to JET. Oh, look at that. That's good. It's a good burn, Gumdrop.
It was a good burn, Gumdrop.
Okay. Good.
Got a little rough there when we throttled up.
It got a little rough there when we throttled up.
Gees, it's a hell of a translation.
Well, you didn't have the Gumdrop with you.
Holy Christmas!
Okay.
Look's good.
Okay.
Okay, PROCEED. Stand by here.
Okay, I want to do VERB 79, ENTER. You want do a CAL.
We want to - we want - Yes.
ENTER.
Fixing the CAL coming on.
Houston, the CAL coming on?
Zero zero, ENTER.
Houston, Spider.
ENTER.
Go, Spider, Houston.
Roger. The burn was a good one, and we are giving you CAL.
Roger. Thank you.
At 500, 501, and 502, after trimming the PGNCS, we are reading 00 and minus 1.
Roger. Good work.
Okay, did you get VERB 79 in?
Yes, I did. Landing radar open.
Okay.
Okay. LANDING RADAR, 0PEN.
RATE ERR MONITOR to RENDEZVOUS RADAR, THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO. PRPLNT QUANTITY MONITOR, OFF. Okay.
Okay.
Okay. Engine gimbal to ENABLE.
It's...
ENABLE.
to ENABLE. Stand by.
INVERTER to 2.
Am I?
Everything looks good here. Spider. It was a good burn.
Okay. It was a little rough. It got a little rough and chuggy around 20 percent as I was throttling up. I waited for it and then throttled up...
INVERNER 1, OPEN.
throttle 1 OPEN.
1 OPEN.
You got INVERTER2, ON?
Check.
Okay, INVERTER 1 coming OPEN.
Roger. We're losing you at the Mercury, and we will see you over Texas about 05.
Okay. And you can debrief the burn.
Okay. Got it?
Yes.
Okay.
Okay, as I was - we had a nice slow start again, just like we had previously. However, as I started throttling the thing up, I got up to about 15 or 20 percent, and I started chugging. You could actually feel the rough combustion of the - behind the spacecraft. I held the throttle there, and, I might add, I throttled up quite slowly. I held the throttle there, waited for it to catch up; it did, and I throttled on up to 40 percent, and it followed itself going up.
You want to pitch -
now and...
Yes.
to pitch now on the I'm going to.
Okay.
Okay.
Are we in 76 now?
See, I - I'm going to -
Here.
Here, very good.
See how bad off we are; we're pretty bad. The shutdown was good. The residuals were practically zero, and Gumdrop is way down below us. There. See him?
Get that one.
Yes. See him?
Yes.
Hey, I'm surprised we didn't break LOCK.
He's practically underneath us.
Hey, we really got to pitch pretty fast on that.
Yes.
Wonder what it looks like from over there?
Your broadcast begins.
Thank you. Hey, keep after us, will you, Davey?
Okay.
Boy, are you down below us!
Let me make sure I still have him, Rusty. I'm not -
Yes, right.
No sweat, 28 000 feet, it's 6 miles, 2.7 and we got a good radar.
Quiet.
Yes.
Hey, are we still locked down in the pitch part -
Okay, we're pit - locked on in yaw, too.
Okay, it's good, huh?
Yes, good. Okay.
Ready for LGC?
Oh, yes, LGC. Okay, watch this thing.
Okay.
Okay, I know what that was. That was, that thing was not on LGC. I didn't read the LGC first to you.
Yes.
5.15 - let me just verify it.
That's a verify.
Boy, that old petrol's really gone down.
Okay, now it goes - Okay. Okay, 5.25; 3 degree alarm.
Yes.
No sweat. 3.27.
Okay, let's take it.
Okay.
Gee, there's some funny rates there.
Hmm! What's that? Well, I thought I could get into the - Let me get the TPI zero time here going. Okay, it's 94:57.
Is the tape off?
Tape coming.
Hey, Spider; Gumdrop. I've had about three marks and it's starting to go away.
Okay, we're getting 3 degree here, but they're starting to come in.
Gumdrop, for your info, I can still see you out at 12 miles.
Roger; and I can still see you.
Good.
Matter of fact, you're just a great big bright star in there. In the sextant,. Ooh, I can still see your.
Is that right?
Right.
Gumdrop, Houston through Texas. Standing by.
Spider/Gumdrop, Houston through Texas. Standing by.
Hello, there, Houston through Texas standing by. How are you?
Oh, we're doing fine. Looks like you are doing great up there, also.
Okay. Where are we over the ground?
Oh, you're just coming into Central America down here.
Okay.
I'll tell you one thing, this is really an ungainly beast with that big descent stage on it. With the - when you try to thrust laterally.
Roger. Copy.
Gumdrop, Houston. Like to verify H2 tank 1 heater is AUTO.
That is verified H2 tank 1 heater is AUTO, and I have the cryo light on.
Understand.
But the fuel cell light is off.
Gumdrop, Houston. We'd like to have H2 tank 2 heater to AUTO.
H2 tank 2 heater AUTO, now.
Understand.
Hey, Gumdrop. We'll be having our first solution here in a few seconds.
Okay, I've already got mine, and I've got an elevation of 211.49.
Hey, Dave. We're plotting our relative position to you, and, man, we're right on the nominal.
Hey, that's great!
We got it at 26 miles right now, if you are interested.
And we got 30.59 for our first elevation angle solution.
What did you get for yours, Dave?
Well, in your language it would be 31.49.
Oh, I didn't hear - I heard - I thought you said 2114...
Wait a minute, 21149.
Okay. Fine.
Right now, I have you at 26,27 and 150.4.
Okay. I've got 26.27, and I'm at 155.5. That's on my radar. It's probably 5 feet off. Matter of fact, it didn't agree with the tape's record by a couple of feet per second.
Gumdrop, Houston.
This is Gumdrop. Go.
Roger. We noticed you're gone to a four-jet roll authority. Unless you're got a good reason, we are recommending Baker Dog roll OFF.
Roger. I'm running the DAP.
And you can check the DAP. I'm using DAP
Roger, Gumdrop. Copy
There's the BD roll OFF.
Copy.
Spider, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Spider.
Roger. We would like to have the DFI OFF at this time, and we would like to have you verify the CO2 sensor circuit breaker on panel 16 is IN
Stand by.
Roger. It's closed.
Roger. Understand it's closed. And if you're got a minute, I want to give you an update on some bias times.
Okay. Houston, Spider. Be with you in just a second.
Roger. No sweat.
Do you want to watch your radar now? Is it staying the same.
Go.
No, I didn't need it.
Okay. Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. This is an update in your P32 program. The TPI bias has changed from 3 minutes to 4 minutes. We want you to add 4 minutes on the TPI bias in your CSI P32 program.
Roger. The CDH bias still 1 plus 45.
That is affirmative. The CDH bias is 1 plus 45. We are only changing the TPI bias.
Roger.
Gumdrop, did you get that?
Roger. I copied.
Good time for procedure changes, isn't it?
Roger.
Spider? Spider, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. I - As you've probably figured out, this is due to the change in the orbit. We've got a little more eccentricity than we planned on.
And we are showing your orbit as 122 by 127.
Okay.
Spider/Gumdrop, Houston. I have a TPI0 PAD.
Spider ready.
Gumdrop's ready.
Roger. Reading TPI0: 094 57 5300, minus 202, plus 004, minus 015 203 N slash A N slash A 3090, minus 1511, aft l68, right 003, up 113. End of update.
Okay. This is Spider. I missed the first digit in the aft.
Roger. Reading aft: l68.
NOUN 42.
And NOUN 42 - I have no data - N slash A here.
Roger, Spider. I got the whole thing. You want to read something back?
I don't know if Houston is reading me or not.
I'm reading you. Spider. Go ahead with the readback.
Okay. What's the last digit in the NOUN 42?
Okay. Are you asking for the last - Say again what column it is, Rusty.
Roger. The last digit in NOUN 42, DELTA-V.
Roger. DELTA-V is 203.
Roger. And what is aft component, please?
Roger. The aft component is l68.
Readback: 94 57 5300, minus 202, plus 004, minus 015 203 NA NA 3090, minus 1511, aft 168, right 003, up 113.
That is affirmative, Spider. Houston confirms the update.
And Gumdrop copies.
Roger, Gumdrop.
Dave, this is Spider here.
No solution on that one.
What do you need?
Nothing. I just wanted to tell you we got another solution on an elevation angle of 25.05.
Okay. I've got another one with elevation angle of 27.26.
Okay.
Beautiful.
Let's stick together.
I'm with you.
Spider and Gumdrop, you are GO to go beyond TPI0.
Roger. Spider here. Understand we're GO past TPI0
Gumdrop copies.
Roger. Roger.
Recorder on. And I'll tell you what; why don't you pitch up just a tad, and I'll get another mark here.
It is coming right on down now.
Okay.
Hello, tape recorder. This is the old CDR here. I've got a couple of comments about the spacecraft. The COAS has to be made brighter; it's just absolutely unusable the way it is now. I - I really have great skepticism about whether I'm even going to be able to dock this afternoon with it or not. I think that we really got to work to get something better than that. Also, I think that the restraints here pull you toward the front of the spacecraft too much, and you're continually pushing back. I think we could sure fix those up a little bit, although that - they are not nearly as aggravating as the COAS. The window shades are in the way all the time. And when I did the - when I use the AOT, I find that the - the reticle and the stars don't seem to be focused at the same place. Come on radar, don't screw up. Another red light flashing a little bit.
Ohhh.
Okay, 49 miles,...
Okay, I guess those - those are the only comments I have right now. Oh, the spacecraft seems to be very ungainly when you're translating left to right, fore and aft, with the descent stage on it. MODE CONTROL, using PULSE, either PGNS or AGS, is very nice. We have awfully fine control, very good. The rate needles are absolutely atrocious. It's almost like flying without rate needles, and they ought to be - I'm sure that you could probably put a new set of rate needles in there for 0.1 of what it costs in fuel to oscillate back and forth. I think that's all I have for right now.
Hey, by the way, I can still see in the daytime here.
Can you really?
Yes.
Let's see, he should be right out there in front of us, shouldn't he? Let me find him again.
Hey, so can I again.
Yes, he's like a star out there.
Yes.
Okay, and what's the range now? It's 49 miles, now.
49 miles.
Okay, so that's pretty good.
Hey, Dave, we are 49 miles, and we can still see you.
Hey, that's pretty good.
Okay.
Spider/Gumdrop. Do you want our guesstimate at your point of closest approach?
Roger. We'd like that.
Roger. It will be 2.7 and the time is 95 plus 17.
Roger. 95 17.
That's affirmative. And I'll be losing you here shortly off Canaries, and we'll see you over Carnarvon at 57.
Roger.
Gumdrop.
Okay, the tape is ON, and Gumdrop, we're turning off our tracking light.
Okay.
Okay, you got the AOT lamp closed; okay, VERB 37, ENTER; 52 - Oh, you've got to turn it up brighter than that, Jim - ENTER; VERB 22, ENTER; 3, ENTER; PRO; ENTER; VERB 21, ENTER; 215, ENTER; PRO.
Ready, go.
Go.
Could you get that light up over my head off there, Rusty?
Yes, I'm going to turn that off, then I'm going to turn that off. Then I'm going to turn that off. How's that?
That's okay.
Here he comes.
3, 2, 1 -

Isn't that amazing?
Here he comes. 3, 2, 1 -
Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by. And I have an insertion PAD whenever you are ready to copy.
MARK.
Hang on.
Yes, let it damp a little bit because we...
Roger. Gumdrop will be about 20 seconds.
Roger. No problem. This is a 7-minute pass, and we will have Honeysuckle shortly thereafter.
Roger.
Okay, go. Give me about two UP, three UP, maybe.
Three UP, you've got them.
Right.
And, one to the RIGHT...
And Houston.
Spider is reading you. We are in the middle of our alignment.
One to the RIGHT.
Okay.
Couple more UP.
Roger, Spider. Copy.
this is the Gumdrop, Stu.
Gumdrop is ready any time.
Roger. I would like to hold it, Gumdrop. Spider is in the middle of their alignment.
Roger. I'll wait for them. I'm ready whenever they are.
Okay.
Very good.
Stu, I'd like.
In the meantime, I can give you gyro torqueing angles if you like.
How about some more RIGHT?
MARK.
Okay. You cut me off by a few seconds; that was my next question. Go.
Okay, one - one more UP.
Okay. GET 94:57:00, plus 00083, plus 00008, minus 00034.

Okay.
MARK Y.
Roger, Gumdrop. Houston copies.
Gumdrop.
Want another?
No; you can stop the UP/DOWN though.
One DOWN.
That's good.
it's going to be faster if we do two, and then take one out.
Oh, Hell!
What is the matter?
I marked an X when I should have marked a Y.
Give me - Wait a minute, now. We've got a program alarm. Okay. You are CLEAR to mark either now.
Oh, shoot! Okay, I screwed the whole thing up, didn't I?
Yes. Okay, give me one UP.
One UP.
Stop the LEFT/RIGHT.
Okay, it is stopped.
Okay, give me about one LEFT.
One LEFT.
Did you give me two; that was probably alright.
No, I gave you one ROLL. I'm rolling when I think you are not marking, but keep that at zero.
Okay. CLEAR to mark Y. CLEAR to mark either.
Okay.
Give me one RIGHT.
One RIGHT.
CLEAR to mark X.
Okay.
Just let her drift, right?
Just let her drift, that's right.
Okay.
One up. And one RIGHT, too.
Left, I've got it.
Well, I wanted it RIGHT, but that...
You wanted it RIGHT?
Stand by, just leave it - I don't want it where it is right now. Just let - let it go and let me see where it is going.
Okay.
One LEFT or RIGHT. Never mind, Just leave it go. Okay. One UP.
One UP. CLEAR to mark either.
Okay.
Okay, CLEAR to mark Y.
Okay, one - Just a minute. One RIGHT.

Okay.
Oh boy, terrible.
Screwed up. Screwed it up!
Okay, torquing angle - Did you get - We're going to do a third star check on this -
Right.
Plus 00089, plus 00055, plus 00037.
And, Spider, this is Houston. I copy the angle.
Roger - Roger.
Roger. Spider.
Roger. Looks like things are going well.
Ready.
Roger. And you might bring up your S-band volume. We'll be going over the Honeysuckle in about 2 minutes.
Gumdrop.
Roger.
this is the Spider.
Make sure we don't get in gimbal lock there.
Here he comes. Bang, right there.
Two miles, Houston.
Stand by; I'm - I'll zero it for you. It's zero right now. close. Wait a minute; stand by. Boy! You know, you get some slosh in there - Okay, now it is coming back in. It is a little to the RIGHT in yaw.
Okay. Spider ready to copy the update.
Yes.
Okay, and about one UP also. Okay, it's crossing right now.
That's good!
Okay. PRO, PRO, VERB 34, ENTER, the CB(11) AO BUS, OPEN, the lamp, OPEN, and a tape coming off and the time is 95:03:55.
MARK.
Okay. We're going to hand off to Honeysuckle. Let's - We'll have about a 30-secong breakout, and then we'll pick you back up again.
We'll be standing by.
Spider/Gumdrop, Houston through Honeysuckle. How do you read?
Okay, Spider/Gumdrop. I believe I've got you through Honeysuckle, if you are ready to copy.
Okay. Spider ready to copy.
Gumdrop, are you with me?
Gumdrop - He's on S-band.
Okay.
How do you read, Gumdrop?
He doesn't have you latched up yet, Houston.
Okay. I'll give you about another 30 seconds to a minute, and I'll read it.
Okay.
Hello, Spider. Houston with your insertion PAD. And, Gumdrop, if you can read.
Gumdrop, are you reading Houston yet?
Hey, Rusty, I am going ahead and give it to you.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. Reading insertion: 095 39 0700, plus 00431 all zips, plus 00008 00431 000 104, plus 00431 all zips, plus 00012. End of update
Roger, Readback - and, Gumdrop, you might get this. 095 39 0700, plus 00431 all zips, plus 00008 00431 all zips 104, plus 00431 all zips, plus 00012.
Okay, Spider. Your readback is correct. Gumdrop, did you copy?
Gumdrop, did you copy?
Hey, Dave, did you read Jim?
Gumdrop, do you read Spider?
Spider, Gumdrop. We will probably lose you here at Honeysuckle in about a minute, and we will see you over the Mercury at 17.
Roger, Houston. This is Spider. Gumdrop, do you read that?
Okay. Gumdrop, be advised we can hear you transmitting, but your voice doesn't come through.
And, Gumdrop, if you got the PAD, how about just giving a blip-blip on your microphone there?
Gumdrop, how do you read Spider?
Reading you loud and clear, Dave. We really lost track of you before. Were you reading us at all?
I was reading you, but I wasn't reading Houston. I missed the insertion PAD.
Okay. We copied. I'll have Rusty give it to you.
This is GET insertion in six parts. Okay?
Okay. We're going to - We're waiting to do a VERB BD again.
You're hot.
With a minus 8.
Spider/Gumdrop, we have you through the Mercury. You should be right at your point of closest approach, 1.9.
Houston, how do you read Spider?
Spider, I read you loud and clear. Did you copy my last transmission?
All I heard you say was we were at the point of closest approach, that was all. What else did you have to say?
That was it. And 1.9 miles. Gumdrop, do you read Houston?
Roger, Houston. I read you five-by.
And you are five-square, Gumdrop.
Okay. I never got a lockup over the Honeysuckle.
Roger.
Houston, Spider here. Our closest approach was 16 000 feet on the radar.
Roger. Copy. As you went over the hill at Honeysuckle I heard you reading the PAD to Gumdrop. You got it, didn't you, Dave?
Roger. All squared away. Thank you.
Roger.
And, Houston, this is Spider. Did you get our torqueing angles on that last alignment?
That is affirmative. We copied them.
Okay. Fine.
Looks like things are going well.
Yes.
And, Gumdrop, let us know when you want the track align back.
Okay. Stand by.
Houston, Spider. When are we going to get the GO for insertion?
Roger. You ought to have it within the next minute or two. We're looking - taking a look at the data. Everything's looking real good.
Okay. Fine. How are we doing on the RCS RED LINE?
You're real good. The LM is right on the predicted plot, and Gumdrop is in good shape.
Okay.
And, Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston. You are GO for insertion.
Spider.
Gumdrop.
Okay, Spider. You can put your light back on. Thanks.
Roger. ON.
Okay.
Okay.
Spider, this is Houston. After insertion, we would like to leave the DFI on for approximately 5 minutes. We'll give you a call when to turn it off.
Okay.
Spider/Gumdrop. About 30 seconds LOS Mercury. We may see you over Redstone around 31; if not, Guaymas at 35.
Okay.
Gumdrop.
Spider/Gumdrop, Houston. We have you through the Redstone. Standing by.
Right.
This LM DAP is really a nice flight control system, Houston.
Roger. Copy, Spider.
The tape is on OFF. Okay, CB(11) EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSE.
INVERTER 1 coming CLOSE; it's CLOSED.
Okay, stand by. Going to INVERTER 1. Okay, that's good. CROSS TIE BALANCE LOADS coming OPEN. And, heck, your BUS didn't even drop at all that time.
Okay.
Descent BATS are taking some of the load now.
Yes.
Okay. Standing by for 4 minutes.
Okay.
Let me - let's check the ascent O2 and H2 - O2 and H2O. Good rates. Okay.
Oh! Got a long pad up there. Remind me that that's a 4-minute bias. I want to wri -
Oh, boy.
I want to write it on there...
Yes.
as soon as I...
Oh, yes.
get out of here. Oh, my back.
Okay, let's start the 4-minute check.
TTCA, THROTTLE UP, then MIN THROTTLE.
THROTTLE UP; THROTTLE MIN.
Okay, THRUST CONTROL, MANUAL.
THRUST CONTROL, MANUAL.
MANUAL THROTTLE to Commander.

Verify DPS and RCS temperatures and pressures. Okay, do we have a Delta-T greater than - or a Delta-P greater than A? 15.
Oh.
Oh.
About 15; we're still about the same, then -
Spider/Gumdrop. We got good solid lock; good data. Standing by.
Spider.
Gumdrop.
Okay, standing by for 2 minutes.
Hope we're pointing in the right direction. How about that?
Gumdrop, on ay Mark it'll be 3 minutes.
Okay.
MARK.
Right with you.
Okay.
That thing isn't even firing a PULSE! There it goes.
(Laughter) Yes, that's what it did as soon as I said it wasn't, too.
It's not going to be that way on the ascent stage!
I'm afraid you are right.
Okay, 2 minutes. DFI POWER, ON.
DFI POWER, ON.
Okay, verify the burn attitude.
Okay. That looks good.
Yes. Looks great.
7 degrees; okay that's just about right. Okay.
Okay, at 9 seconds we are...
We have PGNCS and AGS attitude errors?
Yes, we did that.
We're at 104 degrees; that's just right.
At 9 seconds you are going to begin ullage?
Right.
In 5 seconds you are going to press the engine ON?
Right.
Highly efficient burn. How long is it suppose to be? 43 ft/sec, huh?
Right.
Okay. Our engine OFF. I am going to turn the engine OFF. ENGINE ARM OFF, I mean. Come ON with JETS. You'll PRO at the residuals and burn out the residuals.
Right.
One minute.
MARK.
Roger. Right with you, and ready to support.
Okay.
Okay, AVERAGE g's ON. CLEAR, 500 read. Okay. 20 seconds. Begin the ullage at 9.
Twenty seconds.
Roger.
Ullage at 9.
This is going to a lot nicer ullage.
I hope so.
Okay. Ullage ON. PRO. Okay, go, baby. Descent quantity?
Okay.
Don't sweat that one.
Okay. Starting.
Okay.
Okay, then we're okay.
Right.
Burning. They are both counting down together.
Boy, it doesn't trim worth a hoot in hell, does it?
No!
Okay, 2, 1 -
ENGINE CUTOFF.
Okay, get the ENGIHEARM OFF.
Shutdown.
You're on.
It's a good burn, Dave.
Very good. Thank you.
Okay, here's the residuals: minus 0.9, minus 0.2, and minus 0.3.
Okay. That looks good.
Aw, come on.
That's good, Rusty.
Okay.
Okay, stand by here. Okay. R&D TELEMETRY, CAL; and DFI power, OFF; and I'll get the VERB 79. ENTER.
Houston, I'll give you R and D telemetry CAL now, and you can call me on the DFI power when you want it.
Roger, Spider. We'll do that. We copied your burn; looked great. And saw your trimming.
Roger. Going to CAL now.
Okay. You got it in P00? Let's get the P00.
And, Spider/Gumdrop. Whenever you are ready I have your CSI PAD.
Yes. The landing radar breaker, OPEN. Alright -
That was power just to landing radar breaker?
Gumdrop. Stand by.
What's it doing all the thinking about? Did you punch up P00 in -
Yes, it's going into P00.
Why this flashing 37?
Because I had to KEY RELEASE.
Okay.
Okay. THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO.
THROTTLE CONTROL, AUTO.
PRPLNT QUANTITY MONITOR, OFF.
PRPLNT QUANTITY MONITOR, OFF.
Okay, I am going back to INVERTER 2.
Okay.
Okay, INVERTER 2 works. INVERTER 1, OPEN.
CAL is OFF.
INVERTER 1, OPEN.
Roger. Copy. CAL is OFF.
BALANCE LOADS, CLOSED.
What?
I got the CROSS TIE BALANCE LOADS, CLOSED.
Okay, PREP for the CSI pad, and don't forget to get that...
Okay, while we are doing that, let me get the VERB 95, ENTER; VERB 37, ENTER; 20, ENTER.
Okay, and we're ready to - P00, come on, baby.
Okay, ready to error-monitor RENDEZVOUS RADAR?
RENDEZVOUS RADAR.
Okay, we start the AUTO maneuver and debrief the burn. Or, you can start the AUTO maneuver while you debrief the burn?
Okay, we are going to maneuver. Didn't go in.
You didn't wait long enough.
Yes. At 61 we should pitch up a little bit. Just about right. Okay, tape, that burn was smooth start.
Gumdrop, Houston. We're still showing all entry batteries on the line.
Roger. I haven't got to it yet. Thank you.
Roger.
Rather erratic steering in pitch, yaw, and roll. Did the residuals out very well. It had some pretty good size errors as it ran along through the - through the burn; but it looked like it got where it wanted to go.
Yes, there was a good bit of jet firing...
Yes.
on the thing.
Smooth shutdown and no adverse comments about it.
How's that?
Okay, we got the VERB 95 in.
Yes.
Hey, that's pretty good.
Don't forget that 4 - don't forget that 4-minute bias thing, now.
Yes, do that right now.
I've got to take care of the left side before I get the right side.
Roger. I didn't know I was rushing you, Dave. I just wanted to remind you.
Okay. I like those reminders.
Roger.
Okay, how does that look?
Well, we are locked on. Let me see if I can see him out there. Let me zero the needles.
Never see him.
How's the signal strength?
Well, it's at 2.5 and that's pretty good. That says we should be 25 miles, and we're at least that far out. Let me -
Okay, by the way, Mr. Tape, for your information...
Gumdrop, Houston. At your convenience, if you want to, before you start your Marks here, just turn on the fan in H2 tank 2.
Okay. VERB 80.
Let's accept him. VERB 80.
For your information, tape, we can't hear the burn at all. I never have been able to hear the engine burn, have you, Jim?
Roger. H2 tank 2 fans ON. Now?
Roger. Thank you.
What?
Thank you.
The engine?
As a matter of fact, that is right. No.
No, not a bit of noise.
It's no - no audio problem at all. That's worth - quite well worth mentioning.
Yes. Absolutely no noise. Okay, tape, you are going to go OFF, and the time is 95:44:15. 2, 1 -
MARK.
Tape OFF.
Spider, Gumdrop. P20 has you right down the barrel.
Oh, boy!
I wasn't able to do a visual lockon on you that time, David, but the range, or the signal strength on the radar was well up.
Okay. Good.
Spider, Houston. DFI OFF. And we are watching your DSKY, wondering when you are going to VERB 93 it.
Houston, if you are reading Spider, we would sure appreciate a guess at the CSI.
Spider, this is Houston. Say again, please.
Roger. We would appreciate again the CSI time and also where we are going final crossing over.
Okay, Spider. You are coming in real weak. I have your whole CSI PAD, if you wish it. Your CSI time is 096 16 0300.
Spider is reading; waiting for the whole PAD.
Roger, Spider. How do you read Houston?
Houston, Gumdrop is ready for the whole PAD, too. I believe Spider is reading you. Aren't you, Spider?
Well, I was. I just broke lock on the S-band. I don't know if I'm getting him on VHF or not.
Spider, I'm reading you okay. Can you read me?
Roger. I read you that time, Smokey.
Okay. Going with the CSI PAD: 096 16 0300 097 56 2300, minus 393 all zips 136, minus 392, minus 007; and I want to remind you again of the change in the TPI bias. It is now 4 minutes.
Roger, Smokey. Sorry about that, but you broke up completely there. You are coming in very clear when you come in, but you're just broken. Go ahead and read through real fast now.
Roger. 096 16 0300 097 56 2300, minus 393 all zips 136, minus 392, minus 007; and a reminder that the TPI bias is now 4 minutes.
Roger. Are you still with us, Houston?
That is affirmative, Spider. We've got you now.
Okay, I'll read it back here. You are not coming through too well any more. 096 16 0300 097 56 2300, minus 393 all zips 136, minus 392, minus 007, and 4 minutes on the bias.
That is affirmative, Spider. Your readback is correct. And our COMM will pick up shortly. We will be going to Canaries.
Roger.
Gumdrop copies.
Spider, Houston. We'd like to have descent batteries 1 and 3 off the line.
Houston, are you still reading Spider?
That's affirmative, Spider. We should have you here for about another 8 minutes.
Roger. Did you hear my request on the apsidal crossing? Please.
That is negative, Spider. I did not copy.
Roger. We would like your recommendation on first or second apsidal crossing.
Roger. We copy. Spider. Stand by.
Spider? Spider, Houston.
Go, Houston.
Roger. I'm reading you very weak, but we want the second apsidal crossing.
Understand. Second apsidal crossing.
That's affirm.
And, Spider, this is Houston. Everything looks good for staging.
Roger, Houston. Spider here. Everything looks good on board.
Roger. Copy.
Go ahead.
Spider, Gumdrop.
Go ahead.
I get you 0.4 feet per second out of plane at this time.
Okay. Fine. Thank you.
And, Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston. We have an update to your CSI PAD. It is the DELTA-V component now reading plus 006.
Roger. DELTA-V. Understand plus 006. Is affirmative?
That is affirmative, Spider.
Thank you.
Okay, Spider and Gumdrop. We'll lose you in about a minute and a half off Canary. If you want to talk to me anytime within the next 10 minutes, tell ARIA 5 to go REMOTE.
Okay. We'll do it. Gumdrop.
And we'll see you over Tananarive at 16.
Roger.
Spider. Disregard.
Houston, did you want Spider?
Disregard, Spider.
Okay.
Tape ON.
Okay. We'll PROCEED out of there.
Okay. 82 minus 38.0, zips and minus 24.5.
Okay. Go.
Go.
Okay, 9:39. The clock is about right.
Okay, I missed the 10-minute mark. Let me try to get that. 1, 27. Okay, can you carry on there, please?
Yes. Okay, I don't think we need to mess with that; we are going to burn this one here anyway, here so, if - if it agrees with the ground, why don't we just skip the charts?
Okay, I'll just copy down the number, here.
Yes.
The range was 62.5.
Gumdrop? Gumdrop, Spider here. Our solution is 400. At the same time, we are going to burn our solution.
Fifty seconds. ARIA 5, this is Houston CAP COMM. Go REMOTE.
Okay, I copy your solution is 40.0 at the same time.
That's affirmative. Okay, kid. We're up to RANGE and RANGE RATE. We got to go to P00.
P00 update going in the AGS.
Hello, Spider. This is Houston. Do you read?
Ready?
Go.
Spider, Gumdrop. Did you have anything out of plane?
Well you're faster than I thought you were. Go.
Okay, and the next thing you want to do is set the DAP.
Right.
Let's start some of this reconfiguring over here.
Okay.
Gumdrop, Houston. How do you read?

Great! Verify burn attitude.
Okay. We're coming up on it. 3 minutes to go. Okay, Gumdrop, we're about 3:15 now.
Roger, with you and ready to support.
Okay.
Okay, I don't like that AGS. Yes, I guess it's alright. Yes, it's coming down. Okay, stand by for 2 minutes.
Okay, Rusty, we're at 2 minutes. Verify the burn attitude to clear the PGNS. Okay, now what are we going to do. When we start burning, TTCA, COMMANDER, PLUS-X; then hit the stage fire.
I guess we're going to open the window shade, too.
You want to check to make sure that your things are set up there.
Yes.
Okay, I am going to start the fire, then I'm going to stage. When I think everything's under control, I'm going to say ASCENT INTERCONNECTS.
Okay.
Then we're just going to press on like that. You're going to ASCENT the INTERCONNECTS and the main shutoff valves and all that stuff; get down to 9 feet per second, you're going to - to close them up again. Right?
Right.
Okay.
Stand by for a thump on the feed, too.
Yes, we're not going to be able to watch it.
And as we repressurize or anything, I'm going to continue the PRESS right on with the burn.
Right-o.
Let me see how that's doing now. Okay, it's coming in. Good, there was 2 minutes. Okay.
Okay, it's about a minute and 30 now, Gumdrop.
Getting high, isn't it?
No, it's not. It's doing good.
Oh, wait a second. We're just going into darkness, aren't we?
Yes.
Okay.
Hey, you ready?
Okay, all set. Yes, I got to do them one at a time, here. AVERAGE-G's ON.
Okay, start two little yellow lights.
Okay, thrusting?
Thrusting, staged. Okay, INTERCONNECT.
Okay, coming OPEN.

Go ahead.
We have a good burn. Do you read?
Roger. We have a good burn. How do you read?
Spider, this is Houston. Did you burn?
Okay. The residuals are zero, Gumdrop. The residuals are zero. It was a good burn.
It was a good burn, Gumdrop. It was a good burn.

Okay. Have you heard any transmission from the spacecraft?
That's a negative.
Say again?
PRESS REG's A and B, to CABIN.
Are you locked on?
That's affirmative.
Yes, go ahead. SUIT - next step is SUIT GAS DIVERTER, PUSH to CABIN.
Spider/Gumdrop. Houston through Tananarive.
Got it.
Okay.
Okay, now we got to hustle here.
Yes.
Okay, CSI; VERB 95, ENTER. I got it.
Don't - don't forget to - put the bias in...
VERB 20, ENTER. Right, I will.
Okay, go. I - I'll get it, and get over there. See where he is. Is your tape still on?
Yes, it is. I'm going to take my gloves off.
Okay, there was a pretty-good-sized thump at staging and a cloud of debris out front.
Spider, Gumdrop; you say you've got a good burn and cleaned it up. Is that affirm?
That's affirmative. A good burn..
There you go.
And we cleaned it up.
Gee, I can read you now.
Thank you.
Ready?
Yes, go.
Okay, now we got to do the NOUN 31, ENTER; 9656...
Spider/Gumdrop, Houston. Do you read?
Tananarive M&O, Houston CAP COMM. Go MANUAL key procedure.
Roger.
And, Spider - Spider, this is Houston. How do you read?
Houston, I'm reading you broken. Be advised we had a good burn, and we're staged.
Gumdrop - Gumdrop, this is Houston. How do you read?
Hey, it's 96 6...
He's going to be right in the Moon.
9. 1 plus 45 is going to be...
Hot mike.
Thank you. coming up. Came on. Houston, Spider. How do you read?
A lot of...
Gumdrop, our CDH time is 96:58:14.
96:58:14.
That's affirmative.
We get a lot of signal strength, but he's right out there where I can't see him. The Moon's there. Gumdrop, have you come back around where your light is pointing at us yet?
And, Tananarive M&O, Houston CAP COMM. Let me know of any transmission you hear between the two spacecraft.
Roger.
heater. Okay, that's the one they warned us about.
Roger.
Okay, I don't see you out there, I guess.
I haven't turned it up yet.
Okay, let me...
ATT HOLD.
That signal strength looks good, though. It's a little more responsive on the ascent stage, isn't it?
Yes.
I just can't see out there, Rusty. There's nothing out there but Moon.
Plus 000, line 6.

Plus 00058, ENTER...
Let's - let's attempt it.
plus 01400, 965814, ENTER. PRO. You want to take it?
Let's take it, yes.
Okay, VERB 80, ENTER.
We don't really have much choice. He's going to be out there - right by that Moon - all the way in.
Okay, we'll look at the first update and see what happens.
Tananarive M&O, Houston CAP COMM. I think someone there has an open mike.
Houston CAP COMM, Tananarive.
Houston, how do you read Spider? Houston, how do you read Spider? Hey, Gumdrop, if Houston reads you, would you pass them the T - the CDH time of 96:58:14?
Go ahead.
Roger. We heard one transmission from the spacecraft which said, "Go ahead.
Okay. Thank you.
And, Spider. Spider, this is Houston. We'll see you over Carnarvon at 32.
Gumdrop, do you read Spider on this antenna?
Gumdrop, how about this antenna?
Roger. I read you. You read me?
Roger. Did you read the other call I just made?
I heard both of them.
Okay. Looks like I can only receive you on my number 2 antenna, here. Did you pass the CDH time to Houston?
No, I haven't had any contact. Do you have your tracking light on?
Yes, I do.
And I guess you don't see me?
No, I sure don't, Dave. You've got the Moon behind you.
No, I don't see you either.
Gracious. Hope our tracking light didn't fail!
It's not flashing.
It's not?
No. Let's check the breaker.
Okay. Gumdrop, we no longer see the flash off our quad, but now that could have been reflection from the porch. So we - we can't really be sure.
Okay, well, I don't see you.
Roger.
That's encouraging.
Yes, isn't it?
Okay, let me mush on here...
We're - we're going to really be scrambling for a ground solution for this mess.
Yes, you're right. I better get a good chart, here.
Okay, the tape is still on if you want to comment on that staging.
Okay, the staging wasn't too bad. There were some attitude excursions, but not too much.
Okay.
The cloud of debris, none of it very large; and I wasn't able to see the descent stage go away. Not because it wasn't there; just because I was too busy.
Okay, and we're coming up with VERB 32 here, for the first recycle, and I got the VERB 93 in. And I also taped on the interconnect. I can't get over there in this restraint system to use two hands, to do them both at once, so I have to do them one at a time, and that makes it a little bit slower. And then, when I went to shut them off, we got a sticky talkback on that SYSTEM A ASCENT FEED number 2; and it did not go barber pole when I shut it off. So I rapped the panel, and it went barber pole. So that was a bit dicey, too.
Well, I don't see him out there any place.
Okay, tape's going OFF.
Hello, Spider/Gumdrop. Houston through Carnarvon.
How did it go?
Houston, this is Spider. How do you read?
I'm reading you five-square. Spider.
Hey, let me give you the CDH time. It is 96 58 14.
Roger. Copy 96 58 plus 14, and that is a bias time. Affirmative?
Affirmative. That's the actual time we will perform CDH.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, this is Spider. How do you read me?
I'm reading you loud and clear, Jim.
Okay. The staging went okay. We are staged. However, Gumdrop can't find us in his optics any longer, and we may have knocked out our tracking light.
Roger, Spider. Copy.
Before, we could see it flashing out on our quads out here, and I don't see it flashing now, although the flash may have been reflected off something on the descent stage.
Roger. Understand, Spider.
Okay. And, Houston, this is Spider. I forgot what I was going to ask you.
Houston, I know what I want to tell you. That burn we made was 40 feet per second; 40.0, in case you are interested.
Roger, Spider. Could you give me T and DELTA-V?
Roger. The TIG of the burn was the TIG that you passed us on the PAD for CSI and DELTA-V was 0.
Roger, Spider. Thank you very much.
Roger. And our first solution after CDH, we have a 4 second-early TPI.
Copy, Spider.
Houston, Gumdrop is reading but very weak
You are coming loud and clear to me, Gumdrop.
Okay.
And, Spider, this is Houston. The first cut at it, your CDH time looks real good. And could you give me an onboard RCS quantity?
Roger. Onboard RCS is reading 85 and 77.
Roger. 85, 77. Thank you.
Hey, Gumdrop, Spider.
Go.
Roger. Our staging works better than your undocking.
Ah ha. You're one up on me.
Spider, you had better wait until you get back before you start that.
You haven't heard me say anything.
Okay, Spider/Gumdrop. We are about 30 seconds LOS Carnarvon. There will be about a 2-minute break. We will see you over Honeysuckle with your S-band volume up.
Roger.
Gumdrop.
Spider, Gumdrop. How about a range and range rate readings?
Okay. We are at 98.5 miles at 10 feet per second.
Roger. I did. That's pretty good.
Yea. If you can just see me, right?
Oh, about 10 minutes before the burn. About 10 or 12 minutes before the burn.
You can hold off If you want, but I would like your solution as soon as you can give it to me.
Well, don't hold off until.
Oh, don't worry.
Spider, Gumdrop. Seven minutes is a little late. I've got to make a 140-degree maneuver at that time.
Okay, Dave. Go when you have to.
Okay.
Did you get our CDH time?
Roger. I have the time, but I haven't received any PAD yet. Have you?
Negative.
Okay.
They just said that they thought the time looked pretty good.
Okay.
Spider/Gumdrop, Houston. We're working on the PAD. We've got about 4 minutes LOS here. We'll try to have it.
You probably didn't hear him, but he said he's working on it, and they'll probably have it before the LOS in 4 minutes.
Roger. We're not reading him.
Okay. I'll pick it up for you. I might as well do something.
I can have him do a lot of good tracking when it gets daylight.
But that's what we're built for.
Gumdrop, Spider.
Go ahead.
Roger. In case I can't hear him on S-band, you might copy down the whole PAD this time. It's only three more lines past when you normally get.
Okay. I've been doing that all the way, anyway.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger.
Spider/Gumdrop, Houston. We're about a minute from LOS, so we'll try to pick up our PAD over the Huntsville at around 47.
Roger, Houston. Gumdrop copies. PAD over Huntsville at 47, and can you transmit to Gumdrop from.
Gumdrop, transmit to Gumdrop how?
Tape is ON, and it's 96:44:30. Just set the final COMP for CDH. How many marks did we have there?
I don't know.
About 14, or something like that if I...
The number I last looked at was 13.
Yes.
I'm pretty sure.
About 14 marks.
Okay, let's hope that radar stays locked on to Dave. Okay, look at that - 10 miles.
Oh, boy.
Okay.
Did you get that?
Yes. Go. VERB - You want to do the VERB 90. Oh.
Oh, shit.
That's alright. Why don't you do it, and take a look at it right now.
Yes.
VERB 90, ENTER.
What's the time?
Okay, the time is 96:58:14.
58?
58:14.
Yes.
Yes, good. Okay, come on radar. Stay locked.
Sure looks great. It's a big one. Well, that's the way it goes.
What do you want to do? Forget it?
Yes, let's just forget it.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay, 11...
17 marks we had.
17 marks. Okay.
Got that?
Okay, got it. Okay, you may have to get my - Okay, you going to P00?
You're in P00.
Okay, you ready?
Yes. Go.
Transmit the burn data to CSM.
Gumdrop, Spider.
Go.
Okay. Here is the burn: minus 39.2, plus 0.1 and minus 13.7.
Roger. Minus 39.2, plus 0.1, and minus 13.7.
That's Charlie.
Okay.
Spider, this is Houston. Do you read me?
Roger, Houston. Spider copies.
Roger. I just copied your solution. I have one that's pretty close to it, if you'd like to copy a CDH PAD.
Roger. Go.
Go. Gumdrop.
Roger. And Roger, Gumdrop. 096 58 1400, minus 382, minus 009, minus 151 305, minus 381, minus 153. End of update.
Roger. 096 58 1400, minus 382, minus 009, minus 151 305, minus 381, minus 153.
Spider, that is affirmative. Your readback is correct.
Okay, how did we make out?
Good.
Okay.
Okay
Spider, Gumdrop here. I did not copy the update I got the ground PAD did.
I copied you, and were all the signs minus?
That's affirmative.
All the signs were minus.
Okay. I've got the ground PAD now, and I'll monitor it 1 minute late.
Roger.
Okay. Very good.
We're going to do ours, I guess. I haven't had a chance to compare them, Dave, but they sound pretty good.
Okay.
Okay. Go. They - They're within a foot per second or so, even in D.
Do you have all of our solution here, Dave?
Roger. I have minus 39.2, minus...
Oh, hold off.
0.1...
Yes, minus 13.7.
Roger.
Okay, That's plus 0.1.
Okay, plus...
0.1.
Alrighty.
Okay, let's put it up there.
Okay. We're standing for that mark. Signal strength is staying up, so we're probably going to get it.
Yes. I'm going to have to hustle, too.
Yes.
After that - What's after that? You can go ahead and do the AUTO maneuver...
Roger.
and let me get the AGS started here.
call up 42, to do the AUTO maneuver.
Cue me at 7 minutes here, Jim.
Okay, go ahead, I'll - I'll - Matter of fact, I'll get the range rate for you.
Okay, I can't go any further right now anyway.
(Laughter) That don't is it?
Yes.
Okay, you want to read it out for me, and I'll just sit over...
Okay.
here in my corner and plod away.
It's going to be close to 108 or so. Maybe 110.
4, 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
110.
110. Okay, thank you.
Okay. I'm going to call up - Would you align the AGS? - I'm going to call up and do the maneuver now.
Right.
VERB 37, ERTER; 42, ENTER. Okay, it says 306, and I think our number was 305. Okay, we'll do the maneuver. Here we go.
do a pitch up the right way.
says minus 39.5 and minus 14.5.
How about that? Okay, minus - Got that NOUN 86 stuff?
Yes. Okay, you got it? Minus 39.1. All zips and plus - and minus 13.8.
Spider/Gumdrop, we'll see you over the Redstone at about 03.
Roger. Did you get that?
Yes, I got it.
Roger. Gumdrop copies. Redstone, 03.
Okay, I want to get my gloves on first.
Okay. We don't need anything there; we might as well PRO over there.
Okay. Okay, you can mush on here, and...
Okay, it's a 501.
I'm going to get the AGS going here.
MODE CONTROL, AUTO.
Okay, MODE CONTROL, AUTO. We go down to.
HELIUM MONITOR, ASC PRESSURE 1 and 2.
We're at 4 minutes here. Just got there?
SUIT PRESSURE 1 and 2; CB(11), STAB CONTROL, AELD, CLOSE.
And 16. I got mine.
Okay.
EPS, CROSS TIES...
BALANCE LOAD comes OPEN.
Shoot, it's been OPEN. I forgot to close it.
Alrighty.
STOP button's UNCOVER.
Boy, that scared me. That - that ammeter drifts up and - on the bus, and it was up at 100 amps, indicated.
Oh, jeez.
It doesn't read anything worthwhile. Okay, you ready?
Yes.
2 minutes, we want DFI, ON.
Right. 2 minutes, we want DFI, ON.
Okay, what else do we do here except hold our breath?
Yes. 5 seconds. You're going to get the FLASH 99; you're going to put to PROCEED.
Right.
AUTO at 3.5. Then it's going to go kapow, and the burn's going to be over.
Yes.
Let's see, TEMP.
Would you look at that? It's still locked on, or something.
You're right. It is still locked on, so we didn't pitch up very much, at Z.
Yes. We're in the right attitude though, huh?
Yes. 30...
Okay.
305 was the ground-calculated solution, and the PGNS called for 306.89.
Okay.. What, you got your window shade up?
Yes. I'm on the dark.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
Okay, 2 minutes.
Okay, DFI POWER, ON.
Yes. I verified the burn there, too, as best I can.
Okay, that looks good.
Yes.
Okay. I'm just standing by to proceed.
Good.
Okay, Gumdrop, we're at 130.
MARK.
Roger;.
Okay, if we don't get ignition, what do we do?
If we don't get ignition, I'm going to start thrusting. You come on with the ascent interconnects.
Are you going to turn the ENGINE ARM off first?
Yes, I'll do that.
Yes, thank you. (Laughter) I can see us getting all of it, boom, boom.
Roger, Spider. Gumdrop's right with you and ready to support.
Very good.
1 minute.
Tape on?
Tape is on.
Okay.
AVERAGE-G is ON.
Okay.
Get the ullage. There goes the burn. Burn is over.
Okay, 2.4 - minus 2.4, plus 0.8, and plus 1, plus 0.1.
Okay, the residuals are zero.
Well, are we safe? VERB 95 - let's see. Have you gone to P00, yet?
Yes.
Okay.
Okay. Shoot, I'm sorry. I hadn't.
But I looked down there, and I thought I saw the COMP light ON, and then I went back to looking outside here.
Okay, ready for a CAL?
Yes.
BALANCE LOADS is going CLOSE.
Shoot, we just broke lock.
Hmm.
Okay, Houston, that TM CAL coming.
On the rendezvous radar. VERB 95, ENTER; VERB 37, ENTER; 20, ENTER. Okay.
Okay, Houston, CAL's up.
DFI, OFF now?
DFI, OFF. Right.
Okay, DFI's coming off, Houston. Probably nobody there.
Say again.
I said, there's probably nobody there.
Yes.
Hey, here we go. Let's see if it's out there. This is really a good AUTO pilot. You know that?
Yes, it is. It really tracks nicely, doesn't it? Boy, it's right on 0.2 - 2 degrees per second. Oh, that Sun is just right.
Yes, I wonder how we're going to be able to do our docking.
Okay.
Hey, where's 2.2? Come on up there, baby.
There it is. Doggone thing is really working good, isn't it?
Sure is. Look at that. Here.
Okay, that's good, huh?
That's good.
Okay, you can debrief the burn, by the way.
Okay, just a second.
Gumdrop, is that how you them?
You got all your data?
Roger, got it all.
Okay, we along here.
Okay, we're milling along here, locked on you again. Okay, that burn - You feel the ullage come on, and it was a lot more effective with just the ascent stage on.
Sure was.
And then, when the APS came on, it really belts you in the can, by comparison to the DPS. It starts, it stops, and it's all over with before you even know what the heck happened. I thought I saw a big pitch attitude, but I don't know what I saw.
(Laughter) I don't know why. I agree with you. I don't know what the hell is going on.
Okay.
a meteor.
You're on the beam there. I got you.
Well, Buddy, am I glad to hear that!
I am, too. And listen, it's great.
You're about 1 degree from the center of the sextant.
Attaboy. Remember that beer we were talking about the other night? I'll buy you one, Dave.
Roger.
I'll buy you one, babe.
Okay.
Spider/Gumdrop, Houston standing by. How did it go?
Well, it's sort of a kick in the fanny by comparison to the DPS, but it went all right. Good friend over there in the Gumdrop can see me again. I'm off at daylight.
Very good. Understand.
Houston, Gumdrop.
Houston, Gumdrop calling.
Spider, Houston. We are still showing the APS ARMED. Can you verify that?
Oh, gee.
Yes. Thank you very much. Thank you, Houston.
Roger. You're welcome.
Shoot, that's the only thing we had to do on ENGINE ARM, OFF, too.
Okay, I - I still didn't hear much noise on that one. Did you?
No, no.
Very little noise.
I wonder if we ought to pull the A...
Spider, this is Houston. Did you burn the solution that I heard you pass to Gumdrop?
AELD circuit breakers.
I burned the PGNCS solution, which is the one that I passed to Gumdrop.
Very good. Understand you burned it and on the time.
That's affirmative.
Houston, Gumdrop.
Okay, let's start doing some updating into that old ACS here, and see if we can that son of a gun running.
Okay.
Hey, it's really going to be tough to do this, Rusty. This thing's got so much control, I don't know what to do with it.
Yes, I know. Gumdrop, why don't you give me your message, and we'll relay it to them.
I don't know.
Hey...
Gumdrop, why don't you give me your message, and we will relay it to them.
tell them where - were - was and how I but I guess you told them that. That's alright.
You ready?
Okay. Wait just a minute.
Okay, yes we do. Yes.
Oh, I stopped that one there. Come on you. That other one's hanging there, and we have to scrunch down a little low to make it look like it. Oh shoot, it's drifting out.
Now, I don't know, but when it - when we had these things zeroed, the needle was over here on the side. I don't know where to put it.
Okay, I'm just going to put it in the middle. Heck with it. Okay, that's good 75 miles right?
Right.
MARK.
CLEAR 316, plus 00750, ENTER.
I'm going to take my helmet off and get a drink.
And I want to do a VERB 93, ENTER; and a VERB 32, ENTER.
Hey, why don't we pull the AELD circuit breaker?
You don't trust this engine?
Yes, but why do we keep it up?
Because we don't give any more ignition signals or anything, for one thing.
Oh, as a matter, of fact, we're going to leave the tape running here. That's right. So we already got one mark into the radar, I mean into the AGS and.
(Laughter) Hey, look what I had on inside my helmet.
I know. I saw that.
(Laughter)
Boy, it's taking a long while.
There it is - 97:57:...
Push the NOMINAL, quick.
56. Hold on. Okay. 97:57:56. Stand by, I'll check with the - the NOMINAL was 97:56:23.
Okay.
97:56:23, 97:56:23.
Okay, ready for another mark there.
Oh, shoot, I knew you would be.
Man, that sun is really bright.
Yes, you ought to pull up your shade.

There's plus 7, plus 0.3, minus 0.2. Look at that. That's beautiful.
Yes. Hang in there, baby. Another couple of hours. Then I'll have you home.
Okay, that's STOP, RESET, and a down, and there's -
That's close.
And, Gumdrop, Spider. Anytime you want to check your range or range rate, just let us know.
Okay. Stand by.
Let's see, we have the VERB 93 in, don't we?
Yes.
3 marks. Okay, ready for another one?
Ready.
Actually, there's no big rush, but that's okay.
MARK.
Mark. 69 point - or 68.5.
See how it's doing. 114 feet per second. That's not very good. And range is 67.8. That's pretty good, not too bad.
Okay.
It takes a few more before the range rate starts coming in.
Yes.
Let's see how our astronaut one is doing there. That looks good. That looks good.
Ohhhh.
That scared you?
(Laughter)
Houston, Spider.
Go, Spider. This is Houston.
Okay. Onboard RCS 82 and 75.
Roger. Copy. Thank you very much, Spider.
Spider, Gumdrop.
Go ahead, Gumdrop.
I've got 67 miles and 112 feet per second.
Okay. We have 67 miles and 107 feet per second.
How about that.
Now wait a second; you're still 5 feet per second off. You're going to have to shape that up.
Well, let me take some more Marks and I'll get it squared away.
Right.
Okay.
Jees, you just never give up.
We'll - I'm going to get this AGS going here.
(Laughter) See that red light up there (laughter).
Yes.
Hey, that's really a lot that you're doing.
Oh, it's not too bad.
Take my.
(Yawn)
Let's see how our rendezvous radar temperature's doing; it's 95 degrees. You're going to be a whiles ahead. 95 and 97.14.
Oh, I'm plotting these things all wrong. I thought that that was 86. 86 is down here. Okay, we're right on the curve.
Good.
You coming in there, Tiger?
Yes. Tell you what, to hurry up - spend a little fuel now, and save some later.
How you going to save some later?
Well, what I was going to do, is going to take a mark, here, and stop playing horsearound.
Okay, -
MARK.
Mark. 64.2.
Coming in. Good.
Is there anything else we need to do along here?
No. Until we get to 45 miles.
10 marks, we're going to do a recycle. 10 marks, have we done that? No, we haven't done that yet.
Want me to turn that over?
Oh, yes, I guess so.
Soon as that pitch needle dribbles up there we'll be on.
Dribbling slowly.
Shoot, what did it do, stop dribbling?
Sure did.
Just a minute, now.
Hey...
MARK.
Okay. Mark 62.1.
Okay, I think I'll put in a range rate here.
Oops. Let me get over here.
Okay, what is it? 107 and a...
Yes.
Okay.
Okay, 10 marks, and I'll recycle.
Tape, just for your information, the AGS - on occasion here, I clear it when I - when I hit the CLEAR button, I get an OPERATOR ERROR. And I've had to hit CLEAR several times consecutively in order to keep the OPERATOR ERRORS off.
Boy, we really do look coelliptic.
Do we?
Yes, it's been hanging right in 107, you know. Yes, the range rate.
That's the way we like them.
Right.
Nominal is 19.8 and 11.2. Okay, there we are with our time.
97:57:33. So, we're 1 minute late. That's the way to be.
Better late than never, huh?
Yes.
Boy, that Sun is really bright.
Yes.
It's not the Sun, I guess; it's just the Earth.
Gumdrop, Spider. For you information, we've got a TPI time. It's 1 minute late right now.
Okay. I've got a couple of solutions and I've got 98 03 and 98 04.
Roger. 97 57 33.
97 57 33. Okay.
That's pretty stable, boy.
Um. I wonder what they're thinking about in there?
I don't know, but it takes a while, doesn't it?
Yes, it sure does. We may have some trouble getting through that thing for TPI. You notice all this perigee torquing and gyro dynamics that we're getting and - (laughter) You've been steady as a rock all day.
Yes, I sure have.
Did you ever get the AGS all lined up and everything?
Yes, let me set the time again. I've got to take another series here.
And, Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston. I have a ground solution when you are ready to copy.
Spider here. Just a moment.
Gumdrop's ready.
Roger. We're going to have you in contact for about another 12 minutes.
Okay. Spider is here. Ready to copy.
Roger, Spider. Can you take it now, Gumdrop?
Roger. All set. Go ahead.
Roger. Reading TPI: 097 57 4500, plus 196, plus 001, minus 105 223, no roll or pitch, 2670, minus 1010; forward 223 all zips, up 003. End of update.
Roger. Understand. 097 57 4500, plus 196, plus 001, minus 105 223 zips and zips 2670, minus 1010, forward 223 zips, and up 003. And did you count our DSKY on our last recycle?
That is affirmative. Spider. Looks like we're shaping up.
Looks that way.
Gumdrop. Copy.
Roger, Gumdrop.
You and the UP/DOWN component.
(Laughter) Yes. Not, bad, huh? How does - how do the times agree?
Within - 12 seconds off.
12 seconds. That's not bad. I'll take it.
It's the best sim we've run.
Okay, ready for some more AGS stuff.
Okay, good. I'm almost lined up.
Oh, hell. We're going to have to get this one done on the fly. Stand by; stand by; stand by.
MARK.
53.0. Okay.
Spider and Gumdrop, that was our last update. We are going to GO with that PAD.
Spider here. Roger.
Gumdrop. Roger
Hey, Smokey, is Dave Reed smiling?
Well - yes; he's pretty happy, but he's not going to relax until you've finished burning.
He'd...
Better not.
We may need that two-burn solution yet. (laughter)
Gumdrop, Spider.
Go ahead.
Roger. As soon as we get into the dark, give me a look-see. If you don't see any tracking light which I guess you won't - we'll put the docking lights on and you might be able to get a Mark on those.
Okay. Might be able to do that at that range.
Right.
At that range with that big eyeball you've got.
Roger.
Okay?
Hey, with that docking - undocking episode we had...
Ready?
All set.
MARK.
Mark, 50.3.
For that little undocking episode - We're supposed to do a recycle at 16 minutes. I don't know if we want to or not.
No.
Do you want to skip it? I mean at the 17 marks?
No, let's go in a little closer and do one more recycle.
Two? We've only got 14 more minutes, and it takes us 4 minutes to get one.
Yes, okay, let's do it now.
Okay. I'm wondering whether we ought to just maybe forego that - those DTO's.
Yes, that's what I was thinking. I think we ought to get up there and move around a little bit and say, "Okay, let's dock.
Yes.
See what's going to happen. He doesn't have a spotlight.
He doesn't have a spotlight; your COAS doesn't work too well...
I can't - I...
we don't know about that docking probe.
I'll bet you 2 bits that I can't even dock. I bet you he's going to have to end up doing the docking.
And we'll thrust at him.
I want to reset the DAP when we get in here a little closer. Guess maybe I could do that right now. When we're - wait until I finish this recycle, though. Load up and put the A system on align.
Okay, 97 - Oh, look at that, would you?
Where? How far off are we now?
Right there. No, it's up there.
4 seconds.
Matter of fact, I guess this is as good a time to discuss this with Houston as not.
Houston, this is Spider.
Go, Spider. This is Houston, here.
Roger. Concerning the episode we had coming off the probe, and some little VTO's, we have had after we get back up there, I think it might be wise to go ahead and dock when we get there without waiting until almost dark.
Roger, Spider. We copy, and sounds like a pretty good idea.
Why don't you go through those VTO's and see if there is anything that's really important there, and if so we'll try to get it for you, but otherwise I think we might see if that probe is going to work.
Roger. Understand. We've got that in work.
What was it? Just right?
0.3 of a foot per second off there. How about a 415 here?
Okay, stand by 1.
Spider, Gumdrop.
Go ahead. Gumdrop, Spider.
Okay. Mine's conversion now. I've got 9758 on my current solution.
Good show.
Very good; very good. Ours is now within about 3.7 seconds of the ground's.
The last one was 97.
5741, I think.
I've got 97 58 19.
Okay; very good. Sounds like we'll all be together then.
How about that?
Okay, you ready?
No. I got distracted. Okay, stank by.
MARK.
Mark. 45.8.
We can expect getting in another plot pretty soon.
Right, I'm ready for it.
Over Africa, there.
In fact, we can get it right now, if you want to get one pitch up PULSE.
Right there.
MARK.
And that's 45.0, huh?
Right.
That's 12.22.
Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston. We're about a minute or so LOS from Canaries. There is an ARIA, if you need it, up to about 42; we'll see you at Carnarvon at 06, and Dave Reed is smiling now. We might catch you at Tananarive at 49, but we haven't had much luck yet.
Okay.
See our point?
And, Spider, this is Houston. Did you - Did either vehicle read over Tananarive the last pass when we were calling?
Oh boy, I don't remember.
Houston, this is Spider. I don't remember. We've been over so many stations so many times, I couldn't tell you.
Okay. It was at around CSI, right - immediately after your CSI burn.
Roger.
I read you twice, but it was pretty bad.
Yes, we did.
Alright.
We called the...
CDH time...
down to you, too, but didn't get any reply.
Okay. Thank you.
Gumdrop doesn't remember whether he heard you or not.
Okay.
Okay, a couple more of these...
What do you want? You want one of those marks, that's what I'm getting for you.
Yes, another one of these marks.
Oh, you fink head.
MARK.
Mark. 43.2.
Okay, let me get in here with this VERB 48. I'll read that. VERB 48, ENTER; VERB 21, ENTER.
Hey, let me pitch up one PULSE here.
Okay, go. Let's see. Zero, 2 JET A. Zero zero...
We're hold at 42-5.
zero zero, zero zero.
42.5.
I'm rolling. 2 JET A, define ACA, 0.3 of a degree DEADBAND, and 2 degrees per second. Alright. PRO; VERB 34, ENTER.
It getting dark?
No, not really.
Let me open up my simulator window here. I'd like to see part of this rendezvous.
Which part? (Laughter)
The finish.
Wonder if we can see him out there?
Depends on what the temperature of the clouds is. Oh, they're way down.
I can see him, I think.
Look at the landing data -
Say, Davey, I think I see you again!
Oh, very good.
Yes, I do see him.
Okay, we're at 100...
Boy, I'll tell you, you're awful small.
I don't doubt that at all. We're still out at 41 miles.
97:40.
Okay, and, as a matter of fact, you're fading on me.
Okay, we're below the line, Jim.
Are we really?
Yes, on the radar temperature.
Oh, boy...
Now I've got you again. You're going through the horizon, right now.
On the radar.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Where are you going, huh?
Where am I going?
Yes.
Where am I going?
Spider, Gumdrop. Will you have your final solution before, like about a minute?
Yes, are we pitching up - excuse me.
No.
Okay, I'm sorry, I thought we were pitching up. I had looked out the window, and I saw us way up in the air here.
I hope so, Dave.
Okay. Just to remind you that I'd like your time as soon as you get it.
No.
Hey, there he is. By George. Okay, how about another mark here?
Yes, we're going to proceed at 14 minutes, and then we'll give it to you as soon as it comes up, which should be in about a minute or 2.
Okay, thank you.
What kind? A radar for the AGS or radar for the chart?
No, I think we did a chart one last, so we'll do a AGS one here.
Okay.
Okay, stand by.
Okay.
Oh, hell.
MARK.
Mark, 39.5.
Spider, Gumdrop. Will you have your final solution before, like about a minute?
I hope so, Dave.
Okay, just to remind you that I'd like your time as soon as you get it.
Yes, we're going to PROCEED at 14 minutes, and then we'll give it to you as soon as it comes up, which should be in about a minute or two.
Okay, thank you.
Oh, by the way. That time is wrong now.
We're getting on down close to the end, aren't we?
Yes.
Got to start thinking what we are going to do. TPI. That's TPF. KEY RELEASE, 5 minutes. What am I doing over on that page?
Oh, can we get another one for the chart?
Sure.
Okay, stand by.
MARK.
Okay, it's right on the money, 38 miles and 14.4. 38, I said? Yes, 33 and 14.4.
Very good.
Boy, I need to blow my nose.
Oh, me too. I've had a head full. That Actifed sort of helped me at night, though.
Scratch that thing.
Okay...
Okay here.
We've got our last radar warning lights on. Okay, last AGS mark.
Okay, AGS mark, okay?
I mark.
Okay, Spider. I still have you against the Earth background.
Great.
This thing is really tracking.
Do you have a light?
No. It's still daylight to me; you're little black spots; dark on a light background.
Okay, stand by.
MARK.
Mark, 35.8.
Okay.
Okay. We've got about 1425 now.
Okay.
503 minus 00104, ENTER. Okay.
Throw in that one last mark.
Put that on here.
No, on here.
Oh, yes. Oh, okay. Let's get one more on the chart here, since you're close.
Soon as that time comes up, why don't you give ol' Davey a call. There it is, right there.
Okay. Gumdrop, this is Spider. Our time - ready to copy?
Go ahead.
Gumdrop, are you ready?
Roger. Standing by. Go ahead and read it.
Okay. 97:57:79.
Okay; good. My last time vas 97:58:08.
Roger.
That's great.
Where do you stand now?
Ready staying in there. my mode for a 4 for a 304 read. I want it for a plus point.
What are you looking for now? You looking for...
What I'm - I'm looking for - a 40- for a 304 re - I'm looking for a plot point.
Okay. It's 31.9 no - 34 miles - 3.9.
Right there.
MARK.
Hot mike.
Hold. Okay, it's 31.9 - 32 - 34 markup.
33.9, yes.
Hot mike.
All right. Okay?
plus 60.
Okay. We're right on the plot.
Okay.
Alrighty. There we go.
11 7 081 is - Why don't you call in to him?
Seven...
I don't know; 81 and - unless you call into them.
Dave, here are our DELTA-V's.
Good. I'm ready to copy.
Roger. Plus 19.4, plus 0.4, minus 9.7.
Roger. Plus 19.4, plus 0.4, minus 9.7.
Roger. That's correct.
Good.
Good. Do you want to compare now?
Okay, how do they look?
Where are they?
19.4; I got 19.6.
Okay, there they are; 19.4, 19.6.
Hello. Spider. Gumdrop.
Okay, that's great.
Go ahead, Gumdrop.
You got a...
a hot mike, and also my elevation angle on your time is 27.32.
Great.
Okay, I want to set the DET; stop, DOWN.
Okay.
Okay, we can go on to a P00 and update the AGS. PRO. P00.
Okay, I'm - I want to - first I want to get the AGS solution here.
Okay, fine. And we've got an 8-minute mark for you, too, in here. Oops, where the hell did he go? Oh, there he is. I see him.
You got him?
Yes.
Okay, I'm going to be ready in just a second.
Okay, fine. Oh, the Moon is going to be out there.
Okay.
CLEAR 303. Read, 23.46. CLEAR 257. Read -
Dave, just as a matter of interest, the Moon has just come up, and it's going to be shining right on our front face, so maybe you'll be able to track us in the moonlight.
Great!
And I also got.
Can he still see us?
I'll go to docking lights for you at this time, since we don't have a light.
Okay. Here's my answer to your time. 19.4, 0, and 8.8.
Okay, I'm ready for the update.
Great!
You ready?
Ready. Okay, I m ready for the 8-minute mark.
Okay.
Okay, I got the update.
Gee, these marks are going to be a lot more ragged than you've been getting.
100 feet per second, yes - CLEAR 3 - 101 that is.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay, mine was 130.1, Okay?
Yes.
400 plus...
Hey, what happened here?
Huh?
What are we doing?
What?
We just lost - Oh, there we go - Oh, we were doing that. Okay.
I hope not.
That old thing. We just lost the control system there.
Oh, yes.
I keep forgetting that AGS update does that. That was a bad time with me. Okay, we're 20 seconds to go here.
Okay. Damn alignment isn't that good. Okay. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
What have you got there, 29.5 and.
29.5, right - 28.5.
Spider and Gumdrop, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by. I did copy your final solution; sounds great.
Roger. Spider.
That was 28.5, Rusty.
Okay, I got it.
Gumdrop.
Okay, fine. Okay, I'm going to 41 now.
Yes, 20.5.
37 44 -
Spider, Houston. The only one I wasn't sure of was your DELTA-VX. I read it as 197.
I think it was 194; I'll have to check. Just a minute.
19.4, Smokey.
Did you want anything out of here?
NOUN 86, yes. I need a NOUN 86. Okay, and that's plus 19.4, plus 0.4, and minus 9.7. Okay, you can KEY RELEASE on that. Okay. CLEAR, and remind me of the 5-minute mark.
Right. I've got my eye on it.
Shoot, I've lost it again. Can't see with all the lights up so bright.
There's nothing out there I need to look at. Oh, I know, he's going to the other attitude. Getting drowsy. Oh, shoot, we're going to lose lock on him.
I hope not. Call me on that 5 minutes.
Okay, you've got 40 seconds. Yes, he's turned around. We're going to be lucky if we hold lock. It's coming back up now a little.
Shoot, that elevation angle very high.
Okay, 11 seconds.
So you have 5 seconds to go.
4, 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Okay, 26.1 - 26.0 and 99.
Okay, go over to the other side here.
2208, KEY RELEASE.
Oh, let's see. We got that. 5 minutes. I'm going to VERB 77 here.
Okay.
77, ENTER.
Okay, I got a DOWN 1.
Where's the next time we do an ORDEAL update? Maybe I'd better do it here; guess I better. Let's see, VERB 83, ENTER.
Okay, I got a 420 and DOWN 1.
Okay. Going down to the. That's 24, 45.53, 25.9. How does it compare, Rusty?
Compares good, within a foot per second.
Great.
Okay, how much time we got?
2 left.
2 minutes? That's some kind of a world's record.
Okay, let's see what else we have to do here. Copy our angle, verify the burn attitude, compare PGNS and AGS attitude errors. I don't see him out there. I'm sure he's turned around.
Well, the radar sees him.
Yes. 0.05 -
Okay, how's your burn attitude? Boy, look at that; we're even on this.
Yes.
The old REFSMMAT came through, huh?
Oh, yes. We're on over there, aren't we?
Yes. Okay, AVERAGE G's coming ON; I'm monitoring on the AGS here.
Okay, I'm just going to burn it out straight ahead.
Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston. We will see you over Carnarvon at 06.
Roger.
Spider, Gumdrop. Coming up to 133 now, and ready to support.
Okay, I was right with you.
Okay.
call something, huh?
Yes.
Good, I like it that way.
The other DAP's set in now, right?
Right.
Change SYSTEM A. Okay?
Works like a charm...
Boy, and he's right on top of old Scorpio.
I don't see him out there. Oh, yes, I saw him then. Okay, he's right where he's supposed to be.
Yes, the stars are exactly where they were in the simulator.
Yes, the Moon wasn't there, though.
Yes.
Do you know...
the time of this burn, by chance?
No.
AVERAGE g is ON.
Right.
About 10 seconds.
Roger.
Okay.
Thrusting.
Boy, it looks like the 4th of July, doesn't it?
Yes.
Okay, we're getting it in slowly here.
Good.
You ought to be able to see it; it looks like the Fourth of July.
I can. I can see you perfectly.
Okay, we're going to go to P00 as soon as you're done.
Okay, just a second now.
How'd you do?
Looks good.
Okay.
6.
Okay, we had all zips when we went.
Good.
There's two. Okay. Okay, coming to the next side here. Okay, VERB 93, ENTER, right away.
I need a 76, EATS.
ENTER, right away.
VERB 76...
Okay?
ENTER.
Okay, and I'll get that other.
VERB 93, ENTER.
3, right. ENTER....
Okay, VERB 37, ENTER; 20, ENTER. Did we ever break lock?
No.
Hot mike.
Okay, I'm going to bypass the maneuver.
Let's see, we're at 20 miles -
Hot mike.
20 miles.
Thank you.
2 points, so we're all right; makes 5- Yes, I verify he's out there. We can use a.
Okay, you veri - watch - watch in that.
Woo..
Look at that. Line of sight reads what it's supposed to be. Okay, now what we have to do - we have to do a 93 and a 20, bypass the AUTO maneuver, 35 - we've got that up working - set the DET, copy the angle for the charts, at 5 minutes.
Okay. Okay, and I've got - you got 22 FORWARD on that, which is just right, and zero there. Fantastic! The AGS said you did just right.
Good old AGS.
Good old AGS and count DELTA-V pretty good. That may be all it can do, but it can do that.
Okay, you ready for your 5-minute mark?
Yes, do we want to take another plot?
Okay, if you'd like.
Yes, if you're on...
Sounds like a pretty good idea. Okay.
MARK.
Okay, mark, and it was now - what was the...
17 miles.
17. Okay. 17, 32.5. There we go.
Great. Okay, get ready for your mark.
Okay. I'm all ready.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Okay. Right
Okay, and it was 15.9.
Right.
And 107?
Right, yes, 107's mark. Okay, I'll just sit here, and putt along until we get to 7 minutes.
34.73.
Spider, Gumdrop. I'm afraid I just can't see you without that light.
Okay, Dave. We only ask you to do what's humanly possible.
Okay.
You're against an Earth background with a bunch of clouds which doesn't help anything.
Yes, I know it.
Are you all set up for the docking?
All set.
Roger.
Okay, what do you think happened to the probe on the way out, Dave?
I'm not really sure. I think it just got hung up on the capture latches. I took a look to see if it had extended all the way, and the was in the retract position; and, when I went back up to extend the second time, you dropped right off.
I want to get on that thing as soon as possible, just in case something's wrong.
Okay.
I want to get of that.
Roger.
I'm with you.
Okay, are you on, Jim?
Yes, I'm on - right now.
2, 1 -
MARK.
Okay, and that was 14 - 14, and you got to hit a PROCEED here at 7.
I've got the PROCEED,.
14, 37.4. We are right parallel to it.
Just a tad high?
Yes, we're a tad high. I bet we're going to have a zero midcourse.
Okay, Dave. We're calling for our first midcourse.
Okay.
Okay, and we've got you 52 seconds to get through your - do your short stuff.
Okay, and I need my 8-minute mark.
8 seconds. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
That came right at it. Oh.
And it's 12.2 and 98.
Okay, Dave. I've got our DELTA-V's for you.
Go ahead.
X is minus 1.0, Y is 0 - is minus 0.3, and Z is plus 0.9.
Boy, you'd sure argue.
Well, you can't hardly argue with that.
No, I think I'll go ahead and burn them here.
You got that, Rusty?
Yes.
Okay. Did you write them down at all?
Yes.
Okay, fine.
Okay, I get the next ones here. Aft 1.4; left 0.4; and up 1.
0.1.
0.1, yes, I got it. Okay.
Okay, we don't need that. I'm going to leave that,
I'm going to turn up my here...
21, ENTER; 18, ENTER, PRO.
Boy, it reads zero.
What does, your chart?
UP/DOWN, yes. Aft 4 - I'll be with you in a second.
VERB 77, ENTER. Okay, looks like I need them.
Oops! Hey, the chart says you need some aft.
Yes, so does this.
Yes, but it says my - my chart says aft 6.
Oh, goodness.
So...
We're not going to do that...
No.
We're going to do what the PGNS says here. Minus 1.6.
Okay, are you going to okay.
Waiting for the flashing 6085. Should be there right now. There it is; we're going to burn.
Wait a second.
Shoot.
Oops. be careful of the...
Yes, be careful of the bounce.
Okay.
Looks good.
That's good.
Okay. PRO. Let me just make sure...
Okay, midcourse is complete.
we want to go P00 again, right?
Did you finish?
Okay. Midcourse is complete?
Roger.
Yes, let's follow this checklist now just exactly the way it's supposed to go.
Oh, hell, we don't want to go to P00...
We go to VERB 93 and then...
VERB 93, ENTER.
And then ENTER, 37, 35.
35, ENTER. Okay.
Okay, let me just stay here and make sure that first mark got in, and then I want to put VERB 76 in. It's taking something; let's see what it's going to spit out.
Got it, okay?
Fine. VERB 76.
We got a digital jump on our range tape.
Did we?
Yes, we are. We're getting big jumps, about 1000 feet.
Ah ha. That's going to make it interesting.
See it?
Okay, we're about on, if you ought to get something on the - on the big cards.
Right about - how about 56K?
Okay.
How much is it jumping? Oh, that much?
Yes, figuring jumps to about the start...
There we go, 56, 49. Oh, my God.
What are you on it?
Right on it.
Okay, I'll get it; I'll take it. Have you got some cameras we can take a picture of Gumdrop with?
Yes. Can I turn up the lights? Is he bright enough?
Yes, I'm - listen, I'm not even looking at him.
Okay, good.
Did we get the 93 in there? Yes, we did.
Yes, we did. Yes.
Ohhhh.
We're standing by on the 17.
Come on now, don't be stubborn. Right in there; there you go.
Be careful you don't punch that through the window. That would ruin the whole day.
Yes.
Spider/Gumdrop, Houston, We're about one minute LOS Carnarvon. We'll see you over the Huntsville in about 8 minutes.
Okay, Houston. What have you decided about that post - or after I get up there? Should I go ahead and dock or not?
Okay, Jim. We're looking through here and there are a couple of things we really would like to have and that's some pictures taken of the ascent engine area, and we would like to get the rendezvous radar corona test.
Okay. Depends on when I break out of sunlight, what I can do for you.
Okay; very good.
And I'm going to go into darkness; wondering how we're going to get the probe fixed.
Okay; we understand. And have you talked this over with Dave? We haven't heard his comments on the probe.
Dave, can you hear him?
Yes, he copied. Okay.
Roger, Houston. You copy Gumdrop?
Okay. Okay, 56; that was 44 and 564.
We've got Gumdrop here, but I'm going to lose you in just a few seconds. We'd like to have your comments on the probe, too, over Huntsville up here.
Okay, and be ready to give me a GO for the PYRO ARM there too, please.
Okay; very good.
Okay, we're right on it.
Okay.
Okay, and I'm standing by for a 17-minute mark.
Right, we've got a minute 50 to go to that.
Right, okay, and I got the camera out, and it checked out. Okay, let me verify the settings on it, though.
Where's that corona test.
Okay, I did that.
Who does the - who does the jet firing on this corona test?
We do.
Okay, it's running.
Okay. Okay, 1 minute to the mark.
Get back over here.
10 seconds.
Okay, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
17 minutes. Okay, that was - what - and 61 and what the heck was that? 35?
That's 35, yes.
35.
Okay, now we're standing by for...
30, 63.3.
19 minutes, we do a PRO.
Yes, we - we may need just a tad up. We've dropped a hair below the line.
Okay.
But just a hair. And I'll take one at - 18:30. We'll take another mark, and see...
radar there.
what that looks like. Say again.
Oh, that's kind of ricocheting around up there.
What's that?
The line-of-sight rate, that's all.
Oh, yes. Well, they're steadier right now, as a matter of fact, than they should be, according to what Grumman was saying. They had some - a couple of characteristic oscillations...
Yes.
on them that aren't showing up. Okay, 18:30. Can you give me a mark here?
I can.
Okay, great. What was that, 30...
30 000...
30 000 and 68.7. Okay, we're still right below the line.
Okay. Maybe zero. Okay, you got a PRO coming up?
Okay, Dave, we're trying for our second midcourse.
Okay.
Hey, you see his thrusters firing again?
Yes. Okay, when do we get your next one? At 20, isn't it?
Yes at 20. 30 seconds, okay. I got that.
Okay.
Want my DELTA-V for my next midcourse, Dave? Gumdrop?
Yes, go ahead.
Okay, plus 0.2, minus 0.9, minus 1.8.
Here, we got 10 seconds to get this thing.
Got it.
Okay.
Got them.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Okay, that's 4 - 49. What was that, 20 - 25 4 and 49...
49 feet per second. Okay, did you get that stuff?
Just I minute - 73.37. Okay, and that's FORWARD 1.8, LEFT 0.9 and nothing. Okay, go.
Okay. What...
talk about nominal.
We're - bypass the AUTO maneuver. Okay, I'm going to leave this program.
Okay.
I'm going to go to 41; I'm going to ENTER that; and I'm going to go past that; and I'm going to PROCEED past that. While I'm on that, do a VERB -
There's a nothing UP/DOWN again.
Yes. Okay, so ENTER. We're just sort of putting in what we took out last time.
not going to call...
I got a FORWARD 1.
Okay.
Which is close to what the PNGS says.
This shows a foot out of plane, a foot per second out of plane.
Yes.
Okay; about 15 seconds ago, Dave.
Roger.
Okay, thrusting.
Hey, Rusty.
Okay, there are big bounces here, by the way.
Yes. Okay, that's good. Okay.
Okay, they're essentially zero.
Okay we will.
P00.
Okay.
What kind of range rate do you have?
I have 18 700. Right now, it's 42 feet per second.
All right. I've got 3.0 miles at 43 feet per second.
Okay.
What's your pitch angle?
It's about 86 degrees - something like that.
Okay.
Okay, let me look ahead here and see if I can figure out what's going on. Here, let me call the VERB 62 for you. Okay?
Okay.
40 feet per second, right on the money. Did you get the 90 yet?
You can let -
No, not the 90 yet. We're just a tad off nominal. The - the last time...
Did you get the 90 yet?
You're on 90 if you pitch UP there.
the ORB RATE ball isn't right.
Yes.
Dave, do you want to get some pictures of the ascent engine area?
Roger. I got that. Thanks.
Hey, he's in sunlight.
Okay.
Oh, I see you out there coming in the sunlight.
Great.
You're the biggest, friendliest, funniest looking spider I've ever seen.
Do you want...
Do you want the DAP where it is?
Yes, I do.
Okay. Let me look ahead to this corona test here.
And, Spider/Gumdrop, Houston. We are copying you through the Huntsville - next five minutes.
Okay.
And let me know when you want P47, Jim.
And, Gumdrop, in regards to your last request, we have no TM here at the Huntsville in regards to that PYRO ARM.
Roger. Understand.
Houston, Gumdrop.
Go, Gumdrop. Houston.
Roger. We've got a bird here. The only thing I could think of on that probe is that my fingers slipped off of the switch before it got all the way out. Other than that I just can't think of a thing.
Roger. That's about the only thing we can come up here with - that you didn't hold the switch long enough, Dave. I guess - How do you feel about it? You think it's anything - any problem?
No, I really don't. I went back to see if they...
had gone...
a way out to retract, and I had the barber poles which said they had extended all the way. Then I went up to extend again and it dropped right off.
Roger, Gumdrop. Copy.
Jim.
Yes.
It looks to me as - if we just move right on through this, we're going to do the whole damned thing anyway.
Okay.
As long as we stay in-plane on the ball, we just do the VERB 49 maneuver, do pitch up 90 degrees, let him take the pictures. We can set up the rendezvous radar while he's taking the picture, and pitch right back down again. And that does the corona test.
Okay, fine.
Okay.
tell me when you want...
the P47.
You can bring it up now. Hey, let me get VERB 77 in there first.
Okay.
Dave, I think what we'll do is come on up and stop out front there and pitch over so you can look at our ascent engine, then pitch back around.
And then we'll start the docking.
Okay.
Okay, if you want to follow me through this one I'll - I'll just call out the DSKY calls for you.
I agree. We ought to get on with it.
Yes.
Yes.
What kind of range do you have now?
I have 9800 feet and a range rate of 32-1/2 feet per second.
Thank you.
I have just a little bit of line-of-sight rate up.
Roger.
I have just about 9000 feet and 33.
Okay.
Okay, I'll let you know as soon as it comes up, Jim.
Okay, because I'm going to start tossing them out here pretty soon.
Okay. It's probably just about 10 more seconds. Okay, there it is.
Okay. Okay, I'm on my line-of-sight rate, Dave.
Okay, I'll turn on my line-of-sight rate now, Dave.
Okay.
A little more up. Oh, you can see it there.
Yes.
Okay, I'm going to call the VERB 62 here. Okay.
Shoot, we're going to go through the first braking gate without braking, too.
Yes, beautiful. Okay, I'm going to get my Hasselblad ready. 11 at a 25Oth.
Okay.
Once again you're going to get the good pictures on your side.
That's right; that's right.
Okay. I'll tell you what, you want to do that while he stationkeeps, and I'll just set up the DAP and go...
Okay. Oh, gees, what was that! - What in was that...
on that corona test.
We just threw a great big hunk of junk out of our thrusters, there.
Really, this isn't the time to be messing with that kind of thing. Boy, look at that stuff coming out from around him when he fires his thrusters; it's amazing!
Okay. I just went to 6000 feet at 30 feet per second.
Okay.
Okay, I think I'm going to turn the camera on. How much more time we got - 32.5 minutes at 4 -
What have we got, the wide angle - You won't see a thing here, Rusty.
Okay. We copy you. Right on the breaking schedule, Spider. And we'll wee you over Hawaii in about 3 minutes.
Wow, you're right. This one did too. I'm going to take a picture of the thruster out there.
Okay, he's coming now. Okay, Dave, I can see the shape of the spacecraft now for the first time.
Okay, Dave. I can see...
the shape of the spacecraft now for the first time.
Good.
Okay, 6 frames a second. Okay, here it goes.
Okay, tape, if you're running, I'm at - still at 30 feet per second, at 3500 feet. Hey, we look closer than that, don't we? Okay, Dave, I'm at 3000 feet; I'm braking down 20 feet per second.
Okay, Dave, I'm at 3000 feet; I'm braking down at 20 feet per second.
Okay.
Boy, look at all that stuff, would you.
24, 23, 21, 20.
Okay, we're 20 feet per second now at 2400 feet.
Alright.
I got a little line-of-sight rate.
Yes, me too.
Okay, I'm coming up on 1500 feet; I'm braking down to 10 per second.
Okay.
Okay. There we are - We're at 10 feet per second at 1500 feet.
Boy, are you bright, Dave. I'm not sure I'm going to be able to see to dock with this COAS I have.
Just a little up. Beauty! This is running just like the simulator.
Yes, isn't it. I just hope the docking goes like it.
Let's hope it doesn't. (Laughter) As I recall, the simulator didn't work well.
See, that clock isn't doing anything any more is it?
No, it's just counting up from...
Okay, why don't we use 30 minutes - I want to know how much daylight I have left here.
Okay.
Okay. I'm at 950 feet, 10 feet per second.
Okay. Sounds pretty good.
Spider/Gumdrop, we've got you through Hawaii now good and solid, and I copied your last transmission; sounds great.
Roger.
Thank you.
Takes a little longer to take that DELTA...
Your thrusters are little yellow dots.
Yes. They're really throwing a lot of stuff off.
Okay. We're 5 feet per second, about 610 feet.
Okay.
But you are upside down, again.
Yes. I was just thinking one of us isn't right-side up.
Boy, you've got contraptions hanging out all over.
Hold this just a second.
That's show biz.
Alrighty.
Wind - are you going to wind it?
Okay.
Okay. I have us about 370 feet.
Okay. Looks closer than that.
Doesn't it, though?
Okay. Got your camera out so you can take a picture of my bottom half?
Roger. Why don't you come all the way in and stop and then pitch over?
Yes, that's what we're doing. We come on in and stop, and then you're going to take over stationkeeping and I'll pitch around.
Okay.
Give me a Mark next time you turn your thrusters on.
Okay, 3, 2, 1.
MARK.
Thank you.
Hey, you're going up a bit, yes?
How does that sports car handle, Jim?
Pretty nice.
Okay, Davey. It says 100 feet on the radar tape. It looks a little closer to that to me, but what do you say we stop here?
Okay. That's a good idea.
Okay. I'll get a STOP and STABILIZE and then give it to you.
Okay. That looks pretty good to me.
Okay, here you go.
Okay, good.
Let me take a couple of pictures of your nose; then I'll start, pitching around.
Okay, I'll set up this stuff here.
All right.
Okay. You tell me while I guide it, okay?
Okay, babes. You've got it now.
Alrighty; I've got it.
Okay...
Go - go ahead - I - I got a lot of work to do here.
Okay.
Come on P00. Get in there, damn it.
I don't even see you in there, David.
Oh, I'm here.
Which side is he on - he's on - he's on your side.
Yes.
I've been waiting for you to bring that good water back.
Okay, Dave. We're going to start up on AUTO MANEUVER here, and we're going to pitch up; then you can take a picture of our bottom.
Okay, here we go.
Alrighty.
Here we go. 2 degrees per second.
Okay, half-degree per second.
That's a little better.
Oh, shoot OPS.
OPS. Okay, we're going to start the pitch here at 355 and 90...
Are we going to do an AUTO maneuver?
is - yes. VERB 49, it's going to be...
Wait a second...
00 and 85. Okay, VERB 49, ENTER; VERB 25 ENTER; plus 0 - plus 00 - oops, CLEAR. Plus 085 00, ENTER; plus 0000 ENTER 12 - Okay, you ready.
Okay, let me - let me talk to him. Okay, Dave, we're going to start on AUTO maneuver here, and we're going to pitch up. And then you can take a picture of our bottom.
Alrighty.
Okay, here we go, 2 degrees per second.
No, it's a half.
Okay, half a degree per second.
Okay. Okay, now let's start getting the rendezvous radar ready.
Okay, what do I have to do with this?
Oh hell, we can't do that until the damn - That's another extended verb. Okay, let's - let's put it in SLEW and break lock by going up.
Okay.
Shoot, it's going to stay locked on no matter what you do, I think.
Yes.
Okay.
Upside down a little bit at.
It's quietened down a little bit if it looks funny.
I'm - We're looking at you.
Yes, I'm - I wasn't looking at you.
Okay, if we get up here, I'm going to - We're going to finish up the AUTO maneuver and change the DAP to 2012 and set up the rendezvous radar, but I don't know how the hell we're going to get it to designate down there, because if it won't break lock - It's going to be difficult to - to get the job done.
Well, let's see, what do we have to do here?
Okay, like I said, as soon as we get up there...
Looks like a big black hole where an engine used to fire.
Okay. Get a picture of it, I guess.
We're at TPF 18 where we're going to...
I've got a couple. Why don't you just keep going the way you're going?
Okay.
You've got another 20 degrees to go.
What we have to do - All we have to do is put the shaft and trunnion someplace?
Yes, at 0 and 300. Why don't you try to break on that thing after we get up here while I reload the DAP here. We ought to be able to slew the thing up and get it out of there. God, he's putting out so much signal, we don't know what to do.
Yes.
Okay, there we are. We're in hold. Okay, VERB 48, ENTER; VERB 21, ENTER; 2012...
Okay. I can see injectors. As a matter of fact, I can even see the chamber right now.
Okay, fine. Let's take another picture there, and we're going to maneuver back around.
This one is going to be faster.
Okay. This will be 2 degrees per second.
Okay 41, NOUN 72, ENTER. Let's try it.
Okay. Go ahead; I've got the pictures.
Let's punch it in there, designate, then if it doesn't go, the heck with it.
Plus 30000. Okay.
How fast you going to do this one?
2 degrees a second.
ENTER; looks lilke it - PRO. VERB 16, NOUN 72, ENTER. It's not going, okay?
Okay.
Okay, the heck with it.
Hell with it?
Yes, the hell with it.
Standby, let me see what I want to do with this. VERB 44, ENTER. Okay, now I want to go VERB 49 and pitch right back down there again.
Yes.
VERB 49, ENTER; okay, VERB 22, ENTER; plus all zips. No, I want to do that one to go plus 35500.
Say a Mark before you start, will you?
Okay.
PRO; okay, want to tell him 3, 2, 1, MARK?
355, you know.
Okay - get this - Why don't you put the - the signal strength on there anyway.
The transmitter power?
The transmitter power, yes.
Okay, we're going to start.
I'll maneuver now, Dave. You ready?
Go.
3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Okay, the deadband is going to go out first and that is going to. Okay, the signal strength is 2.7.
Houston, for your information we could never get the radar to unlock, so we couldn't.
We want to see if it changes there...
Roger. Understand. The rendezvous radar stayed locked.
Roger.
Shoot, it's not changing at all.
No. It's not firing either.
Okay, well, wait until it thrusts - when the thrusters fire is when we are liable to have it happen. Like right now.
No - no change at all? Still 2.7.
Okay, let's get out of here.
PGNS RENDEZVOUS RADAR, OPEN.
PGNS RENDEZVOUS RADAR, OPEN. RENDEZVOUS RADAR, OPEN.
Okay, you got both of those. Okay, VERB 44, ENTER. Okay, that's done. PRO. Okay, now what DAP for the docking?
I want 00002.
Okay, VERB 48, ENTER; VERB 21,...
You did get VERB 21.
VERB 21, ENTER;...
Okay. I guess the next order of business is to get set up.
2, ENTER...
Roger. Get set up and let's get on with the docking.
PRO; PRO. Go. Okay, that's narrow deadband.
Okay. Do you want to stationkeep on me?
I've got it.
You've got it.
Hey, why don't you stationkeep for a minute -
okay? Don't worry about fuel.
Gumdrop, Houston. We're standing by for your logic and PYRO ARM.
Roger, Houston. Thank you. Logic on my Mark: 3, 2, whoops! Stand by. Okay, 3, 2, 1.
MARK.
Roger. Copy.
PYRO ARM.
And, Gumdrop, Houston. You are GO for PYRO ARM.
Roger. Understand. GO for PYRO ARM. Pyros arming now.
Oh shoot. Would you believe it's not even on now?
You got the overhead?
Yes. looked like it gave you the Earth. Oh, there it is.
Oh, there it is. Holy Christmas.
Okay. Houston, this is Gumdrop here. I've got the full-extend/retract switch in RETRACT. I've got two barber poles. Should have a couple of grey, I believe.
Oh shoot.
Roger, Gumdrop. We copy.
I wonder what that means?
That means we may not get back on it. Okay, I got it again.
Okay, you got it?
When did they go on barber pole, Dave?
Well, when I checked them for full extension before, they were barber pole.
And then when I went back and pushed it to EXTEND, again, to get you off, they went gray, dropped off.
Then they say they're barber pole now, huh?
Roger. Maybe that's right, huh?
Okay. Now, I went - now, I cycled again out to EXTEND and now back to RCTRACT, and I've got two grey.
Okay.
So I think we're all right now.
Yes. Let's get on with it and see if we really are.
Okay Do you want to try AUTOMATIC RETRACT?
Let's try ATOMATIC RETRACT just like we talked about it.
Okay.
Why don't you do your roll? When you do that, then I'm - How's the Sun? Would you be able to dock on top of me if I can't see you?
I'm in good shape sunwise.
Okay. Fine.
Maybe we ought to not try AUTOMATIC RETRACT, because what if I - There's something sort of worrying me. If I hit the RETRACT now, it might go.
Okay; fine. That's a good idea - excellent idea. Let's leave it where it is, and when I punch in you pull me in.
Spider, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Would you verify your DAP load prior to this docking?
Roger. The DAP's four balls 2.
Okay. Thank you very much.
Okay, and I'm going to go VERB 76, ENTER - ENTER when you tell me to go to FREE.
Right.
Houston, Gumdrop.
Go, Gumdrop.
I think we're okay on the probe now. Do you concur?
Roger. It sounds like it's okay now, Dave. Yes, we concur.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, Spider, I'll do stationkeeping when you turn around.
Why don't you do your roll first. Dave?
Alrighty. Here we go.
So that I can get that - that...
window over on the other side
Rolling left 60.
Roger.
Shoot, let me get that camera back. Where the hell's the camera?
It's in here. Why don't you turn the movie camera on?
That's all used.
It's all used?
Yes.
There's a good - pictures now.
Boy, they sure are.
Sun's out the window now, too.
Can't get that God damn thing off of there - Sure is - Oh boy, we're going to come over the Earth.
Yes, we waited too long.
You ever going to be able to see that COAS?
Okay. I'm holding now, 60-degree left roll. Could you stand by 1 second while I turn the docking light on for you?
Sure.
I don't even know where the docking light is to look for it.
I think he means the docking target.
Oh, yes, maybe he does. There it is; it's on.
Yes.
Okay. I've got it, Dave - very faintly.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. Now all set. Tighten that band and the whole works.
Okay, Dave. Now you stationkeep and I'm going to pitch over.
Okay.
Okay, yon want to go to -
attitude hold for one thing.
Down 10 degrees, so you've got to go to 265. I can tell you when have gone exactly 90.
Okay, fine.
Damn it, come on. Shoot.
Hey, you've still got the target.
Good.
Oh, the hell with it. I'll slip it down here. Okay, you've got 15 degrees to go. Okay, you got 5 degrees to go. You've rolled a bit; you right there. Yes, 1 more degree. Okay, that's good on the yaw...
And the drogue.
Right there looks pretty good.
Okay. You've got it?
Looking better, huh?
and a roll right.
Not yet.
Okay.
Okay, a couple more degrees there and about another 2 degrees at pitch.
Okay. I can't see my COAS against you right now; let me get up closer.
All right. Okay. You've got the stationkeeping, right?
Here let me get this window shade up for you.
I've got it.
All right.
Okay, I got the window shade up for you. Shoot, I don't even know where that - Oh, there it is.
Oh, I mangled my helmet, so I can't even use it. Oh!
I've got to look through the top of my helmet. Am I beaded up?
You've got to come back quite a ways, to your rear.
Okay.
Easy does it.
Whoops! Too far.
Yes, I know.
Okay, let me -
It looks like a sporty little machine.
Man.
It's not even going in the right direction.
Hey, I think it's the ATTITUDE HOLD. Jim,...
Yes.
that's kind of faking you. We know we're about 5 or 10 feet out.
Yes.
We're probably going to get a heater light here.
Yes.
Well, don't let that bother you.
Houston, Gumdrop. What time is sunset?
It's 99:15, Gumdrop.
Okay, we got...
Okay. We got about 25 minutes.
24 minutes.
how many.
That's affirmative.
I just can't even see the COAS, Dave. I don't know exactly where you are with respect to it.
Okay. You want me to do it?
No. Let me work my way in here a little closer.
Okay.
Okay, that attitude's just right.
I can't even see it.
You may have to actually get her right on the target before you can see it, being right next to it.
Yes.
I can't see it. There it is, way over there now.
How's it controlling?
It's okay. I haven't done any attitude control yet.
No, uh huh. It looks real good.
Sorry to say I haven't had to do any. That's why it's controlling okay.
Yes.
Wait until I do something.
Don't do any (laughter).
Oh, man, I just can't see the target or the COAS. Oh, there it is over there now.
Just can't see it.
Just can't see it, let me get in a little closer.
Dave, I just can't see it. Let me get in a little closer.
You're coming fine. Just keep coming easy like that. Looks like you are coming from an angle, but you are coming in with the right attitude. You ought to go forward and to your right a little bit, relative to your body.
You're fine.
That's it.
Right there.
That doesn't look like it to me.
No.
You get to come in from an angle anyway, so you're doing good.
How close are you?
I don't know.
Your yaw is off about 2 degrees.
I just can't see the darn COAS. I can't see what my attitude is.
Yes.
Okay. I'm lined up in translation, but I can't tell what my attitude is, Dave.
If I don't see it - There it is, there.
Now you're coming in.
That's looking better.
There you go.
I think you've got a handle on it now.
No.
It keeps disappearing.
Okay. Now you're looking pretty good.
Okay. You're moving into the boundary. You're inside the capture boundary now.
You're okay.
Looking good.
Okay. I can see it now.
Thing's really sporting.
It...
Sure is; I can tell. You are looking good.
Keep it coming.
You're...
Almost there.
Okay. You are about there.
I have capture.
Very good!
Great!
Free.
Okay, Let's get her lined up.
Okay. Why don't you do it? I can't tell where it is. We're in FREE now.
Good job.
Boy, we need a new COAS. This isn't a docking maneu...
Good show, Spider,
It's an eye test.
Roger. Our onboard fuel reading: 65 and 65 - Make it 55 and 55.
55.
Roger. 55 and 55. Thank you, Rusty.
Retract.
Did you get the latches?
Hang on.
We got those latches, baby!
Oh, did that sound good!
Whew! I haven't heard a sound like that in a long time!
And it's a very nice docking.
God dag...
That wasn't a docking; that was an eye test!
Okay.
Okay, Houston. We're locked up.
Sounds like you passed the 20-10, Jim. That sounded real beautiful. Good show.
Let's see something here. Just for fun (laughter). Whew! Range, range rate, not bad.
Okay, Spider. I'm in FREE and you're in FREE, and you may proceed into the tunnel here when I get squared away.
Roger.
Okay, Dave. We'll start getting ready for the unmanned APS.
Okay. Why don't you take a break for a while?
No, we've still got a lot to do.
Man, when I take a break, I'm going to bed for three days.
Roger.
Houston, did you get that?
Roger, Spider. Houston copies.
Here, you want to stick these in that center pocket?
Yes, let's take all...
We concur. Three days off.
Here.
What is that? Saturday and Sunday and Christmas?
Let's take and put all the - all the data...
That was a hard day's work; and it looked real good, troops.
Thank you, Smokey. I may.
and, hey - Ah, shoot.
Almost sure...
Smokey, you still there?
Yes, Jim. We're still got you for about another minute here.
Okay. Listen, I hope the whole world's listening, but I tell you I think we got greatest set of flight controllers that we've - is anyplace that can be found. I'd like to thank you all, and I'm sure that the rest of the guys up here would too.
Roger, Spider. We copy. Thank you very much.
What do I hear?
The S-band break-up.
No, I don't think so. Yes, it is, but it's a funny sound. Let's put that data in the center.
(Cough) Hold - hold it there just a minute.
Okay.
Gee. I don't. I was leaning my adam's apple up against my neckring.
Well, you got it over your hose, Jim. You're not going to get out of it. Hey, is that what you call a nominal rendezvous? Holy smoke! Except for the undocking.
Yes.
Here you go. Oop, oop, oop. Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Spider, I'm going to put it in a wide deadband hold here, so we don't lose the platform.
I'm going to put it in lockup and hold it there don't be too.
That a boy!
Say, I wonder if we ought to do a wide deadband attitude hold? No.
What are we going to do with all that fuel?
Use it for S - service module RCS deorbit, babe. You're not on the ground yet.
No, but we got - we got enough for two of those.
Well, we've still got 5 more days. I wonder if it'll control?
Hey, no. There's no docked DAP in this.
CSM.
No, but that's only with descent stage.
Oh.
I forgot about that, as a matter of fact. I'll tell you what. Let's take these clips back for souvenirs.
Yes. We ought to take the whole light.
Yes, take the COAS. Take the radiation survey viewer. Let's take back some souvenirs. If it's not screwed down, (laughter) take it back.
ARIA 6, this is Houston CAP COMM.
Wait until we start to use our parachutes, too.
Our what? Oh, yes.
Houston CAP COMM, ARIA 6.
Roger. Do you hear anything from the spacecraft?
Turn the tape off.
Okay, tape coming off.
That's negative at this time. We don't have an S-band signal.
Okay. If you get a lockup, would you call me on air-to-ground here? I'd like to talk to them.
That's roger.
Roger.
Houston, this is ARIA 6. Is two-way lock modulation ON?
Roger, ARIA 6. Go REMOTE.
Roger. We're REMOTE.
Hello, Spider/Gumdrop. This is Houston through ARIA 6. How do you read?
Spider, this is Houston through ARIA 6. Do you read?
Okay, ARIA. You can go LOCAL. I guess we aren't going to get them. We'll try them through Ascension. Thank you.
Go ahead, Houston. You just come in.
Roger. Spider, we are curious about the option on the AOT star alignment. Are you going to do that?
Houston, I don't know - how long do you have we have until that docked - that on-band APS burn, now?
Stand by.
I've got my flight plan tucked under my belt right now.
And, Houston, anytime you've got it, we'll take the update on the P30 for the APS burn.
Roger. Over and out.
Spider, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. The first opportunity we have, that we feel we can make, is about 102 hours; it's 101:52.
Okay. I'm just wondering about our difficulty in trying to clean up big messes when we're moving things back and forth; and if we take too much time out, I was concerned about getting the thing ready. We'll see how things go here. Okay?
Okay. There is - The first opportunity is a little over an hour from now, and I didn't even want to pass that on to you. It's your decision, but I don't think you can make that one.
Yes. I kind of doubt it, too.
Okay. We concurred to not even shoot for that one, and we're looking now at 101:52.
Gumdrop, do you read Houston?
Houston, do you call Gumdrop?
Roger. If we are going to do the AOT star alignment - I guess it'll depend on how things go, but I have some gimbal angles you'll need for that. I can give them to you anytime you want, if you want then at all.
Well, why don't you give them to me? Let me get a piece of paper, here, and we'll have them if we can use them.
Okay.
Gumdrop is ready to copy.
Roger. For star 15: roll 35 36 32 81 365; and star 25: 34 74 26 61 35 97.
Roger. Copy. For star 15: 35 36 32 81 365; for star 25: 34 74 26 61 35 97.
Roger. That is confirmed, Gumdrop. And one fast question: did you ever see the tracking light on Spider?
No; it was out when he got here.
Understand.
But the way this navigation works in here, you hardly need a nightside pass.
Gumdrop, Houston copies. Sounds great.
go next flight.
Spider, Houston.
Spider, Houston.
Houston, Gumdrop. Go.
Gumdrop, would you relay to Spider that we would sure like to have him check that OPS heater again before he stows that OPS that had failed? I'm going to lose you here, and we'll try to talk to you over Tananarive at around 25.
Roger. Understand. Spider, they want you to check the OPS heater, the one that failed, before you put it away.
Okay.
They got it, Houston.
Roger, Gumdrop. Copy. And I copied Spider there.
Gumdrop, you got the tunnel pressurized?
I'm doing it right now.
Dave, if you want, we can pressurize it for you.
Well, I'll get it halfway. Why don't you do it halfway?
Okay.
All the way.
I've still got a DELTA-P. Huh!
Maybe our pressure just isn't high enough.
No, ours is higher than his; ours is 5.2. DELTA-P may be the other way, Dave.
No, because I started out from one end of the, and worked halfway back to.
Okay, well, it's - The tunnel's 5.2.
Okay, it came down; it must have just been hung there.
Okay.
Thank you.
REG's A and B are in EGRESS.
Yes.
OVERHEAD VALVE is OPEN; stow OPS for - stow - stow helmet bags on the deck, yes.
They go in - Get them as close as you can, and as far forward as you can, Jim.
That's good.
Really is.
Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Hey...
Gumdrop, are we in any kind of...
an attitude for docked alignment?
Oh, I don't know. I guess - I'll check. What kind of attitude do you want?
I fired that one, Dave. Hey, right now we are in the right kind of attitude.
Hey, listen. Maybe if you went to FREE, and we took control here, we could just jockey around and do it.
Okay, I'm for that. I'll go to FREE, and you got, it.
Yes.
We have it.
But I'm 12 - 30 something - I guess 55 degrees from gimbal lock; we're okay.
But I'm not going to be able to monitor your attitude. Okay?
Okay.
Spider/Gumdrop, Houston through Tananarive.
Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston transmitting in the blind. I'm not picking you up. We would like to recommend you use the LM RCS just as much as possible. We used just a little more command module CSM RCS there than we'd predicted on the rendezvous.
Okay, Houston. This is the Spider here. We're using our RCS thrusters.
Okay. Real good.
Spider, Gumdrop.
Go ahead.
How about that mate? 12 latches again!
Hey, that's really great, isn't it?
Yes, all of them just locked in solid as they can be.
When you threw me off into oblivion out there, I was wondering if - I was wondering if I was ever going to hear those latches go "click" again.
Oh, yes, they were going to work.
That's already there, Jim.
Do you have a good pressure vessel over there?
Roger; we do.
Okay.
Wait a minute now; hold on there...
Okay, you can go either way.
Far wide.
No, I can't use pulse, Jim. I got to -
Jim, I can't help that!
Well, you couldn't mate...
Got mate.
And, Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston through Carnarvon.
Roger, Gumdrop.
And, Spider, do you read Houston. Are you too - Gumdrop, if they're too busy to answer, let me know.
Go ahead. Houston, Gumdrop.
Roger. Do you know if Spider's reading me or is just too busy - can't answer me?
We were reading you; we were kind of busy, Stu.
Okay, Gumdrop. At a convenient time, would like for you to pass to them this - We want to do a couple of steps on that AGS system troubleshoot - that warning light - prior to them doing the AGS give align and update.
Okay. We'll do that.
Okay.
Gumdrop, Houston. We're noticing your surge tank down a little.
Roger. That could be from the tunnel PRESS.
Roger
Boy, it is down a little, isn't it?
That's roger.
Okay. Spider, Gumdrop.
Go ahead.
Hey, listen, we're dropping off quite a bit on our surge tank, and I think it might be either the tunnel or you. The latches look good; I think we've got a good seal. How are you doing over there?
Okay. We got our cabin pressure way up to - We're 5.9. In fact, we're going to relieve it in a minute here.
Okay. Listen, maybe you ought to open that door. The surge tank is down to 400, and we ought to do something here pretty quick.
Roger.
Gumdrop, Houston. Could you check your cabin air return valve?
How about that.
Is the tunnel okay, Dave? I'll open up the door.
Yes. I've got the probe out.
Okay. Open the hatch.
And, Gumdrop, that's the suit return valve we'd like to have you take a look at.
Roger. You're right. That one was still closed.
I had just taken helmet and gloves off after going into the tunnel, and I hadn't opened that.
Okay, Houston. I see it. Surge tank's going back up.
Okay. Thank you, Gumdrop.
Thank you, Smokey.
Roger.
Houston, here's your dock alignment. Do you have the star angle difference?
Stand by. Spider, just one.
Okay. It's 5 zeros - give you the torque...
Hi, Dave!
Houston, are you ready to copy torqueing angles?
Okay. I have them now.
Okay. Understand you've got the torqueing angles.
Affirmative, Spider. I have the torqueing angles.
Okay.
And that's pretty good on that star angle difference. Way to work, big team!
Yes. Crazy? It's a little longer.
Yes. It's real swinging, and we're about to lose you at Carnarvon in 30 seconds, and we'll see you over Hawaii at 04.
Roger. Will you have a PAD by that time?
That's affirmative. I have the PAD in my hand now.
Okay. We'll see you at Hawaii with it.
Roger.
Okay.
Huh?
Well, no.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, they're somewhere that's real handy.
Well, shoot!
Wait a minute.
There's so much junk over here.
Huh?
Oh, I don't know - soon as - (laughter). Yes.
Huh?
Sure. It's the COAS.
Yes, we got plenty of room over there for stuff.
Are you still attitude-holding over there?
Okay.
Hey, listen, don't stow this quite yet.
Yes.
I'm going to take me a pee.
It what?
oh, come on. Dirty bastard outfaked me.
Gee, I thought I had one all figured out.
Hey, this thing is hot! Yes, whew!
Quite a surprise.
Those guys really make things strong.
Huh? This thing right here? Take that bolt out? - That bolt out, it comes right off. Take that off..
Yes, I got that big bagful of garbage.
Here you go. Huh? Wait, just wait a minute, until I.
Is the toolkit out, or did you put it back?
Oh, shoot! I was going to go find the toolkit, but it's not where the toolkit goes!
What do you want - the?
I wonder what happened to that thing.
Hey, Jim. You don't remember where you put the toolkit, do you?
No, sir.
You're lethargic!
Yes, here it comes. Huh?
Is that far enough?
Yes, that's as far as it goes.
Well - well, I guess you can get it one more - Yes, you can collapse it a little bit more.
Here, I'll get it.
I'm not sure we can do it out here. Pull it out to the green. Right there. Now stroke.
That's it. That's all the way.
What else you need?
Shouldn't we ought - You probably not ought to screw it up too much, because if the pyros don't go - That's the only way we're going to get off. Yes.
Yes, people will laugh. Not you.
Take those things off that and.
Take that off and give them a boop-boop!.
Oh, I'm sorry, Jim. Guess I was holding my too.
All this stuff is being recorded for the ground review.
Yes.
Okay.
You know what else we need to do? Bring all the logs.
What are you bringing that for?
Got anything for?
(Laughter} had.
Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston through Hawaii.
Hello, Hawaii, Gumdrop. We're making progress.
Roger. Understand. And whenever you all are ready, I have your APS depletion PAD and your LM jettison attitude.
Okay...
Rusty?
Stand by.
Roger.
And, Spider, Houston. We'd like to uplink your state vector. I noticed you are in P00 now. We can go if you will give us permission.
Is that for Spider or Gumdrop?
That was for Spider.
Roger, Houston. Say again. This Spider.
Roger, Spider. You are in P00. We'd like to uplink you a state vector.
Okay. Go ahead. And I am ready to copy your PAD.
Okay. And are you ready - Okay, here is the APS depletion: 101 52 4400, plus 52356, minus 52682, plus 00520 74275 314 023. Guess you really didn't need those, did you? Okay. Plus 48549, minus 52675, plus 19626. That's the end of the APS depletion PAD. And your LM weight: 9549.
Okay. On the readback I got 101 52 4400, plus 52356, minus 52682, plus 00520 74275 314 023, plus 48549, minus 52675, plus 19626; and LM weight: 9549.
Roger. And for the jettison attitude, I have angles for either the CSM or the LM, if you wanted to maneuver with the LM - save a little command module CSM RCS fuel.
Okay. Go ahead with them. I don't know which one we'll do.
Okay. Reading the angles for the LM: roll 314, pitch 023, yaw 011; and the CSM angle: 318.5, 282.0, 044.7. And we are through with the computer.
Roger. I understand that you are through with the computer. Be advised our docking ring angle now has changed, and therefore, I think, probably the CSM angles will have to be modified to a certain extent. Docking ring angle is now minus 0.2.
Roger. Understand docking ring is minus 0.2. How come you were so sloppy in roll there?
I don't think I'll say anything to that.
(Laughter)
Okay. And, Rusty, we've got a little troubleshooting, here, on the AGS - we'd like to do on that warning light. We don't know if you want to take the time or not.
Spider, this is Houston. Do I still have you?
All right. Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We've got a procedure here that we'd like to do concerning the AGS, and it's that caution light - We'd like to have you do this procedure prior to the AGS update in your checklist.
Roger.
Are you ready to copy?
Stand by. How long is it?
It's about five steps.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. Go ahead.
All right, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Step 1 is: perform normal turn-off procedure. Verify the AGS caution light goes out. Open, then close the caution CWEA circuit breaker. Perform the normal turn-on procedure. And then, after you have done this, why, reset the AGS time and update and align as normal checklist.
Okay. You want a normal AGS turnoff. You want to verify the AGS caution light out. Open and close CWEA breaker, perform a normal turn-on and update and align the AGS.
That is affirmative, Spider.
Hey, Jim. Are you going to do that checklist?
Okay. Seems to me there's one more thing I have got to get down here; I can't think of what it is.
Spider, Houston. We should have you through the Redstone now.
Redstone here.
Roger. Rusty, we also would like to request that you bring the LM COAS back into the CSM.
Roger. Do you have data at the Redstone here, Houston?
That's affirmative.
Roger. Do you want me to go through that procedure right now?
On the AGS? Yes, let's do.
Coming up.
Houston, Gumdrop.
Go ahead, Gumdrop.
Roger. Do you have any suggestions on anything else we might leave in the LM to lighten up the command module?
We copy that. Stand by. We'll put that in work. We'd like to have you turn off the fan in H2 tank 2.
All right.
The light is still on. caution light came on when I went to STANDBY on the powerup again, and it stayed on after pushing in the AEA breaker and going to OPERATE.
Roger. We copy.
Okay. We have no more questions. Rusty, if we could get you to cycle the track light on and off, we've got data now. Could you do that for us?
Spider. Track light on; track light off.
Okay. Rusty, could you do that for us once more? On your Mark.
Roger. 3, 2, 1.
MAPK.
Track light on. Let me know when you want it off.
Okay. Turn it off on your Mark.
Roger. 3, 2, 1.
MARK.
Track light off.
Okay. Thank you very much. And one other change to your checklist: in the closeout here, we want you to change - Put the S-band antenna on the number 2 AFT position. This is rendezvous page 41, step 10.
Roger. S-band antenna to AFT.
And, Spider, one other thing. We would like to - This is on rendezvous-42, step 5. Do not ascent feed system A. Leave system A in NORMAL and system B to ASCENT FEED INTERCONNECT.
Understand. Do not ASCENT INTERCONNECT SYSTEM Gumdrop, did you get that?
Yes. He didn't want one of the ascents interconnected, but I don't know whether it was A or B.
Spider, it is do not connect - interconnect system Alpha. Interconnect system Baker only.
Roger. Bravo only; and negative on the Alpha interconnect.
Very good. Thank you.
Okay. Rusty, one other thing: we want you to leave the track circuit breaker open.
Roger. Is that the track light circuit breaker?
That is affirmative. Your track light circuit breaker. It's rendezvous-43; step 3. We would like that open.
It's open now.
Very good. Thank you
Okay, Jim.
Commander.
Roger. Do you read?
Roger. Now I do.
Commander's suit isolation with suit disconnect; connect the LM hoses and stow; CDR transfer to the CSM with the ISA and the CDR rendezvous checklist - I've done that - We've got the index, and we've got the PLSS cartridge over here.
And do you have PLSS stowed now?
Roger. Go ahead. I have everything stowed on the floor. Go ahead and read it.

Just a second. Let me check some of the switches.
Yes. These are the same kind I've always used. Let me check another lead here.
Rusty, how do you read Houston?
You're five-square, Houston.
Do you want me to read the list?
No. That's okay.
Okay.
Houston, how do you read me?
I read you loud and clear, Jim.
Okay. I guess we're incompatible up here.
Okay. That's ascent number 1 O2 closed.

Okay, LMP transfer to the CSM umbilicals. We'll send them down to you in just a minute.
Okay.
Hey. Rusty. Houston. I want to remind you again that you're going to have to put new time in the AGS. That procedure we gave you wiped the time out of the AGS.
Roger, Houston. Thank you.
And, Rusty. Want to remind you again of that new LM weight we parsed you.
Roger. Understand.
there it goes. That was some state VEC you gave me. It integrated forever.
Roger. Understand.
Hey, Rusty, are you still up there?
Yes.
Okay. Are you switched over to the umbilical yet?
No. I'm loading the AGS here, Jim; just a minute.
Okay.
Okay. Want me to transfer over now?
Are you still on LM or on our COMM?
I'm on LM COMM.
Okay.
Stand by. I'll switch it over.
CSM umbilicals. And when you do that, we'll turn your suit flow on, and we'll turn your audio power off over here so we can switch over to it.
Okay. Dave?
Boy, sure getting a bunch of noise.
Dave?
Okay. You can turn on suit flow, Jim.
Okay.
Okay. Your suit flow is on.
Okay. And I'm going to be disconnecting the COMM here; and give me about a minute and you can connect up there.
Okay. Just a minute.
And, Gumdrop, this is Houston. At any convenient time - stand by one, Gumdrop. Disregard that.
Okay. We will disregard your message.
Roger. Understand.
Okay. Gumdrop, Houston. If you've got one of the troops in there with a spare hand to write, I could give you your block data now. That would be one thing out of the way for tonight.
Okay. Just a minute.
Roger.
Houston, this is Spider, I guess.
Roger, Spider I guess. This is Houston, I know.
Okay. If you can see the DSKY right now, you'll notice that the angles for NOUN 18 do not correspond with what you passed me on the data.
Okay, Rusty. That's something that I was wanting to get to you. The angles that I passed you were FDAI angles.
Roger. That's what I'm looking at, FDAI angles. However, yaw is not constrained, and it's a possibility that if we went to a right yaw angle that the pitch and roll would come in.
Roger. We agree with that, and we're having guidance reconfirm these angles now, Spider.
Houston, go ahead with the block data if you like.
Okay. I've got about minute here; I'll start reading: 065 4 Baker, plus 338, minus 1699, and Spider, we're saying if you do go to those angles - if you yaw, do that 011. That way we will have the right angles.
Okay.
I'm going to lose you here, Gumdrop. I'll finish up this block data over Ascension, and we'll hit Ascension at 42.
Understand; 42.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Apollo 9, Houston through Ascension.
Hello, Houston. This is Apollo 9. The Gumdrop right now, and we seem to not have the right angles on our DSKY.
Apollo 9, this is Houston. You sort of dropped out on me. We're showing the right angles on the LM DSKY. Are you saying your angles are not correct in the command module?
Apollo 9, Houston.
Apollo 9, Houston. If you read us, we are showing both vehicles in the proper attitude - proper angles.
Hey, Houston, this is Spider.
Go, Spider.
Roger. I want to notify you that on the AGS all day long, 407 has been jumping to a plus 1. I'm going to set it back to zero here, but there isn't a snowball's chance it's going to stay there until the burn time.
Roger. Copy. Understand.
And, Houston, this is Gumdrop here. Do you want us to be in minimum deadband to hold this thing here now?
Stand by, Gumdrop.
Gumdrop, Houston.
Gumdrop. this is Houston. If you read, we recommend in the CSM in MIN deadband.
Okay.
And Gumdrop/Spider, we'll see you over Carnarvon at 14, if you read.
14.
Hey, Houston, Spider.
Go ahead, Spider.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Houston. Roger. We're standing by for your logic switches.
Okay. Before that, do you have a separation attitude for us?
Affirmative. SEP attitude: roll, 137.4; pitch, 092.5; yaw, 021.9. And note your TIG is 101 plus 32 plus 44.
Okay. 137.4, 092.5. 021.9, at a TIG of 101 32 44. You're right there today.
Yes. Roger.
Okay. What's our jettison time to get off the LM?
Houston, we're ready to update.
Okay. We're standing by for your logic.
All right. Logic bus ON at this time.
Apollo 9, Houston. You have a GO for PYRO ARM.
Roger.
Houston, one other question: what time do you want us to jettison the LM - What time do you want us to get off the LM? Do you have any preference?
Roger. Ten minutes prior to your SEP maneuver or at 22.
Okay. Understand 22.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Houston. Go.
Roger. Just to clarify one thing in the procedure, there, in exiting the LM. We left the ascent interconnects on system Alpha CLOSED and on Bravo OPEN. We also ran the same configuration on the main shut-off valve; that is, we closed the main shut-off valve in system Bravo and left it open in Alpha. Hopefully, that's what you wanted.
9, Houston. Affirmative; that's good.
Okay; thank you.
9, Houston. Thirty seconds to LOS. Guam at 25, and it's looking good.
Okay; fine. Thank you.
9, Houston. Just as a reminder, we didn't see your pyros on yet.
Okay. I'll get them on in just another minute or two.
Apollo 9, Houston through Guam. Standing by.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Okay. Stand by, Houston.
Roger.
9, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS; Hawaii in about 39.
Roger.
9, Houston. Recommend limit cycle OFF.
Say it again.
Recommend limit cycle OFF.
Apollo 9, Houston through Hawaii.
Hello, Houston. This is Apollo 9. We were able to get that SEP maneuver off in the direction that we had intended. We did an automatic maneuver in the PGNCS that very carefully placed us gimbal lock, so we thrusted out to the side of it, and we have it in sight. We're all clear.
Roger. Understand you are well clear and we have a GO, then, for the LM maneuver.
Affirmative.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Houston. Go.
Roger. Could you refresh us on the burn time?
Roger. The burn time is at 52 plus 44.
Thank you.
9, Houston. The burn time is really 53 plus 14. I can give you a clock time here at 11 minutes, or do you want it?
Okay.
15 seconds to 11 minutes.
Okay.
4, 3, 2, 1.
MARK.
Eleven minutes.
Roger.
9, Houston. The LGC is all set up, and the engine is ARMED.
Roger. Very good.
Apollo 9, Houston. About 2 minutes to go; do you still feel comfortable in your position?
Oh, yes. We're well clear.
Roger.
He's burning like mad, Houston. Looks real nice.
Very good; it's looking good down here.
Hey, it's really moving out.
Houston, that engine's still burning away like mad.
Very good. We've got about 4-1/2 more minutes, and it looks like about the only thing we got is a very slight pitch oscillation.
We can still see out there, Houston. He's really a long ways away.
Okay.
I hope I didn't forget anything onboard it.
We do, too.
Did you get the LMP?
No. I didn't forget him. I left him there on purpose. (Laughter)
Okay.
And, Houston, we have fuel cell 2 warning light on.
Roger.
C E, Houston.
Roger. It looks like condenser exhaust.
Yes.
Roger. It's the same thing we've been seeing all day.
Hey, Huston. Do you read Apollo 9?
Houston, Roger. We've got about 45 seconds yet. We just had shutdown.
Roger. He put out a big cloud of white stuff.
Roger. Copy.
He's sure a long ways away.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Houston. Go.
Roger. What time do you expect to give us the block data?
Roger. I'll give it over MILA at 57.
Okay. 102 57.
Roger. Negative. 101 57.
Alrighty. 200.
Wait a minute. I've got the wrong data here.
Be at MILA at 22.
Roger. 22.
Apollo 9, Houston through Antigua.
Apollo 9, Houston through Antigua.
Apollo 9, Houston through Antigua.
Houston, Apollo 9.
9, Houston. I'll give you a couple of block datas here, and then we'll recompute them and give you everything with block data 12.
Okay.
You're free to read them.
Okay. 065 4 Bravo, plus 338, minus 1699 102 56 23 4825; 066 3 Alpha, plus 312, plus 1446 l04 20 28 4821.
Apollo 9, Houston through Tananarive.
Houston, Apollo 9. How do you read?
Oh, not too bad. Same thing from Tananarive. We'll try it, though.
We've got a couple of questions for you.
Roger. Go.
Okay. First, fuel cell 2 seems to be slipping down the power curve there; we're about 2 AMPS low on it. The PTU is still running high and kicking on the MASTER ALARM every once in a while. The other question is H2 pressures. Tank 1 is now registering about 261 or so and - oh, yes - 275. Tank 2 is about - Tank 1 is about 262, and tank 2 is about 275.
Okay. I think that last thing you were talking about was H2 tank pressures, and if it's gone up above 26O, go ahead and turn them off. We plan to pump them up again tonight and let them decay while you are sleeping.
Roger. We cut the heaters off on the H2 cryo.
9, Houston. Are you still with me?
Houston, 9. We're broken. We've got the H2 heaters off at the present time.
Roger. Copy. We'll delete BATT A charge tonight.
Apollo 9, Houston through Guam.
Roger. Hello. Houston, Apollo 9. Go ahead.
Roger. We have your state vector; we request P00 and ACCEPT.
Okay. You have P00 in ACCEPT.
Roger.
We didn't copy much over Pretoria and Tananarive. Will you say again what you were talking about on the fuel tells and the cryos?
Okay. I think you turned the H2 heaters off there, I hope.
That's affirmed.
And when you turned them off, did you go from the ON position, or from the AUTO position to OFF?
We went from AUTO to OFF.
Okay; afraid of that.
Didn't like that, huh?
No.
Pressures were getting up pretty high. Do you want to go to ON now?
Okay. Let me tell you our plans now. What we'd like to do is take them on up to 275-270, sorry - by your MANUAL cycle and then heaters and fans OFF. We'd like to do that just as late as we can prior to your rest cycle.
Okay. We'll run them up to 270 and then turn them off and leave the heaters and fans off, too; is that right?
Yes; for the night. And we're hoping we can get a 12-hour decay there before we hit the MASTER ALARM again.
Okay; but you want to leave everything off overnight. Is that right?
That is affirmative.
Okay.
Hey, you, might tell Jim we got a - Papa Alpha Tango and about three little ones here really proud of today's operations.
What did you say, Ron?
I said we've got Papa Alpha Tango back there in the back room and three little ones, and they are really proud of today's operations.
Say hello to those four, would you, please?
Will do.
On second thought, I'll say hello. Hello, there.
Okay, 9. We'd like to delete the BATT A charge.
Very well.
Okay. For RETRO's needs down here, he would like to know - We'd like to get a list of the non-checklist items that you left in the LM and also the non-checklist items that you might have brought back from the LM.
Okay. Stand by one.
And while you're standing by, how about the fuel cell, what do you think about that?
Okay. On the fuel cell, what we're hoping is that as soon as power down, the exhaust temperature - It should come down, and also it ought to even up the load again.
Okay.
We're not too hot about doing an H2 purge because - of course - it uses is little bit of hydrogen there.
Yes, that's true. Do you want to do any O2 purges tonight?
Whatever's on the flight plan.
Okay. We'll do an O2 purge.
Ron?
Go.
We left a left big bag - temporary storage bag - it's about 3 feet long and a foot wide and a foot thick over on the LM, and it was full of garbage; food wrappers and things like that. It didn't weigh very much, but it probably must have weighed 10 pounds or so. We didn't bring anything significant back with us in the way of weight. We do have a lithium hydroxide canister out of the and that's probably the heaviest item that we have, and we haven't found a place to stow it yet. Let me - It's probably down somewhere on the aft bulkhead. Probably down towards the lover equipment bay.
Okay. We copy that.
Apollo 9, Houston. How about the COAS - LM COAS, did it come back?
Oh, Roger. I got the LM COAS.
Okay. Good.
I don't think we have anything that weighs anything, though. I tell you what we'll have to do, Ron. We brought the books back. We got all the checklist stuff back with us, but we didn't have time to sort out the numbers so we have two whole - That probably weighs another 5 or 8 pounds.
Okay. We understand that.
And we'll have to rearrange some of the things on the spacecraft, and we'll let RETRO know where we put them. Okay?
Okay. Good idea.
9, Houston. You've got it up there and we've checked and compared. So I've got a NAV check, but I don't think you'll need it.
Oh, if you say it's a good one, it's a good one. We'll take what we got.
Roger. Jim, a question to you. Did you do another OPS check, and if so, any results?
I checked the OPS again, and the light still didn't come on.
Roger. Copy.
Yesterday Rusty checked it and he couldn't get - The light didn't come on. I went over and checked it again and it came on line. As a matter of fact, they came on four or five times. Then I went ahead and left it there, didn't say anything about it; I just thought we hadn't done it right. Went back over there today and they didn't work at all for either one of us.
Okay.
Houston. Check your middle gimbal.
Roger. We see. We're going to power down the platform here in a minute.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston through Hawaii.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 9. Go.
Roger. Got you loud and clear, now. Dave, while I've got you there, we haven't had any EKG on you all day, so when you - You might do a little troubleshooting here this evening sometime.
I'll tell you one reason you don't have it right now, is that I'm not plugged in.
Yes, but we didn't have any all day long on you, just on the EKG part of it. We had the respiration.
Let's square away the block data first, though.
Okay. We're working on the block data, and we should have it before we leave here.
Okay. I'll be all set.
By the way, our LOS of Texas is about 30.
Okay.
We're curious if you might have any additional comments on the LM jettison there.
No. It went off pretty clean. We had a bang like a regular pyro, and pushed us back with a - I guess something like 4/10 of a foot per second. It's sort of hard to tell, but that's what it felt like; it was supposed to be. It looked like a clean separation, the docking ring looked clean, and we couldn't see too much of it because it went away pretty fast. And gosh, we must have been a mile a half away when it finally burned.
Okay.
The maneuver to the separation attitude didn't work out so good. I guess we never tried it in a simulator. We sort of slipped into gimbal lock, but I think we got to the right position.
Okay.
Anything else?
The angles that we got were new and different, and we just were watching the LM, because...
Okay. And by the way, the LM is in an orbit 37 - about 3750 miles by 125.
Oh really?
Yes.
9, Houston. We could also use some dosimeter readings.
We thought you'd probably ask for that.
Roger.
Okay. Rusty's was 8012, and mine and Jim's are packed way down on the bottom of somewhere.
I Understand. 8012. Your waste water is up to about 90 percent now, so you may be wanting to dump that a little bit early.
Okay. We were going to do it at 104, but I guess we can do it here in a jiffy. Thank you.
Apollo 9, Houston. You might tell Jim that his guests can hear him now. They didn't hear him before.
Apollo 9, Houston. I have your block data when you're ready to copy.
Go ahead, Apollo 9.
9, Houston. You ready to go for block data on REV 66?
Roger. You read?
Roger, I have you now.
I guess you didn't read me for a minute there. Okay. Go ahead; I'm ready.
Okay. 066 3 Alpha, plus 312, plus 1446 104 20 28 4824; 067 3 Bravo, plus 338, plus 1485 105 54 57 4816; 068 3 Alpha, plus 317, plus 1446 107 27 50 4789; 069 Charlie Charlie, plus 268, plus 1390 109 00 44 4768; 070 Charlie Charlie, minus 231, minus 1600 110 53 53 4540; 071 Charlie Charlie, minus 313, minus 1600 112 27 57 4310; 072 Alpha Charlie, plus 133, minus 0330 113 03 29 4748; 073 2 Alpha, plus 261, minus 0310 114 39 06 4827; 074 Alpha Charlie, plus 322, minus 0320 116 12 55 4859. And SPS trim: pitch, minus 0.89; yaw, minus 1.12. Over.
Roger. I missed the first two lines of the one that came after area 069 Charlie Charlie - the next area.
Okay. Area 070 Charlie Charlie latitude: minus 231.
And the longitude?
Longitude: minus 1600.
Okay. You ready to have them come back?
Roger. Go.
066 3 Alpha, plus 312, plus 1446 104 20 28 4824; 067 3 Bravo, plus 338, plus 1485 105 54 57 48l6; 068 3 Alpha, plus 317, plus 1446 107 27 50 4789; 069 Charlie Charlie, plus 268, plus 1390 109 00 44 4786; 070 Charlie Charlie, minus 231, minus 1600 110 53 53 4540; 071 Charlie Charlie, minus 313, minus 1600 112 27 57 4310; 072 Alpha Charlie, plus 133, minus 0330 113 03 29 4748; 073 2 Alpha, plus 261, minus 0310 114 39 06 4827; 074 Alpha Charlie, plus 322, minus 0320 116 12 55 and 48559, with a pitch trim of minus 0.89 and a yaw trim minus 1.12.
Hey, good job.
You guys are getting more of these every day.
That's a good long one, there.
You must think we're going to stay up here forever.
Hey, speaking of staying up here forever, what time are you going to wake up in the morning?
That's just what we're talking about here. We're just thinking maybe we'll let you know and we'll give you a call. You know.
That sounds like a good idea.
Okay. That's all we'll do. We'll just let you sleep, and we'll give you a call - or you give us a call whenever you want to. If we don't call you.
(Laughter) How about 304 7 Alpha Charlie?
Okay. By that time for sure. And just out of curiosity here, seeming you all sound pretty chipper up there. How you doing?
We're pretty good. As a matter of fact, none of us had anything to eat all day long except for the breakfast we had which was like 30 hours ago, I think. We're all in pretty good shape.
I think Rusty and I had an advantage over Dave because the water in the LM tastes better than the water in the command module.
Roger. And I guess no medication is on the thing. We've got about 30 seconds here - 10 seconds LOS and if you can give us the consumables through Tananarive, fine; otherwise forget it.
What's that? BAT B in PYRO A.
Oh, you know, we're supposed to put this -
Didn't want to reply.
That's right, Dave.
Hey, you know what I seem to do is you got to hold on. I hit the ceiling.
too bad you don't have the golden slippers.
Got a point. See the whole. If you lean backwards too long,.
Is it really?
Go get your color picture.
Huh?
I got the CDH in the wrong direction.
Yes, it was.
Yes, sir, that hurt got a program.
Yes. I know.
Whoopee!
I don't know; we just changed that one out.
No, it's the seems sort of hot, isn't it?
I just went through all my -
Apollo 9, Houston through Tananarive.
Roger, Houston. We're still here.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Too late, huh? Did camera ever -
Sure. Just wind it around and look at the skies, and all that stuff.
You're right. I. That's kind of good.
Yes.
Besides, it's.
Yes, I know. Yes, I was thinking about it.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Houston. 9.
Roger, Dave. We showed a CMC restart between our last state vector update and the Redstone pass. Did you power it down and then back up?
Yes. We had it in STANDBY and we had our gimbal lock -
light -
on which had our PGNCS -
light on.
and we decided to go back to power everything up so we could get the IMU coarse aligned out of gimbaled lock so we wouldn't have our lights on during the night. Did we bomb you?
Roger. But we're satisfied now with the restart then.
Okay. We didn't get our restart light, though.
Hey, Rusty.
He's.
Roger. It's normal. It just adds our counter down here when you power up.
Oh, oh.
Yes; that's right. You have our reading on. Okay.
On the H2 pressures, if it looks like it's going to trigger the MASTER ALARM, we'll wake you up for a manual REPRESS, and then you can go back to sleep.
Okay, fine.
We don't expect it, though.
Alright. You might have to holler a couple of times.
We're almost through with that one, Jim.
I know.
Alright.
Okay,.
(Laughter)
Apollo 9, Houston. Congratulations from the Gold Team; it was a very fine day. We'll see you in the morning.
Oh.
Thank you very much, Gold Team. You guys did a very fine job, too.
Roger.
Somebody else wants to make a comment.
Hello, is this the wonderful Gold Team?
Houston, this is Apollo 9; this is Apollo 9.
Hello, Houston.
Hello, Houston.
Houston. Go.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
I just want to tell you guys -
That was a great job you all did today.
Thank you.
Yes, I -
I thought the higher ground team was about as good as anything I've ever seen or ever hope to see. I want to congratulate you all.
Roger, Thank you very much.

Hey, we're ending up - the deorbit burn with - 55 percent propellant.
This profile shows 55 percent RCS when you get to the deorbit burn. What the heck! - If you don't - use it - what's it up here for?
Here's two sets of bacon bars.
I got one of those. I like them.
Where's my peaches.9
Yes, they really are, aren't they?
the S-band.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger. Did you just waken up there, Dave?
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston. I understand you got - Looks like we're seeing a MASTER ALARM down here. You've got a condenser exhaust temperature low on fuel cell 2, and we've got some recommended switching for you.
Okay. I've been watching that. Go ahead.
Okay. Dave. What we'd like you to do is put the CMC to OPERATE, and once you're in OPERATE, go to P00 and turn inverter 3 - place inverter 3 - on MAIN A.
Okay. Bring CMC up to P00 and put inverter 3 on MAIN A.
That's firm, Dave.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go.
Roger. Apollo 9. Houston. While we've got you up, we're having a little trouble getting some down range. We'd like you to place the S-band at normal transponder, switch to OFF for 4 seconds, then to SECONDARY.
Roger. S-band normal transponder to OFF, then into SECONDARY.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. We've got inverter 3 on MAIN A, and we're in P00.
Roger. Apollo 9, Houston. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
How's everything doing down there?
Oh, pretty smooth down here except for watching condenser exhaust temperature vary a little bit on us. Sorry that you had to get awakened with the MASTER ALARM.
At least you're watching for us.
We're watching you.
Okey-doke.
Apollo 9. Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. We're having some difficulty commanding downlink, and so we'd like you to go PCM bit rate to HIGH, and we'll just leave it that way for the rest of the night.
All right, Houston. HIGH.
Alrighty. Thank you, sir.
Roger.
