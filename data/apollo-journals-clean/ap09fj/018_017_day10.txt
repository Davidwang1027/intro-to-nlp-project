Apollo 9, Houston.
Hello, Houston, Apollo 9.
Boy, Dave, you sure do wake up in a hurry. I never have to call you more than once
Well, we're expecting you every morning.
Well, good morning and all that good jazz. We'll have to think up something jazzy to wake you up with tomorrow.
Hey, I've got a question here for you.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. You're over the Canaries now. When you come across Australia, you're going to hit it with a - it's going to be almost sunset, but almost enough light for a picture. I was wondering if you could get a picture. It's generally dark down there, and we don't get many chances. This gives you about 30 minutes to get ready for it.
Roger, Houston. We'll do that.
Okay, If you've got something to write on now, I'll give you a time.
Okay. Go ahead.
209 plus 27 plus 11, four frames, 10 second exposures shooting on the nadir. You're shooting on the nadir. You're shooting the west coast of Australia - and it's for geology and oceanography.
Okay. 209:27:11, four frames, 10 second intervals, on the nadir. We can get that one.
Okay. Real good. And like I say, it's coming up - it will be a - a little sun angle, but maybe we can hack it, and at your convenience, we'd like to have inverter 3, Off, and the rendezvous radar transponder, Off.
Okay. Inverter 3 is Off and we'll go down and get the transponder
Okay. And we'd like to turn the fans off in both H2 tanks.
Okay. H2 fans are both Off
Okay. Our good old RCS configuration for the day will be quads Baker and Charlie, and Baker Delta roll.
Okay, and make that H2 tank 1 fan, On, please.
Okay. Baker and Charlie, and Baker Delta roll.
Okay. H2 tank 1 fan is On.
Very good. And you might whip up your old S-band volume there. We'll have Madrid here for 4 or 5 minutes.
Okay. S-band is up.
Houston, how do you read Apollo 9?
I'm reading you loud and clear, Jim.
Okay. Like you say, it wasn't getting out before, I guess I just didn't have all these things plugged in quite right. One of my things keeps coming loose.
Maybe it's wearing out. Good morning.
Hello there.
Hey, I've got a little question. How come we almost never use quad A? At least it seems to be the least one that we require the least out of for Service Module RCS deorbit, yet we seem to have the most fuel in it.
Okay. Stand by one, here, and let me give you a good answer on that.
Okay, Apollo 9. The answer to that one is that you require the most out of that for an SPS deorbit and we're trying to hang on to the SPS deorbit capability.
Okay. That's a pretty good answer.
Okay. All set - go ahead.
All right. Hours 209 42 10 42 12 38 13 39 13 2 4 3 15 31 33 39; and your DAP redlines: 25 31 34 34. End of update.
Roger. 209 42 10 42 12 38 13 39 13 2 4 3 15 31 33 39 25 31 34 34
That is affirmative, and that's correct.
Okay.
Roger. 209 plus 25 for battery A charge.
That's correct and I'll wait until we get over Carnarvon for the rest of the block data - I mean to get the block data and the rest of the Flight Plan updates - so we'll probably then lose Madrid here within a minute. It will be Carnarvon at 24.
Roger. You don't havppen to have a handy map update, do you?
That is affirmative. Your map update: 208:34:44, 73 degrees west.
Roger. That's pretty snappy. 208:34:44, 73 degrees west.
Roger, Doc. And I meant to get that for you. I had it all sitting out here and blew it.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. We'd like to start a battery A charge at 209 plus 25.
Oh, listen, that's all right. Looks like you must have told them...
No, I had - I had just updated my map here to check that Australia bit. And we'll see you down there. I hope you make before sunset.
Oh, we'll make sure. We wouldn't miss Australia for anything.
Hey, look at this rare opportunity you have. Australia in the daylight.
How about that!
Yes, he's doing alright. That could be part of the group. We're going exactly backwards.I can't see what's coming. Yes, we're going past Sumatra, right now.
Oh, look where we took those other pictures at. Yes, that's.
Apollo 9, Houston; 1 minute LOS. We'll see you over the sunny Caribbean around 10..
Okay, we'll be ready.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
Roger.
Fine. We're all set to take pictures.
Very good. Looks like you're in a race with the terminator.
Yes. It sure does, it's getting dark pretty quick.
Roger. I checked the sunset time on that. On the ground you'll be taking with about 2 minutes or a little over before sunset. We'll say a 5-degree sun angle.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. Bring up your S-band volume. We'll be going over Honeysuckle in about a minute.
Okay.
Looks like all those people down in Australia probably still asleep.
Well let me see, they shouldn't have gone to bed yet, should they? It just got dark across there.
Oh, that's the way the Sun goes. It goes from east to west. I thought it went from west to east.
(Laughter) Well, I've got a gauge here. I can call up the display and I can watch the terminator move so I don't have to do any thinking.
Stu, would you send that gauge up here?
Roger.
And we'll have Honeysuckle about 7 or 8 minutes. It might be a good place to get the block data at y'all's convenience. When you get through looking across the mainland, there.
And we've got you locked up on Honeysuckle now - about 6 minutes.
Okay. You're loud and clear on old Honeysuckle today.
You're coming in five-square.
Is it really only 3:30 in the morning in Houston?
That's affirmative.
I always hate to mention that - the time - because I thought it might make you (laugh) harder to get up.
If I'd just known then what I know now.
Come on, now.
Apollo 9, Houston. We'd like to know if you happened to notice any stratification when you stirred the cryos this morning.
Yes, we haven't done it yet, Stu.
Okay, very good. We've just seen some funnies on our last data pass, there.
All I've done is turn off the H2 fan and turn on the H1 fan.
Okay. Understand.
Of course we've turned the transponder on, too.
Very good.
How about a crew status report if you're up there; we'll make the Surgeon happy. Just get that out of the way right off.
Okay. The commander had about 7½ hours sleep and one vitamin pill.
And the CMP had about 7½ hours sleep and one vitamin pill.
And the LMP had about 6½ hours sleep and one vitamin pill.
Roger. Copy all that and good morning, Rusty.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. We're about 30 seconds from LOS Honeysuckle. Mercury around 42.
Okay. I think we'll stop and have breakfast now.
All right. Sounds like a good idea.
Well, we'll make sure.
We wouldn't miss Australia for anything.
How about that?
Apollo 9, Houston through Mercury. Standing by.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go ahead, Apollo 9.
Roger. Our power was down a little bit there so we just put the transponder back on to keep that same power we would on the fuel cells.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 9, Houston. One minute LOS, we'll see you over the sunny Caribbean around 10.
Okay, we'll be ready.
Roger
Oh, boy! I'm tired, so tired. That muscle that I've developed in my back is just - It keeps grabbing me bends me the wrong way.
(Laughter)
too. Boy, it sure catches.
(Singing)
Well, I don't know of any that we took.
Hey, I'm just - Jim,.
Yes, I thought of that, too. We ought to call the ground right now and tell them to flag the photo guys on that EVA film. That's something really looking for. I have this horrible feeling that run it through the bath. I don't - What - what MAG is that?.
E, Echo.
Apollo 9, this is Houston. We've got you through MILA. Standing by.
Roger, Houston.
Hey, Smokey. One thing that we're a little concerned about here, this morning we're going to be dipping back into a magazine of film that was taken with a slightly faulty camera. On the EVA we took the 70mm wide angle out with magazine Echo on it and we found out subsequent to the EVA that the superwide was keeping the shutter open too long, or at least we think that it did, so we ran off an extra 10 or so frames with nothing on them. Now we're going to use the remaining 100 today, so we want to make sure that when that film pack gets back that the photo people know about it that the first part of the film, the first third, may be exposed different from the last third - for the last two thirds, rather.
Okay. Understand now. To make sure that we got that, that 70mm and the magazine is Echo.
That's affirmative. We're not really sure when the camera malfunctioned, so the first third may also be okay, but we don't have any way of knowing it. We know that the superwide keeps the shutter open for about three to five times as long as it should, it looks like, and so we're going to need special handling on the first third of that roll of film.
Okay. Suspect the superwide may have kept the shutter open two to three times normal. And on that same subject, Rusty, we were just kicking around here, a 1 16mm magazine is the word I have that may have been exposed at a wrong setting during EVA. Is this correct?
Yes, that's affirmative, Houston, some of the 16mm magazines may have been exposed at the wrong setting.
Okay. At your convenience would you like to give us that magazine identification so we could sure that the word gets out?
Okay. We'll have to find out what the number of it wsa.
Roger. I suspect it's probably buried down somewhere, but anyway you'd like - but we would like to know it so we could warn people.
Okay. Well it was - we took some of the stuff apparently set at 1/60 and the rest of it at 1/250, so it's going to be a little tough to retrieve, I think. Let me get the magazine letter for you.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. There are a couple of targets we'd like photographed on this rev if you're so inclined. One is around the Red Sea area about 15 minutes from now and the other one is about 17 minutes after it.
Houston. I believe the magazine letter was P, magazine Peter, Papa, and we took about two-thirds of it during the EVA. The first part of it was probably exposed at 1/60 of a second and the remainder at 1/250.
Roger. Copy. You exposed two-thirds of it during the EVA and the first third at 1/60 and the rest at 250.
Roger. And they're the same subject material for it.
Roger. Copy. Thank you very much.
Okay.
Okay. Go ahead with the updates. Stu, the photo update.
Okay. The first one: time, 210 plus 39 plus 34; seven frames; 16-second interval; zero degrees; and this will be the Red Sea; oceanography. The second one: time 2 plus 10 plus 52 plus 07; three frames; 20-second interval; you'll be shooting north of the nadir 30 degrees. This is weather and should be a tropical depression up there.
Okay. Let me see if I got these right: 210:39:14, seven frames, 16 second intervals, zero degrees, Red Sea, Oceanography; 210:50:07, three frames, 29 seconds, north 30, weather, tropical depression.
Okay. The time on the Red Sea is 39 plus 34.
39 plus 34. Okay.
And the time on the tropical depression is 52 plus 07.
52:07. Right.
And, Apollo 9, I have some block data. At your convenience, I'll pass it to you.
You're still good for about another rev and a half, so no sweat on the time.
Okay. Let's go ahead and start it now.
Say again, Rusty.
Yes, I'm ready to copy, Stu.
Okay. I'll tell you what, Rusty, we're through the Vanguard now and it's a little static. Let's wait until we get handed over to Canaries. I think it would be better.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston. How do you read?
Five-square, Houston.
Okay. I have block data number 21 when you're ready to copy.
All set.
Reading: 135 2 Bravo, plus 292, minus 0270 213 16 11 3255, 136 2 Bravo, plus 226, minus 0330 214 53 00 3332; 137 1 Alpha, plus 276, minus 0680, 216 19 52 3380; 138 4 Alpha, plus 331, minus 1624 218 58 21 3232; 139 4 Alpha, plus 331, minus 1624 220 39 20 3026; 140 4 Baker, plus 286 minus 1640 222 20 10 3200. Would you bring up your S-band volume here before I continue? We'll be handing over into Madrid shortly. And pitch, minus 0.64, yaw, minus 0.94. End of update.
Okay, Stu. Readback: 135 2 Bravo, plus 292, minus 0270 213 16 11 3255, 136 2 Bravo, plus 226, minus 0330 214 53 00 3332; 137 1 Alpha, plus 276, minus 0680, 216 19 52 3380; 138 4 Alpha, plus 331, minus 1624 218 58 21 3232; 139 4 Alpha, plus 331, minus 1624 220 39 20 3026; 140 4 Baker, plus 286 minus 1640 222 20 10 3200. Pitch, minus 0.64, yaw, minus 0.94.
Roger. That readback is correct. Thank you.
Okay.
And, Apollo 9, about 1 minute LOS Madrid; and we'll see you over Carnarvon around 58.
Roger. Carnarvon around 58.
Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon.
Roger, Houston.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. We'd like to use Alpha Charlie's roll today, instead of Baker Dog as we passed up before.
Understand: Alpha Charlie roll instead of Bravo Dog.
That's affirmative, and just a little note on that. What we'd like to do is get into that secondary propellant tank on one of the quads and we think that'll probably be quad C and this one allows any of our deorbits. We'll still have our SCS deorbit capability.
Okay.
The action has been took.
Very good. Thank you.
Say there, worker of miracles. What's the balmy picure on the surface in the recovery area?
I can find that out for you. I have neglected to mention that subject so far here. I was going to wait until you brought it up.
I was afraid you were going to...
And, Apollo 9, Houston. I have you about another 6½ minutes to Carnarvon here, and I have five or six items on the Flight Plan update for today.
Okay, stand by.
Okay. Go ahead, Stu.
Okay. The first one is at 212 plus 38 and I'll just make this comment now which will apply later in here. As you see it in your timeline everything is shifted around 20 minutes or so due to the orbit, so if it looks like night or day or something is off, well that's the reason. But at 212 plus 38 we'd like to have a P51, P52 alignment to P52 to Nominal, and your T-align is 216 plus 10 plus 00.
Okay. Now, at 214 plus 30 - and want to make sure we don't get confused here - I'm deleting the second S065 pass here - the one that is shown for over Africa. Now in your Flight Plan that's shown right around 215, but that is the pass. We're deleting that S065 pass due to weather. We still want the first S065 pass across the States, and we'll have a pass for you later on that. Okay, now, 215 plus 38 for P52 to REFSMMAT. And at 217 plus 10, we'd like to have a COAS calibration. Now, you gave us a real good alignment yesterday with the COAS, and on the change of shift of the flight planning people here, I can't find any good details on why we want another one. I think there's a requirement that says that you need one the day before re-entry. But it looks like you've probably got a good one, but we'll stick that one in there - 217 plus 10. And at 217 plus 50, we'll do some P22 landmark tracking.
Your powerdown will be 218 plus 35, and at 219 plus 00 we'll have a fuel cell O2 purge. And that's the end of it.
Okay. 212 38 P51, 52 to Nominal 216:10:00. At 214:30 we want to delete the second S065 pass over Africa due to weather. We still want to keep the first one across the States. 215:38 P52 to REFSMMAT; 207:10 COAS calibration; 217:50, P52 landmark track; 218:35 power down, 219:00, fuel cell O2 purge.
That's affirmative, Rusty. You got them all. And I'd just like to ask a question on curiosity; I was wondering how that Y and N panel worked out.
Oh that works great, Stu. Good job on that.
How about with the corona pack? Do you get - Does it fit in there all right? You know we really need a mount around that, and I was wondering about the light leak around the edge.
Well, I had trouble getting the Verb-Noun list out. It took me about 5 days to get that out, and when I finally go that out, I haven't had a chance to put the corner pack up.
You mean it was jammed in there?
Yes, it sure was.
Ouch, that doesn't sound like it was so good. Sorry about that.
Oh, no sweat. I think we'll work that out when we get back.
Stu, I have a question on the S065. Looks like we have many more frames of film left on the camera there than we have allocated for pictures today. I don't think we ought to come back with any film left in those cameras.
Roger. Copy, Jim.
And I guess, what I'm saying is that soon as we get through those S065's that are programmed, I thihnk we'll just leave it in the window and take pictures until we run out.
Yes, we're going to use it all today and it's being planned that way.
Oh, okay. Fine.
And Jim, just to clarify it, this 16mm roll taken during EVA that you exposed 2/3 of it - that is all that's been exposed on that roll, is that affirmative?
That's affirmative. We're going to go take some Sun going down into the water pictures with the rest of it.
Okay. Very good. So the rest of it will be exposed, but we're really looking at the first 2/3 of it on the EVA.
That's affirmative.
Okay. Real good.
We've got to make sure that's developed right.
Roger. Copy, Jim.
And let's have S-band volume up, please.
You took part of it at 1/250. All with the same subject matter.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Apollo 9, Houston through Mercury.
Roger Houston, you're coming five-square.
Reading you real good, and we'd like to have the fan in H2 tank 1, Off at this time.
Okay. H2 tank 1 fan, Off.
Roger, thank you. And I have the temperatures in the recovery areas, water temperature is 69. The air temperature is 64. That's as of 1000 Z this morning.
Okay, they have the forecast with them for tomorrow. Stu, as far as temperatures or anything else goes?
Well, we've got a forecast yes, I suppose you're interested in that?
The way you worded that you stimulated our interest.
Okay, now I don't know what to say.
Okay, here's the way it stacks up. I'll read it to you straight. 1530 2000 scattered variable, broken, high broken clouds, 10 miles. Visibility, wind. 31 knots. Waves 68 feet swell 10 to 12 feet. How does that sound?
Nice visibility.
Hey, that was a beautiful answer. Okay. 1530, 2 thousand scattered 10 miles. Visibility, wind light and variable waves two to three feet and swell six to seven feet.
Hey, let's go there! Let's go there!
Yes. Take a pick, Stu.
Roger.
Gee you sure made that dramatic Stu.
The weather I read you first was the prime recovery area.
Are they still considering it to be the prime one they're going to shift it down one rev.?
This has not been decided yet, Jim. Of course, that will come here within a few hours. But just reading the weather, I'm sure you can make that decision also.
Yes. What kind of backup capabilities do we have if we don't get an SPS retro and have to do Service Module RCS retro for the following Rev? where does that put us with respect to land? Will we still come down on the water?
Okay, Jim that's what we're hustling so much over here right now. And what's making the retro all gray headed. We don't have one on the next rev in the Atlantic so that's what gets this hairy is the - that we go to the backup area here, which the weather certainly dictates well then that puts us into the Pacific for a back up deorbit.
Okay. If we go into the Pacific, how does the propellant requirement change with respect to our anomaly for retro into the Pacific?
No real change, Jim, and I think we're looking what? Around Hawaii - is it that - the backup landing area is in the Hawaii area
How's the weather there?
We are thinking we haven't got a real good hack on it yet. Retro and recovery are hustling that out right now, Jim.
Okay, I think I know which way we all want to go. I think you probably know which way we all want to go too.
And Stu, consider the fact that we do have some specific experience up here in case that's needed.
Roger copy.
I'll tell you one thing I don't want to get in that part of the Pacific.
Hey Stu. As far as the temperature is concerned, they might bring along some - on the recovery. They might bring along some fuzzy knickers. Ours are pretty thin up here.
Alright, copy that, Rusty.
Apollo 9 Houston we've got about two minutes in this nice long pass. We'll be uplinking a state vector once we get you in Texas acquisition. I've got a nav check. You can either copy it now or there
Oh, we've got a piece of paper here. Stu.
Okay reading the nav check 212:40:00, minus 3282 plus 11997 2127.
Okay. 212:40:00 minus 3282 plus 11997 2127.
That's affirmative.
And Apollo 9, Houston.
Roger. Go.
Roger. I guess, just to close the loop on our discussion here, we'll have the ship at 152-1, if and when you come down there. So I just thought I might toss that in, in case you're wanting it.
Yes. Will it have the 350 pound cake on it?
Yes, it will have a 350 pound cake on it. At least that's the word I have.
Okay. Great!
And we'll lose you here in about 10 seconds and have you through Texas around 41.
Roger did you say you've got the state vector in?
Oh, negative. I said we're going to uplink the state vector at Texas acquisition and I've just given you the Nav check now.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston through Texas.
Roger, Houston.
And if you will give us P00 and Accept we'll uplink your state vector and I'd like to ask you a question about P22.
Okay
Okay, Dave, what we're thinking of here is on this uplink into the CSM slot and leaving the vector as is in the LM slot. And then prior to P22, shoving the vector from the LM into the CSM and doing a P22 on it to see how it can bring in the state vector rather than starting the P22 with a good vector.
Okay I think that's probably a pretty good idea.
By Jove! I get one up and then okay. So this vector we're uplinking now, we'll not Verb 66 it. It will be in the CSM slot.
Are you still with us Stu?
Roger, we got you through Texas here now. This will be a nice long pass.
Okay, you just faded. I guess then what we want to do just prior to P22 is do a Verb 47.
That's affirmative. Verb 47 back over into the CSM slot and then let's see how the P22 does. Then we'll give you a good vector in both slots after the end of it.
Sounds like a fine idea. How did those work out yesterday that I ran?
You're fading way out on me, Dave.
I say how did it work out yesterday?
Okay, we're breaking up here too.
I say again, how did the state vector updates work out yesterday?
Okay, I don't really have that info Dave. I wasn't here and I haven't talked to anybody that's got a good handle on how they went. I read through the transcripts, and it looked like it went well. But I can't answer your questions specifically. We'll get an answer for you though.
Oh don't worry about it, I was just curious. We can pick it up post flight. No sweat.
Okay. And Apollo 9 we are through with the uplink and we have not transferred it to the LM slot. The computer is yours.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go, Houston.
Okay, just to clarify this, I will have the exact times for you later. But talking of this P22 Nav update, here - we'll - when you do this Verb 47 we'll have that over a site somewhere. So as soon as you do that we will then uplink a good vector into the LM slot. That way we won't leave you at any time without a good vector.
You don't think we can get our vector update properly with P22? Come on.
Listen, I'm with you, Stu. Update us a good one.
Well, now, Dave it's just your question there. Like we believe you can use that P37 but we'll still send your block data.
Oh, I was just kidding you. I'll tell you what. We'll have contest to see whose state vector is the best after P22, okay?
Hey, I think that's a good lick.
I think I know who will win.
And Apollo 9, I have about three more targets here we'd like photographed. One of them is coming up in about 7 or 8 minutes. If you can't make it, why no sweat.
Go ahead.
Okay, the first one: 212 plus 04 plus 16, four frames, 7-second intervals, zero degrees. This is of Morocco for geology.
Did you get that? It sounded like I faded out.
Say again
Roger did you get the first update? It sounded to me like I faded out on you.
No, we've got it.
Oh, Okay. The second one is geolo - well, the time 212:10:36, 4 frames, 6-second exposure intervals, zero degrees. And these are the old Tibetsi mountains here in Chad. And you are going to come over them this time.
Okay.
And our third one is 212 plus 16 plus 11, 7 pictures, 19-second interval, zero degrees and this is with Ethiopia Rift Valley - study on the geology there. And the last one is 212 plus 19 plus 07, three pictures, 8-second intervals, zero degrees, and this is geology and this is of Somalia.
And that's all the updates I have now.
Okay, thank you.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston. If you read, we'll see you over Carnarvon at 34.
Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon.
Good morning
Roger.
How are they making out on the recovery position decision?
Okay, they're still working on it, Jim. As far as I can tell, I don't see there's much decision to be made. Just really concentrating on the RCS backup on a couple of revs later is the big planning right now.
Okay. Well, that's kind of the way we felt too. There didn't seem to be much choice between those two sites.
Hey, is that going to be down at 52 1?
I cut you out there. I think you're asking about the ship. And I thought that in a little bit to GO-YES, the Guadalcanal should make 152-1 is the latest word I have here.
Okay, very good.
On that ship, might be - that's just some hasty info, Jim. We'll have a good word for you just as soon as we can and the final decision has been made. But I guess it's touch and go and whether or not the ship actually gets there.
Okay. If none get to us, maybe we can fly to it.
Roger.
We need that cake.
Roger on the cake.
And we're having a time down here on this P22 bit about the state vector. Had a little change of plans. Rather than do as we suggested before, I guess I didn't realize the LM vector would be quite so far out, but we're going to have you do your P22 on the vectors you're carrying now. By then it will have degraded enough the mark should take effect, and also, the first cut at it is we're going to have to change the waiting in this. Right now I don't believe the W Matrix will take the P22 update but we'll zap - we'll give you some numbers. MIT is working this out. They're real anxious to try this too.
Okay. Very good. We'll go into whatever you like.
Okay.
Okay, Jim, I just got the word here. There's no doubt about the ship being at 152-1.
Okay. Very good. Have them bring all the good weather they can with it.
All right or leave all the bad weather where it is, I guess would be the best way.
Yes, that's even better. Have those guys been milling around in those big heavy seas all of this time?
Yes, they sure have. Just a second here, and I'll give you some info. That temperature, air temperature and water I got from you a while ago was from the Guadalcanal and I say it's 1000 Z and at that time the waves were 4 feet, the swells were 14 feet and the ceiling was 2000 feet. Visibility 7 miles wind blowing 26 knots
Wowee I don't think anybody up here is good enough sailor for that.
Roger, and I believe everybody here agrees with that.
But good.
And Apollo 9, Houston. Would you bring up your S-band volume for Honeysuckle please?
Roger.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. Anticipate a caution and warning on your H2 pressure.
Roger, Houston. Pressure one on the H2.
Apollo 9, Houston. I have two more targets for you.
Roger, Houston. Just a minute.
Roger.
Okay. Go ahead, Stu.
Okay. Time, 213 plus 23 plus 54; 3 pictures, 2-second interval shooting 45 degrees north. This is along the Georgia coast and it's for weather. The next one is 213 plus 27 plus 33, three pictures, 20-second interval, 30 degrees south. This is of the Bermuda area, oceanography.
Okay, we got a bunch of Master Alarms here in the middle of that first one on the cryo Press, Stu. Would you let me give you what I got and you can fill me in on the rest? I got 213:23:54. Three pictures, 20-second intervals of the Georgia coast weather. I think you said north or south, but I'm not sure.
Roger, it's 45 degrees north.
Okay 45 degrees north and then another at 213:27:33, three pictures, 20-second intervals, 30 degrees south, Bermuda, oceanography.
That's affirmative.
Okay. I guess you had the right cut there when we were talking about the Georgia coast when you said south I guess I should have said pardon the expression when I said 45 degrees north there
Stu right after you said you guess I had the right cut there, you cut out.
Okay. Hey, we'll see you Mercury at 47.
Roger.
Disregard that. We'll be picking up the Mercury real soon.
And, Apollo 9, delay that fool time I gave you there, we've got you through the Huntsville now.
And, Apollo 9, This is Houston through Mercury, standing by. Have you about nine minutes.
Roger, Houston.
Hello. Houston, Apollo 9. Do you read?
That's affirmative, Apollo 9. we'll have you through Mercury another five minutes.
Okay.
Just in case my kids are listening, tell them I'm growing a big beard for them.
Okay. By Jove!
Seems like you ought to bring that back so they could see it.
Seems that way, doesn't it?
If you think you hear a lot of data down there, man, you ought to be up here.
And, we just got another weather forecast in here, and it's just about the same. 152-1 is looking a little better. In fact the height of the swells is going down. Winds light and variable and scattered clouds. 10 miles vis, 2 to 3 foot waves.
That's not bad?
Get the swelling down.
Yes. Well, on the last several hours, they've gone from 6 to 8 to 6. So they're going in the right direction.
That's nice.
Who do we have out there measuring them?
Well, I don't know if we've got anybody specifically on that site yet or not, Jim.
Okay. I thought maybe we had one of the destroyers down there.
Say again, Jim.
I thought maybe we had a destroyer down there.
We've got a bunch of ships out in there. Let me find out if - the closest point they're getting their data from there.
And along with the weather forecast, the 151 looked just the same. No change in it, it's still looking pretty grim, it will pretty well determine how the decision is going.
Okay.
And we're about LOS Mercury. We'll see you Redstone in about 4 minutes.
All right, Houston. We'll be waiting here for you. Waiting for those golden tones.
Okay, fine.
Hey, Speaking of golden tones, where is old golden throat these days?
I haven't seen old golden throat since I lost myself in this hole over here.
Alrighty.
See you, Houston.
Apollo 9, Houston through Redstone. How do you read?
Loud and clear. Go ahead.
Roger. I just wanted to tag up on the weather info. We don't have a specific ship at 152-1. Guadalcanal is probably heading that way shortly, but it just comes from other ships all in the area, that's radioed into Miami. I'm having a look. See how close a ship they have got to that area.
Okay. I just thought maybe we had one of our destroyers down there, just sitting there with baited breath, waiting for us, but if not, thank you.
Roger.
You don't have to press on any farther with it, Stu.
Okay. Just for your info, the Guadalcanal is 16 hours from 152-1. It's also 18 hours. 151 1. It's been covering the 137 dash 1 recovery area, So it's 16 hours out of 152-1, Plenty of time to be there.
Okay, fine.
And have...
running around in circles.
Roger.
Okay.
And Dave asked the question about the tracking yesterday. The only thing that we checked in with MIT - the only thing they say is the tracking went well. They are going to take a while to analyze the data and so forth.
Okay. No problem, I was just a little curious.
Roger. Understand. That is about all I can tell you now.
Okay. Well, we will see if we can't do it right again today.
Today, with this procedure, you will be able to get a first hack at it, see how it goes.
Yes. It'll be very interesting.
And I have the procedure that you will use to put in your factors in your W matrix and I could give you those anytime.
Okay. Can you stand by just one?
Roger. Lots of time; I just thought if you wanted to take them now or anytime later.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go ahead, Apollo 9.
Okay, go ahead with your procedures for the P22. I'm ready to copy.
Okay. Before and after you do P22, do a Verb 83 so we can get comparisons before and after.
Okay.
Roger. Now we are going to load into the W matrix, and what the optical loads will do for you is give you a 10,000 foot and 10 feet per second. And this is what we want is a Verb 24, Noun 01 enter, 2000 and 4 enter, 137 enter, 762 enter.
Okay. Understand the W Matrix at 10,000 and 10, with a Verb 24, Noun 1 enter, 2004 enter, 137 enter, and 762 enter.
Roger.
And a Verb 83 before and after.
Roger. We'll get the Verb 83 before and after.
Okay. Have fun.
Okay. We will also reset the 121 alarm and then set it afterwards. Okay?
Yes, real good. And you still have the procedure you used yesterday, Dave?
Yes, I've got it. Thank you.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go ahead, Apollo 9.
Hey, on the night pass before the landmark tracking, after we get through with the COAS calibration, how about another P52 to REFSMMAT to get the platform all tweaked up? Okay?
Roger. That sounds real good.
Okay.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. You have a Go all the way to 152 dash 1
Roger. Go to 152 dash 1. Very good.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Houston, 9. Go.
Okay, Dave. I just want to verify there again that we will do the P22 to the CSM vector that you have now, and that Verb 47 we will not do prior to P22.
Roger. We understand that.
Okay.
You want us to do mode 66 now, or you just want to leave the other one in there?
We are going to uplink you a good one before we start. I guess that's probably your choice.
Just a second; Let's see what Guidance has to say about that.
Okay, Apollo 9. Guidance said the same thing I did: your choice.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Houston, 9; Go.
Roger. We have made it official now. It will be 152 dash 1 and the time for ignition on my mark will be 27 hours and four minutes.
MARK
Okay. We got that.
Okay.
Looks like it's 240:30:09.
Well, that's pretty close. It's really 08.
By George! I knew we'd miss something.
You did good work.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. We're showing Quad Charlie is approaching the switch-over point there, and if it switches over, we would like you to go back and use BD roll and disable AC roll. Over.
Okay. We'll keep an eye on it. We will go to BD roll, and you still want us to use the BC quads, right?
That is affirmative.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon. And I have an S065 PAD for you.
Roger. Stand by just one.
Roger
Houston, Apollo 9.
Houston. Go.
We tried taking a couple of photographs through the sextant here, and we took five of them. I don't know how they are going to come out, but we just thought we'd advise you.
Okay. Real good.
Okay, Houston. Go ahead with the S065 PAD
Okay. Inertial angles, 18000 26200; yaw, all zips; 214:55:26, 216:10:00. You will be orb-rate and your Victor through Zulu are the same as yesterday. First sight is Wilmington at 215:00:26 20 03. Over.
Roger. 18000, 26200, all zips, 214:55:26. 216:10:00 orb-rate. Wilmington, 215:00:26 20 03.
Roger. Your readback is correct.
And, Apollo 9, Houston. I have about seven targets of opportunity here. That'll take care of it for the day, I think.
Okay. Just a minute.
Okay, Houston. Go ahead and give us the time first.
Roger. 214:51:30, seven frames, 26 seconds, on track; it's Mexico, geology. At time, 214:54:46, three frames, 24 seconds, It's north 60 degrees, Rocky Mountains, geology. At time 214:56:17, three frames, 22 - second interval, south 30 degrees, College Station, Texas, weather. At time 215:21:05, four frames, 20 seconds, north 45 degrees, Gulf of Guinea, weather. At time 216:31:06, four frames, eight seconds, on track, high plains, Lubbock, Texas, geology. At time 216:43:06, 18 frames, 20 seconds, on track, that's BOMEX, weather. 217:02:12, 9 frames, 20 seconds, north 60 degrees, Cape Fria, southwest Africa, weather. And that ought to do it for the day.
Okay. Just a minute.
And we'll have S-band volume up at 19.
Roger. S - band up at 19.
Okay. 214:51:30, seven frames, 26 seconds, on track, Mexico, geology. At time, 214:54:46, three frames, 24 seconds, north 60 degrees, Rocky Mountains, geology. 214:56:17, three frames, 22 seconds, south 30 degrees, College Station, weather. 215:21:05, four frames, 20 seconds, north 45 degrees, Gulf of Guinea, weather. At time 216:31:06, four frames, eight seconds, on track, Lubbock, geology. 216:43:06, 18 frames, 20 seconds, on track, I've got BOMEX, weather. 217:02:12, 9 frames, 20 seconds, north 60 degrees, Cape somebody or the other, and weather.
Roger. And that BOMEX weather is on track.
Okay.
And that's Cape Fria, F-R-I-A, in Africa.
Okay. Fine.
Apollo 9, Houston. One minute LOS; HI. 39.
Apollo 9, Houston through Hawaii.
Roger. This is Apollo 9. Go.
Roger. Will have you now all the way up until about 10 minutes after the hour.
Oh; very good.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
Roger. Could you brief me on what we are going to do with the S065 on the next pass?
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead. Houston, 9.
Okay. On the S065, there will be taken some - about seven pictures over the US, about 40 of them over the BOMEX area, and then we will pitch up and empty the cameras on the horizon. We will pass up the angles and this good deal stuff up to you.
Very well.
Okay. Very good. I was very afraid you might have some film left.
No, We are going to use it all. As a matter of fact, we will run up before we pitch up, I think, on one of the cameras, but we will just use the other cameras on the - out on the horizon.
Okay. Very good.
Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon.
Go ahead. Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger. We'd like to get a little more information on Quad Delta switchover; so if you could, use quads Charlie Delta for attitude control, right bravo Charlie.
Okay. You want us to go with Charlie Delta now?
Affirmative. Charlie Delta for attitude control, continue with Bravo Delta rule.
Okay; check. Here it is: Baker Delta 4 roll.
Roger. Baker Delta for role when you switch over.
Wait, a second, now. Do you want me to stay in Bravo Charlie now or do you want me to go to Charlie Delta now?
Roger. We'd like to go to Charlie Delta now for attitude control. And then when you switch over, go to BD for roll.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston. I have two S065 updates for you.
Okay. Stand by just one.
Okay. Go.
Roger. 18000 27470, all zips; 216:23:00, 216:10:00. It'll be Orb-Rate. First site: southwest US, 216:27:15 20 15. Second site: GA, 216:34:40 20 07. third site: BOMEX, 216:40:43 20 33.
Houston, are you there?
Roger. Go.
Okay. Ready for read back?
Affirmative.
Okay. 18000 27400, all zips, 216:23:00, 216:10:00, orb-rate; southwest US, 216:27:15 20 15; Georgia, 216:34:40 20 07; BOMEX, 216:40:43 20 33.
Roger, Houston. Let's verify your pitch inertial angle, 274.70.
Roger, 274.70.
Okay. And now for this deplete in the film there. What we want are some pictures of the horizon to see if we can get these different shades of blue that were observed in the Gemini program, and I'll give you some orb-rate angles. I guess as soon as you finish up the last S065, just whip around in the Orb-Rate ball at these angles. I'll give you the time, Then you can deplete the film as soon as you get to the attitude.
Okay. Go.
Okay. Your Orb-Rate ball angles will be 180.27 - belay that. Pitch will be 25.7; yaw, zero. Your time will be 217:03:00. and S-band band volume up for Honeysuckle.
Okay. You want me to read it back?
Your site there will just be the horizon. Deplete film and 10 second intervals.
Okay. Ready, Houston?
Affirmative. Go.
Okay. For the film depletion, we use orbit rate angles, pitch or roll will be 180.0, pitch 025.7, and yaw 000. The time will be 7:03:00. We put the cameras on horizon, take pictures at 10-second intervals until the film is all gone.
Roger, and Jim were kind of short there. You'll probably be going into darkness right away, so as soon as you get the attitude, just go ahead and start taking the pictures.
Okay. We'll zip right up there.
And I can give you some inertial angles if you want to check your orb-rate and things.
Okay. Fine. Go ahead.
Roger. Inertial angles will be 180.00, 169.70, and yaw, zero.
Apollo 9, Houston. I think we have good two way lock, now.
Okay, Ron. I get the 180 but I didn't get the pitch.
Okay. The pitch will be 169.70 and yaw, zero.
Okay. The inertial angles are 180.0., 169.7., and 00000.
Roger. And those inertial angles will be good at 217 03 00.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston. Approaching LOS. Possibility, no voice, Honeysuckle 01; if not, Hawaii at 13.
Okay. Understand you might get us at Honeysuckle and you may not, and Hawaii at 13.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 9. what's the first gyro torquing angle?
Apollo 9, Houston. Say again.
Apollo 9, Houston through Huntsville.
Apollo 9, Houston through Huntsville.
Apollo 9, Houston
Apollo 9, this is Huntsville. Over.
Hello there, Huntsville. This is Apollo 9. How are you today?
Just fine, Apollo 9. Our HF link through Houston is out at this time. Could I take any message for relay once we get these links back in?
I don't believe so. Tell them we're preparing to do S065, and everything else is okay.
Roger; will do.
Huntsville, how are you doing down there?
Apollo 9, Huntsville. We're doing fine now, other than our comm at times is pretty bad here on the HF link.
We certainly appreciate all the help you guys have given us during the flight.
Roger; thank you.
Okay. Get some of that good sun for us, will you?
Roger. We have down pretty close to the equator. It's pretty warm.
Yes, I know. I wish we had some of it up here.
Well, you should be closer to it.
I hadn't thought about it that way.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 9.
Roger. I'll take your torquing angles now if you want to.
Roger. Stand by.
Okay.
Okay. GET: some of this is Okay. 215:40:00, plus 00134, minus 00017, minus 00105.
Apollo 9, Houston. Roger. We copy.
Okay.
And I think I left you with the idea that the depletion on that S065 was pointed right at the horizon. Actually, the camera should be pointed 15 degrees below the horizon.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Roger. Go.
Roger. We had a little problem there in semantics with the scientists. Your orb rate pitch angle for the depletion thing is really 040.7. The cameras are pointing at the horizon, and your inertial pitch angle will be 184.7.
Roger. Orb-Rate, 040.7; inertial, 184.7.
Roger.
Okay
Apollo 9, Houston. One minute LOS; Ascension at 51.
Apollo 9, Houston, 1 minute LOS, Ascension at 51.
Roger. Okay, Houston. We are busily snapping pictures for you.
Real good.
The States were really clear that time; we ought to really have some nice ones.
Okay, that's what we like to hear.
Trouble is, we're supposed to be taking pictures of the weather out here, and the ocean is clear as a bell.
Well, oceanographers will be happy, then.
Yes, just as long as we have the cameras pointing down, we're pleasing somebody.
Okay.
Yes, this is one coming up here on the - to the south of those.
Look at the little white stuff going around you.
Two burns and two turns..
That's going to be an interesting strip of weather film, though.
Apollo 9, Houston through ascension. Standing by.
Roger.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Excuse me, I think I cut you out. Say again.
That's all right. You're pitching out, but we got it.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. It looks like we are going to get a pretty good tracking target on the ascent stage this evening. It's - the closest point of approach will be 222 hours and about 41 minutes. It's about an hour into your rest. There, but we plan to let you sleep an hour in the morning and kind of wonder what you thought about this.
Sure. We'd like to track it.
Okay. Real good. It looks like we'll go ahead and work it into the Flight Plan there and update you a couple of state vectors. Both the CSM and the LM. Range will be out about 690 miles, and we'll give you some gimbal angles to point the optics out of. We'll take a few marks, and then we'll make a vector compare on it.
Great.
Very good.
And we are tracking the ascent stage by a C-band radar and skin track, so that's where we are getting our vector.
Okay. How did that ascent stage hold up after we got out of it?
Beautiful. The commander's bus went down in about seven hours, I think.
Oh, By the way, the lighting looks like it's going to be about perfect for this tracking thing, too
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston
Go ahead.
Roger it looks like when you finish your landmark tracking there, what we plan to do is set you up in a PTC mode, and we'll update the stuff for you here later on. But just keep it in the PTC mode, then you can go ahead and get kind of squared away in there. We'll stay in PTC. Until we start on the tracking of the limb.
Okay. We can get set ourselves up in 30 to 40 degree deadband hold to keep it out of gimbal lock, And that's what you want.
No. We really want the data on the PTC with the DAP driving it so we can get an idea on the fuel and pressure operations, and what have you.
Okay. What kind of pitch on your deadband are you looking for?
Roger. It'll be 20 degrees.
I think so, but we will get you over Tananarive, if not there, Carnarvon.
Okay. How about checking into that, Will you, please?
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon, I have a landmark tracking update.
OK, Houston. We'll be ready for the landmark tracking update in a minute. But before you send us that data, be advised that we went into the darkness taking a picture of the dark horizon rather than the sunlit horizon; our plan is to continue around and finish up by taking picture of the sunrise, if that's OK with you, period. Now, go ahead with your update.
Okay. That's fine with us.
And we're ready to copy the update.
Okay. Update follows. Landmark ID: 005, 217:59:15 00; on down to TCA time, 218:03:13 00; north 30 miles. Next one: ID: 065, 218:10:38 00; TCA time, 218:14:05 00 and is north 30 miles. Over. That's a mess.
Okay. 005, 217:59:15 00, 218:03:13 00, 10 miles north. 065, 218:10:38 00, 218:14:05 00, north 30 miles.
Apollo 9, Houston. Your readback correct.
Apollo 9, Houston. Can you give us P00 and Accept there shortly for a state vector uplink?
Roger. As soon as we torque these angles, you can probably copy them down now.
Roger. We have them.
Okay. We'll be torquing at 217:25:30.
Roger.
Houston, 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
Did you want the numbers from the COAS calibration now, or do you just want them recorded for later?
If you have them, then go ahead and get them.
Okay. I can give you - You've got POO and Accept now, by the way
Roger.
I can give you the ones I did on the rendezvous day, and then I did two today for repeatability if you want to copy them down.
Roger. Go.
Okay. The first one was on day 5: 35974 57167.
Roger. Copy.
Okay. And here are the two for today: 35981 57239, 35977 57296.
Roger. We copy.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. If you can get it in there prior to P22, we'd like you to do a Verb 83 and copy down R, R dot, and Theta; And then also hit a Verb 83 after you've completed P22.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Go.
One other question: When you get around to having us track the ascent stage, are you going to do anything on the W matrix?
Roger. Standby.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Houston, 9. Go.
Roger. The computer is yours. You have a good state vector of the LM slot and a deteriorated one in the CSM slot.
Okay. We'll plan to use the CSM slot for the updating on landmark tracking, And then we'll take a look after that.
Roger. And we're still ginning up the procedure for that. For that tracking thing. We'll let you know on the W matrix.
Okay; very well.
Apollo 9, Houston. Will see you at Guam at 36.
Roger, Guam 36.
Apollo 9, Houston. Standing by through Hawaii.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 9. We are coming around to tracking attitude. And be advised we took some pictures of the sunrise. We only had two cameras running when we started and 1 ran out after about 3 or 4 frames, So we finished up with the other camera.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston. Check your gimbal there.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 9. Thank you.
Apollo 9, Houston. Just a little reminder on that W Matrix Update.
Go ahead with your reminder.
Okay. To update the W matrix, change it to 10,000 feet and 10 feet per second; that we talked over this morning.
Roger. That's in work.
Okay. Good.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
Roger. There's a little low deck of clouds over the first landmark, so we will have to try another one.
Okay. Can't get them all, I guess.
Everything else looks pretty good inland, but there is a little low deck of stratus out there.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 9, Houston. About 2 minutes LOS, and I have your PTC procedures, and I will give them as Flight Plan updates.
Okay. Ready to copy your PTC updates.
Roger. Perform CMP, page 3-17, 4 plus 0.1 degrees per second. Your initial attitude: roll, zero; pitch, 231.7; yaw, zero.
Okay. Is that it, Ron?
Negative. Do step seven at 218 plus 35 plus 00; at 218 plus 40 plus 00, change DAP deadband 2 plus or minus 10 degrees. I think you have that procedure on page about 327, your CMP checklist.
Right.
Anything else?
Roger. Just about every Rev thereafter, we are going to want to try a different deadband. We will try to get 20 degrees and then 25 degrees. We will give you a call on those.
Okay. Understand to perform - The procedure then is to perform the CMP 317 for plus 0.1 degrees per second. In attitude 231.7, 0. Do Step 7 at 218:35:00; and 218:35:00; and 218:40:00, change the DAP deadband to plus or minus 10 degrees.
Affirmative. And you will be kind of on your own. Now you can do any housekeeping things you want to do and we will update you for the tracking procedure here a little later on.
Roger. Stand by for some where we're gonna put all this stuff?
Apollo 9, Houston Ascension. Standing by.
Roger.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Hey, Houston, 9.
Apollo 9. Go.
Hey, I guess that data isn't going to be much good to you on landmark tracking; There were clouds down there, and I marked at a wrong target.
That ought to give us a pretty good error, anyhow,
Yes, it ought to really give you a good error.
Okay.
Took a Stratus back there - and the prime one - There was one that looked like the prime one, and just missed it.
You may have to break the spaceflight, I guess.
Yes, I can give you latitude and longitude of a good one.
Okay. Let's use that one.
Okay. Stand by.
Is this the one you tracked?
Roger. Stand by and I'll give you latitude and longitude; Maybe you can put it together.
Okay. That'll help us.
Apollo 9, Houston. 30 seconds LOS; Tananarive 44; if not there, Carnarvon 59.
Roger. Tananarive 44, Carnarvon on 59.
Apollo 9, Houston. Carnarvon standing by.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger. Loud and clear, Jim.
Houston, 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
Okay. Let me give you the latitude and longitude of the point that we marked on our last pass, and maybe you can make some good out of the data you got. Okay?
Hey, very fine; We can use it.
Okay. I'm sure you can figure out what the point is when I give you the numbers. It's latitude is 19.815, longitude is 73.416.
Roger. 19.815. and 73.416.
Roger. And it's on the western tip of Haiti, there.
Roger.
And, surprisingly enough, the 0689 numbers that came up out of the computer were pretty close
Well, amazing! Real good. Thank you.
Yes, sort of like it identified as unknown landmark and then made it known, and figured out where it was; It did a pretty good job.
Apollo 9, Houston through Guam.
Roger, Houston.
Roger, Dave your best admirer and two little ones are watching you whip across the world here, now.
Say again
I say your best admirer and two little ones are watching you whip across the world.
Oh, very good. Say hello to them for me.
You're saying it.
As a matter of fact tell them I'll be there for Chow in a couple of days.
She's nodding.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
For your information, right now, we are demonstrating how to take out and remove the centre couch at 0G in order to fill, I guess, one of the last DTO'S.
Real fine. Any problems at all with it?
Oh no; It's real easy. As a matter of fact, it's easier than it is down there.
That's what we were hoping.
We'll have some movies if Cecil B. McDivitt and this other fellow here can come out with the right production scenes.
Mighty fine.
What we really need are a couple of good editors.
That's for sure, probably.
9, Houston. PTC is looking real good so far. We'll see what happens when you come up perigee here.
Okay. Let us know when you want us to change deadbands.
Will do
Apollo 9, Houston. Hawaii at 27.
Roger. Hawaii at 27.
Apollo 9, Houston. I can give you the times to change DAP deadbands now.
Say again.
Roger. I can give you the times to change your DAP deadband.
Okay. You're coming through clear, now. Go ahead.
Roger. At 220 plus 10 plus 00, change DAP deadband to 20 degrees.
Roger. Understand. 220:10:00, DAP deadband to 20 degrees.
Roger. And at 221 plus 45 plus 00, change deadband to 25 degrees.
Roger. 221:45:00, deadband to 25 degrees.
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston. I'd like to talk a bit about your cryo plan for tonight.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. It's the same as last night, except your H2 tank pressure can go down to 180 to 200, and then we'll stir tank one fans tonight.
Okay. H2 tank pressure down to 160 or 200, and turn on tank one fan tonight.
Roger. Otherwise, it's the same as last night.
Okay. And we'll give a report when we get everything done.
OK
Apollo 9, Houston. Tananarive at 21.
Roger. TAN at 21.
Apollo 9, Houston through Tananarive.
Apollo 9, Houston through Tananarive.
Go ahead. Houston, Apollo 9.
Roger. Do you read well enough for a Flight Plan update?
Roger. I believe so.
Roger. When you are ready.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 9, Houston. When you are ready, I will go with Flight Plan update.
Roger, Houston. Go ahead with the Flight Plan update.
Roger. 220 plus 48, block data; 221 plus 05, update state vectors; 222 plus 25, maneuver to ascent stage track attitude; 222 plus 50, power down IMU and SCS, terminate Batt A charge, waste water dump to 35 percent. I say again, 35 percent. Begin rest period. Over.
Okay. How do you read Apollo 9, Houston?
Roger. Pretty good now.
We missed where you said 220:48. Would you say that one again, please?
I'll send you block data.
Okay. 220:48, block data; 221:05, update state vectors; 222:25, maneuver to ascent stage track attitude; 222:50, power down IMU and SCS, terminate Batt A charge, waste water dump to 35 percent. Begin rest period. Over.
Roger. Your readback correct.
Houston, Apollo 9. what's the get-up time in the morning?
Roger. Your normal time on the Flight Plan was 232 plus 20, and we are thinking of making it 233 plus 35 or 233 plus 50. That's about seven and a half hours prior to Retro.
Roger understand it will be 233:35.
Affirmative.
Apollo 9, Houston through Guam.
Houston, Apollo 9. Go.
Roger. I'll take your block data over Hawaii here. I'd like to talk over the P20 procedures now, if you want to copy.
Roger. Let me get a pencil.
Okay. Go ahead, Ron.
Okay. I'll give you the procedures about six - about six steps - and then I'll give you the dope on the ascent stage relative motion.
Roger. Ready to copy.
Okay. The first step is roll spacecraft to blank angle; I'll get that to you in a minute. Second one: select normal P20 procedures with auto maneuvers starting CMP page 4-1. Mark as long as desired at one-minute intervals, and update LM state vector. Time of closest approach, 222 plus one - belay that - I'll start again: 222 plus 41 plus 46. You can call P20 anytime prior to closest approach, but be careful of middle gimbal angle on Verb 50 Noun 18. If you call it too early, that middle gimbal angle may be greater than 60 degrees.
Roger
And your current W matrix initialization is okay. And basically, you can call P20 at 12 plus 35 plus 30, and range of about 1,000 miles at that time.
Okay.
Okay. Your initial role angle will be 345.6.
Okay. You ready for readback?
Okay. Go.
Okay. The roll angle for initial acquisition, 345.6, with an auto maneuver in P20 - normal P20 - mark at one minute intervals; time of closest approach 222:13:46; and P28 time prior to closest approach. We'll keep an eye on the middle gimbal angle. W matrix is okay, and the range is 1,000 miles at 222.
Apollo 9, Houston. Roger. Your readback is correct.
Okay. We'll give it a whirl.
Okay. I've got some more dope here at your point of closest approach, on it.
Yes, I was just going to ask you how close and that sort of thing.
Okay. Do you read me now - still?
Roger. Go.
Okay. The range will be 652 nautical miles, R-dot 32; CSM will be trailing 603 miles. You will be below 272 miles, and you'll be 117 miles to the right.
Okay. Understand. Closest approach. 652 miles, R-dot equals 32 is what I heard; CSM trailing 603 miles, below 272, to the right 117.
Roger. Your LM HA is 3741.7 by 127.8.
Roger. 3741.7 by 127.8
Hey, Ron, say again the R-dot at closest approach.
Roger. R-dot is 32 feet per second.
Okay. 32 feet per second.
It's a pretty slow pass through here also. Looks like you'll have about 10 to 15 minutes of tracking there.
Okay. Say again what you said just before the 10 to 15 minutes of tracking.
It goes pretty slow across the field of view.
Okay. Does it go right to left or left to right or what?
It will be going left to right.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Stand by one.
Okay. We are ready to copy the block data.
I was afraid of that. I don't quite have it yet. Request P00 and Accept.
P00 and Accept we got.
Very well, And you won't quite have a Pegasus up there today. It's going to look like about a fourth magnitude star, we think, and my interpretation of the relative motion plot was wrong. The LM is going to be moving from your right to left, so the CSM will be yawing to the left.
Okay. Roger. Understand. Right to left and will be yawing to the left.
Affirmative.
Hey, when we get back, we'll have to talk about PTC and where we stopped it. We stopped it a couple of times now, and we'll get with you and get that all squared away. We have got the time.
Okay. Very fine. No problem.
9, Houston. I have a Nav check. I can send up to you. This is an LM Nav check.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. Time 222:00:00, plus 0252, plus 11936 0228. Over.
We understand. 222:00:00, plus 0252, plus 11936 and 0228.
Roger. That is really at 3 000, 22.8, but the DSKY doesn't have room for it - or the PAD doesn't.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
Okay. There goes your uplink again. Your uplink was hung up there for a minute.
Apollo 9, Houston. We've got a bit of in and out of keyhole there in Hawaii. If we don't quite get it, we'll finish it at Redstone. Redstone AOS is at 09.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. We had a couple of lines wrong there due to keyhole, so we'll line-by-line the CSM, then go straight up with the LM state vector.
Okay.
Apollo 9, Houston. The computer is yours.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger.
9, Houston. How's your eyeball today?
Oh, it's pretty good.
We'll find that out about.
We are counting on you.
I hope
Dave is telling me that maybe the tracking light is back on.
Yes, Roger.
9, Houston. Super Retro has checked and checked and we are ready for block 22.
Okay. Tell super Retro to shoot.
Roger. 141 Charlie Charlie, plus 174, minus 1620 223:57:43 2834; 142 Charlie Charlie, plus 078, minus 1690 225:32:55 2832; 143 Charlie Charlie, plus 209, plus 1450 227:01:06 3913; 148 Charlie Charlie, minus 258, minus 1620 228:51:08 5825; 145 Alpha Charlie, plus 038, minus 0320 229:13:07 5534; 146 Alpha Charlie, plus 198, minus 0301 230:49:07 4539; 147 2 Alpha, plus 293, minus 0300 232:26:14 3813. Your pitch trim, minus 0.6 yaw, minus 0.94.
OK, Ron. What did we start with? 141 Charlie Charlie?
Affirmative.
Okay. Plus 174, minus 1620 223:57:43 2834; 142 Charlie Charlie, plus 078, minus 1690 225:32:55 2832; 143 Charlie Charlie, plus 209, plus 1450 227:01:06 3913.
Faster.
Are you still with us, Houston?
Affirmative. Faster.
Okay. 144 Charlie. Charlie, minus 258, minus 1620 228:51:08 5825; 145 Alpha Charlie, plus 038, minus 0320 229:13:07 5534; 146 Alpha Charlie, plus 198, minus 0301 230:49:07 4539; 147 2 alpha, plus 293, minus 0300 232:26:14 3813. Pitch trim, minus 0.64; yaw, minus 0.94
Roger. Your readback is correct.
9, Houston.
Apollo 9. Houston through Tananarive.
Hello there, Houston; how are you?
Oh, Roger. Mighty fine. The White Team bids you Sayonara, and they will see you back at the ranch.
Hey, is the big White Director there?
Say again
Very good.
Houston, do you read Apollo 9?
Apollo 9, Houston. Loud and clear. How?
We're reading you. I'd like to thank - we'd all like to thank the White Team for all their efforts.
Roger. We appreciate it.
Tell that Flight Director that we still have that debriefing we've got to get with.
Okay. He copied.
Is that big White Flight Director there?
Affirmative. He's on the loop.
Okay. Tell him we better have that debriefing.
We concur and we will schedule it accordingly.
Tally Ho!
Roger.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. This is Apollo 9.
Roger, just checking here with you. We'll be doing - asking you for your E - memory dump here at about 51.
Okay. Well, we're tracking the LM right now and.
Okay. Understand. How's it going?
Okay. We've got it.
Very good.
Lot of smiles around here.
It's 40 46.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We can let the E memory dump go if you get in a time bind, tracking the ascent stage, there. We would like you to turn Batt A charge off now, though.
Houston, Apollo 9. Say again; I missed that.
OK, Jim. We can let the E memory dump go if you get involved tracking the ascent stage, but we would like you to turn Batt A charge off now.
Okay. Battery A charge is Off now.
Alrighty.
9, Houston. We are watching the marks and they're looking good.
Say again, please.
Roger. We are checking the marks as they come in, and they are looking good.
OK.
Apollo 9, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. When you lose the LM, we'd like you to do a Verb 83 and tell us what range you are at.
Okay. Right now, he's against the Earth background, and Dave can't see him. We've been marking, but we just can't see him right now. Auto Optics has been following him, but no more marks for the last 4 minutes or so.
Okay. Understand.
I can pick him up every once in a while, but not long enough to get out of Auto Optics and take a mark. We'll have to process the last one before we call a Verb 83 up, anyway.
Okay, Dave.
Okay. You've got about two minutes to LOS, if you can do it before then.
Okay. I'm picking him up every once in awhile. Maybe he'll get to a dark background in a little while there I can hold on to him.
Okay. If we lose you here, we'll pick you up in Tananarive.
Yes. Will pick up a Verb 83 as soon as we get through the last mark.
Okay, Dave,
Apollo 9, Houston through Tananarive.
Roger, Houston. How do you read?
I read you loud and clear, and just want you to know we are standing by at Tananarive, and we expect to talk to you in Hawaii at 224:14.
Roger. 224:14. and if we're on there long enough, we'll give you our power down schedule.
Okay. Apollo 9, Houston here. We are reading you a little better. We can go ahead and take some of your power down stuff now, if you have it.
Okay. Ready to copy, Al?
Yes. All set, Rusty.
Okay. Service Module A, B, C, D: 51 54 40 48. Batt C Power, A, B: 369 370 370. Injectors: 5.0, 5.0, Off-Scale High, 5.0, 5.0, 4.9. Two ID'S 3125 6127 8027. Over.
Roger, Rusty. Copy. 51 54 40 48, 369 370 370, 50 50 Off Scale High 50 49, 3125 6227 8027.
Roger. You missed one - 5.0 in the injector. 4.9 was six Delta.
Roger. We copied that.
Okay
And while we have you on the line, did you get a range for LOS on the LM?
Roger. I got the figures for you - times. I didn't get you a good range because we can't run Verb 83 along with P20. But those are the times for the first sightings to the last sightings and the beginning and the end of the marks. Okay?
Okay. We are running out of coverage at Tananarive. I guess we'd better save it for Hawaii. See you there at 14.
Oh, very well.
Houston, Apollo 9.
Apollo 9, Houston here.
Roger. Hello there.
Houston, How do you read Apollo 9?
Apollo 9, Houston reads you loud and clear. How are you doing?
Pretty good. I've got a couple of questions for you.
Okay.
Did you want us to leave inverter 3 on MAIN A and transformer on tonight, like last night?
That is affirmative, Apollo 9.
Okay, we configured that right.
Okay. We've got a question for you: have you switched tanks on quad Charlie yet?
Negative.
Okay. We're reading a little low quantity; we just wondered.
No. unless they've been inadvertently opened sometime during the flight, they should still be closed, and we have not switched them.
Roger, Apollo 9. Houston copies, and you want to give me that LM LOS stuff now?
Okay. Let me give it to you real quick here. The first sighting we had was at 222:25:55. It wasn't good enough to mark on, but we did pick him up occasionally. The first mark was at 222:39:40. The last mark was at 222:45:40. Then we saw him every once in a while until 222:51:43, and that was the last time we had any sightings at all.
Roger, Apollo 9. understand you got your first sighting at 222:25:55. You didn't take a mark. You got your first mark at 222:39:40 and your last one at 222:45:40, and you had him in sight until 222:51:43.
Roger. The times we were not marking, we would only get a visual on him maybe two seconds out of every 30 or 40, so you couldn't really get him lined up to take a mark. But with state vectors you have and with the machinery up there, it really looked pretty good.
Roger Dave. Understand. Would you give us a Verb 66 and shift that state vector over now?
Okay. Give you a Verb 66 now.
And, Houston Apollo 9. we have some information for reentry storage.
Roger. Understand reentry storage go ahead.
Okay. We have the one of the large suits and center seat folded, and the L-shaped AGS underneath the center couch. We have a large pressure suit and all three helmets tied down on the floor between the L-shaped AGS and the lithium hydroxide canisters on the front part of the LEB floor. We're going to have two large bags of trash that will probably be tied down in the Lower Equipment Bay, and we'll give you more on that tomorrow. The rest of the spacecraft will be stowed essentially the same, the one exception being the food. B-1 - Locker B-1, Bravo One, that is in Lower Equipment Bay has just trash in it right now, and it will weigh somewhat less than it did at launch. Lockers L-3 will be full of food. They'll have somewhat less than the food that was in them at launch, but we'll stuff some trash in there and try to at least fill them up. As I mentioned earlier, all the LM data is over in A-1.
Roger. Apollo 9, Houston, copy. Would you give us a Verb 74 right now, Jim?
Roger. Verb 74.
3, 2, 1
Mark
And Houston, that's about all the data I have for Retro. Essentially, the spacecraft is stowed pretty much the same way it was at launch, except for the LM data in A-1. The two pressure system or L-shaped bags - both of them on the floor, and other pressure suit lying crossways in the LEB, just forward of the lithium hydroxide canisters.
Roger. Apollo 9, Houston. Copy all that, and the Gold Team would like to say so long to you; It's been fun working.
Say, Gold Team, we've enjoyed every moment with you, and we'd sure like to thank you for all your help. We'll see you at the big debriefing that Mr Kranz is going to arrange.
Roger. I think everybody's agreeable to that.
Okay. You've got a fine bunch of guys, let me tell you.
