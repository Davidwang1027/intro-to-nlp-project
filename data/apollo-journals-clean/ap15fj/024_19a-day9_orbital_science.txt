Hello, Houston; Apollo 15.
Good morning, Alfredo. This is Houston.
Good morning, Dr. Joe. How are you?
Couldn't be better, Al. How's it going?
Just fine, Joe. You all talked out?
No, sir. Just getting ready to start. And, pleased to have a chance to talk to you.
Very...
I've got all kinds of things for you, Al, when you...
Very good, Joe. Glad to be talking to you.
Okay. I've got all kinds of things for you, which I can start handing it up to you at your convenience, pretty much. We're going to change the Flight Plan around a little bit - primarily, lifting out things because of our getting a somewhat later start than normal, and a couple of other minor modifications. I also have a lot of news to read to you and some other good things you might be interested in. Over.
Okay, Joe. Let's - why don't you give me a couple of minutes here to get some pens and the Flight Plan out and - and in about 5 or 10 minutes or so, I'll have the guys put the headsets on and we'll all listen to the news.
Al, out of curiosity, is everybody awake up there?
Yeah, man.
Good morning, Davy...
Yes, Joe, sure are. We're just in the middle of breakfast.
Hello, Joe. How are you?
Well, I'm fine, D.R.; how are you today?
Morning, Joe.
Oh, we're in great shape. Hey, you sure did a fine job for us down there, Joe. Jim and I'd like to really thank you. That was a superfine job of taking care of everything for us.
I think the superfine job is the two of you; it was just most remarkable. Everybody down here is still floating so high, they're having a hard time getting down to all that data you gave us. And you'll be interested to know that - that we have sitting in front of us, a preliminary report from each EVA of the geology of the area that I would say is more complete than our 90-day preliminary reports which were issued on some of our other landings. It's just most exciting.
Well, it's because you've got the real professional backroom there. Those - those guys really know how to put - put it together. Especially with the way they were coming up with the new ideas while we were on the surface. That was really neat.
And, Dave, I do have to ask you one question. Is there a three-unit segment of deep core stems some place in that Command Module?
Joe, we wouldn't lose sight of that for all the tea in China. That's number 1 priority.
Yes sir. [Long pause.]
Oh, as a matter of fact, Joe, we made a good thorough search of the LM before we let it go. We went from top to bottom to make sure we got everything, and I'm sure we got everything we brought up off the surface, and I'm pretty sure we did - did fairly well cleaning up the surface.
Okay, Dave. Good news; good news. Al, if you're ready, I'll start hitting you with a few things we're interested in knowing from you right away. And then, when we get those, I'll give you the general plan for the day. And I think, in some cases, we'll want to just talk you through some of the changes while you're making your front-side pass. There's no need to feed up all the data in detail to you at the beginning here. My first question: we need from you a configuration of panel 230, particularly - in fact, only really the Mass Spec. switches, could you - call out the settings for the Mass Spec., Experiment switch, Ion Source switch, Multiplier switch and Discriminator switch, please.
Okay, Joe, I'm right there. Experiment is up and On. Ion Source is centered. The Discriminator is Low and the Multiplier is Low.
Okay, thank you. That's - that's what we'd guessed. And, Al, I - I guess the first thing we want - we're going to want you to do today is to start to get ready to go plus-X forward, P20 option 5. We're going to want you to retract the Mass Spec. boom and close the X-ray and Alpha Particle cover.
Okay, Joe. We'll do all that. How about putting it on a - on a time basis for me so I can write it in the Flight Plan.
Okay, real fine. You can start that right now at - just put it in at 192:52, I guess. And also, right after that, list fuel cell purge, H2O dump and LiOH canister change. [Long pause.]
Okay, Joe. Understand. You want us to go ahead into plus-X P20 SIM bay attitude, and pull in the Mass Spec. and the Gamma-ray booms, and, I guess, turn off the Mass - turn the Mass Spec. to stand by.
Al, let me hit you with that last statement again. We want you to retract the Mass Spectrometer boom, but not the Gamma-ray, and close the X-ray and Alpha Particle covers. Retract Mass Spec. boom and close two covers. Over.
Okay, understand. You want us to pull in - to retract the Mass Spec. boom and close the X-ray [and] Alpha covers, then do the fuel cell purge, the water dump and a canister change.
That's affirm.
Okay, Joe. I'll get that in work. [Long pause.]
And one more item. You can start to charge Bat B at your convenience.
Okay. [Pause.]
Okay, and looking downstream here, as soon as you get turned around, and these other good things done, we're going to ask you to open the X-ray and Alpha Particle covers. And for rev 60, the [current] agenda calls for an eat period for you. And Gamma-ray, X-ray and Alpha Particle data being taken during that time. Sounds like you've got your eat period pretty well out of the way.
Yeah, that's right, Joe.
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, Al.
Okay, Joe. While we're maneuvered here to a plus-X forward, how about reading some news to us?
Okay. Sure will. Let me - let me begin with just a note on that water dump. It'll take about 15 minutes to run, and they're interested in your dumping it to close to 10 per cent onboard reading. Over.
Roger, understand. Probably the same as we've been doing before. We dump down to 10 per cent, but not below 10 per cent.
That's correct. And I've got several things to read to you here. I have the official morning Gold Bugle Zeitung report and - that comes from two rows behind me here. And I've also got a telegram for you, Jim. And I have some history - a little bit of history that's been researched for you by the people at Honeysuckle concerning a small problem with a leak on the Endeavour about 200 years ago. And I'll start with whatever you'd like to hear first. [Long pause.]
Okay, Joe. Go ahead.
Okay, let me just start with the morning's news. The weather report in Houston-Galveston area calls for showers and thunder showers through Wednesday. Today's temperatures will be in the lower 70s and upper 80s.
The United States will support Communist China's admission to the United Nations this fall, Secretary of State, William Rogers announced. The U.S. will also fight against expelling the Nationalist Chinese Government on Taiwan. U.S. Steel, the industry pace setter, announced a price hike averaging 8 per cent on virtually all its products and several other companies followed suit, as an aftermath of a new 3-year labor contract. Trainmen won pay increases of nearly a dollar and a half an hour, spread over a 42 months, in a nationwide contract settlement, and called off their crippling strike against ten railroads. The union yielded on the railroad's demands for some work-rule changes, yet to be worked out. Among those viewing Apollo 15 activities, Monday, in the MOCR was artist Robert McCall, designer of the commemorative stamp for Apollo 15. And just an editor's note here: He was also making sketches of the scenes down here as he saw them and he would turn them out almost as fast as the photographer would take pictures. It was most interesting. Turning to the sporting news, Don Wilson pitched a two-hitter and Jesus Alou drove home the winning run and then made a game-saving catch as the Houston Astros downed the Chicago Cubs, 2 to 1. And, apparently, rain is slowing up the Oilers' preparations for the Giants. The Oilers/Giant exhibition game is scheduled for Monday night in the Astrodome. And I've got a - the Monday's baseball scoreboard - which I'll run through quickly for you baseball fans. In the American League: Boston 7, Baltimore 4; New York 7, Cleveland 0; Oakland 2, Kansas City 1; Chicago 7, Minnesota 5; Detroit 11, Washington 7; California 3, Milwaukee 1. Readback.
Disregard...
Roger, Joe. Copied all these off.
Roger. Okay. In the National League: Philadelphia 4, Atlanta 0; Cincinnati 4, New York 2; St. Louis 3, San Diego 1; and Los Angeles 5, San Francisco 4. And Lee Trevino added another thousand bills to his bank roll, Monday, by taking first place with the number - with a 7-under-par, 65, in the Colombus Invitational Pro-Am. Jack Nicklaus and Arnie Palmer teamed last weekend to close in on Trevino in professional golf's money-winning race, though. Nicklaus and Palmer won twenty thousand dollars each when they won the National Team Championship at - I guess Ligonier, Pennsylvania. Trevino leads for the year with a total of nearly two hundred thousand dollars.
And, I'll go over now to - Jim, a special telegram for you which reads, essentially: Mother, Dad, and your brother Charles are proud of you. We were thinking of our trip together on top of Mount Whitney and we are with you in spirit on the Moon. Love, Mother, Dad, and your crew. And I might add, that there - An occasional piece of mail for - for all of you that's starting to - starting to come in to the Manned Spacecraft Center, here. In fact, I think a truck pulled up there yesterday to deliver some of the first.
I'm going to go on, if you're still listening, to read some history that was sent to us by the Honeysuckle people. And the subject is "A Leak on the Endeavour at 62 hundred GET." Following the above incident and the wonder from the Apollo 15 crew whether Captain Cook's Endeavour had ever sprung a leak, staff at Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station has searched the records and come up with the following incident, which may be of interest. Information has been extracted from an old newspaper article and an entry in Captain Cook's log book. "It was 11 pm on June 11, 1770, a clear moonlit night, when His Majesty's Ship, Endeavour, under the command of Captain James Cook, sailed serenely under fully furled sail within the waters of the Great Barrier Reef off Australia's northeast coast. Then disaster struck. The ship had got upon the edge of a reef of coral rocks which lay to the northwest of us, having come in places [sic] run the ship 3 or 4 fathoms and in others about as many feet." And I'm quoting James Cook's diary here. "But about a hundred feet from her starboard side, she, laying with her head to the northeast, were 7, 8, and 10 fathoms." With a grind and a roar, the Endeavour rose in the bow, and came down hard. Empty water casks broke their lashings and lay in a tangle with the rigging on the deck. The captain, clad only in drawers, which I guess is a Constant Wear Garment, rushed on deck. He summoned all hands to the pumps, and ordered all unnecessary stores to be thrown overboard. Such items as iron, and stone ballast from deep in the hold, casks, hoops, stays, oil jars, decayed stores, and then six cannons, which fired 4-point shot. (Probably one cannon to fire long, one cannon to fire short and two to fire for effect.) These, in fact, are the cannons discovered in 1969, off the coast of northeastern Australia by a team from the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Science. And, after restoration, one each was presented by the Australian - to - by the Australian government to the U.S., British, and to New Zealand. The remaining three cannons are in Australia. The original Endeavour was finally freed from the reef by means of oakum and wool, wrapped in a sail, being sunk under the ship and plugged into the hole in hope that it would be sucked into the leak and would close the leak. The experiment was entirely successful and, I quote again, from Cook's diary, "In about a quarter of an hour to our great surprise, the ship was pumped dry and upon letting the pumps stand, she was found to make very little water." Subsequently, the Endeavour arrived at the Australian mainland, the landing place is now called Cooktown, by the way, and after two months the damage had been repaired and the ship returned to England. And that's the end of your history lesson for today. Over.
That's quite an analogy, isn't it.
Quite an analogy, Dave. Certainly is.
Okay, stand by, Joe. [Garble], wow!
Houston, 15. I'm ready to copy the consumables, Joe.
Okay, Alfredo. GET 191 plus 25; RCS total, 47 [per cent]; quad A: 50, [B] 47, [C] 46, [D] 47; H2 tank 1: 56, [2] 53, [3] 42; O2 tank 1: 64, [2] 67, [3] 54.
Rog, understand, Joe. At 191:25, RCS total, 47; quad A: 50, 47, 46, 47; H2 is 56, 53, 42; O2 is 64, 67, 54.
Copy, Al. And I'll be right back.
Okay, Joe. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, this is Houston again.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Al. Let me lay some more words on you concerning your Flight Plan, when you're - you're ready to talk about that.
Roger, Joe. Go ahead.
Okay. You'll be in the configuration plus-X forward, and will be taking Gamma-ray, X-ray and Alpha Particle data, data during rev 60. We want you to do, at 193 plus 45, a P52 option 3. And we're going to add a Map and Pan Camera pass sometime during rev 60. And I'll be coming at you with the necessary data for that. Also...
Roger, Joe; understand.
Okay, Al. Now I guess a - a word about biomed configuration, today. In order to get some very interesting baseline data, medical data on you, Al - and, Jim, for your EVA coming up later - we're requesting that the two of you give us that biomed data today. I think, Dave, you were scheduled for it, but I guess we'd prefer Jim on the line with Al to get baseline data for later. Now, Al, let - let me run through in just some blocks here, [of] the next revs as we see them, and the approximate activities. And then I'll come up with specific data concerning those revs later on, perhaps actually during the revs. On rev 61, we're going to have the UV...
Roger that.
Okay. On rev 61 will be UV photography of the lunar mare. We're coming up on, I guess, an hour of light flash experiments, and it's pretty much dealer's choice between Dave and Jim, who - whichever one of you would like to do that. Rev 62 will be a crew exercise period, science photos, and science visuals. And we'll be taking the Mapping Camera and Laser Altimeter data during rev 62. And it will end with terminator photos. On rev 63, more Mapping Camera, Laser Altimeter, and a burst of the Pan Camera. UV photos and terminator photos again. Rev 64 will be eat period, boom photos, LiOH canister change; and that brings us to about 204 hours, and it'll be time to go to bed again. Over.
Okay, Joe. Understand in the Flight Plan that the object is going to be to get us back to the - to the printed Flight Plan as much as possible.
That's exactly right, Al. And you'll be coming on to it kind of as the day progresses. We're just going to pick up a few quick items that we've missed over the past 2 hours and mainly just lift - lift out other sections, as I understand it. But you'll be back on the Flight Plan shortly.
Okay, Joe. Fine. Thank you.
Rog. And...
And, Joe, let me request that Jim be...
Go ahead, Dave.
I'd like to say that I'd like to have Jim without his sensors on today. That 3 - 4 days in a row is pretty tough with those things on. I think probably, if we get him tonight, you could probably get your data, don't you think?
Stand - stand by, Dave, and I'll - let me double check,
Say, as a matter of fact, Joe, why don't you give Jim and Al both a break today on the sensors, and I'll stick mine on, because I've had them off since we got back yesterday. And then if you want us to have some particular data-gathering periods, why don't we take a look at that starting tonight, huh?
Okay, Dave. That sounds good.
Okay. And concerning the light flash things - Jim and I both saw light flashes while we were on the surface, as a matter of fact.
Okay, copy that, Dave. That's remarkable.
Good ship Endeavour, this is Houston. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. On our downlink data, we see indications of High Gain Antenna yaw fluctuations. Wonder if you could glance over at your onboard indication and see if you see it there as well. And, also we're standing by for crew status reports, when you're ready to give it.
No, we - we see no oscillations up here, Joe.
Okay, thank you.
Al, this is Houston. With a TEI-62 PAD, when you're ready for that. We also have a question. How did the Mass Spec. boom retraction go? And we've got a switch setting for your Mass Spec. when you're ready.
Okay. Jim will be ready to copy a TEI PAD here in a minute. And Mass Spec. boom retracted without a hitch this time, Joe. Sorry I didn't get the time on it, but it was very close to the nominal time, and apparently it didn't hung up this time.
Okay, fine, Al. Thank you. We'd like the - I guess the Mass Spec. placed on Standby, please. And that's the Experiment switch.
Okay. Mass Spec. on Standby. Yeah, that's verified on standby, Joe.
Thank you. [Pause.]
And, Joe, I'm ready to copy that TEI PAD.
Okay, Jim, good morning. We need Accept, and we're going to uplink a new state vector to you.
Okay, Joe. The readback on TEI-62. SPS/G&N; 36310; plus 0.61, plus 0.92; 200:10:34.64; plus 2928.4, plus 0190.3, minus 0043.5; 180, 106, 006; four jets, 12 seconds.
Okay, Jim. Readback correct. And how are you doing this morning?
Fine, Joe. Had a good night's sleep.
Super. [Pause.]
Okay, Joe, I've got a clear status report for you.
Go ahead.
Okay. Longest 9 hours sleep in one period there, Joe, to begin with. And the PRDs are 25024, 08031 and 23175.
Okay, Al, copy that. And assume there was no medication.
That's affirmative.
Okay, thanks, babe. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, you can go back to Block. You have a new state vector and we're standing by to watch your water dump.
Okay, Joe, crank out the water dump. Want to watch one for a change, huh?
Roger, lay it on us.
Hello, Endeavour. This is Houston with a Map Camera photo PAD when you'kre ready.
Stand by one, please, Joe.
Roger.
Houston, 15. Go ahead with your Mapping and Pan Camera photo patchup.
Okay, Al. And I - I forgot to tell you when you're dumping water, you can also go ahead with the urine dump if you need to do that. I just forgot to mention that. The Map Camera photo PADs for rev...
That's okay, we're doing it.
Yeah. For rev 60. T-start, 194:35:05, T-stop, 195:34:50. Image motion setting at T-start: barber pole plus 4; At 195 plus 20 plus 00: barber pole. And a couple of notes on this. Be sure to retract the Gamma-ray boom prior to the start of the camera pass. And be sure to go to 5 degrees deadband in P20 - I'm sorry, Al; that's 5/10ths of a degree deadband in P20 prior to camera pass. And you want to extend the camera and start the Laser Altimeter per the system's checklist, page S/1-38. Over. [Pause.]
Roger, Joe. Understand. Mapping Camera photo PAD: T-start, 194:35:05; T-stop, 195:34:50. Now for the image motion, you want a T-start barber pole plus 4, and at 195:20:00, you want that increased to barber pole. And notes: Retract the Gamma-ray boom before taking the pictures; go to half-degree deadband; and extend the Mapping Camera; and start the Laser Altimeter as per system's checklist S/1-38.
Sounds good, Al. Thank you.
Endeavour, this is Houston with the new O2 heater configuration for you. [Pause.]
Okay, Houston. Go ahead.
Rog, Al. We want O2 Heater in tank 3 to Auto and tanks 1 and 2, Off. Over.
Understand, Joe. You want O2 Heater in tank 3, Auto, and the other two, Off.
That's right, Al. And we want you to proceed with your O2 fuel cell purge listed at 193 plus 58 in the Flightk Plan.
Roger, Joe. We'll get that in work here now.
Al, this is Houston. You can terminate the dump now. And turn the Alpha Particle experiment Off, please. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, Houston. Requesting Auto in the High Gain [Antenna]. And, troops, you may have to delay the P52 we've called out to you, and it's coming up shortly, until about 194 plus 20, to make sure most of the water's out of the way. Over. [Pause.]
Roger, Joe. I'll just go take a look here and see if I can pick up the star okay, I'll go ahead and do the P52.
Okay, Al. And you got the call about the Alpha Particle counter, I hope.
Right. Roger. We got it turned off.
Thank you, sir.
Houston, 15.
Go ahead.
Okay, Joe. I got the gyro torquing angles up, and I'll torque them out on the minute.
Standing by.
I'll get out of your way, Al, so you can get down in here.
Okay.
Al, we no - noted the termination of your fuel cell 3 purge. At your convenience, open the X-ray and the Alpha Particle experiment covers, please, and turn the Alpha Particle back on. Over.
Okay, Joe. We'll be about another 2 or 3 minutes finishing up all the dumps, and then we'll do that.
Okay. Fine. We do want you to wait until all the dumps are completed, and then open the doors and turn Alpha Particle on at your convenience, really.
Roger.
[Garble] this morning.
Yes, Myrtle. I didn't use - I didn't - hadn't used Myrtle this morning. I didn't use Myrtle this morning.
I think that checklist is [garble] 5 minutes and then closed.
Yes, it does.
Yes, that's [garble]. Yes. Yes. [Garble].
Yes. Yes. I didn't use that this morning.
[Garble] Al. [Garble].
That's true.
[Garble].
Yes. You were smart.
Good ship Endeavour, this is Houston. We'll see you on the other side.
Okay, Joe.
Okay, we got...
We stow this in that Jum [?] bag down there? When I took that [garble], Al? Okay.
How about this? Go Manual and Wide. Right, Al? That what you say? Then - then go to Reacq? Just leave it in Manual and Wide until we come around, right?
What?
Manual and Wide. How about the Squelch Enable?
I have the Squelch Enable on.
I'll get it. This is [garble].
Okay.
Okay, all [garble] be done behind here.
You want to - I don't care. Where is the best place for you to be?
Here [garble].
Okay. I'll just stay here in the center.
[Garble].
I know. You [garble] put mine on.
[Garble] launch.
We might have them sorted out by then.
Old Al, he's a gentleman [garble].
No, don't bruise him.
Yes?
[Garble] read that [garble] now?
[Garble] Magic Marker [garble]. Besides, these used to be the guys [garble] all versions [garble] all the cross-subjects of the Command Module. Although [garble] all the stuff [garble].
[Garble] a lot of garbage. [Garble].
[Garble], Jim. [Garble] all garbage [garble].
Yes. [Garble] put the garbage in here all [garble].
I don't...
We do? Shoot, I - I feel great today.
[Garble] gone from one [garble] to the two.
What do I have to do?
Photograph that [garble].
Oh, yes.
I should have brought that LEC hook back. It sure was handy in the LM. Trying to grab stuff with the EV gloves was like work.
[Garble] 5 minutes [garble] did you get them - did you get them back [garble].
You know, Dave, we had probably - we had the worst condition possible for getting up and down that front ladders. That's the problem...
[Garble].
For getting up and down that front ladders. The gear hadn't stroked at all. And it was, you know, practically off the surface. If I didn't have anything, if I could give a good leap, I could make it to the first rung. Most times, while carrying something, I ended pulling myself up with my arms to get to the first rung.
[Garble] the gear didn't stroke [garble].
Didn't stroke at all. In fact, the front pad wasn't even on the surface. No, the pad was loose...
Yes.
...free to rotate, so it wasn't even - it wasn't making a firm contact at all with the surface.
[Garble] sticking to the bottom, to me. I'll tell you, Jim, it sure is a lot easier than that damn [garble].
Oh, yes, particularly, you know, if there is a little time. I - I could transfer the bags up and just leave them on the porch, wait for you to get up there, and you pass them, then I could grab them with that LEC hook.
[Garble] in three times to try it. [Garble] once to transfer the LEC [garble].
Yes.
Try your scissors. You [garble]. Your scissors are over there, on your left of your - O2 Flow, Hi. Help me dump it.
Oh, shit! [Garble] ketchup [garble].
Here's some, Dave. Right here.
Okay. Now [garble].
Want some more?
[Garble].
[Garble].
Cabin pressure's are [garble].
Cabin pressure's are what?
Split at 5.
What? This vent is open [garble].
Myrtle was [garble] and the [garble] valve was just open [garble] back up.
[Garble] your burn's out if you leave your flow valve in normal? [Garble].
Jim, I think this little valve in your Jiminy [?] bag is all clogged up. That's your problem. Because I just tried that, and it works fine - transferred to a new Jiminy [?] bag. [Garble] valve.
Yes, I think my valve is probably a little clogged.
Well, you got to keep it clean.
Yes.
[Garble].
[Garble] I don't think any [garble] in there.
Anyone for chewing gum this morning?
Want some chewing gum, Dave?
What?
Want any chewing gum?
[Garble].
Do you have all the parts there, Al?
They're in here if you need them. [Garble].
Good.
They go on here [garble]. Take a whole piece.
[Garble].
[Garble] stuff like that.
[Garble].
Watch it. This washer over here slipped.
If you had a screwdriver, I think we could push the washer on this side down a little bit, Al. This washer here's slipped up.
Okay. I've got it through now.
You've got it a little apart.
[Garble].
Where is the other part? I got it through the washers. Go ahead. [Garble] be tighter than that.
Man!
I don't see it. Okay. Tightened it up to some extent [garble] this screwdriver. Why don't we try them out.
Tool E fit in this socket over here? It's too big?
Yes?
[Garble].
Okay, I think we got it. O2 Flow, Hi again.
I think you almost got it. You want me to try it ...
Better put some chewing gum on it; maybe some tape. That's what we need. Put some tape around it. That will keep it from backing off.
Guess we ought to check those screens on the - on the hoses, too; they're probably - should be changed this morning.
[Garble] get the vacuum cleaner, pull all the filters out, and we'll [garble]...
Okay.
...Get the vacuum cleaner [garble] off, lay down every bag and [garble] everything before we leave. [Garble] shoes [garble] stow away [garble]. In the mean time, I'll go around and [garble] get it [garble] all the little bags we have and [garble] all the goodies from the LM, put them in that one camera bag [garble] bag, and [garble]. And [garble] check. It would be nice to log all [garble] before we start taking [garble]...
Yes.
...Exactly what we're [garble].
Yes, okay. Okay, Dave. If you hand me the tape. I think this is about as tight as we'll get this.
I can't hear you.
Little pieces of tape.
Tape?
Yes.
How big?
Oh, probably - 6 inches worth. Yes.
Yes.
Dave Scott taught me. Tape everything. Yes, I don't know what we would have done if we hadn't had the tape along. I might have been without comm on the surface.
Okay, I think your seat's fixed.
You know what we can also do, Dave, is wet wipe the MAGs. Might be even better then - wet wipe them - get a towel - damp towel here - Just wipe them off.
Mags?
Yes, rather than vacuuming.
No vacuum [garble] wet wipe [garble] towel [garble].
Procedure says to unstow them, vacuum, and then wet wipe. Yes.
[Garble].
Yes, I was just going [garble] LM Timeline.
I think I would follow the [garble].
Yes.
You know why I vacuum [garble].
Okay.
[Garble].
Can't we use this little square?
Yes. Yes.
Make sure you [garble].
Use those little square jobbies, you mean - we have around. Yes.
And I think vacuuming would be easier to get in the cracks. And I certainly think that dirt will - dirt can get in the cracks [garble]. Maybe wipe the surface clean. [Garble]. Okay. [Garble].
Yes. Okay.
[Garble].
You don't have another bag we can put this - this trash in?
[Garble].
I was wondering if we had another big feed bag that was just about empty - the food locker, we could put this in there. Better than making two transfers.
[Garble].
[Garble] CG
[Garble].
Well, where's the Jett bag? Let's put it in the Jett bag.
We can't use the Jett bag. If we do that you've got to get the [garble].
Okay, okay.
Get your own C [garble].
Okay.
We don't put up with it.
Do you want to take this down with you? Just transfer all the stuff up - out of that bag and into this one here, Al.
Yes.
[Garble]. We got Jett bag in 3 - 310B [garble]. Turn around and look [garble].
[Garble].
No, that's [garble] canister.
Hey, I got a Mapping Camera PAD [garble].
Yes.
[Garble]?
Which one do you want to get in? This one? Okay.
I'll just unplug here.
[Garble].
What?
I got the LM Timeline [garble].
Yes, I have.
[Garble].
Yes.
[Garble] cooled things off, too, huh? Beat his ass, too.
No, I [garble].
Oh, I don't know.
No, I [garble] something.
Daylight. Oh, okay. Sure will. [Garble].
[Garble].
You know, I figure we got almost exactly a 100 hours. As a matter of fact, this ent - this orbit entry, or - Entry Interface, is at - 291:30 - huh - 294:43. It is now 194 and some.
Not as bad as [garble].
Hello, Endeavour. This is Houston. [No answer.]
Hello, Endeavour. This is Houston.
Hello, Houston; Endeavour. Loud and clear.
Roger, Al. I wanted to tell you that, except for a couple of minor changes, you'll shortly be back on the nominal Flight Plan. I do have a Pan Camera photo PAD to be copied into your Flight Plan at 195 plus 00 when you're ready.
All righty. At 195 plus 00, Pan Camera Mode, Standby; Power, On; Stereo, Exposure, Normal. At 195:04:13, Pan Camera Mode, Operate. At 195:14:30, Pan Camera Mode, Standby. Pan Camera Mode, Mono. At 195:18:23, Pan Cam Self Test to Self Test. The talkback should be barber pole for 30 seconds and then gray. And after the talkback is gray, Pan Camera Self Test to Heater. At about 195 plus 21, Pan Camera Power, Off, on a cue from MSFN. At - at 195 plus 34 plus 50, Laser Altimeter, Off; Retract Map Camera; and Close Map Camera Cover, per steps 7 and 8, page S/1-39 in your checklist. Over.
Okay, Houston; understand. And I'll go through the whole thing here for you. At 195, Pan Camera Mode, Standby; Power, On; Stereo and Exposure, Normal. At 195:04:13, Mode to Operate. At 195:14:30, Mode, Standby, and Stereo to Mono. At 195:18:23, Self Test to Self Test, and barber pole for 30 seconds and then Self Test to Heaters. At 195:21:00, Pan Camera Power to Off on your cue. At 195:34:50, Laser Altimeter, Off; Retract the Mapping Camera, and close the covers per steps in checklist S/1-39.
Okay, Al. Right on. And could you verify for us, please, that the Alpha Particle Spectrometer's been turned On and that the X-ray and Alpha Particle covers are Open. Over. [Pause.]
Okay, Joe. The covers are open. X-ray is On, and Alpha Particle coming On now.
Okay, thank you. And, Endeavour; we need Narrow Beam on the High Gain [Antenna], please. [Pause.]
Got it. [Pause.]
Okay, Al. Thank you.
Rog, Joe.
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, Al.
Joe, looking ahead a little bit in the Flight Plan, I see we've got gegenschein coming up on this rev. And I guess my question is do you want me to change the film in the - in the camera now? In other words, have we missed any picture taking with the - the - the Nikon that maybe we want to pick up with that mag before I offload that mag?
Al, I'll have an answer for you in just a minute on that. In the meantime, could you reverify that the covers on the X-ray and Alpha Particle are open, and we're getting some problems on that, and I guess the best thing to do would be - to just go to your checklist, page 1-33, and do that Cover, Open, couple of steps - which is listed "Number 1, Cover, Open"...
Okay, now, Joe. You're right. I don't know - I don't know where we got - got our wires crossed, but the covers were closed and they're now open.
Okay, no problem. Good. [Long pause.]
Al, on your question on the gegenschein experiment, we want you to go ahead and change the mag to Victor, just per the Flight Plan.
Okay, Joe. Thank you.
Hello, Al. This is Houston. [Pause.]
Hello, Houston. This is Al.
Roger, babe. Requesting you - give us a Gainstep on the Gamma experiment up three clicks, please. And we're also wondering what mag you've taken off the Nikon to put mag Victor on. There's some confusion in our minds. I guess we thought Victor was already on there. Over.
Negative. Mag U was on there before, Joe, and I had just taken it off.
Okay, thank you, Al. That helps us. And once again, the Gainstep on the Gamma, up three clicks. And we're showing that now.
You've already got it.
Thank you.
Endeavour, this is Houston. Requesting Auto on the High Gain, please.
Auto it is.
Endeavour...
Mark. 15 seconds to Pan Camera, Off - On, Pan Camera, On. Sorry.
Rog. Rog. Got you, Joe.
Pan Camera, On.
It's On.
Pan Camera to Standby in 30 seconds. [Pause.]
Rog, Joe. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Pan Camera to Standby. [Pause.]
Pan to Mono.
We copy, and thank you, Al. And I've got a UV photo PAD, a big one liner, when you're ready to copy that.
Okay, Joe. Go ahead.
Rog. This is for your PAD located at 196 plus 50. And it is T-start, 196:56:19. [Pause.]
Understand, Joe. UV photo PAD. T-start, 196:56:19.
Right on, Al. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Endeavour. 30 seconds to Self Test. [Pause.]
Rog. [Long pause.]
Al, I gave a bad call. I was 30 seconds premature on that. Stand by.
Okay. [Pause.] Looks like you'll get two Self Tests, Joe. [Long pause.]
Al, that's no problem. We'll take both of them, and I'll cue you for the next.
Okay. I'll give you a whole series of them if you want them. [Pause.]
Negative, Al. [Long pause.]
30 seconds to Self Test.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Mark. Self Test. [Pause.]
Rog.
Houston, 15. Pan Camera is in Heater Mode now.
Thank you, Al. [Long pause.]
Okay, Al, and on the Map Camera, Image Motion to barber pole, please.
Rog.
Hello, Endeavour, this is Houston.
Houston, Endeavour. Go ahead. [Pause.]
Roger, Al. I've got what they tell me is the last change to your Flight Plan to put you back on the nominal.
Okay, Joe; stand by just one.
Okay. No hurry.
Okay; Houston; 15. Go ahead with the Flight Plan update. [Long pause.]
Okay, Al. The first change is at 195 plus 36 in your Flight Plan. And it is "Gamma-ray Boom, Deploy, talkback barber pole for about 2 minutes and 40 seconds, then gray, and then to Off. Center position." Over. [Pause.]
Roger, Joe. Understand. At 195:36:00, "Gamma-ray Beam - Boom, Deploy, talkback barber pole about 2 minutes, 40 seconds, then gray, and switch Off."
Okay, Al. That's good, and the next two items are deletes over at 196 plus 31. And that is, delete...
Okay, go ahead.
...delete "Map Camera/Laser Experiment Covers," et cetera, and delete "Map Cam Track," et cetera, and at 196 plus 37, delete "Laser Altimeter, On." Over. [Pause.]
Roger; understand. At 196:30, delete the 2 lines dealing with the Mapping Camera, and at 196:37 delete the Laser Altimeter function. [Pause.]
Okay, Al, and you're now back on your Flight Plan except for the additional couple of Pan Camera bursts and a Map Camera pass, that you already have copied down. And while I've got you on the line here, I'd like for you to think back yesterday, and I've got a question to ask concerning your suit integrity check. We're trying to go through this and reconstruct exactly what had happened. And I guess what we need is a - a comment about your third suit integrity check. And, that one was the one you did just after the first LM jett had been scrubbed and you went around the back side and did a suit integrity check, and we're wondering if you can recall any of the details of that check for us? Over.
Okay, understand you're concerned about the second suit integrity check we did. The third one was okay. The suits were - held integrity fine, and we had an O2 flow of about .6 to .7. So, I guess you're talking about the second one, huh? [Pause.]
Dave, we're talking about the one you did before the last one, whatever number you call that.
Yes, Dick, that - that was the one we recycled quickly onboard up here, and it was because we had one of the gloves that wasn't fastened on exactly right.
Roger, Al. Map Camera and Laser, Off, please. [Pause.]
Okay, Map Camera and Laser, Off. And, did you understand the comment on the suit integrity check?
Fine, Al. Thank you. That helps us a lot.
Okay.
And Pan Camera Power, Off, when convenient, please. [Pause.]
Okay, it's Off.
Roger.
Roger.
Roger. Let's go back to P00.
Mine, too. Is mine in work?
No [laughter]. I got mine.
Yes.
[Garble] went that-a-way, huh? Okay. I got tape motion going, so I guess we might as well...
We don't need those guys.
Oh - beautiful. Fine.
[Garble] your private beverage.
Endeavour, this is Houston. You're coming up on LOS in about 2 minutes, and everything's looking just as slick as glass.
Okay, Joe; and, we're just sitting here in [the deep space] attitude, all set to dim the lights and do the gegenschein [photography].
Okay, Al; sounds like fun. Enjoy the back side, and see you in a few minutes. And if there's anything you need from us down here, just give a call. [Pause.]
[Laughter.]
Certainly, Joe.
[Laughter.]
Knew you would.
"Anything you need, give us a call."
[Laughter] Just like we're assigned right behind [garble].
Better check our camera time here.
153 even is where the Flight Plan calls us.
Go ahead.
Okay, in one minute, Al.
Yes. What frame time?
One frame, the whole minute.
Yes.
Ten seconds.
One in each hand. [Garble] look all right? Okay?
Looks like we're 1 minute and 18 seconds down in the Flight Plan.
Bravo. I want to go get a star mark.
Okay.
Hey. Got coffee?
Yes.
Yes. [Garble].
Okay, Jim, if you'll give us Free.
And turn the lights off down there.
Can't get used to it. We're getting free light out there.
Yes, that's some stuff, ain't it?
That's really bright.
Now we're trying the gegenschein, the midway point, and the Moulton point. But we got to do an attitude maneuver here in just a minute. In fact, in 3 minutes from now, to be precise, since we're getting a 3-minute exposure.
Yes, we're all right for that.
Here.
That's - that's in some bunch of ... anyway.
Well, you see the gegenschein?
Well, it should be straight ahead of us, Dave.
[Garble].
No.
Well, I'm not sure. I think we ought to get [garble] I - I - Why don't you look - I think it would be...
No. If there is such a thing, there's a - there's a very definite branch off from the Milky Way. Floating almost to big B. Well, it's not long.
No - no, the big hairy one.
Yes, that's right. No, it's - it's a localized area, you know. But it would probably be in the shape of an oval. Well, anyway, that's the only thing - that's the only thing that came close to that, was that thing that looked like a branch off the Milky Way. Double or nothing.
Okay, turn the lights up there, Jim.
No. Okay, go to CMC, Auto. Okay, now we want to maneuver to another point there: Midpoint attitude, Flight Plan.
Midpoint. I understand.
Okay, plus .6900.
Let's see.
5100? And minus 021.
No, 261.
Yes. Okay.
[Garble].
It's - it's in the [garble].
Oh, Jesus!
[Garble].
Shouldn't laugh at me.
Give him my regards.
Now break down a little bit. Look, he'll stay crazy if you're acting crazy. Look, Al, he doesn't understand.
We're down in the time line. Getting slightly green, Jimmy, my boy?
No.
I got to get it into Auto.
[Garble] getting [garble]?
Christ!
Yes, I know.
Now let the rate damp there for a second; hope it improves.
Okay, you're not losing face.
Yes. Right. Okay.
As I was saying...
Ah, go to hell, MDC.
What's that time on the other one? Time on the DSKY?
[Garble].
Mm-hmm. Yes, I used them, too.
What elevation? Yes.
Yes, there's quite a few stars out there, aren't there?
Christ! [Garble] given you?
A little darker now. Let's see. There's my star right up over there. Yes, that's...
[Garble].
[Garble].
Damn! You always seem to take it bad when you do an alignment.
Well, you can't be all crude and all. But that little - that - that little - that thing there is something. Might be another planet.
Why don't you [garble]?
Yes. Yes.
[Garble].
Yes.
[Garble].
Yes, trying to move [garble]. We've got another 5 minutes to go. Anyway, we've used...
Okay. Okay, Jim, lights up.
And we got a P20 coming then.
Yes, CMC, Auto. And this time we want maneuver to...
Yes. We have [garble].
We haven't [garble].
[Garble].
Well, got the housekeeping done.
We're not going to have a [garble].
That's a shame. [Garble].
I can't find...
Turn the lights down and look for a few minutes, if you want.
We don't have to stop for another 10 minutes yet.
So you can go to Attitude Hold there, Jim.
Or go to CMC, Auto.
Got it. Turn it down. Turn that damn thing down.
[Garble].
I want to look for a few minutes.
God damn. Is it in there?
You can see something bright down in there.
Al, could you move it?
No, it's [garble].
Yes.
[Garble].
No, can't see. I just can't see. [Garble] lights wouldn't come down. It's a function of lighting.
No. [Garble]. got [garble] something else.
No, I really can't see anything, Dave. [Garble].
Oh, shit. You're too easily impressed.
No one thinks like me.
Yes. As a matter of fact, that's what I keep saying.
Freak you.
That's not nice.
See if I can see that.
Oh, let me see. That's - that's too hard to see.
Okay.
[Garble].
They're not - they're not as bright as I thought they'd be, either.
They're not?
Is that right?
Yes. They're not - they're not much brighter than they are on Earth. Okay, lights up. Camera's off?
No, the guy wants that - business here. Yes.
Okay, Dave, will you put these back in B-2 for me, please?
Jim? Is that breaker off?
Yes, might as well call.
All right. I want to move these before I - [garble]. Ow!
All right.
Too early.
[Garble].
[Garble].
Yes.
Huh? Yes. Yes, I'm a person. Right here, Jim.
[Garble].
Well, put the TV back in...
If you will, snap that one.
It kind of gets in the way of everything else. Let me stick it down here for now.
Sure is fun with lots of people.
Stow them.
Put that one down here with mine.
What's that, Jim?
No!
Good. Very good.
Okay?
Yes. You got to - yes. We've already signed those, haven't we? We haven't signed these? It really doesn't make much difference, does it?
No.
We don't really have to sign them now I guess. We can do that anytime.
Yes, those - those covers would have been infinitely more valuable, I think.
Oh, well.
Maybe, Dave, it's just as well we didn't.
Okay.
Bastard.
[Garble].
I've got one. Come down.
God damn. Is it - is it in there?
Oh, I've only been changing the film; one in the LM and one in there. Come on down.
I'm going to have to go all the way back to the Moon to come on some of that.
[Laughter.]
[Garble].
Yes, very good. [Garble] that move.
[Garble]?
Yes.
What? No more film.
What?
[Garble]. I need more film [garble] camera [garble].
Can you change it?
[Garble].
Yes, but you know the way he is.
Feel around here.
Yes, sir.
[Garble].
Oh, no. But I don't think you are. [Garble].
That's the reason. Yes, yes, yes.
[Garble].
That doesn't take very long.
Where you going?
This guy's got more pens somewhere, because I need one to keep track of the Flight Plan, too.
Here's one.
[Garble], Al.
I got one.
Excuse me, Jim.
Excuse me.
Sure can.
[Garble].
Yes. I got one. Yes.
[Garble] solution in color [garble].
You got a mag that hasn't been used at all?
[Garble].
Huh? Just as - it may be just as well. Tell me we don't have any.
We don't - we don't have any of that left.
Hey, gang, they don't have another eat period for 6 hours.
What?
There's not another eat period in the Flight Plan for 6 hours.
Six more hours? Jesus Christ!
That's right. And that's just before our sleepy time.
Six hours to bed.
Yes. I don't think we need the contingency anymore. We don't need that one. Or these. Or these.
Can I get that map you got over there?
Okay. Yes, got...
Two of them here. Have three.
Okay, David.
Most of these don't.
Yes. Got two fresh maps here. One's labeled CMP and the other is labeled nothing.
Well, we missed some spectacular terminator photos. Damn. You know, I was wondering. You want to get the terminator photos if still possible. That would have really been spectacular.
[Garble].
Well, yes. The terminator's on the Flight Plan.
Yes.
Well, if we've got the film, by golly, I'd like to take a lot of terminator photos.
Yes.
No, that'd really be neat; take a bunch of terminators. And the setting should be the same regardless of where the terminator went.
[Garble].
Yes.
[Garble].
Boy. That one's - Look at that.
[Garble].
Do you know how to change the settings from 250 to 500?
[Garble].
No, I mean - I mean what the comparable settings are. Like f/5, 1/50th and all that.
[Garble].
Yes.
[Garble].
Terminator photos for the 250, they call out f/5.6 and 1/125th. And that's for the very-high-speed black and white. Yes. You don't have any left though, do you? No. Yes.
[Garble].
No. No, that's not fast enough. That's all right. Listen, I got lots of brand R left. Use it.
[Garble] something.
Yes.
Yes. It sure would be nice to get a - some pictures down into the bottom of [garble] bottom. [Garble].
Oh, deary.
The old Earth is real impressing down there. [Garble] get some.
[Garble].
Oh, boy! God, I guess. That thing was huge.
[Garble].
Never did, huh?
[Garble]. Never mind.
Houston, 15. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, Houston.
Hello, Houston. Endeavour here.
Roger, Al. Copy. And I've got a TEI-64 PAD when you're ready.
Okay, just a minute. [Long pause.]
Okay, go ahead with the PAD.
Rog, Alfredo. SPS/G&N for a TEI-64; 36310; plus 0.61, plus 0.92; 204:08:11.62, plus 3011.0, minus 0019.6, plus 0048.8; 180, 102, 002. All the rest NA. Ullage: 4 jet, 12 second. Over.
Roger, Joe. Understand TEI-64, SPS/G&N; 36310; plus 0.61, plus 0.92; 204:08:11.62; plus 3011.0, minus 0019.6, plus 0048.8; 180, 102, 002. The rest is NA. Four jet, 12 seconds.
Readback's correct, Al. Thank you.
Endeavour, Houston. [Pause.]
Hello, Houston; Endeavour. Go ahead.
Al, could you give us the Mass Spec. Discriminator switch to Low, please. [Pause.]
Mass Spec. Discriminator to Low.
Okay, thank you. And did you get a volunteer for [the] eye flash experiment?
Yes, I think we have a volunteer for you.
Okay.
Your volunteer is checking in here, Joe.
Okay, Jim. A quick word on it. Everything per the Flight Plan. We are going to ask you to go ahead and give us your description real-time on the downlink and your choice if you want to push-to-talk or go on to VOX. And then, when you go around the corner you can put it on the DSE like you did before, in High Bit Rate.
Okay, we'll do that, Joe. Stand by. That ought to be good. [Long pause.]
And, Endeavour, you'll be interested to know that the impact of Falcon was picked up on three beautiful seismometers on the Moon. A really remarkable record.
Which ones were they, Joe?
Apparently, they were the ones from Apollos 12, Apollos 14, and Apollos 15. We haven't had reports from other seismometers yet. [Pause.]
That's very interesting.
Tell us, Joe, did they get the LM impact close to where they wanted it? [Pause.]
Roger. It went in to within about a degree and in fact, as you know, it doesn't - the exact point isn't all that important. It - it went in just about where we wanted it, though. [Pause.]
And Al, as soon as you have Noun 79 and you give us Accept, we'll give you a state vector. Over.
Okay, Joe. You have it.
Rog. We see it. Thank you.
Okay, Joe, I'm ready to start the - experiment.
Okay, Jim, we're copying.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, Auto on High Gain, please. [Pause.]
Rog. Auto.
Al, this is Houston. You can go back into Block. We still need a half a degree deadband. And you can delete two lines in your Flight Plan, one at 197:04 and one at 9 - 197:09, both the "Pan Camera" lines there. Delete them. Over.
Rog, Joe. Understand. Delete the "Pan Camera" lines at 197:04 and 197:09.
Roger. You can Block the computer but we need a half a degree deadband.
Roger, Joe. I've loaded it a couple of times. Let me check it again. [Long pause.]
Okay, Joe. I've got half a degree in. Guess I'm having a hard time counting today.
Thank you, Al. I'm not doing any better.
Rog.
Joe, are you still there?
Go ahead.
As long I'm lying here waiting for a flash, I might comment that Dave and I both observed the flashes while we were on the surface, while we were in the bunks down there. We observed the flashes with the - oh, about the same frequency as we observed in orbit. One night there was about a 5-, 10-minute period there where I was awake, and I ran a little experiment by just turning over in the bunk. It seemed like the frequency was much less when I was lying on my stomach as opposed to lying on my back. It's just a - anote of interest.
Okay, Jim. That's a most interesting comment. And as you know, with about 10 minutes to go during the experiment today, we'll ask for you to - to turn over and be oriented with your face away from the Moon, and we might very well get the same sort of information this time.
Okay, no problem.
Okay, Joe. Go with the PAD.
Roger. Pan Camera PAD at 197 plus 16 plus 22. And you're to go to Operate per step 5 in your checklist, page S/1-38. And at 197 plus 18 plus 22, the Pan Camera to Standby. And at 197 plus 40, you can delete the P52 scheduled then. Over.
Roger, Joe. Understand. You want the Pan Camera to - to Operate at 197:16:22 as per the system's checklist 1-38 and to Standby at 197:18:22. And delete the P52 at 197:44 - or - 40.
Right on, Al. Thank you. And, Jim, we're standing by to copy your comments. [Pause.]
Roger, Joe. [Long pause.]
And, Jim, this is Houston. We'd like for you to transmit your description as well as the mark call, please.
Understand. [Long pause.]
Mark. And it was at the left eye; 8 o'clock, and it was a streak, and it seemed to be moving from 8 o'clock to maybe the 1 o'clock position, about - it covered about 20 degrees of arc out to a position - periphery at 8 o'clock into midway on our sphere of reference. An intensity of three. And...
Mark. I just had a flash at 1 o'clock, moving to the center - the center of - moving toward the 12 o'clock position. It was intensity 3. And that last one was the right eye.
Mark. A flash at the 12 o'clock, intensity 4.
That was right down the plus-X axis, Joe. [Pause.]
[Garble]. [Long pause.]
Roger, Jim. Copy. [Long pause.]
Mark. A flash at the 8 o'clock, left eye, periphery, intensity 2. [Long pause.]
Al, Pan Camera Stereo switch to Stereo, please.
Okay, Stereo it is. [Long pause.]
And Pan Camera to Standby. [Pause.]
Okay, Al. Thank you. That might be a super picture.
Sure hope so, Joe.
Jim, this is Houston. How are the eye flashes coming?
Still waiting, Joe.
Okay.
Mark. A first ray of flash, 10 o'clock, left eye, about three quarters of the way out to the periphery, intensity 5.
Mark. A streak, at 1 o'clock, moving from the bottom to the top of the - our sphere. Moving - moving definitely vertically up, beginning at 1 o'clock, about three quarters of the way up - intensity 2.
Jim, this is Houston. And we're still listening to you. In the meantime, I've got a Map Camera PAD to give to Al when he's ready. Over.
Okay, he'll be with you shortly.
Yeah. Hold on, Joe. We're going over the Harbinger Mountains and right over the Aristarchus Plateau right now. And Dave and I are looking like mad and taking pictures.
Fine, Alfredo. When you get back to me, I'll give you this other PAD. It's got to be within the next 15 minutes though.
Okay, Joe. No problem, we're about done. [Long pause.]
Mark. Flash at, seems like it was in both eyes, at about the 7 o'clock position, one quarter of the way out the periphery, intensity 5.
Houston, 15. Ready to copy the PAD.
Roger, Al. At 198 plus 25, [pause] go to narrow deadband in P20; Verb 22, Noun 79, plus 000.50. Open Cover and Extend Map Camera, per steps 3 and 4 in your checklist. 198 plus 31, Map Camera Image Motion, On. 198 plus 32 plus 10, Map Camera, On; Image Motion, increase, barber pole plus 4 steps; Laser Altimeter, On. 199 plus 19, Image Motion, increase, talkback barber pole. 199 plus 31 plus 56, Map Camera, Off; Laser Altimeter, Off; wait 30 seconds then Map Camera, On - That - that should read, Map Camera, On, to Standby; and then Retract and Close Cover, per steps 7,8 - 7 and 8 in the checklist. And that brings you to 199 plus 31 in your Flight Plan and you can delete the three lines at that point, "Map Camera Image Motion, On; Map Camera, On; Map Camera Image Motion, increase." Over. [Pause.]
Roger, Houston. Copy. At 198:15, go narrow deadband at P20. Open Mapping Camera Covers and Extend the Mapping Camera. At 198:31 plus 00, Mapping Camera, On. - Oh, I'm sorry, Image Motion, On. And 198 plus 32 plus 10, Mapping Camera, On; Image Motion to barber pole plus 4; and Laser Altimeter, On. At 199:19:00, Image Motion to barber pole. At 199:31:56, Mapping Camera, Off; Laser, Off; wait 30 seconds, Mapping Camera to Standby - No, that's Retract and Close Covers.
That's correct, Al; and you can delete those three lines at 199 plus 30. And - and there's a note that goes with this, that this particular pass will be taken with the Gamma[-ray] experiment and the Mass Spec. experiment booms extended. So don't worry about the fact they're out. One number you gave to me, the first one, should be 198 plus 25, go to narrow deadband. Over.
Roger. 198:25. That's what I had written. [I] read it wrong.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, Joe. During that conversation, I saw two - both at 8 o'clock. First one was three-quarters of the way out, intensity 2. The last one was at intensity 3, about halfway out, appeared to be at left eye.
Thank you, Jim; copied.
Mark. Flash at center, plus-X, intensity 2.
Mark. Flash, left eye, 9 o'clock, on the periphery, intensity 5.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Well, we ought to be able to tell in an hour.
Okay.
The what? Oh, yes. Okay?
Joe, how's the time going on my one hour?
Okay, Jim. My sand dial shows about 15 minutes remaining. You'll be going around the corner LOS shortly. We don't have any more instructions for you on the experiment or in fact on anything else going on. We would like your present - a description of your present position in the spacecraft. And, we'd like for you to remain in that position for the rest of the 15 minutes in the experiment. Over.
[Garble].
We are, Jim. I got it hot for you. Don't worry, pal, we won't forget you.
I'll bet you [garble].
Okay, understand you don't want me to turn over.
No. I think he's right here.
Neuter? Okay, that spaghetti is mine. Hamburger wet pack. Pea soup, ham and salad, applesauce, cheese crackers. Brack!
Blach! Does it look like it, Jim?
Yes.
You say it looks like it, Jim?
No.
Okay, Jim, copied that and that's correct. Just - just stay in your present position, and we'll see you on the other side.
You got eyes, they're almost 20 - 20, so - (laughter) Okay, it's a...
Okay.
I think it's time to raid you. I want to make sure they get it all down - down on the - on the file there.
Very good.
What?
That one's for you. Here. Have at it. [Garble] turn around [garble].
[Garble] here.
