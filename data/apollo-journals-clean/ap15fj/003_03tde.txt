Yes. There goes the panels, right out to the side. Right outside.
Yes, I see them now.
Yes.
See it?
Yes.
It's spinning out there. You see the...
What a view! You see the S-IVB?
Not yet.
We're at 270, now. Oh, ooops. Where is it?.
Right over Florida.
Okay. Good shape, man...
Are we?
You look good, good, good, good. Good job. Right in there, babe. Yes, that's good. Oh, look at that.
Take pictures with the cameras.
Yes.
on the TV.
No, forget the TV. The TV looks okay. Get the camera over here and take some pictures.
15, Houston. Would you give us Omni Bravo?
Omni Bravo.
Okay, I'm going to give it a little plus-X.
Okay.
Going to CMC first.
Got a T - good TV picture, Dave?
Yes.... just a little off to the side, Al?
Hum?... Okay.
Don't want to get too far away, now.
1, 2, 3, 4.
TV picture is...
To the right.
Back on CMC.
Okay....?
Yes.
Okay, Houston. Looks like you've got a good LM in there, and we're rolling now, and the opening rates are stopped, and you should have a TV.
Roger. We haven't got the picture up here yet. Stand by, and I'll give you a check on that.
Okay.
Okay.
I can shift that camera if you want, Dave.
No. It would just be... the orientation the LM has for the attitude.
Yes, that is a big bang when you come off of there, isn't it?
Yes.
Guess we're - what, 50 feet?
Take it at f/8.
All I've got to look at it is the TV picture.
15, Houston.
Go, Houston.
Goldstone's receiving the carrier, but we're not getting any signal on the carrier for the TV. Over.
Okay; we've got a good picture on the monitor up here.
Well, it's not in Transmit.
What?
This switch here should probably go to Transmit.
Well, put it...
Let's try...
Check those...
Do what? How about S-Band Aux TV to TV?
Yes, sir....
Hey, we need High Gain, don't we?
You have. I've got... use High Gain...
High Gain.
Okay.
15, Houston; we're getting a picture now, and the LM is coming in, in the lower right-hand corner of our field of view.
Okay.
Well...
Of course,... your pictures. Take your pictures.
It was a lot slower than I thought it would be.
Strange.
Yes.
As long as they're getting the picture on the Omni, I guess there's no hurry to - that we get the High Gain up.
Okay, Houston. It looks like we've got a good High Gain Antenna. Do you want us to give you the High Gain or stay on the Omni?
Stand by.
We'll take the High Gain, Dave.
There's sure a lot of crap flying out...
Rog. Going High Gain.
Okay, Houston. We're in Auto and Medium. Looks like we got a good lock.
Roger; and we're getting a very good picture here. It's - it's over on the right-hand side of the field of view.
Get the DAC going.
Shall I put the TV... long, Dave.
Huh! I think it looks good, Jim.
I can adjust it and get it in center.
No, it's -... How're you doing?
How many pictures...
15, Houston. request wide beamwidth please.
Wide Beam.
I find I'm working the stick a lot more than I thought I would.
Yes.
Just play it cool. We've got plenty of time.
Yes.
Play it cool.
Six on your camera would be right where you'd want it.
Okay.
Okay. I would say we were - what, Jim? 20 feet? 15? 10?
I have 15 feet on the camera.
Did we forget anything on that checklist, Dave?
Okay. We're sliding in there, David.
Okay. I think we're about a couple feet away.
Yes.
What do you want to do?
Put it at 12 frames per second.
Okay, I'd go now if...
15, Houston. The centering on the picture is good now, and we're getting an excellent quality picture.
Very good. We're almost there.
Okay.
Okay.
Jim.
Feel it.
Got it?
About there.
Help you?
Capture.

Roger.
Okay?
Read the checklist, Jim.
Okay; let's go down the checklist. You get... Okay, On capture, changing Free, to damp, align pitch and yaw...
Still got a little pitch rate going.
Huh?
You're fine. Just align pitch and yaw.
Okay.
They're all aligned and damped out?
on the chart....
Okay. Looks like we're damped.
Okay; ready?
We're off at a little bit of an angle.
Here. I can hold this a minute....
Okay, Dave.
Yes.... Ready to retract?
We're retracting.
Roger.
Okay.
Your rate's going? Don't mess around.
Hard dock, Houston.

Roger. I understand the SPS Thrust light is on.
And all the switches are off.
Apollo 15, Houston.
Go ahead.
Stand by one.

I don't think I am.
Okay.
Okay.
Want to do it on the minute?

Three seconds.. Okay.
Yes.
We've done it.
Okay, Houston. We got a good sep.

You mean it's there?
Yes, man.
Is it really? Okay.
Okay. Keep it moving.
What, Jim?
Give me your checklist.
Oh, yes, I can't get this doggone thing...
Just put it down there and let's keep it going.
Okay.
Okay - Read to me. I've got to get down in the SIM bay....
Here, I can probably do that easier than you can.
Let me take - Why don't we configure our helmets and gloves off?
Huh...
Yes, why not?
Well, we do a maneuver here, don't we?
Yes. We've got to do a maneuver to the S-IVB.
Let's get through this thing.
We're already doing attitude.
Okay.
That should take only a Verb 49, since we've already loaded it.
O2 tank 3 Isolation valve talkback gray.
That's verified.
Okay, Map, Pan, and SM/AC Power should be Off. I'll get them. You're in all of that junk...
No. Well, now...
You've got all that junk on; I don't want you to scratch your helmet.
Okay. Yes, take care of my helmet for me.
You've got to.
Yes.
So you can see.
That's right. Here, if you're going to get down, I'll read to you.

And, Al, Launch Vehicle SPS Indicator switch to GPI.
Okay, Houston; 15. We have the S-IVB in sight, and it looks like it's probably about - oh 7 or 8 hundred feet away.
Roger.
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Roger. We have the S-IVB in sight, and it looks like it's 500 feet or so away.
Roger. We copied the first time. If it's okay with you and looks clear, we'll command the yaw maneuver.
Ah Roger, and it looks like a clean bird out there.
Roger. We'll be sending the yaw command at 4:31.
Roger.
Okay. We can see the thruster activity on the S-IVB.
Roger.
It looks like a light mist and a sort of conical shape, maybe - oh, a hundred feet long or so.
Rog.
And, Houston, as a sidelight, we can verify that the Falcon has his Rover aboard.
Very good.
Houston, 15.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, 15.
As we watch the S-IVB drift away here, how about passing along to Jim Harrington at the Cape, congratulations from the crew to the launch team for a superior job.
Okay. We sure will.
Smooth all the way, and right on time.
Gerry Griffin reports that he's already done that.
Good.
But we'll second it from the crew.
Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
Houston, 15.
I was thinking about your "SPS Thrust On" light problem, and we'd like you to verify the positions of the EMS Function and Mode switches.
Rog. Off and Standby.
Roger.
Houston, this is 15. We're starting to configure for charging battery B.
Roger.
Apollo 15, Houston.
Houston, 15.
I think you may have missed a Verb 66 - right there just after LM ejection. We need one now.
Roger. In works.
And, Houston, 15. The S-IVB looks nice and stable out there. You're Go for your basic maneuver as far as we're concerned.
Okay, fine. We're just about to ask you on that.
Okay.
It'll be started at 4:40.
Roger; 4:40. And we're just about 90 degrees abeam.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. We see the S-IVB moving very slowly.
Roger.
Houston, this is 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Do you want us to terminate the charge when - when I'm reading 39.5?
Stand by. Ah, Jim, we'll call you, based on integrated amp-hours that we figure out down here.
Okay; fine.
Houston, 15.
Go ahead.
Okay; we have a LM/CM Delta-P of plus.2 at the present time.
Roger, Dave, plus.2.
15, Houston.
Houston, 15. Go ahead.
We need to have you re - reinitialize the High Gain. We'd like you to set Pitch, minus 30; Yaw, plus 98; and go to Reacq. Over.
Roger. We copied minus 30 and plus 98.
Roger.
Houston, 15. How do you read?
Loud and clear.
15, Houston. Watch your middle gimbal.
Roger.
15, Houston.
Houston, 15. Go ahead.
At 5:01:20, we'll be starting a LOX dump through the S-IVB engine. And we have the REFSMMAT when you're ready for it - for the P52.
Okay. you want P00 and Accept?
Affirm.
15, Houston, the computer is yours. You have a new REFSMMAT and the trunnion bias has been zeroed.
Roger, Gordo. Thank you.
