Boy, that puts that star smack in the middle. Beautiful. Okay. Are we in P20, Jim?
Yes, P20's coming up. Option...
We...
...option 5.
We were in it before, weren't we?
Yes.
Okay. Okay, we got it for TEI ascent. No, wait a minute.
Okay. It calls for GDC Align. Yes, you went back in P20; I'll go CMC Mode, Auto, huh?
Yes, go Auto.
Okay, then GDC Align.
That has to be done from your couch there.
Yes.
Can you do it?
I can do one. I'll - probably use the checklist. It's been a long time since I've gone through one.
Minus 5 and 25.
[Garble] burn, Al? Get all your [garble] all set? No, you're [garble] open.
Yes, I guess it would [garble].
[Garble] TEI?
Put the optics away. [Garble].
Well, we might as well get in our regular couches then, huh?
What?
Do you want me to switch around to regular couches there?
Yes. [Garble].
A GDC Align is required. And then a P20. I think we need to - change the deadpan [sic] - dead band.
And when we come - come around, we get the maneuver pad.
How long until the shaping burn?
Two hours.
No. [Garble].
Well, we ought to start getting cleaned up then for it. Let's see. Yes, yes. We don't have a sheet. Okay.
[Garble] G&C Checklist, I guess that - Where's that in the G&C Checklist? Let's see what we're doing here.
[Garble]?
Okay. Let's see what I've got here now. I'll do the - do a GDC Align, huh?
Did you [garble] the jett bag, Al?
Yes. [Garble] got it here in B-1.
Hey, Al. We want to change the dead band in P20 here...
Yes.
...5 degrees.
Okay. Do a Verb 22, Noun 79.
Oh, I see that. Is that all you have to do? You don't have to - while we're in a...
That's all you have to do.
Just put in this entry bit, huh?
Yes.
Plus 005 00?
Yes.
Okay. That's entered.
Okay. That should do it then.
Need any help, Al?
No, I can get it ali right, Jim.
Let's see, did we decide to throw those two urine bags and the jett bag? I don't have to - transfer those?
Don't dump those yet. We're going to Jettison them.
Yes, we can just jettison them.
Yes.
When is the next dump period?
Coming up in about 2 hours.
Before the burn, I guess.
Harem. After the burn.
Just after the burn is the dump.
Oh, really?
Yes.
We're in pretty good shape, Dave, except I don't know what to do with LEVA bags for the burn.
With the what?
With the LEVA bags.
You got straps for them, to clamp - to clamp them down. No. There are three straps down on the EVA tunnel [garble]...
Hmm.
And strap down those - and I'd suggest that somebody reach up and strap - and strap them down.
Could be we better do that.
You got them?
Yes. They ought to put the utility straps in the...
We better get these other cameras tucked away, too. Where would you suggest putting...
Hey!
...these cameras we got?
Why not put them all in B-1? We could stuff that JETT bag around them so they won't get banged up too much. They'd probably all fit in there.
Or you could just put them in the JETT bag?
Well, we might want to use them again.
Well, we know where they are. Yes.
What's this bag here?
What?
That's your tether kit.
Oh. Okay.
You're going to need it.
That's good. That's good.
[Garble].
Everything except the PPK.
Yes. What's - what was in that PPK, by the way?
I don't see how you can get used to it with all these bags, huh?
Yes.
[Garble].
[Garble].
Um.
Um. Um-huh...
What?
...Very interesting. I don't know. I'll let you know in a minute. Oh, there we are. Christ, I thought they were - I thought somebody'd blown it.
Huh?
I thought somebody'd blown it. The OPS straps weren't in the OPS strap pouch.
You don't think...
Yes (laughter). Huh?
You don't think that [garble].
Yes, who'd do something like that?
[Garble].
[Laughter.] Yes.
Okay.
You know, I think we better dump - we better dump those out. We better not put them in the jett bag.
Huh?
Probably [garble].
Yes, they're apt to break.
You don't have to dump. Jim will help you.
(Laughter) Yes. Okay, how about gathering up as many of the utility straps as you can around. Let's see if we can get enough here to put these LEVAs down.
There's some up here in [garble] I can't disagree with gathering them up.
These won't work on here.
Pull on it here. Pull those out just a little.
Here, Jim. I think this is yours.
Mm. It's anybody's [garble].
Huh?
[Garble].
In here?
[Garble].
Which? Oh, yes.
[Garble].
Yes, that one - I cleaned it out. And that - we're going to have to use that tomorrow.
[Garble].
So you want to put that into B-1.
[Garble].
Yes.
Hey, Al? [Garble] Gamma-ray and Alpha ray and ... all that stuff [garble].
Not supposed to, Dave. They don't - they don't like it.
[Garble] they give us 2 minutes to dump.
Two minutes?
Yes, 2 minutes between dumping and turning on all that gamma, X-ray, and alpha ray stuff.
Well, the gamma - We'll turn it on.
What?
We'll turn it on.
It'll screw it up, won't it?
Well, it ain't going to screw up the experiment. It'll screw up their data. And they'll go back to the Flight Plan and look, and they'll say, "Yes, sure, they're dumping."
Where's the other needle there, Jim?
We aren't even counting [garble].
We don't care about that. Dave, if you can reach around there on the back of you, on that LEVA that I put on the - on the - on A-8 back there, there's another stop towards the head end - If you want, go ahead and snap it.
Over this one...
Yes, I already put a strap on it, but I couldn't reach it.
[Garble].
[Laughter.] Yes.
[Garble].
Huh?
You may not believe it, but there's no snap...
Oh, there's no snap up there? Oh, shitl Can we tie it to something up there?
Yes.
Actually, it'll be all right with one strap probably. It won't...
[Garble].
No, it's not going to go anywhere.
In fact, these other snaps don't really cinch things down tightly; they just kind of hold them in place.
[Garble].
Gee, we're running out of snaps.
Hey, I bet you we can put a couple of bags and a couple - helmets in the top of the PGA bag.
[Garble] if you use these [garble].
Okay. Yes, we'll be using it on the way home. But we can put it away for now. It's probably just as well.
Yes.
It's hot in here. You want to undo it?
Yes. That's an easy one.
[Garble].
By the UVs and goes into A-8, though.
What?
Goddam U thing - UV thing goes in the A-8, and that's underneath all the LEVAs and everything else.
[Garble]. somewhere else [garble].
Excuse me, Jim.
[Garble].
Yes, they go down here.
What else have we got?
Pardon?
[Laughter.] Before - before I go tearing into those lockers again, what else have we got?
[Garble].
Yes. Where's mag R?
Ah, I think it's [garble] there.
Is it used up yet?
Yes, it is. Didn't we do it...
All right. Stash it away here then.
Here's R. Does it belong there with all that stuff?
I don't think [Garble].
I got three hands full. How about the dark slides for our...
[Garble].
Huh?
[Garble] use one of those?
No.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
What about the [garble]?
Have to pull it on. The N-pack, too.
[Garble].
[Garble].
Get me that cinch. I must be getting weak.
Endeavour. This is Houston. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Houston. Endeavour.
Roger. Could you tell us, please, the status of the Pan Camera switch? [Pause.]
Roger. Right now, it's in Standby and Power and it's been barber pole.
Okay, we copy that, Endeavour. You can go ahead and power it down. We've run through to the last of the Pan Camera film.
Roger. [Long pause.]
And, 15. We've powered up the drugstore to receive the film when you get home.
Roger. Better get a couple. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, a last request on that Pan Camera. Requesting Power, On and Operate, please.
Roger. Power, On and Operate. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, requesting Accept for your new state vector and a shaping target load.
Rog. You've got it.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, this is Houston. We've reverified that your Pan Camera is out of film, and you can power it down for us, please, for the final - final time. Over. [Pause.]
Joe, you'll have to give us that transmission again. We were off [garble] temporarily.
Roger, Jim. Just said that we've reverified that the Pan Camera is out of film and you can power it down for the final time at your convenience.
Understand.[Long pause.]
Endeavour, we have a preliminary TEI-74 PAD, if you're ready to copy. [Pause.]
Stand by one, Joe.
Roger, Jim. No hurry. [Long pause.]
Okay, Joe. Ready to copy.
Roger. TEI-74 preliminary, SPS/G&N; 35852; plus 0.62, plus 0.96; 223:48:43.63; plus 2945.0, minus 0769.6, minus 0152.8; 000, 000, 000; NA, plus 0022.3; 3047.7, 2:22, 3029.4; 37, 224.3, 30.5; NA, NA, NA; plus 26.12, minus 157.98; 1083.8, 36179; 294:58:40. GDC Align, Vega and Deneb; Roll align, 102; 178; 028. Ullage: 4 jet, 12 seconds. Standing by for readback. Over. And the computer's yours, Endeavour. [Pause.]
Roger, Joe. Would you start with Delta-VT, again? I missed that.
Rog. Delta-VT is 3047.7; BT, 2:22; and Delta-VC, 3029.4. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. Read on down the rest of that PAD, from there on down.
Oh, okay; coming at you, Jim. The sextant is 37, 224.3, 30.5; NA, NA, NA; latitude, plus 26.12; longitude, minus 157.98; 1083.8, 36179; and GET 294:58:40. Vega and Deneb; 102; 178; 028; 4 jet, 12 seconds. Over.
Okay, Joe. Readback for TEI-74 preliminary. SPS/G&N; 35852; plus 0.62, plus 0.96; 223:48:43.63; plus 2945.0, minus 0769.6, minus 0152.8; zero for roll, pitch and yaw; Delta-VT 3047.7, 2:22, 3029.4, 37, 224.3, 30.5; latitude, plus 26.12, minus 157.98; 1083.8, 36179; 294:58:40. Vega and Deneb; 102; 178; 028; 4 jet for 12 seconds. [Pause.]
That's correct, Jim, and your Noun 44 is NA and plus 0022.3 and readback's correct.
Roger; copied. HP is plus 0022.3. [Long pause.]
And Jim; this is Houston. Could you adjust your S-band volume for us, please? You have a side tone squeal when you transmit and the - the volume is - is fairly weak for us. Give us a count before you do it and after you do it. And, would you reverify the Delta-VY for us? Over. [Pause.]
Okay, Delta-VY was minus 0769.6. [Pause.]
Okay, Jim. Thank you. And the volume is better. Thank you. [Pause.]
And, Houston; Endeavour. We're just finishing up final stowage right now, and we'll be with you in a couple of minutes on the procedures.
Okay, we're standing by. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, at your convenience, Gain Step switch to center, please. And I have the shape SPS/G&N PAD, when you're ready for that. [Pause.]
Okay, Joe. Gain Step is center, and I'm ready on the shape PAD.
Roger, Jim. Shape, SPS/G&N; weight, 36171; plus 0.63, plus 0.98; 221:20:47.23; plus 0017.0; minus all zips, minus 0064.2; 355, 198, 010; 0076.1, plus 0054.3; and, Jim, why don't you readback from there, and I'll pick up again. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. It's shape, SPS/G&N; 36171; plus 0.63, plus 0.98; 221:20:47.23; plus 0017.0; minus all zips, minus 0064.2; 355, 198, 010; 0076.1, plus 0054.3.
Right on, Jim. Delta-VT is 0066.4, 0:03, 0054.8; [pause] sextant, 13, 164.3, 12.6; 001, down 09.1, left 4.6. The rest is NA. GDC Align, Vega and Deneb; roll align, 102; 178; 028. Four jet, 12 seconds. Other is subsat launch, GET 222 plus 39 plus 27; roll, 266; pitch, 141; yaw, 038. High Gain [Antenna angle]: pitch, minus 70; yaw, plus 113. Standing by for readback starting with Delta-VT. Over.
Okay, Joe. 0066.4, 0:03, 0054.8; 13, 164.3, 12.6; 001, down 09.1, left 4.6; Vega and Deneb; 102; 178; 028. Four jet for 12 seconds; subsatellite launch, GET 222:39:27; roll, 266; pitch, 141; yaw, 038. High Gain is pitch, minus 70; yaw, plus 113. Over.
Right on the money. Thank you, sir. [Pause.]
And, Jim, I guess those High Gain angles are to be applied to the shaping maneuver, not the subsat launch. [Pause.]
Okay. [Pause.]
And, Houston, we're ready to talk over the procedures any time you are now.
Okay, Endeavour, I guess we're ready to start. I want to put one final note on the subsat launch. We'd like for you to reverify for us the talkbacks on the RCS after the launch. [Pause.]
Okay. Understand. Check the RCS talkbacks after the launch. We'll do that.
Okay, Dave; and I guess you might cast an eye up at the - the few - fuel cell - talkbacks as well. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, this is Houston. Ready to tag up with you on the TEI procedures. And, Dave, I guess we're standing by for your recommendation. Do you want to read through the additions you now have in your P40 SPS Thrusting Checklist, or do you want us to go through the changes we want you to have there? It looks pretty much exactly like your TLI maneuver. There are just two changes; there are two difference from that, I guess. Over.
Okay, why don't you give us the two differences, and then we'll read it all back to you to make sure we've got it straight.
Okay, Dave. That sounds like a good way. Turn to page G5-4. And right down at the bottom of the page...
5-4. Go.
Roger. Right at the bottom of the page after the two lines, "SPS Fuel/Oxidize Pressure" and "PUGS balanced", add the step "Cut-off minus 10 seconds, circuit breaker SPS Pilot Valve, Main A to Open." [Pause.]
Okay: bottom line on page 5-4. Cut-off minus 10 seconds, "Circuit Breaker SPS Pilot Valve, Main A, Open."
That's correct. And turning over a page to 5-5, you have an addition underneath the normal step which reads, "Circuit Breaker SPS Pitch 1 and yaw 1 to Open". Your addition reads, "Circuit Breaker SPS Pilot Valve, Main B, Open." And we have still another step to add in there, which is, "Circuit Breaker EMS, two of them, Main A and Main B, to Open." And, also, we would like to delete, one step below that, the three lines, "Map Camera, On, to Off," "Pan Camera Power to Off," and "SM/AC Power to Off." Over.
Okay; on page 5-5, beneath the addition of "CB/SP - S - SPS Pilot Valve, Main B, Open," add "CB EMS, two, Open," and them delete the three lines on Map Camera, Pan Camera, and SM/AC power below that.
That's correct, Dave, and we're standing by for the other additions you've made, now.
Okay, we'll go back to the beginning, here. [Pause.] Okay; our initial configuration has the addition of both Pilot Valve Circuit Breakers Open, and to verify that both EPS Group 5 circuit breakers are Closed, and also on page 5-1, beneath the caution/warning test, EMS Function, Off, to verify, and the CB EMS A&B both Closed. That's what we have on 5-1.
Okay; that's good. Turn the page.
Okay, on 5-2, under "TVC Check and Prep", second line, "CB SPS (10), closed". That's all on 5-2.
Roger.
Page 5-3, at minus 2 minutes, "CB SPS Pilot Valve, Main B, Closed", instead of Delta-3 - "Delta-V Thrust A and B, Normal".
That is correct.
Okay. And on page 5-4, at 5 minutes prior to ignition when we get - 5 seconds prior to ignition when we get the flashing 99, we Delta-V Thrust A and B to Normal after the Pro. And then, on down at ignition, if we have a flashing 97, the SPS thrust fail, "CB SPS Pilot Valve A, Closed". And, if everything goes according to Hoyle, why, at 5 seconds, we'll close the C - CB SPS Pilot Valve Mi - Main A. And then, of course, the step you just answered - just added - at the bottom of the page, at cut-off minus 10 seconds, to close the Pilot Valve - or to open the Pilot Valve Main A.
Okay, Dave. That's right on the money.
Okay. And then on 5-5, we just discussed those two, which were a "CB SPS Pilot Valve, Main B, Open", and the "EMS circuit breakers, Open".
Roger, Dave. That sounds good to us.
Okay; and I think we've practised one of those once before. I think we'll be able to handle that. [Long pause.]
Dave, just out of curiosity, we know you or Al...
Yes.
...marked up the cue card for the plane change maneuver, and we wonder if you're going to use that marked-up card for the shape burn. Over.
No, no. We'll use the checklist straight through on the rest of the burns. [Pause.]
Okay, Dave. That's fine with us as we know you're aware it's a single bank B burn, which has been marked correctly onto that cue card. [Pause.]
Rog. Yeah, I guess all - all our burns in orbit are just a straight single bank B.
Right on. Thank you. [Long pause.]
And, coming out, we'll have all the ball valves open and all the eyeballs watching. [Pause.]
Sounds like a good idea.
And, Houston; Endeavour. [Pause.]
Go ahead. [Pause.]
We were just getting the hoses set up here for the burn and noticed that there's a little bit of water coming out of the - the blue hose in the suit loop. Thought you might be interested. [Long pause.]
Okay, Dave. We copy that. Thank you.
Roger. [Pause.]
Not much. It's just, if you put your hand around the nozzle there, why, you can get some water on it.
Okay; we copy that. We think it's probably normal, but we'll look into it real closely. Sounds to me like the Endeavour has a few plumbers aboard as well as experts in other things.
Well, by the time this is over, I guess we will be plumbers.
We'll all be plumbers, Davy.
Endeavour, you're looking good. You are Go for the shaping burn.
Rog. Go for the shape.
Okay, Houston. Endeavour with a burn status report.
Go ahead, Endeavour. [Pause.]
Okay. Burn was on time, and it was a 3-second burn. We had about 1.0 or 1.1 residual, and that was trimmed to 0.1, minus 0.2, minus 0.2. Delta-VC was minus 11.0; fuel, 26.40; oxidizer, 26.25. [Pause.]
Rog, Dave. We copy that. [Pause.]
And it has us in an orbit, 76.0 by 54.3 [nautical miles, 140.8 by 100.6 km].
Sounds just right. [Pause.]
And very smooth burn.
Okay, Dave. Great. And you just gained about 240 more days for our subsatellite, something like that.
Very good.
Endeavour, this is Houston. You're looking good at LOS minus 5. And I have a reminder on your water dump. We'd like you to monitor it down to 10 percent. And we'll see you on the other side. Over.
Rog. Understand. Will do.
Endeavour, this is Houston. And we've copied your torquing angles.
Roger. Thank you, Houston.
... it in the SIM bay, huh?
Yes.
Okay. Waste water's down to about 20.
Okay, we'll purge. Are you going to time her?
Uh-huh.
Fifty.
Up to Relief, huh?
Yes.
Uh-huh. Up to Relief, right?
Eighty degrees.
... to do that on the front-side pass?
Yes.
Think we'll be okay once we get out in the...
H2 Purge Line Heaters, Off.
All you got to do is look after the purge, huh?
Yes.
I'm going to purge.
We got this great big filter floating around. Why is that floating around?
I'm sorry, Dave. I'll throw it in the diaper bag.
Gee, Jim, we got to make another burn.
Yes.
I didn't realize we were so close to another burn. ... close.
No, I didn't either.
...
Yes.
Where'd you put the second garbage can?
...
Al, wait. Stick it up here. No, wait.
Did you have any tissues down here when you did your thing, Jim?
No, I didn't have any, Dave.
How did you get by?
How'd I get by? I used the...
Yes.
...UCTA. I used the UCTA. So I had to dump it anyway.
Yes. Right over there with the camera is, we got to configure the DAC anyway. Open it up. You got to put the DAC together anyway for photographing the subs at.
What? Yes. Didn't think about that.
... in the way.
I'll get it...
Okay, I got it.
Okay.
There. ...
Clear.
Oh, my. Look at this. That's a good picture.
Hello, Endeavour. This is Houston. [Pause.]
Houston, Endeavour. Go.
Roger, Endeavour. We're requesting you verify your systems - Data Systems, On, and the S-band Aux switch to Science, please. [Long pause.]
Yes.
Right here it is.
Huh!
Yes. That's verified, isn't it?
No, Data Systems isn't On.
Well, it wasn't in here then.
It sure was and I missed it. I'm sorry.
Okay; that's verified now, the data systems are on now.
Shoot!
They're easy to overlook, aren't they?
Okay, Dave; we copy that. I've got a map update, rev 75, when you're ready to copy. And I have a message for Al from the King [Farouk El-Baz], when he's ready to copy. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Joe.
Roger, Al. The message to you is to stand by to copy your final exam grade in orbital science and observation. It's an alpha-plus, with a subnote of "Well done." Over. [Pause.]
Tell the King, thank you very much, Joe.
Rog, Al. And I've got the map update...
And I expect to see him back in Houston soon.
Oh! Oh, no - no problem there.
Go ahead, Joe.
Rog. The map update, rev 75. Copy at 223 plus 20. [Pause.] And it is: LOS, 223 plus 29 plus 45; 180, 223 plus 52 plus 57; AOS with TEI, 224 plus 03 plus 03; AOS without TEI, 224 plus 15 plus 30. Over.
Okay, the map update readback for rev 75: 223:29:45, 223:52:57, 224:03:03 and 224:15:30.
Readback's correct, Jim; thank you.
Endeavour. We verify your SIM pyro bus...
This is Endeavour. Can you verify the...
...arm, and - your rates look good to us down here. Over.
Okay. You had us all figured out. We'll go Free.
Rog, Dave. [Long pause.]
And we know one of you will be watching out the window. We're particularly interested if the spin of the satellite is sweeping out a cone or if it seems to be a fairly flat spin as it comes out. Over.
Roger.
Endeavour, we're requesting you go back to Auto and do another Verb 49, please. We see you've drifted off about a degree.
In work.
Okay, Endeavour. We're recommending that you go back to Free at launch minus one minute.
Okay; Free at launch minus one minute.
Endeavour, we've got a new update to the last instructions. Go Free at launch, please. [Pause.]
Rog; Free at launch.
Three, two, one...
...Launch. We have a barber pole. [Pause.]
And a gray.
We confirm that. [Pause.]
Tally Ho! [Long pause.]
Okay, Dave; copied that. Sounds great. [Pause.]
Can you see much? [Long pause.]
Oh, looks like it might be oscillating maybe 10 degrees at the most. [Long pause.]
Roger, Dave; copy. [Long pause.]
