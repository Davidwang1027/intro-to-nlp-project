Endeavour, this is Houston. Over.
Hello, Houston. Hello, Houston. This is Endeavour.
Roger. [We've] had a CapCom shift [change] here, Al, and you're coming up on a change from - to Mono on the Pan Camera. I'll let you get that, in about...
Say again, Houston.
...20 seconds. Endeavour, Houston. In 15 seconds, you need to change the Pan Camera to Mono. Just a reminder.
Okay. [Long pause.]
And, Al, when you're ready, I have a P24 PAD, the LM visual, and also a couple of changes to the Flight Plan. Over.
Okay. I'm all set up and ready to copy.
Okay. P24 landmark track PAD, LM visual. T-1 is 106:33:59; T-2 is 106:38:06; TCA is 106:40:29; T-3 106:40:57; you're off-track three nautical miles north. And one note on that, use Omni Charlie. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. Copy. P24 PAD. T-1, starting with the times, T-1, 106:33:59; 38:06; 40:29; 40:57; off-track north, three miles, and use Omni Charlie.
Okay; readback's correct. And [there's a Flight Plan] change at 106:45. Let me know when you're there.
You say you have a change at 106:45?
That's affirmative, Al. Change where it says "Gamma-ray, Gain Step, Shield, Off." Change that to read "Gamma-ray: Gain Step, increase one step." Over.
Understand, Gordo. It says "Gamma-ray, Gain Step, increase one step" at that time.
That's affirmative. Then at 106:56, delete the "Gain Step, Shield, On" remark there, and the reason is to adjust the spectrum. Over.
Rog; understand. You want that whole line deleted at - at 106:56, then.
That's affirmative, Al.
Endeavour, Houston. Reminder, Pan Camera, Stereo, at 14:58.
Rog.
Endeavour, Houston. 20 seconds to your camera T-stop time.
Rog, Gordo.
Endeavour, Houston. We're ver - we verify that the lens is tucked in. You're clear to turn the Pan Camera, Off.
Roger.
Endeavour, Houston. If you read, Omni Charlie.
Endeavour, Houston. Endeavour, Houston. Give us Omni Charlie, if you read.
Endeavour, Houston. If you read, go Omni Charlie. [Pause.]
Hello, Houston; Endeavour. On Omni Charlie now.
Okay, Al. Loud and clear, and you're just about to T-1. I guessed you just passed it.
Okay, Gordo. And I've been reading you right along.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, Houston. We're getting kind of a weak signal. Would you go to best Omni. [Pause.]
Roger, Gordo. Going best. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston; Endeavour. Looks like Omni Charlie's it.
Roger. Understand you're on Omni Charlie. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, Houston. We can't get a - a data with you. We'd like you to put the DSE to Low Bit Rate, Record, Forward, and Command Reset.
Okay. Understand you want Low Bit Rate, Record, Forward and Reset.
That's affirmative, Al.
Okay, Gordo. You got it.
Roger. I think we're getting a little better comm now. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, Houston. You're T-2 now.
Roger. I have the landing site in view.
Roger. Very good.
Okay. And, Houston; Endeavour. I've got the LM.
Roger, Al.
I'll give you the coordinates in a minute.
Okay.
But he's almost directly north of Index.
Roger. Understand. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, Houston. You're TCA now.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay. He's about half way between Index and the next crater off towards the North Complex. He's sitting right by a very small crater. And, as soon as I lose them here, I'll give you the coordinates, but he's quite plain down there.
Roger, Al.
Houston, Endeavour.
Go ahead, Al, Houston.
Okay, Gordo. If you look at the grid map, 1 to 250; that's HR25-11, he's on BR, .5, 75.5.
Okay; Copy. Baker Romeo, .5 and 75.5?
That's affirm.
Okay; thank you.
Endeavour, Houston. Give us Omni Bravo, please.
Okay. You've got Omni Bravo.
Okay, Al.
Houston, Endeavour. The - the Gamma-ray boom is out and took 2:30; 2 minutes and 30 seconds, fixed in.
Roger; 2 minutes and 30 seconds, Al. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, Houston. One other thing, if you don't have it already, we'd like to have the S-Band Squelch, Off, so you'll realize the loss of signal, Over.
Rog, Gordo. I've got it Off now.
Roger.
Endeavour, Houston. 30 seconds now to T-start for the Mapping Camera.
Rog, Gordo. I'm all set for it.
Endeavour, Houston. When you have a minute, I have another Pan Camera PAD.
Okay; I'm ready. Go ahead.
This one goes [in the box in the Flight Plan] at 108:10.
Rog.
Okay. T-start is 108:15:27, and T-stop is 108:43:15. Over.
Understand. T-start is 108:15:27; T-stop is 108:43:15.
Roger. The last seconds on the T-stop are 43:15. Is that what you've got?
That's correct, Gordo; 15, 43:15.
Okay. For the information, the LM troops are in the middle of the SEVA now, and Dave is standing up in the hatch and taking the panoramic pictures.
Oh, very good.
Endeavour, Houston. Go ahead.
Houston, Endeavour didn't call. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, Houston. Over.
Houst - Houston, Endeavour. Go ahead.
We'd like you to bring up the High Gain [Antenna]. Use Pitch of minus 38 and Yaw, 186. Over.
Roger. Understand; minus 38, 186. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston; Endeavour. You've got the High Gain now.
Okay, Al. Thank you.
Endeavour, Houston. Would you give us Auto on the High Gain.
Roger, Houston. Auto on the High Gain.
Thank you, Al.
Endeavour, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Endeavour, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Endeavour. Go ahead.
Okay. The SEVA's over; they're crawling back in to button up the LM, for your information. Also, we're contemplating another VHF comm check on the next rev. It will occur around 108:32, at the time you come over the LM horizon, and probably interfere with your photo of the Caucasus Mountains. We'll have more procedures after AOS. Over.
Okay, Gordo. Sounds fine.
Endeavour, Houston, we're about to LOS, so see you next time around.
Okay, Gordo. See you on the other side.
Roger.
Endeavour, this is Houston. Over.
Hello, Houston; Endeavour.
Okay, Endeavour...
Hello, Houston; Endeavour.
Roger, Endeavour; this is Houston. We're going to run the comm check coming up here, but we'd like to go ahead and get the - the procedures in the Flight Plan as we go, and I'll give you a hack before the Pan Camera start time. The Pan Camera status, by the way, is running about 70 per cent okay; getting about 70 percent good pictures, and we're going to use nominal procedures. Over.
Okay, Gordo. Understand.
Also, Al, your orbit's looking good. It's performing - or behaving - as the FIDOs expected. Over.
Rog. Understand.
When you have a free moment, Al, let me know and I'll give you the switch positions to get set up for the comm check.
Okay, Gordo. Stand by just one, please. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston; Endeavour. Go ahead.
Okay, Al. You can go ahead and throw these switches as I call them out to you. Put VHF AM A to Simplex and the VHF Antenna to Right. Over.
Okay. Understand VHF A, Simplex, and Antenna, Right.
Okay. And then check on whatever audio panel you're using, probably 9, that VHF AM T/R is in T/R.
Roger. That's verified.
Okay. That's all there is until about 108:32, at which time I'll call you. And then anytime in about a 12-minute band there you can initiate a VHF comm check when it doesn't interfere with the photo target there.
Okay.
I'll give you a [time] hack when you're within range of the LM.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, Houston. Reminder: about - slightly less than 4 minutes now to T-start for the Pan Camera.
Roger, Houston.
Houston, Endeavour. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, Houston. Did you call?
Rog, Houston. Just reporting that the Gamma-ray boom retract time was 3 plus 07.
Roger; 3 plus 07.
Endeavour, Houston. Don't bother to acknowledge; 15 seconds to Pan Camera T-start.
Endeavour, Houston. Would you verify that the Mapping Camera Image Motion switch was to Increase? Over.
Ah, Houston, Endeavour. That's verified.
Okay. You got it a couple of minutes ago, is that right?
Yeah, that's right, Gordo. At 21 [minutes after 108 hours GET].
Okay, fine. It looked funny on the data here. I'll check.
Houston, Endeavour.
Endeavour, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Houston. Gordo, I'm just coming up over le Monnier now. Heading towards Serenitatis, and [I] finished that photo strip from Peirce to le Monnier. You might tell the King that the strip looks pretty good. I got some convergent stereo on Römer on the way over. And right now, I'm directly above one of the Littrow ridges, and it's - it has quite distinct relief. I'm really surprised at the amount of relief that the ridge has from here, and I won't take a picture it, because we got a couple yesterday. But it's really quite distinct. And I can look out to the north and look at Posidonius. And there's a very - along the - the narrow portion of what looks like the - the lakebed part of the fill in the mare floor, it looks very similar to what you'd see on a lake shore. Very distinctive color, light color on the bank, and a darker color in the mare floor, and what looks like some very positive relief, almost as if there was a lava flow that came out around the edge of the slab that was tilted and flowed down into the low spot of the floor.
Okay, Al. Very interesting. Change the subject, we're now - should be - within line of sight of the LM, so stand by while I get a quick check and see if they can take a comm check.
Okay; fine.
[To Scott on the LM circuit] Stand by for a call from Al if you could, guys.
Rog.
[To Worden] Al, go ahead with it and see if you can raise them.
Okay. Hey, Falcon; this is Endeavour. How do you read? [No answer.]
Hello, Falcon; this is Endeavour. [No answer.]
[To Scott on the LM circuit] Falcon, would you give Endeavour a call?...
Hello, Falcon; Endeavour.
...He's been calling you. Evidently you don't read. Try it in the reverse.
Hello, Endeavour. This is the Falcon. How do you read? [No answer; Pause.]
Falcon and Endeavour, this is Houston. Evidently, neither of you are reading each other. We'll stand by 'til we get overhead and give it another try. I'll give you a cue. Over.
Okay, Gordo. I'll keep trying here, a couple times. Falcon, Endeavour. How do you read? [No answer.]
[Responding to Fullerton] Falcon. Rog.
And, Falcon; this is Houston...
Hey, I hear you're trying to call. Go ahead. [No answer.]
Hey, Falcon, Endeavour. How do you read? [No answer.]
Hello, Falcon; this is Endeavour. I read you. [No answer.]
Hello, Falcon; Endeavour.
Hey, you're coming in five square, David. How'd it go?
Hey, it was super, just super. And we got the greatest place on the Moon down here.
Hey, that sounds neat. I think I got you on the - on the last pass, too.
Yeah, that's what they tell me. Say, can you see Index very well up there?
Yes, sir. I could see Index just as clear as a bell.
[Garble] Falcon to go with it?
I went right down the line: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Index.
Rog.
How do you read now, Dave?
All broken. How us?
Okay, let me try another antenna.
Okay.
Okay; how do you read now?
Okay; that's a lot better.
Okay.
I've got a question for you here...
Gee! That sure is a pretty sight down there, pal...
...Can you see Index at altitude now? Could you see any shadows to identify it?
Say again, Dave.
Could you identify Index Crater as you go over the landing site, now?
Yeah, I can do that with naked eye right now. I'm just coming up on you now, and I can see Index from here.
Hey, Houston; Falcon. Stand by [until the conversation with Endeavour is finished].
Okay, Endeavour; Falcon. I guess you're over the hill, because we don't read you now.
Hey, negative, negative. I'm just coming up on you.
Oh, okay. You're broken a little bit. As you go by, see if you see any shadows in Index. I never saw it on way in.
Hey, listen. I've got Index with just looking out the side hatch window, right now. Those four craters ending in Index are just as clear as a bell right now.
Okay. Do you see us sort of relative to Index?
Well, I did, yes. I can't see you now, but on the last pass I picked you up, and you're just to the north and a little bit west of Index.
Okay, I think that's about right. Yes.
Yeah. Did you get the coordinates off the map?
Yeah, we got the ones you passed to Houston, and we also got the ones in the back room, and I guess we're discussing several kind of numbers now within 100 meters or so of where we really are. So, I think we're pretty well located. [Pause.]
Well, I'm right over you right now, pal, looking down. [Pause.]
I hope the view is as fantastic down there as it is up here.
I'm telling you, it really is!
Well, we'll do the little things and you do the big things.
Yes, sirree. [Pause.] Maybe we can get together and compare notes.
Okay, we're about ready to power down for the night, and everything's in good shape down here. Everything's running well. And all we got to do is get a little sleep and get out after it.
Okay, David. See you in the morning.
Okay. Have a nice night. [Pause.]
Good night, Al.
Good night, James. [Pause.] I'm keeping your sleeping bag warm for you, Jim.
Take care of everything up there.
Certainly. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, Houston. [No answer.]
Endeavour, Houston. [No answer.]
Endeavour, Houston. If you're reading, put the Pan Camera on Mono and also add...
Houston, Endeavour. [No answer.]
Hello, Houston; Endeavour.
Endeavour, Houston. Go ahead.
Hey, Houston; Falcon. Endeavour's calling you.
Thank you, Dave. We're hearing him. [Pause.]
Endeavour, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
What is it? Shift change, Joe?
Al, no, it's not. I think we may be on split S-band, and you're transmitting to me instead of Gordo. What can I do for you?
Well, I didn't change my frequency, Joe. Say listen, I had a photo pass just coming up on the landing site that time. It was photo target 25, Caucasus Mountains, which I skipped to do the VHF Voice Check. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, this is Houston. Over.
Hello, Houston; Endeavour.
Okay, you've been loud and clear. We've been balled up on a site configuration problem here, but I think we're back with it, and we have one question. You're by T-stop for the Pan Camera now, we wondered if you went to Mono on the Pan Camera at 3 minutes and 20 seconds before T-stop. Over.
Negative, Gordo. I got tied up in that VHF check.
Roger.
Want me to go Mono now [on the Panoramic Camera]?
Go [to] Standby now, Al. We're past the T-stop time. [Pause.]
Okay, Gordo. Sorry about that. We're in Standby now.
No problem. That was our fault for the comm problem. We - we heard the comm checks and it sounded good. You're clear to go back to normal configuration on the VHF whenever you get a chance.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, Houston. We'd like the Gamma-ray, Gain Step switch one step up. Over.
Roger. Gamma-ray Gain Step, one step up, now.
Okay, Al. Thank you.
Okay. And if you want to let me know on the Pan Camera power; whether the lens is in or not.
Okay. The lens is tucked in...
Yes, just keep waiting.
...and your cleared to turn it off.
Okay, and the Gamma-ray boom is going out now.
Okay.
Mark. Barber pole. [Pause.]
And the Mass Spec. boom is going out.
Roger.
Mark. Barber pole.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, Houston. Would you give us Auto on High Gain [Antenna], please?
Roger. Auto on the High Gain.
Endeavour, this is Houston. 30 seconds to T-stop on the Mapping Camera. Over.
Okay, Gordo. Thank you. Got you.
Endeavour, Houston. I have the TEI-26 PAD for you. Over.
Okay, Houston. Stand by just one.
Okay: standing by. [Long pause.]
Okay, Gordon. I'm ready to copy.
Okay. TEI-26: SPS/G&N; Noun 47 is 37354; plus 0.60, plus 0.97; TIG is 129:22:25.54; Noun 81 is plus 3031.2, minus 1327.1, minus 0308.7; attitude is 180, 092, 339; ullage is four jets for 12 seconds. And other remarks: Lambda at TIG equal plus 172.93. Go ahead.
Okay. TEI-26: SPS/G&N; 37354; plus 0.60, plus 0.97; 129:22:25.54; plus 3031.2, minus 1327.1, minus 0308.7; 180, 092, 339. That's four jets for 12 seconds and Lambda at TIG is plus 172.93.
Okay, Al. Your readback is correct, and another comment. I think earlier we led you to believe that you shouldn't use the systems test meter. We retract that. We think the system - systems text - test meter is okay, and use it anytime you feel the desire to. Over.
Oh, okay. Fine. Thank you.
And we're still missing the deploy time on the booms there back earlier. If you've got them written down and you want to get on, just give them to us anytime you have time.
Okay. I'll - Let me dig for them. Gordo, on these boom deploy times and retract times, I don't have all of those times each time I do it, precisely, because sometimes it happens that I'm off busy doing something else, and I - you know, I miss the barber pole, so I - I don't have all of them.
Okay. I'm sure it's not a matter of life or death.
Houston, Endeavour.
Good - Go, Al.
Okay. Did you get the gyro torquing angles on that P52, Gordo?
That's affirmative. We got them.
Okay. I torqued them out at 109:07.
Roger; 109:07; and, for your information, there's one minute now until all those items on the SIM bay there is coming up.
Okay.
Endeavour, Houston. Over.
Houston, Endeavour. Go ahead.
A couple of requests - for you here. We would, first of all, like the Mass Spectrometer Discriminator switch to Low. Over.
Okay. The Mass Spec. Discriminator's in Low.
And we're ready for an E-Mod, and we'd also like to ask you for a crew status report. Over.
Okay. The E-Mod's coming your way, and stand by a minute and I'll give you all the status.
Okay. [Pause.]
I guess just - if you want just crew status report - doing just fine. I don't know what else you can say.
Can you give us how much sleep you got last night, and also your PRD read-out.
Okay. I've got apparently a bad PRD, so I haven't been keeping track, but I will if you want. But I've got Dave's PRD. And, let's see, I guess you didn't get a status report this morning. I got - I think all three of us got seven and a half hours of sleep last night, and I got mine all in one segment. And I've taken no medication today.
Okay, Al. Fine. That - that was the problem; we didn't get this morning's report. One other quickie. If you'll comment if we're throwing too many reminders up from the ground here or not enough. We're just trying to get a feel for whether we're harassing you or helping you - on the timing callouts.
Gordo, I think - Yeah, yeah. I think if you don't expect me to answer, it's a great help to me, because I do find that I'm trying to be three places at once in here; and, if I'm doing a P52, I can't be over working the - the SIM bay at the same time. So the reminder is good. I can always break into a P52 to go turn something off, but bearing in mind that I don't have a mission timer in - in the Lower Equipment Bay, it's a little difficult for me to keep track of the time sometimes, so I do appreciate it.
Okay. We'll keep them coming. If they, at any time, become too much, just shut us up.
Okay, Gordo. Appreciate it. Thank you, sir.
Endeavour, Houston. We got about 2 minutes until LOS. We still need the onboard readings, but if they were all nominal, just say so, and we'll get them some time later. And that's about all we have for you until tomorrow morning. Over.
Okay. Onboard read-outs: Bat[tery] C was 37 [volts]; Pyro Bat A was 37; Pyro Bat B, 37; RCS Alpha was 73 [percent]; Bravo, 71; Charlie, 72; and Delta, 73.
Okay. We copy all that. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, Houston. One last thing. The INCO's [Instrumentation and Communication Officer] running behind on his DSE rewind; if it's not rewound when you LOS, you'll have to do those - perform all those verifies yourself. Over.
Okay, Gordo. Will do it.
Endeavour, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Endeavour, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Endeavour, Houston. Over. [Long pause.]
Hello, Houston, Endeavour.
Roger, Al. Sorry to wake you up again, but we need Reacquire and Narrow with angles of Pitch, plus 25; Yaw, 185. Over.
Okay, Houston. You've got Reacq, Narrow; Pitch, plus 25; and a Yaw of minus 185. How do you read?
Roger. Read you much better now, Al. Sorry about that. Good night, again.
That's okay. I wasn't asleep yet. I was waiting for you to call.
Oh, okay. Anything else you want to tell us?
No. I was just wondering what you wanted setting on the - on the High Gain is all.
Okay.
Okay, Al. And one other thing you might do before you go to bed is Mass Spec. Discriminator to Low.
Ok - Okay, Bob; understand. Mass Spec. Discriminator to Low.
Roger.
