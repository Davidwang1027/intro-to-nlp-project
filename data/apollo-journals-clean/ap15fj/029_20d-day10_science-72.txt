Well, I can do it. But...
But my needles are not close to center. The needles are not very close to center.
I can't hear you.
You can't hear me?
No.
Well, you're not on comm. Yes.
We're off about - 20 degrees in pitch.
Enter.
As soon as you get the 50 18, you hit the Enter.
Yes.
Now..
What?
I can't hear you. Can you get Squelch, Enable On? There's so much noise in the S-band. I can't hear anything. Yes, I can hear you now.
Why'd they tell us to Pro, then? That wasn't the right thing to do, was it?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, we had a 50 18 - flashing. But we'd already gone past the 10 degrees, apparently. And they told us to Pro.
Yes.
Dave, if you want to put this away, you can. It'd be down in - in R-13, in the camera compartment on that side. There's a bag there - you know, the mag bags from the LM.
No, let's see. Okay, yes. Right in there. See that mag bag with six in it?
right in there.
No. We have B and A, and - and that one, and there's another one that was good in there.
The others just won't drive.
Not bad. Did real well, Dave.
I'd better be watching the Flight Plan for this page, because there are a lot of little notes I put in there that...
Kind of hard to understand, yes.
Need it now?
Think you can tomorrow? Think you tomorrow?
That won't be hard to do.
A little tennis.
I'm going to be worried, too, if I don't have that FCS on. I should say the FCS -. Should say the FCS. All day, Al. We'll be in those suits and won't be able to take a crap.
Okay..
I'll look it up there. The menu today - Today is...
We're ready to.
We have turkey and gravy, wet pack. Cranberry - orange - pineapple fruit cake. Vanilla pudding, which we had yesterday. And citrus beverage.
Okay. down below.
Yes. I can cut, if you want to put water in them.
don't see why camera for terminator photos.
Okay.
shave.
Is it?.
wet pack, turkey and gravy.
minus 5.
Okay. We need Gamma-Ray, Boom, Retract.
After about 3 minutes 15 seconds, it should be gray, and then we'll turn it off.
Jim. one whole week.
I'll take the cheese.
all right.
No. No. I - there'll be plenty of time for canned.
No. No, this tube was good.
camera went out right, Al?
Mapping camera.
Y'all want to try the tube?
Mapping Camera right now..
Hope so.
One minute to terminator photos, Dave.
15, 19.
How long?
One minute and 40 seconds.
Something on my window. I don't know why they put...
Al, would you turn the Laser Altimeter, On? Laser Altimeter, On.
And Mapping Camera, Image Motion, On. Barber pole plus 4. Yes.
No, I just want it On now. They don't want it - don't want it - you to do that until after you turn it On.
Yes, but it doesn't say Image Motion, Increase, until after we turn it on - turn the Mapping Camera, On.
Okay, Al. If you'll turn the Mapping Camera, On. Yes.
want?
And Image Motion, Increase to barber pole plus 4.
Yes.
See that crater out there - I don't know whether you can see it out your window, Dave. The one I mentioned looked like it had a contact right through it; one half of it was gray and the other half was white.
It's right out here. Just east of - that good Russian crater, Svodska - Sovolska.
it's a Russian crater.
Sbodska.
Sklodowska.
Sklodowska.
Yes.
Okay, we're supposed to configure the DSE. Stop, Command Reset, and Rewind.
All right.
It's on the - the Rewind, right - the Record.
Hello, Endeavour; this is Houston.
Hello, Houston; this is Endeavour.
Roger, Dave. Looking downstream a little bit here, I know you'll be interested to know that both the shape burn and the satellite jett will be coming up very close to the nominal times in your Flight Plan. And we've got the photo PADs here when you're ready to copy, and there are only a few lines. Over.
Okay, Joe. Go ahead.
Roger. The first is a terminator photo PAD to go in at 220 plus 05; and it reads T-start, 220 plus 13 plus 45. Over.
Roger, Joe. T-start, 220:13:45.
Thank you, Jim. And I've got a milestone for you to add here - a Pan Camera photo PAD, with a T-start of 220 plus 15 plus 25. And the instructions on that are: "Run the Pan Camera to film depletion." And your indication is talkback barber pole. That's a lot of feet of film. And finally an entry at 221 plus 59 - it's an addition which reads "circuit breaker O2 Tank 100W Heaters, three, Main B, Closed". Over.
Okay; on the last one, it was 221:59, "circuit breaker O2 Heaters - 100 watt Heaters, three, Main B, Closed". And then going back to the entry for a - a T-start time of the Pan Camera of 220:15:25, and run the camera to film depletion, and it'll be talkback barber pole.
Right on, Jim. Thank you.
Endeavour, this is Houston requesting Image Motion to talkback plus 3.
That's in work right now, Joe.
Okay; thank you. And if you give us Accept, we'll update a REFSMMAT to you.
And, Endeavour; Houston again with a couple more items.
Go ahead, Joe.
Rog, Jim. Coming up on our TEC partial Gamma-ray extension, and looking downstream towards that, we are requesting that you time the Gamma-ray boom extension, which you're going to do at 219 plus 19 - and we'll be standing by for that time. And also requesting - that you get on the biomed via the Flight Plan, please.
Okay.
And, Endeavour, it's your computer.
Endeavour, please terminate battery Bravo charge.
Roger. Battery Bravo terminating.
Except we were charging battery Alpha.
We copy that, Dave, and agree with it. Thank you.
Roger. It's terminated.
And you have - you've got a gotcha on the gentleman sitting next to me.
Ought to hit one once in a while.
Endeavour, Houston. Turn the Map Camera back On, please. And it's not necessary to extend it.
Rog.
Hello, Endeavour. This is Houston.
Go ahead.
Rog, troops. We'd like to tag up with you on the recommended TEI procedures. And, Al, I guess maybe you'll be doing this. And we - we're interested in reverifying the entries which you've made in your P40 SPS Thrusting Checklist, pages G5-1 through to the end. And we've got, I guess, two new entries to put in, but we want to reverify the entries that you've already got in there. Your choice, if you want to read those entries to us, or if you'd like to have us to read them to you. Over.
Okay. Let's get Al up on the headsets. Stand by one, please.
Roger.
Endeavour, Houston. Requesting Pan Camera Power, Off, please.
Rog. We're doing it right now.
Okay, Houston. We had a continuous barber pole on the Pan Camera there.
Roger. Copy that. That's a lot of film across those rollers.
Rog.
Endeavour, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. A question on your Pan Camera. When you turned the power off, was it already barber pole or was it gray and then went to barber pole as you threw the switch? Over.
It was already barber pole.
Okay, thank you. And we're standing by for Al on the headset.
Okay; let's - let us get all this SIM bay stuff cleaned up first.
Rog.
And, Endeavour; this is Houston. You're coming up on 8 minutes to LOS. And we'll just go over the TEI procedures on the next rev. No hurry on that at all.
Okay, that sounds like a good idea.
And, Houston. Gamma-ray Boom Deploy was 2 plus 33.
Say again that time, please?
2 minutes and 33 seconds.
Copy. Thank you.
And, Endeavour; this is Houston with instructions on the Pan Camera. You can start the Pan Camera power using the normal procedures at T-start. And if you get an incorrect indication, namely continuous barber pole, just leave it in the normal configuration until AOS. Over.
Roger. Understand. Start it normally at T-start, and if it is in barber pole, just leave it till AOS.
That's right; thank you.
And we have the torquing angles. Thank you.
Roger.
Good.
Got them?
Got them. Okay. Okay, and I'll go ahead and torque those out on the minute. Just give me a mark.
Okay.
Stand by, Al.
Okay.
Mark.
Okay, we'll just check it out here.
Endeavour, you're looking good at LOS minus 60 seconds. Configure the DSE for us, please. And we see you've done that. Thank you.
Roger. Just did it.
