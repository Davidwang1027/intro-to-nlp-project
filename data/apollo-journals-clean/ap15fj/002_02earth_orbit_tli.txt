The first Line Heater's On.
Okay. Have you got the torquing angle?
Mm-hum. Okay, we could do the SM RCS monitoring check and the CM...
Apollo 15, Houston through Canaries. Over.
Go ahead, Houston, 15.
Roger. You're loud and clear.
Okay. The S-IVB tank pressures are - about 41 on the oxidizer and about 21 on the fuel.
Roger; 41 and 21.
I know we're over the but Indian Ocean should be.
Okay.
And it looks like the S-IVB is tracking very nicely.
we were going so fast.
Huh?
I - I guess I hadn't really - hadn't - myself thought we wouldn't be - it wouldn't be visibly this fast.
Oh...
15, Houston. About 35 seconds to LOS, and we have nothing further for you. We'll see you at Carnarvon, as shown on the checklist, at 52. Over.
Okay. Carnarvon at 52.
Okay. I'm going to do a fuel cell purge check here, Dave.
Okay. Al, we'll put a...
Go ahead.
Huh?
Do you want to get - get going down there?
Yes.
Go slow.
Yes.
Try and clean some of this stuff off, too.
Ah, oh, eat it.
You can take mine and stick it in there, too.
Yes.
With that indicator out, I can't confirm an H2 purge on fuel cell 2.
Really?
Can't you get the - get the H2...
Caution and warning tone?
No, we don't get it.
Hmm.
Hmm. Better discuss that with them next time we...
Yes.
go by.
Well, shall we gently step along?
Yes.
Yes. Do you want R-12 out now, Jim? Anything Flight-Data-File-wise that you need now?
I don't need anything, Al.
Okay. I'm just going to stick these cards here in the compartment then, and...
Okay, Dave. Do you want to swing over and get the SM RCS monitoring check? Or do you want me to get that?
Oh, I can get it.
Here. I can just read it to you.
Shoot.
SM RCS Propellant talkback, eight, gray.
Eight, gray.
RCS Helium1 and 2...
Whoops, stand by; we got one - one barber pole right down - we got B Propellant - barber pole. That was probably a mistake. We open it, and it's gray.
You want to make a note?
Yes.
B Propellant...
B Secondary Propellant - B Sec Propellant was barber pole, and it reset to gray.
Okay. Okay. SM RCS Indicator, Helium Tank Temp.
Okay. Helium Tank Temp.
RCS Indicator selector to A through D. Give me Package Temp, Helium Pressure - all four.
Okay. Let me get calibrated here. You want - That's in temperatures only, huh?
No, I want Temp, Pressure, Pressure, and Helium Tank Temp.
Okay. 140, 4000, 200, 71.
Good.
150, 4000, 195, 70.
Good.
140, 4200, 195, 74.
Good. D.
D is 150, 4000, 190, and 72.
Okay, your Manifold Pressure's too low.
Say again?
The Manifold Pressure on D is a little low, about 2.
Oh.
Its lower - lower limit is, accord - 192.
Oh, okay, I'll give you one - Well, shoot,...
You can't read it. Okay. CM RCS monitoring check.
Okay.
CM RCS Propellant talkback, two, gray.
Two, gray.

Okay. CM 1 - I'm waiting - Okay, you want...
Helium Temp, Pressure and Manifold Pressure.
Okay. Helium Temp's about 70...
Good.
4000, and 95.
Okay, Helium should be 4100 to 4200.
Okay, it's right on 4000.
Okay. Okay. For 2?
Two; I'm looking at 70, 4000, and about 90.
Okay. Okay. I'm going to do a Caution and Warning operational check here.
Okay.
We're going to get a Master Alarm here.
Okay, let me check.
Okay, you're down in the LEB, Al?
Yes.
Get those...
Okay, can you get the strut unlocked while you're getting those?
I'm getting them right - I'm getting them right now.
Okay.
That was a fantastic ride!
I'm just now beginning to understand what went on.
Yes, boy.
That S-IC really does shake!
Yes.
Are you still working on that, Al?
Got the lanyard low - stowed.
Okay. Drinking Water Supply valve, On.
Okay. See if I can get to it here.
Quit having a good time and go to work.
Okay, it's On.
Okay. CB: COAS/Tunnel Lighting, Main B, closed.
Get your big foot out of the way.
Push me down.
I did. Okay. It's closed.
Okay. Unstow helmet bags, accessory bags, and tool E.
Okay. David, the helmet bags - Let's see, they're behind you, aren't they?
Yes, they're - I got to get those stupid things.
They're in U-4 - or U-1. Tool E is in L-2.
Yes. I'll get it. I don't know what this little thing is here,.
Okay, I'm going to switch around and get that window cover.
Okay. Let's see, where the heck is tool E?. Here it is.
I didn't see the - the decal on the light over here.
On the light?
Yes. "This vehicle will not be placed in motion until all seat belts are properly fastened. By order of the Chief of Staff, USAF."
Oh, you didn't see that?
No.
It would sure be easy to knock some switches here.
Yes. It sure would be. Okay, that's a thing we got to watch pretty close, huh?
Yes.
I - I might get you to get that window shade, Al, if - if you have a chance.
Oh, it's in the...
I know where it is - it's just hard for me to get over to one of them - below it...
I'll get it. Yes.
Is it in with the other window shade?
Yes.
Yes.
I can get it, it's right in here.
We want to put that in here so we don't get sunburned.
Good boy.
Give us the Lexan.
Yes.
Okay, there's tool E.
Now, let's see. You want to do that Emergency Cabin Pressure thing?
Yes, let me - I've got a - I'm confirming normal suit and cabin pressure.
Okay.
Here's your Lexan, Jim.
Okay.
Got it?
Be very careful of that Lexan, because I - I'm going to need to take some pictures through it.
Yes, okay.
Make sure you get everything tied down when you get through using it, because we got one more little g-level thing to go through here.
Yes, right.
Okay. Helmets and access - helmet bags and accessory bags.
Right here.
Okay. The Lexan shade is on.
And grab the TSBs while you're there, too. Dave.
Okay.
Okay, Jim. I guess we could do the...
Where are the TSBs, Al? They're not up here. They're down in one of those other things.
Must be in U-1.
Really?
Yes.
In U-1 - I was looking in U-2?
Oh, okay.
Let's see. The O2 flow is high.
What's the cabin pressure...
Oh, it - it just dropped down.
Yes. Okay.
What's - what's the cabin pressure? We still got the waste stowage vent...
Yes. It's.
It's 6.
Well, it was just high for a little bit.
Yes.
Okay. Cabin Pressure - Emergency Cabin Pressure valve to Both, Al.
Okay. Emergency Cabin Pressure going to Both.
And Suit Circuit Return Value, Open, Dave.
Yes, sir. It's open.
Okay. We can - I got the window cover on. We can remove helmet and gloves and stow in PGA bag.
Don't we - don't we do a check first?
No, we don't. That Main Reg check's on the next page.
Well...
As long as you're in position though, Al, let's do it.
Yes.
Let's do it.
Okay. Main Reg B valve, closed.

Yes.
Okay. Let's get into our little home. Shall we do it?
The accessory bags inside here, Dave?
Yes.
Let's see, you're C.
Okay, thank you.
And let's see what kind of label you got on yours today. Jim, you got an R - for you today.
R, okay.
R, C, and L. Guess we can keep track of that.
It's so pretty out here, Dave, I'd almost settle for an Earth-orbit mission.
Don't you say that.
Well, you'll get one, maybe someday. Who knows?
Boy. Sure doesn't take much to scratch these helmets.
No. Sure doesn't.
Oh, it's quiet.
Sure is.
Let's see, what have we got going, just the suit fans?
It's so quiet, it's kind of eerie...
Yes.
Almost like a space flight.
Okay. We got to snap these things.
Yes. We're supposed to try to keep them up there where we can get them.
You give me a hand here, will you?
Yes, we'll give you one.
onboard.
convenient place.
Yes.
You want to them all?
I guess...
all put them up.
I'll never do this again.
I'll bet you would.
Oh, what a joy! Oh, what a joy!
You don't to mind it.
What a joy! Too much.
Let's see. If you're going to do that, hand me the checklist...
Okay. What do we - what do we need, Dave? Why don't you read it out to me now?.

Now - do you want to get the Hasselblad out?
Oh, yes. Yes, we want...
It's got a mag.
Well, better cross it out..
Mag M. Oh, it is crossed out?
EL. Oh, okay. Spotmeter. Stow in the LMP TSB. I guess you better get the TSBs out...
Yes.
And the TSBs are up behind Jim.
Yes. Yes. They're behind you, Jim.
What, the TSBs?
Yes.
Up over here?
Guess that's all we need out of here for now..
Boy, you really get a Coriolis effect by looking at that in here.
Yes; that's why I say, just go slow, because it will all go away here in a few hours. Won't even notice it....
always felt we'd parted some company, didn't you?
Yes.
No, but it's nice to just go slow.
Yes. Oh, yes, it's...
Are you ready for some TSBs?
Yes, you need yours most of all.
I - I need mine?
Yes, because you need to put these two cameras in it.
Okay.
Okay. You want to hand me the camera, Al?
Okay, Jim, that's the - Yes, here you go.

Yes, sir.
Okay. If you'll - put the Secondary Glycol To Rad valve, Normal, for 30 seconds.
Have, you got tool E?
Yes. Yes, it's right up in front of you there, Dave.
Oh, thank you. Jimmy? Can you reach here?
No. And it's starting to get dark.
Really? I've got to get going on the P52.
Yes.
Okay. I can't get that, Jim, until Al closes the door there.
Yes; okay.
I'll do this ECS Postinsertion Configuration.
Okay.
Okay. Glycol Reservoir Bypass valve to Open.
Okay, Open.

Yes.
Okay, put it On.
Here, Jim, can you reach the cable?.
Yes. I've got it now.
Okay.
You working on that one, Dave?
Sure am.
Can you get to it there, Dave?
Haven't yet; No. Can you get to it?
Well, what do you need? Primary Accum?
Yes.
Yes, sure. Which way do you want it?
Well, it was the Primary Accumulator Fill valve...
Primary Accumulator Fill; okay.
Put it On. I'll tell when to - put it back...
Turn it On?
Okay...
It's On.
you can turn it back Off.
Okay, it's Off. Is that all?
Yes. Why don't you get the secondary while you're there? Jim, do you have that?
Yes. Secondary Glycol To Rad valve, Normal, Al, if you're in that position. Let me know when you - when you get it in Normal.
Yes, I can't quite reach that.
Okay.
Can you get it there, or...
Yes.
If you'll wait a minute, I'll be able to get it.
I can get it. Thank you.
Okay.
Let me know when you get it to Normal.
Okay, going Normal now, Jim.
Okay.
It's in Normal.
Okay, Jim. Here are the lines to the TV.
Wish I had a place to set that thing.
Yes..
Okay. the monitor.
Okay. How long you want this thing in Normal?
Oh, I'll give you a hack here.
Oh.
Okay...
Mark. It's - Secondary, looks okay.
Okay, I'm back to Bypass.
Okay.
Is that right?
Right. Bypass.
Dave, can I hand you the monitor over there?
What - Oh, yes...
For the TV.
Let me - Let's see, I got ECS Rad Flow Control to Power; Prim Glycol To Rad valve, Normal.

Okay.
Give you this monitor, Dave.
Okay.
What else you got on there, Jim? Oh, the TSBs.
Yes, do you want a TSB?
Yes.
I'll get them out. Do you want to put one up on the...
That'll do....
Down there, Al. You...
Okay.
Okay. I've got an EPS monitoring check here; secondary glycol loop check, and we've got the cameras out already.
Al, you want to check that?
I'm going to go through a secondary glycol loop check here.
Okay.
Hey, Al?
Yes.
See that little - see that funny little switch they put on here?
Oh, really?
It came off.
How about...
Well...
I've got a pocket down here.
I got a pocket, no sweat, I just don't want to forget it and have it floating around.
Yes.
Secondary Glycol Pump...
Okay. Optics eyepieces are in, G/N Optics Power going on. Optics Zero, Off, then Zero. Okay.
Okay, that's 15 seconds. The Optics Zero, Off - Mode, Manual.. Here we go.
Hallelujah!
Getting stars?
Yes, sir!
Oh, okay.
Whoops. A good mark there.
Okay.
Who gave you permission to write out here?.
Okay..
Yes. That's true. Oh, dear..
Okay. Okay, old PICAPAR, let's see what you can do.
Okay; 33. Antares.. Okay. And.
Boy, at night, you might - might as well be in the simulator.
Yes, except for the physiological change.
Yes. Okay, the EPS monitoring check is complete, Dave.
Okay.
Except for the battery relay bus read-out down there in Systems Test meter 5-B.
You can pick that up.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay. It doesn't look too good down in there.
EPS monitoring check now.
Okay. Did - did you do your fuel cell purge
No, I couldn't do the H2.
Oh.
Double check. Forty-one. Okay, Dabih.
Forty-one, right.
Five in..
Forty-one is what?
Dabih.
Dabih. okay?
Yes. I got it.
Okay, EPS monitoring check's complete.
Okay. Let's see how we did.
Well, pretty good.
all four.
About another 3 minutes for AOS,
Okay. I'll tell you what I'd like to do here the pass.
Do?
Check out the RCS real quick.
Here's the torquing angles, David.
Okay..
Go back to zero, and I think I have to get the optics back out. Right? Did you stow the optics, Jim?
Okay. Here, do you want to torque at 40? What do we torque at rendezvous?
Yes, did - did you stow the optics eyepiece, Jim?
Should we torque about 50?
Yes.
Okay. Good deal.
Okay. You got the numbers written down?
Yes.
Very good, Dave.
Okay.
Very good.
Okay, Al, and you might - Why don't you come up here and let me show you what the jets look like when we fire the.
Oh, okay. Yes. Let me - let me check out a quick star here.
Well, we got to do - I want to do this before AOS.
Okay.
Well, let me climb up here..
Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. It's - it's good.
Yes. I.
Yes.
Well...
Okay. You can probably look out my window.
Oh, yes. Very good...
I lost my watch.
Jim, you got my...
Yes.
stopwatch?
I'm looking for one.
Did you see that?
Yes, I saw a flash.
Saw a flash? You did? Couldn't hear it - I didn't hear it. Huh, I'll be darned!
Could sure see a flash.
Yes. Saw a flash, but I didn't hear it. Gosh, I used to hear them all the time. Huh!
You know, it's amazing what outside that window.
Well, yes...
That's because you got your lights on in here.
Yes.
Okay, here.
Okay, the secondary glycol loop check's complete.
Okay.
Apollo 15, Houston through Carnarvon. Over.
Rog. Houston, 15. You're loud and clear.
You're loud and clear also.
Okay the insertion checks are coming along very nicely. We're down through 21 in the checklist. And the cameras are out, and Al's completed his alignment.
Roger.
And I only got one comment Jim's got for you.
Go ahead.
Houston - Houston, 15. On the H2 purge, fuel cell 2, I cannot confirm since I had no - no read-out of a flow indication, or a caution and warning associated with that flow.
Roger.
And, if you'd like, I could do it any time, and perhaps you could confirm it.
Houston, fif...
This is Houston. We're unable to help you on confirming that purge down here, Jim.
Okay; understand.
Gordo, this is Al. I've got the numbers on the P52 for you.
Okay. Ready to copy.
Okay. used stars 33 and 41. Noun 05 was plus 000.01 and the torquing angles were minus 00.019, plus 00.021, minus 00.061, and they were torqued out at 50 minutes.
Roger. Copied. And the torquing angles are minus 00.019, plus 00.021, and a minus 00.061. Over.
That's affirm.
Thank you.
And, Houston, one other comment. Apparently sometime during launch, the RCS-B secondary propellant isolation valve closed, and we recycled it and got a gray talkback.
Roger, Dave.
We should have Mag...
Apollo 15, Houston. About 15 seconds to LOS. Estimating United States at 1:30.
Roger. 1:30.
Al, my doggone checklist says Mag M ought to be on here for the UV.
Mag N?
Mag M, man.
Yes, that's right...
Yes...
That - that...
has the color stuff there, too.
Oh.
take a picture...
Yes... better get two of these...
Davy?
Yes.
You want to put that on there?
monitor?
Yes.
Yes. I don't know what we're going to do with this thing. I guess Jim has to hold this during TLI. Or something like that.
Why - why can't I put it on the bracket?
You can.
Okay. Where's the bracket?
It's down in - A-1.
Okay.
Bracket's in A-1.
Okay... get it.
Man, that was some fantastic ride! Gaa!
Something you're not likely to forget for a while.
And when you get a chance, Al, I need the - the UV bracket.
Okay.
The UV bracket, and the UV..., and the UV lenses.
Yes.
Yes.
Am I supposed to be... you, Al?
No.
Okay.
Here's the UV lenses.
Here's the UV bracket.
Camera checkout. Can I have the... up here, Jim?
Yes.
Yes.
Okay, Al. Where'd it go? Let me trade you. Hold the lens for me. While you're holding the lens - If you'll hold that, I'll get you the bracket.
Okay. I'm holding it.
Okay... UV bracket.
Could you put this - here, I guess - can you put this lens away? Up there, or do you want me to keep it up here?
You'll - you'll need it if you take any color pictures... lots of... already. What's the matter, Davy?
(Laughter) You got to have the pyro arm circuit breakers in to turn the RCS command on.
How about that?
We're going to keep you honest.
Okay, where do you want it?
I'll take the...
Oh!
I'll take the lens now.
Hmm. Okay...
Okay, your pitch rate.
Why don't you...
Good...
Okay, pitch?
Yes. Pitch, roll; roll, pitch. Good...
Good.
And quad D going open.
Let me know when you all are...
in the way.
ready for your TSBs, and I'll hand them to you.
Okay. Hey, you can give me mine, Jim. He's taking yours.
Then when you get a change...
Okay,... TV bracket.
- you can give it back.
Okay, Al, here's your TSB.
Okay....
Dave, here's yours.
Gee, thanks a lot, Jim.
Any time.
but the University of Michigan was well represented.
Is that right? (Laughter)
Yes. Couple of little calling cards here.
You know, I keep going up to the top of the vehicle.
Well, that's a common phenomenon.
Up toward that hatch.
Everybody always has.
funny.
That's exactly right. We did that for 10 days and never figured out why.
Shoot!... somebody... this hatch...
Al, I'm going to give you the... to put back up there.
Okay.
So we don't lose track, here.
That's the name of the game for the next 12 days, gang. Put it back.
Okay. Let's see, Al. Do you have the...
What? The TV lens? Where's the TV?
Right on the couch.
back here and see if I can bump into it.
Okay.
Do you have the right settings on it? Want me to read them to you?
Yes, what are they?
I don't know why we've been putting that TV up so early_
Just to get it out of the way.
Okay. We want ALC to peak. And f/44.
Peak - and average.
ALC to peak.
No, wait a minute; f/44.
Yes.
Guess we - we might as well leave the - the lens cover on until we're ready to use it.
Dave, did you do - do that SCS attitude reference - reference check?
I'm doing it right now.
Okay.
Sunrise in about 16 minutes.
Okay, f-stop at 44, with about -...
Get the - judge that...
Okay.
ground direction.
f-stop, 30, and the focus at - at infinity...
That's right.
I'll take those. I guess it doesn't really matter...
Yes.
Okay, Jim, if you want to stick that in the -
back you up.
And I'll plug it in.
Okay. Attitude reference check.
Okay.
Hey, Jim. You got the SPS monitoring check all right? ECS monitoring check? EPS?
Yes. I've taken care of all those checks, Davy. come up to the - docking probe.
Yes.
After that SCS reference.
Okay, Jimmy, you're all hooked up.
Okay. If I can just get my bracket in here. Pointed in the right dir...
Do we need anything else out of A-1, before I close it?
When you get a chance, Al, out of R-12, I think I need that - probably need -.
Just like that cardboard - for the window.
You - you want - you want to pull R-12 out?
Yes, that whole brack - that temporary sto - that bracket? Yes. Yes, I think I'll probably stow the cardboard in there.
Okay. We really don't have a place to put this if you got the TV up.
That's what you got a Flight Plan volume for.
Whoops.
How you doing, Jim?
All right...
What do we have in there?
Flight Plan, Malfunctions, and all that jazz is in there.
Okay.
The card - is my cardboard window shade in there, or something else?
We didn't find it here.
Thank you.
Probably supposed to be with the cue cards.
Okay, I didn't find it.
I don't know. Our Flight Data File boxes up here, they're almost empty.
Maybe they just happened to fall open.
No, there's just very little in here.
That's all we need, is that Flight Plan. I talked to Ted Guillory all we really need. Up there is Volume I?
Yes. I've already all through these containers,
Oh.
Well, we got all our data - got all that...
It just doesn't take up a whole container. All those checklists...
There I need Mag N.
You need Mag N. (Cleared throat) Okay, coming up.
Where are the rest of the cue cards?
I think we got the in the pocket.
Do we?
Yes, I think so.
reversed hoses here...
Nmm, ORDEAL.
ORDEAL?
Yes, man. seems like it can be just a hell of a.
Well, don't hurry.
Yes, let me - get my coffee here.
Yes.
Did you finish that check, Dave?
Yes, the attitude reference check is complete.
Goddam.
The what?
the whole spacecraft.
Yes, the red one.
Here's Mag M, Jim.
Okay.
Okay, coming down to ORDEAL, David.
Oh! can't - we can't do this - I can see hoses.
Al, don't...
Okay, there we go, Dave.
No, that's all right.
I just got my hoses If you - if you can...
Yes, I can get it.
Dave. There we go.
Good. We got it.
Okay. Got it?
Yes. Thank you.
Need some help?
Okay.
Well, this is going to be a backroom brawl.
What?
It's always your fault, Dave.
Got to be.
But it's all of that?
get myself hooked up on everything here.
Hey, Al, if you get a chance on this - Did you find my cardboard window covering?
No.
Data Card Kit?
Which part of the Data Card Kit?
Well, I don't know. I don't know.
Here, let me look some more.
Yes. I don't even see where the cue-card part of the Data Card Kit is.
Uh-huh.
Data Card Kit.
Okay.
UV Card Book.
Okay. I guess I don't need it.
Okay.
Whoop!
Bet that ought to be.
Hey, you know, I got your meal, Al?
Do what?
chow.
Oh, yes. Yes.
Hey, I think I'm pretty well caught up with the UV photography here.
Good, Jim.
Getting around with the...
Goody, goody. Read over the procedures.
Want me to read them to you?
No, why don't you read them to yourself?
Well, that's what I'm doing.
Jim.
I - I - Did you get the - Oh, you're looking for the cue cards, is that right?
Yes, I'm just trying to get them all sorted out.
And...
Who has the tape?
Just a second, Jim, and I'll get it.
I can reach it. Have to push these back - Watch your foot!
Oh!
Man, you hit my foot; it really...
Did it really bug you?
Yes.
I don't think we need the Data Card Kit out right now.
May- maybe we could - Is there a good place to stow this down there?
Uh, I - I think you'd be better off if you stuck it right back in the window pouch, there.
Is this just for this pass, Jim?
Shade.
Yes.
Uh...
Are you going to...
Yes.
take it down?
I think - Yes, that's probably...
When?
that's probably true. The next pass is at about.
Yes, I'll have the cardboard up for it.
Yes.
I need the - probably the.
I guess we could put - we put that back up before we do TLI, don't we?
Yes.
You need what, Jim?
Yes...
Oh, look at the horizon.
Okay, you guys, let that thing be - let it be.
Oh, boy!
Come on up here and look at this. switches.
Okay; all right. All right, have you got - have you got This is unreal to watch.
You've got to watch this, boy. This is one of the beauties that few people ever...
Ah!
get to see.
Ooo!
Gaa.
Look at the clouds.
Yes.
Just watch it, there. Watch this for a few minutes...
Look at that. You can see lightning. Looks like streaks of lightning around there?
See the little light thing out there?
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes. I didn't see that.
I didn't either.
Ooo, like - Oh, that - that's fantastic.
That's a...
Yes.
That's a satellite.
Hey, you're right! That's got to be.
Yes.
Sure it's a sat - satellite, not a - a planet?
That's a satellite, Jim.
Well, look.
Come on. planets are like...
Son of a gun.
I'm backwards.
Huh, I guess it is a planet. It's sure bright, though, isn't it?
Yes rest.
It's sure bright, but it's a planet.
Is it going to be black like this all the way out?
Look at those clouds.
Yes.
Yes...
I've got something like.
see a damn thing.
No.
By golly, it's getting bright and early.
I've got 8. about like this.
That Earth is a big mother.
Yes, it looks pretty big, but I think it's probably going to be small.
Yes.
I hope it does.
Yes, that must be a planet, Dave, because...
You were right.
it's staying in inertial, and we're going Orb Rate now.
Boy! Get your sunglasses.
Yes, it's bright, isn't it?
Boy, oh, boy!
Yes.. Let's see, I'm going to start getting up around.
I don't think you can.
I can..
I hear you..
Too much trouble for me to get - for you to get.
Looks like Aquarius coming up back there.
Yes. How about your rendezvous window, Jim?
It's fine. Yes.
Okay. load it with.
Yes.
You think you need a there, Jim?
I've got it, man. It shouldn't.
I couldn't prove it to you.
Oh, I see.
Beautiful!
Check that.
I've got to get that to dock.
So you're going to.
Which reminds me, I've got my own docking checklist.
Oh, you did?
Got your?
What's the matter with this other one?
Well, the one - the one I found, it's the one that doesn't have any, you know, any references in it.
You never got the other one changed?
There ain't no way I could do that.
Okay.
okay.
We'll be watching you.
Hand controller, not a control. Okay.
Okay. Why don't the program?
What do we have to do?
Where are we stowing the tape?
Just... it.
We should be stowing it back where it goes.
Here's the tape, Al. Where are you putting it, down there?
Okay...
Well, we got 8 more minutes.
Are you ready for the UV, Jim?
Yes,... It says 1:35.
Yes.
I - I guess - I guess I might as well wait until then.
Yes, I think you should. Let's do everything right on the money.
The UV is on time...
Yes, sir.
When do we shut it off? Do you shut it off...?
Yes. I agree with you.
I just want to...
Do you want to wait until we get...
AOS before we do the docking probe, don't you?
Oh, I don't know.
(Cough)
Do you want to go through it now?
Yes, let's go through it.
Okay, CB Docking Probe, two, close. Two, verify.
Two, verify.
Docking Probe Extend/Release to Extend/Release until full probe extension.
Okay, ready.
Okay, here it goes. You've got it, man.
Yes.
Pretty good. Okay, got a barber pole to gray.
Okay. Docking Probe Extend/Release to Retract. Talkback gray.
Retract. Talkback gray.
Okay.
Okay, let's get... here.
There are a lot of clouds out there, huh?
Sure are...
Hey, Al, you got the - the Hasselblad down there?
Yes, it's in the TSB. The Hassel - Well, the Hasselblad's set up for the UV window.
Yes.
The spotmeter. Did you get...?
Yes.
Yes. Yes, it's...
Sure did.
The TV is all ready.
Yes.
the pad. You got your updates. Pyro Arm...
the TLI Prep Book.
Yes,...
Hey, now, do you have the TLI card in your pocket?
No, I have it.
No use in finding mine. I did look.
Okay.
It must be in my...
It must be in your...
Oh, yes? You get a better... (laughter).
You carried my lunch; I carried your card.
Did you really get it?
Sure.
S-IVB/TLI.
Yes, I...
Well, I got a... here... a little culture.
When we get past this cloud bank, I think I might take some of these UV pictures.
They want some clouds for the UV.
Yes, I know. But I didn't want...
Oh.
solid clouds.
What are you all looking at out there? Can you tell?
Oh.
You mean what part of the world?
No - about where the camera's pointing.... They didn't care what time, but we need to correlate it....
Hey, look. There's... out there, I think.
Where?
Huh?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Hey, man.
Can you see... over there?
Oh, that must be it.
Yes.
Man. That must be it.
I'll take some UV pictures of it.
Okay.
That's good, Jim. Good deal.
Except I don't think we know the right time...
Yes.
Oh, you can see some of that pattern...
far-reaching pattern.
Hey, yes. We know where it is.
Is that the right thing?
This thing is really, really weird.
I didn't even notice the S-IVB flashes, but you can see them now.
Yes. The S-IVB...
Yes, I noticed them.
Well, let's see. I guess somebody's got to be ready to copy pads.
Yes.
Jim, I guess you're going to be busy with
No, no, I'll be doing that. It won't take long to do this.
All right. I'll get the pyro arm check when we get the comm back.
Al, why don't you get the...?
Yes.
Why don't you get this thing...?
Okay.
Okay.
Do you - do you want me to the.
Yes. Yes, I've already scratched mine.
Get the quantity...
The glycol pump? Get the glycol pump?
Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
Hello, Houston, 15.
Would you put the - You're loud and clear, Dave. Would you put the IU Uptel to Accept, please?
IU Uptel, Accept.
Okay; we're going to update the IU Nav vector based on tracking at Carnarvon. We'll have you leave that in Accept all the way through the States pass. When we get a better track here across the States, we'll update it again - before the end. Over.
Okay; will do. And we're down through 27 on the checklist. The docking probe is out. Looks good. And standing by for a sequence arm and a logic check when you're ready.
Roger. We can do that now. Go ahead.
Okay. Logic one, On, now. Logic two, On, now.
Logics are good. You're Go for pyro arm.
Okay; and we had one other little one. At about an hour, we noticed that the primary and secondary propellant isolation valves on Quad Delta were barber pole. We cycled the switch, and they are now gray. And the RCS checks okay.
Roger. I have a TLI plus 90 and lift-off plus 8 abort PADs, when you're ready.
Can you stand by one, please, Gordo?
Okay.
Getting a little UV here.
Okay, Gordo. I'm ready for the TLI PAD.
Okay. This is the TLI plus 90 abort PAD, Jim.
Okay.

15, Houston.
Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
Apollo 15, Houston. We're not reading you. Over.
Okay, Houston; there is a breakup - breakup in the VHF, and Jim lost some of the first part of the transmission. Could you go through it again?
Okay, just what do you need?
We have Noun 47 through roll, pitch and yaw.
Okay, Jim. Noun 47 is 66938; minus 0.52, plus 1.90; Noun 33, 004:19:56.99; Noun 81, minus 0425.4, plus 0000.1, minus 4921.7 - correction on Delta-VZ is a plus 4921.7; roll, pitch, and yaw are 180, 166, 002. Go ahead.
Okay; readback: TLI plus 90, SPS/G&N; 66938; minus 0.52, plus 1.90; 004:19:56.99; minus 0425.4, plus 0000.1, plus 4921.7; 180, 166, 002; N/A, plus 0021.0; 4940.1, 6:34, 4920.8; 40, 079.5, 35.9; N/A, plus 16.04, minus 030.00; 1099.0, 34492; 017:43:58, Deneb and Vega; 112, 128, 356, and no ullage.
Okay, Jim, your readback's correct. Lift-off plus 8 PAD is 008:00, 6076, minus 175, 027:06. Go ahead.
Roger. 008:00, 6076, minus 175, and 027:06.
Roger. And I'll have the TLI PAD when you're ready for that one.
All right. Go ahead. I'm ready for the TLI PAD.
Okay. Time base 6 predict 2:40:23; attitude for TLI, 180, 045, 001; burn time 5:55; 10401.1, 35599; Sep attitude, 359, 077, 320; extraction attitude, 301, 257, 040. R2 align, 045.0, 038.0; ORDEAL start, 56:45; Yaw 001; ejection time 4:16:00. Go ahead.

Okay. A little static on two readbacks. Read back Yaw for extraction and R2 align, please?
Roger. 040 and 045.0.
Okay. Readback's correct, Jim.
15, Houston. We have a question regarding the primary and secondary isolation valve. Over.
Go ahead.
We're wondering if you happened to just notice them barber pole at one hour, or did you notice them close at one hour? Over.
Ah, no. We just noticed that they were closed at an hour, But apparently in the shuffle here, somebody probably bumped the one switch which would do it.
Roger. You don't - you can't tie them to any other action or event there then? Is that right?
Negative.
Okay; thank you.
Okay.
15, Houston. IU Uptel to Block? We have put in a second IU Nav vector, based on Stateside data.
Uptel to Block.
15, Houston. We'd like P00 and Accept.
P00 and Accept. You've got it.
15, Houston. IU Uptel to Block. You have a new state vector now.
Roger. CM Uptel going to Block.
Roger. My mistake. Also have a short update for your TLI checklist ORDEAL angles because of the slight performance difference in the S-IVB. Over.
Okay; go ahead, Gordo.
Okay. On the launch checklist, page L2-30, bottom of the page. Tell me when you have it.
Go ahead, Gordo.
At 56 minutes, slew FDAI number 1 to pitch equals 17 degrees rather than 16; and, at the top of the next page, ensure FDAI number 1 pitch equal 14 degrees rather than 13. Over.
Roger. Copied. 17 degrees instead of 16, and 14 instead of the 13.
Okay; then on the next page, 2-32 at 59:55, change 7 degrees to 8 degrees, ensure FDAI number 1 pitch equal 8 degrees.
Copy, 8 degrees.
One more on the cue card for TLI down slightly below the middle, the long cue card that the CDR uses at 54 minutes. The 24 degrees should be changed to 25 degrees. "Ordeal 300/Lunar, 25 degrees.
Okay, we've got that; 25 degrees.
And then there will be a 1 degree difference on the rest of the ORDEAL numbers.
Okay; looks like they all fit.
That's it.
Apollo 15, Houston. We're about to LOS. Nothing further. We'll see you at Carnarvon at 2:25 GET.
Ah, Roger. 2:25...
Inject.
Inject.
EDS Power, On, up.
Okay. Well, I checked the Delta-V on the EMS; and, I guess, you might as well just hold on until we get all the way around here - until we get the... again. There's nothing else really to do.
Okay. You got EDS Power, On, up?
No, hold...
You want me to hold off?
Yes.
Okay...
Really not much more to check. GDC align; I'll wait until we get a little bit farther down the road to do that.
Okay. Where is my kitchen timer, Al?
Down below. You want it?
Yes, I guess I ought to put it to use when I start cycling on the cryo fans here shortly. You know, we - actually, we have plenty of time. I could put that 105 lens on again and take a colored picture.
Yes.
Colored picture?...
there's a requirement to do it.
Yes.
- with the 105 lens.
Good idea, Why not do it?
It's - it's not the same place, but -
Yes, yes - Well, there's no - no - If you want to take a color picture, they - what they want is a color picture to back up the scene you're seeing in the UV. So, if you can't get a color picture of that area, there's no sense taking it. But you might go ahead and take some pictures with the 80 millimeter. There's nothing wrong with that. On the...
Have you got the Update Book out, Jim?
No, I don't.
Did you log - you didn't log the UV pictures in here, did you?
Yes.
Where did you log them?
Oh, on - in the photo procedures here...
No, we want to log them on the - on the...
Photo Log - 70 millimeter, Mag N, was it?
Yes, Mag N.
Ohh!...
(Laughter) Get the - get the... out.
(Laughter) Yes, I reckon. How's old Davy?
Oh, we're muttering along, flying across the sea.
Do you have yourself strapped in the seat there, Dave?
Yes. I do that most of the time, I think.
Yes, I like to do...
It's a lot more comfortable.... relative position.
Yes.
Because, otherwise, you're fighting the panel all the time.
Yes. My problem.
Why?
We could take these lifevests...
Yes, we could.
Should we stow the lifevests?
Yes.
Yes...
Get that in there somewhere?
Not nearly as loud at 5 psi.
Yes.
Get your lifevest put away, Jim?
Yes.
things on?
Okay.
Got your...?
Yes, I...
Can't get it quite as tight as...
Where would you keep the Update Book?
R-3 is a pretty handy place for all those books up there.
Do we have a strap?
Velcro...
Is there a snap up there?
No,...
I think I see it now.
Ah, it'll be dark pretty soon. We'll get to see the never-never land. There's no horizon.
We got to have some place to put the...
Well, we could unhook it. Maybe - -
Matter of fact, why don't we get everything stowed for TLI?... couple helmets - Why don't you put it down in the LEB somewhere, and we'll just leave them there until after TLI - -
The helmets?
Yes.
Yes.
Let's - let's just leave them until we get docked and start getting up into the tunnel...
Yes.
put them on.
Okay.
Could just stick these PGA bags in there.
Yes.
Whoops! Did I do it again?
I don't know, did you?
You're pretty consistent down there, Al.
I can't imagine you did that twice in a row.
Huh?
The emergency cabin regulator check book.
Huh?
Must have been.
We're getting a good check at that, Al.
Watch your big feet.
Are we going to eat before TLI?
You're kidding.
No,.
We need an emergency.
Sort of an early time.
Okay, give me your helmet back there, Dave, and I'll stash it away.
Okay.
Gets dark fast, doesn't it?
Yes, it does. Yes, you see never-never land out there?
Yes. No - no horizon at all.
Anything else you want?
No, that's all right.
Let's just take a look at this. Sort of interesting.
Yes.
What, that over there?
Boy, that's - Look at that planet, how orange it is out there, Dave? Directly ahead.
Yes, it is. isn't it? How come we saw the same planet in the sunlight, Jim? Huh? Tell me that.
It wasn't the same one.
Huh? Tell me that.
Oh, you're - you're still saying it's a satellite, huh?
Well, I - I don't know what I'm saying now, because you convinced me it's a planet. But now, it's in the same position it was...
Yes?
when we had sunrise as we go into sunset. So that tells me something.
Two hours 10 minutes and 7 seconds. Turn the lights out. never-never. Now I can put the COAS on it. And for the COAS,. It's right on it. It's depressed - just about 18 degrees.. Here we are. Here we are at Orb-rate. Time's going to be 10 - 2:10. Okay, I'm going to mark it.. Get a writing pad. Two hours and 11 minutes exactly.
Mark. Two hours and 11 minutes. COAS is on - 7 degrees depressed below our image - our attitude towards the Earth.
that flash out there.
Oh, that's the S-IVB.
the S-IVB.
Okay.
Well, you know, that's got to be Saturn. Saturn is over by Scorpio.
Yes, it could be.
Yes, and Antares.
Look at all the.
Al. The Earth?
Yes.
Okay, let's see. We got everything stowed now?
Anybody want to eat anything now?
I'm going to wait until we get everything squared away after docking.
docking.
What did you say?
Al. How about yours?
Okay. Is your suit dry today, Jim?
Well, you haven't smelled too much urine, have you?
No.
Okay, it must have worked then.
Good.
Well, I'll tell you, I used it three or four times. (laughter).
Did you really?
Yes. Three times before launch and once in orbit.
God, you really.
I really drank the Gatorade yesterday.
Twenty-six minutes to go before ignition.
Yes, I have ignition at 2:50:31.
You want to wait until we get AOS and then start through it?
We should have gotten.
What?
We changed.
We have?
Getting ready to go to sleep?
No, lot of work to do.
(Laughter) Yes. About time.
Yes, it is.
I've been feeling a little more full in the head all the time.
Yes.
And...
You mean it gets more and more?
Well, for - it's up - everybody's a little different. For me, it gets a little more and more after the first - like 7 or 8 hours. And then it stabilizes, and you don't even notice it after the first night. I didn't. Ever - everybody's a little different. Your - your body adjusts - adjusts to the whole thing.
feel tired quicker because we don't have anything to push against. Seems like...
No.
suddenly you don't have anything.
No, I didn't feel any muscle fatigue. Well, Jim, why don't we go through this thing now? We're going to be.

to put that on and watch it?
Mm-hmm.
Turn it?
Yes.
It looks to me like you could turn it first.
No, do it yourself. It's running...
Yes. Right on the money.
I just don't believe we're here.
Yes. It's the greatest, for sure.
That's for sure.
Yes.
You think we'll...?
It's not bad up here in zero-g either, is it?
No, hell no, it's not too bad at all.
Don't even feel supper.
Did you - did you this morning?
Yes.
I can't imagine why people - some people suffer.
Make sure you take your timer down, Jim, before we start the burn.
Ah...
How about putting it up in there? Okay. Set it right before...
As a matter of fact, get - get all that stuff secured. The S-IVB hasn't got much, but when we get down to the SPS stuff, why it's got a pretty good kick.
Yes.
Sure. Well, it ought to be all right on the girth shelf, won't it?
I guess.
Well, the seat's kind of tight right underneath there.
Huh?
Just passed through the...; we're in good shape.
Yes, should be right here.
There it is.
Yes.
Apollo 15, Houston through Carnarvon. Over.
All right, Houston; 15 here. 5 by.
You're 5 by also.
Okay.
Houston, 15. We're down to the middle of the TLI Prep, and everything's in order.
Roger.
15, Houston.
Houston, 15.
We're showing the Manual Attitude switches in Rate... in Min Impulse, and we recommend Rate Command.
Roger. Rate Command. And the pyros are armed.
Roger.
Apollo 15, Houston.
Houston, 15.
You are Go for TLI.
Roger. Go for TLI.
And the S-IVB oxidizer looks like about 36. The fuel looks like about 19.
Roger.
Function Delta-V is on.
Mm-hmm, Don't bump your head on those lights...
Yes, right.
Put your head back here in that little old cubbyhole.
Think that will help?
It might.
it's daylight. Think we can see this pretty burn?
Yes, I'm sure we will.
You ready?
Yes.
809... 58.
Sunrise at 2:48.

Okay. Launch Vehicle Guidance, IU.
Verified.
Okay. We're standing by for time base 6.
Okay.
What's EPS?
Burn time - 5:55. And, when you get the shutdown, you got a 2-second thruster VI. Right?
Right.
degrees per second rate. The first one is at 59. Make sure you got that. 45 degrees pitch and yaw.
That's 48 deg - degrees.
degrees per second roll. The S-IVB guidance function... Okay.
Do we have Hawaii all the way through the burn?
I don't think so.
No, we haven't.... No, we have...
AOS at 2:5...
We go through a keyhole...
LOS at...
No. We have LOS at 49:52 for... minutes.
No, we get them back at 2:55.
Ooh.
Yes, well, we tried it the other day.
Yes.
I hope so.
If you did, you can change your Delta-V... 20 feet per second.
There's ullage.
Yes.
I bet you it's from the S-IVB.
Huh?
You're running about an 80-amp load.
what that was?
We're down to 5 on the cabin.
Get that waste vent closed.
When do we close that?
When we get ready to dock, and the cabin's up to 5 pounds.
I thought we were supposed to leave some pressure for that.
I think we do.
Right after - -
Right after TLI?
Yes.
I think we do it.
Right after Waste Stowage Vent, Closed.
There's ARIA.
Keep - keep looking.
Apollo 15, this is Houston through ARIA. Over.
You don't have the S-band squelch on, do you?
Yes, yes, I thought it was...
we ought to be able to get that...
Oh, that's pretty - that is loud. Isn't it?
Yes.
Apollo 15, this is Houston through ARIA. Over.
Rog, Houston, 15. You're about 1 by 1 through ARIA.
Roger. You're about 3 by; clear enough to understand.
What'd he say?
He said we're clear enough..., I think.
Roger. We have somebody else on the loop with us, too.
Uplink Activity light.
Okay.
It's a familiar sound, and I can't remember what I - what it is.
Just a minute...
You can't change the frequency there. You might hook up...
It seems to...
It's a bull's-eye.
Why don't we hook up the speakers, and let's do some checking...
Don't count too far.
S-II Sep light.
Yes.
It just came on, Dave.
We have the S-II Sep light?
You stand...
Roger. Sep light.
Okay.
The Uplink Activity light went out.
Okay.
Okay. Monitor launch-vehicle tank-pressure sequence.
Very well. It should come on now. Come on, baby.
Here it comes. Come on.
It might fool you...
Yes.
And coming up on 52 minutes.
Okay. ORDEAL FDAI 1 to Orb-rate; 2 to Inertial.
Okay, stand by one.
Okay, Houston. It looks like we have a slow repress start. We're up to about 22 to 23 on the fuel pressure.
Okay; ORDEAL Mode, Hold/Fast.
Roger, Dave. You're just barely readable. Understand you're getting a normal Repress. We're - It looks good down here.
Hold/Fast. Go on.
All right.
Okay. Normal Repress.
Okay; 300 on the Lunar.
And RH...
Armed.
Uptelemetry, CM and IU, both to Block.
Block's on.
Standing by for 56 minutes.
At 54, we go 25 degrees.
What - what was that on repress that you... normal?
It's - it's just something that's a little slow in here.
Oh.
It's normally quite fast.... At 54 minutes, we want to be at 25 degrees.
Wonder who all that is?
Yes, I wonder?
Coming up on 55 minutes.
Okay. Coming up...
Okay; at 56, slew FDAI 1 to Pitch at 17.
Okay....
Seventeen.
Okay; at 56:45, it should be 14 degrees.
Apollo 15, Houston through ARIA number 2. Over.
talking to him.
This is 15. Say again.
We lost him, Dave.
15, Houston. You're way down in the static, but I can hear you transmit. Over.
Okay. We'll pick you up at the keyhole.
Yes, Operate/Slow.
What angle? 14 degrees?
Fourteen degrees.
Minus.
Daylight?
Yes.
Why don't they have a picture like that in the simulator?
Two hours and 48 minutes.
Blank....
TVC Servo - SCS TVC Servo Power 1 to AC 1/Main A.
Average g is on.
Two, off.
Roger. Average g.
Tape Recorder's going High Bit Rate.
Sep light.
Roger. Sep light.
Thrust mode, Normal.
Put it in between the camera, Al. No, don't force it.
Jim.
Can you get it up there?
Okay. Get ready, gang.
Okay, 8 seconds. Three.
Fire is on.
We have ignition.
Roger; ignition.
Okay. We're pitching now.
full, high.
15, Houston; we're showing good thrust.
Okay. Yes.
It's tracking's real good.
Load's about a half a g. ORDEAL... should be tracking with it.
Well, it had a little surge right at this...
Picked up right there.
Okay. S-IVB pressure is 40 and 30 and we had a little surge at about one minute.
Roger. That was PU shift and that looks - the thrust looks good.
Okay.
You feel a very slight amount of bumping...
Yes, it does.
Could have been vibration.
Or trouble.
Yaw's tracking at about 1 degree.
ORDEAL's right on the money.
Track is Go....
Coming over the Hawaiian Islands.
Pressures are steady. ORDEAL's tracking.
Okay, Houston, 15. And we're about halfway through. Pressures are steady at 40 and 30 and ORDEAL is tracking right on through.
Roger, 15. At 3 minutes, it looks completely nominal to us.
Roger.
Delta-VCG.
My countdown's going to be off probably 2 seconds here. Let's start my watch and... it again. I want to be sure the engines... start.
You can feel it, can't you?
Yes.
Converter's started.
Pitchover's...
I get the little surge before the bang.
Okay, we're on P45.
Pressure's looking good. ORDEAL's tracking. A quarter g - a half g...
That computer has... DSKY...
That computer...
Really?
31,925.
pressure.
Okay.
Houston.
Okay, Houston. We have about a minute to go. We're tracking 39 and 30 on the pressures and ORDEAL's about zero.
15, Houston; Roger. Looks good here.
O2 flow, high.
That should be on for cut-off.
Yes, that's right.
15, Houston. We're estimating cut-off about 4 seconds earlier than the PAD time.
Roger. Understand; 5 plus 51.
That's affirmative.
I'll give you a countdown to 55.
Go ahead... Go to...
Okay. Here's the countdown.
Okay.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3...
Okay.
Shutdown, 5 plus 51.
Roger.
stuff down here.
Okay. Al, get the data there.
Yes.
Check S-IVB tank pressures.
S-IVB tank pressure is about 32, coming down. The oxidizer at about 28, coming down on the fuel.
Roger.
SCS TVC Servo Power went Off - went Off. PCM Bit Rate going Low.
FDAI 1 to Inertial.
Yes.
RHC number 2, locked.
Inertial and locked. Okay, when Al gets through with...
Okay, it's time to switch around.
Okay.
Okay, Gordo. Got some data for you, if you're ready to copy.
15, Houston. We're getting a lot of static for some reason. Say again, please.
Roger, Gordo. I've got the cut-off residuals when you're ready to copy.
Go ahead.
Okay. We cut-off on a VI of 35,614. TFC was plus 02; VG was plus 145; Delta-VC was minus 14.9. And I've got the H-dot now if you want it. H-dot was 4,353 and altitude is 167.4.
15, Houston. Most of your readback is blocked by static. Let's wait a little while and try it again.
Okay, Gordo.
Okay, you got all your data, Al?
Yes. The EMS is off.
Okay. Let's switch over. Okay. Switchy, switchy.
Okay, when the Comp Activity light's out, you're just supposed to..., Al.
switchy, switchy.
I need a Verb 66.
Okay.
Then when you all get down in the LEB, get that waste storage vent valve closed.
Yes...
And, Houston, we have the S-IVB in Orb-rate.
Roger. You're loud and clear now.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. I've got the data if you want to copy.
Okay. Sounds good now. Go ahead again.
Okay. DSKY was 35599; VG plus 145; and the Delta VC, minus 14.9; TFC, plus.02. And, for your information, the H-dot was 4353 and the H was 167.4 at cut-off.
Roger. Say again what that figure 'plus 02' was?
Yeah. TFC.
Roger. Okay. Copied all that. And, for your information, the maneuver to the TD&E attitude should start about one second earlier than the Flight Plan. 3:10:53.
Roger. 3:10:53.
