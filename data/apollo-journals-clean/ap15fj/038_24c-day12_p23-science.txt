Apollo 15, Houston. Request S-band Aux to Science, please.
Rog.
Houston, Apollo 15.
Roger, Apollo 15; go ahead.
In getting ready for contamination photography, we find that we've got a - a certain number of exposures left in the Nikon. Namely, we're on exposure number 29 in mag Victor, and we think we have 45 total, which would enable us to complete the contamination photography with the Nikon, if you desire, rather than with the DAC, as you changed. [Long pause.]
15, they plan on using those last 15 frames or so on Victor for postmission calibration, so we still intend to press on with the DAC, please, Dave.
All right, understand. Thank you.
And, Dave, if you'll give us a start time on that, I'll give you a call at the end, because we want you to cycle some extra film through the DAC to give them a little leader there at the end to protect their film or something.
Okay, we'll do that. Stand by.
Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Bob.
Rog. We were seeing the Optics drifting around against the hard stops. We'd like to have you bring them back and then zero them in, per the usual procedure. We kind of guess your getting ready for [a P]52 anyway, aren't you?
Pretty soon.
And, 15, we have your torquing angles. You're Go to torque.
Roger; in 30 seconds.
Apollo 15, Houston. If one of you guys is free, we've got some updates we could read to you. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston; 15. Stand by one.
Okay, understand you're ready. What - the first thing is an Entry PAD. So you might whip out your Entry Checklist.
Okay, Houston; 15. Go ahead on the Entry PAD.
Roger. Would you believe it, we're going to land in mid-Pacific? And after that, it's 000, 153, 000; 294:41:37, 267, plus 26.12, minus 158.10; 06.2; 36097, 6.50; 1084.8, 36179; 294:58:37; 00:29; Noun 69s are NA; 4.00, 02:13; 00:18, 03:38, 07:44; 04, 140.3, 37.5; 213, down, 09.6, right, 4.7; lift vector, up. Comments: 1. Use nonexit EMS pattern, 2. RET of 90K, 6 plus 06, RET of mains, 8 plus 32; landing, 13 plus 29; constant g, roll right; Moon set time, 294:56:20. Over. [Pause.]
Okay, Houston. Understand. Entry PAD, mid-Pac; 000, 153, 000; 294:41:37, 267; plus 26.12, minus 158.10; 06.2; 36097, 6.50; 1084.8, 36179; 294:58:37; 00:29; 4.00, 02:13; 00:18, 03:38, 07:44; 04, 140.3, 37.5; 213, down, 09.6, right, 4.7; lift vector, up. Comments: nonex - use nonexit EMS pattern; RET 90K is 6 plus 06; RET mains, 8 plus 32; RET landing, 13 plus 29; constant g is roll right, Moon set at 294:56:20.
Roger, Al. Good readback. And we'd be interested in knowing the status of the EMS check you ran 2 or 3 hours ago, if you have it.
Yes, sir. The EMS check was just fine.
Okay, that's good to know. At the end of your contamination experiment here, we'll be going into this Mass Spec. boom test. And, if you guys let me know when you're ready, we've got a procedure to read up to you for that. We'll read up to you at that time. I assume you've been told that we aren't going to a midcourse 6, and right now mid-course 7 is looking like .09 [feet per second] which is - makes it kind of problematical as to whether we burn it or not. Weather in the recovery area is currently predicted to be, for your splashdown, 15-knot winds, 4-foot seas, 2,000 scattered, 10 miles - in other words, looking better and better all the time.
Roger, Bob; that sounds great.
Apollo 15, Houston. If you'll give us Accept, we'll give you a very slight clock update to sync you for entry. And be advised we will not be sending a state vector uplink at this time; your vector is still just as good as the one on the ground.
Rog; understand, and you've got Accept. [Long pause.]
15, your computer.
Rog. Thank you.
15, Houston. Request you trim back to the original attitude now.
Okay.
And again, if one of you has a couple of minutes, we can tell you a couple of other things.
Okay, in - in other words, you want us to maneuver back to the original attitude, rather than just damp rates, huh?
Rog; yeah. We'd like to use the same star backgrounds; so that means going back to the original attitude in the Flight Plan around 271:20 or so.
Okay.
Which is what you got called up.
No, we don't have that called up. All we have is damp rates, but we'll do that. [Realises the Flight Plan has been updated.] Oh, what we have called up here? Yeah, okay.
And, 15; Houston. If one of you has some time, we'd like to talk about some stowage, please.
Okay, go ahead.
Okay, we've gone over the stowage which you read down this morning, and everything's shipshape, except we have one question on one item and that concerns the stowage of the core stems. The core stems should be stowed in the sleep restraint that has the CMP's PGA in it. We understand that it's now stowed in the bag on the side of A-8. I guess our first question is, how many - How long is the core stem at the present time? Did you break it down, or is it still three sections long, which we think it is on the ground.
No, it's still three sections long, and we could put it in the sleep restraint. It just seemed like a convenient place to stick it in the bag over there to keep it tied down well.
Okay. Next question is, how'd you get it in the A-8 bag, which according to our measurements on the ground is only 36 inches [92 cm] long and, therefore, apparently not long enough to hold the three lengths of core stem?
Well, it's sticking out a little bit, I guess we have to admit, but it's pretty well cinched down.
Okay, stand by.
But it's no problem; we can put it any place you like. [Long pause.]
Okay, Dave, I guess we - I don't think it makes an awful lot of difference, but it'd probably make a lot of other people happy if we ended up putting it in the sleep restraint. They wouldn't worry about that loose end hanging out there - if it's not too much trouble.
Oh, it's no problem at all; be glad to do that.
Thank you.
You know, we know what number one priority on this spacecraft is. [Pause.]
We wouldn't - we wouldn't lose that or misplace it or get it rattled around for anything, Bob. [Pause.]
No comment. [Pause.]
And you say everything else is okay, huh?
Rog. Everything else is A-okay.
Oh boy.
And, 15, reminder or a question. Did you guys get the word that they like a pad of about 2 seconds worth of 24 frames per second at the end of those photos to protect these things?
Roger; we got that, Bob. Thank you. [Long pause.]
And if you guys'll give me a call when you're ready to do the Mass Spec. boom test, I'll read it up to you.
All righty, Houston; stand by. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Okay, you going to read up the procedures real time on the Mass Spec. boom?
Roger.
Okay, why don't we go ahead and do that, then, while we're finishing up the contamination photos?
Okay, stand by. [Pause.] Okay, 15, first step is Mass Spec. boom to Retract, talkback barber pole for 4 minutes or until gray. If talkback fully gray within 4 minutes, deploy boom and return to Flight Plan. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. Understand you want retract on the Mass Spec. boom for 4 minutes, and, if it goes gray before then, go back to deploy and return to the Flight Plan.
That's affirm. And give - give us a call when you get done.
Roger.
Houston; 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Okay, there's 4 minutes of Retract, and it's still barber pole.
Okay, if the talkback is not fully gray in 4 minutes, let's go to Mass Spec. Boom, Off, center, for one minute. That's just to let the motor cool down.
Okay, it's off now.
Okay. [Pause.]
And what at the end of the one minute?
Okay, at the end of the one minute, we will deploy it for 20 seconds and then Off, center, and then we will retract for 40 seconds or until the talk back is one half barber pole [stalled] or fully gray [retracted] and then Off. Over.
Okay, got you. [Long pause.]
Okay, going to extend.
Okay. [Pause.]
And do you want to pause it off between extend and retract?
Stand by. Not necessary to pause between Deploy and Retract on this.
Okay, it's in Retract now.
Copy. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston, that's the 40 seconds of Retract, and it's at half barber pole, and I've turned it off.
Okay. In that case, we'd like you to repeat the 20-second Deploy, 40-second Retract sequence twice more and, if gray talkback is still not obtained, we'll turn it off and wait until 275 hours, at which point we'll give you a call and we'll replay - we'll repeat that. Over.
Okay, fine. We'll cycle that whole thing twice more.
Roger.
15, Houston. We'd like to proceed with the fuel cell purges now to get those out of the way before the P23s.
Roger, Houston. [Long pause.]
Houston, Mass Spec. boom has been cycled three times. All I can get out of it is a half barber pole, and I've got it turned off right now.
Roger; copy, Al. We'll call you at 275 hours to repeat that, the reason for that is that presently we are sort of sitting in a cold-soak attitude. We're going to repeat it at 275 hours when we're sort of in a hot-soak attitude.
Okay.
Apollo 15, Houston. We'd like to go to Ion Source, Off, and Mass Spec. Experiment to Standby.
Ion Source, Off, and Mass Spec. to Standby.
Roger.
15, Houston. Al, we missed your last Noun 49 [change in position and change in velocity]. [Long pause.]
Okay, I'll show you this one.
Thanks.
15, Houston. Looks like a good set of P23s again, Al. And your gamma, right now, on your vector, is 6.5. [Pause.]
It sounds like, after a while, we might get along without you, huh, Bob.
No comment.
As a matter of fact, if you guys keep working on your ground [calculated] vectors, they might even converge to the onboard vectors pretty soon.
Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston; 15.
Rog; 274:05, we'd like to delete the Mass Spec. line, where you turned on Multiplier, Low, et cetera. We'll delete that.
Okay. We'll delete that line, Robert. Thank you, sir.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
And, Houston; 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Rog; want us to - delete the Logic Power, two, if we're going to do the Mass Spec. at 275? [Pause.]
15, that's affirm.
Okay. [Long pause.]
And, 15; Houston. You got any more updates to our Flight Plan?
No, but I'll scan it over; and, if I find any, I'll let you know.
Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
Houston, 15. Go.
Roger; we have an update to the Flight Plan, if you guys are ready to copy.
Roger. We're ready to copy.
Okay. The attitude that we maneuver to at 274:46 there, for the second set of X-rays should be changed - that Verb 49 maneuver, should be changed to 196, 346, 012. [Pause.] Over. [Pause.]
Roger. Understand the Verb 49 maneuver to the X-ray pointing attitude should be changed to 196, 346, 012.
Roger. And, before we start that Verb 49 maneuver at 274:45 or thereabouts, we'd like to cover the ex - We'd like to close the experiment covers, Alpha/X-ray, to Close. That's the one on panel 278. And then after we get to attitude at about 275:00, we'll go ahead and open those covers again, the Alpha/X-rays. [Long pause.]
Roger. Understand, you want the Alpha/X-ray covers closed before the maneuver and opened after the maneuver.
Roger. These - the new position I sent you up on that - Those two steps there in the procedure are to keep from getting sunlight right in on some of the stuff to protect it. And...
Okay.
...and, also at this time, you may terminate the battery A charge.
Okay, terminating the battery A charge. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Roger, Bob. Do you want us to go to Standby on X-ray while the door is closed, or is it okay to leave it in 'On'?
Rog. You can leave it on - Dave.
Okay.
Apollo 15, Houston. Request Omni Charlie, please.
Omni Charlie.
Apollo 15, Omni Delta, please.
Roger. Omni Delta.
Anybody else like chicken stew?
Chicken stew, huh? Yes, I do. I didn't know we had any. Is that what you have up there?
Yes.
No, uh-uh.
If you want to eat here, I'll be happy to come down the re.
Hey, throw me some beef steak. Well, I guess some turkey and gravy.
[Garble].
Go back where? Yes, man, you aren't kidding.
Thought you wanted to go back to the Moon?
Don't know why.
I'll trade with you, Dave.
All right.
I'll go down there.
Down here?
Yes.
This is our new garbage can down here, huh? Good.
You want to get those readings now, Al, or after supper?
I don't care.
Get them now?
Okay. Start out with 5-C.
5-C reading 4 - 4.2.
All right; 5-D?
3.9.
6-A?
You writing them down?
Yes.
6-A is 4.1.
Okay; 6-B?
4.2.
6-C?
Greater than 5.
No kidding. Huh. Okay...
Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
...6-D?
Houston, 15. Go ahead.
Roger. Remember back aways, we were talking about doing some more Mass Spec. boom tests at 275 hours, which is gone by. We're right now talking about delaying that until 276 hours, approximately, or at least until before you start your Verb 49 maneuvers for the next set of P23s. Over.
Okay, fine.
Okay, fine. 6-D.
We're just letting it [the Mass Spectrometer's boom] heat-soak a little bit longer. [Long pause.]
Is that okay on 6-C, the fact that it's...
I don't know; we'll tell them.
Okay, 6-D is 45.
Okay.
And, Houston; 15. I have some Command Module RCS injector temperatures for you.
Ready to copy.
Okay, these are readings off the Systems Test Meter. 5-A is 4. - or 5-C is 4.2; 5-D is 3.9; 6-A is 4.1; B is 4.2; C is greater than 5; and D is 4.5.
Roger. Copy 4.2, 3.9, 4.1, 4.2, greater than - and 4.5.
Roger.
Here, put it on there, I'll give you a squirt. How many do you want?
Is that the soup?
Chicken stew.
How many do you want?
Three of them.
Ready?
Yes.
Shit.
Screw it in there?
Good.
[Garble].
Yes. Roger.
[Garble].
Yes.
Well, we have a lot of drinks for breakfast.
Okay, I ought to change the LiOH. Which one was it, Al?
Okay, 23 to B and 21 to A-5.
Okay, going into B.
23 into B.
Okay.
I wonder if any of this food is - the - the irradiated food.
Could be ....
One way of preserving food these days is to...
[Garble] radiation.
And it preserves it. At certain times, radiation preserves it.
Okay. Canister change is complete.
Okay. Very good.
[Garble].
That's wrong, Dave.
[Garble]...
Al, you going to monitor comm? I'm going to get off the headset here.
[Garble].
Come forward, Al. Thank you very much. [Garble]. Just ruined the whole thing.
Oh - damn!
Oh, my God.
Freaking DAC won't come off.
You need one of these, too? That okay?
Okay. Okay.
There you go. Can I get that for you?
Thank you.
Ready for it now?
[Garble]. Move over some. [Garble].
If I were you, I'd go over to the lab and pick one up out of there - a perfect sample.
They don't have them.
They don't?
No.
Dammit, why don't you buy a set of them? ...
I might buy them.
Yes, but you'd be taking all that guff.
Feast over his favorite rock.
Right.
[Garble].
How come?
[Garble].
[Garble].
On the ball.
[Garble].
[Garble] to surprise [garble].
[Garble] 330 [garble].
...
Well, I've got a P23 to do in 3 minutes, and then we got to ... the daytime. I got to clean up and change my long johns and take my biomed off, while I got the chance.
Okay.
Okay.
Dave, I hope we're going to be able to see them unload all those rocks.
Yes, I think we should.
Okay.
[Garble] time [garble].
I hope so. Yes. They'll just have to hold up the - the rocks until we're there.
[Garble] going to have a ball [garble]. Is that why you [garble]?
Yes.
[Garble].
Yes.
[Garble] mind working some long hours.
How long does the medical take on the ship?
[Garble].
[Garble] ship until about what - 6 o'clock tomorrow night? We'll be taking that physical until 10 tomorrow night ?
Ten their time is all I know.
Oh, that's right. It's 4 our time, which is...
On board the ship.
Yes. [Garble].
Yes.
[Garble].
[Garble] we're laughing.
[Garble].
I think we might look [garble].
I had it under control. I had it under control.
[Garble].
We're all having his.
Man, we're down low. The cupboard's bare. Bacon squares.
I don't know if we have enough in there for two more. Yes, I guess we do.
[Garble].
Yes, you need a reinfo - forced toe section.
I'll take that and get this - Going to use the camera.
Have a 9-hour rest period.
Make sure I'm turned on there, will you, Dave? My power on?
[Garble].
What? Yes, if you want to dig it out, it's in the - I put it in that bag. Dave, could you get - Dave, could you get - There's a bag in my TSB. One of the white towel bags that has all my gear it in.
Thank you. It's in here, Al.
Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Bob.
Rog. If one of you fellows has the time, we might like to continue on with the Mass Spec. boom retract test.
Okay. Is it something I should write down, or can I just do it real time?
I'll give it to you real time. It's not that complicated, Jim.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. We need the Experiment switch to On down there in the Alpha - Excuse me, the Mass Spec. Experiment switch to On; and the Ion Source, On. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. I understand Mass Spec. Experiment, On; and Ion Source, On. Stand by. [Long pause.]
David, can you get a couple of switches over there? The Mass Spec. Experiment, On; and the Ion Source, On.
Okay, Bob. They're both On.
Okay. And then next, you go down to the other panel, and we go Deploy for 20 seconds on the Mass Spec. boom, and then Retract for 40 seconds, or until we get a gray indication. Over. [Pause.]
Understand you want Deploy for 20 seconds and then - on the Mass Spec. boom, and then Retract, until we get gray, or 40 seconds.
Roger. Whichever occurs first.
Okay.
Okay, Dave. On that Mass Spec. Boom, we go Deploy for 20 seconds. If you want, I can give you a mark.
That's okay.
They're Off.
Go to Off and then I'll have you - and then Re - and then Retract it for 40 seconds...
Okay, Bob. It [the talkback] went gray after thirty seconds.
Roger; copy. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Okay, 15. Looks like it's a cold soak problem, then, Jim. We'll just deploy it all the way out and leave it there.
Okay. You want us to deploy it all the way now, huh?
Right. After we did all that work and succeeded in retracting it, now we'll deploy it.
Okay. We'll deploy it.
Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Bob.
Roger, Al. Recommendation from the ground here. They'd like to see - maybe as many as five optics calibration marks the next time, instead of the two. It's just to give them some data.
Okay, I'll relay that information to our navigator.
Sorry about that, Jim. You sound like Al these days.
Oh, we're getting so we all sound alike up here.
Apollo 15, Houston. We're standing by ready to copy your Noun 49s.
15, Houston. We'd like High Gain [Antenna], pitch at minus 30, yaw of 150.
Okay. Pitch, minus 30; and yaw, plus 5 - 150.
Roger.
And do you want us to go ahead and try and lock it up?
Please do.
Thank you, Al. [Long pause.]
Apollo 15, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Guidance says thank you to Al [for the P23s]. And if - a couple of other things here, if one of you guys has a chance, we'd like a mag sta - magazine status read-out tonight, and we're seeing some noise on Dave's biosensors. He might want to check them or push them down a little bit or something.
Okay, I'll do that. And you want a magazine status read-out. What do - What do you mean by that exactly.
Roger. That means how many picture's been taken in some of the magazines there. I think Al's been doing it. He probably knows what's going on, if he can tell you. [Long pause.]
Okay. I - I guess we don't have a good answer for you on that, Bob. They're all stowed away. And they've all been recorded as we've gone along. Is there any particular need for them before tomorrow sometime?
Negative, Dave. That's a good answer, it turns out.
Okay. I think you'll find them all neatly tucked away and recorded when - when you get them on the ship. [Long pause.]
If you're wondering how many pictures we took, at last count, night before last, it was something like 1,840 some.
Understand, 1,847.
Or somewhere around the ball park.
Is that plus or minus one?
I think that was LM though, maybe yeah. Then you have to add that to the Command Module.
You mean like a mile of Pan Camera film, huh?
Something like that. It looks like it ought to hold a mile by the size of the thing.
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Well, I had - had the log out here, and I took a look at it, and at last count last night, we were 2,631 on Hasselblad pictures, total.
Copy.
Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston; 15.
Roger, Dave. The interest in the mags was in reference to the UV - the mags for the UV photography tomorrow. So the interest was in the number of frames remaining on magazine Mike and magazine Papa, try - trying to determine which of those would be usable for tomorrow's UV photography.
Okay. I think we've got that log in the Flight Plan. Stand by 'til Al finishes his P23s, and we'll take a look.
Roger; understand. No big rush. [Pause.]
[I] think we'll use a mag that has some film in it.
Say again, Dave.
I said, at - at any rate, we'll use a mag that has some film in it tomorrow.
That's a good idea.
Apollo 15, Houston. Requesting Gamma-ray Gain Step, Shield, Off, now, please.
Roger. Shield, Off, now. [Long pause.]
That was a good mark, Al. [Pause.]
Yeah, and it didn't update the state vector very much.
Apollo 15, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Congratulations, Al. You've just been voted to receive a second Vasco da Gama award for that. We were afraid you were going to do them all the way through the rest period.
Well, they're fun enough. I wouldn't mind.
So were we.
[Laughter.] Okay; and...
It wouldn't have taken nearly so long if you hadn't wanted five marks per each star. [Pause.]
Rog, Al. I'll tell you about that some time. And, 15, we're configured for the E-mod dump, if you fellows want to give it to us.
Okay, it[the E-mod dump]'s coming. Does the bio data look any better?
Rog. Yes, it does.
Okay.
And, as you get ready for PTC, we'd like to do the PTC at 0.42 [degrees per second] there again tonight as last night, although it's changing the Noun 79 value there at 277:14. [Pause.]
Rog, Bob. I guess we use that as standard procedure now, the 4200.
Rog. You don't have to do it tomorrow night that way, though.
Okay. Use a different number tomorrow night.
And, Apollo 15, be advised that tomorrow when you're taking your P23 marks, five marks on the cal[ibraton star] and then 3 marks on the [other] stars with the P23 itself will be sufficient.
Okay, understand. 5 marks on the cal and 3 on each star.
Roger. Roger. [Long pause.]
Hey, Houston, 15. We've got the presleep checklist ready, too.
Roger. We're standing by.
The crew's all ready for bed, no medications, and the onboard read-out: Battery C, 37; Pyro Bat A, 37.1; B, 37.1; RCS A, 55; B, 50; C, 48; D, 52. And I guess everything else is done. You've got your E-memory dump, and we're ready to power down as soon as we get the PTC going.
Roger, Dave. As far as we're concerned, we're all finished also. We will not be uplinking a state vector to you. We might have to do that sometime just for practice, but so far we haven't needed to uplink one to you. You guys are doing pretty super on those P23s.
Compensating errors. [Pause.]
I can't believe that was a unanimous vote, Dave. [Pause.]
No, it was only two to one.
Okay, G&C. Let me know when he's in his rate amp.
Apollo 15, Houston. You're Go to start to spinup for PTC.
Okay, Bobby. Thank you. [Long pause.]
And, Apollo 15, we'd like you to check that the Potable Tank Inlet valve is open, please.
Roger; understand. Potable Tank Inlet valve, open. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15.
All right, go ahead, 15.
Okay. Listen, potable tank inlet valve is open and has been the whole flight. What prompted the question?
Stand by. [Pause.]
We're just curious. [Pause.]
15, we saw a drop in the potable at the same time that the waste tank was staying stable, and we were - just concerned that it might have gotten out of configuration. We certainly expected it to be open; we just wanted to check it before you went to sleep, so we didn't have to wake you up.
Okay. Understand. Yeah - we're reading potable at 90 percent.
Roger. We're reading 94.
Apollo 15, Houston. No need to acknowledge, but we'd like to put the DSKY to sleep before you guys go to sleep.
Oh, 6:45 tomorrow.
Yes. [Garble].
He didn't.
Cabin temp, 67.
[Garble].
Oh, shit.
