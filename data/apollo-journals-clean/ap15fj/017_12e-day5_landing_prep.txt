Endeavour, Houston. Standing by for your burn status.
Endeavour, Houston. Standing by for burn status.
Hello, Houston. Endeavour. Rog. Stand by one.
Roger. Roger, Al.
Okay, Houston. The burn got off on time. Burn time, 4 seconds; VGX, minus 0000.9; and I trimmed that to 0 at - roll of 0, pitch of 107, and yaw of 358. VGX was plus all zero's, VGY was plus all zero's, VGZ was minus 0000.5. Delta-VC was minus 11.2; fuel was 29.25; oxidizer, 29.15; and unbalance meter was decreased 50. And I've got me in a 65.2 by 54.8.
Okay, Al. We got everything except the item after the burn time.
Roger. The VGX at shutdown was minus.9. 0.9.
Okay. We copy.
And, Al. I'm ready to give you a P24 PAD, when you're ready to copy.
Okay, Ed. Go ahead.
Rog. 15-1; T-1, 102:37:27; T-2, 42:17; TCA, 43:57; T-3, 44:45. The attitude is nominal, and you'll be off track 3 miles to the north.
Roger. I understand. 24 landmark tracking PAD, tracking 15-1; T-1, 102:37:27; 42:17; 43:57; 44:45. Nominal attitude is off track north 3 miles.
Good readback.
Rog.
Ed, I have some AGS Cal numbers for you.
Okay, Falcon. Ready to copy.
Roger. The initial values: plus 02, minus 04, plus 03, plus 02, plus 90, minus 07. Cal values: plus 02, minus 04, plus 02, plus 21, plus 81, and minus 15.
Copied all of them. Those numbers look good, Falcon.
And, Houston; Falcon. We're ready to go with the DPS.
Okay. And we're ready to go with the DPS pressure checkout any time you are.
Okay. We're ready. Press on.
Roger.
Endeavour, Houston. Give us Narrow please on your High Gain.
Rog.
Okay, Houston; Falcon. We've done the descent start. The ambient pressure is down to 450 but the manifold pressure hasn't moved.
Stand by. Okay, Falcon. We believe you turned your PQM Off, and - and that's your PQGS Off, and - probably your problem - your hed - Helium Monitor. I think you got it inadvertently. And, Endeavour, we'll take P00 and Accept.
Roger. You got it.
And Falcon...
Oh, yeah, Ed. Thank you.
Rog. DPS looks good from down here.
Okay.
And, Falcon; Houston. A couple of items. Dave do you have a warm feel for the LPD decal.
Rog, Ed. It was right on.
Good enough. And we'd like for you to take your Propellant Temp/Press Monitor to Ascent and give us an Ox tank read-out, please.
Oxidizer is 100.
We copy. Thank you. And, Dave, be advised, there will be no gyro bias updates - or gyro drift updates.
Okay; very good.
Houston, Falcon. Going into landing radar checkout now.
Roger, Roger, Falcon.
Altitude Transmitter is 3.6. Velocity Transmitter, 3.8.
Okay, Endeavour; Houston. Computer is yours, and you can start your maneuver.
Endeavour, Houston. The computer is yours. You can start your maneuver.
Roger, Houston; Endeavour. Thank you.
Endeavour, Houston. We're recommending a half a degree per second for your maneuver. You've got quite aways to go.
Rog, Ed.
And, Houston; Falcon. The Landing Radar looks good up here.
Roger. It looks good here.
Rog.
Falcon, Houston. If you'll let us have P00 and Data, we have uplink for you.
Roger.
And I have PADs for Endeavour and Falcon, when you're both ready.
Falcon's ready.
Endeavour's ready.
Okay. Here we go. With Echo, 104:42:30.00; Foxtrot, plus 0108.2, plus all zeros, minus 0050.0; 0144.9, plus 0008.6, 0119.2; 0:36, 000, 270; 0282.5; plus 0108.5, plus all zeros, minus 0049.3; Golf, 107:37:30.00; Hotel, 109:18:45.00. Readback.

Okay. You got cut out there. Your AGS Delta-VZ, confirm it's a negative and Hotel 109:18:45.00.
That's confirmed, Ed.
Okay. Endeavour, give us Omni Charlie, please.
Endeavour on Omni Charlie.
Roger. And did you get the readbacks, Al?
Endeavour copied them - copied the PADs. Rog.
Okay. Here we go with India PDI PAD: 104:30:10.94; 11:03, plus 0002.9; 002, 110, 310; plus 56922; Juliet: 109:18:45.00; Kilo: 107:27:30.00; Lima: 104:50:49.67; Meco: 109:18:45.00; T-2 is at PDI plus 20:39; Nectar: 106:41:20.05. Readback.

Okay. The T-2 time is at 20:39.
Roger. 20:39.
Let's try it again - 20:39.
20:39; thank you, Ed.
Good readback. Falcon, computer's yours.
Houston, Endeavour.
Go ahead, Endeavour.
Roger, Ed. Just checking over this P24 PAD again. And you didn't update the longitude over 2 on this one. Did you want to do that?
Stand by. Negative, Al. Go with the one in the Flight Plan.
and low altitude. Okay.
Falcon, Houston. Over.
Houston, Falcon. Go.
Roger. Check your CO2 Sensor circuit breaker. We're showing off-scale low.
Okay.
Circuit breaker's closed, Ed.
Roger.
Endeavour, standby for T-1 minus 30 seconds.
Mark.
Rog.
Mark. One minute; T-2 minus 1.
Rog.
Standby for 30 seconds.
Mark.
10 seconds.
Mark.
Okay, Houston. It's out of sight.
Roger, Endeavour. How did you feel about them, Al?
Oh, I felt good about them, Ed. Right on.
Very good. Thank you.
No question about the landmark. And every mark, I had the - the crater centered, Crater Index.
Very, very good. Thank you. And I have an update to the PDI abort PAD, when Endeavour and Falcon are ready.
The Falcon's ready.
Endeavour's ready.
Okay. It's item Kilo. Should be 107:20:30.00.
Okay. Falcon copied Kilo as 107:20:30.00.
Good readback.
Endeavour copies.
Endeavour, Houston. Omni Delta.
Falcon, Houston.
Alright. Go ahead, Ed.
Let's see if you can reach Endeavour and ask him to bring the High Gain up. Flight Plan angles, please. Minus 69 and 114.
Roger. Endeavour, this is Falcon. How do you read? Roger. Houston would like you to bring up the High Gain to a minus 69 and a 114.
Houston, Falcon. Do you have the torquing angles?
That's affirm. We have, Falcon.
Rog. Torque to 30.
Copy.
Houston, Endeavour's up on High Gain.
Roger, Endeavour.
And, Endeavour, we copy your Noun 93s.
Okay, Ed. And I'll torque them out on the minute.
Endeavour, Houston. Recommending monitor 92, Noun 92.
Roger.
Okay, Houston; Falcon. How's the P63 look?
Okay, Dave. It looks very good. Time's okay. And be advised, both Endeavour and Falcon, that the P24 looked good. There will be an update, but we feel very confident about it.
Okay, Falcon here. Very good.
And, Falcon, we'd like to see a Verb 47 down to the AGS, please. And be advised that your platform, both gyros and PIPA 's, are good shape. No updates to them.
Very good.
Houston, Falcon. While that's running through there, we're going back through notes, checking over the activation. And one thing we missed there was, just before undocking, we ran the suit pressure integrity check, and the first time around, we got a greater than 3/10ths decrease in one minute. So we cycled through both regulators, did that test, and came back and ran the suit integrity check again, and it was just fine. It was about 1/10th in a minute.
Okay, Falcon. We copy that. Thank you.
Okay.
Falcon, Houston.
Houston, Falcon. Go.
Rog, Dave. Talk about reviewing notes, we did so, also, and we found one we'd like to pass to you before LOS.
Okay.
Dave, we - working out a procedure down here that we simmed, and it's in the event of a low thrusting DPS during PDI. We're prepared to call to you - an RCS thrust augmentation for one minute, at about one minute or a minute and a half into the burn. And recommend doing it on the LMP's TTCA, if we have to do it at all. What do you think?
That's fine. We'll try that if we need it.
Okay, the procedures are very simple. We'll call it to you as we've measured the thrust.
Okay. And I guess you'll call "On" and call "Off" with the TTCA, is that correct?
We can. That'll just be a one minute - a one minute burst.
Okay, fine. And by the way, when we went by PD - PDI-0, we took a couple of hacks at the altitude. It showed 10 miles even.
Very good.
Falcon, Houston. You're about a minute and 40 seconds from LOS. We'd like to see your 400 plus 30000 before LOS.
Rog. In work.
Falcon, Houston. LOS in 30 seconds.
Roger, Houston; Falcon. All set.
Omni Delta...
Endeavour; Rog.
Okay.
Endeavour, Houston.
Houston, Endeavour. Go ahead.
Rog, Al. Your a minute from LOS. We recommend, on the next pass, check your S-Band Squelch Switch, Off.
Ah, Rog.
Thank you.
Thank you. It was On.
Falcon, Houston.
Falcon, Houston.
Houston, Falcon. Go.
Roger, Falcon. We're ready for your Ascent Bat On time and your ED Bat report.
Roger, Ed. The Ascent Bats were On at 103:50:45, and I'll check the ED Bats now.
And, Houston, this is Falcon. ED batteries both check at 37 volts.
Copy; 37 volts. And I have an update to your PDI PAD.
Roger. Go ahead.
And, Falcon, give us P00 and Data, and we'll give you an uplink.
P00 and Data. Go ahead with the PAD.
Roger. India: 104:30:08.54.
Yes? Okay.
Ed, if you're reading us, you ought to call us after the - the uplink. We cannot read you.
Locked up yet?
No.
Here it comes; don't change it. It's coming in.

Falcon, Houston. How do you read now?
Read you loud and clear, Ed. I'm ready for that update now.
Roger. India: 104:30:08.54; Noun 61 crossrange, plus 0003.3; DEDA 231, plus 56943.
Roger. 104:30:08.54; crossrange, plus 0003.3; DEDA 231, plus 56943.
Readback is correct, and be advised that crossrange number means you're going from south to north. You'll probably see some roll during the PDI.
