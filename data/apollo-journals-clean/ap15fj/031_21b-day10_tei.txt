And, Endeavour, when you're ready, I've got a coming-home PAD to read to you. [Pause.]
Stand by one, Joe.
Okay, Jim. And we would like Accept, please, on the computer. [Pause.]
Stand by one.
A very pretty satellite out there. We get about two flashes per rev off each boom, and it seems to be rotating quite well. Very stable.
Very good, Dave. Thank you. [Long pause.]
And, Joe, I'm ready to copy that coming-home PAD.
Okay, Jim. I'm ready to read it to you. It's TEI-74, SPS/G&N. The weight, 35768; plus 0.57, plus 0.88; 223:48:45.05; plus 2945.2, minus 0761.3, minus 0171.4; all zips on roll, pitch and yaw; [Pause.] Noun 44 is NA, and plus 0022.1; 3046.8, 2:21, 3028.5; 37; 224.3, 30.5; 053, down 10.3, right 3.1; plus 26.11, minus 157.97; 1084.1, 36179; and the GET, 294:58:34. GDC Align, Vega and Deneb; 102; 178; 028. Four jets, 12-second ullage. And, we'd like Accept, please. And I'm standing by for the readback. Over.
Okay; you have Accept, and here's the readback, Joe. TEI-74, SPS/G&N; 35768; plus 0.57, plus 0.88; 223:48:45.05; plus 2945.2, minus 0761.3, minus 0171.4; all zips for roll, pitch and yaw; HP, plus 0022.1; 3046.8, 2:21, 3028.5; 37, 224.3, 30.5; 053, down 10.3, right 3.1; plus 26.11, minus 157.97; 1084.1, 36179; 294:58:34. Vega and Deneb; 102; 178; 028. Four jet for 12 seconds.
Okay, Jim. The readback is right on. I've got a TEI-75 preliminary PAD and a Flight Plan update PAD, when your ready. [Pause.]
Okay, I'll take TEI-75.
Okay. SPS/G&N, TEI-75; 35768; plus 0.57, plus 0.88; 225:48:44.08; plus 2981.4, minus 0807.2, minus 0145.1; 000, 002, 001; all the rest, NA. Ullage, four jet, 12 seconds. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. TEI-75, SPS/G&N; 35768; plus 0.57, plus 0.88; 225:48:44.08; plus 2981.4, minus 0807.2, minus 0145.1; 000, 002, 001. Four jets for 12 seconds.
Sounds good, Jim. Thank you. And I'm standing by for your call for the Flight Plan update.
Go ahead, Joe; I'll take that.
Okay, Jim. And it's your computer [i.e. the upload of a state vector and target have been completed and the crew can take control of the computer again]. The Flight Plan update begins at 223 plus 51. And change the "Verb 49 maneuver" from the numbers listed to the numbers "127, 270, 030." Over. [Pause.]
Read you. For the Verb 49 that occurs at 223:51, change the numbers to "127, 270 and 030."
That's correct. And the next entry is at 224 plus 00. Change the line "Omni Delta" to read "Omni Charlie."
Okay, Joe. Going back to 224:00, that'll be "Omni Charlie" instead of "Omni Dog." Then, on that Map Camera photo PAD, its 224:03:00 and stop on MSFN cue. Then down to 224:15, on the "Map Camera, Image Motion" will - it'll be "barber pole plus two" instead of "three". At 224:21, we'll delete the "Verb 49 maneuver." At 224:23, we'll delete the "Map Camera track." At 224:27, delete "Map Camera/Laser Experiment Covers, Closed." And at 224:40, do a "Verb 49 maneuver to 127, 295, 030; High Gain, pitch, 23; yaw, 229."
Right on, Jim. Thank you.
Good ship, Endeavour, be advised that our tracking stations have acquired the satellite.
Oh, very good.
Apollo 15, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Jim, this is a comment for you. When I was reading the Flight Plan update to you, we noticed that you might be coming up on something not too clear in the Flight Plan and it involves the long list of steps between 224 plus 00 and 224 plus about 15. And there are a number of steps in there that have to be accomplished before the T-start time on the Map Camera photo PAD. It may be, you - be you'll want to start on a few of them, I guess, a little early. Over.
Okay, thank you, Joe. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, this is Houston. We'll be requesting Omni Delta when you lose the uplink.
Rog; Omni Delta [garble].
Hello, Endeavour; this is Houston. [Pause.]
Houston, Endeavour. Go.
Roger, Endeavour. I have three requests for you. The first, the Optics is in the CMC Mode, and we've noticed it's drifting off. We'd like you to drive it manually back to a value less than 10 degrees in Trunnion and then zero it. We're also waiting for a DAP load and a P40. And I have a guaranteed last correction to your Flight Plan, when you're ready.
Okay, number 1, we've still got to make the star check. We'll take care of that, and I hope - I hope you've already seen the DAP load and the P40, but we'll take a look at it again for you. [Long pause.]
Okay, Joe. We - I'm ready to take that last change to the Flight Plan.
Okay, Jim; stand by one. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jimmy, this is an easy one. At 224 plus 14, we want you to delete the line that reads "Map Camera, Image Motion to On, talkback barber pole in three to five seconds, then gray." Delete that line, please. Over.
Okay, that's an easy one. I'll delete that line that says "Map Camera, Image Motion, On, talkback barber pole in three to five seconds, then gray."
Rog, Jim. Thank you.
Hello, Endeavour; this is Houston.
Okay, Houston, Endeavour. Go.
Roger. Dave, Al and Jim, be advised you are Go for Trans-Earth Injection. Set your sails for home. We're predicting good weather, a strong tail wind, and we'll be waiting on the docks. Over.
Okay. Thank you very much, Houston. We'll see you around the corner.
Rog. We'll be watching.

Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
Hello, Houston. Endeavour's on the way home with a burn status report for you.
Roger. Sounds good. Standing by.
Roger. Ignition was on time. Burn time was 2 plus 21. No trim. Our residuals were minus 0.2, plus 0.6, and plus 0.2. Delta-VC was minus 16.7; fuel, 2.35; oxidizer, 2.2; the unbalance was about minus 25. And what a smooth burn that one was.
Roger. Sounds very good to us, Dave. [Pause.]
Just can't beat these rocket engines for traveling.
Should hope not.
Apollo 15, Houston. Over. [Pause.]
Houston, 15. Go.
Roger. Two questions. One, we notice you have A/C roll jets selected. I guess we aren't sure whether you have B - A/C roll jets selected on DAP, we aren't sure whether you have A/C or B/D selected on the panel. [Pause.]
Okay. Al's checking them over now. [Long pause.] Okay, A/C, you're selected.
Okay, and could we pry out of you guys any comments on the Moon as you leave?
Well, we're almost speechless looking at this thing. It's amazing. Looks like we're going straight up; and we're leaving, there's no doubt about that. And we're right on the terminator. It shows very distinctly all the topography - all the topographic highs and lows. And we can see some major rilles. And we noticed one large lava filling within a depression, with domes very prominent within the lava fill. [Pause.] Oh, it's just really pretty spectacular. We have one crater almost below us that has a flat floor with radial rilles and circumferential rilles extending from the central peaks. I think we saw that as we flew over.
Roger; copy. Sounds beautiful.
It's really spectacular. The elevation - the topography on the ridge line is quite clear, and, of course, all the features near the terminator stand out quite well because of the shadows. And we're busily taking pictures so maybe we can bring some of it back for you to see.
Be looking for it in three or four days.
Rog. It's really spectacular though, and there's no question that we're leaving. As a matter of fact, the first glimpse we got, it was quite obvious that we're on the way. [Pause.]
That's a pretty good view after all those days of going around and around, isn't it Dave?
Yeah, boy.
Looks like you're going straight out, Dick.
Yep. Reminiscing for me. Thank you.
Although, I'll tell you, we never got to see half of what we passed over, I'm sure. There's just so much up there. [Pause.]
Well, I'll tell you, Dave, I'm not so sure you guys didn't get at least your share, or maybe a little more. Spectacular.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Well, I guess our orbital geologist up here just figured out which way we were. I guess we were sort of momentarily disoriented there, because south is up, and we're looking right up and down the terminator. So I guess we're upside down looking at new territory that we haven't seen during the flight. [Long pause.]
Jim just said "Gee, maybe I ought to look out my window." and, by golly, on his window he's looking up - he's looking up to the north. As a matter of fact, out window number 5 now, you can get a full half - half Moon view. [Pause.] And you can see it all in one big gulp, and boy, what a gulp. [Long pause.]
We'll look at Tycho, now, before too long. [Pause.]
That's a good point; we can't see it yet. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Okay, Bob, I'm looking from Humboldt straight south now, and, in fact, you can draw a line between Humboldt and the - and a great ditch or scarp to the south [Vallis Schrödinger]. And there's quite a change in the - in the light level or the intensity of the albedo in - between those two areas. And it looks like there's some - you know - fairly smooth fresh lava flows throughout that area. And, in fact, we noticed that while we were in orbit also, that in several of those areas around Humboldt there, and to the north of Humboldt, and to the east of Humboldt, that the flows in some of the craters there - (And they're quite distinct flows, you can see where they've lapped up against the sides, and you can also see where they've come - where they've spilled down over the sides, sort of reminiscent of the Coso Hills flow) - You can - we looked at these flows and realized that they looked fresh. And yet they had a lot more - the crater count was a lot higher on them than it was on the surrounding terrain. And this flow that we're - kind of looking at now looks - it's a very large area, and it looks like it's just filled - seeped into some craters down there, some of the large craters. It looks much fresher in color. It hasn't - it doesn't look like it has been worked up as much. The craters that pit the lava flow are much sharper than they are, say further to the east. But the count seems to be much higher; the crater count seems to be much higher, even here.
Copy Al. Very interesting.
And, Houston; 15. As we leave and look back, why, I guess we still have the impression the Moon is mostly gray. However, when you're up-Sun, as we were just prior to TEI - when you're looking up-Sun, it does definitely take on a chocolate brown color. We came around prior to TPI on the day side - or TEI on the day side, looking backwards into the Sun across Schröter's Valley, and that was a pretty spectacular sight. And it did start turning a chocolate brown, but now everything is a variation of gray, very light to a gun-metal gray near the terminator.
Well, is that a unanimous vote in the spacecraft, Dave? [Pause.]
Rog. I got three ayes on that one.
Rog. We'll add that, and continue to keep the score. [Pause.]
Good.
Someday I'll get up there.
Hey, Bob, we don't report to you the other kind.
Some day I'll get up there and make my report.
I hope so. [Long pause.]
We can see a point on the terminator now where we mentioned we saw a lava filling and some domes in a depression which is not the circular crater-like depression; it's a big cavity. And now, I guess, as the Sun angle has changed some, we can see where the lava has apparently spilled over a scarp into a deeper cavity, which is in - in shadow. And it's very clearly a filling of the cavity with two levels.
Roger, Dave. We call that a polye, don't we? [Pause.]
Well, I guess if we were in Hawaii.
You guys don't see any motion of that stuff, do you?
Stand by. We'll watch it.
And, Houston; 15. We got another unanimous vote up here. That was really a great trip.
Roger. I think that's unanimous on everyone, isn't it?
Rog.
And, 15, if you'll give us Accept, we'll uplink a REFSMMAT for desired orientation PTC.
Roger. You've got it.
And, 15, it's your computer again.
Roger, Houston.
