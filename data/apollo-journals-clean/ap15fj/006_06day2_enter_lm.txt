Houston, this is [Apollo] 15.
15, this is Houston. Go ahead.
You asked a question on the UV procedures.
Say again, which procedures. You're coming in very weak. [Long pause.]
15, this is Houston. Standing by for questions on UV procedures.
Okay, Karl. Maybe we can get an answer on board. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Houston, it's 15. I think we have an answer. Thank you.
Roger.
Yes. And where's the Hasselblad that's got another - got another adapter on it? Oh, it's just this - son of a bitch right through here.
Where you going to plug that other end in, lineman?
Huh?
Where you going to plug that other end in? You have a place down there?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Where?
That's such a longer cable, though, ... Put...
Yes. Hmm.
The only place that plugs in is over here in the girth bay, isn't it?
Yes.
Well, how the hell do we put a PCM cable in this thing, then?
But your Mag isn't on your - You haven't got a Mag on right now.
Be very...
Okay.
...careful then.
I have been, too.
Look it over.
Oh, my God.
Fooling with your pocket's not ...
Another thing you've got to check in getting this thing on is maybe procedures.
That's right. You always find...
Yes.
...operations to verify.
Okay.
Yes. You got to crank it around once.
Well, we should now make contact.
Press on.
Found ... TV ...
Which one?
There?
...
Okay.
Okay. That's all right.
Hmm!
There you go ....
Tool.
Hmm?
Here. ... Let's see your MAG. Looks all right. Not going in that sprocket.
Yes, it looks like it's tight back here.
...
It wasn't - it wasn't before.
No, I guess it - again.
Egad.
... I've never put that thing...
God damn it - there - I...
Must be another cable...
Connector right here.
There must be another cable.
Yes, there is.
You remember that fit check?
Oh, shit.
The vehicle with the...
Yes.
...with the camera down there on the sextant?
Yes?
You remember who took...
I didn't - No, I didn't do that.
Yes, this is the EL...
Jim, don't you want to...
...PCM.
...use the cables we've got?
...
Will those cables hit - hook together?
No.
Fit together.
Maybe we better do it without PCM.
Yes, it's a shame. That PCM thing. (Sigh) That's...
That's really something.
Could have sworn that goddamn thing was right - right here.
No, there's never been one there. The only place they've ever been...
Let me have it.
Yes.
...was down behind the rock boxes, but you won't reach that either.
No, you just don't reach that either.
There's - there's one behind each rock box.
Yes?
But that's - that's too long for that cable, too.
That's too - Yes, that's right. Too long for the cable.
Too long for that one ....
In there?
No.
Look behind the screen.
CDR's food locker! No. We don't have a CDR's food locker, do we?
Well, that's one of those little things I just never had - for one reason or another, never had checked out, I guess.
I thought you had.
I thought I had, too.
What?
Thought I'd looked at everything.
Not the cameras. ... camera up.
Well, maybe we better press on through.
Yes, okay. Let's do without it.
Okay. Exposure's supposed to be here on 1/500th.
... PCM.
How do you get PCM out of the DAC?
Okay. 1/500ths.
Twenty-four fra - frames per second?
Right; 24.
You want to shoot 5 percent of the Mag? You got Mag H on there?
Mag H. That's correct.
You want to record the percentage. I guess, right now, it's 100 percent.
Can't even see 5 percent on that thing.
Yes, it's about 95 percent.
You can time it, Al. Take 5 percent of the total, times the 24 frames per second.
Yes, you got it...
Okay.
...for 2 seconds.
Okay. Yes.
You got it for 2 seconds.
Huh?
It calls for 2 second's worth at 24.
Two seconds?
Yes.
Oh, okay.
No, the next step is Utility Power, On.
Okay...
[Garble].
...Utility Power is On. Okay.
I guess you need that. Roger.
You want 2 seconds at 24 frames.
Well, let me read - Yes, that's what it calls for.
... That's not 5 per cent. Where do you get the 5 per cent?
Twenty-four ... is this here. ...
Oh, about ... seconds ... We got a bunch of brange - a bunch of changes to make here, Al.
Oh, okay.
You're not ready to run.
Okay.
What you want next is disable jets A-3, B-3, C-4, and D-4.
Okay. That gets the - the dark stuff out of the way. Okay, yes, that's...
Okay, here we go, A...
...protective.
Read them again.
A-3.
Yes.
B-3.
A - A-3 and B-3?
Yes, Bravo 3.
B-3.
C-4?
Bravo or Delta?
No, the last one was Charlie 4.
Okay, Alpha 3, Bravo 3, Charlie 4...
And Dog 4.
Dog 4. Okay, they're disabled.
Then we call P52.
Oh, okay. Okay.
We have to Proceed there until we get the Noun 70 display.
Yes.
We want all zeros in there.
Want to set all zeros in there? Okay.
And then we have some - a load for Noun 88.
Yes, right. Okay.
Okay, Noun 88.
Yes. Read them off.
Minus 10820.
Go.
Minus 79037.
All right.
Minus 60300.
Before we blow it, let's make sure that there's no PCM cable that'll really...
Okay, we - we got a few more steps to do here anyway. Verify the...
Houston, 15.
Wait a minute.
15, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. With the sextant photo test here, we have a call for a PCM cable, and the only ones we have on board will not reach the connectors over by the right-hand girth shelf. Do you have any suggestions on how we can get the DAC connected to the PCM.
That's a good question. Stand by.
Okay.
Okay Al, you can verify through the sextant, if you can, that the optics are boresighted on the target.
Okay. We want to proceed on this display, right? Okay.
Okay, now I'm going down to the station there and see if I can see that...
Yes, that one's right.
Okay, Jim.
Okay, G&N Power AC on panel 5 comes off.
Yes, you want to turn G&N Power off?
It's off.
Okay.
And mount the DAC on the sextant.
Okay.
Then we're ready to dim interior lights; then you can turn the DAC on, 24 frames per second for 2 seconds.
Twenty-four frames per second for 2 seconds, you want? Let's wait until we get an answer from them on the PCM.
Yes.
Yes. Here's a cap comes right here. It's ...
That came out of the - that's the electrical connector for the suit.
Yes.
The cover. If you'd just find my spoon, I'd be a lot happier.
Yes.
Why don't you put that in your pocket and then put on suits when we get the PRDs up.
Yes.
Okay, Al. Another thing after this - Then you change the time and, 1/60th of a second, you take one frame at 60 - 60 seconds exposure time, one frame at 20, one frame at 5, and one frame at 1.
Okay.
Let's see. You want - Let's see. You want ...?
I don't care.
... seconds ... watch.
Yes. We want to turn out as many lights as we can.
Yes, let me put the shades up then.
Okay.
Put all the shades up and turn out all the lights inside.
We came all the way out here for some poor guy, we might as well try and do his experiment right.
Is this for "Dim Light" Dunkelman?
Yes. Bob Mercer.
Oh, yes.
Try and do it right.
You sure that other cable won't work on that camera? The one for the EL?
No.
Let's try it.
Try it and see. It's...
This here?
It's always been my understanding that it wouldn't. It's not long enough anyway, I don't think.
We really can't do a thing.
See if it'll hook to the bottom one.
No, it's too short.
Certainly.
Shit, it's not even close.
Sure.
...
Sure.
You can't - can't fit them together.
Goddamn it, there's an outlet down here somewhere.
Maybe that'll go behind the - rock box, Al.
Huh?
Fit - will that fit on the camera though? Will this piece go onto the camera?
I think that's the same kind of connection as on the - on the Hasselblad.
Yes.
There you go, behind the rock box. Jawohl. Yes.
That seems like a...
That's a hell of a thing to have to do, but I think there's one in - back there. I remember seeing it during checkout. Right there. There's one way back in there.
Well, there used to be one back here.
Yes.
Science Instrumentation, 162.
How about that.
That's - see? It's not long enough to go there. (Laughter).
You're kidding.
Uh-uh.
How about just - Isn't there one on the other side, Dave?
Yes, but it's - There is, but if it's not long enough to go on this side, it certainly won't go on the other side. Does that look that kind like...
That's the G&N.
Yes.
Does that look like the right kind of plug, anyway, Al?
Yes. Yes, it does.
15, this is Houston.
Houston, 15.
I guess we have to agree with you that that cable doesn't reach all the way over to 227, and the request down here is that you voice-record shutter opening and shutter closing on the S - on the DSE.
Okay. I'll voice-record shutter opening and shutter closing. We'll do that.
Thank you.
What's the number of that panel down there, Al?
162.
Okay; and be advised, we also tried to get it to panel 162 without success. It was too short for that one, too.
Roger. We copy.
... panel 162.
Well, we did everything we could.
Move the rock box for me, please.
Nothing else you can do? You tried.
Yes, I never thought about the - juice that thing down here in the LEB.
Okay, Jim, let's get on with it here.
Turn down the lights. Your first one'll be for 2 seconds.
Okay. Let me make sure I got all the right stuff set up here - 1/24th [sic] and 1/500th.
Jim, make sure your tape recorder's going. You record the starts and stops like nobody does.
That right? Yes, I will.
Tape recorder's moving.
It is moving?
Yes.
Okay; you ready?
Yes, I'm ready. Two seconds.
Okay. Okay, 2 seconds. Count now, one, 1,000; two, 1,000; Off.
Okay. Change to time and - 1/60th.
Okay.
Time and 1/60th.
Okay, it's time and 1/60th.
Okay, and the first one'll be 60 seconds.
Okay. Have you got the clock running there? You can...
Give me a mark, and I'll tell you when to stop it.
Okay, on my mark...
Mark.
I think you'd be better off if you turned that off, Jim. Just - Can you see the timer without turning that light on? Yes. You going to tell me at 1 minute?
Try it again with the kitchen timer.
Huh?
Try it again with the kitchen timer.
Oh, okay.
Stand by.
Mark.
Okay.
That's on the kitchen timer.
Okay; let's take two of that.
Yes.
At...
Okay - Why don't you give me a mark, and I'll start the kitchen timer.
Okay. Let me make sure I got this set up right.
That would be a - Okay.
Okay. You ready?
Yes, I'm ready.
On my mark...
Mark.
When you hear the "ding," why, you can release it.
Okay.
I must say, if that recorder's working okay, I must say that I don't think this - photography's going to come out very good because there's an awful lot of bright - great number of bright particles right out in front of the spacecraft.
Ding.
Okay.
Mark.
Now what's the next one?
The next one's 20 seconds.
Okay. Same - 1/60th?
Yes.
We want that one much.
Standing by for your call.
Okay. On my mark -
Mark.
Stand by.
Mark.
Mark. Okay.
...
Okay. What's the next speed there, and time?
Next one is 5 seconds.
Okay. On my mark.
Mark.
Okay. Stand by.
Mark.
Okay.
Okay, next one's - 1 second.
Okay. One second?
One second.
Okay.
Okay...
Hmm!
Lucky.
That sure does look funny.
Sounds like we got more than one frame.
Huh?
Sounded like you got more than one frame.
Yes, it did.
Do you show it time and 1/60th?
No, I'm at 1 frame per second.
You should have been on time.
All right. I'll take one on time for 1 second.
Well, how about - All the others were okay though? Yes.
Yes, all the others are okay.
Yes. Yes.
That - the last two are going to be - one's going to be maybe a couple of frames at 1 second, or one - or a couple of frames per second - yes, at 1 frame per second.
Well, why don't you just take a 5-second one then?
At 1/60th. Huh?
In other words, you want to repeat the 5 second, too?
No. No.
One frame per second's going to be a lot different from 1 second per frame.
One frame per second is a lot different than 1 second frame.
I know it.
Yes. That's what I'm saying. Maybe we ought to repeat the 5-second exposure.
No, that should be all right. I did that on time.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, okay, go back to 24 frames per second.
Okay. (Sneeze).
And 1/500th.
And 1/500th; oo, that's going to be a - Okay.
And then run the DAC for 2 seconds.
Okay.
And then lights up, enable jets, and do a Verb 49 to another target.
Okay.
Don't know what time it is.
I got them.
Did you get the jets enabled yet, Dave?
Coming up.
Okay, Verb 49.
Let me make sure I get the right jets, A-3, C-4, B-3, and D-4.
Right.
Okay.
Give me a Verb 49.
Okay, 239, 169, 330.
Okay, 239, 169, and 330. That's wrong.
Really?
Is that for the sextant or the UV?
We have to do another with the...
Gee. Well, that's fair enough.
G0 maneuver.
Golly, that's a...
And, Al, when we get there, we'll repeat - repeat step 3, yes.
What? With the sextant and stuff?
Yes.
Oh, I thought we were done with it.
No, no, I'm sorry. We got a whole bunch more. We've got...
Oh.
...to do the same thing on another target.
Oh, okay, okay.
Now that you got it all put away.
Sorry about that. Speak up there, James. Okay, we got to maneuver?
Yes, we're maneuvering now. Oh, boy.
I didn't tell you to remove the stuff, Al.
Huh?
I didn't tell you to remove it. Stop.
Tough. Why, we're doing the UV next, James.
Time wise?
We're a little behind. We're at 25.
UV. By golly. You got to hustle, man. I'll be getting some of that stuff out for you.
They want you to take all the Mags over on this thing.
Yes.
Want to get all your Mags out and stuff like that to take over, huh?
Yes, since you're down there - why don't you?
Get the ones in...
R-13. They're almost all in R-13, Jim.
Okay. That's all over by Jim there.
Yes.
I think I can help.
A-8 - There are three Mags in A-8 you can get out, Al. You can get those; S, T, and U.
They're in A-8, huh?
Yes.
Okay. Yes, that's right. Those are those - Hasselblad things, since they're in there.
You want me to take these out of R-13 now, Dave?
Yes. Let's just get them all ready.
Tie them down there on the couch some way?
Let's see. How about O, P, and Q?
No. Well, all ours are double letters, really, Al.
Yes.
So anything that's a single letter is yours. So what I'm really looking for is SS, TT, and UU.
Hmm.
Yes, and then you got to have the UV done, the TV out, and be over there for a TV pass in an hour.
That's ... Okay.
We need the jettison bag out of A-2, Al. If you're in that vicinity.
Okay.
Very strange. I don't see any SS, TT...
Well, if it just says "LM S, T, and U," that's good.
Oh, hey, in here. Yes, I guess this is it here. They didn't mark them double. I bet you this is it.
Sorry about that.
Yes, LM S, T, and U.
Yes. Can you get us the jettison bag out of A-2?
Yes.
That your UCTA down there, Jim? Leaking all over.
Is it really?
Where? I don't see it.
Well, I bumped it, and it's just - coming all over me. Okay. Now what do you want out of A-2?
Want a jettison bag.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay. Now for the [garble].
Let's see. You want 13, there.
Okay. Are we in attitude yet?
No, not yet, Al.
No, we're not there, Al. We've got a ways to go.
Okay.
[Garble] I think [garble].
Fine. That's got it. Okay, we got it. Going to be a [garble] got on your hands.
We're not there yet. We need utility straps and retainer straps.
I'll be getting those.
Okay.
From where?
Over from R-5.
Huh?
You get those [garble]?
R-5?
No, we don't need...
Forget it, Al.
Oh, okay. Yes.
Peanuts. Let's really get the big stuff.
Yes. Okay. You got the film? Okay.
And - Got a ways to go. We want to get the LM Data Kit, in R-3. Okay, Ac...
Yes, that's right here.
...Activation Checklist in R-3. Because - R-3's connected with...
The LM Data Card Kit?
Well, the whole thing. The LM Data Kit should be in there.
Oh, that's it, probably, stored back there.
Is that it?
Yes. Should be Activation Checklist.
You want this all over there, Dave?
Yes.
Activation Checklist.
Why don't we just take the Activation?
Yes, take the other thing when I'm not looking.
Yes.
Just a second.
What say? Put it back up? Yes.
...
Let's see how close we are. Let's see ....
Yes, I can get it out for you, if you want. Here it is.
...? We got another 30 degrees to go.
All right.
...
Jim, you're absolutely unreadable. I can't make out a word you're saying, usually.
Okay. I got it, Al.
There you go. I can hear you. Got the cables?
Yes. I got them.
Okay. You want the bracket?
No.
This is going to be just hand held.
Taking it over to the LM.
Okay.
Keep watching the monitor.
Yes. Okay.
Hey! How did you ever get L-2 closed, Al?
L-2 closed. I didn't.
Somehow...
I didn't get it closed. I couldn't close it on all those cables. Could you?
No. Not unless I rewind the cables.
Here.
Too much in here.
Yes, there is.
Here.
Hmm. I don't understand why I can't get A-1 closed.
Huh?
It's got too much in it with the strut that's in the way there. Dave, can you reach down through there and rotate that strut a little bit so that it gets - so that it's...
Yes.
...out of the way of the lid of A-1?
No, I can't. I don't know which way to rotate the darn thing here. It's got to rotate - that's right - it's got to rotate towards you.
Why don't you ... get that thing?
Mmm.
Get it ... I guess. Better than ...
No, no, it won't go that way. It won't make any difference.
... Get it - get it all the way up ...
Yes.
...?
No. It doesn't bend that way.
I don't know what there is about that strut there that - that changed.
Well, something's different there.
There sure is.
The ... attitude. Why don't you do that...
15, Houston. We'd like to have Omni Delta, please. [Pause.]
Roger, Omni Delta.
Okay. I want to get my su - want to get my suit back out of the way. You got to - you got to rotate that strut.
...
What are you doing?
Yes. Get my suit back out of the way here.
Okay.
Okay, if we're at attitude, Dave, you want to disable those jets?
...
A - Able 3, Baker 3, Charlie 4, Dog 4.
Okay. They're disabled.
Okay. Call P52.
Okay. Okay.
And we want a - all zeros and Noun 70.
Yes.
And the Noun 88 - we want the same values.
Oh, we do?
Yes.
Oh, yes. Yes, that's right; 108. Okay. Same values, eh?
Yes.
Okay.
It says verify that, through the sextant, that the optics are boresighted on your target. Get G&N Power on for you.
Okay, we can go to - Let me just make sure I got the same target.
Yes. That's the same one. All right. Up.
G&N Power going off. Mount the DAC on the sextant.
Yes.
Okay, dim interior lights, and - You on 24 frames per second?
Okay. I am now.
Okay, you want to do...
And - and 1/500th?
Uh-huh. Yes, it'll be 1/500th.
Okay. You want it 2 seconds?
Two seconds, yes.
Okay.
Okay. Change the time to 1/60th.
Okay.
You there?
Yes.
Okay. At 60 seconds, give me a mark and I'll give you a time.
1/60th.
Okay. You in what - now what do you want it now?
Sixty seconds.
First one 60 seconds, huh?
Yes.
Okay.
Mark.
Okay.
You going to give me a mark?
Mmm-hmm,
Okay.
About 20 seconds.
Stand by.
Okay.
Mark.
Okay. I want to do that one again. Ready?
Mark.
Why you doing it again?
Hmm?
Why do you want to do it again?
Oh, I was a little bit leery of that last one. I didn't like the way that shutter sounded.
Stand by.
Okay.
Mark.
Okay. Okay. Next?
The next one is 20 seconds.
All right. You ready?
Definitely.
Mark.
Stand by.
Okay.
Mark.
Okay.
Okay, tell me when you're ready. The next one's 5 seconds.
Okay. I'm ready.
Yes.
Mark.
Okay. Stand by.
Mark.
Okay.
Your next one's 1 second.
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Then you change to 24 frames per second.
Okay.
And 1/500th of a second.
Okay.
Then run the DAC for 2 Seconds.
Okay. Done.
Okay. Enable jets.
Okay. Coming on; A-3, Charlie 4, Bravo 3, and Delta 4.
Okay. Record the Mag - percentage. Al, did we use 5 percent?
Yes, we didn't use any more than that.
Select attitude, Jim.
Okay. Verb 49 maneuver to the UV photos .... load them.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. 150, 052, and 033.
150, 052, and 033.
We maneuvering?
What did you get on percentage on the Mags, Al?
Al, percentage on the Mags.
Well. It looks to me like it's about - we started out at about 95 percent and we're down to about 90 percent.
Okay.
... take this ...
Okay. I'm going to put some of those cameras away here. We don't need the pictures any more here, right?
No.
Okay, Dave. Dave, you want to - stash that just for now, and -
Yes.
Still be one more left.
Oh, it'll be a long time.
Yes.
15, this is Houston. We're anxious to know down here if you've checked the LM/CM Delta-P. [Pause.]
Not yet, Karl. We will though.
Okay, Houston, 15.
15, this is Houston.
Okay. The LM/CM Delta-P is now plus .8 [psi, 5.5 kPa], and I guess - there's no need to do the Tunnel Vent Valve, is there, at this stage? Looks to us like we can go ahead and bring the pressure back up - equalize the Delta-P before we get into the tunnel.
Stand by. [Long pause.]
15, this is Houston. We would like to go to Vent on the Tunnel Vent Valve until the Delta-P is - is greater than 2.7.
Okay. We'll do that. [Long pause.]
Dave, we'd like for you to tell us when the Delta-P gets to 2.7 [psi], and stop there. The basic problem here is, we want to dump the residual atmosphere out of the LM in order to put in good fresh oxygen before we have you climb in. We're sort of up against the time line now...
Okay. That's what we...
Righto.
Okay. That - that's what we figured, Karl, [garble].
Good; okay. Don't - don't go below 2.7 Delta-P there.
Rog.
Okay, Houston. We're at 2.7 on the Delta-P on tunnel vent.
15, this is Houston. Say again.
Roger. We're at 2.7 on the Delta-P on the tunnel vent. [Pause.]
15, this is Houston. The number that we need now [for the LM/CM Delta-P], since the [CM] cabin [pressure] went up, is; we need a Delta-P of 3.1 [psi]. We have to vent the tunnel.
Okay, Delta-P at 3.1. [Garble]. [Pause.]
15, we'd like Omni Bravo.
Yeah, Rog. Omni Bravo. And what was your last, after you said you wanted 3.1 on the LM tunnel vent?
Stand by on that one. [Long pause.]
15, this is Houston. To keep our records straight here, we're anxious for you to bring the tunnel down until we have a Delta-P of 3.1. [Pause.]
Rog, Houston. That's in work, and we're up to 2.9 [psi].
15, this is Houston. There's a couple of read-outs we'd like to get, when you have time. First of all, we'd like to get the PRD read-outs for all three of you. And we'd also like to have the magazine numbers used for the sextant photography and for the UV photography.
Okay. Those are as - magazines are as per Flight Plan, and we'll get you the PRD's when we can get down into our suits. We'll get them before the day is out.
Okay, Dave. And, incidentally, can you give us any sort of report on that number 5 window? [Pause.]
[The window] looks clear.
We copy. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. The Delta-P is hanging right in at about: 2.9 to 3.0. I'd suggest we pressed on, huh? [Long pause.]
Stand by on that, Dave.
15, This Houston. Time is not too critical. We'd like to let it vent a little longer. Try to get 3.1 [psi on the gauge]. If we don't reach it in about 5 minutes, we'll probably go ahead.
Okay; understand.
Okay, Houston; 15. We're reading 3.1 [psi] now. [Pause.]
15, Houston. That's excellent. I guess we can go ahead with pressure - pressurizing the LM.
Okay.
15, this is Houston. Can you tell us how the pressurization is going?
Oh, we're all squared away, and the probe's coming out. [Pause.]
Roger. And - if you could give us the high-gain angles [in the Flight Plan] there, we'd like to get that going.
Okay. We'll set 'em up. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. The probe is out, and it worked very smoothly.
We copy.
Okay. Here it is. Jettison, Jim.
I've got the drogue here, Al, if you can get the TV between my legs.
Okay.
I got the probe, Jim. Let's see, you take the jettison bag. I want to put the probe over here by the hatch.
Okay, I've got the Jett bag.
15, Houston. We'd like to have Narrow Beam, please. [Pause.]
Tell them Narrow Beam.
Okay, Karl. You got Narrow.
Thank you.
We go over there yet?
Just a second.
Not yet, Jim. We're not going anywhere yet. There. Okay, now -
Got them lashed down?
Yes, lashed down.
Okay.
Now we need the drogue.
Yes.
It seems to me that - the best thing - Give Jim back that TV. I think we can probably put his drogue also under the couch.
Under Jim's couch?
Well, that's too crowded, but I think under - under here.
Let's see how we might make out. Okay, watch your suit.
Yes.
Change ribbons.
One moment here.
15, this is Houston. Whenever you have a chance up there, we're interested in seeing some TV.
Rog, Houston. We thought we'd get the tunnel cleared out because, with all that extra gear in the Command Module, it's sort of tough to find a place to stow everything. And the TV is - right now, sort of in the way. So we'll try and get to you as soon as we can.
Okay. [Pause.]
It's a new world in this Command Module, with all these extra box - boxes and everything.
Houston, this is 15.
15, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. We had an AC Bus 2 light and a Main Bus B Undervolt. Voltage looks good, and AC Bus 2 looks good. Reading 28.5 volts on Main Bus B and AC Bus 2 looks good. [At] about that time, we had a loss of S-band. I don't know whether it was coincidental or not.
We copy. [Long pause.]
15, this is Houston. We saw some of those problems here on the ground, too. And we would like to get back on the High Gain [Antenna], if you would reacquire.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Yes. Did you...?
You like Auto? Or Reacq.
Auto's fine for what we're doing.
Okay, Houston. You should have the [signal from the] High Gain [Antenna, HGA] now.
Roger, 15. Give us Narrow Beam, please.
Narrow.
Anything over there, Jim?
Okay, Houston, the LMP is in the LM.
Houston copies.
And how's your High Gain?
High Gain is perfect.
Okay. [Long pause.]
15, this is Houston. Could you give us a description of any actions you took when you had that electrical glitch? [Long pause.]
Karl, Jim just reset both [electrical buses] and they - everything seems to be okay now. He checked the voltages, and they were fine.
Thank you.
Houston, 15.
15, this is Houston.
Hey, Karl, [are] you getting anything in on the TV?
Negative, we have no signal yet. [Voice in background: "It's coming, it's coming."] Pardon me; something is just now coming down.
Okay, fine. I'm over in the LM with them, and they're just going through the checklist.
Very good.
15, this is Houston. We're getting a reasonably good TV signal from you. And, we have about four procedure changes connected with the ASA [Abort Sensor Assembly] heater circuit breaker coming up at about 34:30 in your time line, and we'd like your choice as to whether I read it up to you as a block, or whether you want us to read it to you step by step when the time comes. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15. Hey, Karl, how about waiting until Jim and Dave get on comm, and then read up the procedure.
Roger.
If that's satisfactory, let's do it that way.
15, this is Houston.
Go ahead, Houston; 15.
15, when you had the S-band loss back there a few minutes ago, we think the problem was basically on the ground. And, when you lost uplink, it's - it's likely that your High Gain Antenna slewed against the limits; and we wonder if there was any circuit breaker resetting required to get you back up?
Okay, Karl, stand by one, and I'll find out. [Long pause.]
Negative, Houston. No circuit breakers are reset.
Very good. [Pause.] And, Al, we're getting a real good picture down here.
Okay, Karl.
15, the TV picture is beautiful, and we're going to give that cameraman an honorary union card. [Long pause.]
That cameraman's got too many hands busy to answer you right now, Karl.
Houston, 15.
15, this is Houston.
Okay, give us a time hack, would you Karl, please? GET. [Pause.]
Roger. We're counting up to 34 hours, 11 minutes and 50 seconds. 4, 3, 2, 1...
Mark. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15.
15, go ahead.
Rog. If you're ready, Dave and Jim are ready to activate the comm now.
Roger. Did you get that time hack okay.
Yes, sir, sure did. Thank you.
Houston, 15.
15, go ahead.
Roger, Karl. You guys ready to start a comm check now? [Long pause.]
Roger. We're ready down here for a comm check.
Okay, coming your way.
[Garble]. [Long pause.]
Falcon, this is Endeavour reading you 5 square in Duplex B. [Pause.]
Endeavour, this is Houston. I got your message loud and clear.
Houston, Endeavour.
Endeavour, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Rog, Karl. Jim's been calling you on S-band.
Sorry about that. They're just telling me here that we do have some problems, and we need to stand by for a few more minutes.
Okay; understand. Stand by for a few minutes before we try again.
15, this is Houston, and we're all set up for the voice check. [Long pause.]
15, Houston is now configured to go along with you on the voice check. [Long pause.]
Houston - Houston, this is Endeavour. It - apparently Falcon is reading you five square, but you're not reading him.
That's correct, I've had no messages from Falcon.
Okay, he has been calling you, Karl. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15.
15, this is Houston.
Okay, Karl. What are you receiving? Are you getting any low bit rate [data] from the - from the LM - from the Falcon?
That's affirmative.
You are? Okay. [Pause.]
Houston, this is Endeavour. Be advised Falcon's going high bit rate, we'll give you another call.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Falcon, this is Houston. How do you read? [Pause.]
Houston, this is Endeavour again. Apparently Falcon's still reading you, but you're not reading him. How do you pick him up with high bit rate? [Pause.]
Endeavour, Houston is getting the high bit rate data okay, and we'd like to have you hold this present configuration while we think a bit.
Okay, Karl.
Aren't those pretty?
Say again.
Aren't those pretty little things?
Oh boy. Navy blue, yet. Colorful. Too bad they don't work very well.
[Garble] had them watch you configure the camera.
You do?
Yeah. That might be embarrassing.
Really?
Because you might not get it con - Should be back over on the right-hand side. Oh my! You had it last, Al, when you were cleaning up the - screens. I put it in that compartment there, Al, just above the emergency medical kit - compartment above the emergency medicikinal [sic] kit.
15, this is Houston. We're reading you on Vox.
[Ha, ha] Hot on Vox. ...
Okay. Down Voice Back-up...
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, they would - hot mike.
Good, I'm glad you're reading us, Fi - Houston, finally. [Pause.] Are we coming through loud and clear now, Karl?
Roger, Falcon. You're coming through loud and clear.
Okay. I guess while we're in this position, we ought to go back to low [bit rate].
We've got...
We ought to go back to low bit rate.
Yeah. One little problem we ought to discuss with you before we go on. It seems that somewhere along the way, the outer pane of glass on the tapemeter has been shattered. I don't know whether you can get a picture of it on the TV or not; we'll get Al to try and zero in. [Dave points to the offending display.] But about 70 per cent of the glass is gone. The inner pane of glass seems to be okay. There's no apparent damage to the tapemeter itself. It's sitting on 520 and 482. But, I don't know whether you can see it or not, but I'll trace the area which is missing with my finger here. And it looks like the pieces we found - I found one piece that's almost an inch in size, and there's some small ones around. We'll try to pick it up with the tape, and then get the vacuum cleaner later on - to get it all up. So far that's the only obvious discrepancy we've found.
Roger. Dave, we're reading you loud and clear.
[Garble] you want to go back? [Pause.] Okay; back to low bit rate. Let's try that.
Yeah. [The] camera's configured, Dave.
Okay.
Except for the Mag. [Pause.]
Okay; we're on low bit rate. [Pause.]
Houston, how do you read Falcon on low bit rate?
Falcon, Houston is reading you loud and clear on low bit rate.
Roger. We read you the same.
Okay; let's go back Biomed, Right and High bit rate.
Okay. High and Right. [Pause.] Houston, This is Falcon on high bit rate, with Biomed, Right. How do you read?
Roger, Falcon. We're writing - we're reading you loud and clear.
We're reading you the same. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is Falcon again. Biomed, Right and Low bit rate.
Roger, Falcon. We're reading you loud and clear on Biomed, Right, and low bit rate.
Endeavour, we're not reading Falcon at the present time, and we've had loss of signal.
Houston, Endeavour. Roger; understand. And I wonder if you just got that last piece on the TV there. It was a piece of gray tape with some glass on it that came out of the tapemeter.
We're getting a very good picture of it, thank you.
Rog.
Houston, this is Falcon. How do you read?
Falcon, this is Houston. Reading you loud and clear. How us? [Pause.]
Houston, we caught the first part of your transmission, and then you were cut out.
Roger. Falcon, this is Houston. How do you read us?
Read you loud and clear. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. We're in PCM High. How do you read?
Roger. Houston is reading you loud and clear. And did I understand PCM High?
That's affirm. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is Falcon. Standing by for a voice and range check. [Long pause.]
Roger, Falcon. We're ready for step 8. [Pause.]
Houston, we're configured for step 8.
Roger, Falcon. We're reading you loud and clear. How us?
Loud and clear. [Long pause.]
ED Voltage reading 37 on both.
Roger, Falcon. We copy that.
Falcon, this is Houston.
Go ahead Houston, Falcon.
Roger. We'd like to tell you that the initial problem with and - with the S-band was a ground problem, and it looks as though all of the comm checks are Go. And, we would like to ask if our VHF uplink was okay. [Pause.]
Okay, VHF A and B both checked out, with Endeavour, loud and clear. And since we don't have anything other than the sequence camera to check out here, we're going to check that out and then powerdown and take care of the rest of the housekeeping without the power. [Pause.]
Roger, Falcon. [Long pause.]
Falcon, this is Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Be advised that we have - had an excellent TV show here, and that you can secure it, as you like. And I'd like to remind you that we have a - an update to the LM Contingency Checklist that we need to make before you leave - leave the LM.
Okay, we'll take that over in the Command Module, Karl. We'll go ahead and power the LM down now and clean up the housekeeping, and see you on the other side. [Pause.]
Falcon, stand by. We're interested in the OPS checkout.
Rog. We can give you that from the Command Module.
Roger.
We'll do all the housekeeping. We'll just give you the report from Endeavour. [Pause.]
Falcon, that all sounds good, and only one other mat - matter, and that's the docking index angle as you go back through.
Rog. We checked that. It was plus .1.
We copy. [Long pause.]
Hey, Houston, correction. That's a minus .1.
Correction received.
It's so close to zero it's hard to tell.
Houston, Endeavour.
Endeavour, this is Houston.
Okay, Karl. I'll go ahead and secure the TV now.
Very good.
Houston, 15.
15, this is Houston.
Okay, Karl. I've got the OPS checkout numbers for you if you want them.
Very good. Go ahead.
Okay. Commander's OPS had a source pressure of 5,800 [psi, 40,000 kPa], 5,800, And a regulated pressure of 3.8 [psi, 26.2 kPa]. And the LMP's source pressure was 5,800, and regulator pressure was 3.85 [psi, 26.5 kPa].
Roger. Houston copies.
Rog. [Long pause.]
And, 15, when Jim has a couple of minutes, we'd like to ask a few questions about the High Gain Antenna.
Okay; he's off the headset right now, Karl. I'll get him as soon as I can.
Okay.
15, this is Houston.
Hi, Karl. Hey, listen; we're start - going to start up PTC here pretty soon. Do you want to update which RCS jets you want me to use? [Pause.]
Stand by on that, Al.
Okay. I'll go ahead and do the Verb 49 maneuver and start damping rates.
Negative, Al. We want to stand by in this attitude.
Oh, okay.
We - we are thinking real hard down here about your AC glitch and its possible connection to the loss of comm. [Pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
Whenever Jim is available, we'd be pleased to ask a couple of questions.
Roger, Karl. You have to stand by on that. He's finishing up over in the LM right now.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Al, if you are looking for a job, I could read you up a flyby PAD.
Okay, Karl. [I'll] be a moment.
Okay, Houston; this is 15. Go ahead with the PAD, Karl.
Roger. Purpose is flyby, SPS/G&N; 66655; plus 1.24, minus 0.11; 073:30:56.80; plus 0257.2, plus 0230.9, minus 0314.9; 331, 109, 079; NA [meaning not applicable], plus 0020.8; 0467.6, 1:11, 0463.0; sextant star is 02, 148.5, 26.4; boresight star is NA; latitude, plus 13.32, minus 174.04; 1098.7, 36170; 170:59:57. GDC Align stars, Vega and Deneb; 209; 009; 349. No ullage. Comments. The burn is SPS docked. Number 2, use onboard preferred REFSMMAT, because of yaw gimbal angle. Number 3, LM weight is 36220. And that's all. [Long pause.]
Roger; understand. Purpose is flyby, that's SPS/G&N; and PAD's as follows: 66655; plus 1.24, minus 0.11; 073:30:56.80; plus 0257.2, plus 0230.9, minus 0314.9; 331, 109, 079; and the next is NA; and I missed a couple in there. Picking up at sextant star would be 02, 148.5, 26.4; boresight star is NA; latitude is plus 13.32, longitude, minus 174.04; 1098.7, 36170; 170:59:57. Vega and Deneb are set stars; with angles of 209; 009; and 349. No ullage. And the SPS docked burn, use a preferred REFSMMAT because of the yaw gimbal angle, and the LM weight is 33260.
The LM weight is 36220. [Pause.]
Okay, Karl. Understand; 36220.
That's correct. And down in Noun 44, HP is plus 0020.8, Delta-VT, 0467.6, burn time, 1:11, Delta-VC, 0463.0. [Pause.]
Roger, Karl; understand. HA is NA, HP is plus 0020.8; Delta-VT is 0467.6, with a burn time of 1:11. Delta-VC, 0463.0.
Roger. That's all correct.
Okay.
Houston, this is - Endeavour. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is Apollo 15. Over.
15, this is Houston. [Pause.] This is Houston; go ahead.
Yes, Karl, this is Jim, I'm back in and on comm. As far as that AC and main bus undervolt [are concerned], I have not much more to add than what I said before. Do you have any other questions?
Roger. Stand by just about 30 seconds, and we'll come up with a couple.
Okay. [Long pause.]
15, this is Houston.
Go ahead, Karl.
Jim, we've been doing a lot of thinking about that AC glitch down here, and - the coincidence of time - makes us guess that there was a connection with that power loss, but we don't see how. We'd like to start off with a couple of questions. The first one is, when you - reacquired on the High Gain Antenna, did you possibly notice that the High Gain angles were different from what you'd set on the knobs?
Yes; as a matter of fact, they were.
Okay.
I - I did nothing up here to reacquire on the - the High Gain [Antenna]. It came back automatically.
Okay; that's interesting information. Were there any talkbacks noted - changing state at the time of the glitch?
No change that I noticed.
Okay. Was anyone in the tunnel at the time of the glitch? [Pause.]
Say again about the tunnel, Karl.
Was anyone in the tunnel at the time of the glitch? [Pause.]
Stand by.
Okay, Karl. Al was in the tunnel, but there were no electrical connections being made at the time.
Roger. I - I guess a follow up question then - and you've probably answered it - is, was there any unusual activity associated with the tunnel umbilicals?
Don't think so - we don't think so, Karl, not at that time.
Okay. And another question on this line is, what was and what is the position of the LM power 1 Main B and 2 Main B circuit breakers on panel 5?
Stand by. [Pause.]
They're both in [that is, they are Closed].
Roger. [Pause.]
Okay. If you have some minutes to spare up there, we'd like to go through a cockpit check for open circuit breakers connected with Main [bus] B and AC [bus] 2, on the theory that whatever happened might have blown a circuit breaker that wasn't obvious to you.
Okay. I'll - I'll do that now.
We suggest - that - well, you know, this - figures 3-1 and 3-2 are a good guide to that for the normally open circuit breakers.
I'll check all circuit breakers. [Long pause.]
Jim, I've got the diagrams down here, if there's anything I can do to help you.
Okay; we'll look around.
Karl, this is Jim.
Go ahead.
Roger. On [panel] 226, under Lighting, Numerics/Integral, LEB [Lower Equipment Bay] AC 2 has been popped, or I believe it's popped, I would think it'd normally be closed now. [Long pause.]
Roger, Jim. We confirm that that is normally closed. [Pause.]
Okay; it looks like it might be the problem.
15, This is Houston. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Karl.
When you're through checking the circuit breakers, we have a little procedure we'd like to go through here as a - as a further check.
Okay. Did you want me to continue checking? I figured after I - Stand by.
Yes. I thought you checked them all, Jim. Sure. Check them all. Sure.
Roger, Jim. We - we'd like to have a - a complete check there, and don't - don't reset that circuit breaker, incidentally.
I understand.
Not yet.
... do this?
Okay. TV.
...
... That's over ...
Yes, when I read it out to you. Not before.
...
Oh, yes.
Okay, Karl. I've checked all circuit breakers, and that's the only one that seems to be out of [the proper] configuration.
Okay; very good. What we're going to do, Jim, is to drop the uplink and see what happens. And just to clarify the communications glitch that we had, the ground station lost the power amplifier, and we lost uplink to you. There was apparently no loss of downlink. So what we want to do now is to - is to drop the uplink and see if it creates the same glitches that - as you got on the AC bus that time. In view of your circuit breaker being out, we don't think there's a connection, but we'd just like to have this final confirmation. And...
Okay; we're standing by.
...to start the procedure here, we'd like to just double check that you - that the dials for the High Gain Antenna are setting at Pitch, minus 30; Yaw, 276.
Yes, that's correct.
Roger. And verify that we have...
Yaw - yaw is really...
Go ahead.
Yes, we're in Track, Auto.
We - we'd like to have Auto and Narrow [beam width].
Yaw is... [Pause.]
Just let it go for a while. It's black and it's black and it's black.
Pitch is minus 30, Yaw is 270, and Track is Auto. [Long pause.]
... 280.
You can stop that one someplace.
Okay.
Roger, Jim. And what we're going to do now is to drop uplink for 20 seconds, and you are to read out and record the High Gain Antenna dials and any changes that occur there. Then we'll bring up the uplink; and, at that time, we want you to require - reacquire High Gain Antenna on - on Auto, Narrow. Okay?
Okay. Right now the Yaw indicator [for the HGA] is reading about 280. [Pause.]
What does your dial say? [Pause.]
The dial is 280. The thumbwheel is 270.
That's okay. And are you ready for us to drop the uplink? [Pause.]
[Faint] Yes, go ahead. [Pause.] Yes, go ahead.
Okay. We'll be dropping - dropping the uplink for 20 seconds. Here we go.
15, this is Houston. How do you read?
This is 15. I read you loud and clear.
Roger. Did you observe anything special up there?
Well, nothing other than the - the Pitch went to zero, and the Yaw decreased just very slightly. And, of course, when you reacquired, it went back to Pitch went back to 30. [Pause.]
We copy.
That's right ....
Take this here ....
Get it off?
Yes, I ... turn this PRD in.
Get the PRD out of there while you're at it.
Out of - where is it?
It's in the pocket with yours, ... It's in your cuff - by your - top of your right hand. Ah, I got it.
Oh, okay ....
Is this PAD you copied down, Al, is that - the next midcourse, huh?
No. That's a flyby PAD.
15, this is Houston. That's enough troubleshooting, and we're ready to go to PTC now. And we'd like to have you use the A and D quads for damping. And use the B and D quads for spin up. And we'd like to confirm that we are using a spin rate of .375 [degrees per second] this time. [Pause.]
We copied all that, Karl. A and D for damping, B and D for spin up. And .375 for the rate.
Roger.
15, this is Houston. Your rates look low enough to go into spin-up, if all of your vents have been closed.
Okay, Karl. I think we got everything closed, and we'll go ahead and spin her up.
Very good. [Long pause.]
15, could you please confirm that you're on Omni Bravo. [Pause.]
That's affirm, Karl. We're on Omni Bravo.
Thank you.
15, this is Houston. We have a read-out down here that A-1 jet is on. Could you confirm that? And if it is on, let's turn it off. [Pause.]
Roger, Houston; 15. Your read-out is correct and it's now off. Sorry, Karl, I overlooked that one.
Thank you.
15, this is Houston. Your spin-up is looking very good to us, and when you have a couple of minutes to listen, we have a brief status report to send up to you. [Pause.]
Okay; go ahead, Houston. We're standing by.
Okay. In regards to your range-rate tapemeter - That is normally sealed in a helium atmosphere at 15 psi [103 kPa], and with that outer glass broken, this seal is broken and the meter is now operating in zero to 5 psi [34 kPa] in an oxygen environment. We don't know that this has any effect on it, but Grumman is doing tests to show whether or not its okay. Concerning the SPS...
[Garble.]
Yes, go ahead.
I was just going to say, it'd be interesting to hear what they find out.
Roger, we'll let you know. Concerning the SPS, we're still reviewing the LOI [Lunar Orbit Insertion] procedures that we'll use, but it's probable that we'll want to start automatically on bank B and bring on [bank] A five seconds later, using the circuit breaker and then turning it off at 6 minutes and finishing up the burn on bank B. Its probable that the other burns, except for TEI, will be done on bank B only. Any comments on that?
No, that's just about what we were thinking too, Karl.
Okay. In the LM, the batteries and the SHe [Supercritical Helium] look in perfect shape. And concerning the lighting circuit breaker problem: we're still getting in the data in down here, and we'll review the situation with you tomorrow. We see no problem with the High Gain Antenna. And other than your - and other than your crew status report, and your onboard read-outs, that just about wraps up the evening. We'd still like to have your PRD read-outs, and I guess we have a battery charge in progress that will need to be cut off.
Okay, Karl; we'll finish up the rest of the items here and bring you up to date on all the read-outs, and - sorry about the PRDs, but since [garble] the suits [garble] tonight.
Okay. No problem on that. And I have a - I have the update to LM Contingency Checklist, and if you want to take it this evening, I can give it to you; otherwise, it can be put off until tomorrow. [Long pause.]
Okay, stand by. [Long pause.]
[Garble] Karl, [garble] copy notes you have [garble, probably the LM] Contingency Checklist.
15, this is Houston. I heard you trying to come through but we were noisy just then. Hold off just a minute.
Houston, 15.
Reading you better now; go ahead. [Pause.]
15, this is Houston. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15.
15, this is Houston. I'm reading you loud and clear. [Long pause.]
15, this is Houston. How do you read? [Pause.]
You're loud and clear.
Roger. Did I understand that you were ready for the LM Flight Plan - Contingency Checklist update?
Yes, I am, Karl. [Pause.]
Roger. On page 1-1, down under "Power Transfer and RCS Heater Activation."
Go ahead.
At the end of step 2, add the following line: "Circuit breaker 16, Stabilization/Control. ASA, Close." [Long pause.]
Okay; I copy that.
Roger. On page 1-7, under "AGS activation." [Long pause.]
Okay?
I was standing by.
Add before step 1: "Verify ASA circuit breaker - has been Closed for 10 minutes. [Long pause.]
Roger. Understand before step 1, "Verify ASA circuit breaker's been Closed for 10 minutes."
Roger. The next one is page 2-5. [Pause.]
And on that circuit breaker configuration, in the second row down, put a black dot under the ASA circuit breaker. [Pause.]
Okay; I understand.
And on page 2-13. Under "AGS activation and Self Test" add before step 1: "Verify ASA circuit breaker - has been Closed for 10 minutes." [Pause.]
Okay; I copied all of that.
Very good. That's all of the update.
Okay; thank you, Karl.
15, this is Houston. How are you enjoying dinner?
It's just fine, Karl.
Great, glad to hear it. Hey, we'd like to ask a question about that glass breakage in the LM. Did it shatter into little bits or just a few big hunks? How well do you think you got it cleaned up? [Pause.]
Oh, I think we probably got about - maybe 50, 60 percent of what was broken, and it was broken into - some pieces on the order of three-quarters to an inch and other little millimeter type pieces.
Okay. I guess that gives us a picture of the situation. We're somewhat concerned about that having drifted into equipment or - yeah, into equipment. [Pause.]
Okay. Well we looked around and picked up what we could with [sticky] tape, and we took the vacuum cleaner over and ran it for quite a while to try and pull up what we could.
Very good. [Pause.]
We don't have any idea why it broke. It didn't look like there was anything in the ISA [Interim Stowage Assembly] which could have done that to the - just the face of that meter. The ISA had mostly soft equipment. It was pretty well padded.
Okay.
15, this is Houston. We're ready to terminate the charge on Bat A now.
Roger. Terminate charge on Bat A.
And incidentally, we see a - an off-nominal drain on Bat A, and we'd like to verify that the Pitch 1 and the Yaw 1 circuit breakers on panel 8 are Open. If not, we'd like to Open them. [Pause.]
Okay. Standby. [Pause.] Circuit breakers are verified Open.
Thank you. And, let's leave them Open.
Rog.
15, this is - 15, this is Houston. I want to correct a false impression I gave you. We don't see any off-nominal drain on battery A.
Oh, that's good. Thank you.
Okay; Houston, 15.
15, this is Houston. Go ahead. [Pause.]
Okay. We have our presleep checklist when you're ready to copy. [Long pause.]
Roger, 15. Go ahead.
Okay. Crew status report, everybody's in good shape. No medication today. The onboard read-outs: Bat C, 37 [volts]; Pyro Bat A, 37.2; B, 37.2; RCS A, 90 [per cent propellant remaining]; B, 89; C, 91; and D, 89. The [H2 cryo] fans are being cycled now. The water has been chlorinated. All the valves are closed. We're getting ready to pump up the cabin. And we'll give you an E-memory dump whenever you are ready. [Pause.]
Roger, Dave. [Pause.]
And one more thing, we've - I've got the PRDs for you.
Great. Go ahead.
Okay. CDR is 23020, the CMP is 5008, and the LMP is 8008. [Pause.]
Thank you, Dave. And incidentally, if you'd like to get rid of that biomed harness, you can change off now, you know.
Oh, that should work, right now.
15, this is Houston. We're ready for the E-memory dump.
Roger. And here it comes. [Pause.]
And, Dave, a - we - our telemetry says that the optics power is still on, and I'd like to remind you to turn it off.
Yeah, but we just got that off.
Sorry about that. [Pause.]
Well, Karl, does your telemetry tell you it's on or off now?
They were just telling me that - hey, it was off about the time that I called you.
Oh, okay.
Endeavour, Houston. Over. [Long pause.]
Houston, Endeavour. Go ahead.
Roger. Guys, before you go to sleep, I'd like to have the mode - S-band Normal Mode - switch Voice to Off, please.
S-band Normal Mode Voice - switch Voice to Off. Is that it?
Roger. And, unless you guys have something else, we're going to let you go to sleep now.
Okay, Bobby. Thank you.
See you sometime.
