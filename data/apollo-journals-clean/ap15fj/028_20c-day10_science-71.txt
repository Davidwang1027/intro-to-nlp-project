[Garble].
What?
[Garble].
Yes, he'll [garble]. Follow those numbers. As long as we're in Free, it don't really make any difference whether you got P30 running or not, as far as P20 is concerned. Anyway, they don't care about it as long as we don't run it more than a half an hour.
No, he wanted to run the P20 through.
[Garble].
Yes.
[Garble].
You want to do a P20 first.
[Garble].
Yes, you don't need to do that until - They - they need to have us inertial for a while. Yes. We do that calibration in this attitude. And then at...
[Garble]?
Yes. At 55, then we can go ahead and do a P20, and - and get into attitude and then do the P30.
(Yawn) [Garble] time for [garble]?
Hey; you know, it is. What time is that thing happening? Not for a while yet, I bet.
[Garble] another 3 and a half hours.
Yes, [garble].
[Garble]. What [garble] do? Let's see [garble]. We're [garble] that bag [garble]. Put them away - [garble].
Stand by and [garble]. Come on. [Garble] Logic [garble].
8700? The rest of them [garble].
[Garble] still too [garble].
Yes, I know.
Got to [garble] these goddam [garble].
[Garble].
[Garble] this [garble]?
[Garble].
Yes, it's not much of a lineup - from a [garble].
[Garble].
[Garble]. What are you trying to do? [Garble].
Well, if you want to get - well, what I really want to do is make sure we got helmets and gloves [garble]. Be right back.
Where you going?
I got to put your - I got to put my helmet [garble] my EV gloves. The rest of your helmet, Jim, will go with my helmet and your [garble].
Yes, put them down there. [Garble].
[Garble] out?
[Garble] umbilical and [garble].
[Garble] going to do it just like you used to do it with a checklist back when [garble].
Try to find that checklist [garble]. It's part of the requirement. [Garble] do. You're going to have to punch all these goddam switches, pardner.
[Garble] for the [garble] switches, let me know.
Who doesn't?
[Garble].
Just have to see.
We'll have to stow this stuff for TEI. [Garble] umbilical. All this stuff for the EVA configuration, [garble] really [garble] trouble.
[Garble]...
Well, we are going to have to photograph the EVA, too. (Cleared throat)
I know that.
Okay.
[Garble], too. [Garble].
Yes.
We better not use - use your attitude. [Garble]. The rates are low. [Garble] I think once we get [garble]; otherwise, maybe we could arrange a TEI [garble]. [Laughter.]
Yes.
Well, TEI, all we really need to do is [garble].
Sounds like you're trying to get out of EVA [garble]. Tomorrow, [garble] take a little...
Yes.
...reshuffling. So, if you can go now, [garble] some reasonable point [garble] EVA prep. We can try it, anyhow; because tomorrow, when I'm trying to get things squared away for the EVA prep, by the time we can [garble] the EVA prepping [garble]. It'll be late tomorrow before we even [garble].
Yes. We can get all that stuff done [garble].
Yes.
Got lots of stuff to be [garble].
[Garble] for these? Oh! [Garble].
[Garble]. Yes. Well, we can't really use those on this EVA. [Garble].
Yes.
Watch it now. [Garble] coming up [garble].
[Garble]. Where will we have to go with - Well, let's put it in this [garble].
It's getting [garble].
[Garble].
What?
I said, "Why don't we [garble]?"
Yes.
Well, we got the pan camera figured out for the new whole show, huh?
Really?
[Laughter].
Stop laughing, you son of a gun, you [garble].
I - I'm happy that it's even ready to come to, it's such a complicated bunch of shit.
Okay, these return pictures should come out in the [garble] see what happens [garble].
Another - Yes. As soon as we get through this other color, you can hand me that other mag, and I'll get set up for the Earth pictures. I think I'll keep holding it. [Garble] your problem. Why don't...
You know, this thing's [garble] about 30 degrees [garble].
That right?
[Garble] that thing somewhere.
[Garble].
[Garble] would you hold that thing?
Damn right. Just sitting there, looking at the Moon.
[Garble].
[Garble] all right? [Garble]. What'd I do with my mag. Here it is.
Did you take that cover off?
No, not lately. [Garble].
[Garble].
Huh?
Take that [garble].
[Garble].
Move it up a little.
[Garble].
[Garble]. Yes, take these a little bit later.
How's that?
That's about the only way you can get them.
[Garble].
Try to move them.
What?
Try to move them up one.
Yes. No?
Just going to leave these tied down.
[Garble] vertical?
Hey, watch the [garble]. Be sure you don't get any of the crap out of that one.
Yes.
You [garble]?
Yes, that was my Hasselblad pack right here.
Well, that wouldn't [garble].
Really need to take a Hasselblad mag with you.
Yes, give me a Hasselblad mag [garble].
[Garble].
Yes, you're right.
[Garble].
[Garble].
Yes.
[Garble].
All you really need [garble].
[Garble].
Yes.
Okay.
Mine's here. [Garble].
Here are mine, okay. [Garble].
[Garble].
I'll take them.
[Garble].
How you like them? Okay?
[Garble].
Look for yours, pal.
[Laughter.].
You should be proud - you should be proud of yourself, Jim.
Do you intend ignoring that question? Are you a naive [garble]?
I answered it. Hey, you got to get your...
God! What a posthole digger.
Chief priority. Time to do the P20. [Garble] do it?
[Garble].
Oh. [Garble].
[Garble].
Jim, how long has it been since weight? [Garble] says part 1 - part 2, part 2. All the rest of you ready?
Yes.
DAC should be set for right now. Got to notify the [garble].
[Garble].
Y'all noticing that all that noise is gone?
What?
I don't know if [garble].
You ignoring that Flight Plan?
Cut it.
Aw, you ain't that bad. Catch it, son.
[Garble] won't come down. Help me?
All right, God damn you, come help me.
Boy, oh, boy.
All these mags [garble] 2 and a half by 2 millimeter. [Garble].
[Garble] bracket.
Got a [garble] bracket.
That's 80 millimeter [garble] up there.
No. [Garble] I gave it to you.
Hope you don't roll the [garble] back in there.
Can't believe it.
Ah! Okay, 2.8, 1/500th, and click one off - which I just blew.
Okay .
Hey, what time did...
Yes.
Got that one?
Yes, that at the - T-start time, yes.
Yes.
That solar corona is kind of interesting. You might watch it out the window there. You - you can really - you can really see it.
That's right.
Are you going [garble] from here?
Well, Enter. That doesn't work right. Oh, you're trying to Enter on Noun 18.
Oh, my. I've got to have a Noun.
Noun 18 is attitude. Gimbal angles. There's time.
Well, [garble].
You loaded - you loaded gimbal angles, to drive to, for some reason.
[Garble].
Is it going there? You changed the gimbal angles in - in P20.
Why didn't I get a P50?
Because you were probably already - you were probably just getting to the P20 attitude.
[Garble] each time. Why don't we both do 20? You've taken up enough pictures.
Did you Enter on the re - Did you Enter on it when you got to the attitude?
No.
Well, that - Okay. Call up P20 again and go
I get a Noun 18 [garble] Noun 78. [Garble] Noun 18.
What'd you do?
[Garble] option 5?
Yes. Option 5. Yes.
You [garble] another 20?
Okay? Go.
5.1. [Garble]?
Yes...
...[garble]? 5.2?
That's good.
[Garble]?
Oh, it wasn't to the attitude yet, Dave. No wonder. You're in - you're in Hold over there.
Sure enough.
Oh! Blew it!
Well, all I know is I got that needle.
Sure. We're in Low Rate.
[Garble] needle [garble].
All I know is...
Can I load P30 now?
No.
[Garble].
No. Not when we're in maneuver. They won't let you in.
So that's what I did wrong.
Yes. That's why you - that's why you loaded...
I heard...
...the Noun 18.
Well, I thought you said...
It'll come up in a major mode but you won't get...
Oh, I thought...
...You won't get a time display. Yes. You can't; it shuts off the power to display, like a Noun 18.
That T-start is right now, too.
[Garble].
Uh...
216.
216:03. That's right.
We have 15 minutes.
No, we're at 216:03 right now.
[Garble]. We'll never complete [garble].
Yes, we will. That's been all - Well, let's see. Let's get the stick and put in a higher rate in the DAP. Jim?
Get the stick?
Yes.
What the hell's that [garble] 111. Okay.
Okay. I think that does it. I should have played a 3 while I was at it. Huh.
What?
I should have put in a 3 and really zapped it around.
Three [garble].
Yes.
Three is a what? [Garble]?
Three is 2 degrees per second. We better do it.
[Garble].
I don't know if I can hit the stick again, only...
How about the boom? Is that extended?
We got the boom now?
I don't know.
Well, what's the Flight Plan say?
Yes, better not.
Better not. Yes.
You want the [garble], don't you? [Garble].
Yes, we're almost there.
Okay.
Yes, we don't have to start here until - Got 5 minutes left - 80 - 8:55.
Why is that coming up? Why didn't it come down?
Because the mission timer starts. [Garble]. Flight Plan [garble].
Yes, because - yes, because of that one.
[Garble]?
No, this is the mission timer. That - this was - this - Yes?
Mission timer, do you set the start and T-stop [garble]?
That's right. No. We're not doing it because we're using P30 instead.
Be cool if we set the mission timer anyway.
Oh, yes. Sure.
And use our GET?
You can get it off the DSKY. Hell, the goddam thing's already stopped twice - on its own.
What? This one stopped twice?
Yes.
Really?
Yes.
You can't read that DET from over here.
What?
You can't read it from over here to begin with.
I got a good idea.
[Garble] fails if you move.
Well, you - you got the date.
[Garble].
Yes. You tried G&N and comp fail?
Yes.
You tried G&N and comp fail? You're screwed anyway.
Better start getting our [garble] TEI.
Well, I think that's - kind of pushing the rules.
Y'all are getting freaked up.
Yes. We might.
Need a piece of tape. Ought to be a piece of tape around here somewhere.
Yes.
Okay.
Are you there?
Okay.
Yes, call up P30 and put those numbers in the -
Yes [garble] zero.
I'd just - Yes, I'd just leave all those in there or just load it zero. Okay. [Garble]. Doesn't make any difference.
Got 417.
[Garble] Free? You want to let it be for a while?
Yes, we should. On, no, wait. No, that's okay. Those maniacs can wait on Dave. It won't damp.
Huh?
It won't damp because we're in Orb Rate.
You want to go Free?
Yes. Okay. Okay, now - look at those times and remember them, Dave.
Okay.
It starts - Well, the first one's at 5 minutes and then we go 6:40 and every 10 seconds after that. Okay?
You [garble] for that?
Yes.
Got it.
Okay, you ready? Okay.
Mark. One cycle.
Oh!
Now turn out all the MDC lights, and just let - watch the DSKY LEB - if - if you can find one down there.
Mark. Forty.
Yes.
Forty.
Okay.
Thirty.
Okay.
Mark.
Okay, I got the time. You can watch, if you want.
You want a mark at 2:50?
Yes. No, I'll - I'll get it. Just watch out the window.
Mark. 2:50.
Enjoy the scenery.
If that time is good enough, boy, you wait. At 8 minutes, the Sun'll show.
Fifty-five.
Yes.
Ga! Boy!
Isn't that something?
Woo-hooo!
Isn't that something?
Yes, man!
[Laughter.]
Woo-hoo-hooo!
I thought you'd like that. [Laughter.]
That's something again! [Laughter.] Wheee!
Okay - DAC off.
That's something [garble].
[Garble]. Cycle one frame.
Okay [laughter]. Boy, I love stuff like that.
Now that's pretty spectacular.
It sure is. That's just right between the eyeballs.
Yes. You don't expect it. Oh, yes! Okay. Okay, lift the ... away. Oh, we got - we got a little time. No - there's no big rush.
Okay, remove DAC from window, cover lens, and run at 24 frames per second.
Yes.
Shutter speed, 1/500th, for 2 seconds.
Yes.
Cover lens?
Yes.
CMC Mode, Auto. Record the mag.
Okay, we're down to about - oh, 60 percent of the frame, I guess.
Sixty percent?
Sixty percent of the MAG, yes.
How about your frame?
100.
Okay.
Yes.
[Garble] what?
Now, which one you want to use? Use this one?
Okay, we got 1/125th, got...
What's your mag number? Need that.
[Garble]. Yes.
Okay [garble] get it up there and get it going, we'll be all right. [Garble]. Why don't you run one across this way? Now hold it.
Okay, I want back [garble]. Yes, that ought to do it. Run this one down through here.
[Garble].
What?
I don't think you guys'll make it, frankly.
No (grunt).
[Garble] back it off. Oh, yes, that's right. We don't move now, anyway.
Okay.
[Garble].
Did you let the [garble] down?
No.
[Garble]...
Yes.
...[garble].
Huh! (Sigh) Okay.
[Garble].
Yes, we got it. Is that what you got on there?
[Garble].
Rate's down.
[Garble].
Yes. That's - that's about right, Dave.
[Garble].
Huh?
[Garble].
Yes. Okay.
Did we do a P20?
Yes.
I thought we called P20 now, Al.
Yes, just recall P20. It should do it itself. No, if you get the Uplink Activity light, that means it's gone outside the 10-degree deadband, in which case you have to do a Verb 58 - to get back in.
Endeavour, this is Houston. Calling in the blind for Reacq and Narrow on the High Gain [Antenna]. [No answer.]
Hello, Endeavour, this is Houston requesting Reacq and Narrow on the High Gain [Antenna]. [No answer.]
Apollo 15, Apollo 15. Houston requesting Reacq and Narrow on the High Gain.
Hello, Houston; 15.
Hello, 15; this is Houston.
Okay, Joe. We're reading you and we were in Reacq and Narrow. Couldn't seem to pick you up, so we're back in Manual and Medium [beamwidth] now.
Okay, Al; we copy that. Thank you. While we're thinking about that one, got a couple of requests for you here. We'd like for you to turn on your RCS Propellant, Secondary. We're expecting a crossover in the D and C quads during the shape ullage, and we can, I guess, use those on now. And I've got some small changes to your Flight Plan when you're ready to copy. [Pause.]
Okay Joe, I'm ready to copy the changes in Flight Plan.
Okay, Jim. I assume you're reading me loud and clear. You're still a little bit - have a little noise in the background. If you have your Flight Plan in front of you, the first entry is at 217 plus 17 and it is an addition. "Retract Map Camera". [Pause.] The next one is at 217 plus 21. Addition: "Close Map Camera and Laser Experiment Covers". [Pause.] The third is at 217 plus 58; delete those two lines: "O2 heaters, three, Auto; O2 heaters 1 and 2, Off". Those are two deletions. [Pause.] Another deletion...
Okay. Let me read that back to you, Joe.
Okay, fine, Jim.
You have 217:17, retract the Mapping Camera and 217:21, close Map Camera and Laser Covers. And then the deletion at 217:58 of the O2 heaters, three, and O2 heaters 1 and 2. [Pause.]
That's correct, Jim. And the next change is a - it's a deletion at 218:02, and that is delete the "PCM cable" line, there. And down a couple of inches, at 218:08, an addition: "Map Camera and Laser Experiment Covers to Open, and extend Map Camera". Read back. [Pause.]
Okay. I understand to delete the PCM cable at 218:02, and then at 218:08, Map Camera and Laser Covers, Open, and Extend Mapping Camera.
That readback's correct and the next change is at 219:07; and once again, delete the "PCM cable" line. And at 219:17 add "Laser Altimeter, Off; [Pause.] Close Map Camera and Laser Experiment Covers", and delete Map Camera extension. And the last addition, that is to say the last change, is at 220 plus 05, delete the "PCM cable" line. Over.
Okay. I copied 220:05, delete the PCM cable, and go on back to [the] page fore - before, we deleted the PCM cable there at 219:07. And 219:17, a new item, Laser Altimeter, Off. Close Mapping Camera and Laser Experiment covers, and then delete the next line - the "Map Camera Track to Extend".
Sounds good, Jim, and that's all I have for the moment. We - we do want a verification that all four propellant secondaries are opened on your RCS, please. [Pause.]
Okay. That's verified. Just opened them.
Okay. Thank you.
Endeavour, this is Houston. We'd like Auto on the High Gain [Antenna], please, and we show your optics in the CMC Mode. We'd like that zeroed at your convenience, please. [Pause.]
Auto, zero.
Endeavour, Pan Camera Power, Off, please. [Pause.]
Rog. Pan Camera, Off.
Thank you.
Hello, Endeavour. This is Houston with photography PADs and a TEI-73 PAD, when you're ready. [Pause.]
Okay, Joe. I'm ready to copy the photo PADs. [Pause.]
Okay, Jim. I've got a Map Camera photo PAD, a Pan Camera PAD, and a Terminator photo PAD for you. And before I start, just a word of explanation. Because of your change of trajectory from what we considered a nominal one, we've got some details to add to the PAD that involve image-motion setting changes and exposure changes. And I'll read those in detail, in a moment. I just wanted to give you a word of explanation on it. The first PAD is the Map Camera photo PAD copied at 217 plus 10. [Pause.] And at 217 plus 10 it is T-start: 218 plus 16 plus 59, T-stop: 219 plus 16 plus 44. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. Copy. 218:16:59; 219:16:44. [Pause.]
That's correct, Jim. And if you'll turn the page now, I want you to delete two lines, one at 218 plus 35 and that is "Map Camera, Image Motion, Increase, talkback barber pole, On". Delete that, and delete the line at 218 plus 55 which reads, "Map Camera, Image Motion, Increase, talkback barber pole plus four steps" et cetera. And, instead, put in the instructions: At T-start, [pause] it should be barber pole plus four. At 218 plus 39 plus 00, barber pole plus three; and at 218:49 plus 00, barber pole plus four. Readback, please. [Pause.]
Okay, the instructions are that at T-start, it should be barber pole plus four; at 218 plus 39 plus 00, barber pole plus three; at 218 plus 49 plus 00, barber pole plus four. [Pause.]
That's correct, Jim. And those are your image-motion settings, and you're to delete the other two image-motion instructions in the Flight Plan. One at 218:35 and the other at 218:55, and - and I know you got that. The second...
Yes, I made those two deletions.
Okay, the second is the terminator photo PAD to copy at 218 plus 07. And it is T-start: 218 plus 15 plus 19. Over. [Pause.]
218:15:19.
Roger. And finally, the Pan Camera photo PAD. Copy at 218 plus 39. T-start: 218 plus 52 plus 55. T-stop: 219 plus 16 plus 44. And delete the two Pan Camera exposure lines. The first one at 218 plus 57. Delete that. And the second one at 219 plus 03. Delete that. And instead, use these exposure instructions. [Pause.] At 219 plus 00 plus 13, decrease. At 219 plus 00 plus 50, normal. At 219 plus 06 plus 35, decrease. At 219 plus 07 plus 28, normal. Readback please. [Pause.]
Okay, I understand the instructions on the Pan Camera. Exposure at 219 plus 00 plus 13, it's decrease; 219 plus 00 plus 50, it's normal; 219 plus 06 plus 35, it's decrease; 219 plus 07 plus 28, it goes back to normal.
That's right, Jim. And give me the T-start and T-stop times, please. [Pause.]
Okay, T-start was 218:52:55, and 219:16:44.
Sounds fine, and I'm holding TEI-73 PAD when you're ready for that. [Pause.]
Stand by one, Joe.
Okay, Joe. I'm ready here for the TEI PAD.
Roger, Jim. It's TEI-73, SPS/G&N: 36188; plus 0.63, plus 0.98; 221:47:42.81; plus 2883.3, minus 0661.3, minus 0195.5; 179, 128, 350. All the rest is NA. Ullage, four jet, 12 seconds. Other: the PAD assumes no shape maneuver, and it assumes the lift-off REFSMMAT. Over. [Pause.]
Okay, Joe. TEI-73, PAD readback. SPS/G&N; 36188; plus 0.63, plus 0.98; 221:47:42.81; plus 2883.3, minus 0661.3, minus 0195.5; 179, 128, 350. Four-jet, 12 seconds; PAD assumes no shape burn, and lift-off REFSMMAT. Over.
Okay, Jim. Right on. Thank you.
Endeavour, this is Houston. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Joe.
Roger, Jim. Just for your own thinking, we'd like to advise you that we have reviewed the cue card F-K1 for the plane change burn that Al copied, and it's update is still valid for your shape burn later on. And we're in the process of going over your SPS thrusting procedures on G5-1 in the checklist, and we see very - only very minor changes that we'll be coming up to you with regarding your burn later on today, so I think things are pretty well in hand down here. Over.
Okay, we copy. Thank you, Joe.
Another item regarding that, the FAO wants me to urge you again just to follow the Flight Plan items regarding SIM bay operation before and after these burns coming up, and we'll get no - we'll get into no problems at all. Over.
Rog. Understand.
Endeavour, this is Houston. We have no problems at all as you come up on 5 minutes before LOS. Al, we do have a question for you, if this is a good time to ask it. Over.
Yeah; go ahead, Joe.
Rog, Alfredo. We're sitting down here wondering if, perhaps, at sometime over the past few days you've gotten a visual on the Mass Spectrometer boom and unit, and if so, has it been possible at all to determine which direction the Mass Spec. might be twisting as you move through the orbit over the Moon? Over. [Pause.]
Yeah. I have seen that, Joe, and I've - haven't watched a great deal of twisting and, as a matter of fact, I was rather surprised that there wasn't more twist than what I observed. I may not have picked up the maximum deflection, but I only observed about a - maybe a 5- or 10-degree rotation on the end on the boom, and, as I recall, as I was looking at it from inside the spacecraft, the rotation was counter-clockwise.
Okay, Al. That's interesting information. We don't necessarily expect it to have rotated more, but just wondering if you had some good visual data for us, and that's excellent. Another comment, and it's more in the way of a reminder; during your EVA, we're going to ask you to look very closely at the V over H sensor, and the symptoms we've had concerning that sensor down here, is as though it has a small crack in the lens or perhaps there's foreign contamination of some kind down in the barrel. And we're going to ask you to look particularly for either a crack, or contamination in the barrel during the EVA. Just wanted to lay that one on you now in case we forgot it later on. We'll most likely remind you of it later on.
Roger, Joe. I understand that one. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, we'd like a Pro on the P20 now, please. [Pause.]
Okay, that's in work, Joe.
Roger; Jim. Thanks. [Pause.]
Yeah.
And, Endeavour, requesting you configure DSE now, please.
Okay.
Back to normal now.
Okay. [Garble].
Okay.
[Garble]?
No, [garble] 15.
Endeavour. Recall the 50 18 and get the attitude, please.
