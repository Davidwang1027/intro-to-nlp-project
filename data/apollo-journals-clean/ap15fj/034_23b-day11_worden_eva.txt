15, this is Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 15, this is Houston. [No answer.]
15, this is Houston, broadcasting in the blind, with a request that, if possible, we bring back Dave's LCG. If it's already stowed in too inaccessible a place in the - in the jettison bag, don't bother. But if you can possibly save it, please bring it back.
Okay. Sorry, Houston, we were getting suited there, and didn't realize we were off comm; but copied your request. Let us think about it for a minute.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Well, Houston, I guess that it's a good reason we're about an hour ahead. So we'll go ahead and dig it out. [Pause.]
That's your choice, Dave.
Well, we're sort of ahead, expecting little things like that to pop up.
Fine.
Say, Houston, by the way, the LCG you'll get back is the one I wore on the third EVA only. [Long pause.]
Roger; Dave. That's fine. That's the one we'd like.
Okay. Okay. [Long pause.]
And 15, whenever Al has a quiet moment, I have several prebriefing questions to send up to him about what to look for on the V over H sensor.
Okay, give us about an hour for that, then we'll be able to talk to you.
Very good.
15, this is Houston. We'd like to have Manual [pointing] on the High Gain whenever one of you has a chance to get there. No need to answer.
Let me do it.
Okay. Going Manual.
Okay, Houston. Apollo 15.
15, this is Houston. Go ahead. [Pause.]
We're all suited up, and down to the comm check portion of the EVA prep, and we're ready to talk to you about whatever you'd like to talk about.
Roger. Stand by. [Long pause.]
I guess the main thing we have to talk about is the inspection of the V over H sensor of the Pan Camera. Are you ready to listen, Al? [Pause.]
Okay. He can read you, but he's got to reconfigure his panel in order to talk to you, so we'll do that.
Okay, Karl, how do you read me now?
Loud and clear, Al. Hey, on this V over H sensor, I have a set of five steps, or five questions that we'd like to have for you to have in your mind.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. Number 1 is, inspect the general area - this is sort of a general point of view - inspect the general area around the V over H sensor and comment on any evidence of thermal or mechanical degradation. And 2, 3, 4, and 5 are sort of more specifically. Number 2. Is there any evidence of V over H sensor lens cracking, or debris on the lens? In other words, have a good check of the lens itself. Number 3. Is any large amount of the black paint around the V over H sensor opening missing? Number 4. Is the plume shield in place around the V over H sensor opening? And the plume shield is what I'd generally call the - or - the - it's the guard around the lens sticking out about 3 inches [75 mm] there. And, number 5. Is anything obviously obstructing the V over H sensor field of view? [Pause.]
Okay, Karl. We got all those.
Okey doke. No other special questions at the moment. Stand by. [Pause.]
Okay.
Okay. We'll proceed on here then.
Incidentally, I guess we're - we both understand each other on the status of the Mapping Camera? So far as you know, it hasn't retracted. Is that correct?
That is our understanding at this point. I'll let you know when I get out.
Roger. [Pause.]
Oh, Al. One more point that I overlooked down here, and that is, the people here would like to have you look at the Mass Spec. boom, Al, if it's at all feasible. If it's not convenient to look down at the base of that boom and look at the coils, forget it; but if you can get a look in there, we would expect to find a coil crossover jamming down in the base there, and we'd like to have your visual confirmation of that.
Roger, Karl. I had intended to do that.
Very good. [Long pause.]
Rog. That's on.
Net comm, Off.
Net comm, Off.
S-band T/R.
S-band T/R.
[Garble.]
Normal.
Intercom T/R.
T/R.
[Garble.]
Off. [Long pause.]
Rog.
And Houston, Endeavour. I guess the comm's acceptable to you down there on - with Al on VOX. Is that correct?
Roger. We're reading him loud and clear.
Roger. [Pause.]
Press Alarm, On; tone, On.
[Garble] Off?
Off. [Long pause.]
On. [Long pause.]
Go ahead. [Long pause.]
900. [Long pause.]
Rog, Repress to Off. [Pause.]
Flashlight. Flashlight. [Pause.] Yep, got it. It's okay. It's off. Panel 600. Go.
Emergency O2 Valve, Closed.
Closed. [Long pause.]
No, I'm negative. [Garble] panel 8, front. [Long pause.]
[Garble.] [Long pause.]
Just. [Pause.]
15, we'd like to have Omni Charlie. [Pause.]
Roger. Omni Charlie.
Left to counterclockwise. It's On.
It's on. [Long pause.]
Good.
15, this is Houston. We'd like to get the High Gain Antenna up, if that's possible. [Pause.]
Rog. We'll do that.
Okay. Stand by. I'll get the High Gain. [Long pause.]
Okay. High Gain?
Roger; and thank you.
You should have it. [Pause.]
Negative. Coming unstowed. [Pause.]
They're installed.
[Garble.]
[Garble.]
[Garble.]
It's attached.
Don OPS. Connect straps to adapter bracket.
In work. [Long pause.]
Okay. Wait. [Long pause.]
Wait a minute. Let's get the straps up. [Long pause.]
Okay.
Okay. Snap all the flaps. [Pause.]
Now, I'm on SCU whenever - Whenever you're ready.
Yes, I'm disconnected. [Long pause.]
All verified. Rog. Got you. [Pause.]
Okay.
You can leave them off. [Long pause.]
Down in the left-hand LEB, Jim. Bring it up with gloves and helmet, gloves inside. [Long pause.]
Cabin pressure, 5.2 [psi].
Yeah.
Cabin pressure, 5.5.
Cabin pressure's approaching 6, and I'll crack the side hatch valve just a bit.
Yep.
...valve is on there now. Keep an eye on it.
Rog. [Long pause.]
All locked.
Okay.
You guys do your integrity check before I put my helmet and gloves on. [Pause.]
In case I'd have something else closed.
Cabin pressure, 5.4. [Long pause.]
Okay. O2 Flow High, pegged.
Your light's on. [Pause.]
O2 Flow High, pegged. [Pause.]
Vents.
Vents all closed. [Long pause.]
It's ready.
Side hatch valve coming on full open. [Long pause.]
Rog. That and my SCM. Okay? That'll hold steady.
...pressure and temperature...
Yeah.
...suit pressure reading?
Suit pressure's reading about - pound and a half above cabin. [Long pause.]
Cabin pressure's running about 5.9.
I'll pump it down a little bit. [Long pause.]
Jim. Stand by one. Get the cabin pressure down.
Okay. [garble] valve's, closed. SCS, closed. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15. The suit circuit looks pretty good up here. How's it look to you?
Roger, 15. It looks good to us down here.
Okay. Thank you. [Long pause.]
SCU is done. 603 is On. Verified. [Long pause.]
Okay. Let's get the helmet on first. [Pause.]
Okay. Purge valve.
Got it. [Pause.] It's activated. [Pause.]
Rog.
Pull the OPS down there, would you, Jim? [Pause.]
Pull it. Pull it further.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Can you [garble]?
Got it. [Long pause.]
Okay. Down and locked.
O2 coming off. [Long pause.]
Locked. [Pause.]
Okay. I'll be pressurizing. [Long pause.]
[Garble.] [Long pause.]
[Garble] 3. [Long pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay. Stable at 3.9.
Turn it off.
[Garble] Verified, off.
Yeah, it's okay.
6. [Pause.]
Got it? Okay. It's off.
Locked.
High. You've got the temp. [Pause.] Can you reach it? Hook that strap in for me, too, would you, please? No.
15, Houston. We note that your cabin pressure's up to 6. You might consider dumping it down.
Roger, Houston. [Long pause.]
Hooked.
Tell me when my temp [garble] anyone.
Yeah. [Long pause.]
Okay. [Pause.]
Reading 4.0.
Okay. [Long pause.]
It's off. Warning tone's on.
Decay was about .1. It's on. O2 [garble] is on.
Reading 4 on stable.
Off. [Pause.]
Reading 300. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston; 15. We've got a good integrity check on the CMP, and standing by for a Go for depress from... [Long pause.]
Dave, would you turn my suit diverter valve, please.
We copy, 15. And you have a Go for depress.
Roger.
Are they vertical now? [Pause.]
Other side too. Two of 'em.
Yeah. [Pause.]
Okay. You guys ready? Okay. Houston, 15. The side hatch dump valve is coming open.
15, Houston copies. [Long pause.]
Rog. [Pause.]
Want to stop there?
Well, okay. Think it's probably easier than I can. [Long pause.]
Reading 4.0. Go to 'em.
Yeah, it does. [Long pause.]
Reading 3.8 on mine. [Long pause.]
Roger. Fine. [Long pause.]
Okay.
Yeah. It makes a difference. It's still flowing into the cabin.
How can you read me? You read me okay? Good. [Long pause.]
You hear my VOX cut in and out? Good.
Yeah. Okay. You ready? [Pause.]
I suspect that SCU is forward enough to keep it there. [Long pause.]
It'll hold. Now. [Pause.]
It's released. It's in the yellow?
No. We've missed it.
Yeah. I can't see it. Jim, can you see the indicator?
I can't either, can you?
Stand by one.
Rog. [Garble.] [Pause.]
Houston, 15. We're getting ready to open the hatch. How does everything look to you down there?
Roger, Al. Everything's looking good to us here.
...out, Dave.
Okay? Unlatch. Unlatch. Ready? Rog. [Pause.]
No.
15, Houston. We don't see the TV camera on yet.
The hatch is open.
Huh. Oh, we haven't got it out yet. We'll have it out there in a minute. It should be on though.
Okay. I got the latch - the handle and latch.
Rog. Rog.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay. [Garble].
[Garble] zero. Clips. [Pause.]
Jettison bag is gone. [Pause.] And jettison bag number 2. [Long pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. You should be getting a picture about now.
Roger, 15. We're getting a signal. [Long pause.]
Okay. [Pause.]
Okay. Fine. First thing is that the map - the Mapping Camera is all the way out. [Pause.]
Okay. [Pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
15, this is Houston. We're getting a clear picture now, but the aiming of the TV camera is poor. Is it possible to open the hatch wider?
Yeah, that's what - we're - we're looking at that, too. Stand by one, and we'll do that. [Long pause.]
Yeah, I can see the TV is pointed right at the Command Module there. Right at the interface.
That's affirm.
Push it back a little there, Jim.
No problem.
Okay.
That's excellent.
You should have a picture at a man in space.
Very good. [Pause.]
Okay. You ready, Jim? I'll work my way down. Okay, it's reading 4. Okay. [Long pause.]
We'll have your picture back in a minute, Houston. We're turning on the 16-millimeter.
We copy.
Yes. [Pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay. I'm in the foot restraint.
Yeah, that's good work up there, Al. [Long pause.]
Okay, the Pan Camera cassette is tethered. There's the pip pin. [Long pause.]
Good.
Get it inside there, if you can, Jim. Get it inside. [Long pause.]
Okay.
Rog. Would you like to exchange - would you like to get hold of it? [Laughter.] [Pause.]
That's the Pan Camera [cassette], right.
Okay, Houston. The Pan Camera is safely inside.
Hold it.
Jim, hold this.
Beautiful job, Al baby. Remember - remember, there is no hurry up there at all.
Rog, Karl. I'm enjoying it. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. Rest break. We'll take a look at the V over H sensor.
Very good.
Uh, hum, I see nothing on the V over H sensor. There's no back - black paint missing. There's nothing obscuring the field of view. The glass is not cracked. [Pause.]
The shield is not obstructing the field of view. There's nothing in the way, Karl.
We...
It's perfectly clear.
We copy your report, Al. Thank you.
Okay. And as I look around, the Mass Spec. is - oh, it looks like about - not quite in - the cover. It looks like maybe it's the cover that's jammed. Yes, in fact, it is the cover that's jammed. See?
Roger, Al. We copy. That was most unexpected news.
No, I can't tell from here. I can't really - I can't really tell from here, Karl, whether it's the cover or not. I thought the cover was jammed. One corner of the cover is overlapping a - side section of insulation which I wasn't expecting it to. But it doesn't seem to be - it doesn't put any force on it - on the Mass Spec. If I could get around and take a look at it. [Pause.] The Mass Spec. is in the guide pins, and the Mass Spec. looks like as it is fully retracted. [Pause.] The Mass Spec. is fully retracted, Karl.
Roger, Al. We're reading you loud and clear.
Any - any diffi - any difficulties with the talkback has to be associated with that cover, because the cover is not closed. How far through the slot should the guide pin come on the - on the reel?
Stand by, Al.
Okay. 'Cause I can see a guide pin coming through. You do that, and I'll get the map - Mapping Camera.
Okay, Jim. I'm ready to bring the other one back. [Long pause.]
Hey, Al. It looks like you're running a pass up there. That's beautiful. [Long pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
Jim, you look absolutely fantastic against that Moon back there. That is really a most unbelievable, remarkable thing.
Okay, Houston. The Mapping Camera cassette is inside.
We copy. [Pause.]
Houston, is there anything else you want me to check in the SIM bay before we go back in?
Al, we'd be...
Is there anything on the Mapping Camera I can check?
Al, we'd be pleased to have any general comments you had about the SIM bay experiments, otherwise than what we specifically asked you. Did everything look in order?
Okay. Well, everything looked good, as far as I could tell, except for the cover on the Mass Spec., and the fact that the Mapping Camera is up. Maybe I could take another quick check back here and see if I can see anything on the Mapping Camera.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Okay. You ready guys?
All right. [Long pause.]
Oh, just a second. I've got get the mast and get the TV. [Long pause.]
Okay. TV coming in. Got it, Dave? Okay.
Okay, take your time.
I - I'm doing fine. [Long pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
Hung up - on something. [Long pause.]
Ah, yeah, it's about the same place it was when we opened the hatch. [Long pause.]
Okay. Hatch is locked.
Neutral. Gear box is in latch. [Pause.]
Can you do it, Dave? Okay.
15, Houston. You can turn off the TV anytime you like.
Let us get depr - get pressurized first, Karl.
Okay. [Pause.]
Can you get it there?
Okay.
Very good. [Pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
Tell me when to close it. [Pause.] That's it. [Pause.]
[Garbled.] Take it down here before it's too - okay, okay.
Okay?
I said, I wish I were back outside. It's hell in here. Okay.
Closed. [Pause.]
I can't. No. [Pause.] Yeah. That's okay, Jim. [Pause.]
How's that? There we go. Now we should get our positions straight. You see it now, Dave? Okay. Make sure we got a good seal. [Long pause.]
Cool it here for a minute.
Okay, Houston; 15. It looks like we got a good seal. How's it look down there? [Long pause.]
15, Houston. Your seal looks good to us.
Okay, thank you. Okay, 601, Open?
It's Open.
Monitor Repress O2 indicator to zero.
and it looks zero now, Dave? [Pause.]
Okay. So, you let your umbilical flow bring every - the cabin up to 3.
Rog. [Long pause.]
That's very nicely done. That's about - 22 minutes. Which is just about what we figured. You went back and looked at all that stuff. So that's just about right.
It's fun out there, isn't it?
Mm-hmm. Should have stayed longer.
(Laughter) You done good. You made a lot of people back there very happy.
Roll over and let me take another look again.
Well, I'll tell you what, your - your left arm or something's covering up the light over there.
The OPS is, I guess.
Really bad lights in here.
Okay, there. I can see it now.
We're at 2.4, about. So we'll just let your flow bring it up to 3. Gee, I had a great view on the TV. Did you turn the TV off, Jim?
No, I didn't...
I'll turn it off.
Can you reach it?
Yes. There. Thought I turned it off.
Can you reach the Scientific TV switch? The S-band TV switch, Jim?
No, not yet, Dave.
Okay. Maybe I can. No.
I don't think there's any rush on that, is it?
No.
Fif - 15, Houston. As long as we have the TV camera on, go - go to Average, and we should get a better picture down here.
Well, it's just down in the LEB sort of stowed away, but we'll do that. [Pause.]
We're just not in a position to get the panel 3 switch right now.
We - we copy, and that's fine. [Long pause.]
You may have something on your picture, now.
Cabin pressure rate is coming up.
They're out of lockup.
I'll get it. [Long pause.]
Here, give me it first, Al.
Got it.
PGA pressure. [Long pause.]
[Garble].
Yes.
[Garble].
On.
Why don't you do it so I don't get my gloves dirty. Get my helmet. Get that stuff off and leave them.
15, Houston. We see your cabin at 6.1 [psi]. You might want to keep a close eye on that.
Okay; we'll do that. Thank you.
