Dave, you want to verify that the dump valve's in Auto?
Roger. Standby one. [Pause.]
Verify.
Okay, I'll go ahead and start equalizing the pressure.
Okay, good. [Long pause.]
And, Falcon; Flight - or rather, Falcon, Houston. FIDO's on pins and needles for your TPI solution if you can get a moment to read it to us.
Rog, we'll do it right now. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. I assume that you got the recycle before we went around the corner there.
That's affirm.
Okay, on the final [rendezvous burn] comp[utation], I'll read PGNS, AGS and CMC, if you are ready to copy them, in that order, in local-vertical coordinates.
Roger. Ready.
Okay. For the PGNS: plus 70.3, plus 5.9, minus 17.7. For the AGS: plus 70.4, plus 5.9, minus 19.1. The CMC: minus 69.1, minus 6.1, plus 16.1. We burned the PGNS on time, and we had about a 4-foot-per-second overburn on the APS which we trimmed out to 2/10ths.
Copy. [Pause.]
Okay, the residuals were - for the PGNS after the trim - were plus .2, plus .2, and minus .4.
Copy. And assume midcourses were...
Rog. We'll give you those too. [Long pause.]
Okay, and I'll give you the same answers for midcourse 1 if you're ready to copy, Houston.
Okay.
Okay, PGNS was minus 1.1, 0, and minus 1.1. AGS was minus 1.5, 0, and minus 3.0. CS - CSM, plus 1.5, minus .2, plus 1.9. And we burned the PGNS solution to 0, .1 and .2.
Thank you, Dave, that's fine. Appreciate it.
Okay, you want midcourse 2?
No, we'll take your PGNS - we'll take all the rest of them; we'll get them later.
Okay, fine. It was pretty smooth all the way, everything looked nice, and the data went in very well, and I thought it was a super rendezvous.
Very good. Getting home's the main thing.
Yeah, but you know, these systems are just magnificent.
Yeah, they sure are, Dave. Okay, we suggest you press right along with your transfer and cleaning up.
Rog. We're in work right now.
And whenever Jim's ready to do the targeting, we'll read him a PAD on that.
Okay, stand by, we'll give you a call. [Long pause.]
Okay, Ed. I'm ready to copy the impact PAD.
Okay, understand you're ready for the LM impact PAD, Jim; is that correct?
Yes, if that's what you have to pass.
Okay, it's a P30 PAD. 179:06:22.50; Noun 81s, minus 0121.9, plus 0056.0, plus 0148.8; 0071.1, minus 0037.1, 0200.3; 1:27; 047, 174. The rest is NA. And the LM weight: is 5444. [Pause.]
Roger, Readback for P30 PAD. 179:06:22.50; minus 0121.9, plus 0056.0, plus 0148.8; 0071.1, minus 0037.1, 0200.3; 1:27; 47, 174. And LM weight is 5444.
Good readback, Jim. [Long pause.]
And, Falcon; Houston. The computer's yours.
Rog.
And we want to leave it in Data, of course. [Pause.]
Okay, we'll leave it in Data. It's all yours now. [Long pause.]
And, Endeavour; Houston. Before you get LOS and get too busy with the transfer, I need to give you a camera photo PAD for the next pass. [Pause.]
Okay. Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, this is the one at 174:50, Al. T-start - it's for the Map Camera - T-start, 174:50:04; T-stop, 175:49:36. Your Image Motion BP plus 4 at T-start, and BP at 175:30:00. And your Pan Camera photo PAD, to be copied at 175:20. T-start, 175:34:32; T-stop is 36:52. [Pause.]
Roger, Ed. Understand Mapping Camera photo PAD is T-start, 174:50:04; T-stop, 175:49:26. And at T-start, you want Image Motion to go barber pole plus 4.
That's affirm.
And, at 175:30, understand you want Image Motion to go to barber pole.
That's affirm, Al. And the correct time for the T-stop on that was 175:49:36. [Pause.]
Understand, 49:36. [Long pause.]
And the Pan Camera photo PAD is T-start, 175:35:42; T-stop, 175:36:52.
Roger. The T-start, 175:34:32, T-stop is good. [Pause.]
Understand, T-start is 175:34:32.
That's a good readback now, Al.
Yeah, it's pressurized, Jim. Can you read me? Okay, tunnel's pressurized and I'm up in it now, checking the latching.
Hello, Houston. The Falcon is back on its roost and going to sleep.
Very good. [Pause.]
She's all yours now, Ed. We're going to go off comm and put her to bed.
Okay, one item, Dave. You're not marking these bags before you head them down, are you.
The bags are all numbered. We've got the collection bags in the cover bags with the proper numbers on them, and that was all we're planning to do.
Okay, you're not helping him with the stowage when you pass them in, are you? I would change your Flight Plan if you did; otherwise, I'll just give it to him. [Pause.]
Well, I guess the best thing would be to go ahead and give it to him, because we'll just pass them over then.
Okay, I've given them to him already. Thank you.
Yeah, that fine. He - he's got a much better handle on the stowage over there anyway than we do.
Endeavour, Houston.
Houston, Endeavour. Go ahead.
Al, we observed when you were in P79, just before the docking, that you got a POO DOO. Do you have any words on that. [Pause.]
No, I don't, Ed. [Long pause.]
And, Endeavour; Houston. We're going to have to update your Flight Plan with a couple of items before you go around the corner, whenever you can get around to it.
Okay, Ed, let's go ahead and do them now.
Roger. And, Al, give us a Verb 74 when I'm talking to you.
Rog. Verb 74.
Okay, the first Flight Plan update is the - at 174:12. [Pause.]
Okay, go ahead.
Okay, where it says the "Mapping Camera Laser Experiment Covers, Open," et cetera, et cetera. Delete that.
Rog. Go ahead.
And the second line after that, the "Map Camera Track," et cetera, et cetera; delete that, we're going to move those to 174:40. [Pause.]
Okay, understand.
Okay, down a little bit in the next group of words where it says "Laser Altimeter, On" at 174:17; we're going to scratch that. [Pause.]
Okay, scratch Laser Altimeter.
We're going to move that to 174:49. [Pause.]
Roger. Move to 174:49.
Okay, and at 175:49, going to add a - another Laser Altimeter, Off. [Pause.]
Rog, understand. At 175:49, Laser Altimeter, Off.
Okay, the next item is at 1 - Stand by on that a minute. And at 175:54 [means 175:58], delete the Laser Altimeter, Off. [Long pause.]
Understand. At 175:58, delete Laser Altimeter, Off.
That's affirm.
Okay.
And at 176:02, the next page, right after all those words, we want to add in the "Map Camera" - that's about 176:02 - "Map Camera Laser Experiment Covers, Close, Talkback's barberpole slash gray, then Off." [Long pause.]
Looks like that item came down there about 4 minutes later, Al. [Pause.]
Roger that, I see it now.
Yeah, I just now saw it, too. I presume they want it moved up there a few minutes. And at 178:02; Oh, sorry about that - at 177:56, put in a "Logic Power, two, Off." [Long pause.]
Okay, I understand Logic Power, both of them, Off, at 177:56.
Rog. Next page, 178:02, "Laser Altimeter, On." Delete. [Long pause.]
Delete "Laser Altimeter, On," at 178:02.
Okay. And at 179:40, following page, delete "Laser Altimeter, Off" - and about 179:41, delete those two lines, "Map Camera Laser Experiment Covers" and "Logic Power, two, Off." Delete those.
Okay. Delete the three lines at 179:40, "Laser Altimeter," "Mapping Camera Covers," and "Logic Power, Off." Delete those three lines.
Okay. I think we got them all that time, Al. Thank you.
Okay.
And, Endeavour; Houston. If you can holler at Dave and Jim, remind them that - to get their radiation meters out of their pockets. We'd still like those readings we didn't get earlier.
Roger, Houston.
Okay, Endeavour; Houston. Can we have Auto on the High Gain [Antenna]? And request Falcon to go to Aft Omni as he goes over the hill, or after he's over the hill.
Okay. You want Falcon to go to Aft Omni.
Yeah, at LOS. And you're about 3 and a half minutes from LOS now.
Okay, I'm in Auto and they're going to go to Aft Omni at LOS.
That's affirm. [Pause.] And ask them when they do that to verify Track Mode, Slew.
And, Endeavour, we're about 40 seconds from LOS; see you on the other side.
Okay, Ed. Thanks much.
Apollo 15, Houston. Standing by.
Houston, 15. [We're] still in the midst of doing a little house cleaning.
Okay; kind of figured that, Al.
Endeavour, Houston. Would you ask Falcon to switch to Forward Omni?
Roger, Houston.
And, Al. Do you want to verify - verify that you got your Mapping Camera started at 174:50?
Roger, Ed. Was 1 minute late on that - on the Mapping Camera, but we got it started at 1 - at 174:51.
Okay, Al. Thank you.
Hey, go to forward Omni.
Okay.
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Roger, Ed. One other thing, I didn't get the P52 in.
Okay, I understand, no P52.
Affirm.
Al, I'll keep track of your cameras for you and give you a warning on the stops and starts.
Okay; if you would, that would help. [Long pause.]
15, Houston. Give me Reacq and Narrow [on the High Gain Antenna], please.
Okay, Reacq and Narrow.
... the pilot valve...
15, Houston. We're having a lot of trouble with the LM comm. Apparently, we're right at the midst of the Omni. Let's try aft again, please. [Pause.]
Houston, I was talking with Dave. Say again.
Roger. Let's try the LM Aft Omni again, please.
15, Houston.
Rog, Houston. Go ahead.
How about the Gamma-ray Gain switch? Step it three times for us, please, Al.
Okay, three times.
Apollo 15, Houston.
Houston, 15.
Al, we're going to change your Mapping Camera procedures. I'm going to call them to you on time rather than read them to you now. So press on, and I'll give you a warning here in about 5 or 6 minutes.
Yeah, that'd be fine, Ed. Just give me a couple minute warnings, so I can get over to the camera. As you probably know, the LEB [Lower Equipment Bay] Timer's not working.
Rog. I'll keep you posted on time; press on.
Okay.
Apollo 15, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Al, we observe that your - you've got P00 up instead of P20. Better check your attitude and get her back in P20, and let's see if our camera is pointed at anything.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15.
Go ahead.
Rog. That just happened about 15 seconds ago. You must have caught it just as it went to P00. And I don't think we're even out of the deadband.
Very good. And Al - just stand by. We still got a couple of minutes, yet. What I'm going to do is have you retract the Mapping Camera with it still running and then turn it off. We're running a little test on it. And I'll call that for you in a couple of minutes.
Okay.
Apollo 15, Houston. Stand by to retract the Mapping Camera.
Okay, standing by.
Mark. Start retracting. [Pause.]
Okay; it's retracting now.
[It will] take about 4 minutes, Al, and I'll call you after that.
Okay.
Okay. Apollo 15, Houston. Turn your Mapping Camera, Off. [Pause.]
Okay, Ed. Mapping Camera going Off.
Roger. The Laser Altimeter, Off. And the Map Camera Laser Covers, Closed.
Okay, Laser Altimeter's Off.
And I'll have the Pan Camera T-start here in just about 2 minutes. I'll call you and give you 15 or 20 seconds warning.
Okay.
15, Houston. Stand by for T-start on the Pan Camera. [Pause.]
Standing by.
Mark. T-start, Pan Camera.
15, Houston; stand by for Pan Camera, Off. [Pause.]
15, Roger.
Mark. Pan Camera, Off.
It's Off.
Okay, Al. That completes all that for us. Thank you.
Okay, Ed. Thank you very much.
Go ahead, 15. [Long pause.]
Okay, Apollo 15; Houston. We're getting a little itchy for some LM data. We'd like for them to bring up the steerable [antenna] if they can, please, at 146 and 29.
Okay, Ed. [I'll] have them bring up the steerable.
Roger. Angles 146 and plus 29. [Pause.]
Understand. Angles 146 and plus 29. [Long pause.]
And, 15, we verify that your Pan Camera [lens]'s [tucked] in, and you can turn the Power, Off, on it.
Okay.
Apollo 15, Houston. You can start your maneuver to jettison attitude at any time. And I have a slight update to the attitude. [Pause.]
Okay, Houston; 15. Standby one.
Roger. Standing by.
Apollo 15, Houston. Your Gamma-ray Gainstep, Shield, Off, please. [Pause.]
Okay, Ed. Gamma-ray, Gain, Shield, going Off. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Okay, Ed, it looks like the chaos is slowing down a little bit here, if you want to talk about the Flight Plan.
Okay, Al. You can start your maneuvering to your LM jettison attitude most anytime. And I'll update the attitude for you. It's Roll, 14; Pitch, 38 and Yaw 344. [Pause.]
Rog, Ed. Understand the LM jettison attitude is Roll, 014; Pitch, 038 and Yaw, 344.
Rog. And the time is 177:20:33. [Pause.]
Understand. The jettison time is 177:20:33.00.
That's right; and the CSM Sep time here is 177:25:33. [Long pause.]
Understand. The CSM Sep is 177:25:33.
Rog. And your CSM weight for your DAP is 36370. [Pause.]
Understand. DAP weight is 36370.
Rog. And I'll call this Gamma-ray, Gainstep, Shield, back On, Al. We want to let it go for 10 minutes here.
Okay, Gainstep comes back to Shield, On.
Negative, negative. I'll call it back On in 10 minutes.
Roger. Roger. Understand.
Apollo 15, Houston.
Houston, 15; go ahead.
Rog. Would you ask Dave and Jim to make sure that we go ahead and get steps 4 and 5 on page 14 of their checklist before LOS here? And then, soon as we get into attitude, we can take a look at all this before we go LOS. We got about 16 minutes.
Okay, understand. That's steps 4 and 5 on page 14.
That's affirm. [Pause.]
And, Apollo 15; Houston. Also, go ahead and get the P30 and et cetera, et cetera. [Pause.]
Rog. Understand. Go ahead and get the P30 in the LM.
And there is no update to the TIG. It's good as given to you earlier. [Pause.]
Rog. Understand. TIG is good. [Pause.]
And, Al, stand by to turn the Gamma-ray, Gainstep, Shield, On.
Gamma-ray, Shield, On.
Okay, Mark, On and let's take the Map Camera, On switch to Standby and the Map Camera, Image Motion, Off. [Pause.]
Okay. Map Camera, Standby, Image Motion, Off.
That about cleans us up, Al.
Okay, Ed. Thank you much for your help. [Pause.]
Oh, Ed, I'm back on comm, over in the Falcon.
Okay, Jim. Sounds good. Should be in attitude in just a minute. And your angles, 205 and 70, as in the Flight Plan, should be good. And we're about 13 minutes from LOS.
Okay. Do you have any updates for me before we have LOS?
Negative. All we wanted to do was just - the guidance system's state vector's okay and configured before LOS, and I don't believe we have an update. I'll check. [Long pause.]
Falcon, Houston. We'd just like to complete down through step 1 or 2 of configure AGS before LOS. And, Endeavour, if you can give us an Accept, we'll shoot you an uplink before LOS.
Okay, getting Accept.
Falcon copies. [Pause.]
You got Accept.
Understand.
Ed, can you get for - the P30 load here for me as I go through it.
Okay, stand by one. [Pause.] Okay. Go ahead. Got the first one.
Okay, how does that look?
Looks good.
Looks good here, Jim.
Okay, I'll [press] Pro[ceed] on this one. [Long pause.]
Okay, I'm going to go to P00, Ed.
Rog, Jim. That one looks okay, too. I don't see much of it.
That's right. [Pause.] Okay, do we have a Go for closeout?
Give us a 470 readout on the DEDA [Data Entry and Display Assembly, part of the AGS], please.
Okay. You have it. [Long pause.]
Okay. And, Jim, can you verify that you've done all of step 2 on the comm?
Yes, I meant Slew on the Track Mode. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jim. You're Go for closeout. The next time we see the LM, you'll all be buttoned up. So suggest you make a very careful check of the items from now on.
Okay; thank you, Ed.
And, Endeavour. It's your computer.
Roger, Ed.
Okay, Endeavour, Houston. We're a minute and 20 seconds from LOS. Your ascent CapCom's going off duty, and I'll see you back on Earth. It's been a lot of fun getting you up here.
Okay, Ed. You're - thanks a million, pal. You've been a great help, and it was fun talking to you.
Hey, Ed; Falcon. Looks like we just about got things cleaned up here.
Very good, guys. We'll see you in a few days. Thanks a lot.
Okay, Ed, thank you.
Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
Hello, Houston; 15. How are you?
Roger. Doing fine down here. Can you fellows confirm LM closed out and ready for jett[ison of LM].?
Rog. LM's closed out, and we're just now running our pressure integrity check, and we'll be all set in a jiffy.
Roger.
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Okay, we're going to be a few minutes here. We got to put some LCG plugs in our suits and it's going to take probably about 10 or 15 minutes to get all that done.
Okay, and we'd like a verification from Al that [the] X-ray [Spectrometer] is in Standby and X-ray/Alpha Covers are Closed before jett and Sep burn. [Pause.]
Okay. We - we'll get that for you when we get squared away here.
Yeah.
Apollo 15, Houston. [Pause.]
Houston, Apollo 15. Go.
Say, Dave, beautiful job there today all the way around. Hey, one quick question - how come you guys need plugs for those suits?
Well, because, apparently, the LCG connection on the inside won't hold an air seal, so we're getting them taken care of with these special - extra little blue plugs we got that are airtight on the inside. [Long pause.]
At least that's our first guess of - of why we didn't get a good suit integrity check or didn't even get a good buildup in the suit pressure.
Rog. We - we had a complete misunderstanding on that, so that's the reason I asked the question, because we thought those plugs only were required when the LCG was not on. We're trying to crack that one for you down here, Dave. There's something screwy here. [Pause.]
Okay. Well, we'll put these plugs in and run another pressure integrity check and see how it works.
Rog.
15, Houston.
Houston, 15. Go.
Roger, Dave. You guys talking about inside plugs or outside plugs?
Inside plugs.
Roger.
Okay, Houston, 15. We've got a good suit circuit now.
Roger. We've been looking at it; copy, agree.
And, 15, we're still looking for an X-ray/Alpha Cover door, Closed. [Pause.]
Okay. Stand by one, Houston.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. The X-ray/Alpha door is Closed.
Copy.
Houston, 15.
Go.
Okay, we're ready to Arm the Logic.
Roger. We're looking.
Okay. Logic 1. [Pause.] Logic 2. [Pause.]
Roger. You're Go for Pyro Arm. [Pause.]
Roger. [Long pause.]
15, LM/CM Delta-P is 2.5 - 2.0, excuse me.
Copy, 2.0.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15.
Go. [Pause.]
Houston, 15.
Roger, 15. Go.
Okay, the LM/CM Delta-P doesn't look exactly right to us. What do you think?
Stand by. [Long pause.]
15, Houston. We'd like to get another pound [per square inch of pressure] out of there. We're showing about 3.5 [psi, 24 kPa] in there.
Okay. We had a suspicion that possibly the LM overhead dump valve was open, and it might be.
We don't think so down here.
Okay. Well, we'll go to Tunnel Vent for a little longer, must just be slow then; we've been in it for probably about 15 minutes.
Copy. [Long pause.]
15, what position are you in when you're reading that out, in Vent or in Delta-P?
Delta-P.
Roger.
It's up to about 2.3 now, and I've been holding it in Tunnel Vent. [Pause.]
15, we'll take that. It'd take too long to get it down, we believe. So let's press on with Jett at that pressure.
Okay, well, the strange thing about it is that we had it up to about - oh 2.7 or 2.8 at one time and then went back to LM/CM Delta-P, and for some reason it [the pressure] built back up in the tunnel. And, I guess the only conclusion we could come to was - from the LM, 'cause the hatch is pretty simple and secure in here. [Long pause.]
Dave, we think that the increase in the cabin pressure during the suit integrity check could have raised it from - from your side.
Well, okay, that's - that's true.
[Stand] by, Dave; confusion reigns down here.
[Thinking out loud] Have you seen any ch - Well, I guess it sort of does up here, too. I wonder if you see any difference in the - you can't read the tunnel, though, can you? [Long pause.]
And, 15; this is Houston. We'd like to verify that you did get a good hatch integrity check back there a ways. [Pause.]
Yes, that's affirm. We got a good hatch integrity check, but - I guess what I'm thinking is there's - you know, there could be something in the seal there. And perhaps the thing to do would be to repressurize the tunnel and pull the hatch down, and take a good close look at the seal and then stick it back in. It shouldn't take too long. [Long pause.]
Apollo 15, Houston. That seems to be about the best conclusion we can come to down here, but we're - [we'd] kind of like to go into a hold briefly. Another indication is that we would - we are seeing the LM cabin holding steady and not using any oxygen from the ascent tanks, which seems to say that we're not leaking into the tunnel from the LM.
Okay, understand.
Do we? [Long pause.]
15, Houston. We'd like to verify that the pressure equalization valve is closed.
That's verified; it's closed and on the yellow stripes.
Roger. [Long pause.]
And, 15, we'd like to back out of your Pyro Arm situation right now. [Pause.]
Okay, Houston; 15. Pyro Arm is Safe, Logic is Off, and the Pyro Arm circuit breakers are pulled.
Copy. [Long pause.]
15, can you give us a LM/CM Delta-P reading at this time, please?
Okay, right now it's 3.0.
Copy, 3.0.
And, I've had the valve in Tunnel Vent for the last 5 minutes or so.
Copy.
Apollo 15, Houston. Recommendation right now is to stop the - the LM Tunnel Vent, and then we will sit and monitor the CM/LM Delta-P for a short while to see what happens to it. And, after that, we're still considering opening up the tunnel to check the seal. Over.
Okay, we're in LM/CM Delta-P right now, and it's reading about 3.1.
Copy, 3.1.
15, we'd like to pull the B/D Roll jets.
Roger. B/D Roll jets coming off. [Long pause.]
And, 15, if one of you has a chance, would you put X-ray to Standby, please? [Pause.]
Rog. X-ray, Standby. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston; it's in Standby.
Thank you.
15, Houston. [Can] you give us a reading now on that? [Pause.]
Okay, Houston; stand by one. [Pause.]
It's just a little under 3.1, just a - just a hairline.
Roger; copy. And we're still looking at the possibility of opening the hatch. We're just trying to - right now, trying to understand the situation before we open the hatch and destroy the configuration we're in.
Okay, we'll stand by.
And, 15; Houston. Could we have another reading in 10 minutes? [Pause.]
Well, it's reading right now just about the same that it was when I last called you.
Roger; copy. There's certainly enough uneasiness down here that we think we ought to proceed back through and open both the Command Module hatch and the LM hatch, check the seals on both and the relief valves on both, proceed back through that, doing - doing those checks, because there could be a very slight leak from the LM that the telemeter guys would not see at - for this small volume in the tunnel. Over.
Rog. We sort of think that's a good idea, too. We'll proceed.
Roger. Keep us posted when convenient.
Roger. Will do. [Long pause.]
15, just in case you haven't got the idea, when I said check the seals, I mean clean them too.
Rog. Understand. We'll make sure they're good and clean.
Okay, Houston; 15. Both hatch seals are clean, and both hatches are now closed and locked. Do you want to vent the tunnel again?
Roger. Go ahead, Dave. Thank you. [Long pause.]
And, 15, are you guys all still fully suited?
Rog. We did not break down the suits; we're still locked up.
Roger. [Pause.]
And the LM overhead dump valve was verified in Auto.
Copy.
Okay, Houston. We're 1.3 [psi] on - Delta-P and coming - coming up.
Copy.
Okay, Houston; we're about 2.2 [psi]. [Pause.]
Copy. [Long pause.]
And, Houston, do you want to go to 3 [psi] and let it stabilize there?
I guess we'll do it per the checklist which is 3.5, right? [Pause.]
Well, not really. Our checklist says before jettison only, LM Tunnel Vent valve, LM Tunnel Vent at least 10 minutes, period. [Pause.]
Okay. Stand by. [Pause.]
'Course, that's after the hatch integrity check. If we want to go ahead and run through the full hatch integrity check, then we'd run up to 3.5 and then run another 10 minutes, I guess.
Yeah, that's the point, Dave. We want to run a complete hatch integrity check; in fact, we'll proba - we may ask you to run it longer than usual.
Okay.
Obviously, what we're thinking about here is a bad hatch seal, so we're particularly interested in that.
Rog. [Long pause.]
And, 15, a reminder. When you're on the back side, the LM is still in 5 degree deadband, so play it cool with the Command Module. [Pause.]
Rog.
And, 15, what we'd like to see you do is leave that tunnel at 3.5 for the entire back side pass, and we'll see what happens to that leak rate. That gives us a nice, long leak check on the hatch. And, we'll be satisfied with that Delta-P for Jett[ison], if that's the way it works out on the other side. [Pause.]
Okay. And, I guess in that case, we'll probably break the suits down and then run another suit check before we see you around the corner. So...
Okay, we'll buy that.
It's about time for dinner.
I knew there was a reason.
Rog. [Pause.] Okay, we're about 3.2 [psi] now on the Delta-P. We'll leave LM [meaning tunnel] in Vent.
Rog. I understand; 3.2 and still venting.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Dave, stand by on taking your suits off; if you haven't taken them off already.
Oh, we hadn't planned to take our suits off; we were just going to break off the helmets and gloves so we could get something to eat.
Roger. But stand by on breaking the suits down; because it's a debate as to whether we want to do another suit integrity check.
Okay.
15, press on. You may - you are permitted to break the suits down, but do not do the suit integrity check until you come back around the other side; we can take another look at that tunnel. Over.
Roger; understand. We'll break them down and hold off until we see you on the other side.
Okay, good luck.
Apollo 15, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 15, Houston. [No answer.]
Apollo 15, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 15, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 15, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
Goddard Voice, Houston Comm tech. Net 1.
Goddard Voice, you're loud and clear.
Roger.
Apollo 15, Houston, Reacq and Narrow. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 15, Houston. Over. [Pause.]
Houston, Apollo 15. Go ahead.
Roger. Do you - Roger. Do you have any good word for us?
I'd say LM/CM Delta-P is off-scale high. [Pause.]
Roger. And how'd the hatch integrity check go? [Long pause.]
Well, we've just had it in tunnel vent all the - the way around the back side as I think you suggested. [Long pause.]
15, did you have a look at holding it in Delta-P to see how the - see how it was holding on there?
No, we just left it in Tunnel Vent all the way around the back side. I - That's what we'd thought you'd said to do. We can check it now. [Long pause.]
15, why don't you bring it up to 3.5, and let us watch it for a while. I think we garbled some - and you watch it. I think we garbled something there.
Okay. Our understanding was to let it go all the way, and then you get a good look out on this side. So we'll bring it up to 3.5.
15, Houston. Two items; one, we want to make sure that you're aware that we cannot read the tunnel pressure, and so we're depending upon your readouts of this Delta-P to give us the confidence here in the hatch integrity. One other item that we do know, is that during all that period when the tunnel was vented, our O2 flow was off-scale low, which does give us some confidence in the integrity of the hatch. And, meanwhile, we're waiting for your call on a 3.5 reading so we can begin a hatch integrity check. Over. [Pause.]
Roger.
Mark. Two minutes and 3.5 plus or minus 0.
Roger. Copy.
And - and I think we have the same confidence, Bob. We noticed the low O2 flow also. The only question we had was, why did the Delta-P change? [Pause.]
That's the same question that was bothering us.
But, it's steady at 3.5, and has been now for about 2 and a half minutes.
Copy. [Long pause.]
Okay, 15. This is Houston. We'd like to run that hatch integrity check to about 5 minutes total, because of what we suspect was the problem before. And, if it passes at that point, we'll press on, per the Flight Plan, for following the normal steps. And you can plan, if we have time for it, we're looking for a jett[ison of the LM] at 179:30, at the present time. Over.
Roger. 179:30, and we'll give you a call at the 5-minute point.
Thank you.
Okay, Houston. There's 5 minutes at 3.5 and it looks solid.
Roger, Dave. Let's press on with a nominal timeline.
Roger. [Long pause.]
And, Houston. Are you happy with 3.5 or would you like to bleed it down a little more?
Roger, Dave. We're happy with the hatch integrity, and let's open the tunnel vent and bleed down towards 4.0 at - for the nominal setup. And I guess it's on the decal there.
Rog. No, the decal says go for 10 minutes in LM tunnel vent.
Roger. And I guess that means after hatch integrity, which means beginning now.
Rog. Step 7, and it's in work.
15, Houston. Your suit integrity check looks good as far as we can tell down here. [Pause.]
Well, we had it for about 5 seconds there, and then the O2 flow went back up, so we'll hang on here and see if it comes back down.
Rog.
Okay, Houston; 15. We got a good pressure integrity check. We're ready to press on.
Roger, we agree. [Long pause.]
And, 15, we're still aiming for 179:30 for Jett[ison]. And be advised, of course, this means we're going to have to retarget P30 to 179:35. And, other than that, all attitudes will be the same. Although, of course, since you'll be local vertical, your inertial attitudes for the burn will be slightly different than what you've seen. [Pause.]
Okay. Understand. And your Delta-P is off-scale high now.
Roger. And you're 14 minutes past that time [that they began venting the tunnel for the last time]. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15.
Go. - Go ahead, 15.
Roger. Understand. The retargeting on P30 - you want to target that for 179 plus 30 plus 00, and the same Delta-Vs as before?
Negative, Al. It's going to be 179 plus 35 plus 00 for the Sep burn.
Sorry about that. I meant 179 plus 35. Three zeros Jett, huh?
That's affirm. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15.
Go. [Pause.] 15, go ahead.
Roger. We're ready to turn the sequence arm on [to re-arm the tunnel pyrotechnics].
Roger. You're Go for turning them on.
Okay, and Logic 1, On; Logic 2, On. [Pause.]
And, 15, you're Go for Pyro Arm.
Roger. [Long pause.]
And, 15, we need Direct RCS, On, please. [Pause.]
Okay. Directs are on. [Long pause.]
And, 15, 3 minutes to Jett[ison], and we're wait - we're watching for Pyro Arm.
Okay. We're proceeding through the pre-Jett checklist at this time, and we'll get right to you.
And, it's away clean, Houston.
Roger, copy. Hope you let her go gently. She was a nice one.
Oh, she was at that.
Houston, 15. Question on the separation maneuver. Do you want us to burn the residuals in P41, or just make 1 foot per second burn?
Roger, Terry. Burn them in P41, please.
Rog.
You understand that's burn the residuals, right?
Just - just making - just making sure. [Long pause.]
Houston, P41 says 7/10ths forward. [Long pause.]
Yes, 7/10ths forward, 7/10ths up.
Roger, Dave.
And forward takes us right back to the LM. [Pause.]
Stand by, Dave. We're looking into that, of course.
Okay. We got about a minute and 15 seconds or so.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Average g is On [i.e. the computer is about to begin the burn and has begun measuring acceleration]. [Long pause.]
Ah, hold the burn, Dave.
Okay, we'll hold the burn.
15, this is Houston. We'd like to have visual reference relative to your position to the LM. We'd like you behind the LM. And, we'll give you a burn attitude for 5 minutes from now. [Pause.]
Roger. [Pause.] Okay, I guess she's 150 feet [45 metres] dead ahead.
Okay. Copy, Dave. Thanks.
And, Dave. Can you verify, were you behind, in local vertical, or body attitude coordinates?
Well, give us a little while to figure that one out.
Roger. Are you behind it in the orbit, or are you just - is it just sitting there in front of you as you sit there and look at it?
It's sitting in front of us when we sit there and look at it.
Bob, we're almost directly radially inward from the LM right now.
Copy that. [Long pause.]
Houston, our attitude is 150 degrees relative to the local horizontal.
Say that again, please, Dave.
Rog. Our attitude, according to Verb 83 down there, is 150 degrees, relative to the local horizontal. Which means we're, I guess, fairly close to local horizontal, at least within 30 degrees. [Long pause.]
Stand by, guys. Confusion still reigns, I think.
Roger. Understand.
15, do you have an ORDEAL ball going at the moment?
Sure do, and it's on the DSKY; you can see it right down there.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Roger, Dave. We would like you to do a VFR burn, which means go - maneuver to a trailing position - and fire one foot per second retrograde. Understand?
That sounds like a good burn. Rog. We'll do that. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15. This ought to make for some interesting discussion, but I guess what you want us to do is point at him and burn aft to one foot per second; is that correct?
Roger, Dave. That's probably the best way to keep an eye on him.
Well, we're having a tough time doing that, because he's right in the Sun right now. [Long pause.]
But, Houston, I think at this attitude, a one foot per second aft will give us sufficient clearance. Don't you? [Pause.]
As long as you're trailing him, Dave. I guess, right now, we can't give you any sound advice down here.
Okay, well, if we burn one foot per second on the local horizontal, which we are almost on right now, I think that will put us in a orbit which re - remains clear of it. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. As far as trailing goes, right now as we look over the ground, we're leading him.
Roger. That's our...
We're about on a horizontal in front of him.
Roger. We need you behind him, Dave. That - we were gradually coming to that conclusion. That was the only way you could have him in the Sun. We need you behind him and then a firing of retrograde. [Pause.]
Yeah, that's going to take an awful lot. Because we're a fair ways out now, and we'll have to maneuver quite a ways to get behind him, and it'll take quite a while and a little bit of gas.
Roger, Dave. Understand that. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Okay, Dave. How about 2 foot per second posigrade, as long as you're in front of him. Understand? 2 foot per second posigrade. [Long pause.]
Okay; so that'll be a minus-X Delta-V for 2 feet per second at out present attitude, right? [Long pause.]
Rog. That affirm, Dave.
Okay. We're all in the same frequency. We'll do that.
Okay, Houston. We put in 2 feet per second aft. And that was done just at local horizontal.
Roger, copy. Thank you. [Long pause.]
And, 15; if you can anticipate, why don't you give me a call when you get yourself partially powered down from this. Then we'll read you some Flight Plan updates, which are mostly just the deletion of activities so you can get to bed.
Okay, Houston. Appreciate that. Thank you, and we'll call you back.
15, Houston. You got a moment for this update?
Just a minute, Bob. [Long pause.]
Okay, Bob. What changes do you have for us.
Okay. These will start out in the Flight Plan here. And, after LM Jett, we'd like you to proceed with the activities that run on the original Flight Plan from 177:30 through 178:01. So that last entry that we will be doing will be the line that says "X-ray, On" at the very top of that next page.
Okay, understand. We'll delete that particular line, "Mapping Camera/Laser Experiment, Off," and we'll do all the activities up to - through 178 there, the Mass Spec. X-ray, On.
Roger. And at the - on that same page, beginning at 178:20 to 178:30, we will scratch that particular - that whole block of items. And going along with that, at 178:39, it says "DAC, On;" we'll also scratch that. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. Understand. We'll scratch the activities from 178:20 to 178:30. And, at 178:39, we'll scratch "DAC, On." How about the activity there at 18:31 [means 178:31]? We - guess we'll do that, huh?
Roger. At 178:31, that "Mass Spec., Multiplier, Low, Discriminator, High: Ion Source, On" will be done 30 minutes - three zero minutes after the Mass Spec. Experiment, On; Ion Source to Standby, which is over there at 178:01. [In] other words, we need a 30-minute delay between the top item on the left-hand column and the top item on the right-hand column.
Okay, we understand.
Okay, we'll delete the Pan Camera activities over on 179 hours. There's one at a hundred [pause] 15, if you read, there's one item at 179:16, and another item at 179:21 that pertain to the Pan Camera. We will delete both of those. [Pause.]
Okay, understand. Delete the Pan Camera action at 179:18 and 179:21.
Roger. Copy. And when your ready to sleep, I guess you can start with the Systems Checklist - pre-sleep checklist at 179:31, there.
Okay, thank you, Bob.
And you'll noticed we didn't delete the eat period. [Pause.]
Thank you.
And - and, Jim; do you guys want a TEI-58 PAD? [Long pause.]
Okay. We'll take one.
Okay. If you got - have you got the [writing] pad out?
No, stand by.
Give me a call.
Okay.
Okay, Jim. Understand you have the [writing] pad. SPS/G&N; 36363; plus 0.61, plus 0.93; 192:13:33.30; plus 2799.7, plus 0609.5, minus 0098.0; 181, 112, 015. Rest of the PAD [is] NA. Ullage: 4 jet, 12 seconds. Over. [Pause.]
Understand. It's a TEI-84 SPS/G&N; 36363; plus 0.61, plus 0.93; 192:13:33.30; plus 2799.7, plus 0609.5, minus 0098.0; 181, 112, 015; 4 jet for 12 seconds.
Roger, Jim. Except it's TEI-58.
Roger. It's 58. [Pause.]
Okay, Jim. And, while we got you, - this is Deke. I'd like to have you and Dave, at least, take a Seconal here before you go to sleep so you can really power down for the night. You guys need it. It's up to Al whether he wants one or not.
Okay, thank you, Deke.
Roger.
15, Houston. We have a correction to that update, if you'd get the Flight Plan back out please.
Okay, go ahead.
Roger. That item 178:30, on the Mass Spec., the discriminator value there should be Low. Copy? [Pause.]
Roger. Understand, Discriminator, Low.
Thank you, Jim.
Apollo 15, Houston. You're about one minute until LOS. Sleep tight.
Right, Deke. Goodnight.
Apollo 15, this is Houston. Standing by in the blind. [No answer.]
Apollo 15, this is Houston. Standing by in the blind. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 15, Houston. Calling in the blind and standing by. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 15, Houston. Calling in the blind. Standing by. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 15, Houston, in the blind. Over. [No answer.]
Apollo 15, Houston, in the blind. Over. [No answer.]
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Okay, we're just about getting bedded down here, Bob. I wanted to check and clarify one thing with you before we did.
Please do.
Okay, the Flight Plan updates that you gave to Jim a little while - earlier included Mass Spec. Experiment, On, and some switching with the discriminator and multiplier. Now, as of yesterday, we had decided not to use the Mass Spec. because of the boom deploy problems. Has somebody decided that we now should deploy the boom?
Rog. My understanding is that we didn't want to do it before the plane change because we might have to jettison it and it's - now that we've got the plane change accomplished, we'll run it. And, if you have to jettison before TEI, we'll do that. Over.
Okay, I understand. I guess I didn't understand that yesterday; and, we'll go ahead and deploy it and get the Mass - Mass Spec. going now.
Roger, Al. And one more thing; we'd like to make sure tonight that Jim is on the EKG for the evening.
That's affirm. Jim will stay on biomed tonight.
Rog. And, one more thing, Al, we would like to verify High Gain Antenna angles as pitch 25, yaw 185.
Right. That's what they're set on now, Bob.
Okay. We had a long while picking you up. I guess we were a little worried, there.
No, we just got our signals crossed in here. And, we had some different numbers on them before. So I got them. We're fixed up now.
Okay, and we'll be expecting you to be in VHF bistatic later on, right? [Pause.]
I guess. Do you want us to go ahead and do that?
Yes, please, Al.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, and one last little check is Optics Power is On. We'd like it Off eventually. I expect you haven't gotten that far yet, Al.
That affirm. We'll get it.
Okay, and otherwise you call us; we won't call you.
Okay, we'll call you. Thank you, Bob. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
15, Houston. Over. [Pause.]
Famous last words; go ahead.
Yeah. How's that for broken promises. Hey, OSO [Orbital Science Officer] just came out of the woodwork and was worried because he doesn't have X-ray and Gamma-rays and all those on yet either. I'd assume you probably have - just haven't done any of that block, right?
Yeah. Hey, Bob, we're still trying to get cleaned up in here and get suits put away and all that sort of stuff. We'll get with it as soon as we can, but it's awfully cramped quarters and an awful lot of stuff to move around.
Rog. We were afraid you'd get used to the luxury of all that space.
I kind of liked it here by myself.
This time I'll keep my promise.
Okay.
Cabin reading about 5.7 over there, Dave?
Okay. I guess we ought to wait until we complete chlorination before we get the...
David.
...the gloves and helmets off.
Hello, Houston; this is 15.
Baseband.
Yes. Of course.
Mine.
Yes, that's yours.
Let me get that.
Hey, pretty good.
Help me put the other end of this guardrail on here.
MDC guard, Al.
So the MDC guard.
Yes.
Hope it doesn't get over [garble].
Is it in the way? Huh?
Oh, the MDC guard.
Did you take that down?
Okay.
Got it?
I got it.
Okay, pal.
Come here and - get this.
What time is it?
32:20.
God, 4 hours; that's...
[Garble].
They say go for it.
Yes, just as well. Just fiddling around and getting squared away.
That's right. I guess all I'm saying is the Flight Plan really ought to reflect that.
Yes, they had you learning the [garble] switch.
Yes.
Okay.
Right there, Jimmy.
Oh, Christ. I'm putting it all over your face here.
Want to use some of your soap?
Hey, you're supposed to be somehow nonaffected by the CMP.
Okay, Dick [sic].
Shit.
Oh, yes, 7 hours left of my 9-hour rest period.
Well, we...
Not interested in what he's doing. You'd like that more than this.
Huh?
Your urine bag? Oh, no, I got them all cleaned out so...
Yes. I've cleaned mine.
Oh! Poor [garble]. I've been - I tell you, I've been rinsing everything out with water every time I pee and every time I go to sleep.
Is that a fact?
Houston, 15. [Pause.]
15, go ahead.
Is it time to get up yet, Bob? [Pause.]
Rog. We've got about 15 updates here for you, if you want to get ready in the SIM bay.
Thought we'd give you a crew status report and the onboard read-outs before we called it a night. I just wanted to check and make sure we got everything turned on for you. [Pause.]
Roger. We'll get the guys looking at that...
We got the Mass Spec. out. Okay, Bob, we got the Mass Spec. out, and I think we've cleaned up everything else for you for tonight, and I'll give you the readings here and then we'll call it a night.
Rog. We're listening, and I hope everybody else down here will be getting with me so we can give it to you at the end, if anybody wants anything. Go ahead. [Pause.]
Okay. The PRDs: 25023, 23174, 08029.
Copy.
My read-outs: Bat C, 37 [volts]; Bat A, 37.5; Bat B, 37.5. RCS quads are 63, 58, 60, 58.
Copy.
And, we are configured for the bistatic radar test. [Pause.]
Al, that should be bistatic VHF.
That's correct, Bob. The bistatic VHF radar test. [Pause.]
And, can you think of anything else that needs to be done?
Stand by, Al.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, three verifies for you, Al. Can you verify the Gamma-ray's out? The X-ray is ready? And we need a verify on Jim for his EKG.
Okay. He's not hooked up yet but he will be shortly. And we'll verify the Gamma-ray, out and On, and the X-ray, On.
Thank you. [Pause.]
And, Al, we're working a state vector uplink for you. Stand by a minute and we'll get a decision on that.
Okay, Rob. I guess we didn't have a[n indication of the] Gamma-ray [boom going] out, so it's going out now.
Roger. That's a verify, I guess.
And the X-ray is On.
Thank you. [Pause.]
Okay, the X-ray is On. Seems like we had quite a few loose ends tonight. [Long pause.]
And, Al, how about a verify on X-ray Covers, Open? [Long pause.]
Roger. That's verified. It's Open.
Thank you. We're still discussing the vector here.
Okay.
If you can give us P00 and Accept, we'll have a load in about a minute. Stand by, just Accept...
Okay.
...sorry.
Do you want P00?
Negative. Accept only.
Okay. I'll leave it P20.
Swinging.
Okay, and 15, you can have Block back again. Good show. Thanks for the patience this evening, and Karl will wake you when he wakes you and not a moment before. Goodnight.
Okay, that sounds like a winner, Bob. Good night.
Apollo 15, Houston. [Pause.]
Houston, 15. Go ahead.
Rog. This isn't Karl waking you up; but we don't show the Mass Spec. Experiment to On, and if the out - outgassing has been completed, we need the Ion Source, On. Over.
Okay. We've got it On, and it's been on for about 45 minutes now. And we now have Multiplier, Low, and Discriminator, Low.
Beautiful, Al.
Stand by on that, Bob, stand by.
Standing by. [Long pause.]
Okay, Bob, we got it now.
Understand you got Experiment, On, now...
Checking [garble], it should be On now.
Copy. Thank you.
Right.
We'll try again.
