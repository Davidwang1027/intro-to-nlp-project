15, Houston. 1 minute to T-horizon.
Rog, Ed.
Houston, Apollo 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Okay; looks like FAO owes us one. I had no trouble picking up Index Crater at all. The surface looks generally smooth. I saw no big boulders. I saw more craters than we're normally used to seeing, but I think that's because of the resolution of the photography. I can see a - a fair amount of boulders in the bottom of the rille. Most of the surface seems to be pretty subdued and rounded. I did see some debris around some of the fresher craters. And, of course, I don't know exactly what size, but if we're looking at 3-feet resolution on this, I'd - I'd say I didn't see anything larger than - I guess, at the most, maybe 15 feet or so, but that's - that was a unique rock. The - the area, in general, looks pretty good. I don't think we'll have any problem picking it up, and I don't think Al will have any problem at all identifying Index Crater.
Okay, Dave. We copy. Thanks a lot.
Rog.
Apollo 15, Houston. If there's someone available to copy a TEI-19 PAD, I'll give it to you.
Okay; hold for about 5, will you please, Ed?
Will do.
Okay, Houston; go - go ahead with the TEI PAD.
Roger, 15. TEI-19: SPS/G&N 38009; plus 0.61, plus 1.05; 115:27:55.59; plus 2845.1, minus 0831.7, minus 0219.7; 180, 102, 346. The rest, NA. Ullage, 4 jet, 12 seconds; and some notes. One is, burn is undocked; two, assume Circ.; three, longitude at TIG is 166.0 west; and the fourth note is, the attitude's based on landing-site REFSMMAT.
Okay, readback. TEI-19: SPS/G&N; 38009; plus 0.61, plus 1.05; 115:27:55.59; plus 2845.1, minus 0831.7, minus 0219.7; 180, 102, 346; 4 jet, 12 seconds; burn undocked; assume Circ.; longitude 166.0 west at TIG, and landing site REFSMMAT.
That's affirm; and we have a few centiseconds update for your CMC clock, whenever you're ready.
Okay, you want P00 and Accept?
That's affirm.
You got it.
computer's yours, 15.
Falcon - rather, Apollo 15, Houston. Omni Charlie, please.
Houston, 15. Go ahead.
Omni Charlie, please, Al.
Okay, Omni Charlie.
Haven't had a chance to say good morning, Al, so good morning.
Good morning, Edgar.
Apollo 15, Houston.
Houston, 15. Go ahead.
Rog. We need to redo the REFSMMAT update that we gave you a little while ago. Could we have P00 and Accept please?
Okay, Ed. You caught me just in time, doing a P52.
Rog...
I'll go back to P00.
what - what we were hoping to do.
Okay; you got it now.
Roger. Here it comes.
The story here, Al, is that, apparently, the block update changed some registers in the REFS - REFSMMAT and screwed it up a bit.
Rog.
15, Houston. The computer's yours. And, Al, before you do 50 52, be advised you can use the Systems Test Meter on the backside for any of the normal LM checkout functions; on the front-side, we'll watch it for you. And go ahead and leave the test meter in whatever position you're - you're testing with. You understand?
Rog, Ed. Understand.
Okay; proceed with your P52.
Okay; thank you.
Apollo 15, Houston. Thirty seconds to LOS.
Rog, Ed.
In case you guys are wondering, I'm dumping.
Fuel cell purge, huh? Okay, fuel cell purge. Two for 2 hours. Two of them on.
Hey, we're going to maneuver.
Yes, must be low.
Well, we're getting there. Slowly.
What?
We're getting there slowly.
Yes. I think so.
When you almost get there, how about?
Okay.
All right.
coming up to AOS up to - be ready for AOS.
I think I'm just about ready.
Yes. Where is the tape? Anybody know?
It's over -.
Okay.
Oh, what the hell.
Hey, Al.
Yes.
What?
What?
Did you?
No. You guys are too far ahead.
Okay. Let's see.
Ready?
You want P - Okay.
Okay.
Okay there, Endeavour. How do you read the Falcon on...
Hey, loud and clear.
Say again?
Beautiful!
Good.
And, Al, how do you read me?
Read you loud and clear, Jim.
Ah, you're beautiful.
Hey, did you say something about TEPHEM? Did you want a TEPHEM, Dave?.
stand by.
Okay. I'll give it to you if you want.
Stand by. Configure for Simplex A.
Okay.
Okay, Al. How do you read on A?
Loud and clear, Dave.
That's nice.
And, Al, how do you read me?
Loud and clear, Jim.
Very good.
Okay. Now you can give me your TEPHEM.
Okay.
Ready to copy?
Go.
Just like SIM. All balls in the R1. R2 is 32251. R3 is 26157.
Okay. All balls, 32251, 26157.
Great.
Want a clock sync?
Stand by 1.
Okay, Al. Verb 06 - 6 - Verb 06 Noun 65; I'll give you a mark.
Give me a mark. I'm waiting.
3, 2, 1, Mark.
Okay. 98:25:45.60.
Okay. 25:45.60.
Roger.
Apollo 15, Houston; standing by.
And I'm coming up to get the umbilical now.
Read you loud and clear.
Roger, Houston. This is Falcon. Read you loud and clear.
Okay, Falcon; reading you. We have a lot of noise on the loop - maybe it'll go away in a moment.
Okay. Let's hope so.
Okay, Endeavour, Another Noun 65 if you're ready.
On your mark.
3, 2, 1...
Mark.
Okay. 98:26:59.60.
Okay. We're within three hundredths.
Okay.
Endeavour, Houston. Do you read?
Hello, Endeavour, Houston, this is Endeavour. Loud and clear.
Okay, Al. We read you through the static. Let us have Narrow on the High Gain, please.
Okay, you've got it. Narrow and Reacq.
And, Houston, this is Falcon. We're going to configure for secondary S-band transmitter and receiver.
Okay, Falcon. Press on with secondary S-band.
Roger.
Houston, this is Falcon. How do you read?
Endeavour, Houston. Verify on your last P52, you used option 1.
Houston, Endeavour. Go ahead.
Roger, Al. Verify that on your last P52, you used option 1.
I think that's a negative, Ed. I used option 3. Stand by one and I'll check.
Roger. We're standing by.
Houston, how do you read Falcon?
Falcon, Houston. You're coming through; we have a lot of static on the line and they're trying to clear it up now. You're way down in the mud.
Okay. I can give you my time with that - time - 97:54:55.
Houston, Endeavour.
Go ahead, Endeavour.
Okay, Ed. I did do that on an option 3.
Okay. We'll have some words for you, and we're ready to uplink to you, Endeavour, if you'll give us - P00 and Accept.
Okay, you got P00 and Accept.
Falcon, Houston. Your S-band check is okay. You can press on, and I'll have your updates for you in a little while.
Roger.
And, Apollo 15; Houston. I'm going to hold off reading you any PADs at the moment until we can clear up our comm on the ground.
Roger.
Falcon, Houston. Bring up your steerable, please. See if that helps our comm.
In work.
Houston, this is Falcon. We're locked up on the - the High Gain. How do you read?
Okay, Jim. Reading you loud and clear now; that has seemed to improved our comm. And I'm - I'm ready to start with the PADs. I'll start with the CSM first, Al - whenever you're ready.
Okay; he's working right now. Are you ready for an E-memory dump on the Falcon?
Stand by.
Falcon, Houston. We're ready for the E-Mod dump.
Okay; Stand by.
En - Endeavour, Houston. The computer's yours.
Rog, Houston.
And, Endeavour; Houston. We will stay with the REFSMMAT you have.
Okay, Ed. Thank you.
Falcon, Houston. Give us P00 and Data. I have an uplink for you.
Roger, P00 and Data.
And I'm ready to give PADs, Falcon, whenever you want them.
Okay, Al; I'm checking it.
Go ahead, Ed.
All right, your LM DAP data first. CSM weight, 37679; LM weight, 36630. Your GDA drive angles onboard are good.
Okay; copy. CSM weight is 37679; LM weight, 36630.
That's affirm. AGS abort constants. 224...
Go ahead.
plus 60442; 225, plus 29365; 226, plus 60449; 305, minus 01659; 662, minus 55021; 673, minus 32306.
Okay; readback on the AGS abort constants. 60442, 29365, 60449, 01659, 55021 and 32306.
Affirm. The first 3 are plus, the last three are negative.
That's affirm. Houston, Falcon.
Go ahead, Falcon.
Okay. Everything is in order up to this point as far as the checkout goes, with the exception of the - LGC. When we pushed in the LGC circuit breaker, we got a program light - with a 400 and R1. A Verb 5 Noun 9 gave us an 1105, which seems to be of little consequence; just thought you might like to know.
We copy, Dave.
Falcon, Houston. The computer's yours.
Roger.
And, Endeavour; Houston. Are you about ready for your PADs?
Rog, Ed. Stand by one.
Okay, Houston. Endeavour's ready to copy.
Okay. Falcon, the first one's a SEP time, if you would like that one, too.
Houston, Falcon. Go ahead; we'll stand by.
Okay. SEP: GET 100:13:56.00 - the pitch angle of 108.
Understand, Ed. That's GET of 100:13:56.00. And that's a pitch angle of 108.
That's affirm, Al. Okay, the next one is CSM DAP data.
Okay; go.
Roger. CSM weight, 37679; pitch, 0.49; yaw, 1.04.
Understand. The DAP data is weight, 37679; pitch trim is 0.49; and yaw trim is 1.04. And do you have some signs on those?
It's a good readback, and say again your last?
Roger, Ed. I need a sign on the pitch and yaw trims.
All right - Let me check that.
Okay.
It's affirm, Al, they're both positive.
Understand; they're both plus.
Okay; your P24 is next.
Okay; go ahead.
T-1, 100:46:29; T-2, 47:07; TCA, 47:37; T-3, 47:59; roll, pitch, and yaw are 008, 296, 000; north, 3 nautical miles. Noun 89, longitude-over-2, plus 2.149. Latitude and altitude are nominal.
Roger, Ed - Ed - Understand. P24 landmark tracking PAD: T-1 at 100:46:29; T-2, 47:07; TCA, 47:37; T-3, 47:59. It's a roll of 008; pitch, 296; yaw, 000. Expected north at 3 nautical miles. And understand the longitude-over-2 is plus 02.149, and latitude and altitude are as in the Flight Plan.
Good readback, Al.
And, Houston, this is Falcon. ED batteries both reading 37 volts.
We copy that, Falcon; thank you.
Okay, Endeavour; Falcon. We're ready for a Docked IMU Coarse Align, if you are.
Okay, Falcon. Stand by one.
Okay; give us a call when you are in Min Deadband, Attitude hold.
Rog.
Okay, Dave; we're there.
Okay; if you read us your gimbal angles, please.
Okay; R1 is plus 001.24, R2 is plus 101.66, R3 is plus 005.37.
Plus 001.24, 101.66, 005.37.
Rog.
Falcon...
Houston, Falcon. We got about 9 minutes 'til sunset here.
Okay, Dave. And we have a clock update for you of about 66 centiseconds if you'll give us P00 and Data, please.
Okay; P00 and Data. You got it.
And, Houston; Falcon. We'd like to do the RCS pressurization now since we're a tad ahead, if - you're ready to take that?
Okay; we're ready, Falcon; go ahead.
Okay.
And, Endeavour, Houston. When you get a moment, we'll take your read-outs from the last P52.
Okay, Ed.
Falcon, the computer's yours.
Roger.
Houston, Falcon. A slight pause here while we look at the landing site; we're going right over it.
Ah. Roger.
Okay; a few interesting differences there. Index is much more subtle than we've seen on the simulator. And Earthlight is much sharper with a much deeper shadow.
Copy, Dave.
Houston, Endeavour. Here are the P52 numbers.
Say again, Endeavour.
Roger; I got the P52 numbers for you.
Ready to copy, Al.
Okay, Ed. Stars 41 and 42; Noun 05 was plus four balls 1. Gyro torquing angles were minus 00.010, minus 00.009, minus 00.025. And they were torqued out at 97:39 even.
Copied that, Al. And could you give us your LM power switchover time, please?
Roger. That was at 97:35.
We copy that. And what was the result of the VHF check; does it work okay?
That was satisfactory both ways - far as I know.
Thank you.
Rog, Houston. It was good both ways.
Hey, Endeavour; Falcon. Did you copy that on the difference between Earthlight and Index.
Rog.
Okay.
And, Houston. The RCS looks good up here on the Falcon.
And it looks good down here, Dave.
Okay. We'll pick up the alignment now and get back to you later on with the RCS checkout.
Okay.
Houston, Falcon. That P57 up here, docked, works pretty well.
Houston, Falcon, do you have the torquing angles?
That's affirmative.
Okay; we'll torque them at 11:30.
Roger. Observe the five balls there.
Yeah; a couple of interesting things, we have reflection off the Command Module apparently from Earthlight. And it's sort of tough to track the star with the Command Module deadbanding, but seems like if you get the star in the crosshairs, why, the optics take care of it for you.
Copy.
And, Falcon; Houston. Will you - you verify the roll CAL for us, please?
Roger. Minus.1.
Copy, Dave.
Okay, Endeavour; Falcon. Mid - min deadband no longer required.
Okay.
Okay, Houston; Falcon. We're ready for the RCS checkout, if you are.
We're ready to go, Falcon.
Roger.
Okay, Houston; Falcon. Do you have your High Bit Rate?
That's affirm, Dave.
Okay. And, Endeavour. We need you in a wide deadband Attitude Hold.
Okay; wide deadband Attitude Hold.
Roger.
Endeavour, Falcon. Do you have any jet fires going on over there?
I haven't detected any, Dave.
Okay.
You want me to go Free now?
Rog. Go Free, please.
Okay, Endeavour. We'll be firing the direct coils.
Okay.
Okay, Endeavour. Hot fire check is complete. Everything looks good. You can go back to wide deadband Attitude Hold.
Okay. And I'm going to turn the roll jets off and put the hatch in, if you don't mind.
Oh, good.
And, Falcon; Houston.
And, Houston, Falcon. How did it look down there?
I was just going to tell you, Dave, hot fire check looked good here.
Okay. They're nice and positive, aren't they?
That's affirm.
Endeavour, Falcon. Could you verify RCS thruster, B-3, Off, and the Transponder, Off, please?
I'll verify both those.
Thank you.
And, Falcon; Endeavour. I'm cocking the latches now.
Okay.
