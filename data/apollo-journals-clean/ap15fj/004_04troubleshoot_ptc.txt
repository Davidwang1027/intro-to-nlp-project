Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
When you get a free moment, we have a reasonably short procedure in align with checking out the SPS Thrust light. Over.
Okay. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Go ahead, Gordo. Ready to copy.
Okay. We see you're starting the P52 [platform realignment program]. This shouldn't interfere, but it - We can wait if you wish.
I was just going to copy the procedure, and we'll do it later.
Okay. It's - it's the kind of thing we have to watch on the ground as you do it, so it's probably not even worth writing down.
Okay. Let's wait then until after [the] P52 [is finished].
All right.
Houston, 15.
Go ahead.
Okay, Gordo. If you're reading, I've got the gyro torquing angles up [on the DSKY display] and I'll torque them out at 5:30.
Okay; we're reading the DSKY [via telemetry]. Understand [you will torque the platform around to the correct alignment at] 5:30.
Apollo 15, Houston. Standing by with a lift-off plus 15 abort PAD.
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Okay, Gordo. I'm standing by for the PAD.
Okay. It's GET of ignition [is a time] of 015:00. Delta-VT, 4926; minus 175; 051:20. Go ahead.
Stand by. [Long pause.]
All right, Gordo, give me that - it's a P37 PAD that you have there?
That's right, Jim. I should have used that terminology.
Go ahead.
Okay; 015:00, time of ignition; 4926; longitude is minus 175, and GET for 400K is 051:20. Over.
I copied, 015:00, 4926, minus 175, 051:20.
That's correct, Jim. [Long pause.]
Go ahead. [Long pause.]
15, Houston. When you - when ya'll get a chance, we'd like to go with this SPS Thrust light check.
Okay, Gordo. I'm over in the left couch now; let's go ahead and try it.
Okay. Stand by; I'll get everybody watching [their consoles, in Mission Control]. Okay. First of all, I'd like to be sure that both the Pilot Valve circuit breakers on panel 8 [to the far left of the Main Display Console] and both Delta-V Thrust switches are Off - both circuit breakers.
Okay, Houston. Both Pilot Valves [circuit breakers] are Open, and the Delta-V Thrust switches are Off.
Okay. Now when we do the following steps, we'd like you to watch the SPS Thrust light, and watch it for changes either going out or changes in intensity. We're trying to determine if it's a high resistance or a low resistance short; and if it gets brighter, that'll tell us something about this short with any one of these actions.
Okay.
Okay. First item is: put the thrust hand controller clockwise, and watch the light.
Ah, Gordo. Do you mean the THC, the translation hand controller?
Rog. That's what I meant. THC, clockwise.
Okay. We'll go clockwise with it. We're clockwise, and no change.
Okay. Put the THC back to neutral.
Rog. [Pause.]
Okay. SPS Thrust switch, Direct On.
Okay. SPS Thrust, Direct On.
And any change in the light?
I didn't see any change. And it's Off.
Okay. Back to Normal.
Rog. Back to Normal.
Okay. We'd like you to do the first part of an EMS Delta-V check - from page G2-5 and just the first steps - down to the - you don't have to do the bias check, but the first six steps there.
Right. [Pause.]
[The] idea here is to check for a possible short in the Delta-V test circuits. It might be causing the light [to come] on. [Long pause.]
Okay, Gordo. That part of the check's been run and it's shut off at a minus 21.4 in ten seconds, and the SPS light - the SPS Thrust light got distinctly brighter during the decelerat... or during the acceleration period.
Roger, Al, copy. And I'll see if there is anything else they [the engineers in Mission Control] want to do here.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, Al. I guess no more questions right now. We'll mull that over a little bit.
Okay, Gordo.
Apollo 15, Houston.
Houston, 15.
I've got a short update for your erasable load update as contained in the back of the G&C Checklist. Three num - three addresses to update. Over.
Okay; go ahead.
Turn to page G9-4.
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Okay, Gordo; go ahead. I've got the G&C Checklist out now.
Okay; on that 9-4, the first one is changing NBD-X, the static drift compensation for the X-gyro. Under load Alpha, the octal ID number 11, which now reads 77332, change that to 00377. Over.
Understand. That's Alpha octal ID 11, where it now says 77332, change that to read 00377.
That's affirmative. And on load Bravo, IDs four and five are changed. This changes Tephem[erides] to correspond with actual lift-off. And load 4, which is now 30560, change that to 32251. And while you're still writing, change the next one, load - or ID number 5, from 10000 to 26157.
Roger; understand. That's column Bravo, IDs 4 and 5, change 4 to 32251, and 5 to 26157.
That's correct. That's - that takes care of it, Al.
Okay.
15, Houston. Over.
Houston, 15. Go.
If you're not using the optics, we suggest you zero them; they're - we noticed them drifting.
Okay; thank you. [Long pause.]
We've been taking turns looking at the Earth through the telescope. It's a fantastic sight.
Rog, Dave. [Long pause.]
As a matter of fact, this sure would be a neat place for a space station out here.
Roger.
Apollo 15, this is Houston.
Hello, Houston, Apollo 15. Go.
Hey, the results that we got out of that last test procedure - didn't solve many problems for us. I guess the best we found out was that we don't have a simple problem like a stuck EMS relay. And there's a lot of thinking going on down here, and at the present time, we line up three - three possibilities, depending on where the [electrical] ground is in the system. And the first one is that it's still a ground that simply turns on the light and affects nothing else. Second possibility, that it's a ground that's going to light the engine early when you put on the Delta-V Thrust switches. And there's a third possibility, that the - the ground is upstream of the pilot valves, and that we'll bro - we'll blow the Pilot Valve circuit breakers and lose that bank, if - if we're unlucky. We're busy down here working on a procedure that we could use at Midcourse Correction 1 to decide which - which of these three possibilities is the right one. And we're talking about getting this all worked out and sent up to you in about 2 hours.
Okay; understand. Good luck.
Righto.
Houston, this is 15.
15, this is Houston.
You have down [in the Flight Plan] a null bias check [of the EMS]. Delta-V with .9.
Roger. We read Delta-V .9.
15, this is Houston.
Houston, 15.
We're seeing a low O2 repress package pressure down here. Okay; we'll take that back. We have a suspicion that we have a low O2 repress package, and I would like to have an onboard readout of your pressure there.
Okay. [Pause.]
Houston, it is a little low. We just never finished filling it after we pressurized the tunnel.
Rog. [Pause.]
They say they'd like to go to Fill now and get it filled up.
Rog. We'll do that.
Apollo 15, this is Houston.
Houston, 15. Go.
Hey, would you ask Al to give us about 3 seconds on the Noun 49, so we can read them out down here.
Oh, very well.
15, this is Houston with an update for your procedures for UV photos.
[Faint] Stand by one.
And, Houston, that last Noun 49 looked like 60 and 16.
[Acknowledging Jim's Noun 49] We copy.
Houston, this is 15. Ready on that update concerning the UV photos.
Roger. On page 3-15 in the Flight Plan, in the left column, about the 17th line down, we have 2 frames with filter number 2.
I found that line.
Roger. And instead of 2 frames at 20 seconds, we would like one frame at 20 seconds; and we would like a second frame at 2 seconds. [Pause.]
Roger. I copy one at 20 seconds and one at 2 seconds.
Roger. The reason for that is that they have recently measured a secondary light leak in that filter, and they need a - two different exposures like this to really separate the two peaks in the filter transmissitivity. [Pause.] Incidentally, this is going to pertain to all the UV photography of the Earth on down the line, but we'll - we'll update it as we come to them. [Long pause.]
And, 15. We have a preliminary procedure about to come up to you to see if we can isolate whether this ground in the SPS system is in bank A or bank B. And that'll be coming up in just a few minutes. We...
Okay. I understand.
And we would like to do that before we start the UV photography.
Very well.
15, this is Houston. I have the preliminary procedure I spoke about and we're hoping you might be able to do it while Al works with the P23.
Okay; go ahead.
You might refer, if you want to see what's going on, to Drawing 8.9 down in area E-3. We're playing with the - Delta-V Thrust switch, and the idea is this: First of all, let's open the - the Group 5 circuit breakers on panel 229, both Main A and Main B. That's a back-up to the SPS Pilot Valves on Panel 8, which we also want open. Verify that.
Okay. Group 5, Main A and Main B on 229. Stand by.
Okay, both those are open.
Roger. We've verified Group 5, both open; and the SPS Pilot Valves both open. Then, we'd like to take the Delta-V Thrust A switch and try to balance it right in a center position. Tease it back and forth a little bit to see if you can get any flickering in the SPS Thrust - Thrust On light.
Okay. Stand by.
Ah, Jim, let's - let's hold up a little bit before we do that. We don't - We're not all set up down here to watch that also. So let's - let me read on through the procedure.
Okeydoke.
If the light does flicker, of course, that's going to isolate, in this case, if we were playing with - with the Delta-V Thrust A switch, that'll isolate the problem into the - to the A bank of valves. If we don't see any flicker, then we'll go ahead and try it with the B - well, with the B bank. Actually, we would like to go ahead and do it with the B bank also. So, stand by a moment.
Okay, understand. Standing by. [Pause.]
Eight - 8.9-E3.
We'd like to have a [setting of the] High Gain [antenna], [to] Medium [beamwidth].
High Gain, Medium.
[Garble].
No. No. It's not under EMS.
[Garble].
What?
[Garble].
No, we're not. We're talking about Group 5, on 229.
[Garble].
No, he's also - he's talking about pilot valves.
Oh, he is? [Garble] circuit breakers [garble]. That light.
Huh! EPS Group 3. He said Group 5.
He said Group 5?
Group 5. It's Group 3 here. That's not what he's working on. He's working on the Delta-V thrust. 8.9-E3.
229, GROUP 3.
Huh!
15, this is Houston. We're ready to go ahead. Verify again the Group 5 breakers and the SPS Pilot Valve breakers, and then let's tease that Delta-V Thrust A switch. Try to balance it in a central position.
Okay. Will do. We - we note that drawing 8.9 Echo 3 doesn't seem to fit what you're doing. [Long pause.]
Actually, it's area Echo 3 and 4, and it simply shows you the Delta-V Thrust switches there.
Oh, okay. Okay.
Shoot!
The light has a contact, whether that switch is On or Off and we would like to balance it half way between so that we don't have a contact.
Okay. Here goes Delta-V [switch] A now. [Pause.] Okay, A is up and on, and the SPS Thrust light is off. [Long pause.]
It is? Gee! Good grief!
Would you confirm that the Delta-V Thrust A switch is up and the light went out. Is that correct?
That's correct. It's still in the up and On position, and when I went to the On position, the light went out.
Thank you.
I'll just leave it there while you think about it.
Thank you. That's - stand by.
Wonder why it'll do that?
[Snicker.] I can only think of one reason - that it's really in backwards. Did you cycle those switches [garble], Jim?
Aah...
Yes, you did - pulled the circuit breakers out to see if the light would change any.
Yes.
I think I would've, too. But he...
[Garble] contact [garble] that contact - [laughter]. That's amazing. No. In either position, though, the light should come on.
15, this is Houston. We'd like to feel our way ahead here, and we'd like to have you put Delta-V Thrust A back to Off.
A is Off, and the light remains off.
Momentary.
We copy. [Long pause.]
Huh! Is the light still off?
It's a switch problem. Yes, the light's still off. I bet it was a - when we did that Sep, bet we got a little solder ball in that switch or something.
Bet we did, too.
15, this is Houston. Our telemetry confirms both of your observations, and we would now like to have you cycle [switch] Bravo.
Roger. [Pause.] Bravo is up and On; the light is off. [Pause.] Now Bravo is Off and the light remains off.
We copy. [Long pause.]
Change out the switch.
Huh?
All we got to do is change out that switch.
Yes. All we got to do is bring that bank on late, and turn it off early.
Yes, unless you get a contact in there, we wouldn't have the ignition signal, though.
15, we'll sit tight and think about that for a while, thank you.
[Snicker.]
Rog.
The good thing about it, though, is that apparently the SPS Thrust light - Thrust light works okay.
Yes.
And that's - your cue. You know, all you need, I guess, is the ignition signal - when the light's on.
Yes. Right now [garble] give guidance the ignition signal.
Aaah - Whooo! [Garble].
I think you're about checked out.
I'll do one more.
O2 Flow.
Whoo. [Garble] much of that crap.
You feel pretty good about those?
Yes.
Good.
He's doing all that.
You better believe it!
You want that optics calibration, don't you?
Uh-huh. What's the attitude?
Okay, the attitude is - well, wait until you get to P00 and you can do a little work on it.
Okay, now, the attitude of Verb 49 to - it's 210, 339, 330. Okay. Going CMC, Auto.
Okay.
A long way to go. 142 [garble] up to [garble] start the UVs. [Garble].
Yes, we've got several of those.
[Garble].
You ready for the UV stuff there, Dave? Well, I'm not quite through (yawn) with my stuff though. [Garble].
So you have black on one side and white on the other.
Yes, [garble].
15, this is Houston. As a final check as to what's happening in that switch, we'd like to have you tap around the Delta-V Thrust switches a bit. See if any light flickering comes on.
Roger. In work. [Pause.]
Good. It just came on.
Would you believe? It came on.
We copy, and we saw it down here. [Pause.] Okay. With the light on now, let's cycle Bravo on and try to tease it in the middle if it stays on.
That's good.
Okay. Cycling Bravo. [Long pause.]
Okay. No change at all with the Bravo on, cycling several times through the middle.
We copy. [Pause.] Okay. Leave Bravo Off, and let's cycle A again.
Roger. [Pause.]
Okay. Right in the center of - the contacts with A, right between the two, I can get the light to go out. But now, when I go on up - up and On, the light comes on again. And now, I've come back to the Off position, and the light's off. So, I think you've isolated your problem.
Roger.
Think so, too. That just says we're going to have to use - ban - bank B this time.
It says you're going to have to pull the circuit breakers on A.
Yes.
Before the shutdown.
Yes. Well, either that or - yes, that's right, see.
Because if it doesn't, there's no guarantee the switch is going to do you any good.
That's right. Okay, we got an ap - optics calibration here? What - what star is it?
We're at that attitude now.
Oh, okay. That's - star number 1.
Star number 1 again, huh? Okay.
Okay; we should be looking right at it.
Why do we get...
I don't - I don't know why I get an ignition. We got the light on, but that doesn't say we have an ig - ignition signal. Threw that switch. How could that switch affect the ignition signal unless it was there from someplace else?
Yes. Hey, that's right.
The switch can't produce an ignition signal without something else producing the ignition signal. It sounds to me like the light circuit breaker switch.
Yes.
You know they took the FCSM out.
I know it.
[Garble] they really got a complicated system.
15, this is Houston. We're willing to stop playing with the - with the light problem at the present time. We'd like to verify that both Delta-V Thrust switches are Off. And we'd like to have the Group 5 circuit breakers both Closed, but please keep the Pilot Valve circuit breakers Open.
Okay. Delta-V Thrust verified Off. Pilot Valves verified Open, and we'll Close the Group 5s.
Okay. We're done - 20C.
Thank you.
Okay, let's go to UV then. Jim, watch the Itek.
Omni Delta, please.
Rog. Omni Delta. [Long pause.]
15, this is Houston.
Houston, 15.
Let's - summarize our situation with that - with that Thrust - Thrust On light. The telemetry we got down here - we actually have two lights which show up in that area, E-4 and 5 on diagram 8.9 - gave us some rather confusing data that we don't understand yet, but we'll be working on it. But we - we do feel confident enough that there's no need to fire the engine at the present time, and since the midcourse [correction number] 1 is a correction of 2.8 feet per second we don't think that we'll be having a midcourse 1. For your information, at the present time, midcourse 2 looks about like 5.0 feet per second.
Okay; understand. We'll just hold tight; skip midcourse 1; stand by for [midcourse correction] 2.
Roger. [Pause.] And, 15, be advised we'll have a Flight Plan update in the near future.
Roger. [Pause.] That was a pretty good S-IVB, wasn't it?
Roger. [Long pause.]
Hey, and you can tell Al up there that those look like real good P23 markings.
Okay. He's glad to hear that.
Very good, Karl.
15, if you'll give us Accept, we'll send up a new state vector.
Say again 15.
Okay. You have P00 and Accept.
15, you can have your computer back. [Pause.]
Roger.
We would like to have Omni Bravo, please.
Houston, [Apollo] 15.
15, This is Houston.
Rog, Karl. Would you go back and recheck the attitude - the attitude for the UV pictures of the Moon?
Stand by. We'll check that. The numbers you have in the DSKY are what we have in the Flight Plan. [Pause.]
Houston, 15. As you were on that. Looks like we are all set up.
Roger.
15, this is Houston. Could we bring up the High Gain [Antenna] with the angles in the Flight Plan?
Roger, Houston. Stand by.
What are the angles in the Flight Plan? Isn't that where we're supposed to do this?
Says "Omni D, High Gain, minus 33 and 213."
Check out 1, 2. Minus 33 and 214. 211 is what the DSKY says. Close enough.
That's real.
Yes, [garble]. Ooooh.
There, David.
All I got to say, Al, is good luck.
Good luck with what?
15, This is Houston. I have a Flight Plan update whenever you can copy it - to be followed by a P27 update and P37 block data.
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Okay, Karl. I'm [garble] you a Flight Plan.
Okay. As is obvious [because of the cancelled midcourse correction maneuver], you can delete all of the midcourse activities, beginning there at 11:21, running through the burn status report. And the other activities this evening can be moved up so that you can go to bed as early as 12 hours GET, if you wish. A couple of notes here is that we do want you to stay up to 12 hours in order that we can finish a battery charge that's in progress. And, also, that waste water dump; be sure to - to do the water dump before you start PTC [Passive Thermal Control].
Okay. We understand that.
And, I'm - I've got a P37 for you - plus 25 hours, if you're ready.
Stand by one. [Long pause.]
I'm ready for the P37 for 25 hours.
Roger. 025:00, 4621, minus 175, 075:21; 035:00, 6821, minus 174, 074:51; 045:00, 5605, minus 175, 099:06; 060:00, 5448, minus 175, 123:06 and that's the end. [Pause.]
Readback. 025:00, 4621, minus 175, 075:21; 035:00, 6821, minus 174, 074:51; 045:00, 5605, minus 175, 099:06; 060:00, 5448, minus 175, 123:06.
That's all correct. The next one I have is a P27 update.
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Okay; I'm ready on the P27.
Roger. It's - the purpose, V71; GET 11:45:00; INDEX 21, 01501, 00001, 71465, 41437, 76654, 45425, 77003, 52553, 72602, 54007, 75455, 55217, 76267, 55324, 00402, 05560, and that's all.
Okay. On the P27s; 71, 11:45:00; 21, 01501, 00001, 71465, 41437, 76654, 45425, 77003, 52553, 72602, 54007, 75455, 55217, 76267, 55324, 00402, and 05560.
That's all correct. Thank you, Jim.
Houston - Houston, 15.
15, this is Houston.
Roger, Karl. We've got the gyro torquing angles up for the P52. And we'll torque them out on the minute.
Roger. We've copied them. [Long pause.]
And, Houston, this is 15 now. Looking at the Oxidizer Pressure on the SPS, looks like it's a little low; I just wondered what you all are reading down there? [Long pause.]
15, this is Houston. We're reading a pressure of 168 [psi] down here on the SPS Oxidizer and that's normal at this time. We expect it to be a bit low because of absorption in the helium.
Okay; thank you. [Long pause.]
And, 15, this is Houston. When you doff your biomed harnesses, we'd very much like to have you double check those sensors. We've been getting poor readings in respiration from all three of you, and we'd like to have you report any anomalies in - in how they're rigged on you.
Roger. We'll do that.
You can send that down with the evening report.
Okay.
Right on. CapCom's hearing it. Just a little fainter than it was.
Roger.
A little bit earlier, ah...
15, this is Houston. Anytime you have the time to copy down about six lines of information, I could give you a general update on the UV filter photography. [Pause.]
Okay; stand by one, Karl. [Long pause.]
And, 15, we'd like to have you verify that the waste water dump has been terminated.
That's a verify. [Long pause.]
Okay, Karl; I'm ready to copy [the] Flight Plan change relative to the UV [photography].
Roger. The change is the same as I gave you before. When you're shooting the Earth, two frames with filter 2, at - what was formerly 2 frames with filter 2, exposure time 20 seconds, in the future, it will be one frame, filter 2 with an exposure time of 20 seconds. And one frame, filter 2, exposure time 2 seconds. And the following is the places that this occurs in the Flight Plan in the future. First is page 3-38, line 17. I believe we've probably passed that one already. The next one is - Negative, we haven't passed that one yet. The next one is page 3-57, line 16. The third is page 3-167 - both at 123 hours, 49 minutes and 123 hours, 56 minutes. The next is page 3-352, line 16. The next is page 3-378, line 16, and the final one is page 3-402 parenthesis, it says here, Earth UV line 16.
Roger. I copied all that, Karl.
Roger.
Houston, 15.
15, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Karl. Would you check the page for PTC, and let me know what that Verb 49 attitude is? It says, Verb 49 maneuver to PTC, Noun 20, 090 and 000. [Long pause.]
15, this is Houston. I understand that you used the present roll [angle]. The one you have now, I believe, is 169.6 [degrees] and, then, the other two numbers give you pitch and yaw.
Affirm. Roger, Karl; thank you. [Long pause.]
And, Houston, 15; we're maneuvering to PTC attitude now.
Roger, 15. We copy.
15, this is Houston. We'd like to have a LM/CM Delta-P whenever you can check that number for us?
Okay, Karl. Stand by one.
Okay, Houston; the Delta-P is point - plus .4 and we're going to secure the High Gain and give you Omni Bravo. [Pause.]
Roger, 15; we copy.
And, Houston, we're doing an O2 purge on the fuel cell. Presently purging fuel cell 3, and I'm getting a Fuel Cell 3 caution light.
Roger. We copy.
15, this is Houston; we'd like to have Omni Charlie. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15. Say again your last [transmission].
Roger. That last comment was to give us Omni Charlie [instead of Omni Bravo].
Rog. Charlie.
15, this is Houston.
Houston, 15; go ahead.
Your spacecraft [rotation] rates are low enough now to spin up for PTC, but we'd like for you to verify first that all of your dumping has been finished. [Pause.]
Karl, we'll hold off for a little bit here and finish up the dumping before we go into PTC.
Roger.
15, this is Houston. In connection with the respiration sensor problem, we'd like for you to - go through a special procedure for us before you - you doff your biomed harnesses.
Okay. Stand by one, Karl. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston; ready to copy special procedure.
I'm sorry. I didn't - I don't think it needs copying, but we'd like all three of you - when you go into the doffing phase here, we'd like all three of you to pull off the impedance pneumograms. Those are the two respiration sensors back on your kidneys there. Pull them off, and let any - let any trapped air get out, and then reseal them and give us a couple minutes of read-out down here to see if that improves the situation.
Roger. We'll do that. [Long pause.]
15, this is Houston. We can terminate the battery Bravo charging.
Roger.
Houston, this is 15. We've terminated the charge on battery B.
Roger, 15. We copy.
Houston, 15.
15, This is Houston.
Okay, Karlos. Looks like we're getting organized, and we'll go ahead with the PTC now. Do you have any preference on which [RCS] jets to use?
Roger. We'd like to use the B/D jets.
Understand. B/Ds. I guess that would be B-2, D-2, huh?
Say again, Al.
Guess that means you want us to use B-2 and D-2, huh?
That's affirmative. And we'd like you to - to hold the spin-up until we - Okay; we're able to give you a Go for spin-up now.
Okay; understand the rates are favorable for a spin-up DAP.
That's affirmative.
Okay, Karl, this is Apollo 15. If the rates still look good down there, we're ready to go to PTC.
That's affirmative, Al. Go ahead and spin her up. [Pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
We'd like to select Omni Bravo now. [Pause.]
Rog, Houston. Omni Bravo.
15, this is Houston. How's the view up there?
Houston, 15. It is fantastic, Karl. You ought to be here, man.
I'm eating my heart out. [Long pause.]
Karl, I think you said that just to be mean. [Long pause.]
And how does 13 hours of continuous zero-g feel? [Pause.]
Well, I think everybody is pretty well adjusted, Karl; no problems at all, and we've finished dinner and we're happy. [Pause.]
Very good.
15, this is Houston. On your PTC, when it started out, it looked okay; but we find that it's diverging now, and we're going to have to reinitialize it. We suggest this time around that we use a - a rate of .375 [degrees per second] in Noun 79, that might help.
Okay; .375 in Noun 79.
Houston, 15.
15, this is Houston.
Roger, Karl. When the rates look like they're down again, we'll try PTC again.
Roger. We'd like to have you verify that all the vents are secured before we spin it up again.
In work. [Pause.]
And, 15, in this damping process, we'd like to make sure that all of the jets on two adjacent quads are disabled.
Roger [garble]. [Long pause.]
And, 15, as a part of trying to figure out what went wrong with that first PTC, we'd like to know whether or not you went into any [gymnastic] exercise period after - after we spun it up.
That is negative, Karl.
Roger. [Long pause.]
And, Houston, the LMP and CDR have recycled their impedance pneumograms. You can give us a word if you see - if you see any improvement in data. [Long pause.]
Dave, we missed that last transmission. Could you say again?
Rog. The LMP and CDR have recycled the impedance pneumogram, and we just wondered if you'd seen any improvement in the data [coming from it].
Okay; he[SURGEON]'s looking at it now, and he says, yes, it has improved. [Long pause.]
15, the Surgeon says it's okay for the CDR and the CMP to doff their biomed harnesses now. Thank you.
Okay. Did that - did that recycling [of the biomedical sensors] do any good?
Roger. The recycling cleared up the respiration data we have down here very nicely.
Okay, good.
15, this is Houston. Everything down here looks good for the [PTC] spin-up.
Okay, Karl. We'll spin 'em up then.
15, this is Houston. I'm sorry to tell you that that spin-up didn't work very well. We're going to have to reinitialize again. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. We'll try it again.
And, Al, the - Stand by.
Rog, Karl. Hey, Houston, 15,
Go ahead.
Yeah, Karl, I think if there was a problem that time, it was because I hesitated just momentarily, thinking I had it Free, and I ended up in Hold.
Ah ha, thanks; thanks for the information.
Okay. [Long pause.]
And, 15, we think that your jet configurations were all okay that time around, but we'd like to confirm that, during damping, you disable all jets on two adjacent quads, and then for the spin-up, you use only B-2 and D-2.
That's affirm, Houston; that's affirm.
15, this is Houston. Everything down here looks Go for the spinup.
Okay, Karl. We'll try it once more.
15, that looked like a very good start.
Okay, Karl.
Fif - 15, this is Houston. [No answer.]
15, this is Houston.
Houston, 15. Go.
It looks like we've got it pretty well wrapped up for your rest period. We've got three or four small items to remind you here. Crew status report is outstanding; onboard readouts, we'd like; and whenever your ready, we're ready for an E-memory dump.
Okay. We're about that point of the checklist, and we'll give you the whole page at one time. Stand by one.
Okay.
Okay, Houston, 15. We're ready for the E-memory dump for you, if you're ready.
Okay, 15. We're ready to go with it.
Okay, here it comes. [Long pause.]
And, Houston, 15. We've got the rest of the presleep checklist if you're ready to copy. [Pause.]
Roger, 15. We're ready to copy.
Okay. Crew status report: everybody's in good shape; no medication today. Onboard readouts: Bat[tery] C, 37.0 [volts], Pyro Bat A, 37.2; Pyro Bat B, 37.2; RCS [tank] A, 94 [percent]; B ,92; C, 94; D, 94. And the water has been chlorinated; the H2 fans have been cycled; the valves are all verified; got your E-memory dump [done]. The cabin is at 5.7 [psi]. Direct O2 [valve] is closed, and I guess we're ready to go to sleep communications configurations. [Long pause.]
Roger, 15. We copy all of that, and the Surgeon has a question about - was - were there any obvious anomalies in the biomed harness?
No, as a matter fact, we were just discussing that. Al and I both have taken them off, and the sponges are all still quite damp and have their color and they're all sticking very well. I think the system looks real good.
Very good. Thank you.
Rog. [Long pause.]
15, this is Houston. I guess we're ready to go to the presleep comm configuration.
Roger.
Good night.
Okay; good night.
Incidentally, 15, your PTC's looking very good.
Oh, that's good. [Long pause.]
By the way, Karl, it's about time for you to get some sleep too, isn't it?
Rog. It's been a long day for all of us.
Yeah, I think you're a couple - three hours ahead of us.
Not that much.
Houston, 15. One more thing here. We note on page 1-24 of the Systems book in the comm sleep configuration, you've got the S-band Norm Voice [correcting himself] Norm Mode Voice, Off. Is that correct?
15, this is Houston. The noise was very bad then; are you reading me?
Okay, I'm reading you 5 by. Just had a question to verify the sleep configuration of the S-band. Is Mode Voice to Off?
That's affirmative.
That gives [garble] to Down Voice [Back-up].
That's affirmative.
Okay.
That gives us a little cleaner TM [telemetry].
Roger.
