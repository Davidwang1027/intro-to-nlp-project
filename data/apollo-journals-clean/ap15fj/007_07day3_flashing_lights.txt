Good morning, Apollo 15; this is Houston. Do you read? Over. [No answer.
Good morning, Apollo 15; this is Houston. Are you awake yet? Over.
Good morning, Houston; this is 15. Reading you loud and clear there, Joe. Good morning.
Good morning, Alfredo. It sounds like you had a good night's sleep. We're standing by for crew status.
Okay, Joe; we certainly did have a nice sleep, and we think your tracking data must be right, the Moon's getting bigger out the window.
Roger, Al. At least our direction is right.
appears that way. And, Joe, this is Al. We'll give you a status report here in about 5 minutes, when we get organized.
That sounds good, Alfredo. And if you'd like, I'm standing by down here with a PAO Gold Bugle Morning News, if you'd like to hear some?
Joe, can you stand by for a minute on that. We wouldn't want our LMP to miss it.
No, I agree; he should be aware of it. I'll stand by.
Joe, Jim's awake here now. Ready to listen.
Roger.
Okay, Apollo 15. This is your friendly news reporter with the morning news. Apparently the Houston Post reported, yesterday, that the Falcon's checkout went smoothly, and the mission is proceeding on schedule. The inside pages show drawings of how you will deploy the Lunar Roving Vehicle. They didn't tell us anything I think we don't already know so I won't go into the details of the drawings. In national news - Now, we may be use - losing communications now; I'll stand by a minute.
15, are you reading Houston clearly?
Rog, Joe; we're back with you.
All right. Moving right along, now, in national news, Secretary of Labor Hodgson has asked the United Transportation Union and the rail industry to put their dispute before a neutral panel for settlement. The U.S. Senate will vote today on an amendment to delay a federally guaranteed loan to Lockheed. The vote is expected to be very close. In local news, a Texas animal health commission employee said that he thinks that the Harris County vaccination program against sleeping sickness is almost at an end. I don't know if they're going to institute preflight quarantine on the animals or not. And more than a hundred people were arrested during a raid of the Arlington Country Club in Texas, last night, and gambling equipment was confiscated. Maybe you left town just in time. In sports, yesterday, the Baltimore Orioles increased their lead to four games in the American League East by winning the double header from the Oakland Athletics, 1-0 and 6-4. And the Houston Astro's split a twilight double header last night with the Phillies, 8 to 3 and 5 to 1. Muhammad Ali announced that - and I'll stand - all right, Muhammad Ali announced that he will fight Jerry Quarry, September, in the Astrodome and Ali also wants a rematch with Joe Frazier sometime in March, 1972. The Oilers have trimmed their roster to 59 players by placing two of the players, Johnny Peacock and Tom Smiley, on waivers. Four golfers were inducted into the American Golf Hall of Fame last night. They are Julius Boros, Cary Middlecoff, Jock Hutchinson, and the late Walter J. Travis. And we hate to tell you this, but Elizabeth Taylor is a grandmother, at age 39 when her 19-year-old daughter-in-law gave birth to a 6 pound, 2 ounce girl yesterday. And that's all from the Houston MOCR News Center.
Okay, Joe. Thank you very much for the weather and the news this morning.
Okay, Al. And I have a CSM consumables update and a number of other things, when you're ready to listen to them.
Okay, Joe; stand by one.
Roger.
Houston, this is 15. We are ready to copy the consumables update.
Al, stand by. We're not receiving you clearly.
Okay. We'll stand by.
Rog; it's very weak, and severe noise in the background, 15. We're standing by for better comm.
We understand.
Al, this is Houston. The noise seems to have quieted down again. Why don't we give it another try?
Okay, Joe. Would you like to copy our consumables and then you can pass up S-band.
Okay.
Okay, RCS, 90, 89, 90 and 89. On H2, 92, 90, 70. O2, 90, 90 and 85.
Roger, Jim. We copy all that. Let me give you a set of figures here. They agree very closely to what you've read to us. At GET 48 plus 00; the RCS total was 87; and then Quad A, 86, 87, 86, 87. H2 tank, 92, 92, 70. O2 tank, 90, 92, 85. Over.
Okay, I copied all those. As far as sleep, Dave figures 8 hours and two segments; Al was 8 hours for two; and I figure I got 9 hours in about three segments.
Roger; we copy that. Sounds like that's the most sleep you've had in several months. Out of curiosity, since we're coming up on this eye-flash experiment, I wonder if any of you has noticed any of the flashes yet?
Yes, we've noticed them both nights, Joe.
Okay; I guess we'll talk more about that a little later on. I have a number of other things to read up to you, in whatever order you'd like. They include a fairly extensive Flight Plan update; nothing profound but it will require some - certain amount of writing, and then a few miscellaneous questions which we'd like to ask you.
Ok - okay; I guess I can start on the - these Flight Plan bits.
Okay, Jim. And are you the recording secretary this morning?
Yes.
Okay, Jim. Before we start, did you get the radiation dosimeter readings for us?
We reported them last night. Do you want them again this morning?
Apparently, we'd like them again the - this - this morning on the schedule.
Okay; stand by.
Okay, Joe. I have a radiation report for you.
Go ahead.
Okay, radiation. On Dave, it's 23023; Al, 25009; and mine is 08010.
We copy those, Jim; thank you. And normally, I guess, we'd like to have those in the postsleep period as opposed to presleep, which is when we got them yesterday. I guess it's in the checklist that way.
Okay, we'll - okay, we'll normally do it that way.
Okay; fine, and I'm ready to start with the Flight Plan update. When you're set up to copy up there, I'll start at about 54:50.
Okay, let me get 54:50.
Fine, Jim. And we're coming up on a Omni switch. When we're on the new antenna, I'll start to read. You might want also your LM Activation Checklist handy because we'll be using it later on.
Okay.
Houston, how do you read 15?
Jim, you're loud and clear, and we're ready down here if you are.
Okay. I'm at 54:50 on the Flight Plan.
Okay. Before I start into it step by step, let me just say that it's basically - the - the change is basically moving some of the items around in time, and there's not many changes in procedures involved. The one main thing is, we're going to ask you to go into - into the LM a little early, I guess, earlier then you had planned. And we're going to also request that you give us enough - you bring enough of the telemetry online so we look at the - can look at the LM batteries. And there's no particular reason we want to do this today - nothing that we suspect is wrong - but rather, apparently, the systems people are interested in a better granularity in the data points that they're taking on these batteries. That's the reason for this particular addition. Other than that, I think there's nothing at all very different about this Flight Plan update, other than a few minor changes. And I'll go ahead and start if you're ready.
Okay, I'm ready Joe. And we understand.
Okay; 54:50, the step "If LM/CM Delta-P less than 2.7 psid, LM Tunnel Vent valve, panel 12, vent until Delta-P greater than 2.7 psid."
Okay. I have "If LM/CM Delta-P is less than 2.7 psid, LM Tunnel Vent valve on panel 12, vent until Delta-P greater than 2.7 psid."
That's correct. Now turn one page to 55 plus 15.
Okay; I'm there.
Okay. Insert "Stop PTC at roll 50 degrees. High Gain Antenna angles: Pitch, minus 48; Yaw, plus 82."
Roger. "At 55:15, stop PTC roll 50 degrees; High Gain Antenna: Pitch, minus 48; Yaw, plus 82."
That's correct. Now, turn back several pages to 3-54 please. And that's the "Cycle film in Pan and Map Cameras" page - procedures page.
Okay; I have it.
Okay. Down near the bottom, delete the line "SM Sector 1, SM/AC Power, Off." And add in its place "Map Camera on" - that should read "Map Camera on Standby/talkback gray." Over.
Okay; understand. Delete "SM Sector 1 SM/AC Power off," and add "Mapping Camera on to Standby/talkback gray."
That's correct. Now, turn back to 55 plus 50, and there's a long series of deleted activities that will follow. These - all because we're not going to do a midcourse 3, as you're well aware. And I'll call them out line by line, and they'll carry through for - I guess about a page and a half here. At 55:00.
Okay; go ahead.
Delete "P30 External Delta-V" and "V49 Maneuver to PAD Burn Att." Turn the page. Jim, I apparently made a mistake on that. That should have been at 55:50. I think you're at the right - the right place. Continuing on over to 50...
Yes; I got it.
Rog. Continuing to 56 plus 00, delete the next seven lines up to the 2 lines which you should leave in "O2 Fuel Cell Purge" and "Waste Water Dump."
Okay; I have that.
Okay. Continuing - continue deleting the lines below that, down to 57 plus 00.
Okay. So the only two actions we have on that page, 56 hours, is the "O2 Fuel Cell Purge" and the "Waste Water Dump."
That's affirm. Now, once again backing up to the time, 55 plus 50. That should read "Verb 49 Maneuver to LM Checkout Attitude." And that attitude is "305, 090, 000." High Gain angle: "Pitch, minus 30; Yaw, 276."
Okay. "Verb 49 Maneuver to LM Checkout Attitude" at 55:50; the attitude "305, 090, and 000; High Gain: Pitch, minus 30; and Yaw, 276."
Readback's correct, Jim. I'll stand by until we get another Omni change.
Okay.
15, Houston. Our comm's quieted down again, and I'll continue if you're ready.
Okay. I'm ready, Joe.
Roger, Jim. At 56 plus 50, start "CSM Systems Checklist, IVT to LM," and this is an item that's moved up from 57:20, by the way.
Okay, at 56:50, start "CSM checklist, IVT to LM."
That's correct, and you're to start that checklist from the beginning. And at 57 plus 00, you move the CSM PTC procedures to completion of our LM battery checkout. And I guess that's an item for Al.
Okay; understand. I'll move all that there for the PTC until after we complete the battery checkout.
That's correct, and that should come around 57 plus 50 or perhaps a little later. But, once again, not time critical. We're coming up on 57 plus 30. And, if you'll take out your LM Activation Checklist, page 1-1, please.
Okay; I have it.
Okay. And this is to start at 57 plus 30. Perhaps you should put a mark in your time line, but then on - on the checklist from page 1-1, delete "Comm carrier, CWG connector." Delete step 2. Delete step 5.
Okay. On 1-1, I delete "Comm carrier, CWG connector;" step 2; and step 5.
That's affirm. Do page 1-13. And if you'll turn to that, do 1-13 except in step 2.
In step 2, delete "VHF B Transmitter, Close; VHF A Receiver, Close; CDR Audio, Close." And add the instruction "CB 11, ECS Cabin Fan, Close."
Okay, Joe. On 1-13, under step 2, to delete "VHF B Transmitter, Close; VHF A Receiver, Close; Commander Audio, Close." And add "CB 11, ECS Cabin Fan, Close."
That's correct, Jim. Do page 1-14, except in step 5. Delete "VHF A Transmitter, Close; VHF B Receiver, Close;" and delete step 6.
Okay. On 1-14, we'll do all that. Under step 5, we'll delete "VHF A Transmitter, Close; VHF B Receiver, Close;" and want to delete step 6.
Readback's correct, and add step 7. Your comm S-band configuration is "PM, Secondary, Primary, Off; PCM, Off/Reset, Off, and High."
Okay. The S-band configuration is "PM, Secondary, Primary, Off; PCM Off/Reset, Off, and High."
That's correct. We'll want you to stay in that configuration for 15 minutes while we take the data. After that time, do page 1-18 and 1-19.
Understand, to stay in that configuration for 15 minutes, then do 1-18 and 1-19.
Okay, Jim. Sounding fine. Now, back into your time line. At 57 plus 45, proceed with LM housekeeping. And we've got some words here on the housekeeping. I'll read them to you, and I guess - Copy down whatever you think you haven't done yet.
Okay; understand. At 57:45. We're to proceed with LM housekeeping, and go ahead with the - your steps, Joe. I'll note them down.
Okay. Vacuum Cabin Fan filter. And as a subgroup under this, you unsnap netting around Cabin Fan filter.
Then you vacuum the filter. But do not scrub bristles of the vacuum cleaner over the surface of filter. Then, you remove the remaining particles on Cabin Fan filter with sticky tape, using care not to dislodge filter material.
Then, you remove the particles on the inlet screen of the vacuum cleaner with sticky tape; and, finally, replace the netting.
And, Jim, that's the end of that procedure. Our comm's starting to fade out on us, so we may not be able to copy you. Hopefully, you're copying us clearly still.
Yes, we are, Joe. I got that.
Okay, Jim. And just an added note on that. As you're well aware, we're interested in cleaning up as many of those flying glass particles as we can, which is primarily the reason for - for this procedure.
Yeah; we quite agree, Joe.
Okay. At the time, 57 plus 45, the steps "S-band Aux, TV to Science, Pan Camera Power to On," and then, in parenthesis "for five minutes/Off." And finally, "S-band Aux, TV to Off."
Okay, Joe. At 57:45, understand you want the "S-band Aux, TV to Science." Then I missed the information after - after that, and then, finally, the last one was "S-band Aux, TV to Off."
Okay, Jim. What we're interested in here is looking at the Pan Camera temperature. And the center step, the one you missed, reads "Pan Camera Power to On for five minutes and then Off."
Okay; understand. "Pan Camera Power to On for five minutes and then to Off."
That's correct. At 57 plus 50, "CSM proceed with PTC activation."
Okay. At 57:50, "CSM proceed with PTC activation."
Roger. And turning over a page to 60 hours. After the step, "S-band Aux, TV, Off," add "Pan Camera Self Test to Off." And...
Stand by, Joe.
Joe, do you read me now?
Okay, Jim. Reading you loud and clear.
That last information you gave me on S-band Aux, TV. I add that - I added that in at 57:45. Is that correct?
Jim, no; negative. Turn over the page to 60 hours, 60 plus 00.
Okay; I have 60 hours.
Okay, Joe. I'm at 60 hours.
Okay, Jim. This is a new step completely at 60 hours. We did say something at 57:45. I'll come back to that in a minute to make sure that's straightened around. But at 60 hours, after the step in the Flight Plan, S-band Aux, TV to Off, add 2 steps. And they are "Pan Camera, Self Test to Off" and "Map Camera On, to Off." Over.
Okay; understand. Two steps there after "S-band Aux, TV, Off." "Pan Camera, Self Test, Off" and "Pan Camera On, to Off."
That sounds - that sounds good, Jim.
Let's go back to 57:45.
Okay, Jim. At 57:45, the three steps you added in there should be "S-band Aux, TV to Science; Pan Camera Power, On for 5 minutes and then Off; and S-band Aux, TV, Off."
Okay; understand that. I guess I got a little confused there, Joe, when you said turn the page, and you turn several pages to get to 60 hours.
I think you caught me in that. I guess I did. Sorry.
Okay. I'm ready to go on to the next one, Joe.
Okay, Jim. That completes the Flight Plan update, and you should know by now that you have to take me for what I mean, not for what I say. I do have...
We do.
Rog. I do have a note, which you can put down in the margin or wherever, and it involves subsequent P23 sightings if required.
Okay.
And the note is "Reduce trunnion to less than 10 degrees before zeroing optics." And then, "Always do optics calibration after optics zero in P23."
Okay, Joe. For subsequent P23 sightings, we're to reduce the trunnion to less than 10 degrees before zeroing optics, and always do the optics cal after the optics zero in P23.
That's exactly right, Jim. And that is all I have on my Flight Plan update. I guess we've got an afterthought here. I'll get with you in a minute. I do have some other questions which I'd like to ask, but let me give you this addition while you have the Flight Plan there on your lap. And it involves the time 56 plus 20. I'll stand by when you're there.
Okay. I'm at 57 - 56:20.
Okay. The step is "Direct O2, Open until cabin pressure equals 5.7 psia."
Okay; understand. At 56:20, "Direct O2, Open until cabin pressure equals 5.7 psia."
That's correct.
And, Jim. I'm going to wait until the comm gets a little better before I continue on here. Be a - a minute or so.
Okay.
Apollo 15, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Jim, we've got about 3 or 4 small questions for you. Your choice whether you'd like to talk about them now or proceed on with the light flash experiment.
No. We're going to delay that light flash experiment anyway until we get cleaned up here and have breakfast. So you can ask - ask the questions. We'll be thinking about it while we're cleaning up.
Okay. That sounds good. Our first one: we noted a very small load change on battery bus A yesterday, several minutes prior to your SPS burn, and we're trying to - to chase down what may have caused this. We suspect that you may have - have closed two circuit breakers that should have been closed and just are curious to know if you did close them, or if, when you looked to verify them, they were already closed. And, the circuit breakers in question are the SPS Pitch 1 and Yaw 1 circuit breakers that feed Bat A.
Okay. We - we closed those per checklist, Joe.
Jim, I understand you closed them for the checklist. By that do you mean that you - when you looked at them, you found them open and closed them?
Okay. That's affirm, Joe. They were open, and we closed them per the checklist.
Okay. The guys in the back room here psyched that out pretty well, I guess. Thank you. That - I guess that was a question mostly of academic interest. Al, the circuit breaker in the Lower Equipment Bay, AC2, is still out as you're well aware, and it affects a number of EL and DSKY lights and so on, and we'll want to talk to you later on today about this. It should be no problem in any way, but we do want to talk about - discuss ramifications of the - of the various workarounds which this may involve. And, finally, we've been noting during the night some small oscillations in accumulator quantity, and we'd like for you, please, to check your secondary radiators. Verify that's in bypass. That's panel 377.
Okay. We're checking panel 377 now.
Okay.
Okay, Joe. On that - on that valve on 377. It was in Bypass, and Dave just cycled it to - cycled it to Normal and then back to Bypass.
Okay, Jim. Thank you. And that's all we have down here for the time being. I've been reading the Apollo 15 status report that's put out every two hours. What's normally several pages, is just a page today. And - with very few words on it, the most prominent one being the word nominal, the meaning of which I'm going to look up as soon as I get off this shift.
Very good.
And, Jim, unless you have any questions, why don't you proceed on with a comfortable breakfast, and we'll be standing by for a callout of when your ready to continue.
Okay, Joe. Thank you.
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, 15. This is Houston.
Okay, Houston. We're getting ready to do the light flash experiment, and we'd like to run the tape recorder so we can get the voice marks on it, if that won't interfere with any of your.
Okay, Dave. Stand by. I'll inquire.
Okay.
Tunnel Vent valve.
15, this is Houston.
Houston, 15.
Roger. In answer to your question on the DSE, we'll handle the DSE from down here when we start the eye flash experiment. We do have a - a request of you before you start the experiment, though. We don't have the necessary oxygen purity in the LM yet that we think that we're going to need for the surface EVAs several days from now. And - consequently, we want you to start to vent the LM once again. We're going to drain it out and fill it with oxygen again later on today. So, if you would please, turn the Tunnel Vent valve to the Vent position before we start the eye flash.
Okay, Joe. That's in work.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. And we'll take a couple of minutes here and run a hatch integrity check and make sure it's all fixed up, and we'll be with you in about 5.
Roger, Dave. Sounds good.
Okay, Houston; 15. The Tunnel the hatch looks good, we're willing to start the experiment.
Okay, Dave. We're standing by. And I could give you a few reminders on the experiment here, if you'd like them.
Okay. Go ahead.
Rog. We're just interested - in primarily a mark from each of the three of you when you notice a - a flash. And then, you might indicate who it is calling it out and then a description, as you see it: position, color, etc., etc. And - if - any - if another one of you notices one in the meantime during the description, call 'Mark' and that one then takes precedent. Over.
Okay. That's about the way we talked it over, Joe. We're all set. Thank you.
Rog.
And, Dave, we'll be standing by for when...
Okay, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. If you'll start the tape recorder, we'll start.
Roger, Dave.
Okay; Houston, 15. We're starting.
Roger.
Dave, this is Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Dave. And just wanted to make sure you - you understood that we'd also prefer the mark on real time comm, as well.
Well, all right.
15, this is Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Dave. Since I've hadn't heard anything, I'll assume you haven't noticed anything yet. And I'm assuming, also, that you are wearing your eyemasks.
message, Joe, and the window shades are up, and the cabin is dark.
Okay. Thank you.
And we're concentrating pretty hard.
Mark LMP.
Roger.
Mark CMP.
Rog, Al.
And, Al, any sensation other than just a flash?
Negative, Joe.
Okay.
LMP Mark.
Mark CMP.
Mark CDR.
Roger.
Mark CDR.
Rog, Dave. And is it a - just a pinpoint, or a streak, or what?
All coming on the DSE, Joe.
Okay.
We can give you that, but it might get confusing.
Mark CDR.
Houston, so far we've all seen just point sources of light, rather than streaks.
Okay, Dave. And some of us are a bit...
Mark CMP.
Roger.
15, this is Houston. If you see something significantly different from the point source, we'd like a real-time voice description of it, as well as a DSE recorded.
Okay, Houston. Fine. It's just that when we're trying to talk back and forth with the time delay, it's going to get confusing on the comm for us to try and record... Mark CDR.
Understand, Dave.
Mark LMP.
Rog.
Mark LMP. And this one did have a - a streak nature to it. Like it went from 8 o'clock over to the plus X position.
Rog.
Mark CMP.

Roger.
Mark CDR.
Mark LMP.
Mark CDR.
Mark CDR.
Mark CDR.
Mark CDR.
Okay, Houston. We've got 60 minutes up here. How's your clock look?
Dave. We're coming up on 60 minutes here too. And I've - I think that's certainly an adequate period. A couple of quick questions, though. Could you describe for us briefly your positions in the spacecraft during this time?
Okay. We've got it - several comments for you, Joe. Let us un - uncouple here, and we'll talk to you for a while about this.
Roger.
Okay. Houston, 15. I guess - we realize the interest behind this and the significance of the thing and - and we'll each try and describe what we saw in the way of the flashes. And I think - because of the randomnum - randomness of the flashes, it was probably better to let us go ahead and work out the events on the DSE. And I think, also, you'll find on the DSE, when you review the tape, that we've come up with a little scheme to give you some quantitative data, which may or not - may not be the best. And if you have any suggestions on future tests or how we can make it a little better for you, we'd be glad to hear that. As to our positions in the spacecraft, we're in our launch - reenter and launch positions; I'm in the left, and Al's in the center, and Jim's in the right. Do you still copy?
Roger, Dave. Loud and clear.
Okay, I guess - as far as my impressions, I would say 90 per cent of them were what I'd call a point source of light. And to give you perhaps an analogy, you might picture yourself sitting high in the stands of the - of the Ice Capades with the arena darkened and some single figure on the - on the ice, like Peggy Fleming, doing a nice thing. And you look across at the other side of the - the dark arena and somebody shoots a flashbulb out of their Instamatic or something, and that would be what I'd call a - a typical flash of intensity 5 on a scale 1 to 5, and we tried to sort these out relative to their intensities. And that - that would be my impression of 90 per cent of what I saw.
Roger.
Okay, let Al give you his impressions.
Okay, Joe. I guess I didn't see the same thing that Dave did - and - talking about the intensity, I guess that's a very subjective thing. But I guess the analogy with the flashbulb was pretty good for the brighter intensities, and it seems like there was - there was one flash maybe that was of an intensity in the majority of the.
Hey, Al - Stand - Al, stand by. Stand by.
Al, we're starting to lose you because we're changing our Omnis now. Could you stand by a second, and I'll give you a call back.
Okay, Joe.
15, while you're standing by waiting for the Omni to come around where we can read you more clearly - Dave, that was a very, very nice description of the flashes. Of course, we're very pleased with the - apparently, the intensity values that you put on the - on the DSE. And I think our comm - comm is starting to improve here, Al, so I'll be standing by for your continued description.
Okay, Joe. I guess in addition to - to what's been said already, most of the light flashes seem to be of the order of flashcubes or maybe starbursts that you've seen in the summertime. I saw very few streaks or radial paths of light. They all seem to be just point sources of light, and - and I guess that's really about all I've got to add, Joe; I'll - I'll see if Jim's got something.
Roger.
Joe, I just have one comment, that's on the tape. And that is, just after the timing ended, we were taking - about to take our masks off, I had one - very brilliant streak....
Stand by - stand by.
at nine o'clock...
Jim, stand by a second. Our comm's starting to drop out again, and it may be a partial problem with your microphone position. Stand by just a second though, please.
Okay, Jim. We have comm again. Proceed on.
Roger. I wanted to comment on one brilliant streak that I had just after the timing period had ended, and I was about - I was in the process of taking the mask off, and there was a brilliant streak, intensity 5, that went from the 9 o'clock position - through 12 o'clock - and out the 3 o'clock.
Roger, Jim. We copy that. And could you tell us which eye that one was in?
Well, it seemed like it went from the left eye to the right eye.
Okay; very interesting. Endeavour, the Principal Investigators on this, Dick Benson and Larry Pinsky, have followed it closely and are quite pleased, I think, with the data you've given us; they'll be looking at the DSE information in detail and may have a - some definite procedure changes to give to you later, based on the information you've given us so far. And I guess as far as we're concerned, we have no more questions.
Okay; fine, Joe. We'll be standing by and I - I guess another thing that - that you've picked up - interesting thing, is that the - the flashes are quite easily located relative to either eye or the position within either eye, which I think we found rather interesting.
That's remarkable, Dave. Right; thank you.
15, when you get squared away there, we'll be looking for - your starting to charge battery B, battery Bravo.
Rog. Understand. And I might add one more comment that - in discussing that - that last one, why, Jim didn't quite have that impression of localization within each eye, although Al and I both do.
Okay.
Jim, this is Houston again. I have a small addition to your Flight Plan update which I can give you whenever convenient for you.
Okay; stand by.
Roger; whenever convenient, Jim. No hurry on it at all.
Battery charge B is in process.
Roger.
Okay, Joe. I'm ready to copy these additional comments you have for the Flight Plan.
Roger, Jim. The first one is at 53 hours exactly, and it's just a note for you information.
All right, go ahead.
Roger. In the left-hand side of the Flight Plan there, the "lift off time." Note that it is not required in this case so we don't have to worry about that. The - second change - is possibly not a change: at 60 hours, six zero hours, I wanted to double check your readback of the addition which I gave to you earlier. And it should read, at 60 hours: "Pan Camera Self Test, Off," and "Map Camera On, to Off." wanted to double check that last step.
Roger. I have both of those, Joe, and they occur after the "S-band Aux TV, Off."
Okay; thank you very much, Jim. The third change is an addition to the LM Activation Checklist changes which I gave you earlier.
Is it in the Activation Checklist or is it in the Flight Plan?
I think you copied it in the LM Activation Checklist on page 1-13.
Roger.
Okay. I'm on 1-13 of the Activation Checklist.
Okay, Jim. After the addition on that page, which read, "Circuit breaker 11, ECS Cabin Fan, Closed," add: "Circuit breaker 11, EPS: DC Bus Volt, Closed."
Okay; copy: "CB 11, EPS: DC Bus Volt, Closed."
Okay, Jim. That's it from down here for a while.
15, Houston.
Houston, 15. Go.
Roger; Dave. The next time one of you floats past the LM/CM Delta-P gauge, could you get a readout for us please.
Roger; stand by.
Roger; no hurry.
2.0.
Copy 2.0. Thank you.
Roger.
Apollo 15, go to P00 and Accept, please, for a clock sync update.
Roger. P00 and Accept.
Your computer, Dave.
Roger.
Dave is that time okay?
Rog. We're within about - 1200 to the mission timer.
Sounds pretty good to me.
That's the old Noun 65 trick.
Rog. I guess I should have said 12 centiseconds.
Oh Yes. Mercy, yes.
Oh yeah.
15, Houston. Requesting Block on the Up TM.
Oh, Rog. Thank you.
Hello, Houston, 15.
Hello, 15, this is Houston.
Hey, Joe, I just did a Delta-V and null bias check if you want to copy some numbers.
Go ahead, Al.
Okay, the Delta-V check was - test was satisfactory. It was a residual minus 21.0 in ten seconds, and the null bias was.8 feet in 100 seconds.
Okay, Al. We copy. Thank you.
And, Al, this is Houston.
Yeah, go ahead, Joe.
Roger. Will you be starting into your lunch break now?
Affirmative.
Okay. That sounds like a good idea.
15, Houston. If anyone by chance floats past the LM/CM Delta-P gauge, we'd like another read-out.
Okay, Joe. We'll get that for you.
Apollo 15, Houston.
Houston, 15. Go ahead, Joe.
Roger, Al. Would you tell Jim, please, that I've got a - a change Echo to his LM Activation Checklist, when he finishes with lunch and wants to copy it down. No hurry on it, but I don't want to forget it.
Okay, Joe. I'll tell him.
15, Houston.
Houston, 15. Go.
Roger. The next time somebody goes down into the kitchen to mix up some food, could you read the Delta-P gauge for us, please.
Roger. It's 1.9.
Copy 1.9. Thank you.
15, Houston.
Houston, 15. Go.
Rog, Dave. As luck would have it, we lost our comm just as we got the Delta-P number from you. We copied 1.9. Verify that for us, please. And, also, would you make sure that the valve is still in the Vent position.
Roger. I checked that. It's LM Tunnel Vent and it's, well - 1.9 to 2 - pretty close.
Okay, Dave. Thank you. Just leave it in that position.
Roger.
15, this is Houston. We have a further question about that LM Tunnel Vent valve.
Okay; go ahead, Joe.
Roger, Dave. We should have had a much greater drop in pressure - during the - the time between these two readings. We want to confirm that you went to the Delta-P position to read the meter this second time. Over.
Oh, no. I thought you just wanted the reading in the Vent position.
No, sir. Apparently we have to go over to Delta-P, get a reading, and then go - return to the Vent position.
Yeah, that's absolutely correct, Joe. Thank you. We'll do that.
Okay. In the LM/CM Delta-P - it's 2.9, and then back to LM Tunnel Vent it's 3.5.
Okay, Dave. We copy that. Sounds so much better.
Yes, it sure does, doesn't it.
Houston, this is 15.
Roger, 15; go ahead.
Joe, I understand you have another change to the Activation Checklist.
Roger, Jim, I had to change Echo for you. I'm up to change Foxtrot already, if you're ready to copy.
I'm ready to copy, Joe
Okay. Nothing very profound here. It - it has to do with the LM housekeeping/cleaning procedures I read to you at 57 plus 45. And the procedures which I read were basically a cleaning of the vacuum Cabin Fan filter. And it involved unsnapping a netting around the Cabin Fan filter, running the vacuum cleaner over it, and finally replacing that netting. And we've had second thoughts about that entire procedure down here - mainly, because the netting is in too cramped an area to get to comfortably - it takes a long time to take the netting off and replace it, and the - the procedure is, actually, not too effective, anyway. So - we want you to delete this entire step, and I have two more to add instead of this particular step at 57 plus 45. Am I clear so far?
Ah, yes, you're clear so far. Do you still want us to turn the cabin fan on?
Roger, Jim. In fact, the procedure now reads like this. Before you begin the LM Activation Checklist and you're entering the LM, we want you to vacuum all the LM accessible areas such as Velcro, places like that, where dirt and particularly glass particles have accumulated. Then, when you've cleaned it to your satisfaction, tape the vacuum cleaner to the engine cover. Let it run while you're doing the rest of the housekeeping activities. Over.
Okay; I understand, Joe.
Okay, Jim. And then, finally when you're through with the housekeeping activities, clean the vacuum cleaner inlet screen with sticky tape. We think you'll probably find glass particles there which you can remove conveniently with the sticky tape.
Okay; I copy.
Okay, Jim. That's all I had for you really.
Joe, this is 15 again.
Go ahead.
Roger. Did you confirm that you still want us to turn the cabin fan on?
That's correct. We - we confirm that. We want the cabin fan turned on.
Okay. And assume if we - if we should see any glass on the cabin fan filter, then I suppose we should try to get down there with tape and clean it off.
Roger, Jim. That's right. It just - we do not now want you to unsnap the netting around that cabin fan filter, in spite of what we told you earlier. It still might be possible to clean that area with sticky tape - without unsnapping the netting, though.
Okay; I understand.
Basically, as - I know you understand. We - we just want as much of the glass in the LM cleaned up as you can find.
Okay. I think we cleaned it up pretty well yesterday, but we'll do it again.
Roger. Just look around. It may not take much at all to take it.
