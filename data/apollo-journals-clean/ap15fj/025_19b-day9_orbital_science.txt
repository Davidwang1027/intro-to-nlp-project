[Garble].
Well, I think I'd - stick it under the couch there. That's where I kept it before. But, of course - Huh?
[Garble].
[Laughter]
[Garble].
May be, David. The empty ones, you mean. Oh, that's what you're talking about. Empty one. Yes. Yes. A-2.
Okay, Jimmy, you got 8 minutes to go.
[Garble].
Hey, listen. You - you - you're bugging me a little bit. If you're going - if you're going to exercise, you ought to at least have the decency to put your biomed on (laughter). There's no sense wasting all that on us. Let the doc see it.
Ooh, applesauce. Their applesauce is good stuff.
You have Cannon towels, no doubt.
Yes.
I think I've been holding this many of them before.
Oh, yes. Yes, we were in darkness about the time ... We'll be on the dark side for about 20 minutes now.
Two minutes to go, Jim.
Hey, Jim.
Okay, Jim.
[Garble] regular [garble] heartbeat.
Huh? Yes. After - after a while it gets to be working, moving your legs around again, you know?
[Garble].
[Garble] boy, oh boy.
How do you mean?
No?
Oh, my eyes - my eyes were playing funny tricks on me for a while. [Garble]?
So am I. Yes.
I'll think I'll see a - yes. Yes.
Oh, yes, I seem to be getting them.
Well, that's like a [garble].
Too early.
No. My brain is seeing them when you're not.
Hey, Dave, you any good at putting hot water in?
Oh, God, yes. Let's - Okay.
How about doing some pea soup for me when you get around to it?
Huh? Where's your spoon, Jimmy?
Is it in here?
[Garble] Jimmy's spoon.
It's in the - oh, okay. [Garble].
You mean like these?
What spoon?
How many?
Oh! Gee, what'd I do? Try to get rid of them?
What?
You're getting [garble] for a [garble].
Yes.
[Garble].
[Garble]. [Clears throat]
Yes.
[Garble].
Watch it. He'll be bitching about that.
[Garble].
Yes.
Give it to Al.
Give me the little white tool.
Thank you, Dave.
[Garble] got in the way here.
[Garble].
Yes. It really is. Yes. I wish you guys would go somewhere.
[Garble].
Because he doesn't want the gray to show.
[Garble].
[Laughter] He'd be perfectly happy if we had pens instead of erasers.
[Laughter]
[Garble].
Hey, how about exporting it?
[Garble]. Yes. [Garble].
[Garble].
You guys [garble]?
[Garble].
[Garble].
[Garble], Dave.
Where? I don't see [garble]. Huh?
Right there.
[Garble].
Yes. I can see [garble].
[Laughter]
Don't forget, we got [garble].
Yes.
What a sport.
What a sport!
[Garble].
You are.
[Laughter] Yes. Yes.
Enough!
Yes.
Enough's enough. [Garble].
Yes.
[Garble]...
Hello, Endeavour. This is Houston requesting Reacq and Narrow. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston [garble] Endeavour [garble.] [Long pause.]
Okay, Al, thank you very much. Some time during this pass, we're going to be requesting an ISA [Interim Stowage Assembly] weight which you have in your Lunar Surface Checklist, page 3-2. And we'll have a Map Camera and a Pan Camera PAD to send up to you. [Long pause.]
Okay, Joe. That all sounds very good. [Long pause.]
Endeavour, this is Houston. We're showing your Mapping Camera not on at this time and are requesting it on. It may be just to reverify from your 198 plus 32 plus 10 on the Flight Plan. Over.
Rog, Joe.
Endeavour, this is Houston. We copy the Gamma-ray Gainstep, Shield, On. And Al, we have photo PADs to you when you're ready to copy. Over.
Okay, Joe. Go ahead.
Okay. In your Flight Plan, at 199:20, you can strike PCM Cable, unless your relativistic speed has managed to lengthen that cable, I guess. At 199:25, you can strike the 3 lines "CMC Mode, Verb 22, and CMC Mode." And, then I have a PAD for you at 200 plus 20, when you're ready. [Pause.]
Rog. Go ahead with the PAD at 200:20.
Okay, Al. At this time, it's a camera configuration for terminator photos that we missed a little earlier. And the lines should read "CM4/EL/250/VHBW, IVL, f/5.6 at 1/125th, infinity, six frames, Mag Romeo." Over. [Pause.]
Rog, Joe. Understand. Terminator photo PAD at 200 plus 20 is CM4/EL/250/VHBW, and that's with the intervalometer, IVL, at f/5.6, 1/125th, infinity, six frames and Mag R.
Readback's correct, Al. And, the next entry is at - 200 plus 25, which is open the Map Camera covers and extend the camera per page S/1-39. And, at that time, Map Camera, Image Motion to On. And then, coming up to the time 200 plus 27 plus 56, EL On; and 200 plus 29 plus 36. EL Off. At the time 200 plus 30 plus 36, Map Camera, On; Image Motion, Increase; talkback to barber pole, plus 4 steps; Laser Altimeter to On; Pan Camera Mode to Standby, Power, On; Stereo, Exposure, Normal. Over. [Pause.]
Roger, Joe. At 200 plus 25, open Mapping Camera covers and extend the Mapping Camera. Turn the Image Motion, On. At 275 - 200:27:56, EL On, and at 29:36, EL Off. At 30:36 Mapping Camera, On; Image Motion to barber pole, plus four; and Laser, On. And then Pan Camera, Standby, Power, On; Stereo, Exposure, Normal.
That's correct, Al. And continuing on through a few more steps here, and I'll read them all, and then stand by for your readback. 200 plus 33 plus 29, Pan Camera, Mode to Operate. 200 plus 49 plus 32, Pan Camera to Mono. 200 plus 54 plus 27, Pan Camera, Stereo. 200 plus 59 plus 22, Pan Camera, Mode, Standby; Pan Camera, Power to Off on MSFN cue. And, moving right along, 201 plus 17 plus 00, Pan Camera, Image Motion, Increase. I'm sorry, Al. That was misread. That should be Map Camera, Image Motion to Increase; talkback barber pole. 201 plus 28 plus 21, EL On. 201 plus 30 plus 01, EL Off. 201 plus 30 plus 21, Map Camera, Off; Laser Altimeter, Off. And the final one, 201 plus 32 plus 00, retract camera and close covers per the page in your checklist. Over. [Long pause.]
Roger, Joe. Understand at 201:17:00, Mapping Camera, Image Motion, Increase to barber pole; at 201:28:21, EL On; at 201:30:01, EL Off; 201:32:00, Off. No, back to 30:01, after EL Off, read Map Camera, Off; Laser, Off. And, at 201:32:00, retract and close the Mapping Camera covers.
Okay, Al. And read back to me 4 more lines, beginning with 200 plus 33 plus 29. You didn't go back quite far enough, and that - that one should read Pan Camera, Mode to Operate.
Oh, okay.
And I'm standing by.
Roger. At - at 33 - at 200:33:29, Pan Camera to Operate. At 49:32, Pan Camera to Mono. At 54:27, Pan to Stereo. And, at 59:22 Pan to Standby; Power, Off, on MSFN cue. [Long pause.]
Okay, Al. Sounds real good. But double check for me one line, which I may have goofed. It's the 201 plus 30 plus 21, Map Camera, Off; Laser Altimeter, Off. [Pause.]
Roger, Joe. Understand. At 201:30:21, that's 20 seconds after EL Off, we get the Mapping Camera, Off and the Laser, Off.
Yes sir, that's affirmative. And, I guess - we're still waiting for an ISA weight. Other than that, we're doing real fine.
Okay, Joe. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15.
Go. [Pause.] Go ahead, Al. And, we're waiting for a Image Motion talkback to barber pole.
Okay. Dave's going to get the ISA weight out for you and call you.
Okay. If he's able to weigh it right there, I'd like to know how he's going to do it. I assume he's got it written down, though.
He's got it written down. He just has to get it out.
Houston. This is 15.
Go ahead, 15. [Pause.]
Yes, Joe. I have weight information on the ISA. The ISA total was 64 pounds, which includes bags 4 and 6, and 8 pounds return items. And the ISA, by itself, without anything loaded in it, was 8 pounds. Over.
Okay, Jim, copied that. Sounds like there might be a stone or two in there. [Pause.]
Yeah. Bags 4 and 6, for sure. [Pause.]
Thank you, Jim.
Apollo 15. We'd like Gamma-ray Shield, On, please. [Pause.]
Roger, Dr. Parker. Shield, On. [Long pause.]
And, 15. Time to start the terminator [photography] now.
Rog.
Mapping Camera, Standby, please. [Long pause.]
Rog. Standby. [Long pause.]
Laser Altimeter, Off, please.
Apollo 15, Houston. If you have a chance, we'd like to talk to Dave and Jim about this LCG connector problem some time.
Okay, stand by.
And Auto on High Gain [Antenna], please.
Auto. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15. Go. [Pause.]
15. Two questions we'd like to ask. First one's specific, and that is, if you noticed anything about the connector between the LCG and the suit when you took it out in order to put the plugs in yesterday afternoon. Was it already out? Was it loose? Was it not lock-locked? Or what? And secondly, a general question building up from this. Can you tell us anything - any insights you acquired in taking the suits off and looking at the connector or just, in general, about what this problem may have been caused by? [Pause.]
Well, I guess - I guess our first indication was lack of a good integrity check. As a matter of fact, we couldn't get much more than about a pound in the suit. And the first - In thinking it over, we - we thought the only thing it could be would be those connectors, because that was the on - only semi-open port, even though it shouldn't - shouldn't be leaking. And, everybody checked their helmet and gloves and they appeared to be locked, so we broke open the helmet and gloves and Jim reached in through my zipper and pulled out the LCG connector and stuck in the plug. And then we rezipped, or I did. Jim rezipped me. And we tried another integrity check, and it worked okay. I guess beyond that - I don't have any explanation for it, other than the only possibility is that the LCG connector was leaking, or that somebody's glove or helmet was leaking, because the suits have been, as you know, very tight all the way through.
Roger. Did Jim notice when you - when Jim took out your connector there, to put the plug in, did he notice it as being loose, unattached, or not lock-locked? Did he have any - could he tell any of that just reaching in with his fingers? [Pause.]
Bob, this is Jim. The lock-lock was engaged on that water connector on Dave's suit.
Okay, copy. And do we understand that Dave's suit was the only one that did not pass the integrity check that first time around?
No. You can't isolate it. The whole suit circuit is the integrity check. It's spacecraft plus three suits. So, there's no way to tell.
Roger. But on - what I mean is that you did not put - did you put plugs in Jim's suit, too, or just in Dave's suit?
No, only - only in one suit. But we did go through the operation of taking off helmets and gloves, which also may have been the problem.
Roger. Copy that.
In - in other words, there may have - even though we checked the lock-locks on the helmets and gloves, why, somebody could have had a cocked one and - and missed it. These - es - especially the - the surface equipment was - had an - an awful lot of lunar dust on it, and it's sort of hard to work. We're - we're going to get them cleaned up before the EVA, but after three runs down there, why, the connectors were getting pretty tough to work, even though we did lubricate them.
Roger. Copy. I don't think we have anything else, Dave. We noticed you did seem to have some trouble getting a suit integrity check the second time around, also. Is that right?
Yeah. There was a glove that wasn't locked.
Okay, guess I wasn't on the loop. Thanks. [Long pause.]
I think the suit circuit's tight. I think that just might have just been one of those things, because the last one we ran was real good. It - the flow dropped down to like 6 or 7 tenths, I guess, and it would have stayed there all day long. I think we've got a good suit loop, but - I'm not worried about that at all. Just a matter of getting all the connectors cleaned up so they all work well, and ensuring that everybody gets a good lock-lock.
Rog, Dave. We agree too. I - it seems to us that that sounds like it was just one of those situations we run a suit integrity check for.
Rog. That's exactly right.
And, 15; Houston. You're Go for LOS. [Pause.]
Thank you very much, Houston.
Endeavour, this is Houston. Over. [Pause.]
Hello, Houston; this is Endeavour.
Rog. We got the usual Flight Plan updates, if you'll get a Flight Plan out and copy them in, please. [Pause.]
Okay; stand by one.
Okay; and if someone could give us High Gain Antenna to Auto, we'd appreciate it. [Long pause.]
Go ahead with the update.
Okay. First one is the UV photo plan at - PAD at 201:05 in the Flight Plan. The T-start for that will be 201:11:19. Over.
Understand. UV T-start 201:11:19.
Roger. Next, at 201:20, we will delete "PCM cable." [Pause.]
Okay; got that.
Roger. At 202:30, it's Discriminator, Low, in that line on the Mass Spec. [Pause.]
Okay. Discriminator, Low, at 202:30.
Roger. At 203:21, we will delete "Laser Altimeter, Off." [Pause.]
Understand. Delete "Laser Altimeter, Off" at 203:21, and let's hold up on the rest for now. [Long pause.]
And 15, 30 seconds to Pan Camera, Mono. [Long pause.]
Hey, go with the rest of the updates, Bob.
Okay. At 203:23, we'll delete the "Mapping Camera Track, Retract, talkback barber pole, 4 minutes, gray then Off, center;" that whole line. [Long pause.]
Okay; that's deleted. Next. [Pause.]
And we want Pan Camera, Mono, please. [Pause.]
It's there.
Roger; sorry.
Okay; 203:27, we'll delete "Mapping Camera/Laser Experiment, Covers, Closed, talkback barber pole, grey then Off, center;" et cetera. That whole line there. 203:27. [Pause.]
Okay. Next?
Okay; now we have here a little test the guys down here would like to run with the Laser [Altimeter] to see if we can zap it a little bit and rejuvenate it, perhaps. The first step is back on 201:30. We will delete the "Laser Altimeter, Off" and "Mapping Cover/Laser Altimeter Cover, Close." At 201 plus 30. Over. [Pause.]
Are you making an update to the update?
Stand by here. Stand by a minute.
Okay; I didn't exactly find that one.
Yeah, stand by. I got to check with OSO.
Okay, 15. We got a clarification on that. The "Laser Altimeter, Off" is at 201:30. The "Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover, Close" is called out at 201:32. And we want to delete both of those.
Stand by, Bob. We're taking pictures. We'll come back to you.
Yeah, give me a call. [Long pause.]
And 30 seconds to Pan Camera, Stereo.
Okay, Houston; 15. Go ahead with some updates, if you've got them.
Okay, Al. Did you copy? What we're doing is we're changing that update, deleting the Laser Altimeter, Off at 201:30. And then, we're also deleting at 201:32, the callout to "Close the Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover." Over. [Pause.]
Okay; I understand. At 201:30, you want the Laser Altimeter left On, and the Mapping Camera left out and the Covers, Open.
That's affirm. Okay; now after the Mapping...
Is that what you want?
That's affirm. And now, after the Mapping Camera is Off at 201:30, we want to cycle the Laser switch Off for 1 second, then On for 15 seconds, Off for 1 second, On for 15 seconds, et cetera, for 20 cycles. And after 20 cycles, we will leave the Laser Altimeter, On, for MSFN analysis. Over. [Long pause.]
Okay; understand. You want at 201:30 - you want to cycle the Laser Altimeter, Off for 1 second and On 15 seconds, for 20 seconds [correcting himself] for 20 cycles, and then leave it turned on.
That's a Roger, and we'll get back to you at that point. [Pause.]
Okay. [Pause.]
And that's all we have for right now, Al. [Pause.]
Roger.
And, Al, 30 seconds to Pan Camera, Standby, Power, Off.
And, 15, we verify the Pan Camera lens is stowed. When convenient, we'd like Battery B Charge - Battery Bravo Charge terminated.
Understand, B terminated.
And, Endeavour; Houston. One more request, please.
Go ahead, Bob.
Rog. Since we don't have the PCM cable, we'd like to, for these UV photos, to have you give us a mark each time you press the shutter button, please, on the air-to-ground.
Okay; if you'd like. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15.
Go ahead. [Pause.] Go ahead, 15.
Okay, Bob. Would you like me to hook up the PCM cable to it?
Well, the word that I was given down here was that you couldn't reach with the PCM cable.
No, we're taking - we're taking the pictures out of window 5, and that's where the scientific instrument outlet is.
Stand by. [Pause.] 15, if you can do that, that's fine.
Okay; I'll tell you what, Bob. I'll go ahead and hook up the PCM cable, and - and you tell me if you're getting a signal down there after I start taking pictures.
Okay. [Pause.]
And the word you got on it was - was correct. It looks like window 5's about the only window that can be used for the PCM cable.
Roger.
And, Endeavour, we won't be able to see that PCM real time, but we'll just assume that it's coming down if you've got the PCM cable hooked up.
Okay, Bob. I got it hooked up. [Long pause.]
30 seconds to UV photos.
Okay; thank you.
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Okay, Bob. When we took the - the shade out of window 5, window 5 still appears very clean.
Copy. [Long pause.]
And, Endeavour, two questions if you've got a chance, between now and the terminator photos.
Say again on the terminator photos, Bob.
Rog. Do you have time for a couple of questions, between now and the start of the terminator photos.
Yes, sure. Go ahead.
Roger. First, any comments on the Mass Spec. boom retraction you did a half hour ago.
No, no comments on it. And - I guess we're back to the position we were in before, that the thing is sort of half barber pole. And when I go back out with it - fiddle with it a little bit, the barber pole goes full up and then comes down about halfway again.
Okay; we copy.
And that's where it stands right now.
Okay. Second question...
I played with it for a while, and then got busy in other things. But I'll continue - I'll continue working on it.
Copy, Al. Second question, do you want me to continue giving the - you these real time marks on air - air-to-ground, just before and after various camera passes? [Pause.]
Yeah, I like the reminder, Bob.
Okay; 30 seconds...
Don't expect an answer, I'll probably be busy doing it.
Hopefully. 30 seconds a good time?
Rog. [Long pause.]
And, Houston; 15.
Go ahead. [Pause.] 15, go ahead.
Okay; for your info, the Mass Spec. took about - oh, maybe 7 or 8 cycles this time, before it came all the way in. And the same operation as before.
Roger; copy. It took you 7 or 8 cycles to get it all the way in.
30 seconds [to] the terminator photo start.
Terminator photos stop.
Rog, Bob.
Mapping Camera, Off.
And, Endeavour; Houston. Be advised, we like an accurate 15 seconds, On; 1 second, Off. No more than 16 or 17 seconds, On.
Roger; understand.
And, 15. Roger; thank you. Unfortunately, like everything else, the Laser didn't do much good. We'd like now, Mapping Camera to Standby; Laser Altimeter, Off. Then we'll do the Retract and Door Close. Over.
Okay, Bob. We'll go Mapping Camera, Off and Laser, Off.
We need Mapping Camera, Standby, please.
Roger; Standby, and Image Motion, Off, and Laser Altimeter, Off. And retracting the - retracting the camera now.
Copy.
Boy, that's ...
We didn't put it in my safe place.
Are you at P51?
I'm not there yet. See, I cleaned that thing religiously, all - every night?
No...
But we didn't...
...
But - but we didn't get it last night, I don't think.
No, it's all that crap we brought in here.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Feel the difference already in air that's blowing out of the hose. It really does make a difference. Yes.
I thought it was practically suffocating.
Probably that, and the combination of going in dark.
Oh, gosh. They're sitting there in their own comfortable console.
...
...
Yes, that's right.
And, Endeavour; Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, Al. If you could get us a film budget status on the backside to give us when you come around, we'd appreciate it. And except for that, you're Go for LOS.
All righty. Thank you, sir. And we'll see if we can conjure one up for you.
Good enough.
...? Yes, I need to get him a status of the Command Module. Joe - we'll give it to him when we come around next time.
That's the stuff ...
You tell me when - You tell me when ... that flight data ...
What's you doing? What's you doing? Throwing away dirty stuff? ...
...
...You didn't put on clean tonight, did you?
...
Oh. Your last one? Guess you got stuck with it, Jim. ...
(Laughter) I've got a little job for you to do, Jim. Assemble camera, lens, mirror, and magazine on special window-5 bracket; rotate the lens 180, so we can take pictures of the mass spec. You do that in - about 15, 20 minutes. Well, we use the - we use the 16 millimeter. And the bracket's down in A-8. You know, that big bracket down there. You do that while I'm...
I don't see it.
...while I'm doing a P52. Oops! Excuse me, Dave. ...
...
Yes, I know. God dang, it's not very crowded down here!
Hey, you got to this ...
Okay. We'll - we'll get it. I'll get it. Keep going. I'll get it.
...
I used to do it by myself. No big deal.
Okay, as long as you're in the couch, how about putting me in Free? Mode to Free.
Okay.
Star 1.
Star 40.
Where?
Out there.
Wooo!
...
...
Huh?
...
Let's see. ... 202:00:30.
Jim wants to know if his camera ... on the mass spec stuff.
Jim, you want to get the - the mass spec boom and gamma ray boom on their way out now? Might as well go ahead and do that.
Mass Spec Boom, Deploy. ... find it?
No, just get it out.
Do you want to...
We got time for it.
...
Yes. Okay, mass spec boom photography, 16 millimeter - Mag L. What mag's on there? E is on there now?
...
Here, you've got to put this UV thing in the window, too.
I'll have to go back.
Okay. I took all this - extra film and ...
... You got plenty of places in here, right?
Yes.
... remember ...
Okay.
You'll never get it all used up if you ...
That's right. We'll never have time to use it all.
...
Yes. Is there any further use for the vacuum cleaner and all this...
...
...stuff hanging around here?
... Put the bag and brush in ...
Okay.
...
Yes.
...
You've got to use it for ...
What have you got in there now?
Where did you...
...
...where'd you leave the filter and all that stuff?
...
Okay. Might as well leave it all there, huh?
I think before activities get too far away, I will take a crap.
Is that so?
Yes. Jim, will you unplug me, please? You guys got the comm.
...?
Yes.
And, Endeavour; Houston. Over. [Pause.]
Houston, Endeavour, go.
Roger, if you - Roger, if you guys give us an Accept, we'll send you up a state vector and time uplink. [Pause.]
Roger, you've got it.
Copy. [Pause.] And if you fellows will give me a call in the middle of your eating there, when you got time, we'll do some talking at you.
Okay, give us about five minutes here.
Okay.
And 15, its your computer. Over. [Pause.]
Rog. [Long pause.]
Houston, Endeavour. We're ready to chitty-chat, if you like.
Okay. While you guys are eating your supper there, it might be a good time to get a report on your food so far. How's it been going?
Oh, I think we have consumed every meal as planned and we've made a pretty good cut into the pantry.
You've made a pretty good cut into the pantry, you say?
Rog. That extra little box over there with extra little goodies.
Okay, and can you guys give us any estimates on the water that you and Jim consumed on the surface, say in the LM and on the EVA, and any differences between this and what Al's been consuming? [Pause.]
Not without sitting down and doing some thinking about it. We'd be glad to do that, if you like.
Roger. If that's not too much trouble, I guess we could start out by some estimate as to how much you guys were drinking in the LM and on the EVA. Was the drink bag adequate, or what?
Oh, I think that's probably a good discussion for the debriefing after the flight. [Pause.]
Okay. Sounds like you are at least eating and drinking a lot so far. We are anxious for you all to continue eating and drinking well, because of the EVA yet to come.
Oh, okay. Well if that's your - your interest, yes, we - we consumed quite a bit of water on the surface, and we were quite satisfied with what we had. We had plenty. And we've been eating and drinking a lot up here. I think everybody is in fine shape and ready to take care of what's on - on the Flight Plan the rest of the way.
Sounds good. One other specific point we'd like to clear up, Dave, which I guess was a little muddled this morning. Did you and Jim take a Seconal last night or not?
No, there's been no medication taken by anybody on the flight.
Okay. However, I - we down here would like to recommend for all three of you to take one tonight just to make sure we get another good night's sleep.
I think that's unnecessary.
Well, that's our recommendation anyway. And can you tell us who plans to sensor up tonight, Dave.
Okay. Rog. I guess as per our agreement this morning, why - you'll get CMP and a LMP tonight.
Roger; understand. And then we'll press on with the normal Flight Plan tomorrow. [Pause.] And, Al, we'd like to have you - you wear the lightweight headset tonight, because then, we'd like to wake just Al up on schedule so he can do us a P20 to - give us some plus-X time on the Mass Spec. And so we'd like to - arrange it that way, if its convenient with you guys.
No, I don't think that's practical, Bob. You can't have one person awake in here and the other two sleeping. It - just can't do it.
Okay; understand. And to avoid what we had last night with all those last minute calls again and again and again, why don't you guys give us a final call just before you're ready to go to sleep. We'll get a final status down here, and then we won't - we won't have to keep calling back tonight.
Oh, that's a good idea. All right. We'll do that.
It got a little embarrassing down here after a while. [Pause.]
Oh, that's okay. Yesterday was a long day.
Roger that. And we got a TEI-69 PAD down here, when Jim's ready to copy. And we're also ready to copy some torquing angles from that P52, if you got them. And we'd like you to leave your High Gain Antenna at plus 25 and 185 on Yaw and in Narrow and Reacquire as you go around the corner this time.
Oh, okay. You want Narrow, Reacquire and plus 25 and 185. We'll do that. If you're ready to copy, I've got the P52.
Roger. I'll copy that now.
Okay. Noun 05 was .01; Noun 93 was plus .07, minus .47, minus .05. They were torqued out at 202:00:30.
Roger. Copy .01, plus .07, minus .47, minus .05, and 202:00:30.
Rog. That's cricket. [Pause.]
And, Dave, we'd like Optic, Zero, at this time, please.
Oh, yes, Optic, Zero. Hey, by the way, I - I should have said .007. Pardon me. I had my decimal point in the wrong spot.
Understand .007. And was the...
Just - just put a zero in front of all - the three torquing numbers. The - the platform is too good and the numbers are so small we - we're not even thinking in three digits anymore.
Okay. We've got 007, 047, and 005. Understand.
That's correct. [Long pause.]
Okay, Bob. I'm ready to copy the PAD.
Okay, Jim. It's TEI-69, SPS/G&N; plus 36245; plus 0.61, plus 0.92; 213:51:51.04; plus 2803.1, minus 0465.4, minus 0099.6; 179, 132, 353. The rest of the PAD is NA. Ullage; 4 jets, 12 seconds. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. Readback for TEI is SPS/G&N...
You read me better? Bob, are you reading me okay?
You've got a loud squeal there, Jim, but I can probably read you. [Pause.]
Okay, Bob. Here's the readback. SPS/G&N; 36245; plus 0.61, plus 0.92; 213:51:51.04; plus 2803.1, minus 0465.4, minus 0099.6; 179, 132, 353; 4 jets for 12 seconds. Over.
Roger, Jim; copy. Good readback. [Pause.] And, Endeavour, that's all we've got for you right now, until you give us a presleep call, except for standing by for a film budget report from Al. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15.
Go. Go, 15.
Okay, Bob. I've got that film thing compiled for you, if you want to copy.
Copying.
Okay. I will read you frames expended. Magazine Nectar 76, Oscar 58, Romeo 55, Victor 12. And I haven't used anything out of S, and L is running right now on the Mass Spec.
Roger; copy. 76, 58, 55 and 12. [Pause.] Thank you guys. Give us a call when you're ready for sleep and we'll tuck you in.
Okay, Bobby. Love to have you do that.
And, Endeavour; Houston. We'd like Pan Camera, Standby. [Pause.]
Okay, Bob. Roger on the Standby. [Long pause.]
Houston, the Pan Camera was on Standby.
Say again, 15. [Pause.]
I say - the Pan Camera already was in Standby.
Okay. We'll have them check again. [Long pause.]
Okay, Dave. What we'd like is Power, On, also Pan Camera Power, On, for 5 minutes.
Okay. Power, On.
And, Endeavour; this is Houston. We can go Pan Camera Power, Off, now.
Roger. Power, Off, now.
Thank you.
Houston, Endeavour. Did you get the E-Mod dump?
Stand by.
Endeavour, Houston. It's not clear that we got it the first time. Why don't you give us another E-Mod dump again, please? [Pause.]
Okay. Coming down.
Thank you.
And, Endeavour; Houston. We [garble] at the LOS in about 2 minutes. Everything looks in configuration for sleep. We'd like to verify the Oxygen Heaters are Auto, Auto, Off. Except for that, you are Go for sleep and Go for LOS.
Okay; understand. And we're fixing to give you the presleep checklist, there. And we have a little unscheduled maintenance on our friendly water valve again. So we'll be about 10 more minutes, but it's under control. Same - same problem we had before.
Rog. And understand it's under control.
Yeah, it's just - just the same thing worked loose again, and we're cinching it down.
Roger. We copy. You guys didn't strike a coral reef there, did you?
[Laughter] No, I don't think so. [Long pause.]
Okay. O2 hea - O2 - O2 heaters are going to Auto, Auto, Off.
Roger. Auto, Auto, Off.
Rog.
