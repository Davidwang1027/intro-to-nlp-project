Endeavour, Houston. We're going to recommend you skip your P52. GUIDO's satisfied with your alignment, and we're ready with your Circ. burn - Circ. PAD any time. [Pause.]
Roger, Houston; Endeavour. Stand by one. [Pause.]
Endeavour, Houston. Did you say standing by? [Pause.]
Yeah, Houston, Endeavour's ready to copy.
Okay, Al. We'd like for you to go ahead and start going to the burn attitude. I'll give you the roll, pitch, and yaw, and you can get that in, and I - then I will give you the rest of the PAD. [Pause.]
Roger, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. 000, 107, 358. [Pause.]
Rog; understand. 000, 107, 358. I'll put that in and be right back with you.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston; Endeavour. We're maneuvering. Go ahead with the rest of the PAD.
Okay. Circ.: SPS/G&N; 37679; plus 0.49, plus 1.04; GET is 101:38:58.19; plus 0068.3, minus four zeroes 1, minus four zeroes 7; 000, 107, 358; 0064.9, plus 0054.3; 0068.3, 0:04, 0057.2; sextant star 10, 171.3, 40.0. The rest NA. GDC Align, Vega, Deneb; 288, 340, 346. Ullage four jet, 14 seconds. [Long pause.]
Roger, Houston. Understand. P30 PAD, Circ. burn, SPS/G&N; 37679; plus 0.49, plus 1.04; 101:38:58.19; plus 0068.3, minus 0000.1, minus 0000.7; 000, 107, 358; 0064.9, plus 0054.3; 0068.3, 0:04, 0057.2; 10, 171.3, 40.0. Vega, Deneb, set stars; 288, 340, 346. Four jet, 14 seconds.
That's a good readback, Al, and I have an erasable change for you. [Pause.]
Okay, Go ahead.
Verb 21, Noun 01. Address 1765 and Enter 01605. [Pause.]
Understand. Verb 21, Noun 1, Enter, 1765, Enter, 01605, Enter.
That's affirmative, and that's - a short burn constant change, Al.
Rog. [Long pause.]
And, Al. Be advised that your sextant star will be occulted at 101:16 - 7 minutes from now. And a gentle reminder, this is a single bank, bank B burn.
Rog.
Okay. PDI zero PAD, when both vehicles are ready. [Pause.]
Falcon's ready. [Pause.]
Roger, Falcon. And did you get the Circ. GTI [means TIG]?
Affirmative, Ed.
Okay. And, Endeavour, you're ready for a PDI zero PAD?
Endeavour's ready.
Okay. PDI zero. Alpha: 102:39:35.35; Bravo: plus 0100.0, plus all zeros, plus 0001.8; 0138.3, plus 0009.0, 0100.1; 0:34; 000, 273; 0159.6; plus 0100.0, plus all zeros, plus 0002.4; Cocoa: 103:40:24.00; Delta: 105:22:30.00. Readback. [Pause.]
Okay. Houston, this is Falcon with PDI zero readback. 102:39:35.35; plus 0100.0, plus all zips, plus 0001.8; 0138.3, plus 0009.0, 0100.1; 0:34; 000, 273; 0159.6; plus 0100.0, plus all zips, plus 0002.4; 103:40:24.00, 105:22:30.00. Over.
Good readback, Falcon. And, Al, did you copy?
Endeavour copied.
Roger, Roger.
Okay, Houston. We'll talk in a minute.
And, Falcon; Houston. We copy. Thank you.
And, Endeavour; Houston. You're Go for Circ. as soon as you get your short burn constant loaded.
Okay, Ed. [Long pause.]
And we observed it here. Endeavour.
Okay. [Pause.]
And, Falcon, Houston. AGS K-vector. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Houston. Ready to copy.
Roger. 100, 000, and 00006. [Pause.]
Roger. 100, 00, 0006.
I think we needed 00006.
Okay; understand. Four zeros 6.
That's affirm. [Long pause.]
Okay, Apollo 15, Houston. We're about 1 minute from LOS. We seem to be caught up [with the Flight Plan], and everything is looking good from here.
Falcon, Roger. Thank you.
And Endeavour, Roger. Thank you.
Al, we're going to Data.
Okay, Jim. Recorder's running.
Okay, nice recovery over there.
Think I'm minus at least one fingernail, though.
Oh, gad. Where did you lose it?
On - as a matter of fact, on A-1 when I went after the sextant adapter.
Oh, my!
[Laughter.] That's okay, just a little loose.
So long as you're not leaking.
I'm not, no. Okay, I'm all set up for the burn here, I've done P40, done the sextant star check, and everything's looking pretty good. And I've got 14 minutes to go.
Okay, very good. Oh, yes, I wanted to tell you a little bit about the landing site there - on the - on the craters. There's a - Earthlight Crater, of course, is a lot sharper than Index. And then there's a great big one to the east of Index, which is the same size and quite sharp, and I think - you won't have any trouble as long as you see the Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Index. Index is a pretty subtle crater, and there probably won't be much shadow in the bottom of it at all, when you get there.
Yes. Okay. I - I - I know where it is, I think, well enough in location so I can look for the - for the shallow depression.
Okay. Both of those will probably have shadow in them.
Yes.
But - gee, they're real super; you can't miss.
Falcon, Endeavour.
Go ahead, Al.
Okay, do you want the Noun 81 values for this burn now, or do you want to wait until after?
After.
Okay, I've gone through the primary gimbal check and turning on number 2 now.
Roger.
Gimbal drive check.
[Garble] we feel like we're right there with you.
All looks normal.
Good show.
FDAI scale 5/5. Rate, High, and looks like we're going.
Good.
Everything checks fine; 2 minutes and 12 seconds.
Okay.
Okay. Delta-V Thrust B is On. And B Pilot Valve is closed.
Okay.
One minute.
Right with you on the time.
Average g.
Roger.
Ullage.
Thank you.
Thrust, On.
Thrust, Off. What a kick in the tail!
Didn't I tell you?
You did! Had to see it for myself.
That's great, isn't it?
Fantastic, man; you really move!
Yes, man. That's like really flying, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
Did you get it all in, Al?
Sure did, Dave. Right down to the gnat.
Very good.
Sorry about that. I had - only had 9/10ths residual in X and I - I trimmed it out. That short burn constant made it a lot better.
Good.
And I'm in a 65.2 by 54.8.
65.2, 54.8. Okay.
How about that! We have you in a 65.2 by 54.6.
Super.
Al, how do you read now?
I read you 5 square, Dave.
Okay. We had an antenna change called here and sounds like you're pretty good, so we'll just stay with you this way.
Okay.
Now.
