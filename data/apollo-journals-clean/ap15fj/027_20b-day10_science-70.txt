15, this is Houston. How do you read?
Houston, 15. Loud and clear.
Roger, 15. We're reading you loud and clear. We have Flight Plan updates available any time you're interested in copying it.
Okay. Stand by one.
Okay, Houston. Go ahead with your updates.
Roger, Dave. We'd like to have you start the battery A charge first.
Roger. We're just doing it right now.
Okay. Flight Plan updates; 214 plus 41. The - we delete the Pan...
Go ahead.
we delete several lines there. "Pan Camera Mode, Standby; Power, On; Stereo; Exposure, Normal;" and "Pan Camera Mode to Operate", all deleted.
Rog; understand. Three lines deleted. Deleted at 214:41. Go.
Rog. At 214 plus 50, we delete "Pan Camera Mode, Standby" and "MSFN veri; verify lens tuck in".
Roger; 214:50; delete 2 lines. Go ahead.
Roger. At 214:53, delete "Pan Camera Power, Off", and at 55 delete "Gamma-ray Boom, Deploy".
Rog. At 53 and 55, delete one line each. Go.
At 215:17, we add "Map Camera, On, switch Off, parenthesis T-stop; Laser Altimeter, Off; Map Camera, On, Standby, T-stop plus 30 seconds. Map Camera, Image Motion, Off".
Stop - break - break, Karl. Try it again - a little slower so I can write it.
Roger; 215 plus 17. First line, "Map Camera, On, Off, parenthesis T-stop". Second line, "Laser Altimeter, Off". Third line, "Mapping Camera, On to Standby, T-stop plus 30 - 30 seconds". Fourth line, "Mapping Camera, Image Motion, Off".
Okay. Copy. At 215:17, "Map Camera, On to Off, T-stop; Laser Altimeter, Off; Map Camera, On to Standby at T-stop plus 30 seconds" and "Map Camera, Image Motion to Off".
Roger. At 215 plus 19, add "Gamma-ray Boom, Deploy".
Okay. 215:19; "Gamma-ray Boom, Deploy". Go.
215 plus 25, delete "Laser Altimeter, Off".
Rog. 215:15, delete "Laser Altimeter, Off". Go.
Over at 216:01, "Laser Altimeter, On", is moved down to 216 plus 15.
Okay. 216:01 "Laser Altimeter, On", deleted; at 216:15 "Laser Altimeter, On" added. Go ahead.
Correct. 217 plus 14, add "Laser Altimeter to Off".
Okay. 217:14, "Laser Altimeter, Off". Go.
At 217 plus 20, we delete - three lines. "Mapping Camera, Image Motion", "Mapping Camera, On", and "Mapping Camera, Image Motion" - steps, all three.
Okay; 217:21 delete three lines. Got 'em. Go ahead.
Right. And, in that place at 217:20, put the line down below at 217:25 "Gamma-ray Boom, Deploy".
Okay. At 217:20, we should have "Gamma-ray Boom, Deploy" vice 217:25.
Roger. At 218:02, we change the camera configuration there. We're going to use window 5, CM-5. We need the 80-millimeter lens - 80-millimeter lens, and the setting should be stop 2.8, exposure time 1 over 250.
Okay. 218:02, use CM-5/EL/80-millimeter, 2.8, 1/250th. Go.
And the note there is - use the Lex - use the Lexan shield on CM-5; in other words, leave it on the window.
Okay. Lexan shield. Got it.
At 218:10, delete "Mapping Camera, Image Motion, Increase".
Okay. One line deleted at 218:10. Go.
At 218 plus 14, we add "Laser Altimeter, On". We have four lines here. "Mapping Camera, Image Motion, On; Mapping Camera, On to On at T-start; Mapping Camera, Image Motion, Increase; talkback barberpole plus 4/On".
Okay. 218:14 "Laser Altimeter, On; Mapping Camera, Image Motion to On; Mapping Camera, On to On at T-start; and Mapping Camera, Image Motion, Increase; and talkback barber pole plus 4 seconds/On".
Roger. At 220 plus 07, we add "Pan Camera Mode, Standby; Power On". And that will be "Mono and Exposure, Normal".
Okay. 220:07 "Pan Camera to Standby; Power, On; Mono; Exposure, Normal". Go.
At 220 plus 13, we add "Pan Camera Mode, Operate at T-start".
220:13, "Pan Camera to Operate at T-start".
Roger. And about 220:18, expect the talkback showing you film depletion - the film finished. At that time, go Mode, Standby; and wait for a MSFN cue to go Power, Off.
And 15, we'd like to have High Gain, Auto.
Okay. 220:18, Pan Camera - 220:18, we should have film depletion; Pan Camera to barber pole, then go Standby and wait for MSFN cue for Power, Off. Go.
And that's the end of the update.
Okay. I guess when you run out of film, you run out of updates.
That's about the size of the situation.
15, Houston. If you are willing to listen, I have about a 3-minute update on the morning news.
Stand by one, Karl.
Okay, Houston; 15. We're ready for the news.
Roger, 15. The flight of Apollo 15 is still front page news around the world. Even yesterday's relatively quiet activities were noted by most news media. The rail strike with the United Transportation Union has ended, and ten railroads that were out of operation for 18 days are back on the tracks. Growers in California were hardest hit by the strike, losing an estimated 45 million dollars in sales and related industries. President Nixon has asked Congress not to allow the use of federal funds to pay for bussing school children. The administration also announced that it is appealing a bench mark court ruling against massive bussing in the public - in the public schools of Austin, Texas. Treasury Secretary John B. Connally is attempting to stop a rumored increase in bank interest rates. Connally said he's distressed to hear reports that bank prime lending rates are to be raised again. Rates were increased only last month. New York stock exchange prices fell yesterday in the second largest decline of the year, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping almost 15 points. Analysts say the decline may have been caused by the rumored increase in interest rates. You got up too early to hear much news of last night's baseball games but we can report that the Astros lost to the Cubs, 5 to nothing. They did better Monday night when they beat the Cubs 2 to 1. The weather report from the Houston area is one word: soggy. Rain has fallen off and on for more than 24 hours, and there was a long steady rain most of yesterday afternoon. Going to be a lot of grass cutting to do when you get back down here, guys.
Oh, yeah; but we sure got nice sunny weather up here.
No clouds up there, huh? That's amazing.
No. It's just as clear as crystal.
Thinking about all that sunshine up there reminds me that we're in a bind down here about your exposure to UV, and we recommend that, on the several times on the next couple of orbits when you're requested to take the - the Lexan cover off of window 5, that you alternate handling that photography to keep under the legal doses.
All right; we'll do that.
15, Houston. The doctors down here with their - with their electrocardiograms see that the CMP - or at least they think the CMP - is on the - the biomed apparatus; and, according to Flight Plan, they'd like to have the LMP on.
Okay. We thought we'd give you both since you were sort of interested in that yesterday.
Okay; that would be great.
15, Houston. We have a couple of camera PADs when you have time to copy.
Okay; stand by a couple of minutes, will you please, Karl?
Rog.
Okay, Karl. I'll copy those PADs for you.
Roger. They're in the Flight Plan at 216. The first one is the Solar Corona photo PAD. T-start is 216:03:55. Down below, the Mapping Camera photo PAD: Start 216:18:30, Stop 217:18:15.
Copied. 216:03:55, 216:18:30, and 217:18:5 - 15.
That's correct.
15, Houston. If you'll give us Accept, we'll send up a new state vector.
Roger.
15, Houston: the computer is yours.
Roger.
Hey Al. I've sort of got an itch to hear what the Aristarchus region looks like in daylight. You got any comments?
Well, I'll tell you, Karl; we've all been sitting here kind of looking at Aristarchus a little bit in awe. It looks like probably the most volcanic area that I've seen anywhere on the surface. And certainly it's just very covered with rilles, very - quite deep rilles, too, some of them. Schröter's Valley, for instance, is a magnificent big rille which looks like it's worked - been worked twice; of course, the large rille and then a smaller rille inside.
What about the source of Schröter's Valley?
Several cones - say again?
What about the source of Schröter's Valley. Does it look volcanic?
Well, that whole area in there looks volcanic, yeah. And that certainly comes from - from up on the plateau there. I would guess that the Cobra Head is the source for Schröter's Valley. The elevation is - is a little subtle from this - from this vantage point, but I - I guess that would be my guess. And as far as where the - think we've found something interesting anyway about the - the ends of the rilles, particularly around the Schröter's Valley area, it looks quite distinctly like the rilles - the - the mouths of the rilles - or the delta's have been covered with rising maria - mare materials - from the lower - from the - from the lower elevation. Almost as if there was a - a - a rille with a delta-like deposit at one time, but then the mare - the elevation of the mare - or the height of the mare came up into the rille far enough to - to cover all that delta area. So all you see now is what would look like a - a - a river into a lake who's elevation has increased.
Ah, ha! Very interesting thought.
15, this is Houston. I'm turning you over to Joe now. I'll see you on the way home tomorrow.
Okay, Karl. Talk to you tomorrow. Thanks for coming out so early for us.
It was a pleasure, believe me.
Good morning, Yankee Clipper; this is Houston.
Good morning, Endeavour; this is Houston.
Good morning, Houston; this is Endeavour. How are you today?
Just fine, Dave.
The devil in the backup commander made me do the other.
Oh, we're not surprised.
Seems like that other fellow is hung up on that other flight for some reason or another.
Endeavour, this is Houston. We're about 4 minutes from LOS. You look to be in good shape to go around the corner.
Rog. Thank you, Houston.
