[Garble] second burst, and we overburned just a bit.
Okay, I'm going to go down and [garble] up the SIM bay here.
Look at this [garble].
See where it says 2 5 [garble] 25 [garble].
Okay, let's see what it says here.
Okay.
You know what the [garble], don't you? [Garble].
What?
[Garble] seconds to go. Probably [garble] and [garble]. 10 seconds.
That's right. We did [garble] over.
Yes. We did - especially when [garble] getting [garble].
[Garble] I could - I could tell [garble] - not [garble] on.
Yes.
I thought about that, you know?
Yes. Yes.
It was just right after [garble].
I could - I could see your hand start to go. And I looked at the DSKY and looked up, and then I could see it was going to shut off. But I could see your hand - you were - you were waiting for it. I knew I wasn't going to be more than half a second after.
Yes. That - that's pretty close.
Yes.
But you could see it - I could see when (cleared throat) when it automatically shut down before I could [garble].
Oh, yes.
Well, you know the ball valve actually opened up [garble] like that [garble]. And I usually...
Yes.
...can't see that. I started to watch the [garble] PC started [garble].
[Garble] shut down [garble].
[Garble] I know what you mean...
[Garble].
Yes, I know. I keep telling them it's going to be ...
Oh yes. Right [garble] nothing like a [garble], wouldn't you say?
Yes. Okay. [Garble]. Verb [garble] get it in [garble].
All right. What do you want to do?
[Garble] a [garble]. [Garble]?
Yes. Yes. [Garble].
[Garble].
Yes. Oh, here comes [garble] That terminator is just like something out of the movies.
Yes. [Garble]...
I mean it's just a - just a strip all the way across.
Yes, boy.
Hold your breath on this one, Jim?
What in the hell would you [garble]?
Yes. Yes, but I wouldn't say it [garble].
Oh, [garble]. [Garble].
Huh?
Do you know what we have to do yet?
Yes. [Garble].
Gee. This is [garble]. We're not even down in the [garble].
[Laughter.]
Wait until we get down in the [garble], then we're [garble].
240,000 miles and [garble] [laughter].
What do you want?
[Laughter.]
[Garble] you know, but [garble]...
You want me to put you on the surface?
[Laughter.]
[Garble]...
Why don't you, Al? [Laughter.]
...[garble]
That's true [laughter].
[Garble]?
Yes, that's right [laughter].
[Garble]...
No. I want to be safe [laughter].
[Garble].
Yes, you're right, boy, you're right. [Garble].
[Garble]?
That's right.
Go on to sleep, Al.
[Garble].
[Garble] I think you're about ready for bed.
[Garble] P52.
No.
Yes. [Garble].
[Garble].
Let's see if we can't help Al a little bit.
Sure. Let's [garble].
No. [Garble].
If you're going to be operating this [garble] for 3 days, we ought to try and set up a system to square it away.
[Garble].
Yes. [Garble].
[Garble].
[Garble].
[Garble], [garble], and tomorrow night [garble], except most of those pictures would be in the open. [Garble] pictures of the lunar surface. I think it'll probably [garble] a couple of days [garble].
I think so, too.
[Garble] situation [garble], fill it up, and [garble].
Yes.
You really need to do that. You can't just [garble].
If you're at all worried about the Flight Plan, [garble].
Hey, that looks black. Wouldn't you say that's black?
I'd say it's a dark gray.
There's something up here that's dark gray?
Well, this looks like it's [garble].
Man, it already looks like we're lower. Whoo.
[Garble] looks black over there.
Hey, that's right. It looks real dark way down there.
[Garble].
They say then it looks like you're just going to dive.
It sure does.
[Garble] going at 50 feet per second.
Yes, siree-bob. Hey, look at that big mound over here, son of a gun. Hey, hey, check the mound [garble] over here.
Oh, yes?
That's Van De Graaff.
That's bigger than Van De Graaff.
The one right under us?
No, the one just out there at 11 o'clock.
Oh, yes.
The long - elongate one. That's Van De Graaff. And just out in the distance there, off to the left is - is the Mare Ingen-u-ity.
Oh, yes. [Garble] to the left?
That's [garble]. It's just as [garble].
[Garble] mountain's [garble], and the [garble] mountain's [garble].
Whoo-ho-ho! Oh, ho, no. [Laughter.]
He's already [garble]. Hey, what do we - what do we have to do?
Hold on a minute.
[Garble]?
Roger. We already look low, and we got 180 degrees to go, babe.
What time do we [garble]?
Another 25 minutes.
Holy cow.
Hey, you can [garble]. It's a great place to take a bunch of pictures of the - of the [garble] and all that. We ought to do that [garble].
Look at that [garble] down there, underneath us. About [garble]. [Garble] there.
[Garble].
Well, old buddy, I guess that's all very [garble].
Yes.
Is this [garble] rille that - or is this a rille?
What?
This [garble] flat piece we're coming up on.
No.
Hey, no, that's that rille I was talking about before.
Yes, Al.
Yes. This one [garble] here. [Garble] first time [garble]? Where is that crater?
We ought to get a picture of that [garble].
[Garble] reading?
[Garble] 08. It's close to Kepler.
It almost looks like it's a [garble] feature rather than a rille.
The one we're going over right now?
Yes.
Yes. Who's got the 80? Is it CMP?
I'm looking.
See out here at 10 o'clock, Dave?
Yes. I do.
That's the one we picked up on the map, we called [garble].
The rille?
Yes, because it just kind of - slopes on the inside; looks like most of the [garble] turns up even though there isn't any rille.
[Garble].
Okay, Al. Here's the - the 80.
I don't [garble]...
You'll get a much better picture from this attitude.
Is that right?
Just like a low-level flight.
[Garble] this is really [garble].
We must be [garble] here.
Oh, what's the [garble]? How much time we got before [garble]?
[Garble] showing 63 and 1 [garble].
[Garble] use the 250 or do you want to go to...
Let me get - let me get one here with the 250. [Garble].
[Garble], Dave?
[Garble].
Yes, sir! [Garble].
That was a [garble] continuous [garble].
[Garble] low.
[Garble].
You know, we are going [garble].
Look at that.
[Garble].
It's really [garble].
[Garble]...
Yes...
...[garble]
...[garble]
Yes.
Wouldn't that be something? [Garble] right over there [Garble].
[Garble].
Did you ever check those photo things for me, Jim?
Yes. [Garble]?
Quite sure. Yes. There should be two that were like that.
Just a minute here.
Well, you're looking for [garble].
Sea of Ingenuity?
Yes; 5.6 at a 250th.
Okay.
And then at Keyhole, you look [garble]. And The Bright One, you look to the left.
You know, I think this is [garble] down here. Look at [garble]...
[Garble].
...[garble] We'll get a couple of pictures here.
[Garble] though.
You got a roll in there?
Yes. P [garble].
[Garble].
You might say some of those craters are really ...
[Garble] navigation is a little more difficult down at this altitude.
Huh?
Navigation is more difficult at this altitude.
[Garble].
Low-level navigation.
Oh, I don't know.
Did you get yourself located?
[Garble] pretty well - set.
[Garble].
At least you can follow them, now that we're going forward.
You should be coming upon Gagarin [garble].
There's sure a good-sized one off to the north.
Well, Gagarin is very shallow, oval.
See that? Off to the north?
Have you see it yet? Jim apparently has the right idea.
Yes.
[Garble].
Well, it's in the right attitude. Can you see anyhing over there, Jim?
Yes. [Garble] all right.
It looks that way, but it sure is [garble].
Watch the TV.
Look for the [garble] one over on the left side.
Yes.
Should come over the horizon.
[Garble].
[Garble].
No, I [garble].
Yes. That is the central peak of Tsiolkovsky, I bet you 10 dollars.
Really?
Yes.
And that is...
[Garble]...
...sort of a big [garble].
[Garble] in the rim.
[Garble]?
Huh?
No.
Think there's [garble] in the [garble]?
Well, there's - Yes, there's parts of it that are very small, such as the peak.
But I guess it doesn't really strike home until you get down to something like this [garble].
Good idea. I'll [garble].
[Garble].
Oh, boy. I'll never sleep [garble] open.
No, that's a pretty good theory, though.
Yes, I want to - I want to wade through [garble] - go through this.
[Garble].
Yes. Yes, [garble].
Okay. We got two developing [garble] over there.
God damn, that's just like being on a poor bus!
[Laughter.] [Garble].
...
Hard enough?
Dark?
Yes.
[Garble]. Up on the ridge line.
I think that's shadows, isn't it?
I don't think that's shadow [garble].
[Garble] good idea. [Garble].
Yes.
Oops, over here [garble].
What the hell is it?
Two old compasses.
Oh, good grief [garble].
Oh, man. That sure is a great landmark.
Isn't it?
[Garble] supposed to do that, you know where we are.
Yes. Boy, you sure got a good attitude, Dave. It [garble].
Isn't it beautiful!
No, I couldn't - I couldn't have picked a better one myself.
I'm trying here to figure out where those two [garble] are.
They should be...
[Garble] - Look at that - that one right there. Right there.
[Garble].
Whoa.
Now look out.
Oh, yes. Hey, yes. That's Mount [garble].
Yes, yes.
[Garble]. Say, you can really see, can't you?
Light's on.
Why don't you take you some pictures?
Okay.
Let's see, we're right at [garble]. No, let's see. [Garble].
We're heading just a little bit to the ri - to the left of our Flight Plan.
What?
And maybe a few deg - around the curve, there.
Curve?
Yes, don't you...
You want to show me it?
Yes. My pleasure. Look. There it is. Look.
Maybe you should [garble] on the end there.
Oh, nothing.
[Garble]. Everyone says [garble] that you're not allowed to do it, but you have to do it if [garble].
Does it look like anything?
Yes.
[Garble].
Move the fans over,
Will the [garble]?
Yes.
Okay.
Hey, you guys really [garble].
Yes.
That's when you [garble]. You can feel it.
Yes.
[Garble] [coughing] [garble].
What?
[Garble] that long.
You going to be able to look at it through your sextant? Did you...
I'm not sure.
[Garble].
[Garble].
Yes, do you mean we got to go up through the [garble]?
If you're not going to make it?
No, I - I figured you'd rather do it.
No, it's up to you. You do whatever you'd like.
No. Oh, no, I'm not going [garble]...
Okay, very good.
[Garble]...
That's right.
[Garble] you got to give a [garble] that you'll get over it. You - you do everything you want to do.
[Garble].
[Laughter.]
I - If I'm in your way, just [garble] it down.
Oh, sure.
[Laughter.]
[Garble]...
You're too hard for him. You be easy on him, or he'll [garble]...
Oh, yes. Very good.
Where is [garble], by the way?
It's out in the middle of [garble].
Is it really?
Yes.
The same crater as we were [garble]?
Yes.
The same patterns as [garble] Crater?
As a matter of fact, I could have gone through [garble].
Why don't you do that?
Okay.
That'd give us an idea of [garble]. [Garble] what you're going to be looking at. [Garble] - you know you [garble].
Well, I tell you, it's not a very - it's not a very colorful crater.
[Garble], Jim. Did you see [garble] over there?
Yes.
It's sure going to be [garble] stick to the time line. Yes, that would.
One-half hour.
[Garble].
Hey, you [garble].
You got a [garble] space.
Yes; can't even see the horizon.
Yes.
[Garble] in the Orb-rate. [Garble] get back to the [garble].
[Garble] Verb 67.
[Garble] we can get to this [garble]. The - Can you move that thing?
Yes.
You really don't need [garble].
Yes.
Isn't that the truth? You really don't need it.
There it is.
[Garble].
Wait a minute. [Garble].
Yes, well, even that [garble]. That's why we had trouble finding anything at all that we could use, because there isn't anything.
Nothing to change it over here at all. Nothing to change it, Al, [garble] that we could use.
How about a - Let's see, what kind of [garble] we use. 25.958?
Uh-huh. And we've got [garble].
Yes, and you got [garble]. Five point [garble] here. [Garble].
[Garble].
[Garble] here. [Garble].
Huh?
[Garble] .3 [garble].
[Garble].
[Garble].
[Garble].
Yes.
There'd be a lot more.
Yes.
[Garble]. And - I'm going to push these back in.
[Garble] to be all set up with your G&C Checklist [garble] GDC Align.
[Garble].
[Garble].
[Garble].
[Garble].
Yes.
Got that.
I get that initial downhill impression. We're supposed to be [garble].
[Garble] did.
[Garble].
Darn it. Right there.
There it was, whatever it was.
Hum. [Garble].
Yes.
Good. [Garble].
Did you get this [garble] on, Jim?
Yes, but I never could tell [garble], when it went on.
Okay.
15, this is Houston.
Hello, Houston, Apollo 15. The Falcon is on its perch.
Good to hear you coming around that corner. How do things look?
Okay. Burn status report. Burn was on time. The burn time was about 24.0 - about half a second shorter than predicted. There was no trim; residuals were plus .6 [fps], plus .0, minus .1; Delta-VC, minus 4.4; fuel 29 - 29.25 [per cent of full]; and the oxidizer was 29.55; unbalance, 100 increase. [Pause.]
Thank you, Dave. We copy all that. [Pause.]
And I'll tell you, it's really spectacular, when you can see the central peak of Tsiolkovsky coming up over the horizon before you see the rim.
Hey, that's an interesting astrophysical observation.
And, Houston, 15. The G&N [Guidance and Navigation computer] had us in a 58.4 by 10.0 [nautical mile, 108.2 by 18.5 km orbit].
We copy, 15.
Houston, 15. We're in an attitude now in which we cannot see the surface. But our initial impressions after the burn, when we could see the surface, is that we were rolling in on a high-angle pass.
We copy, 15. [Pause.]
And, Al just added, we were.
True enough. True enough. [Long pause.]
15, this is Houston. You're Stay in the DOI orbit, and we have an orbit for you of 58.8 by 9.5 [nautical miles, 108.9 by 17.6 km].
Very good, Houston. 58.8 - 9.5 and we're Stay. Thank you. [Long pause.]
15. You have a Go to proceed to the landmark observation attitude.
Roger, Houston. Thank you.
And would you please give us Auto on the High Gain [Antenna]?
Auto.
Okay, Houston, 15. We've got a little bit of visual - visibility now, and we're down in Crisium. [Pause.]
Roger, 15. [Long pause.]
And it looks like we have enough altitude to get up over the [mountains on the] western rim!
You know, I sure hope so. [Long pause.]
But it sure looks like we're looking up at some of those fellows [the mountains] down there.
That must be sort of exciting, skimming along down there over the waves.
That's a mild word for it. [Pause.]
Hey, can you see anything more about those sw - swirls? Anything...
I think I...
...interesting?
No, we're too close. And right now I've just finally picked out the rim of Proclus, and we're just about level, altitude-wise, with the - the rim of Proclus. I cannot see down into it. I can see just a tad of the southern wall. I guess we're just north of it. I can see some large blocks on the outer walls.
Roger.
But I'd say we're definitely at an altitude even with the top of the rim of Proclus.
Okay, Houston, we're coming up on the edge of Serenitatis now and I can look out and see a rille that runs parallel with the eastern edge. We're taking some pictures.
Roger, I suspect that's Littrow Rille. [Long pause.]
And after Littrow Rille, you should be coming up on le Monnier. Do you have much chance of seeing down at that angle? [Pause.]
I doubt it, Karl. At this attitude for the landmark tracking, the windows are almost out of it. Jim's got some visibility out window 5.
Karl, we just passed the wrinkle ridges about a quarter of the way across Serenitatis, and the - there is a - definitely a topographic high in the middle of the wrinkled portions. [Pause.]
Roger, 15, we copy. [Pause.]
Are those ridges smooth, or do they show signs of lots of cracks in them?
I was impressed with the smoothness of the - the raised portion.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay. I'm taking several pictures of the wrinkled ridges that run roughly north and south in Serenitatis.
Excellent, Jim.
In the one we just passed over, there were some vertical fractures, definite vertical relief, in the smooth portion of the raised wrinkled ridge. The fractures were also running north and south.
Roger, Jim. We copy. [Long pause.]
Karl, just a spectacular view as we glide across the Sea of Serenity, and I'm taking a picture now of a sinuous rille out to the north.
Roger, Jim.
Okay. We're approaching the mountains now on the western side of Serenitatis. At this point, there's a wrinkle ridge running to the - the northwest. [Pause.]
Karl, this is Al.
Go ahead Al.
Okay, Karl. I just finished the observation on J-1, and everything looked fine from my standpoint. [I] could track it very smoothly. And in fact, I took a couple of marks on it, if anyone's interested.
Very good, and we have them down here.
Okay. [Pause.]
We were sitting down here wondering how you were ever going to find that little bugger. No trouble, huh? [Pause.]
Not that much trouble, Karl.
Very good.
Seemed like there was plenty of time waiting on it. [Long pause.]
15, does it look like you are going to clear the mountain range ahead?
Karl, we've all got our eyes closed. We're pulling our feet up.
Open your eyes. That's like going to the Grand Canyon and not looking.
15, This is Houston. I have the camera photo PADs.
Okay, stand by. We're just noticing the cabin temp here, and also that the outlet temp is up to about - the glycol about - outlet temp's up to about 70[° Fahrenheit]. [Long pause.]
We copy, and EECOM says that's normal and they're on their way down now.
Okay, fine. Thank you.
And, Karl, I'm ready to copy the - the Map Camera PAD.
Roger. They're in the Flight Plan at 84:32 and 84:39. Mapping Camera: T-start, 84:42:23; T-stop 84:54:14. The Pan Camera times are the same as the Mapping Camera's times and we would like to change a shutter speed at 84:24. Instead of 125th, we want 1/250th at 84:24.
Okay. Understand 84:24. We'll change to F 250 [means 1/250] rather than 125; and on the Map PAD, it's 84:42:23 and 84:54:14, and the Pan Camera PAD's the same.
That's all correct.
15, we have your torquing angles.
Okay. Laser Altimeter, On.
Yes.
Mark.
Okay, let me talk to Karl here for a minute.
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Okay, Karl. Got a few numbers for you on the [boom] extension times. We started the whole thing off at 84:06:30, and got the covers open, the Mapping Camera extended, and the extension was about 3 minutes instead of 4. Then we deployed the Gamma-ray and the Mass Spec. booms for barber pole plus 2 seconds [to release the tiedowns]. The Gamma-ray turned barber pole after 6 seconds, and Mass Spec. turned barber pole immediately. And I was suspicious of the Mass Spec., so we tried it again and got the same results. Turned the X-ray, On, at 84:15:10 and the Laser Altimeter, On, at 84:15:30.
Roger, Al. We copy.
Looks like that stuff's working fine. Tch, tch.
Great! Super!
Good enough.
That's it. Verify DSE tape motion at 84:20, and then we get the cameras ready for terminator photos.
That a boy!
Pan camera, we go - we already got our terminator photos. Did you get - Let's see, we want mag R. That's this mag here.
With the Hasselblad? You got the Hasselblad over there?
Yes. And, let's see, we want the Hasselblad 80 millimeter, intervalometer--
Let's see, intervalometer's down there, Jim, in the - Let's see - It's in the camera - It's right in front of the camera compartment.
Oh, boy.
It's right there; that's it.
Okay. What do you want to do now, get the Hasselblad?
Jim, you're all right.
Well, the way to do that is just to play it straight from now on.
[Garble] I need somebody to take care of me.
15, This is Houston. Would you verify that the X-ray is On? [Pause.]
[Garble].
Yes.
[Garble] an earful of that.
15, Roger. That's verified.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Yes.
If [garble] orders, I can get it.
Okay.
Man, that's really good and stuck!
[Garble] all right.
Pork and scalloped potatoes!
We have not.
You'll have what?
I'm going to order pork and scalloped potatoes; I don't whether you do or not, but I am.
Okay, f - 2.8, 1/250th, and infinity. Take six frames. Okay. Right out of this window here. And we're going to get the pan camera going in there, too.
[Garble].
That's frame number - 14.
15, this is Houston. All systems are looking good down here, and until we tell you otherwise, all the AOS's are as in your Flight Plan.
Roger.
We're ready to go. [Laughter.]
That's right [laughter].
We both like to hear that.
Roger.
Now, I'm going to show you how I'm going to handle this stuff here. Well, it looks like we just lost them. (Cleared throat).
That won't be the same from now on.
It won't?
No. Minus 5 and 25.
[Garble]?
Yes. Because we're in SIM bay attitude now.
[Garble] A and B.
That's the stowed position only. It - it's minus 5 and 25 for Reacq when we come around the other side.
Okay. [Garble]?
Yes.
I'll tell you, this Moon flying could be fun.
This what?
I said, "This Moon flying could be fun."
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Hey, listen, Al, we got to get the pan camera going here, right?
Okay, T-start is the [cleared throat]...
[Garble].
Yes. T - T-start is the big time, and everything's hinged around T-start, so I take that time and punch it into P30 (cleared throat). And just load Noun 33 to that time.
[Garble].
We're gaining 4 - plus 42 23, I guess.
Yes, I'm going to do it like that on all of them. Now, when you come up on a thing like that, EL says T-start minus 1:40 -
Yes.
Well, it's right on the DSKY there.
[Garble].
And the Mapping Camera, Image Motion, On. Talkback barber pole 3 to 5 seconds, then gray. That can be done anytime; that's not important. EL Off at T-start; Mapping Camera, On, at T-start; Pan Camera, Operate, at T-start. Jesus, they got all kinds of things going on here at T-start. Motion Increase - talkback barber pole plus 2 steps. I better do that mapping-camera thing.
[Garble].
You got 18 minutes [garble] - If you'll take the EL, and all you got to do is - point the - point the Hasselblad straight down and start the intervalometer going, and start it at - at - at minus 1:40 on the clock and stop it as zero.
All right.
And it would be much appreciated.
[Garble].
Okay.
Jim, is my spoon up there somewhere? Spoon. Yes, it should be back in there.
[Garble].
Find it anywhere?
[Laughter] No, I'm not. I just didn't want to get in your way, believe it or not.
Ah, let's see; yes, we're ready to go over here; 84:24; at about 84:33, we better do all that business. In the meantime, grab a bite. What are we having?
Pork and scalloped potatoes.
It's not bad.
You know, I don't know why it is, every night at this time, my nose gets stuffy.
Mine does, too.
Every night, my - my nose starts getting stuffy along about this time, and then it cleans up after a bit.
[Garble].
Yes, give me another squirt of hot juice there - when you get a chance.
Hey, Jim, you know what I do tomorrow?
Can't guess.
Let's go shoot a landing. I'm ready. I'm ready to put that baby right in there, right now. I haven't had a TV flight in months.
Yes, sir, you better. You'll lose you [garble].
That's right.
0ooh, that one's stretched. Pork and scalloped potatoes!
Sounds good.
Just like down home.
Mm-hmm.
[Garble].
[Laughter.] Yes, you - you know, it really works - works just fine if you - if you pop it and just keep pulling.
Hey, Jim?
[Garble] water here [garble].
[Garble] I think, the first thing I'm going to do when we get back?
What's that?
Have a beautiful night in Tahiti.
Hey, you're on, buddy. You're on - you're on! [Garble].
No, really. You ought to really think about it.
Me, too. Big airliner.
Without the aviation,
Hey, you know what they tell you when you get to the [garble].
No.
[Garble].
Is that right?
[Garble]. They got up a special menu; it has everything that you want on it. You can eat steak and eggs [garble].
Is that right?
[Garble] steak and eggs, or scrambled. [Garble].
You don't [garble] scrambled eggs, do you, Jim?
Yes.
[Garble].
Huh.
[Garble].
All right.
[Garble].
[Laughter.]
[Garble], Dave.
[Laughter.]
You've been away too long, Jim!
[Laughter.]
Golly.
Yes. [Garble].
Is that all we get to eat?
Yes, I think so. [Garble].
We ought to be about through with that food locker.
[Garble] pictures. Do we just take them from straight down?
[Garble].
[Garble] you want to [garble]. You - you got that [garble]?
Okay, there's rev 3 [garble].
Take it out of window 4.
These will be the LM. You got all of them?
Yes.
And right at - the start of the [garble]. You want to start looking out the window, window 4. [Garble].
[Garble].
And then you want to [garble] off [garble].
That's right. Switch them back in stereo now?
Yes. [Garble].
[Garble] now. [Garble].
You know, that feels funny to look down.
Yes, [garble].
[Garble].
What's wrong, Jim. [Garble] doing the dishes?
[Garble].
[Garble].
[Garble].
[Garble].
I got mine right over to here.
Yes, I have them.
Okay. [Garble].
Ah, man. [Garble].
Looks to me like we're roll.
We're roll.
Yes.
Is - is this picture supposed to be an oblique?
It's not a - a vertical picture.
It's an oblique picture, really.
Minus 1:40?
Okay. [Garble].
Straight down?
No, you're [garble].
Pretty dark.
Yes. Okay. I see where we are. Okay. [Garble].
Yes.
Yes, but I - I seem to have it located myself here.
Oh.
I don't [garble], but it's dark in here.
Nassau Bay was in the dark, I'm sorry to say.
Yes.
[Garble].
I want to take one more for good measure...
All right.
...but now it's getting in an area where you're getting something.
Okay.
Okay, let me turn this over here on the - Let me put this back under here - the bracket; it's a good place for it to be.
Okay. [Garble].
Your next [garble] - is -
[Garble] 228.
But that's a - that's a good place for it.
Yes. Good idea. Run them back in here.
Really?
Yes.
Oh, [garble]. [Garble] I'm starving.
Okay.
Give me a lunch pack, and I'll eat it.
What is it?
Meatballs and sauce.
[Garble]. Need any help?
Do what?
Oh, isn't that sweet?
You want me to move? You want to get over here?
[Garble].
Meatballs and sauce.
Give me a spoon [garble]. You got something for those?
No wonder you never lose it.
[Garble].
One thing you're going to learn how to do is fly upside down.
[Laughter.]
Yes. Yes. You'll be able to fly right-side up.
[Garble].
Now I can see a bunch of [garble].
What [garble]?
[Garble]. Put it on the [garble].
Okay. Let me go to the movie.
No, by golly, there are lineaments down there all over the place, going - Well, northeast - Yes, northeast, southwest. See it? Right up on the ridge. Right along all the [garble], by golly. Look at that.
Look out the window, Al.
What's over there?
What? Right here. Look out the center window, right down this way. We'll be parking right over - right over the grid.
You mean right over the - the ridge here? Right along the lunar [garble].
As long as you [garble] having a - the ground track that changes every rev, you're never going to get tired of looking at new things. You know, you'll have something new to look at the whole way.
That looks dangerous.
[Laughter.]
You know, I about had meatballs all over the place.
What are you waiting for 2 minutes from now?
[Garble].
Yes. I'll [garble] a couple [garble].
[Garble].
I didn't mean to.
One minute to go.
You want me to get the mass spec and do what?
No, the boom out.
Oh.
Well, I was just thinking about that. I think what we need to do - is - You might take a little bath [Garble]. By golly, let's go do some around the Moon [garble].
One.
Huh?
[Garble] putting them on.
I figure we're far enough ahead - now. You can stop it - if you want to, you know, to live it up. Really live it up. Get clean, fresh...
[Garble].
Oh, you might [garble], I guess.
Okay.
[Garble].
Oh, look at - look at the one coming up, Al. Look at the debris in the bottom of that crater and over at the side there. Look at that!
[Garble] a tree stump [garble].
Yes.
It's got a big [garble] on the side.
[Garble].
[Garble]. Check The Bright One? Boy, look at the junk coming out of it.
See this one wall here - how it's completely collapsed, straight down, and a bunch - bunch of little benches go down even farther - towards the bottom.
The way that one [garble].
Which direction?
15, this is Houston.
Hello, Houston. 15. Five by [five, meaning 'reading you loud and clear.']
Roger. Like to remind you to configure the DSE as per the Flight Plan.
Roger.
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Say when we get down to the presleep checklist here in about 50 minutes or so, I wonder if you might give us your best guess on the probability of a DOI trim tomorrow.
Okay. We'll work on that information.
Okay. Appreciate it. [Long pause.]
Dave, we can give you a pretty good guess at that now. It seems to be unlikely that we're going to need a DOI trim. I've got a couple of trajectory numbers here if you'd like to copy them.
Yeah, it'd be interesting. Go ahead.
Our tracking data tells us that your current orbit is 58.2 by 9.1 [nautical miles, 107.7 by 16.8 km]. And, tomorrow morning at wakeup time, it'll be 58.6 by 8.7 [nautical miles, 108.5 by 16.1 km]. [Pause.]
Okay; that looks pretty fair. How about the - the out-of-plane or the cross track?
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Dave, our out-of-plane data looks like about 2/10ths of a [nautical] mile [0.37 km] at PDI [Powered Descent Initiation] time.
Okay; that sounds pretty good. Thank you. [Long pause.]
15, we'd like High Gain [Antenna] to Auto, please.
Roger. Hign Gain to Auto. [Long pause.]
Dave, thinking about trajectories, you probably noticed the out-of-plane part of the DOI [burn]. They're telling me here that you burned a perfect LOI, but the state vector they gave you was slightly in error. So, they got rid of - they - they made corrections for that during DOI so that we're standing pretty close to perfect now.
Okay. I got to admit we did have some question about that [out-of-plane component] but figured you all had it in hand, as you usually do.
Roger. Between a perfect crew in orbit up there and a perfect crew down here, we're doing pretty good so far. Knock on wood.
Yeah. We got a few miles to cover though.
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Okay, Karl. Guess I should bring you up to date on a couple of things here. Everything went as planned on the - on the [far-side] terminator photos. The Pan Camera and the Mapping Camera pass started on time and stopped on time. Turn - Got the Mass Spec. boom deployed and Gamma-ray boom deployed; the Mass Spec. deployed in 2 minutes, 20 seconds; and the Gamma-ray deployed in 2 minutes, 28 seconds. Got the Ion Source, On [means Standby], and the Logic Power, Off, at 85:05. And that brings you up to date.
Beautiful, Al. Sounds like all of that nice equipment is working real nice for us.
Sure does, Karl. Be interested in what kind of data you're getting down there on it. [Pause.]
OSO's [Orbital Science Officer's] two-word summary of it is that we're getting "beautiful data". Incidentally, Al, if - if you'd like sometime, let us have, say - 12 to 24 hours operation, would you like to have a summary sometime tomorrow on some of the details?
Yes, indeed, Karl; sure would.
Okay; we'll get one together.
Yes, listen. Skip it tomorrow; and, maybe day after tomorrow, we'll get a summary on that. I'll be kind of interested in how it goes myself.
Very good.
Houston, 15.
Go ahead, 15.
Roger, Karl. For your information, you can see both of the - both of the booms at full extension out of window 5.
Hey, we're glad to hear that.
Yeah; they sure do look pretty sitting out there.
Roger.
15, this is Houston. We'd like to have you hold off on putting the Mass Spec. Experiment switch to Standby, and we'd like to have the Discriminator, Low. [Pause.]
Roger, Karl. We'll hold off till you - cue us, and going Discriminator, Low, now.
Thank you, Al.
15, this is Houston. If you'll give us Accept, we'll send up a new state vector. [Pause.]
Roger, Houston. You've got it.
And, - and if you've finished with dinner up there, and somebody can copy, I have a TEI-12 PAD.
Okay. Stand by a minute, Karl. [Long pause.]
Houston, we're making a low pass over the Apennines [mountains], and they're really something.
Roger. [Pause.] Do they look like any terrestrial mountains you've ever seen? [Pause.]
No. [Pause.]
How about the slopes? Are they generally steeper than you expect, or shallower than you expect on something like the Tetons? [Pause.]
Say again, Karl. I'm sorry; we were discussing the rille at that time - Hadley, that is.
Roger. I - I was just trying to get a better feel for how the mountains look. Are there - are they more - more craggy and rougher than something like the Tetons or do they give you some other appearance?
No. As a matter of fact, from this altitude, even though we're low, they appear to be smooth and rounded. There aren't any jagged peaks that we can see. And even though they're cratered, and rough in texture on a small scale, they really don't look anything like the Alps or the San Juan's or any of the other familiar ranges we know.
Roger. Is there anything that looks like bare rock on them. [Pause.]
I think we can see some boulders, but there are no apparent jagged peaks that we can tell or that we can see from this - this particular altitude yet, although some of the - the shadows look fairly sharp.
Roger.
And, Karl, speaking of shadows, there seems to be enough light being reflected off the sides of the mountains around to supply some light down on the landing site. And the rille is quite distinctive as we pass right over it.
Beautiful. That must be an eerie sight in a half-light.
Well, it was, sort of.
And, 15, you can have your computer back.
Roger.
15, this is Houston. [Long pause.]
15, this is Houston. How do you read.
Loud and clear, Houston.
Roger. We've finished picking up data on the Mass Spectrometer. Leave the discriminator as it is, and we're ready to go to put the Experiment [switch] in Standby now. [Pause.]
Understand; you're ready to put the Mass Spec. in Standby.
Roger. And then you can start to put the blunt end forward, anytime you care to.
Roger; we're maneuvering now.
15, this is Houston. Dave, the Surgeon would like to have a special reading of the PRD [Personal Radiation Dosimeter] from you tonight. Your reading last night was not in agreement with the other two crew members and they'd like to get another data point on you.
Okay. We copy, Karl. We'll give you all three readings.
Roger. They'll accept them gladly.
15, this is Houston. Whenever you can copy, I have the TEI-12 PAD.
Stand by, Karl. [Long pause.]
Okay, Karl. I'm ready to copy TEI-12.
Roger. TEI-12, SPS G&N; 38110; plus 0.58, plus 1.00; 101:36:08.38; plus 2845.0, minus 0380.2, minus 0063.8; 180, 107, 354; the rest is NA; 4-jet ullage for 12 seconds. And this assumes the burn undocked and no circular burn, and the GET of landing is 196 hours at MPL.
Okay. TEI-12 readback: SPS/G&N 38110; plus 0.58, plus 1.00; 101:36:08.38; plus 2845.0, minus 0380.2, minus 0063.8; 180, 107, 354; 4 jets for 12 seconds. Undocked, no circular burn. Assumes landing at 196 GET at the MPL.
That's all correct. [Long pause.]
15, we need the mode switch in Auto please. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15. What - what switch you talking about, Karl? [Pause.]
That's the CMC Mode switch. I guess we need to get into Auto before we can execute this maneuver.
That's affirmative. And I'll go into Auto as soon as I complete the 40 degrees roll.
Roger.
15, Houston. On the Mass Spectrometer operations down there at 59 minutes, we'd like to have you keep the Discriminator, Low, as it is now. And, as the Ion Source goes On, we would like to have you pause in the Off position until you get our cue. [Pause.]
Roger; understand. You want the Discriminator left in Low, and want us to pause in Off on the Ion Source on your cue.
Roger. And I - I - think you know that we'd probably - that we - we don't want to go into those operations until we have got into the correct attitude.
15, this is Houston.
Houston, 15; go ahead.
Couple of special notes on the hardware. First of all, on - on the Systems Test Meter - we don't fully understand why that switch did funny things for us, and we have some back in - the fairly extensive tests going on down here still trying to understand it. And we suggest that you leave the meter in the 5-B position until we do get some handle on what happened there.
Okay, Karl. We copy that.
Okay. And I just heard the word that, if you really need it, go ahead and use it, but if you don't have a strong reason for moving it, leave it as it is. And on - We're - we're observing the radiator temperature - occasionally cycling above 80 degrees. This is out of limits, and we don't really have a good solution for this at the present time. We could think about turning on the evaporator, but that would foul up the Mass Spectrometer, and we'd rather not do that. The only things that it's - that the high temperature would be bothering are the IMU PIPAs [Pulse Integrating Pendulous Accelerometers], and we have - we - Since the temperature is cycling up and down, cools off on the back side of the Moon, we - or on the dark side of the Moon, we - we think there's no - no imminent danger to that system. So, our feeling on that is to leave the system as it is. [Pause.]
Okay. We understand.
Houston, this is 15 with some onboard read-outs for you and PRD's.
Go ahead, 15.
Roger. Bat C is 37 [volts]; pyros A and B are both 37.5 [volts]; RCS 83, 82, 82 and 83 [per cent]. The PRD readings; 23072, 25014, and 08016. [Long pause.]
Roger, 15. We copy all that. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is 15. The Ion Source is Off, and we're standing by for your word. [Pause.]
We copy, 15. Stand by.
15, this is Houston. Let's continue standing by on that Ion Source switch. We'd like to get all the way into attitude before we go into the On position.
Roger.
15, this is Houston. We're ready for the E-memory dump.
Okay, Karl. Coming at you. [Pause.]
And, 15, we're ready now for the Ion Source switch, On.
Ion Source going On.
Houston, 15. We're going to configure communications for sleep. [Long pause.]
15, Houston. Could you hold off on that until just after LOS.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, 15. Our last worry seems to be cleared up down here. We've got nothing more to bother you with, and all we can do is wish you a good night's sleep.
Thank you, Karl. Good night.
Good night.
