Good.
Everything looks good over here.
Okay.
Just - looks just about a hundred feet per second down on the H-dot, but everything else looks fine.
Okay, I got the big fireball going by at staging. I don't know whether you saw it or not. That beauty really goes.
Yes...
15, Houston. At 4, the guidance has converged. The CMC is Go and everything looks good.
Okay, Gordo. Looks good up here.
Man, I got the Moon in my window.
Yes, sir. It's out there.
Thrusters are stable; the ball's stable.
We're at a VI of 11,000 and right on the money.
Good show. Let me check here at 4:30 just to make sure.
That sucker's right on - right on.
Little high on altitude. I bet you they're going to give you the here in a minute.
I hope so by now.
15, Houston. Five minutes. Everything looks nominal. You're Go.
Okay, Gordo; thank you. Looks good up here. Got a smooth ride so far.
Roger.
Yes siree, looks good.
See, we're getting just a little teeny bounce. You feel it now?
Uh-huh.
Every once in a while?
Yes.
Very low amplitude.
Okay, be watching for the S-IVB for COI.
Okay.
15, Houston. Times are nominal. The level sense arm will be 8 plus 34, and S-II cut-off at 9 plus 09. Over.
Roger; 8 plus 34 and 9 plus 09.
And stand by for S-IVB to COI.
Okay, Jimmy; gimbal motors.
Mark. You have S-IVB to COI now.
Roger. S-IVB to COI. Jim?
Ready. 1, 2, 3, 4.
On and trimmed.
Okay, we're right - right down the line.
Okay.
Coming up on 15,000 VI, 260 H-dot. That's right where we ought to be, and that gives us an SCS COI.
Okay. Keep your eye up for S-IVB to orbit.
Yes.
Stand by for S-IVB to orbit capability.
Mark. You have it now.
Rog; S-IVB to orbit.
How's our cabin pressure, Jim?
Holding at 6.
Very good.
Feels like we get a little vibration out of that thing.
Well, it seems to be pretty steady though.
Yes.
We're about 1.7g, somewhere around there. Okay, 10 seconds to inboard.
VI's 18,000. We're at 96 miles.
Inboard.
Roger. Inboard.
Okay, about 10 seconds to PU shift.
Didn't even feel it. There it goes, 8:03.
A little bit.
Yes.
15, Houston. 15, Houston. Go ahead. Say again, 15?
Houston, 15. We didn't call. You got something?
You've had PU shift, and the thrust looks good.
Okay.
You've had level sense arm now?
Roger.
Stand by for Mode IV capability.
Mark. You have Mode IV now.
Rog. And a good stage.
Roger.

Roger.
Okay, Houston. Gimbal Motors are Off, and the S-IVB oxidizer is 40, and the fuel's about 31.
Roger; 40 and 31.
Okay, Gordo. We got ourselves in a 93.7 by 88.9; shutdown on a VI of plus 25595; H dot, plus 00008, altitude plus 00932.
Roger, Al. Copy.
15, Houston. IU shows you in a 92.5 by 91.5. Radar confirms that. And the booster is safed.
Okay, Gordo; good job. That was a very smooth ride all the way.
Roger.
15, Houston. The booster is configured for orbit. Over.
Roger.
15, Houston. I have your Z torquing angle.
Okay; go ahead.
Minus decimal 1 degrees. One tenth of a degree, minus.
Ah, Rog. Minus.1.
That's correct.
