Okay, Apollo 15; Houston. You're Go for undocking. You're 45 seconds from LOS, and we observed your Rendezvous Radar test. Falcon, also, we have not seen you reset the DAP.
Okay, understand. I'll get the DAP reset, and the tapemeter looks like it works fine.
Very good, Dave. Glad to hear it.
Okay, Falcon; Endeavour. I got the hatch in and you want to verify your hatch closed?
Okay, that's verified. Closed and locked.
Okay, I'll do a hatch integrity check then.
Okay.
Okay, Endeavour; Falcon. Our radar checks out okay, and your B-B, Off, and transponder, off, are no longer required.
Okay. Thank you.
And, Al, we're going B data.
Okay.
Falcon, Endeavour. Your transponder checked out okay.
Oh, very good. Thank you.
Okay, Falcon; Endeavour. We're maneuvering to Sep attitude.
Okay.
Okay, Endeavour; Falcon. Have you vented the tunnel?
Roger.
Okay; thank you.
Hear that noise with us, Al?
Okay.
Okay, Al, are you about in attitude now?
Right, Dave. About 5 degrees to go.
Okay. We're down to...
Oh, yes. We should...
just about everything and it's all shipshape.
Good.
Even the old broken tape meter seems to work.
That figures.
Okay, we're at attitude now.
Okay; thank you.
Okay, Falcon; Endeavour. Doing the trim maneuver.
Okay.
Okay. We're setting at attitude and I've got 10 minutes -
Mark - to go.
Okay, we're right with you.
And we're right on the attitude.
Okay, good.
Okay, Al, at 5 minutes to go, we need a - 06 20. Okay?
Okay, you want it now?
No, let's wait down until 5 minutes. Okay?
Okay.
I'd like to give them as much time on the platform as we call.
Coming up on 5 minutes in 10 seconds.
Okay, I'll give you a mark.
3, 2, 1...
Mark.
Okay. 35975, 10818, 35995.
Give me that last one again.
Okay. 35995.
Okay. 35915, 10818, 35995.
The last two were okay. The first one was 35975.
Okay; 75. I don't write too good with gloves on.
Roger.
Endeavour, Houston. Standing by for a Sep report.
Okay, Houston; this is the Falcon. We didn't get a Sep, and Al's been checking the umbilicals down on the probe.
Okay. We didn't read that, except no Sep.
Okay, Houston; Falcon. We got no Sep, and Al's going back into the tunnel to check the umbilicals now. And I guess we'll stand by for your recommendation.
Okay, Falcon. We copy. And we'll have some words in a minute.
Okay. There was not even any motion on the probe.
Roger. We copy.
Falcon, Houston. We have no probe temp, which indicates the umbilical is probably not well connected.
Okay. Well, that's just what he's checking. Thank you.
And, 15; Houston. Be advised that we have plenty of time here on the Sep, up to 40 minutes or so. Procedures will be to get vertical or get - now get vertical on the orb rate ball and standard Sep procedures.
Okay, fine. We can handle that.
Hey, Al, I hope you made sure the Extend/Release switch was Off when you went in there.
Rog.
Okay.
Apollo 15, Houston. We're seeing the telemetry on the probe now. I presume that may have been our problem.
Okay, very good.
Okay, David. I'm venting you down now.
Okay; good show.
And that probe was loose in the - the umbilical was loose in Victor.
Okay, I'm glad you found something.
Go ahead and take your time. And when you get all squared away, give us about 5 minutes or so, and we'll be all set.
Okay.
And there's plenty of time to get a good hatch integrity check, 15, and do the procedure leisurely.
Okay, Ed. That's in work now.
Houston, Falcon. In the meantime, can I give you the gimbal angles under Verb 06 Noun 20.
This is Houston; go ahead.
Okay. The GET was 100:08:56; and the CSM, 35975, 10818, 35995. The LM, 30009, 28836, zip, zip, zip, zip four.
We copy.
And, Endeavour; Houston. Reminder: We want the Sep in a local vertical attitude.
Rog; understand. Local vertical.
Houston, Falcon. You know, we've - You might run out of an attitude and a time, and it might save a little gas.
Okay. In 2 minutes, we have an angle of 55.7. We're working on one for 5 minutes later.
Go ahead.
Well, it's going to take fairly sizeable maneuver, and it takes a little while to maneuver two-tenths of degree per second.
Rog; understand. We're getting another for you for 5 minutes from now.
Better make it 10.
Yeah; we'll have one for every 5 minutes, Dave.
Okay.
And 15; Houston. We're not going to be able to make the P24 this pass, we don't believe. So don't worry about it.
Rog.
Endeavour, Houston. Let's head for a - an inertial pitch gimbal angle at the 30 degrees. And we may have to touch that up, but that's approximate.
Okay, Houston; Endeavour. Going towards 30 degrees pitch.
That's affirm, Al.
And, Endeavour; Houston. That angle is good for 100 hours and 38 minutes, and it's not very critical. We'll use it anytime around there.
Yeah. Roger, Houston.
Okay, Falcon; this is Endeavour. And I'm all set up again. The tunnel's sealed in and the pressure's good.
Okay, very good. Give me a minute.
Okay. And I'll stop the maneuver at local vertical.
Okay. Have you - Are you in Attitude Hold now?
Negative. Will be in just about another 10 degrees.
Okay.
Okay. As you get all set, I need about one minute to get P47 up.
Okay.
Okay, Dave. About a minute and a half.
Okay; a minute and a half 'til you get to your attitude?
'Til we're ready to Sep.
Okay; good.
Okay; let's go on one minute.
Okay; you got P47 running. You can Go anytime you want to.
Okay; I've got P47 running also.
10 seconds.
Roger.
Okay; we're on the capture latches. Good.
Rog.
And you're on your own.
Okay; good clean Sep.
Endeavour, Houston. Be advised your current attitude is a good one for your P52, if you'd like to hold it.
Okay, Ed; if you think we can't get there for the P24s.
Negative. You've only got 6 minutes. They say "No way."
Okay. We'll hold this.
Okay. Falcon's going to yaw left.
Okay. Falcon's going to pitch up 90.
Roger.
And you got four good-looking gear.
And, Falcon, Endeavour. Looks like you got one radar there that's - rotating away from me.
Okay. We've got you in sight; we're looking straight at you. It's really pretty.
Roger?
Falcon, Houston. Low Bit Rate, Aft Omni, please.
Endeavour...
Roger. We're Low Bit Rate and Aft Omni.
Roger. Thank you.
Falcon, Houston. Give us, on the steerable, Pitch, 155; Yaw, minus 50.
Roger. Pitch, 155; Yaw, minus 50.
Okay, Falcon. We're reading you well now. Give us High Bit Rate, please.
Roger. High Bit Rate.
And, Houston, we're ready to go with the DPS throttle check, whenever you are.
Okay; we're ready. Let's go.
Okay.
And, Endeavour, Houston. Give us P00 and Accept; we have an uplink for you.
Okay. P00 and Accept.
Got it?
Roger, Al.
Minimum is 11, soft stop, 52; max, 100.
Copy.
LMP is 11; soft stop, 51; max, 100.
Copy.
And, Falcon, Houston. We didn't see the throttle actuator move on that test. Check your DECA Power circuit breaker, please.
Endeavour, the computer's yours.
open.
Endeavour, Roger.
And say again, Dave.
Okay. You want to run it again real quickly, Ed?
Okay. Was the circuit breaker out?
take at it - take a look at it again with the -. Yeah. Rog. The circuit breaker is out.
Very good.
Okay. Do you want to look at the test again?
That's affirm, Falcon. Let's have again, please.
Roger-D.
Okay, Ed. CDR's at min, 11; soft stop, 51; max, 101.
We copy. And it looks good this time.
Okay. And the circuit breaker is still in.
Roger, Roger. And we're ready to give you an uplink, if you'll give us P00 and Data, please.
Stand by. Let's run the LMP check here.
And it looked good here, Falcon.
Okay. Thank you.
And, Falcon; Houston. Do you know if the circuit breaker was out, or did it pop? Can you verify what - either?
No, I can't verify either. We checked them over before undocking and - I can't tell you whether it popped or was open.
Okay; we understand. Thank you.
Rog.
Okay, Houston. We'll take the uplink anytime you want to give it to us.
Okay. Here she comes.
Okay; Endeavour, Falcon. We're going to run the radar checkout now.
And, Falcon, the computer's yours.
Rog.
Falcon, Endeavour. I mean Endeavour, Falcon.
Okay; Houston, Falcon here. Would you give the Endeavour a call. Tell them we're going to run the radar checkout now, please. We seem to have lost contact.
Roger. Endeavour, Houston. Falcon is calling, and he's ready for the rendezvous radar check.
Endeavour, Houston. Do you copy?
Endeavour, Houston.
Endeavour, Houston. Do you read?
Endeavour, Houston. Over.
Endeavour, Falcon.
Endeavour, Falcon. Simplex A and B. How do you read?
I read 5 square, Falcon.
Okay. Well, we lost you there somewhere along the way. We need to check out the radar and Houston seems to not be able to get a hold of you either.
Okay. I'm in.
We're reading you now, Al.
Okay, Ed...
I was...
Okay, Ed; I was off for a couple of minutes reconfiguring inside here.
Roger.
Okay, Al. If you'll go back to Simplex A, then we'll give you the voice ranging, and we'll check out the radar.
Okay. I'm Simplex A.
Okay. Voice ranging coming up. We're going to check the radar.
Endeavour, Falcon. You got your Transponder, On?
Rog. Roger. Transponder coming On.
Say again, Falcon.
Okay, Endeavour; Falcon. Can you give us your range, please?
Okay, Falcon. Stand by one.
Endeavour, Falcon.
Hello, Falcon. This is Endeavour. How do you read now?
Yeah, five by. Can you give us your range, please?
Okay. Stand by one.
Okay;.4, Dave.
Okay;.4. We're looking at.78.
Rog. Let me reset.
Okay. Reset.
I have you at.41 now.
Okay. Maybe we're just in too close. We're looking at.79 mile. We'll press on.
Roger.
