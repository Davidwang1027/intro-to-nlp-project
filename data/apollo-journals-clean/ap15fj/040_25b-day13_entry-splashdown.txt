Apollo 15, Houston. We have another entry PAD for you if you're ready to copy.
Okay. Go ahead, Bob.
Roger, Jim. It's still mid-Pacific; 000, 153, 000; 294:41:54; 267; plus 26.13, minus 158.13; 06.2; 36096, 6.51; 1084.9, 36178; 294:58:54; 00:29; Noun 59s are NA; 4.00, 02:12; 00:18, 03:37, 07:44. Boresight and sextant stars are NA, since you've done them; lift vector is up. Comments, 1, use non-exit EMS pattern; 2, RET of 90K, 6 plus 06; mains, 8 plus 32; landing, 13 plus 29; constant g is roll right; moonset, 294:56:37. Over.
Okay. The readback on the entry PAD, Bob, it's mid-Pac; 000, 153, 000; 294:41:54; 267; plus 26.13, minus 158.13; 06.2; 36096, 6.51; 1084.9, 36178; 294:58:54; 00:29; 4.00, 02:12; 00:18, 03:37, 07:44; lift vector, up; use non-exit EMS pattern; RET for 90, 6 plus 06; mains at 8 plus 32; landing, 13 plus 29; constant g will be roll right; moonset, 294 plus 56 plus 37.
Roger, Jim. Good readback. And I have some information on landing area and weather and recovery forces, if you're ready to copy that.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. Conditions in the recovery area continue to be good. Two thousand scattered, high scattered, visibility 10 miles. Winds are 10 knots, out of the east, and wave heights have come down to 3 feet. Altimeter at 3006. The recovery forces: the aircraft carrier is Okinawa. We have 3 helos: Swim 2, Swim 1, and Recovery. And Swim 2 is estimating to be on station, after splashdown, within 5 minutes. The two '130s in the area will be Hawaii Rescue 1 and Hawaii Rescue 2. Over.
Okay. Understand the weather is generally good. It's 2,000 scattered; 10; 10 knots from the east; 3 foot waves; altimeter, 3006. The Okinawa's there. The helos are Swim 2, 1 and Recovery; C-130's are Hawaii Rescue 1 and 2.
Roger, Jim. That's right. And noting on the altimeter, that means your Delta-H is minus 128.
Roger.
Houston, 15.
Roger, 15. Go.
Rog. We're getting ready to activate Command Module RCS and turning Logic and Arms on.
And, 15, we're ready to watch that.
Okay. Logic 1 coming on now. Logic 2 on - now.
Roger. Your Go for Pyro Arm.
Roger. Go for Pyro Arm. Okay.
15 your CM RCS press looks good to us.
Roger, Houston.
Houston, 15. Testing Command Module thrusters.
Roger. We're watching.
Okay, Houston; 15. Ring 1, test now.
Roger. Ring 2 looks good.
And, 15, ring 1 looks good to us also.
Roger, Houston.
Houston, 15.
Go.
Can you see the solenoids operating down there? We can't hear them up here.
Roger, 15. That's what we're watching. And we verified them all.
Okay; thank you, sir.
You're welcome.
Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
Houston, 15. Go ahead.
Roger. We were unable to monitor rates down here because we weren't set up for it. And we'd like to suggest that you might go back and repeat that check again. We suggest Accel Command in SCS; and you might try to monitor rates on board, and we'll try to monitor them down here. What we're looking at is only the solenoids down here and I guess, if you really push, that isn't a verification.
Okay. We'll do that.
Okay, Houston; 15. We're ready to test them now.
All right. We're ready to watch.
Okay. They're loud and clear up here.
15, we're monitoring good rates.
15, Houston. You copy? We monitor good rates down here also.
Okay, Houston. We copied, and we're testing ring 1 thrusters now.
And, 15, ring 1 looks okay to us again.
Okay, Houston. Thank you.
Apollo 15, Houston. We can try a VHF check now, if you will.
Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
Apollo 15, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We're ready to try a VHF check if you will. We'd like you to go to VHF Antenna, Left, and all of you turn off your S-bands and turn on your VHF T/Rs.
Okay.
15...
Did that once...
Did that once, Bob. And I read you loud and clear, but apparently you were not reading us.
That's apparently the case. And, Jim, I guess all we need is one of you to go to VHF T/R and S-band T/R, Off.
Okay, I'll do that.
Houston, this is Apollo 15 on Simplex A.
Roger. 15 on Simplex A; read you 5 by.
Roger. I read you the same.
Okay. And I guess that finishes it.
Apollo 15, Houston. Comm check. Over.
Houston, 15. Loud and clear.
Roger; same with you.
And, Houston; 15. We got a good sep.
Roger. Looks good down here. Thank you.
Okay, Houston. The horizon check was good, and the CMC guidance needles look good.
15, Houston. Say again.
Roger. The horizon check was good and the CMC guidance needles look good.
Roger; copy. Very good.
Okay, Tape Recorder's on High Bit Rate, Record, and Forward.
Here, my friend, is a lunar rock.
Yes. Floating around in the space of our spacecraft.
Yes. Wonder - The sequence of panels we go through is somewhat inane.
Oh, it really is, isn't it? God!
About 8 minutes.
This is the most leisurely entry we've ever done.
Yes, I don't understand how - why we have so much time.
Stand by. fast.
It'll go fast.
That's because we started 4 hours earlier...
than we normally do.
That's true. This is our normal reset burn, right here.
Apollo 15, Houston. You're looking good, about a minute and a half till handover to ARIA.
Roger.
Apollo 15, Houston through ARIA 2. How do you read?
Separation really unloosened a bunch of stuff.
Yes.
See my nut come flying by yet?
No. Nor your screw.
Listen, man, I've got my screw right here.
Got your camera all ready, Jim?
Ready.
Don't forget it.
I think I'll turn it on at - probably - Oh, look out the window, and you see iona - ionization.
Yes.
Probably be just before blackout, I guess. Blackout at PT. Yes. Before zero phase.
Looks like 5 minutes.
Right on. Time is right on.
Great.
Can't argue with that.
My dynamics - or trajectory's changing somewhere, because that light's coming from a different place now.
Oh, that's the Earth down there, baby.
Can you see it?
Sure as hell can. Yes, siree, I hope to tell you.
Are we going backwards?
It's big and real.
Yes. I can see it. Just barely see it out of my window.
Yes, we're going backwards.
Encouraging.
Just check the needle on the peg here; 51 and a couple of minutes until we're down.
Is that pausing from minimum impulse?
It sure is. Man, that's just bang, bang. That's really neat.
I keep thinking that, if I hit the stick quick, that minimum impulse will be less. Did you ever get that feeling?
Yes.
There's just a little bit you want to go...
It's right then.
and you try to get it and you can't quite get there. Yes.
Oh, yes. Hey - Oh, man, are we moving, too! Son of a gun! Sheeoo!
Yes, indeedy. You ought to be able to see it out the - out the hatch window.
Oh my, I sure can. Sure a lot of mountains down there. How about that!
Shit, I think that's Alaska out there. That would be right, wouldn't it?
Yes. Keep an eye out for the Moon.
Yes, keep an eye out for the Moon.
We've done it. Oh, we've missed it.
56:37. Oh, Al...
We were too busy watching the Earth.
why don't you pay attention to what you're doing there.
Too busy watching the Earth.
I'm not sure there's much you could do about it any - any - to correct it anyway.
Not at this point. Here comes the needle off the peg. There it goes. Now let me get to 5. Yes, 55.
Okay.
Neat.
Yes.
We just passed south of Alaska.
Did we?
Yes.
Little earlier than usual.
Apollo 15, Houston, thru ARIA 2. You're - We're getting good data. You look Go.
Houston, 15; go ahead.
Okay, the needle's off the peg.
About right.
What a view! Whew!
Okay, we've got about 10 - 20 seconds to Entry Interface.
More than that. Oh, EI, yes. I don't think I'm going to like it.
There's RRT.
Okay.
Getting the ionization?
Yes, man.
Put your...
Yes, look at it. Good.
Yes.

Okay, 98, Noun 18; boy, that's slick.
10,000 feet per second.
My eyes were cocked; 100 miles to go. I'm about 4 miles off; so - Looks like even the scroll's working great.
Yes. Great. Hey, now I know why you got to check the tunnel for water.
Yes, boy, I guess. Did you get wet?
Yes, man..
Yes, it really comes barreling out of there, doesn't it? (Laughter)
Okay....
Sixty miles to go. Okay, up.

Gee, what makes you feel - sound so hollow?
Sounds like... is about to make a low pass on us.
Yes.
We're coming up to 38. Watch your steam pressure, Jim.
Standing by.
It's 3,000.
No steam pressure yet?
It's going up now.
Okay.
