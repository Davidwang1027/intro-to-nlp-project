Apollo 15, Houston. Over. [Long pause.]
Hello, Houston; Apollo 15.
Roger. Good morning, Dave. It's time to rise and shine.
Okay, Bob. Good morning. [Pause.]
And we've got the usual quota of checklist changes, Flight Plan updates, et cetera. When you guys are ready, give me a call. Looks like you guys had a good night's sleep last night, for you anyway, Dave.
Okay. Felt pretty good. We'll get organized and give you a call here in a few minutes.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 15. [Pause.]
Roger. Good morning. [Pause.]
Good morning. I have a consumables report for you, and sleep report.
Okay. We're ready to copy. [Pause.]
Okay. On the Commander: PRD - 7½ hours sleep; CMP: 25012, same sleep; LMP: 08013, same amount of sleep. On the consumables: At 70:15 [GET]: RCS; [quad A to D] 90 [per cent remaining], 87, 84, and 88. On the H2 [tanks 1 to 3]; 90 [per cent remaining], 89, and 60. O2 [tanks 1 to 3]; 88 [per cent remaining], 89, and 65. Over.
Roger. And, before I read that back, we did not catch the Commander's PRD reading. [Pause.]
That was 23046.
Roger. Copy. Understand we have Commander's PRD 23046, 7½ hours sleep for all three crewmen; 25012 for the CMP; and 08013 for the LMP. And we have consumables update, based on our figures from the ground. For 70:00, we have [RCS] 84 per cent total, and we have [quad A to D] 85, 84, 84 and 85. And for H2 [tank 1 to 3] we have 91, 90 and 60. For O2 [tank 1 to 3] we have 89, 90 and 73. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. I - I'm ready for any Flight Plan updates you might have.
Okay. First we have Flight Plan update for the day. We'll start out at - Stand by.
15, Houston. You back with us again? [Pause.]
Roger. We've been here all along, Bob.
Rog. We had the usual signal break when we went around in PTC there. Let me ask you one question. The EECOMs are interested in getting a verification on the O2 tank 3 read-out, since there's a difference of 8 percent there. And, then after we get that, we'll proceed with this update. It's a fairly long one, so I guess you may as well...
Okay. Stand by.
...drag out your Flight Plan. [Long pause.]
Okay. We're reading - 74 onboard.
Roger. Understand 74. Okay, Jim. And we'll start this Flight Plan update at 71 hours, so you can tell me when you get there. [Pause.]
Okay. I'm there.
All right. At 71 hours, you want to add the following information. "High Gain Antenna [HGA] on MSFN cue," and note that we won't stop PTC. We'll have to give you the numbers [for the HGA angles], depending on where you are - in PTC, as we come around at this point. Second line is "S-band Aux TV, to Science, Pan Camera Mode, to Standby." That's a "Verify." "Pan Camera, Power, On. Pan Camera Self Test, to Heaters. Mapping Camera, On, to Standby. Then after five minutes, Pan Camera Power, Off, and S-band Aux, TV, Off." Copy? [Long pause.]
Okay. Here's the readback, Bob. At 71 hours, "High Gain Antenna on MSFN cue, S-band Aux TV, to Science, Pan Camera Mode, to Standby." That's a "Verify." "Pan Camera Power, On; Pan Camera Self Test, to Heaters; Mapping Camera, On, to Standby; after five minutes, Pan Camera, Off, and S-band Aux, TV, Off."
Roger. That's good. Okay. Next item at 71:15. This will be a line added in after the "CM/LM Pressure Equalization Decal." And the line says, "Press Equal valve, Close." Over. [Pause.]
Roger. At 71:15, "Pressure Equalization valve, Close."
Roger. And next one's on 73 hours and 15 minutes. [Pause.]
Okay. Go.
Okay. And at 73:15, we will delete the line referring to waste water dump. "Waste Water Dump" will be deleted. [Pause.]
Okay. I copy. Delete the "Waste Water Dump."
Okay. Next one will be at 81:42. 8 1 4 2. [Long pause.]
Go.
Okay. And, in the configuration for the camera there, we're changing that from "CM4" to "CM3" on the second line. [Pause.]
Okay. "CM3" is [garble] to "CM4."
Roger. Next one's on 84:24, 8 4 2 4. [Long pause.]
Okay; go.
Roger. [This] also [concerns the] configuration of the camera, and we'll change that one also to "CM3" instead of "CM4." [Pause.]
I copy.
Roger. And then over on the other side of the page at 84:40, again terminator photos. The first one, the first line there 84:40 will now read "EL, On" and the time will be "T start minus 1:40," one, four, zero. [Pause.]
Okay. I copy.
And then at 84:42, "EL, Off" will now be at "EL, Off, parenthesis, T-start." [Pause.]
I copy.
Okay. And we have two general notes. One refers to SIM [bay] door Jett[ison], and it's a reminder that we verify that the Lexan shield is mounted in - window 5, with the cardboard shade off, for a photograph of SIM door Jett. At - this is about 74 hours. [Pause.]
Okay. Understand.
Okay, and second one is with respect to the Optics Cal[ibration]. And I guess that we should explain here that - people are wringing their hands down here about the fact the we looked at a little bit of a bias drift when you guys zeroed the optics the first day, and we sent up some procedures yesterday saying to be careful when you are doing it for P23. And then everybody else got - decided that we ought to be careful when we did it for other things besides P23. And so, we have the following procedures, which are, basically, to avoid high trunnion rates for all optics zeroing, so that we don't get any - possible shift of the mirror calibration. And the procedures are twofold. First - I guess you might write them down some place - if the Optics power is Off, place Zero switch, Off, before turning the Optics power on. And then, after the power is On, drive the Optics manually to a Trunnion of less than 10 degrees before placing the Zero switch, On. Over. [Long pause.]
Okay, Bob. If Optics power Off, then Optics Zero switch, Zero? [Pause.]
Roger. It really is, "if Optics power Off, place the Zero switch to Off before turning the Optics power On."
15, Houston again. [No answer.]
15, Houston. [Pause.]
Bob, would you read that procedure again? Make sure I have it correct. I have Optics power, Off, then Optics Zero switch, Zero.
Okay, Jim. The thing is, if your Optics power is Off, we - as it will be like this morning, and the Zero switch is already on, as it probably is this morning, we want you to place the Zero switch to Off before you turn the Optics power on, because, otherwise, it will then automatically zero without you having any control over it. Do you understand? [Pause.]
Okay. We understand.
Okay. And - the corollary...
Read the - read the rest of it after the Op...
Okay. And then after, - Okay; I'll - I'll read it through from the beginning again. "If Optics power off, place Zero switch, Off, before turning Optics power On. Then, drive Optics manually to Trunnion less than 10 degrees before placing Zero switch, On." Over. [Long pause.]
Okay. That was after the Optics power on. Drive optics until Trunnion is less than 10 degrees before Zero switch, On.
Roger. And the corollary to that is if the Optics power is already on, then we drive the Optics power manually to a Trunnion of less than 10 degrees before placing the Zero switch, On. That's the second part.
Okay. We copy.
Okay. And then I have an update to your Contingency Checklist, page 4-3 which pertains to LOI burn rules if you can get that out.
Stand by.
Roger.
Okay, Bob. I have the Contingency Checklist.
Okay, I got 4 - page 4-3.
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Okay; I have 4-3.
Okay. And these changes are basically in the table there. - We'll start out under the heading of "Burn time." And that first one will be change from "00 to 1:36," now, instead of "1:35." So, it'll be 1:36 in the first burn time. The second line will be "1:36 to 1:57." And the third line will be "1:57 to 2:13." And the fourth line will be "2:13 to 3:11." Over. [Pause.]
Copy.
Okay, the next one in the second column, "Delta-VM," the lines will be 0 to, or "0-640, 640-784, 784-900, 900-1313." Over. [Pause.]
I copy.
Okay, and, in the second block, the lower block, under the updates for the times and angles, we have the following readings under the "Update" column. The GET [Ground Elapsed Time] of LOI ignition is "78:31:34.2," the second time is "79:01:34.2," and the angles are "144, 358, and 68." Over. [Pause.]
Okay, copied on the update time, "78:31:34.2, 79:01:34.2; 144, 358, and 68."
Roger. And, be advised, this also changes your little graph over on the side there. Primarily what it does, is to enlarge the mode 130 region by about 10 feet per second on either side and it changes the "LOI plus 30 abort Delta-V" line by essentially extending it and raising the left-hand corner just a wee bit. We could read up the lines too, if you want, but I'm not sure you really need those. Over. [Pause.]
Okay; understand.
We're coming up on another Omni switch, and we'll be back with you in a minute, Jim.
Roger.
Okay, 15; we're back with you. [Long pause.]
15, Houston; we're back up. [Pause.]
Okay. We read you.
Okay. Understand you really - didn't feel you needed the complete update to that graph, Jim. [Long pause.]
Jim, this is Houston. Is that a verify on the fact that you don't want the update on the graph? Over.
I think we can do it ourselves, Bob.
Oh, Rog. Okay, and that's all the update we have for you at the moment. You might be interested in knowing that that water dump you guys scheduled last night before you went to bed, was at a very opportune time. Your PTC shifted plus or minus 2½ degrees all night.
Well, very good.
We'll be up with the news in a while.
Okay.
15, Houston. We have a Pitch of minus 30 and a Yaw of 85 for the High Gain Antenna, and we'll give you a mark when to go.
Uh, go now.
Okay; minus 30 and 85.
And, 15, we're getting you on High Gain and receiving...
Okay; we understand you're getting the data.
That's affirmed.
Houston, this is 15.
Roger; go.
Roger. We just want to confirm the position of the switches on the Mapping Camera and Pan Camera. We have the "Mapping Camera On" is Standby, and the "Pan Camera, Power," Off. Is that correct?
Rog. If you finished [the procedure], that's the correct position.
Okay.
15. We'll take Omni Delta at this time please.
Roger; Omni Delta.
And, 15, we'd like Wide and Manual on High Gain [Antenna], please.
Roger.
Apollo 15, this is Houston. Select Omni Bravo, please.
Omni Bravo.
Apollo 15, Houston. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Joe. [No answer.]
Go ahead, Joe.
Stand by, Jim. I'll wait until the comm's a little better.
Hello, 15; this is Houston. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Joe.
Good morning, Jim. This is your friendly News Reporter on duty now. And I wondered if you'd be interested in something from the local newspapers?
Oh, yes. We certainly would.
Roger. This is from the MOCR Gold Bugle and Taglich Zeitung News. The Administration effort to rescue Lockheed Aircraft cleared a major hurdle in the Senate yesterday when an amendment to deny favored status was rejected 60 to 35. Houston unemployment rose to 4.1 per cent in June, an increase of a full percentage point from May, which is the highest in 6 years. And this morning's Post reports that the checkout of Falcon went on with a few words from Worden and virtually nothing from the other astronauts. However, I think that's incorrect and I enjoyed talking to you very much yesterday. In sporting news, Houston dumped Philadelphia, 6 to 3, and is now in fourth place, 10 games behind the Giants. And an interesting note from the North. Bart Starr underwent surgery yesterday for a bicep tendon transplant and will be out of action for at least 12 weeks. And that's all from the Daily Zeitung this morning. [Pause.]
Thank you, Joe. Enjoyed it.
Roger, Dave. Good morning.
Morning. [Long pause.]
Al, this is Houston. And we're standing by for your null bias EMS check if you've gotten to that yet.
Rog. The Delta-V test was good, and the null bias was 1.0.
Roger. Copy.
15, this is Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Roger, Jim. Just wanted to tell you to expect all your updates on time except the PAD; and we're going to delay the PAD to 72 [hours] plus 50 [minutes] because of very good tracking data we'll be getting in those last few extra minutes there.
Okay; understand. Expect the PAD about 72:50.
Roger.
Hello, Houston; 15. [No answer.]
Hello, Houston; 15.
Go ahead, 15. This is Houston. We hear you now.
Morning, José. Say, listen; on this - on the door jettison photography, we've got about 50 per cent left on mag[azine] A, and we thought we would go ahead and use that. [Pause.]
Good morning, Alfredo. We copied you, but I'm not sure that I understand your question.
Okay, Joe. No, it's not a question. Just wanted to let you know, on the 16 millimeter photography for the SIM door jett, the Flight Plan called out mag - stand by one. Yeah; it called out mag Echo, and we're going to use mag Alpha instead. We['ve] got about 50 per cent left on it. Just letting you know.
Okay, Al. Thank you. And, by the way, is that the maneuver where the SIM bay door jettisons the spacecraft?
It's been variously known as that kind of a maneuver, yeah.
Roger. I'm looking forward to that.
Apollo 15, Houston.
Houston, 15. Go ahead.
Roger, 15. I have a maneuver PAD, PC plus 2, when you're ready to copy.
Okay, Joe; stand by one.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, Joe. I'm ready; go ahead.
Roger. PC plus 2, SPS/G&N. 66313; plus 1.23, minus 0.12; 080:29:13.47; plus 3189.4, minus 2437.0, minus 1356.5; 175, 079, 332; all other is NA; ullage, none; other, burn equals SPS docked. Over.
Roger, Joe; copy. Plane change plus 2, SPS/G&N; 66313, plus 1.23, minus 0.12; 080:29:13.47; plus 3189.4, minus 2437.0, minus 1356.5; 175, 079, 332; no ullage; and that burn equals SPS docked.
Readback's correct, Al. Thank you.
Roger.
Apollo 15, this is Houston. We need P00 and Accept to give you a state vector and a target load, and we'll uplink when we get the next Omni. [Pause.]
Okay, Joe. You have it.
Roger; thank you.
Apollo 15. This is Houston with the maneuver PAD [for] midcourse 4, when you're ready.
Okay. Stand by one, Joe.
Roger; standing by. [Long pause.]
Okay, Joe. I'm ready to copy the midcourse 4 PAD.
Roger, Jim. Midcourse 4, SPS/G&N; 66531, plus 1.23, minus 0.12; 073:31:14.02; plus 0001.9, minus 0003.6, plus 0003.5; 038, 240, 331 - [Apollo] 15, hold off the P52; we're commanding, and go to P00 and Accept, please.
Yeah. Rog, Joe.
Okay. We - we're back in P00 and Accept. I forgot, there's no uplink activity light in the LEB.
Roger, 15. I'll continue with the PAD. HA is NA, NA; 0005.4, 0:01, 0003.2; 23, 106.1, 17.6. The rest is NA. GDC Align, Vega, Deneb; roll align, 209, 009, 349; ullage, none. Other: LM weight, 36256; SIM door jett attitude is nominal. Single bank Bravo burn. High Gain: Pitch, 21 [degrees]; Yaw, 243. Over.
Okay, Joe. Readback for midcourse 4, SPS/G&N; 66531; plus 1.23, minus 0.12; 073:31:14.02; plus 0001.9, minus 0003.6, plus 0003.5; 038, 240, 331; 0005.4, 0:01, 0003.2; 23, 106.1, 17.6. Vega and Deneb; 209; 009; 349. No ullage. LM weight, 36256; SIM door Jett, attitude nominal. Single bank burn on Bravo. High Gain: Pitch, 21; Yaw, 243.
Roger, Jim. Sounds good, and it's your computer.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. Gimbal angles are up [on the DSKY display]. We'll torque them on the minute.
Roger, 15.
Houston, 15. Did you get the gyro torquing angles?
Roger, Dave. We got them. Thank you.
Okay.
Apollo 15, Houston. Requesting the High Gain [Antenna], when convenient. [Pause.]
Roger, Joe.
Apollo 15, Houston. Just a reminder to load the DAP and then go on back. [Pause.]
Roger, Joe.
Okay, Houston. [Apollo] 15 with the burn status report.
Go ahead, Dave. This is Houston.
Okay. I guess you could see it was a nice smooth burn. On time. Burn time was a second. Delta-VGX at the end of the burn was .2 [feet per second]; there was no trim; residuals were plus .2, minus .1, plus .1; Delta-VC was a minus 2.3.
Roger, Dave. We copy. And we think you're bragging, but you have a reason to. Beautiful burn.
It's all this nice machinery up here, Joe.
Okay; Houston, 15.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. Suit pressure integrity check is okay. The flow was about .3 or .4 [pounds per minute]. And we're proceeding into the setup for the SIM bay door jettison, and we'll give you a call when we get everything ready before we blow it.
Roger, Dave. Sounds good.
Houston, this is 15. We're ready to turn Pan Camera Power, On, if you are. [Pause.]
Roger, Jim. Go ahead.
Okay. It's coming on now.
15, Houston. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, we're not sure that the cameras are running properly. We want you to check the two SEB circuit breakers on panel 5, In, and confirm for us that you got the right talkback when you turned them On. [Pause.]
The two circuit breakers on panel 5 are in. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Joe, there's no talkback called out here on the [line in the checklist which says] "Pan Camera Power, On." [Long pause.]
Roger. We copy. [Pause.] And, Jim, apparently, when you turn the power on, you should get about 2 seconds of barber pole, and then back to gray. It may very well have happened and you just didn't notice it.
Okay. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is 15. Do you want us to turn the Pan Camera Power on again and check that talkback a little more carefully? [Long pause.]
Jim, that sounds like a good...
Houston, 15.
...idea to us. Would you turn the Pan Camera Power off, wait 30 seconds, and then go back on, watching the barber - the - for the barber pole indication, please.
Okay, that's in work.
Houston, this is 15.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. We have the SM/AC Power, Off, down on 180 [sic], per the P40 checklist. Should we put that power on?
Jim, that's affirm. That power should be on, and that's probably our problem. Thank you.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. The SM/AC Power is On, and the Pan Cameras are [means singular] coming back to power at this time.
Roger.
And we got a barber pole for 2 seconds. [Pause.]
Roger. As advertised. Thank you, Dave. [Pause.]
Okay. I guess that's a spot in the clean-up of the P40 that didn't get carried over to the Flight Plan.
We concur. [Long pause.]
15, verify Map Camera, Standby, please. [Pause.]
Stand by. Okay; Mapping Camera going Standby.
Roger. [Pause.]
The - the Mapping Camera is in Standby now, but required a - a change. [Long pause.]
Okay; Houston, 15. I - do you want the Mapping Camera in Standby for the door jett.
That's affirmative, 15. Map Camera, Standby. [Pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
Houston, would you like the SM sector AC Power, Off, for the SIM door jettison?
That's right, Jim. Per the checklist, the first one in step four.
Okay. We just wanted to confirm it.
Roger. Sounds like a good idea. I think we have a bug or two in this procedure. [Long pause.]
Apollo 15, Houston. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Houston,
Roger, Dave. We're ready for Pan Camera Power to Boost. On your step 2 there, you are Go for SIM door jettison. And we want you to watch the Fuel Cell Reactant valves after the jettison, per the checklist - just a reminder of that. Over.
Okay; understand. And we are in Boost, and we'll give you a mark when we blow the door.
Roger. And we will be standing by for a description.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston; 15. SIM [bay] door jett. - 3, 2, 1...
Mark.
[I] felt a little shudder, but not too much.
Okay, Houston. We have negative visual on the SIM door as of yet. And the fuel cells looked okay. The RCS Bravo primary talkback went to barber pole and is reset, and otherwise no reaction in here.
Roger, Dave. We copy. And we assume you didn't notice any debris of any kind either.
Nothing in particular, Joe, and Jim's got a visual now. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. Jim's got it out of his window, and he's taking pictures, and he says it's slowly tumbling.
Roger. [Long pause.]
And, 15, just out of interest, we saw a good healthy jolt in our Doppler data down here during jett time.
Gee, that's very interesting because I would say that the jolt in here was very minor. [Long pause.]
Houston, 15. I guess the consensus would say that the - the shock was about one-tenth of the other pyros we've seen up to this point.
Roger, Dave. We copy. Can you still see the world's largest lens cap [the SIM bay door] out the window? [Pause.]
We'll check.
15, this is Houston.
Houston, 15. Go ahead.
Roger. We've looked ahead in - several hours in our Flight Plan, and we've - see no further inconsistencies between the checklist and the Flight Plan like the small problem we just had with the power. So, just wanted to advise you of - of this, and just follow the Flight Plan as usual. Over.
Okay, Joe; we'll follow the cookbook. Thank you.
Rog, Al.
Apollo 15, this is Houston.
Houston, 15. Go.
Roger. I've got a preliminary maneuver PAD for LOI [Lunar Orbit Insertion] when you're ready.
Okay; stand by one. [Pause.]
Okay; stand by one.
And, Apollo 15, if you'll give us P00 and Accept, please, we'll give you a preliminary state vector, target load, and a REFSMMAT.
Okay; you've got P00 and Accept.
Roger.
And I'm ready to copy the preliminary PAD, Joe.
Roger, Jim. Just out of curiosity, has the SIM bay door long since disappeared from view?
Yes, I looked for it a few minutes ago and couldn't see it any longer.
Okay, thank you. And I'll go ahead with the maneuver PAD. LOI, SPS/G&N; 66244; plus 1.21, minus 0.12; 078:31:34.48; minus 2894.5, minus 0766.4, minus 0112.3; Roll, pitch and yaw, all zips. 0169.5, plus 0058.3; 2996.4, 6:40, 2990.2; 25, 267.1, 228. The rest is NA. GDC Align, Vega - Deneb on zero degrees mark. Roll align, 264; 090; 349. No ullage. LM weight, 36258. Over. [Pause.]
Roger, Joe. Readback for LOI: SPS/G&N; 66244; plus 1.21; minus 0.12; 078:31:34.48; minus 2894.5, minus 0766.4, minus 0112.3. All zips for roll, pitch and yaw. 0169.5, plus 0058.3; 2996.4, 6:40, 2990.2; 25, 267.1, 228. Vega and Deneb on the zero mark. 264, 090, and 349. No ullage. LM weight, 36258.
That sounds good, Jim. Thank you.
Apollo 15, your computer.
Roger. Thank you.
Houston, 15. The first P52 is complete, and I trust you got the torquing angles. [Pause.]
Roger. D - We copy.
Okay, and processing the second one [the second P52 realignment].
Dave, did you copy? We got the torquing angles. Thank you.
Okay, and the second P52 is in work.
Roger.
Okay, Houston; 15. The second P52 torqued out at 75:19 [GET].
Roger.
Houston, 15. [Long pause.]
Go ahead 15.
Rog, Joe. Delta-V test, Null Bias Check. The null bias is 1 foot per second per 100 seconds.
Okay, Al. We copy. Thank you.
Rog.
And, Al, you'll be interested to know that the SIM bay data we're getting so far looks very good.
Okay, Joe. And you'll be interested to know that there's a very thin, crescent Moon in front of us.
Roger. We've been suspecting that all along. [Pause.]
And it may be thin, but it's big.
Houston, this is 15. The Pre-LOI Secondary Glycol loop check looked good.
Did you turn it?
15, we concur. [Long pause.]
And, 15, I have a TEI-4 PAD for you any time that you have time to copy it.
Okay; stand by one. [Long pause.]
Okay, Karl. I'm ready to copy the TEI-4 PAD.
Roger. TEI-4, SPS/G&N, 40015; plus 0.59, plus 1.21; 087:12:40.06; plus 3121.1, minus 2074.0, minus 0643.0; 182, 057, 329; the rest is NA. Ullage, 4 jets, 12 seconds, and this assumes burn undocked; and no DOI; and the roll, pitch, and yaw angles assume landing site REFSMMAT. And that's all.
NASA Headquarters, Goddard voice of Net 1.
...6; plus 3121.1, minus 2074.0, minus 0643.0; 182, 057, 329; 4 jets, 12 seconds, assumes burn undocked; and no DOI; landing site REFSMMAT.
Roger, Jim. The part [of the readback] I got was correct, but we had a loss of comm for the first part. Would you read the - about the first 10 [items] back to me again.
Roger. TEI-4, SPS/G&N; 40015. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is 15. Did you get all the readback?
15, this is Houston. We're having a comm problem down here on the ground and I need to check still your Noun 48 and your Noun 33.
Okay. Noun 48, plus 0.59, [Noun 33] plus 1.21; 087:12:40.06.
That's all correct, Jim.
Roger.
Houston, 15.
15, go ahead.
Rog. The LM/CM Delta-P is .5.
We copy.
Houston, Apollo 15.
15, go ahead.
Roger, Karl. All the systems checks are complete and everything looks good.
Very good.
Houston, Apollo 15.
15, go ahead. [No answer.]
15, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Houston, Apollo 15.
15, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. We've just made a little mission-rules review up here, and I have one question for you - relative to the circuit breaker on bank A procedure at 6 minutes. Our interpretation of the mission rules says that, if we have a bank B ball valve close prematurely, then we would leave that circuit breaker closed until shutdown, and close - or - until 10 seconds prior to shutdown, using that as our good bank rather than closing it in 6 minutes. And this is in reference to the cue card - at the bottom where it discusses one ball valve closing prematurely. [Pause.]
Stand by.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Houston 15. I'll just repeat it once here, maybe in simpler terms. If bank B closes prematurely, then we'll leave the Pilot Valve [circuit breaker] on A closed until 10 seconds prior to cut-off, instead of at 6 minutes.
Roger, we copy. [Long pause.]
15, Houston. We copy your question and we concur.
Okay, thank you. Everything else, I think, we have squared away.
Roger. Milt [Windler, Flight Director] says we owed you a review before every burn. Are you interested in a quick run through of what happens at LOI?
Sure, why not. Let's do it.
Okay. As I have it here, starting at T minus 2 - T minus 2 minutes, we close the Main B Pilot Valve circuit breaker. At T minus 5 seconds, we Pro[ceed, i.e. press the Proceed button on the DSKY]. Then the Delta-V Thrust A & B switches both go to Normal. At T plus 5 seconds, we Close the Main A Pilot Valve circuit breaker; and, at T plus 6 minutes, assuming nominal burns, we Open the Main A Pilot Valve circuit breaker; and, after that we avoid PUGS manipulation. And a reminder here is - don't forget to turn on the DSE because we're vitally interested in that single-engine [means single-bank] burn performance. [Pause.]
Okay, Houston; we're right with you. We've just gone through that and - we understand it. Thank you.
Very good.
15, this is Houston. If you'll give us Accept, we'll send up a new state vector.
Rog; you got it. P00 and Accept. [Pause.]
Okay; and I have an LOI PAD for you whenever you're ready to copy.
Okay Karl, I'm ready to copy.
Okay. LOI, SPS/G&N; 66244; plus 1.21, minus 0.12; 078:31:45.91; minus 2897.5, minus 0776.4, minus 0044.1; all zips for roll, all zips for pitch, all zips for yaw; 0169.6, plus 0058.4, 3000.1, 6:41, 2993.9; 25, 267.1, 22.8; the rest is NA. Set stars are Vega and Deneb; 264, 090, 349. No ullage; LM weight 36258. Single-bank burn time is 6 plus 52; and just a reminder that, if bank B doesn't burn, we are expecting you to go into lunar orbit on bank A. [Long pause.]
Okay, Karl. LOI PAD readback: SPS/G&N; 66244; plus 1.21, minus 0.12, 078:31:45.91; minus 2897.5, minus 0776.4, minus 0044.1; all zeros for roll, pitch, and yaw; 0169.6, plus 0058.4, 3000,1. 6:41, 2993.9; 25, 267.1, 22.8. Vega, Deneb; 264, 090, 349. No ullage. LM weight, 36258. Single-bank time, 6 plus 52.
That's all correct. [Pause.] And it's your computer now, 15.
Rog. And we also understood that, if bank A doesn't light, we'll take it on in with Bank - I mean, if Bank B doesn't light, we'll take it on in with bank A, We don't need to discuss that.
Roger.
15, this is Houston. I have a map update, when you have time to copy. [Pause.]
Okay. Stand by one, please.
Houston, 15. I'm ready to copy the map update.
Roger, 15. I have four times for you, beginning with LOS. 78:23:31; 78:33:27; 78:55:03; 78:46:44. That's all. [Pause. ]
Copied. 78:23:31, 78:33:27, 78:55:03, 78:46:44.
That's correct.
15, this is Houston. Everything is looking in good shape down here, and you have a Go for LOI. [Pause.]
Rog. Houston, 15. Understand. Go for LOI.
And a note here from EECOM that, due to destratification in your oxygen tanks, you may get a cryo pressure light; don't worry about it. That's during the burn.
Okay. Rog. Understand the cryo pressure.
15, this is Houston. [Pause.]
Houston, 15. Go.
Gentlemen, everything looks perfect down here, and - all we can say is, "Have a good burn."
Okay, thank you. We'll see you on the other side.
Roger.
...with a ... Minus 35.
Roger.
You guys got all your oxygen?
Yes.
Okay.
Minus 5 and a Pro, and a Delta-V thrust of plus 5 ... Okay. Pilot Valve, open. Everything else looks good.
One minute.
Okay. We've got ... here.
Average g is on.
EMS Mode, Normal.
EMS Mode's on.
And we settle down for the Delta-V thrust.
Yes.
Sit back and...
Looks good.
Clear to Pro.
Okay. 99 Pro. Ought to be okay.
And the Delta-V Thrust is on.
Okay.
B valves.
Ignition. 1...
Ignition.
...2, 3, 4, 5...
A's coming on. Okay...
...there.
...A valves. PC is reading about 90.
Okay.
Looks like it's running smooth.
... Okay. The EMS and the Delta-V and the DSKY look good. And we have tight limits. Very smooth.
Okay, the DSKY and EMS look good. Still in the tight limits.
A minute, and you're tracking Pitch 41.
Hmm! Right on, huh? Okay, the pressure's running 95; holding steady.
Okay. Keep going on tight limits.
The DSKY and the EMS agree. ... watch for the loose limits?
Yes. I should be able to ... loose limits.
Okay.
Five degrees, Dave. And the balance - unbalance is holding very well. About minus 180.
Right on the center of the roll dead band.
Dead on it - right on the side of the roll.
... on the roll.
Not even on the side. It's only at 4 degrees.
We have a Pitch 34. It'll probably stretch out after we go to the single bank insertion.
Yes.
Any ... loose limits?
DSKY and EMS agree pretty well.
The DSKY and the EMS are about 12 feet per second difference - is all. That's pretty good.
Mm-hmm.
... still no loose limits?
That view meter's not even registering.
Did you get your watch started on time, Jimmer?
We'll find out.
No, I mean, did you?
Yes.
Okay, because we need you to tell us at 6 minutes.
Yes, I will.
How are the pressures looking over there, Jim?
Beautiful. About 170 on both.
Okay.
... about 18?
No, we're about 12...
PC is reading 95 and holding steady.
Are we 12 feet per second - difference between the EMS and Delta-V?
Somebody would chew his ass if it didn't.
PC is creeping up just a little bit.
Okay, we're tracking Pitch 33.
Okay. Should be approaching the tight limits, Jim.
Okay, you're in tight limits now. About 2½ minutes to go.
Okay. We're looking good here.
Okay.
PC's about to cross over.
PC's holding about 90 - 96.
Okay, we've had cross over.
Okay.
It crossed a little, but not much.
Hey, listen. Your PC went up about 2 - about - 2 per cent, and it's up to about 98 now.
Okay, the EMS and the DSKY are about 10 feet per second difference. We're at tight limits. About 2 minutes to go. G&N's tracking 638.
Okay.
Five minutes.
Okay. EMS and the DSKY are within about 10 feet per second. Track at 638. Tight limits.
Okay. Give me a countdown at 6 minutes.
Okay.
You want Jim to count down at 6 minutes?
Yes.
You want me to give you a 10-second count?
Yes.
Okay.
A little dead band in there in the roll?
Mmhmm.
Okay, about 10 feet per second difference between the EMS and the DSKY, and we're looking good.
PC's varying between about 96 and 98. Looking good thoughl
Countdown. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
6 minutes.
Okay.
Can you reach it?
Pilot Valve A is out. PC is down to 94.
Okay, we'll need another countdown to the...
Yes.
...shutdown then.
Yes.
Okay. Can you reach them there, Dave?
Yes. About 20 seconds to go.
You've got 10 seconds overburn, don't forget.
Yes.
Start the countdown?
Yes, looks good.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, ...
Shutdown.
Okay.
Automatic. Okay, Jim.
Okay...
Oh, we log zero!
Look at that.
We'll burn them.
... Look at that, pal!
Did you...
Oh, I didn't...
(Laughter)
Ohh!
...dream any...
Look at that!
Jim, Jim. Let's clean it up, Jim.
Okay...
But whoo.
Stand by for gimbal motors, Al.
Fantastic!
Stand by for gimbal motors.
I thought I just gave you one.
I don't see it.
I'll try it again. All right, number one coming off.
One, two...
Two's...
...three, four. Okay. TVC Servo Power 1 and 2, Off.
Off.
Main Bus Tie's coming Off.
I believe it!
Yes, sir, that was beautiful.
That was fantastic!
That was beautiful.
That is the best burn I've ever seen and I've seen 10, I mean 11. that isn't real! I've never seen one come out that good.
Well, that's just superior cunning and skill, men.
Yes. It's got to be. Certainly (laughter).
Okay, Jim. Clean up the rest.
Okay, you got all the data? Got the EMS data?
Yes, got that.
EMS Function's Off.
Okay, Off.

15, this is Houston. How do you read?
Hello, Houston, the Endeavour's on station with cargo, and what a fantastic sight.
Beautiful news. Romantic, isn't it?
Oh, this is really profound; I'll tell you, fantastic! [Pause.]
And we've got a burn status report for you.
Okay. We're ready to copy whenever you're ready to give it.
Okay. I think our trusty pilot has a first for you on this one. Burn time was 6 plus 38, ignition was on time; the residuals were 0, 0, and 0. Delta VC, minus 4.8; the fuel, 33.25; the oxidizer, 33.3. [Pause.]
That's a beautiful job up there. [Pause.]
And it was a very smooth burn all the way, Karl. There was not a ripple. I guess the only little thing we might comment on was that we had a little PUGS operation after 6 minutes.
Okay; we copy.
And Houston. After our first few minutes of looking here, I don't think we'll have any trouble at all finding new things for you for 6 days.
Good enough. [Pause.]
15, Houston. We'd like to know the position of the PU valve and also the Unbalance meter reading. [Long pause.]
The Flow Valve is in Decrease right now. The Unbalance is reading about -25, and I put it in the increase position for about 10 seconds after 6 min - after 6 minutes.
Okay, Jim. We copy.
