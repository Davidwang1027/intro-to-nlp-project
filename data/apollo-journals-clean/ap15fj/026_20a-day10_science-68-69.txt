Apollo 15.
Apollo 15, this is Houston. Good morning. Apollo 15, this is Houston with a message from Richard Strauss, Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick.
A Space Odyssey")
Good morning, fellows. We have only about 10 minutes of comm left and we'd like to start out the morning with an Accept so we can send you up a state vector. Are you up there?
And after giving us Accept we'd like to have you manually roll clockwise 40 degrees. And then we'd like to get the sharp end forward. I'll give you the P20 when you're ready to copy.
Hello, Houston, 15.
Good morning, Al. How're you doing?
Good morning, Karl. I'm doing just fine.
Righto. If you didn't hear what I said before, I'd like to repeat that we'd like to have Accept, and we'll send you up a state vector. And then we need to manually roll clockwise...
Roger. You've got Accept.
Righto. Then we need to manually roll clockwise 40 degrees, and I have here P20 data for you to get the sharp end forward.
Okay; we're rolling, and stand by one until I get a pen.
Okay, go ahead with the P20.
Roger; P20, option 5; plus-X forward, SIM attitude. The time is 211 plus 40. Verb 23, Noun 78, plus 180.00. The attitude is 141, 000/177, 000.
Roger, Karl. Understand. You want that P20 turnaround done at 211 plus 40, instead of 212:00.
Al, we'd like to have you start the maneuver as soon as we finish the uplink, and that time is the time we should be completing the maneuver.
Okay. Fine, Karl. I'll just move that whole thing up. We're doing the roll maneuver now.
Roger. And while you've got the Flight Plan there, the only update that concerns us for the next hour and a half - is to - Over there at 21:54, delete Manual - "Manually roll clockwise". You got that one?
Yeah. Roger.
And everything after that, all the way down to 212 plus 20. And then we'll be in contact with you again for further updates.
Okay. Understand. That block between 21:54 - or 211 plus 54 and 212 plus 20, that - that all goes as - as scheduled.
Entire thing deleted. Roger.
Roger. Then we'll be in P20 attitude and standing by for your word when we get contact again then.
Okay, Al. The computer's yours.
Roger. Understand.
Al, would you do a Verb 66 for us?
Roger. You got it.
Al, we need the - the TLM switch in Block, please.
Rog, Karl.
15, if you'd like a quick consumables update, I can give it to you now or I can wait until the next rev.
Go ahead, Karl. If there's time, I'll copy it now.
Roger. The time is 211 plus 00; RCS total 46; Quads: Alpha, 48; Baker, 45; Charlie, 44; Delta, 46; hydrogen tanks: 49, 47, 39; oxygen tanks: 61, 64, 48.
15, this is Houston. Are you still reading?
Trade you for your cocoa.
35, 45.
Okay. Okay?
Right?... 3.
Here you go, Al. There. Okay. Good.
Here's your bag, Al. Give me your juice, then, Al. I'll take the juice.
I think I'll... Okay.... eggs...
We have sausage and eggs. How about sausage this morning.
Sausage this morning.
Scrambled eggs and sausage? That'd be good.
That'd be good. Yes.
Our favorite compartment.
sleep, Jim?
Pretty good. I just woke up once.
down there....
Want me to try to put that separator on the - dispenser down here, Dave?
Well, we haven't got any...
That's probably why we're farting so much.
What'd you say?
Probably why we're farting so much up here.
Yes, I didn't put...
All smells like hydrogen, really.
Check it here.
What's that number.
Okay, Dave. Here's that other cocoa.
Too late now. Don't be an Indian giver.
If you have something there to go in the hot water, Dave, I'll stick them on for you.
Yes, I got...
What do you want, Dave?
Oh, that's all right. What do you have?
Okay, I'll see what I can dig up out here.
No...
Be easier since I'm here.
Can you bring this back a little, Al? Will that go back?
Yes.
Anybody want any fruit? Lot of apricots and peaches.
Jim?
Yes.
How about some bacon squares?
Coffee.
Yes. Stick it on there. Did you tighten down on it?
Is it tightened down?
Turn around,
Jim...
Very simple.
Ready? You really have to push it on there.
Is it up all the way? Yes - you - you have to push pretty hard to get it on there.
Think it...
I don't know...
I don't know. Something coming out of there?
Yes, it's coming out there, but - looks like there's a lot of water collecting at the end of the separator. No, I just - it's got a pool there at the end.
In fact, it looks like it's leaking. It is leaking. It's leaking, Dave.
I guess it's just... water...
Went to bed at 9, Got up at 2.
Got up at 4!
Seven hours.
What?
When are we going to listen to music? Were you listening to - your recor - the recorder last night, Dave?
Say what?
Were you listening to your recorder last night?
Did - didn't you have some music on last night? I'd swear I heard music just before I went to sleep.
Put me to sleep anyway.
(Laughter)
Want me to put some hot water in those eggs, Dave?
About ready to go again.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Want some more?
Yes. Sure....
Apollo 15, this is Houston. How do you read?
Hi, Houston; 15. Loud and clear. How us?
Hi, Dave. You're coming through loud and clear. How did our consumables update get to you. Okay?
Yes, we got normal...
Okay. We got everything but the oxygen.
Okay. Want me to read those three up?
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. Oxygen tanks at that same time that I gave you originally were 61, 64, 48.
Okay. 61, 64 and 48. And I have a P52 for you and a crew status report.
Fire away with them.
Okay. The P52: Noun 05 was.01, Noun 93 was plus.029, minus.025, plus.018. was torqued out at 211:52:00.
Roger.
And if you still have your pencil handy, why, the sleep came out to 7, 7¼, 7. And the PRD's: 25026, 23182 and 08033. And go ahead with your updates.
Roger. Okay. Flight Plan updates for the coming rev and - There's several of them here. And just to keep you feeling a little bit more optimistic, on the following revs, there are very few updates. Okay. At 212:40, we want to delete "Map Camera Image Motion, Increase." At 2...
Roger. Got the deletion at 212:40. Go.
Roger. At 213 plus 24, we want to delete the "Gamma-ray Boom Deploy". And at that - there are 3...
213:24 have the deletion.
Roger. And just below that, the "MSFN verify lens tuck in" and also the "Pan Camera, Power, Off", delete both of those.
Roger. Copy the next two deletions also. Go.
At 214 plus 02, we want to change that camera configuration to the 250-millimeter lens, 250. The f-stop should be 5.6; the exposure time should be 1 over 125.
Rog. 214:02. Camera configuration: 250-millimeter lens, f/5.6 at 1/125. Go.
Correct. At 214 plus 06, add "Mass Spectrometer, Ion Source, Off. Experiment, Standby". And at the same time, add "Logic Power, 2, Deploy/Retract".
Rog. At 214:06, "Mass Spec. Ion, Off. Experiment, Standby. Logic Power, 2, Deploy/Retract". Go.
Roger. At 214 plus 11, "If Ion source, Off, 5 minutes, Mass Spectrometer Boom, Retract."
15, we'd like High Gain, Auto.
Okay. At 214:11, "If Ion, Off for 5 minutes, Mass Spec. Boom, Retract." Go.
At 214 plus 12, we add "Mapping Camera/Laser Experiment Covers, Open; Mapping Camera Track, Extend; Mapping Camera Image Motion, On."
Okay. 214:12. "Map/Laser Experiment, Open; Map Track, Extend," and "Image Motion, On."
Roger. At 214 plus 16, we change the "EL, On to T-stop minus 1:40" to "T-start 1:40." Simply change stop to start.
Rog. Stop to start. Go.
And at 214 plus 17, again change stop to start. And at that time also, add "Laser Altimeter, On."
Okay. 214:17, stop to start and "Laser Altimeter, On." Go.
And at 214 plus 18, change "Mapping Camera On, Off" to "Mapping Camera On, On". In another words, change Off to On. Add parenthesis T-start. Delete the next line, "Mapping Camera," - delete "Mapping Camera On, to Standby". And the third line, change "Mapping Camera, Image Motion, Off", to "Mapping Camera, Image Motion, Increase; barber pole plus four steps/On."
Okay. 214:18. "Map Camera, Image Motion, Increase; barber pole plus four steps/On."
Roger. And did you get the "Mapping Camera" - "Mapping Camera, On" on T-start?
Oh, Rog. "Map Camera, On", on T-start, and scratch the "Map Camera, On, to Standby".
Roger. That takes care of all the - all the updates required for the next rev.
Rog. Understand. Thank you.
15, this is Houston. A couple of comments, and then a - one change in your G&C checklist. The comments are as follows. As you will note from the consumables update, we now have single-tank capability at the 40-amp level.
Okay. I understand. Just retract it for 4 minutes and leave it there. Okay?
That's right. And has somebody got a G&C checklist there on page 9-4?
Okay. Stand by. We'll pull it out.
All right. I've got page 9-4. Go ahead.
All right. We'd like to correct one of the short burn constants, and it's in column D, row 5. The number should be changed from 1 - 01605 - it should be changed to 01614.
Say again the location.
It's column Delta, row 5.
Okay. I've got it now. I'm sorry. I thought you said B, Bravo. How about reading the number again, please.
Roger. The correct number is 01614.
Okay. 01614 by 01605.
That's correct.
And whenever somebody tells me he's ready to stop breakfast and copy a PAD, I have TEI-71 and also a Mapping Camera photo PAD.
All right. Stand by one, please. Probably be a couple of minutes.
Righto.
Okay, Karl. I'm ready to copy the TEI PAD.
Roger, Jim. Good morning. TEI-71, SPS/G&N. The weight is not applicable. P trim: Noun 48 is plus 0.64, plus 0.98; 217:49:18.04; plus 2838.6, minus 0581.0, minus 0027.7; 178, 129, 351; the rest is N/A. Four jet ullage for 12 seconds. And that's all.
Okay. TEI-71 readback. SPS/G&N. Weight is N/A; plus 0.64, plus 0.98; 217:49:18.04; plus 2838.6, minus 0581.0, minus 0027.7; 178, 129, 351; four jet for 12 seconds. Over.
Roger, J - Roger, Jim. And would you repeat the - the yaw trim.
Yaw trim was plus 0.98.
That's all correct. Thank you. And the last bit of information I have down here is a Mapping Camera photo PAD. At 214 plus...
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. It's at 214 plus 20 in your Flight Plan and there is no slot for it. You'll just have to stick it in. Mapping Camera, Start, 214:20:03; Stop, 215:19:49.
Copy 214:20:03 and 215:19:49.
That's correct.
15, this is Houston with just a passing comment to Dave. We have Lee Silvers and Jim Head in the backroom,r available for any questions or comments concerning the lunar surface activities that you'd like to make. Is there anything on your mind you'd like to discuss with them?
Well, it shouldn't take more than about a couple of weeks, I guess, if we started now. I guess we got a lot to discuss with them. We've talked it over a little bit. We've come to some conclusions about rilles and mountains and those sort of things. And I - I guess, rather than get into the details now, we probably ought to wait until the debriefing. If they have any questions for us, we'd be happy to answer.
Okay. It's my understanding that they didn't - you - you gave them so much data they didn't really have any questions left but stand by. I'll see if they - if they come up with some after you've invited them to - Joe says, hey, they just might have...
Okay.
something. So stand by.
Yeah, that's right. I've never seen the day yet when those two didn't have some questions.
You opened yourself up there, Dave.
Yeah, that's good. We're ready.
15, this is Houston.
Go ahead, Karl.
Lee and Jim are sitting right beside me here; and their comment is they - they don't really want to ask very many questions and perturb the debriefing a week from now. But they do just have a couple. And the first one - the first one concerns a unique crater close to Scarp that you described as having about a 40-meter diameter, with a very soft rim. And the texture of the material in it was - instead of being fine angular fragments, was more in the form of clods. They'd like to know a little bit more, if - if possible, about it's location relative to Scarp, and any other comments you can make about the unique - the particular uniqueness of this crater.
Okay. Stand by one.
Okay, Houston. I guess our answer to that is that we had interpreted that particular crater as being Scarp. Perhaps it wasn't. Perhaps we were near Scarp and that was a somewhat smaller crater. But, I guess, as we remember it, that was the one we had called Scarp, and it was, I believe, the only crater we really sampled as we approached Rim Crater in the terrace there. And that particular crater had very soft rims - extremely soft, and all the fragments - the apparent fragments were very frangible. They just fell apart like dirt clods. And we did sample some, and we had a discussion, I think, at the time, and - and I guess we still don't exactly agree relative to the amount of glass that was present in the fragments. Jim seems to think there was a fair amount, and I - I don't remember any in particular. But it was a fairly uniform crater. And all the debris around the crater, as I remember, there was something like 20 percent or so of angular frags - all of it apparently would break apart very easy. And there were no solid fragments that we could see or distinguish. Of course, everything is covered by dust. And we did sample some. And I guess that's about the size - the size of it. Is there anything more specific you'd be interested in?
Dave, this particular crater sounds more and more interesting to the people down here. And I guess the next question is what - Was there anything about the crater, it's shape or anything else, that would lead you to think it had a different origin than most of the other impact craters?
No. It - it's depth-to-diameter ratio was about par for the - for the course up there. And it had a slightly raised rim, and the rim may have been somewhat higher than - than others. But I wouldn't be able to distinguish that specifically. It - it was a rather standard-appearing crater, until we walked up onto the rim, and it was extremely soft. And, of course, we only sampled one edge of the rim there. We didn't get any circumferential sampling on it, so it might have been a - a unique part. But it looked pretty uniform all the way around.
Roger.
And, we did get the appropriate photographs plus a pan at that site, which, I think, when we go over during the debriefing - perhaps we can extract some more of what we saw. As you remember, at that particular time, we were pretty well hustling, and we didn't have a chance to do much looking at the maps as we got there.
They say that's great. Thanks a lot.
Okay. Anything else?
Hey, Dave. You've done a lovely job. You just don't know how we're jumping up and down, down here.
Well, that's because I happened to have had a very good professor.
A whole bunch of them, Dave.
That's right. As a matter of fact, so many of them, it's just hard to - hard to remember it all. But we sure appreciate all you all did for us in getting us ready for this thing. And I'll tell you, I think Jim and I both felt quite comfortable when we got there, about looking around and - and seeing things. I just wish we had had more time, because, believe me, there's an awful lot to be seen and done up there.
Yes. We think you defined the first site to be revisited on the Moon.
Well, as we go around in lunar orbit here, I can look down - and I could just spend weeks and weeks looking. And I can pick out any number of superb sites down there which would take you several weeks to analyze on the surface. There is just so much here. To coin a phrase, it's mindboggling.
Beautiful, Dave. Thank you so much.
Yes, sir. And I hope someday we can get you all up here too. I - I think we really need to have some good professional geologists up here. As a matter of fact, good professional scientists of all disciplines, not only in lunar orbit, but right on the surface, because you all would just really have a field day, where - with your backgrounds and what you know. There's just so much to be gained up here.
Great, Dave. Thanks a lot.
Roger.
15, this is Houston. Just a point of curiosity. Are you guys seeing Aristarchus and Schröter's valley in daylight yet?
15, this is Houston; 3 minutes to LOS, and all your systems are Go.
15, this is Houston. How do you read?
15, this is Houston. Could you give us a comm check, please.
