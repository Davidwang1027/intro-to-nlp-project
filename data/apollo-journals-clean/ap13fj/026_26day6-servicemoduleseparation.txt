Okay. If you're happy, can we maneuver to Service Module Sep attitude now?
That's affirmative, Aquarius. [Long pause.]
And I'm pitching up to the proper attitude.
Okay. We're looking at it.
And it's again necessary to use the TTCA to pitch.
Okay. Affirmative.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Recommend you terminate P41. [Pause.]
Okay.
Hey, Jim, have you broken into the medical kit per my recommendation a few hours ago?
Yes. Everything is taken care of Deke.
Okay, fine. You might hit it again in about 2 hours.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. Aft Omni.
I beat you to it, Houston.
Yes. I thought you did, but I thought I'd say it anyway.
Okay, Aquarius; Houston. That attitude looks pretty good. How's Jack getting along?
He's getting along, all set to go. And I'm going to go into PGNS Att Hold.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Again for fuel-consumption reasons, we'd like you to go back to the AGS mode you were in rather than PGNS Att Hold. Over.
Okay. I'm in PGNS Minimum Impulse right now while we're firing. And I'll go back to the AGS mode.
Okay, Jim. PGNS Min Impulse is okay; AGS is okay too. It's your choice.
Soon as we get rid of the Service Module, Joe, I think I'll be able to maneuver a lot better.
Sure thing.
Okay, Jack just reported that all thrusters fired on both rings.
Real fine. Real fine. [Long pause.]
And SM Jett at 138:12. [Pause.]
Roger. Understand; that's SM Jett, 138:12. It's not that time critical, Jim.
Can we do it at any time, Joe?
I think so, but let me check. Aquarius, Houston. That's affirmative. You can jettison the Service Module when you are ready; no big rush, but any time.
Okay. Sounds good.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We recommend that you use the AGS for the separation maneuver, because we'd like to get the proper weight in for the DAP before we use the PGNS again.
Roger. We will. Stand by.
SM Sep.
Copy that.
Do you see it, Jack? [Long pause.]
Okay, Aquarius; Houston. I recommend you terminate Average G. Over.
Okay, I've got her, Houston.
Beautiful, beautiful. And for you information, Jim, you'll be coming up on an RCS caution light for helium. No sweat. Over.
And there's one whole side of that spacecraft missing.
Is that right? [Pause.]
Right by the - Look out there, will you? Right by the high gain antenna, the whole panel is blown out, almost from the base to the engine.
Copy that. [Long pause.]
Yes, it looks like it got to the SPS bell, too, Houston.
Think it zinged the SPS engine bell, huh?
That's the way it looks; unless that's just a dark brown streak. It's really a mess. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jim. We'd like you to get some pictures, but we want you to conserve RCS. Don't make unnecessary maneuvers. [Long pause.]
And, Jim; Houston. In particular, of course, we don't want any translation maneuvers.
Right on that. Joe, you realize that when I went up to the SM Sep attitude, I had to use TTCA to do it.
That's affirm. We know that. That's okay. [Long pause.]
All right. She's drifting right down in front of our windows now, Houston.
Okay.
Okay, Joe, I'm now looking down the SPS bell, and it looks - looks okay on the inside; maybe it is just a streak.
Okay. Copy that, Fred. Was the bell deformed on the outside or just nicked or what?
I think the explosion, from what I could see, Joe, had - had stained it. I don't know whether it did any actual deformation or not.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Man, that's unbelievable! [Long pause.]
And, Joe, looks like a lot of - a lot of debris is just hanging out the side near the S-band antenna.
Roger, Jim. [Long pause.]
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
I know you're busy, but when Jack gets a chance, we'd like Bat C current and Main A voltage in the Command Module.
