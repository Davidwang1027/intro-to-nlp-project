Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
On the P33, just like to verify that you changed the Noun 88 values for this last star. It looks like they haven't been changed. Over.
Okay, Vance.
That's better. Let's read you what we - what we have. We have what they had in the Flight Plan, and if it's been changed from the Flight Plan, we don't have it.
Stand by 1.
We think you're right, Vance. It looks like they used the same set of Noun 88 for both stars by mistake.
Okay, very good.
Okay, Vance. That ought to complete the P23s, right?
Okay. Very good, Jack.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
We have some results on your - your first star, if you'd like to hear them. The rest of the stars we'll - we'll have to give you in a couple of hours. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, the first star: the corrected altitude, 15 kilometers plus or minus 4; effective altitude, 12 kilometers plus or minus 7. As far as the substellar point, the value is arc-minutes - 2 arc-minutes, and that's very good. And, like I said, we'll get back with you in a couple of hours for the rest.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Okay. We have several items, here. First, is a reminder on the PTC that R1 should be 375 - 0.375 degrees as last night, to get 0.3-degree rotation rate. The second one...
Okay. Copy that.
Okay. The second one, at 32 hours looking at Bennett's Comet - we want the pictures taken when the spacecraft is as stable as it's going to be before starting PTC. The stability requirement is very high. We weren't sure if you understood that from what we passed up. In addition, the photographs might not show as much as the eye can see of the comet, so if you see anything interesting about the structure of the comet, why, sketching it is in order - is in order and is encouraged. Over.
Okay, Vance. What we'll do is, when we get to attitude, we'll disable the quads and do like we did last night; we'll let GUIDO and you people down there tell us when you think we're stable enough; then we'll do all this work with the DAC on the sextant, first; and then when we get that done, we'll go back and put the sextant eyepiece back on and see what we can observe visually.
Okay. That sounds good. Also, while you are waiting for the vehicle to stabilize, it might be interesting to have the eyepiece on and be looking at it visually. Okay. Next item: your SPS burn had no anomalies whatsoever. It was a very good burn.
Okay. Very good.
Next item: request hydrogen tank 1 Heater, Off, for balancing purposes.
And Apollo 13, another item: something that we have observed and you might be seeing is a slight TCE fluctuation on fuel cell 3. This fluctuation has been going from about 152 to 160 over a 37-second period. It has been seen on other flights in the past. No one is worried about it, but the usual fluctuation is about 1½ degrees instead of the second - instead of 7 seconds, so thought you should be aware of it.
Okay, Vance. And one other slight distinction we've noted is the flow of hydrogen versus the oxygen is not exactly matched on fuel cell 3 either.
Okay. We copy. And the last item: we'd like to send you an IRIG update, so at your convenience, request P00 and Accept.
Okay. We're in P00 and Accept, Vance.
Okay.
Quad C and D are disabled, Vance.
Roger. Disabled. And down here, we see that your hydrogen and oxygen on the fuel cell are exactly matched, so we suspect it's purely a spacecraft read-out problem.
Okay.
Okay, Vance, let us know when you're through with the DSKY so we can load Noun 88?
Rog. We'll let you know, Jack.
Apollo 13, Houston. The computer's yours, again.
Okay. You're Go for the pictures.
Okay, Vance. We tried our Auto Optics and couldn't pick it up there. We're pointing pretty much right into the Sun, and things are pretty well washed out. And I've gone to Manual Optics and I'm trying to get 0.8, 12.5 on the shaft and trunnion, and I still can't pick it up. So - it's very light in the sextant, so I kind of think maybe we're too near the Sun to see it.
That's right, Vance. The sextant is all - it's - it's all milky and it - any comet that could be seen through there is just going to be missed in the background.
Okay, we copy that. We got some discussion. Stand by.
Okay, Vance, it isn't - we're not looking into the Sun - what we are getting is a large reflection from the Sun behind us off the LM; and it is - it is coming on that quad 1 there, and that quad is reflecting back into the sextant.
Okay, Jack. Understand. Just a question: if you look through the telescope, can you see the comet at all? Over.
No, I can't, Vance. It's - it's still too light.
Does that
Stand by.
Say, Vance?
Roger. Go ahead.
Are the flowers blooming yet?
Gee, I sure haven't seen any.
Okay.
Hey, we've - we've got quite a discussion down here on your trying to observe the comet, and this reflection is not unexpected. And give us another minute, and we'll be back with you on something on that.
Okay. I doubt very seriously though, if we take any photographs with high-speed black and white with the light coming into the sextant that you're going to get anything out of it.
Okay. Unanimous opinion is that you're right, and we'll scratch all of this Bennett Comet stuff on the way out, with the hope that conditions will be more favorable after TEI. Over.
Sounds good. Without the LM, we may have a better chance.
Rog.
And Apollo 13, you're Go for PTC. Your rates are very low according to what we can read.
Rog, Vance.
Okay. Are you going to give a call on Omni B, Vance?
Do you read, Vance?
Roger. Go ahead. Request Omni B, Fred, and secure the High Gain Antenna.
Okay. You got it.
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Just something to think about. In about 30 minutes, we can generate the PADs that we have yet to send up before the sleep period, so we could support an earlier sleep period if you so desired. And - but it will take us 30 minutes to get that stuff. The other thing is any time you're ready to copy, I can read up these solo book changes. Over - And, also, two pages in the Flight Plan.
Okay, Vance. We're about ready to copy the solo book changes and the Flight Plan changes, and whenever your PADs are ready, we'll take those. And as far as moving up the sleep period, that's fine, but we'll - if we don't go to sleep right away, we'll use it to get out some of our lunar maps and study them.
Okay. And we'll get busy getting those PADs for you as soon as possible then, and I'll stand by on the copying bit.
Okay, Vance, I'm ready to copy the solo book changes there.
Okay. First, turn to page 12. On the right-hand side of the page, starting from the middle of the page down, under - everything under "Cycle 5 frames, Replace dark side or dark slide" should be deleted until you get to the very bottom of the page where you have "Acquisition MSFN Omni D" and that should remain in. Also, leave in "Remove window shades," which is about the third line down from where you start.
Okay. Ah, okay. Then from "Cycle 5 frames, Replace dark slide," from there on down, delete.
That's everything from there on down, with the exception of "Remove window shades" and at the bottom "Acquisition MSFN Omni D."
Okay. Copy.
And that includes in the margin to the left, the "DAP load" that's at the very start there and the "0.0507" and "plus 0500," further down.
Okay. Got it.
Okay. Going to page 13.
Okay.
Okay, in the left margin, just below 105 hours GET, cross out the "0507" and the "plus 0500," and below that, add in "DAP load" as follows: "10111 and 11111."
Okay. Got it.
Okay. Now, next, at about 105:05, there's a "Verb 48." That should be moved up to 105, and below that, the "Verb 49 maneuver" should be moved up, too.
Okay. That "Verb 48" should be moved up to 105:05 and also the "Verb 49".
That should be moved up to 105:00. I'm sorry. Both.
Okay.
And what that does is give you more time to maneuver.
Okay. Next.
All right.
Page 14, right-hand side, near the bottom under "Orbital Science," scratch out "Verify DSE On," and also delete "Visual target 3 on track 180 plus 19," and cross out the penned-in "D5".
Okay. Got it.
Next, page 15, left-hand column, or left-hand side, rather, near the bottom, where it says "Configure cameras and tape" and goes down through "Replace dark slide." Just make the comment there, "Solar corona is optional." Over.
Okay. Got it.
Okay, next page, 16. This is a continuation of the same solar-corona thing. On the right-hand side of the page, starting just above 107:40 with "Verb 49, maneuver to solar-corona attitude," from there, on down to 107:55 just beneath "Replace dark slide," all of this is in an optional category. So you just might line off...
All right. Got it.
that and put "Optional, solar corona." Okay, next page, 17...
Okay.
starting at 108:00 on the left-hand side, line out "Stop Orb rate at Orb science attitude." At - Line out in the left-hand column, the DAP load of "10101" and "11111." Going down to 108:10, add in the following: "Stop Orb rate at track attitude," and in parentheses, "0, 353, 0." In the left-hand...
Okay.
Okay, in the left-hand column under 108:10, put in a DAP load in parentheses of "10101" and, under that, "11111".
Okay.
Beneath that, scratch out "Spacecraft control dash CMC, Auto, Verify." Scratch out the "Verb 79" and all in parentheses after that, like the "Minus 00507," et cetera. And beneath that, scratch out "Pro to start pitch rate." In parentheses, "0, 230 slash 018, 0".
Okay.
Okay. Looking to the right, the LM attitude or rather the CSM attitude will be incorrect, so you can cross that off. And beneath the picture of the Moon, cross out the - in parentheses, "108.19" and the "0, 230/018, 0".
All right.
On the right-hand half of the page, cross out the "Orbital science block," and under that "Visual target 1 south of track TR." And under that, the penned-in "D2/3/4".
All right. Got it.
And beneath that, cross out "Verb 49, maneuver to track attitude", parentheses "0, 353, 0" and the "HU, SCF".
All right.
Okay. The information beneath that starting with "Configure camera earthshine photos" down through "Replace dark slide" is optional. So just put in "Earthshine optional" as a comment there, and, in the camera settings, in the block that has "f:2.8, 125, infinity," cross out the "125" and put in "one-eighth," 1 slash 8, in other words.
Okay, that last part was, cross out the "125" and put in "1/8." Is that right?
That's affirm. Okay. Next page. No change. Go to page 19.
Okay.
Okay. On the right-hand side, from the "Verb 49, maneuver to earthshine attitude," down through everything up to "MSFN uplink," this is optional. This is "Earthshine optional".
All right. Got it.
And once again, a camera-setting correction up near the top of that section that we called optional, where you have "bracket MIR f:0.9, 125", cross out the "125" and put in "1 slash 60." In other words, one-sixtieth. Over.
Okay. Cross out the "125" and put in "1 slash 60".
That's correct. And further down at 109:50, where you have "Visual target 17" et cetera, cross out that line and cross out the penned-in "D17."
Okay.
Now, move to page 25.
Okay, go ahead, Vance.
Okay. At about 114:10, everything under "Altitude set equals 60 miles" should have the comment "Solar corona, optional," and on that first line of that optional where it says "Verb 49, maneuver to solar corona and limb brightening attitude," cross out "And limb brightening attitude".
Okay.
Going further down to 114:16, cross out the "14 DAC 18 VHBW limb brightening" line and the line under that which is "BRKT, MIR," et cetera.
All right.
In the block where it says "Solar corona and limb brightening photos," cross out "And limb brightening photos" and just put "Solar corona, optional."
Okay. Got it.
Going a few lines below that, where you see "DAC On for 4 seconds at about 50 frame rate cover lens", cross that out.
Hey, Vance, we lost you there, or did you?
Yeah, I think we lost lock. We'll stand by a minute.
Okay, I got you back.
Okay. Going on down, cross out "114:29:16, DAC On, SR dash 40 seconds."
Okay.
And at the very bottom line on that half of the page should be crossed out which is "114:29:56, DAC Off, SR".
Okay.
On the right-hand side of page 25, where you have the title "Solar corona and limb brightening photography," cross out "limb brightening photography".
Okay.
And in the figure, where you have the "DAC LOS" line, which is parallel to the X-axis on the horizon, cross out "DAC LOS" parallel to X-axis on horizon.
All right.
And cross out the bottom block on that half of the page which is "DAC magazine percent required 12 magazines, g" et cetera.
All right.
Next page, 26.
Go ahead.
Okay. Cross out the top line on the right-hand side of that page, which is "DAC on for 4 seconds, 50 frame rate cover lens." And cross out the block to the right of that and down, which has "Magazine percent."
All right. Got it.
Okay. Next, page 28.
Ready to go?
Go ahead.
Okay. On the left-hand side of page 28, at the very bottom, cross out "Photo target 5 north, frame f:5.6, 250, infinity," et cetera. All of that line over to the vertical strip. And cross out the penned-in "E4" below that.
Okay, go ahead.
Okay, and the next page, 29, right-hand side near the top, cross out "Photo target 13, north, f:5.6, 250," et cetera, all of that line. And cross out beneath that the penned-in "E5 slash 6".
All right.
Going to page 30, next, left-hand side.
Go ahead.
At the top at 127:01, cross out "Visual target 9 on track, 180 degrees, plus 0.47," and cross out the penned-in "E11" beneath that.
Okay.
Going down to 127:11, cross out "Verify DSE On." Beneath that a ways, cross out "127:14:20, start visual observations of Fra Mauro."
All right.
Beneath that, cross out "Continue visual observations," and cross out "Stop observations." And beneath that, cross out "Photo target 56 on track, f:8, 250, infinity, 5," et cetera, to the end of that line. Cross out the "5.6" beneath that and the penned-in "E15."
Okay.
Over in the margin, to the left of all that, make a comment: "Delete visual only."
Where was that, Vance? I didn't get that last one.
Okay. That's still on page 30, on the left-hand side. In the time - in the margin at the left where you have times, just pen in beneath the "127:10" the following: "Delete visual only." That's only a comment.
Okay. All right.
Okay. Going to page 34.
Okay.
About - on the left-hand side about almost halfway down beneath the "Verb 49, maneuver to TOPO target 54A," make the comment "Target 54A is optional."
All right. Got it.
And, next, page 35, on the right-hand side. Everything from "Spacecraft control, CMC, Auto, Verify" on down, should be given the comment "Zodiacal light photos optional."
All right.
And, well, where you have the block in the middle of the page that says - the small block that says "Zodiacal light photos," just put "Optional" in that title, too.
Okay.
And, next, page 36, on the left-hand side.
Okay, go ahead.
Okay. First, a comment. In the middle of the page is where the zodiacal light stuff ends, just under Verb 48. And then, if you'll go down to the bottom of the page, cross out the line "Photo target 12 on track," et cetera, and cross out the "E5" that is below that line.
Okay, Vance, can I break in a minute?
Sure.
We have the Cryo Pressure light on now. The H2 has hit its lower bound, so do you want us to go back to Auto on the H2 Heater 1?
Stand by.
13, Houston.
All right, go ahead.
They request that you leave that switch in the Auto position until you go to bed tonight. Stand by. I mean in the On position. I'll repeat that again. In the Off position until you go to bed tonight for reasons that you have a 3-percent imbalance, and they'd like to get that more even. So, just before turning in, we'll change the switch to Auto.
Okay.
Okay, Vance, continue.
Okay...
Before we get away, would you ask FAO - something I didn't get briefed on - what the penned-in E5 and those letters and numbers mean?
Okay. Just 1 minute.
Okay, we'll have comments on that for you in just a second.
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Okay, Vance, I'm ready to continue. I'm ready. Go ahead.
Okay, new subject. Like to break in to say that request you re-initialize the PTT - PTC. For some reason, it's gone up to 18 degrees in pitch and yaw both. We don't quite understand this. All we can think of is - start it again. Over.
Okay. We'll go back.
Okay. We are at the - the end of the changes in the solo book, and I have two pages of changes in the Flight Plan. Those are pages 3-122 and 3-125. While you're looking that up, we'll put Ken on to answer your question.
Okay. I'll start - let me start back re-initializing PTC here.
Okay.
Okay, Vance, I'm on 3-122 of the Flight Plan.
Okay. Okay, about - at time 156:50 on the right - well, on the right-hand half of the page, there's a line which states "Visual target 16, south, 180 plus 1:11, Gassendi, f:15." Request you cross out that line.
Okay, we're crossing it out.
That's all on 3-122. Next change is 3-125.
Okay, I'm looking at 125.
Okay, starting from the top of the page, cross out the first five lines, which are "Set up camera for contamination and photography, Betelgeuse, CM4/EL/80," et cetera, "Mag T," et cetera, "Install window shades".
I've got them crossed.
Okay, then jump down to just about 159:28. Cross out "Maneuver to contamination field photography attitude," and all other lines below that through "Enable thrusters A3, C4, B3," et cetera.
Okay, so we start with "Maneuver to contamination field photography," and we cross out everything down to and including "Enable thrusters A3, C4, B3, and D4".
That's correct. And those are all of the flight changes - Flight Plan changes we have. And Ken is coming on now and later sometime when we get the PTC squared away, and it's convenient, I suppose you should read all these things back to make sure that we are squared away on them.
Okay. Go ahead, TK.
Yes, sir. Understand you have a question.
Yeah. I guess I didn't understand what the letter and the number was behind some of these photo targets.
Okay...
Does that refer to a page?
Yes, sir. That's the map. Each fold is lettered in the lower - or upper right-hand corner if you work your way from east to west and the charts are labeled D, E, and F and the solo stuff will all be the D and E, and they change with the plane change 1. That's the time they change the two maps.
Okay. I got it. Thank you.
Yes, sir. You're doing good work, hey.
Well, I had a good prime crewman that taught me all I know.
Don't run out.
Hey, when FIDO gets a good hack on our trajectory, will you let us know?
How long are you willing to wait?
He's looking at his calendar, if that means anything.
Rog.
Okay. I'm back at the attitude here, and I'll wait for rates to damp and you let me know when we're stable again.
Okay. Will do.
13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Rog. Just a reminder you have to disable Charlie and Delta here as you've done in the past. Over.
Okay. I was kind of holding off on this. We're dumping a little waste water now.
Okay. FIDO says he knew it all along. He's - he says he's been very concerned that you've been doing a lot of water dumping.
Okay, Vance. We've got quad C and D disabled.
Okay. Copy, Jack.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
It may be a while before your rates are settled down. We're still observing fairly high rates and deadbanding. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Okay. We've got about three items. First one is, all of your P23 batch - two marks have been evaluated and - Hey, congratulations. Looks real good; they're very happy with it. You're down to 4 arc-minutes on the substellar-point aspect of it, and that's the first thing to mention. The second is, unless you see a need, I don't see any need for you to read back the information we gave you on the solo book and so forth. Do you concur?
Rog. I think I got it. I remembered a lot of it, and so I think with what you gave me and what I remember, I'm pretty sure we got it right.
Okay, and the third item, we - I was just about to call that your rates were stabilized to start the PTC, but it looks like they're jiggling around again from a dump, so we'll stand by some more.
Okay.
No secrets around here.
Say again. Hey, that's right.
I said there's no secrets around here.
Yeah. Big Brother's watching.
13...
I can just see EECOM telling FIDO.
Yes. You really have to watch that pair, all right. By the way, we have a maneuver PAD for you, a fly-by PAD, whenever you're ready to copy.
Okay. Stand by.
Go ahead, Vance.
Okay, maneuver PAD, purpose: fly-by, SPS/G&N; 63385; plus 0.97, minus 0.23; 072:24:33.08; plus 0212.7, minus 0141.7, minus 0254.8; 148, 316, 050; NA, plus 0022.5; 0360.9, 0:53, 0356.3; 33, 352.7, 15.0; NA, NA, NA. Starting with latitude, minus 23.26, minus 165.00; 1147.7, 36172; 166:54:02. Comments, GDC Align stars are 31, Arcturus; and 23, Denebola. R align 288, pitch align 205, yaw align 034; ullage, none; other, burn is SPS docked. LM weight, 33499. Over.
Our PAD as follows: fly-by, SPS/G&N; 63385; plus 0.97, minus 0.23; 072:24:33.08; plus 0212.7, minus 0141.7, minus 0254.8; 148, 316, 050; NA, plus 0022.5; 0360.9, 0:53, 0356.3; 33, 352.7, 15.0; NA, NA, NA; minus 23.26, minus 165.00; 1147.7, 36172; 166:54:02; set stars 31, 23; roll is 288, pitch 205, yaw 034; no ullage; SPS docked; and LM weight, 33499.
Roger. That's correct. Want to verify under Noun 81 that Delta-VX is plus 02127. You cut out right there.
Roger. Delta-VX is 02127.
Roger. And your rates are low. Looks like you can start the PTC.
Okay. In work.
Okay. And when the computer is available, request P00 and Accept and we'll ship you your state vector.
Wait until I get PTC going first, Vance, then we'll give it to you.
Okay.
Okay, Vance. We're P00 and Accept. The computer's yours.
Roger. Here it comes.
You know, somehow, every time I do a set of P23s, you guys uplink me a state vector. I don't think I do too well.
No...
I could get a complex.
No. You know - you know how the FIDOs are. They like to load in their own data, no matter what.
But our state vectors take into account the waste water dumps.
Yeah, that's...
Apollo 13, Houston. It's your computer again.
Okay. Going to Block.
And as a matter of interest, understand that the downrange comparison between the MCC and the computer is within 35,000 feet, and that's on the last sighting, which people think is pretty good.
Okay. Maybe that gives us a little more confidence that if we had to do P23s on the way home, we'd make it.
No doubt about it.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Just info on your PTC, Jim. It's looking very good. Excursions in pitch and yaw are very low.
Okay, thank you. And we're going to change another lithium hydroxide canister now.
Okay.
And, Vance. Has FIDO come up with any observations on the trajectory?
Well, a minute ago, he said that to tell you that he was pacified now after your past comments on his trajectory and so forth, and he hasn't seen any waste water dumps or anything and he's pretty happy.
Okay. I just wondered if we're going to need any more midcourse.
He says, seriously, it's looking probably like you won't have any more.
Hey, that's real fine.
FIDOs never guarantee anything, however.
Yeah. That's right.
Houston, 13. I have the onboard read-out, if you're ready to copy.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. Bat C, 37; Pyro Bat A, 37; Pyro Bat B, 37; RCS A, 97 percent; B, 97 percent; C, 96 percent; D, 97 percent.
Roger. We copy that. Thank you.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Jim, just an item for you and Fred to be thinking about in case you haven't been briefed on this, something that's now being talked about a little bit. These conservative people would like to have you read out the SHe tank pressure when you go into the LM for the LM familiarization at 58 hours. If there's no midcourse-3, and it looks like there's a good chance that there will not be, why, they might want to move the LM familiarization up from 58 to 55 hours. Over.
Okay. If we don't have a midcourse-3, then we'll probably move LM FAM up to 55 hours, in which case we'll go in there and read SHe tank pressure.
Rog. Along with the other FAM stuff, and it's not certain that we want to do this, it's just being talked about, so this is just the information for you.
Okay. This is beginning to sound like the sim that we ran not too long ago.
I don't think it will be a very big deal.
Okay. Houston, 13.
This is Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Vance. Our LM/CM Delta-P is 0.9.
Rog. 0.9.
Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Are you guys hacking into your presleep checklist yet?
Oh, we just finished eating and cleaning up a bit afterwards. Jim's going around collecting debris off of all the inlet hoses. And, I guess you might say we're kind of thinking about getting ready to go to sleep.
Well, I hope you had a good meal.
Yeah, it wasn't too bad.
Sounds like you guys are really living it up, up there. All that music, food. I didn't say drink.
Yes, it is pretty nice. Not bad at all. You're right; you didn't say it. This PTC we're in is a pretty - pretty nice merry-go-round, Vance. Every 10 minutes alternately I get to look at the Earth and the Moon.
You couldn't ask for anything more than that. Just so it isn't so fast you...
No, it's a lot - a lot better. I remember from 8 when they didn't hardly ever get to look at either one.
That's right. They were tumbling about another axis, weren't they.
Yep.
It's pretty cloudy down there tonight. About the only land I can see again is a portion of Australia and Korea and looks like a part of China. Just about clouds covering everything else.
Can you still see that clearly with the naked eye, or do you have to look through a glass?
I can see Australia with the naked eye and the China landmass, but I - It took the monocular to pull out the Korean Peninsula.
How about the Moon? Is it looking very big yet?
No, not - not really. Bigger, but we've got a ways to go.
I understand that they're estimating your pericynthion - lunar pericynthion is now 62 miles.
Well, that's not bad.
That's supposed to be just right.
Yeah.
Okay, Houston; 13.
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. We're into the presleep checklist now. As far as the crew status report, as far as medication goes, we've had no medication. And we're all feeling really good. I've given you the onboard readouts. Jim is chlorinating the potable water now. I'm ready for an E-memory dump whenever you're ready.
Stand by 1 on the E-memory dump, Jack. I think we'll be ready in about a minute.
Okay.
And EECOM says that as soon as you stir your cryos, request you go back to Auto on that one tank.
Okay. We'll do that.
Apollo 13, Houston. We're ready to take your E-memory dump.
Okay. Coming down.
Apollo 13, Houston. Were you trying to call?
Go ahead, Houston.
Houston, 13.
Apollo 13, Houston. We thought you were trying to call. Were you?
I don't believe so unless we inadvertently hit the microphone button.
Must have been some other guy trying to call, Jack.
Just trying to get some words in, eh Jack?
Roger. We saw the Down Voice subcarrier come on. We thought maybe you were trying to call. Sorry. I hope we haven't disturbed you and from where I sit, it looks like you're running a rest home up there. Good night.
We're all going to bed now just after we play the last rendition of 'With Our Eyes on the Stars.'
Okay, Jim. And we'd like you to check your S-Band Normal voice switch, Off.
S-Band Normal, Off.
Houston, 13. We'll be off comm; so if you need us, send a crew alert, please.
Okay, Jim. If we need you, we'll send a crew alert, and we'd like to know who's got the duty tonight on the biomed. Is that you?
Yeah. I'll be on the biomed.
Okay. We copy, and you're spoiling my good record of two watches without saying anything.
Just want to keep you busy, Jack.
You're waking me up.
