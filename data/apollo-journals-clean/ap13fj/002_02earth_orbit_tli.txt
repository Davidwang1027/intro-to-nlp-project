Apollo 13, Houston. Your preliminary orbit down here is 102.5 times 100.3 [nautical miles, 189.8 by 185.8 km], and everything is looking good.
Roger, Houston. And it looks good to be up here again.
I'll bet. [Long pause.]
Apollo 13, Houston. I have your Z torqueing angle. You ready? [Pause.]
Jack is ready to copy, Joe.
Okay. It's plus decimal 26. Over. [Pause.]
Okay, Joe. Plus 0.26.
That's Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Couple minutes to LOS, Jim. Everything is looking real good. Your AOS time at Carnarvon will be 52:36, and we don't have too much of a handle on why the inboard cut off early except that it apparently was an engine problem and not a switch select function. But we're certain that you'll be able to make TLI based on what we're looking at now.
Roger. There's nothing like an interesting launch.
That's right. [Long pause.]
Apollo 13, Houston. Canary LOS in 30 seconds. Request Command Reset, please.
Roger. Command Reset coming on.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Hey, you guys, are you ready? I've done my other item there; I'm ready to give you - [garble].
Well, all right, fine. Let's just get this one done first.
Okay.
What else do you have to do here?
Okay. Going Bit Rate.
Apollo 13, Houston. Request Low Bit Rate, please. Over.
Low Bit Rate.
Okay.
Okay. The pressure's okay?
Yes. Let's see now, Jim, there's one more reading there; you gave me the - you gave me the helium pressure, 4100. What's the manifold pressure on that one?
The manifold pressure is reading about 80.
Eighty? Okay, give me the number 1, then.
Okay, number 1. And helium temperature is 80, helium pressure is 4100, and the manifold pressure is about 100.
Manifold's about 100. Okay.
Okay, Freddo. Have a look - the cabin and suit doing? Before we...
They're both pretty equal, now, at about 5/5.
Okay.
Well, let's - We'll break the [garble]
Okay, let's do it. Freddo, here's your bag.
Okay. Jim.
Okay, for that item, those two I can check off. You got the Z-torquing angle?
Yes.
I've checked the caution and warning; you've done that. We're up - we're up to item 9.
How we doing time line?
We're a little behind, but it's the kind of stuff that we can catch up lickety-split with.
Okay.
Okay. Let me get - make sure I got this item. I want A, Simplex. Hell, it was already there. B to Off. No, it wasn't. It's just a hard switch again. They really fake you out, these switches...
Yes. I've noticed...
...they move so hard.
I've noticed that, Fred.
Compared with the simulator. Okay, let me check item 13 off; I've completed that one. Let's see.
Yes. I've got...
Jack, be careful in your movements now.
Yes. I'm not having any problems so far.
Okay.
PCM Bit Rate is Low. I did the Command Reset in Normal. I'll do it again, just to make sure. I have an A, Simplex, and B, Off. That's great. Jack, could you hand me one thing?
What - what would you like?
One of those spring jobbers, there, I can...
Yes.
...flip across...
I was going to ask you, if you wanted one of those, Fred.
Yes. Okay. Now that'll take care of my checklist for me.
A springy jobber coming up.
Thank you. No, no; you got one of the other ones with the hook?
I got the wrong kind?
Yes. It's a little longer one with the hook.
Are they in the same - They in the same - [garble]?
Now that's a good question.
Well, I'll tell you - Let me - I don't see them down here, now.
Sure enough. It really is zero g.
Well, gentlemen, I'll break out my two gold pens.
The longest Napierian trajectory in the world.
Yes. We had - I had a long boost ride, didn't we?
Man!
Twelve minutes and 30 some seconds.
I'll tell you, gang, I was a little worried for a pinch or two.
When I called, 'Inboard,' I was - It was natural; then I looked at the time...
Yes...
...and I said, 'That's not natural.'
We were 2 minutes early. Five minutes and 32 seconds, if you want to write that down.
Okay, good. Okay, my helmet coming off.
Shoot, if they recorded that...
...(Laughter) Yes...
...it'd be heck.
(Laughter) I know it.
Well, you know, I think I'll just - I'll just let this thing pull right up to the top.
You haven't found that other one, yet, have you?
No, Fred; I haven't...
What are you looking for?
A clamp. Oh...
I think those are down - those are in one of the lower...
Okay. You want to give me that other one back here, I'll see if I - Trouble is, I got no hooks that are the right length apart for my goddamn [garble]. Fiddle with it. I'll just hang on to it tight and [garble].
By golly! Guys!
Hey, that's - All that stuff about the helmets being hard to get into the bag is the truth.
Okay, let's see. At [garble] 52:36, we're going to pick them up over Canaries.
Great...
And, gentlemen, you are now passing the beautiful Atlantic Ocean.
I'm glad we checked PGNCS.
Say, I never thought - You guys want to take a look - look at - Excuse me a second. I'm going to turn out those floodlights. I wanted to show [garble] - When I turn out all the lights in just a second, you can see thunder and lightning on the horizon.
Sure as hell can.
And also, you might be able, if your eyes become accustomed to it - you might be able to see the - the airglow. There, you can. You can see the airglow.
Yes. I sure can.
See that airglow?
I can see that lightning, too.
Oh, I - I won't be able to see [garble]
Hey, that's...
El Scorpio, isn't it?
Yes, but see the - Antares is in the airglow layer.
Yes, it is. Right in it.
And then right below that, way - about a half a degree, that's...
The next star down there?
Yes.
Yes.
So, if you lift the lights, we'll see again.
Okay, I'm ready for the main Reg check, Fred, if you're ready.
Okay. Go ahead. I'll tell you when. [Garble] just call it on.
Okay. Main Reg B going closed. Emergency Cabin Pressure selector 1, Push To Test.
Did you Push To Test?
Yes. There it is.
Good.
Okay.
Good.
Main Reg B valve, Open; A going closed.
Closed. Next step?
Cabin - Cabin Pressure selector 2, Push To Test.
Okay, that's good.
Main Reg valve B ... or A, Open, and Emergency Cabin Pressure selector, closed. Okay, Jim. I got to get to ... to those [garble] here.
Okay.
Okay.
[garble] down there?
Up in L-2, Jack.
Yes, that's where I'm looking.
You're kidding. I thought you said the helmet was tough to get in this bag. Piece of cake. Have you got - have you got one of those big helmets?
Yes - No, I don't think - unless I got a bigger head.
You don't have a Borman special, do you?
No.
We all have Borman specials.
Really?
Yes.
Maybe your damn bag won't fit anymore with that one [garble] have to slip it in this one.
Yes. [garble] a little bit. I got a [garble]
Okay. Got a [garble]?
Yes.
Well, is there anything else we can be doing right now? Like COAS?
Yes.
You can...
Yes.
...you can get out the ORDEAL box, if you could...
Yes...
...could you do that, Jim?
I'm going to try it right now.
That would save me a trip down under there.
Okay, that's right.
Okay. Okay...
You got to watch the time right now for...
Yes.
Okay.
I don't - I got to go stow my water wings. You guys got your water wings on?
No. I don't think I'm going to fiddle with that right now, Jack. They're not in my way.
Yes. I'll trade. We can get that later.
Hell, yes.
Well, I'll tell you what - I blew mine on 8.
Did you?
Yes. But you were the guy that - Jack should take his off. He's the guy moving around.
You're right.
Okay. I'll take mine off.
[Garble] really want [garble].
Man, I'll tell you, that first stage...
[Garble.]
When that shut down, man, I thought I was going through the instrument panel. I'll tell you, that was - I was so surprised [garble] I had heard about it.
I should have warned you.
[Laughter.]
Yes, well. Something else...
Well...
...you got to get into.
[Garble] right in [garble].
Okay, let's see. Confirm normal, we've done that. We've stowed the water wings. Now it's the TSB is the only item left outstanding there.
Okay, I have the ORDEAL in place. Now, do you want the camera bracket?
Yes, you better leave that camera bracket up there.
Yes. Yes, I can feel a little bit of the zero-g effect, a little flushing in the face.
Yes.
Yes, that's that - Your blood rushes to your head because your heart doesn't have anything to pump against.
Yes, I can feel that, too.
Okay, I have the camera bracket.
Okay, have you got the - the ORDEAL mounted? I have...
The ORDEAL is mounted.
...[Garble]...
Okay, Jim. Are you ready to get busy on getting the RADs on the line?
I sure am.
Glycol Reservoir Bypass valve, Open.
Okay, Glycol Reservoir Bypass valve to Open.
Okay, Out valve, Close.
Out valve, Close.
The In valve, Close.
The In valve going Close.
Okay, now we need a little bit of quantity in the Accum - not the Accum, but we need the fuel valve on for about 5 percent on down to 45 percent. That's about what it was in the [garble], too.
Okay, what I'm going to do is...
CapCom said they wanted 50.
...[Garble] the ORDEAL, then. The number 1 ball. Did you check the Verb 82?
Yes, I did. I wrote it down.
Okay.
I did that whole thing.
And we got the secondary RAD leak check to go. We got 'Unstow and mount TSB.'
Yes. I [garble] done that, too.
And I got water wings in my lap here. That's it on that item - that page; it's done. So we're hanging up here. Let me proceed ahead and see what I can. I can do a purge. There are not any left for another 12 minutes or so.
Let me get the...
[Garble.]
I got to get...
EPS monitor check, I can do [garble] I've been looking ahead to see what Jim can do. It says a GDC align somewhere in this thing.
Okay, I'm setting the ORDEAL right now.
Okay, well, that's the next thing you can do is a GDC align. Okay, you may - you may get some Master Alarms here, gang. I'm going to be doing a purge check. I'll just do the...
Fredo.
Yes.
Look what I got.
What have you got?
One with a hook on the end of it.
Beautiful.
Spring jobber-do.
Thank you.
Now, is there anything I can be doing?
I am giving you the sequence camera here, Jim.
Okay.
I tell you, I haven't checked the setting.
How about your optics?
I've got them unstowed. Now. [garble] that'd be 32.
[Garble] camera. Here's the power cable.
Thank you. Okay, 18 millimeter, f:8, and 250th.
Now, let's see. Let me give you a - it's f:8, 250th, 7 feet, 12 frames per second.
Okay. Go.
Magazine A.
Magazine A is on.
Hey, Jack, where'd you find these?
I found it right down in - Fred, in this stowage...
Do you have any longer ones?
No.
(Laughter)
No. It...
But that wasn't quite that long.
Yes, I know they do. And I'll tell you where it is; it's down in...
Okay.
...A-8. Can you make do with that for a minute?
Yes. I [garble].
Until I get - Okay, have you got ORDEAL - You got ORDEAL mounted?
I - I have ORDEAL mounted.
There we go.
Okay...
I got to get...
...right after - When did we insert, gang? Twelve something?
12:32 [garble]
Okay. I'm looking for where I put the first line heater on, so it was roughly about 14 minutes. We've been - we've been 20 minutes. Yes. [garble] Okay [garble].
Don't forget I still got the radiators bypassed here.
Yes. Okay, what I need though, Jim, is to - We got to pump up the - You want to - Let's finish that item. I need to pump up the accumulator a little bit. I mean use the accumulator to - Yes - to get it up to 50 percent.
Okay, you tell me what you want me to do here and I'll...
Can you reach the Prim Accum Fill valve, right there on your left?
I'll try.
Yes, that's the Primary. How are you doing, Jack?
Okay.
My countdown under way already?
Yes. But, you want to have a few [garble]?
Yes.
Okay, I'm putting the cable for you.
Excuse me a second; I want to [garble] the O2 flow. Okay. Looks good. But if we get a Master Alarm, it'll come on with the H2. Okay? Fuel cell 2. O2 flow.
[Garble.]
When it comes up flow, the H2 banks up there like crazy. Looks like the simulator. The O2 isn't like the simulator. Yes, it gets up there real slow. That old H2 - Stand by for another Master Alarm. It banked up there like nothing flat. Okay. They're all back down to...
Before I get the...
...normal.
...TSBs out, can I get P52 [garble] program start?
Yes. Go ahead.
Yes.
Get it to cover one that that doesn't.
Yes. I'll [garble].
[Garble.]
That's the fourth, Jack. Better do that.
Okay. It's all optic tracking. I've done that. Zero [garble] G&N Power Optics, on, up. Optics Mode, Manual. [Garble] Direct [garble] High. OHC, Max right.
Okay, do I have a tool there someplace? Can I use an E tool?
[Garble.]
You got it uncovered?
Got tool E?
Yes, until I get that up for a fit.
Okay [garble].
Now, Fred, what do you want me to do?
Okay, next - next thing is to - [garble] back - page - I need to find the [garble] fuel valve on. You can't take your eye off it. I got him out the window. Is that it? I got the airglow there.
Okay.
Make sure you get the right one, Jim. Primary Accum...
Yes. I got it - I got - I got my - If I can get my hand down there, I got it made.
Let me know when you turn them on. I only need about 5 percent; I don't need much.
Okay. Coming On.
Good. That's good. [garble] Off.
Off.
Okay, let me look a minute, here; I have to stabilize.
[Garble] up there.
Okay. About one more shot.
[Garble.]
[Garble] slowly, that really [garble].
Okay, how's that?
That's good. Off.
[Garble] back down there [garble] go to Off.
It's right at 50, though; the hell with it, that's good.
Is it good?
Yes; that's about 49.9.
Okay.
It is definitely Off, right?
Yes.
ECS RAD Control; let me go to Power. Okay, PRIM Glycol To RADs out, Jim; Normal, push - Normal, push in.
Okay.
Oh, I know - Hey, how about giving me - Do I have G&N Power at 8:21?
Yes, sir.
Okay.
You got it.
Okay.
I'll get it ready for you [garble] stars out there.
I've got a star in the...
Sextant?
...sextant, but I have nothing in the...
Well, it might take a while to do it with the scanning telescope, because your eyes have to get accustomed to it. It might not be where there are stars.
Well, I've got one in the - I've got one in the...
What star did you pick?
24.
24, that's - Gienah. Is it right on in the sextant?
[Garble.]
Okay, while you got the tool and you're over there, Jim, do you think you could get the secondary Rad loop check done?
Yes.
That's the guy way down there, the very...
[Garble]...
We'll run through it, Jack, if you could...
[Garble.]
Mark it [garble] Okay, Glycol To Radiator, Secondary?
[Garble.]
Yes, but it's to - RAD Normal. Let me know when. I'll start my watch.
Hey, there - there we go. Now I got stars. I don't think they [garble] until just now.
Okay, I'm going to take her to Normal now.
Beautiful, gang.
All right.
Oh, I don't know if I did it or not.
You - you turned it?
I don't think so, I think [garble] right in there.
Spica's right in there, you guys.
Okay.
I - You know, I can get down there good, but I'm always on...
Well, you'd know if you got the screw in the slot.
Okay, now.
Okay. Starting my watch. It's on Secondary.
No, it's Normal now.
Okay, you've got to leave it there for 30 seconds.
Okay. Could you tell?
What's that?
Could you tell?
Tell what?
That I'm in Normal?
Yes.
[Garble.] Good old Antares.
Okay, that's it; put it back to close or off or wherever it...
Bypass.
Bypass. Good. [Garble] Bypass?
[Garble] Bypass.
Well, he didn't show anything [garble]...
Okay, how is it? Okay?
Yes. Looks good.
Okay, I'm on page 2-14; coming up to EPS monitor check...
Okay, just be sure you...
...EPS. Checking them off.
Check them all off, and [garble]...
You got to do a GDC align...
I'll do that right now.
You've got the sequence camera bracket and the ORDEAL, right?
And those are all mounted, and we're all running on...
Okay, ORDEAL...
Hey, guys? Sorry.
[Garble.]
Yes. Okay, better record this down [garble]...
I ain't got - I ain't going to let that pass, man...
No?
...[garble] triangle bigger than hell.
I'll give you a gold - gold star.
[Garble] got all that in your book, Jack?
Yes. I'm going to write it on a [garble] here.
Okay.
I'll do a GDC align now, Fred.
Okay. Now I'm here, I'm going to go ahead and [garble] the secondary loop. Okay, Secondary Loop is coming on line, gang; AC-1...
Okay. Do we have to wait for MSFN to torque this?
That's that little extra whining you hear, and it's the Secondary Loop.
Okay.
Okay. [Garble] go to the [garble].
I can see the sludges in the [garble] burn.
Yes.
Damn! Sort of lost him.
Okay. So that one is done, done...
Okay...
...done, done, done to there...
Jim?
Stand by.
Do I need a - to get MSFN? I don't need them to torque here, do I?
I don't think so - Wait - Where are the torquing angles [garble]?
I've got the torqueing angles; let's see - [garble] - and it's 0.162 which is quite a bit less than - [garbled]
Okay, Jack, did you ever get my Main B breaker in down there?
Yes, I did, in your COAS?
Yes.
Main B? I did.
Yes. That's right.
That's done.
And - let me verify that the RADs and REACS CB sticks are out, and - off.
Okay. [Garble.]
Okay. I'll verify the Main Bus Ties are Off...
GDC's aligned. 46 now. How we doing on the time line, Fred?
Let's see, we're not - we're coming up 6 minutes - What we got to do is get the cameras ... get the TV camera out next. We're about fixed.
Okay.
01:05 is when I got to start playing with the TV.
Okay.
After we get our HSK LOS.
[Garble.]
If you have time, I would suggest that you adjust your straps and strap it in again for TLI ... just to make sure you got them okay.
Okay. Still pressing on in here, and Jack's got to do that [garble]; I'll circle it.
Okay, what do you have to do?
The RADs and REAC breakers, six of them, out [garble].
Rad, Reac, Reac, Reac - Okay, I can verify three Rads and three Reacs out.
Okay, good show.
Main A-1 - Main A-2...
Okay. Bus voltage [garble].
And, Jack, you want to put tool E down there on the handhold - toward the handhold?
Yes. I haven't got [garble].
Yes. I think I can get closer than that and [garble].
Yes, that's right [garble].
Okay.
Okay, I've got the horizon out there and I've got the airglow layer [garble].
Okay, and we got the relay bus selected [garble] - I got to get this TSB [garble]. Okay, item 15's done. And that makes one outstanding item, and I've got a couple from a few pages back.
Okay.
Right there. Unstow and mount TSBs - they're in A-1. [Garble] down below. Hey, where do these - these guys go? They go right in the pocket of this L-shaped bag, don't they?
[Garble] water wings.
I thought they went right behind you.
Right there - Yes.
Oh, yes. [Garble] pockets.
Okay. I'm up the [garble] monitor - [garble] look good - H2 flow - [garble].
I got it.
Okay, I ought to be getting down there - [garble]. How you doing, Jack?
Good. Hey, how about that - Do you need - that Secondary RAD valve?
You got it already; okay.
We got the secondary - we made the secondary check; the filters finally came out a little bit...
You did the [garble].
...and the ORDEAL's already out; the COAS is...
You got it running?
...[garble] little COAS [garble].
Hey, Freddo? [Garble] that TSB. Okay?
[Garble.] We're going to need it.
[Garble] a big one. Let's see; where did we stow TSBs? We want to [garble]
Here it is.
Jack, whenever you get time, if you - want to slow down a little bit, well, just come back and we'll take these lifevests off and get this stowed out of the way.
Okay. I'll be ready to do it whenever you...
Once you get one of them in...
How you doing, Jack? [Garble] all right down there?
Oh, yes. No problems yet. [Garble] kind of worried [garble] 12.1 down [garble].
Jim, do you need a TSB?
Well, I wouldn't worry about it now. [Garble] go down yet. You're not getting those breakers; that's what you're forgetting.
The - Okay, now where - those - you want those where?
In front of the L-shaped bag, isn't it?
In front of the L-shaped bag is - Why don't you go down there and help him?
Wait a minute, Jack; you don't go - I don't think you go that way to get through.
I think you come right down here, Jack, but - Yes, there is - there's a [garble]...
Yes, but that's a long, long way to go.
...there's a [garble].
Okay, you do that - and I'm going to get the Hasselblad out for - this.
Okay, now, if my - my hand controller is locked and yours is locked - I'll tell you what, if you can help me scootch over here a second...
Yes.
...I'll try and...
Okay, I'll put my [garble], Jim.
Okay. Okay.
Okay, I want to go back and see what - I've got to get the TV camera and the Hasselblad out, and...
I think we ought to be having AOS, gang; we've got...
56 seconds.
Okay. I - Let me call them.
Look at me, Jack; I show gain.
You show gain?
Yes.
Houston, how do you read 13?
13, Houston. Loud and clear.
Okay, Joe. Everything is going good. We're proceeding on the time line in good fashion. I've got a P52 done. I can give you the torqueing angles.
I'm ready for them, Jack.
Okay. Used Noun 26 - stars 26 and 33. The star angle difference was all balls. Noun 93: minus 067, minus all balls, plus 0.162. The time of torqueing was 45 minutes, 35 seconds.
Ah, well, that sounds marginally acceptable.
For a new CMP, it ain't too bad.
Yeah. Okay, 13. We've got nothing for you at the moment. Everything's looking good. We're looking at your data now.
How you doing?
I got [garble]. You got to get it when you're going by.
Okay.
Yes, I've got - got it in my helmet bag right now.
Oh, okay, good.
Boy, I'll tell you, that really bothers me [garble].
Does it [garble]? Did you put it over far enough?
Yes, that's where it went - when [garble] It's looking good [garble], and I don't think they jettison until [garble].
Oh.
Okay. Now I've got to get the TV camera [garble], Freddo...
Okay.
...[garble].
You want to hand me that book, and I'll take a look in it.
Yes. And also see if I've - all the things that I've done, [garble], because I haven't checked them off a couple of places.
Hey, Fred, what do you want first, TV camera?
Yes. Just one more - Let me get through one more - system.
That's off. That [garble] right down [garble] on the bulkhead.
You get done, you're hooking up the cable. You got to do that part, though. We can't [garble] right there.
All right. And I'll verify the CB power is off...
[Garble] off.
I'm going to go back into the - [garble], Jack; and look at [garble].
Okay.
[Garble.]
Freddo, you - How about a bracket?
Well.
Okay, that's [garble].
Apollo 13, Houston. LOS Carnarvon in about 30 seconds. Honeysuckle on the hour, and verify your S-band is up for Honeysuckle. Over.
That's verified.
Roger.
And, Houston, we're beginning to see a beautiful sunrise here.
Roger that, Jim.
13, Houston through Honeysuckle. [Long pause.]
Apollo 13, Houston through Honeysuckle.
Roger, Houston; 13 here. Reading you loud and clear.
Okay. S-band sounds good, Jim.
[Very weak.] Ah, Houston, 13.
Go ahead, 13.
Would it be okay if I crank up the FM [garble]?
You're coming in weak. I didn't quite copy it.
Would it be okay, Joe, if we crank up the FM after we leave Honeysuckle here?
Oh. Stand by on that one. [Long pause.]
13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
What TV was that? [Pause.] Okay, 13...
Okay, Joe. I just wanted to put on the TV switch at Honeysuckle to tune her up there.
Roger. I'm being prompted, and you've got a Go for that. You can turn it on, go to TV, and we'll see you that way over the States.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Fred, I'll read the PADs, or you read the PADs, or somebody read the PADs.
Hey, can I get a - a TV [garble]?
Oh, yes, Jack. LOS Carnarvon.
Okay. 1:45, 75 [garble] LOS at - [garble].
Okay. 13, Houston. LOS Honeysuckle in about 30 seconds, and we'll see you over the States at 1 plus 28 plus 43. [Long pause.]
Okay, coming up. [garble].
13, Houston. Did you copy your AOS time?
Fred, I'll get them when we get all relaxed. I'll do that [garble].
[Garble.]
Hey, Jack, [garble].
[Garble.]
Yes, I can - yes, I can do it, Freddo. [garble].

Apollo 13, Houston. Over. [No Answer.]
Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Hello there. We thought you were still up there.
And we're just coming up on Baja, and I've got the TV on. Do you want it?
I don't think we require it just yet, Jack, but we'll command it when we're ready. I believe they are dumping the tape now. The booster looks good. The spacecraft looks good on the few minutes' data we've had.
That sounds good.
Jim finally let me look out.
(Laughter) How do you like it? [Pause.]
Chained me to the LEB down there stowing things and unstowing things, and I finally got a chance to look out and see the world. [Long pause.]
Apollo 13, Houston. I have the TLI plus 90, and lift-off plus 8 PADs whenever you're ready. [Long pause.]
Okay. Go ahead with the TLI PAD, Joe.
Okay. This is the TLI plus 90 PAD. SPS/G&N, 63825, minus 1.54, plus 1.32, 004:06:45.53, minus 0491.7, plus 0000.1, plus 6634.0, 180, 228, 001; HA is N/A; HP is plus 0017.9; 6652.2, 7:37, 6626.5, 26, 155.4, 15.7.

Joe, we had a dropout of signal there about midway or about a fifth of the start of your PAD, and Fred didn't get it. We'd like you to start over again. Could you please?
Sure thing. You want the whole thing?
Yes, I think you'd better.
Okay. TLI plus 90: SPS/G&N, 63825, minus 1.54, plus 1.32, 004:06:45.53, minus 0491.7, plus 0000.1, plus 6634.0, 180, 228, 001; N/A; plus 0017.9, 6652.2, 7:37, 6626.5, 26, 155.4, 15.7; Zeta Sagittarii; up, 08.0; right 2.1; minus 22.81, minus 025.00, 1140.7, 34087, 013:32:14. Set stars: Arcturus, Denebola; roll, 044; pitch, 012; yaw, 025; no ullage. Over.
Okay, Joe. That's 63825, minus 1.54, plus 1.32, 004:06:45.53...
Fred, Houston. Stand by 1.
...minus 0491.7, plus 0000.1, plus 6634.0.
Fred, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
That's correct. We'd like you to go the S-Band Aux TV switch to TV, please.
Okay. It's set to TV.
Okay. We're not getting a signal.
Okay. I'll go to Transmit, Joe.
Okay. You can continue reading back.
Okay. Roll, 180; pitch, 228; yaw, 001; N/A; plus 0017.9, 6652.2, 7:37, 6626.5 and I missed sextant shaft; - trunnion - trunnion, 15.7, Zeta Sagittarius, up, 08.0; roll 2.1; minus 22.81, minus 00 - correction, minus 025.00, 1140.7, 34087, 013:32:14. Set stars: Arcturus and Denebola; roll align, 044; pitch, 012; yaw, 025; no ullage.
Roger, Fred. Readback correct. The sextant star is 26, and the shaft is 15.54. Over.
Okay. Sextant star 26 and 15.54.
Roger. And we have a picture now; however, it's moving around quite a bit, if you could hold the camera a little steadier. And I have your...
...Okay, Joe. There's nothing but clouds outside, and when we get some land down there coming up, I'll switch back to the window, I thought I'd just show you Jim here, to make sure he's still here.
Okay; real fine. We had a good picture of Jim there for a minute. I have the Lift-off plus 8 PAD, Fred. If you're ready.
Go ahead, Joe.
Okay. GETI, 008:00; Delta-VT, 7835; longitude, minus 165; GET 400K, 022:36. Over.
Okay. 008:00, 7835, minus 165, 022:36.
Okay, then. And I have TLI PAD for you.
Okay. I'm ready.
TLI: 2:26:05, 179, 108, 000, 5:47, 10416.9, 35587, 358, 139, 320, 302, 319, 040. Ejection time, 4 plus 01 plus 00. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. TLI: 2 plus 26 plus 05, 179, 108, 000, 5 plus 47, 10416.9, 35587, 358, 139, 320, 302, 319, 040, and ejection time, 4 plus 01 plus 00.
Roger, Fred. Readback correct, and we're getting a nice color TV picture now. If you have any commentary to go with it. [Pause.]
Okay, Joe. I'll tell you, I'm just trying to figure out where we are here.
That's your job, not mine.
[Garble]. You know, I've just been up out of the LEB for a short time here, and I'm trying to find out which country we're over.
I have to keep telling Jack that the blue stuff down there is water.
I'll give you a hint. You're in the western hemisphere. [Long pause.]
Okay, Joe. It appears like that we've crossed out into the Gulf of Mexico here, and I've got a peninsula or an island that's down there. I don't know whether you can see it. [Long pause.]
Roger, Jack. We see that. Of course, there's a lot of cloud cover and you see it more clearly than we do, but it does look like the Earth, not the Moon. [Long pause.]
Apollo 13, Houston. We've had LOS MILA now. Thank you very much. [Long pause.]
Apollo 13, Houston. Request P00 and Accept for a state vector. Over.
Roger, Houston. We're in P00 and Accept.
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. The computer is yours, Jim.
Thank you, [garble].
And you are Go for TLI. Huntsville reports that you have a 6-second propellant pad which is 3 seconds more than a 3-sigma case; so you're good on consumables. The IU is so good that we're not going to update it. The only change we have for you is in the TLI checklist. At 57 minutes, where you slew the FDAI to 18 degrees, we recommend 20 degrees there, and we recommend that you look for 8 degrees instead of 6 degrees at ignition. The S-IVB is riding on the top of its deadband.
Understand; and just out of curiosity, was that engine-out to use up more S-IVB fuel?
The engine-out did cause you to use more S-IVB fuel - about a 10-second-longer burn; but you're still Go.
Okay. Thank you. [Pause.]
And, 13, Houston. We're ready to support pyro arm and docking probe extension whenever you're ready. [Pause.]
Okay, Houston. Docking probe has been extended and all indications are nominal. We're down to Pyro Arm now and we're getting ready.
Okay, Jim. [Pause.]
Okay, Houston. My circuit breaker's armed - or closed; Sequential Logic, two, on and up and we're standing by [garble].
Okay, 13. You're Go for pyro arm. [Long pause.]
And, Houston, 13. Were you reading us?
Roger, 13. Go ahead.
Roger. We have our Sequential Arm circuit breakers in and our Sequential Logic, two, on and up and we are just standing by for your confirmation for a Go.
Sorry, 13. You didn't copy. You are Go for pyro arm. Over.
Okay; fine. Thank you.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
About 2½ minutes to LOS, Jim, and your AOS at Carnarvon will be 2 plus 25 plus 50. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. AOS at Carnarvon 2 plus 25 plus 50.
That's affirm.
Apollo 13, Houston. LOS in about 1 minute. At LOS we'd like Command Reset and then Normal.
Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston through Carnarvon.
Okay, Joe. Read you loud and clear. We're sitting here monitoring time base 6. You can see countdown; we're 20 seconds away.
Okay. We're just starting to get data, and everything still looks good to us.
Hey, Joe. At 2 hours and 12 minutes, the O2 Flow High light came on, and it's been pegged high ever since, so it's been on about 14 minutes now.
Roger, 13. We're looking at it.
Time base 6.
Copy. Time base 6. [Long pause.]
Okay. Apollo 13, Houston. You have a Go for all systems, and the O2 Flow High check is nominal with the Waste Tank Vent open at this time, and it's no sweat.
Okay. Just wanted you all to check it for me.
Okay. We did.
Thank you.
Apollo 13, Houston. We'll be losing data from Carnarvon in about 1 minute. We'll probably have voice through ARIA. Everything is hunky-dory, and we'll be listening for you to tell us how the burn goes.
Okay, this is 13. We're standing by, too.
Apollo 13, Houston through ARIA. Just a comm check. Over.
Reading you clear [garble].
Okay, Jim. It's not the best, but we're reading you.
Roger.
[Garble] now?
[Garble.]
[Garble] 59 - [garble].
What was this [garble]?
[Garble.]
[Garble] and what are your FDAI angles [garble]?
[Garble.]
Okay, 59 ...[garble]?
[Garble.]
Okay, I've got 59 and 30. How's that? Okay?
[Garble] the burn, [garble].
[Garble.]
Okay. [Garble] burning, Jim.
Okay. Here, I'll get out the [garble].
[Garble.]
[Garble.]
Burning!
Okay. Watch that...
Ignition, Houston.
Copy that, Jim. Good deal.
Okay. [Garble] pitching her down a little bit, right here.
[Garble.] There you go.
[Garble.] Is that all right?
Okay, you watch the - trajectory thrust?
Yes.
[Garble] burned 14-second velocity VI and [garble].
[Garble]?
It's right on VI; we're right on VI.
Got both [garble] up?
We got to leave these open.
Okay, 01:30. Three minutes and...
0.75.
[garble].
Right on - right on; [garble] little bit higher [garble].
[Garble.]
[Garble.]
Watch the [garble].
Okay, Jim, it's 2 minutes [garble].
Everything's okay so far.
Houston; Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay; we got 02:30 coming [garble], Jim?
Right on [garble]. Right on H-dot; we're right on 8.
They are off - at 38.
Three minutes...
[Garble.]
All right.
3:30, Jim. 3.4.
3.4. Okay.
Okay. We're right on.
Okay. [Garble].
Okay, at 4 minutes. [Garble].
[Garble]?
Okay.
Okay, we'll hold this down; we've got a little vibration.
[Garble].
Yes.
No, [garble] thousand, 200 [garble].
[Garble].
We're looking at 4 point [garble]...
4 point [garble], okay.
Right on at 30. A little bit high.
And, Houston, we're noticing a little vibration during this burn.
Houston; Roger.
Five minutes [garble] 4.6.
Okay.
[Garble] a hundred [garble].
Okay.
H-dot is a little high [garble].
Okay.
5:30 - 5 point - [garble] the same countdown, Jack, and then start counting up.
Okay.
[Garble.]
[Garble] VI [garble].
[Garble.]
Five seconds.
Five [garble], okay.
Better get [garble].
5.0. [Garble.]
5...
4, 3, 2, 1 - 1, 2, 3, 4...
Okay.
Engine Off. [Garble].
[Garble] is three-quarter overburn.
It's off. Engine off.
Houston. Copy. Engine off. [Long pause.]
Freeze the DSKY.
I did.
Okay, and now we'll [garble].
Okay, Jim, it's SCS TVC Servo Power 1, Off.
It's Off.
PCM Bit Rate, I got Low. EMS Mode - Wait, let Jack get it. Minus 3.0.
Boy, beautiful.
You got that, Jack?
Yes.
EMS Mode to Standby?
[Garble.]
EMS Mode to Standby.
Standby. Function, Off.
Function, Off.
Sequence Pyro Arm, two, Safe.
Sequence Pyro Arm, two, Safe.
That's a [garble], too.
Okay.
Okay. Sequence - FDAI 1, Inertial.
FDAI 1 going Inertial.
And lock your hand controller.
Hand controller is locked.
Okay, Jack, you clean up the DSKY and eventually get the P00.
13, Houston. We'll have you through Hawaii in 3 minutes.
Roger. Through Hawaii in 3 minutes.
Okay.
Okay...
So we're standing by until Jack gets through that - jazz...
How does that look, Jack?
Looks good.
Okay, it's a Verb 66 Enter, Jack, after you get - after you get the P00. Wait until you get that.
[Garble.]
Okay, now you all switch - En route, Jack, you got to do a couple of things.
In Hawaii, we'll get their [garble]...
Okay. You - let me put this - put this up under here...
Okay.
And we'll have to switch comm carriers so I can take this suit stuff off.
Yes. We'll have to take the suit power off.
Yes. And we'll...
And what would be nice for you to do, Jack, if you can...
Okay. What do you want me to do?
... is, first of all, Waste Stowage Vent valve, Closed.
Okay. I'll do that right now.
I've got the High Gain Power, Off, and I'm getting - I've got those two breakers in on 225. Waste Stowage Vent valve is Closed.
Closed.
Now, get the TV camera out from under there, will you?
Okay.
And I'll be dickering with that...
[Garble]...
[Garble.]
TV camera's...
Thank you. May as well get me the monitor and all that jazz.
I'll go do that now.
And the bracket. I'll be fiddling and getting this baby ready.
One bracket.
Thank you.
Okay, Freddo, now here's the monitor.
Okay. Got a - Thank you. Okay. [Garble.]
Okay. Okay. The [garble] are off - done.
Stand by. [Garble].
It's funny.
Okay, my Suit Power's going Off...
...[Garble] you got comm...
Apollo 13, Houston through Hawaii. Over.
Roger, Houston.
13 through Hawaii. How do you read?
13, Houston. You're weak but clear; it'll probably get better in a second. We're standing by for the burn report.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Jack, we need the burn report just briefly.
Okay.
Here, I'll get it.
And 13, Houston. The Booster reports that everything looks good with the S-IV.
Sounds good, Houston. The ride was very nominal. We a little vibration, though, during most of the run.
Okay. We copied your call on that, Jim.
Okay, Joe. The DSKY read 35560, plus 04445, plus 01769, and Delta-VC was minus 3.0.
Roger. You can't ask for much better than that. How about the burn time? Did you notice?
Okay. On my trusty watch, I had about 3¾ seconds long.
Okay. Copy that.
