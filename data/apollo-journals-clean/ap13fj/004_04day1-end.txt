Ah, Houston; 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Is the S-IVB doing something different now?
Well, I don't know. It should be - let's see, it should have started the LOX dump at least quite a while ago. I guess that's complete. Why do you ask, Fred?
I'm looking out window 5 at what I think is the S-IVB, and I'm seeing what looks to be double plumes, growing in - it's two very narrow bands, maybe about 3 degrees, that are streaming out from it. And then there is a less dense band that covers maybe a 40-degree swath through the sky that continues out, also, in two directions.
Hey, Joe, what it looks like, kind of, is if you pull up behind a guy that's pulling a contrail, and you get in his contrail, like he's going away from you - there's a long contrail.
Okay; stand by. Let me see what Frank's got to say about that.
Except we're between - Looks like we're between two contrails, one guy above and one below.
Roger. [Pause.]
It's a very pretty sight. [Long pause.]
Okay, 13; Houston. The booster says that the propulsive dump is concluded; he now has the nonpropulsive vents open and what you see is a normal phenomenon and it should go on for another 5 minutes or so.
Okay.
And, while I've got you, 13, at your convenience, we'd like to have the results of the EMS bias tests that you did pre-TLI and pre-Sep.
Stand by.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, Joe. The TLI - the Delta-V no-bias test prior to TLI, we had a 0.8, and post-TLI, it was 1.0.
Okay, Jack. Copy that. Thank you very much. Incidentally, as your tracking gets better and better, the size of MCC-2 is getting lower and lower and figures to be somewhere between 10 and 30 feet per second now.
Sounds good.
Yeah, sure does. [Long pause.]
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Okay. We have a PTC REFSMMAT ready, if you're ready to go P00 and Accept, we'll stick it in there.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay. I'm P00 and Accept, Joe.
Okay. Roger that.
Apollo 13, Houston. We'll have a handover in half a minute or so. You may get a momentary loss of strength.
Okay, Joe.
Apollo 13, Houston. The computer is yours. Over.
Okay. Going to Block.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. Do you copy 13's torqueing angles on the P52?
13, Houston. Leave them up just a second, and we'll get them down.
13, Houston. Okay. We got 'em. [Long pause.]
Okay. The time of torqueing was 5 hours, 30 minutes and 40 seconds.
Roger. We copy.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. I just got all hooked up to get in my comm system here, and I just wanted to check out. I've got my suit stowed, a few other odds and ends done, and I'm back in business again.
Okay. Good deal. We're kind of hanging loose down here. I've got a Lift-off plus 15 PAD. There's no hurry to read it up, so let us know when you're ready.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. Go ahead with the PAD.
Okay, Jim. Lift-off plus 15 PAD: GETI, 015:00; Delta-VT, 5622; longitude, minus 165; and GET 400K, 047:04. Over. [Pause.]
Okay, Houston. Lift-off plus 15: GETI, 015:00; 5622; minus 165; 047:04. Is that correct?
That's right, Jim.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Rog. We'd like to have the Attitude Set switch back to GDC, if you're finished with your align. It gives G&C down here a telemetry problem.
Yeah; okay.
Thank you. [Pause.]
I'm just going to give them one more align here.
Okay. No rush.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Rog. Would you please verify or tell us what S-band antenna configuration you're in, please?
Okay. Stand by. [Long pause.]
We're in High Gain.
Roger. Stand by a minute, Jim. Our signal strength is getting a little low. We may have a recommendation. [Pause.]
13, Houston. Are you in Manual or Auto in High Gain?
Stand by. [Pause.] We're in Auto Track, Joe, and High Gain.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. You copy 13? [No answer.]
Hello, Houston; Apollo 13. Over. [Pause.]
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Hey, were you copying my P23 results?
That's affirmative, Jack. We followed you through the whole thing. You're ahead of schedule, hey.
Okay.
And, Joe, we confirmed there's no midcourse-1. Over.
That is affirmative as far as I know. Let's get a final check on it, Jim.
Okay. Because we're standing by. We want to do a fuel cell purge and a waste water dump.
Okay, Jim. We confirm that there will be no midcourse-1.
Okay. Sounds good. [Long pause.]
And, 13, Houston. You can go ahead with the purge and dump at your discretion.
Roger, Houston. What we're going to do is, we're going to get rid of Fred's suit here. Fred's suit has been right in the commander's slot here for the last half hour. So we're going to try and get it stowed.
Okay.
You did a pretty good job.
Apollo 13, Houston. We'll have a handover in about 1 minute.
Hello, Houston. Apollo 13.
Roger, Jim. We'll have a handover from Hawaii to Goldstone in about 30 seconds.
Say again, Houston.
We'll be handing over from Hawaii to Goldstone in a few seconds. You may get a temporary loss of comm.
Okay, Houston. We've got a whole bunch of noise, too.
Okay. Houston, 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Hey, Joe. Do you want to dump waste water down to 25 percent. Is that right?
That's affirm.
Okay, in work.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Do you know we're also purging fuel cells O2 now.
Okay, Jack.
Okay, Houston. The fuel cell purge and waste water dump are complete.
Roger, Apollo 13. And this is your relief CapCom shift on now.
Well, good evening, Vance.
Boy, you sure made it back fast.
Yes. You guys had a beautiful launch, there. Really nice. [Pause.]
Could you follow it all the way up, Vance?
No, I didn't see staging. It was too hazy for that, but we could see it for a few miles anyway. [Pause.]
I'll tell you, it's sure an interesting ride.
Right.
Houston, Apollo 13.
Rog. Go ahead, Jim.
Roger. We're at that stage now where we're going to take some Earth weather photography. If you're standing by, I have the camera aimed at the Earth right now, and I'll give you a mark when I take the first picture.
Roger. We copy, Jim. We'll be standing by for the mark. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. 3, 2, 1...
Mark.
Roger, copy. [Long pause.]
And Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
For the PTC, recommend that you disable quads A and B. Over.
Okay. Disable quads A and B, will do; and soon as Jack gets finished thrashing around, we'll be going to that PTC mode.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. We're starting PTC. We're disabling quads A and B now.
Roger, Apollo 13. Houston copies.
Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Jim, we'd like to verify that the High Gain is secured, that the S-band antenna is on Omni, and Omni B should be the right antenna. Over.
Okay. You want the High Gain secured and you want the Omni on Omni Charlie, huh? Or Baker?
That's affirm. And this'll be maintained in the PTC.
Okay. [Pause.]
And the High Gain angles for stowage - or for stowing - are pitch minus 52, yaw 270.
Houston, Apollo 13.
Roger. Go ahead.
Stand by for another Earth weather picture. I'll give you a mark.
Okay. Standing by, Jim. [Long pause.]
3, 2, 1 ...
Mark.
Houston copies. [Long pause.]
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Houston here. Your rates look very stable. It looks like your rates are damped out completely here. As far as we can see, it would be alright to start the PTC.
Okay. We'll give it a try.
Hello, Houston. This is 13. How do you read?
13; Houston. Loud and clear. [Pause.] 13, Houston's reading loud and clear. How do you read?
Okay. And do you have any estimate, Vance, on how long we'll be charging battery B?
Stand by 1, Fred. [Long pause.]
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
We'll be charging for 4½ to 5 hours yet, Jim.
Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Aah, Fred, recommend that, when your window comes around facing the Earth again, that you catch another one of those pictures, and at the same time, you should probably start PTC again. We might have sent a confusing bit of info up to you. The 'disable two quads' only applies to an early step in the procedure. We didn't mean that for the latter part of the procedure where we have the statement 'enable all jets.' Over.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 13. [Pause.]
Apollo 13, Houston. Go ahead.
Vance, Fred said that you had some more information about PTC and a different way of establishing it or something, huh?
Rog. Referring to the procedure on G/8-2, if you have that open, I'll tell you what we had to give you. [Pause.]
Okay. Stand by and I'll get it out.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay. Go ahead, Vance.
Okay. On checklist G/8-2 under step 5, there's a statement, 'disable all jets on two adjacent quads,' and that's what we were referring to when we called up saying 'disable quads A and B.' So that's all fine; however, going down now to step 7 where it says 'enable all jets,' we hoped that you didn't think we meant leave A and B disabled there. In that case, it's as written. All jets should be enabled. Over.
Okay. Our checklist has 'all jets' scratched out, and it says 'enable couples on all axes.' So what we'll do is - we'll re-establish this thing and come down to that step 7, and we'll enable all jets. That means enable quads A and B. Is that right?
That's affirm. You'll have A, B, C, and D enabled for step 7.
Okay, real fine. I'll start on it now.
Okay. Understand you're going to re-establish it. [Long pause.]
And Vance, on that picture, I was all set to shoot it just a little before you called, and the Earth hasn't showed up in the window yet. I don't know if we got too far off the bellyband or what.
Roger. Copy, Fred. [Long pause.]
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Roger. On the photo, you'll probably have to re-establish the attitude for PTC and then whenever it comes into the window again, why we'll just be standing by for the photo. [Pause.]
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Roger, You're coming in a little weak. Have a recommended roll rate for this PTC, if you could copy.
Ah, go ahead.
Okay. Recommend that you put in R1 the following: 03750, and that should give you exactly a rate of 0.3 degrees per second. Over.
Okay, 03750. Is plus or minus our choice? [Pause.]
Roger. The same direction you rolled last time, which I believe is plus.
Okay.
Hey, Vance, would you monitor our rates and kind of give us an idea of when you think they're stable enough to start PTC.
Rog, Jack. We'll take a look and let you know as soon as they look stable enough.
Okay. I've got quads A and B disabled here.
Roger. [Pause.]
Have they come up with an idea of how much fuel I used on the docking and also the P23 session at 5 hours or 6 hours. [Pause.]
I think we can give you something. Stand by a minute.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. It's looking good so far as RCS consumables are concerned, Jack. You're standing about 20 pounds above the curve right now. Looking at the TD&E, you expended 65 pounds or - Stand by - 55 pounds, correction on that.
How much?
And 14 pounds on P23s. You used a little more out of quad A than out of the others.
Okay. Thanks, Vance.
Rog.
Hey, could you say again the TD&E fuel? We've got a different - we all heard different things.
I said 65 and then corrected that to 55 pounds.
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim. Your rates look good. It's okay to start the roll again, if you'd like.
In work.
Hello, Houston, 13.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 13.
Apollo 13, go ahead.
Okay. Ready for a little count here, Vance, and I'll shoot another picture. We found the Earth again.
Okay. We'll be standing by, Fred.
Okay. 3, 2, 1...
Mark.
Roger. Copy.
Hey, Houston, 13.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. Stand by for a mark on another picture.
Okay. Standing by, Fred. [Long pause.]
3, 2, 1...
Mark.
Okay, we got it.
Apollo 13, Houston. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, Houston here. Two items: first of all, your PTC is looking very good and it should carry you through the night; second point, have a procedure to give you, if you're ready to copy. We'd like to set three bits in the computer, and I'll explain why. [Long pause.]
Go ahead, Vance, we're ready to copy.
Okay. The procedure is as follows: Verb 25, Noun 07, Enter; 1331, Enter; 7, Enter; and Enter. Explanation as follows. During the P23s, there was one time when Verb 37 was entered into the computer at about 16 seconds after the Optics Zero switch was flicked to Zero. This is a very uncommon anomaly in that, if you do this during - point - four tenth of a second interval at around 16 seconds after you zero the optics, some OPT-mode bits are reset; and this would mean that, if you had a OCDU fail, it wouldn't be indicated; so all this procedure is doing is setting these three bits back again where they should be.
Okay, Vance, and I guess I'll try to be slower on that Verb 37.
Yes. Actually slower or faster, either one, I guess. Well, yeah, slower. It's a very unusual thing to have that happen.
Okay. And, Houston, stand by for a mark on another picture.
Rog. Standing by.
3, 2, 1...
Mark it.
Roger. We copy, Fred. [Long pause.]
Okay, Vance; we've completed that procedure, and let me know if everything was okay. [Pause.]
Okay, thank you. We'll let you know if anything isn't okay. I'm sure it's good now. [Pause.]
Tell G&C and Guido thanks a lot for keeping good track of me, there.
Rog. They're right on the ball. [Long pause.]
And, 13, Houston. If you would like, we can let you know about every 2 minutes before the Earth should be coming into your window. We think we've got it pegged down pretty well now, and you won't have to look for it so much. Do you want that?
Yeah. That would be fine, Vance.
Okay. [Pause.]
And, 13, Houston. Guido says the bits are reset - rather, are set.
Okay, thanks much.
[Music.]
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
It's time for Fred to start looking for the Earth, should be coming by in about a couple of minutes.
Okay. He's got his head out there right now.
Yeah. You've got that pretty well pegged, man. There it be.
Doesn't that give you confidence?
Yeah. I guess so. In a minute, you're going to hear my kitchen timer ding, and that also says the Earth is there.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay. Stand by, Vance, for our countdown. [Pause.]
3, 2, 1...
Mark.
Roger. We copy.
[Music. Hall of Montezuma] [Long pause.]
Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Rog. We're enjoying Fred's music there. [Pause.]
Yeah, [garble] up here.
Yeah, I kind of like it too, Vance. [Pause.]
Yeah, we - we didn't hear much of it, though.
Houston, Apollo 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Vance, we did another EMS null bias test and the - it went from 100.0 to 101.8 in 100 seconds.
Roger. We copy.
13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Jack, like to verify, was that 100 to 100.8 or 101.8?
101.8.
Rog.
It was plus 100 to plus 101.8.
Rog.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
The Earth's coming up in the window again in 1 to 2 minutes.
He's got it. You're right again. [Long pause.]
Okay, stand by for a mark here.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Okay, ready? 3, 2, 1...
Mark.
Roger, copy your mark. [Long pause.]
Apollo 13, Houston. We have a CSM state vector to send you. Request P00 and Accept at your convenience. [Long pause.]
Okay, Vance. There's P00 and Accept.
Okay, it's coming up.
13, the computer's yours again.
Okay, going back to Block.
Rog.
Looks like picture-taking time again. [Long pause.]
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Okay, Earth should be coming into view.
Okay. I got it. [Long pause.]
Okay. Stand by, Vance. 3, 2, 1...
Mark.
Roger. We got it. [Long pause.]
Earth starting to look pretty small now?
Well, looking at here, Vance, it's hard to be convinced it's even the Earth. All we see is water and clouds. [Pause.]
Well, I guess that's what we want. We want pictures of weather, right, clouds.
Yeah, about half of it's covered with clouds.
[Music.]
[Faint.] Houston, 13.
Houston, Apollo 13.
This is Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Vance. Are you copying the torqueing angles of the P52 option 3? [Long pause.]
That's affirm - that's affirm, but stand by.
Okay. [Pause.]
Okay. We've got 'em. Go ahead and torque 'em, Jack.
Okay. That was stars 20 and 27 and star-angle difference is five balls, and the time at torquing would be 10 hours, 40 minutes, 15 seconds.
1 hour [means 10 hours], 40 minutes and 15 seconds; 20 and 27 stars; and five balls. Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Time to look out your window for us again.
Lo and behold.
Okay. It's 3, 2, 1...
Mark.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, we're coming up on a handover between sites. You might lose comm momentarily.
Okay. Understand handover, we might lose the comm.
Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
You should have the Earth coming into view here shortly.
Okay. [Pause.]
We got a new CapCom now. [Long pause.]
No, I changed my voice. [Long pause.]
3, 2, 1...
Mark.
Roger. Copy.
That was negative, Houston. Say again.
We got your mark, Jim.
Okay.
Hey, you still there, Vance?
Rog. Go ahead.
I guess the world really does turn. I can see some of my landmasses now. It must be Australia down near the bottom and I guess we haven't really figured out what's over the - to the left. It must be some part of Asia. China, probably.
Hey, maybe the fact that you verified that the Earth really turns, we can call this Haise's Theory, huh? [Pause.]
Very good, Vance. Very good.
It's looking good for you, Vance.
No, seriously. Very interesting, we can see on the map now that you're between Guam and Hawaii and a little bit north, and you're almost out 60,000 miles [110,000 km].
Yeah. I just did a P21 and we had 55,900 [103,500 km]. [Pause.]
Okay. That's pretty good.
I'll let you look at it again here. [Pause.]
Incidentally, we're looking at a replay of your TD&E stuff here and the TV looks pretty good. First chance some of us had had to see it. [Long pause.]
Okay, Vance. In R1, there's our altitude in tens of miles, 55,290 [102,400 km]. [Pause.]
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Looking at our computations back here, we show you about 55,450 [nautical miles, 102,690 km] and going out rapidly now.
Well, HAL might be a little bit off.
Okay.
We have a sign underneath our LEB DSKY that 'my name is HAL.'
I can't imagine how that got there. [Pause.] Just remember, you have to be nice to HAL.
We will. [Pause.]
I think this PTC's going to work out good. I been watching it here for the last hour here.
Good. It's looking good here. [Pause.]
Good Lord!
Houston, 13.
13, Houston. You're very weak. Please repeat.
Vance, to our calculations, we have taken about 10 Earth window photography pictures. I see nothing coming up here except to close the waste stowage vent here in a little while. I was thinking about getting squared away to bed down for the evening pretty soon. [Pause.]
Okay. That sounds good, Jim. FAO here would like to request just one more picture before you bed down, if you don't mind.
Okay. We'll come through with one more picture.
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
A couple of items, Jim. The first is, the time for closing the waste stowage vent is 12:24. If you turn in before that time, why it's okay as far as we're concerned down here to close it before that time, just before you go to bed. The second point, we have some results on the P23s, and, if Jack's interested, we could give him the corrected altitudes we're getting, and so forth.
Yeah. I sure am, Vance. [Pause.]
Okay. This is preliminary results, but it will give you some indication. Corrected altitude is turning out to be 17 plus or minus 4 kilometers, and the fact that it's plus or minus 4 kilometers indicates that you're being very consistent in judging the altitude. The effective altitude is turning out to be 10 plus or minus 12 kilometers. Comments are that, as I said before, you're being consistent on the horizon selection. The substellar point error is averaging 15 arc-minutes and if you could hold the rates to a minimum, you might shoot for 5 arc-minutes. That's the only comment there. Over.
Okay. We'll try doing it better next time.
But, they're real satisfactory. [Pause.]
Okay. Thanks, Vance.
Rog.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jack, this is the last time for the Earth coming into view in about 1 to 2 minutes.
Okay. I got my photographer looking out there.
Okay. [Long pause.]
13, Houston. I just corrected. Actually, the Earth will come into view more times. It's just that we're [garbled] to the photography. Over.
Okay.
3, 2, 1...
Mark.
Roger. We copy, and could you give us the frame number on that last picture, please?
Okay. We've been writing them all down, Vance, as we went, but that one turned out to be 29.
Roger. Twenty-nine, Fred. [Pause.]
Okay, Jack says I can't read the counter very well. It should be 28 based on our start frame.
Correction to 28. [Long pause.]
13, Houston. Understand, though, the number showing that you read on the camera was 28. Is that affirm?
Yes. The readability of that thing is like, you know, half a frame one way or the other; so, 28, I think, is a good number.
Okay.
Roger. Houston copies. [Pause.]
I'll have to not wear it out before Jack gets there.
Sounds like that music's a pretty nice thing to have on a long voyage.
Yeah, you're right.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Fred, did you get any Master Alarms up there about 5 or 10 minutes ago? Folks thought they saw some here and they were curious about it.
Ah, yeah. We got another O2 Flow High on - I guess it was about 5 minutes ago.
Okay.
I think, Vance, what - what the people down there might have been seeing is our testing.
Rog. Testing the Caution and Warning? [Pause.]
Yeah. We were rigging a little siren device over the Master Alarm, and we were running a test on it.
Okay. Good enough. And anytime you're ready to copy, I've got a PAD, P37 block data.
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Okay. Go ahead, Vance.
Okay. P37 block data, starting with GETI. 025:00, 5119, minus 165, 071:08; 035:00, 7733, minus 165, 070:36; 045:00, 6208, minus 165, 094:52; 060:00, 5993, minus 165, 118:53. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. Stand by 1 minute. [Long pause.]
Okay. 025:00, 5119, minus 165, 071:08; 035:00, 7733, minus 165, 070:36; 045:00, 6208, minus 165, 094:52; 060:00, 5993, minus 165, 118:53.
Rog. That's all correct. [Pause.]
Okay.
Houston, 13.
Roger. Go ahead.
We're starting our presleep checklist and no medication.
Okay. The Doc says very good. [Long pause.]
And, Houston, is there any onboard readouts that you don't have from us. [Pause.]
Stand by 1. We need the LM/CM Delta-P for one thing, and I'll check back in a minute with the others.
Okay. And we still have the vent valve open. We'll close it one of the last things and I'm looking at LM/CM Delta-P right now and I see 0.5 in psi indicated.
Roger. Five-tenths. [Long pause.]
13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Only other readouts we need are those on page 3-13 of the Flight Plan. Bat C, Pyro Bat A, Pyro Bat B, RCS A, B, C, and D readings, and DC Indicator select Main A or B.
Okay. Stand by. [Long pause.]
And, Vance, we're still charging Bat B. Did you want to dispense with that in a few minutes? [Pause.]
Stand by on that, Fred. [Pause.]
Okay, Vance, I've got your readouts on page 3-13 of the Flight Plan.
Okay. Ready to copy.
Okay, Bat C is 37, Pyro Bat A is 37, Pyro Bat B is 37; RCS A, 94 percent; B, 95 percent; C, 93 percent; D, 96 percent. [Pause.]
Roger. Copy that. [Long pause.]
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. In answer to the battery-charging question, I calculate it should be fully charged at 12:35. Play that one, though, the same as the waste vent. If you want to do it earlier because you're turning in, why that's fine with us.
Okay, we'll continue on with a few other things we got to get done, and just before turning in, we'll check with you, and you can remind us then.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 13. Give me a call when you're ready for E-memory dump.
This is Houston, 13. You were weak. Please repeat.
Okay, Vance, give me a call when you're ready for our E-memory dump. [Long pause.]
Okay, 13. We're not quite ready yet. We'll give you a call when we're ready.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay, Vance. I understand you're ready.
Negative, GUIDO isn't quite ready yet.
Okay. I thought I heard you call us.
But we're ready now, Jack, so GUIDO says he's ready to take it.
On the way down.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 13.
13, Houston. Go.
Okay, Vance. Requesting clearance now to turn the vent valve back to Close again, and also the battery charge, Off.
Roger. That's fine with us, Jim. Proceed.
Okay, we'll do that.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
We think the spacecraft's looking in good shape. Nobody has any comment down here before you hit the hay.
Okay. How do they think we stand on the way of consumables so far? [Pause.]
You're looking in good shape in all respects - consumables-wise.
Okay. Real fine.
13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Just the last comment, Jack. Would you clear Hal, please, so he doesn't burn his lights out there tonight?
