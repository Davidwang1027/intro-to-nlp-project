Aquarius, Houston. Over.
All right, go ahead, Vance.
Okay, Fred. Two - three things. First thing is we need a docking angle check as soon as you can conveniently get it. Second point, you're free to drink all the descent stage water you want, if that wasn't clear before. And the third point, if you have a piece of paper, stand by to get writer's cramps. We have something to give you here.
Okay. You want the - again a look at the docking tunnel index?
Why don't you go ahead and look at that...
[Garble] ...
Look at that first, yes.
Okay.
Okay. Jim says the docking tunnel index is a plus 2.1 degrees.
Okay. Plus 2.1 degrees, docking tunnel index.
Okay. He corrects himself. He says make that sign a minus. Minus 2.1 degrees.
Okay. We just changed, plus to minus.
Okay. And your second item was, we can drink all that descent water that's left - look like about 5 percent, and I'll get book here and be ready to start writing.
Okay. Get - This won't be as long as - as the one T. K. read up, but you'll need several pages, probably.
Okay. I've got lots of pages here of Ken's photo log set to go.
Okay, Freddo. Okay. This is "Entry, LM Prep." Starts EI minus 6 hours. At that time, you power up the AGS. I think I'll give you a line at a time and, when I hear you say okay on that, I'll go to the next. That sound reasonable?
Okay. I'll go hot mike briefly.
Okay. Bat 5 ...
Hey, how do you read now?

For - That's affirm. - For Moon view attitude until CM platform release. [Long pause.]
Okay. It says maneuver in Att Hold for Moon view attitude until CM platform release.
That's affirm. Better worded, it would have been maneuver and hold in attitude for Moon view, et cetera.
Okay. That's mainly for Jack to be able to get it in the optics, you mean.
Yes, that's correct. Okay, Fred ...
Okay.
Could you give us a readback on everything up to this point?
Okay. I'll go back to Normal Voice. It, might - Or is this pretty clear?
Okay. Its clear. [Long pause.]
Okay. The master title, "Entry, LM Prep, EI Minus 6 hours." First, Bat 5 Normal Feed, On; second, use modified LM DPS/RCS, 30-minute activation checklist.

Yes. Overhead Dump Valve, Close, and it is already.
Right. Okay. That's all for the ECS. Next, Attitude Control, three, to Mode Control.
Okay. Stand by 1. [Pause.]
Oh, stand by 1, Fred. We'd like to - change the position of that Attitude Control, three, Mode Control to be just under CM free. That's a more convenient time.
Yes, I agree. Okay. Under, it'll be my item B, after verify CM free, it's Att Control, three, to Mode Control.
And, along with that, Dead Band, Max.
Okay. Three to Mode Control, comma, Dead Band to Max.
Next verify...
If I don't sound too clear, it's because I'm holding a flashlight between my teeth. [Pause.]
Roger.
Okay.
Okay. Now...
Okay. I think I'm - I'm up with you. Go ahead, Vance.
Okay. Now again down at the bottom beneath ECS, verify transfer list. [Long pause.]
Okay. Verify transfer list.
IVT to CM, and close hatch.
What was that - What was the first part of that?
Transfer yourself to the CM. Or rather, IVT, that's the Commander to the CM, and close hatch.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Actually, it's commander transfer to CM and you mean close hatches. Plural, right?
That's correct. Yes.
Okay.
Okay. That's all for the time line, Fred. Now the contingency checklist, if it's handy.
Okay. Which page?
Turn to 30-minute activation on page 24. [Pause.]
Okay. I'm there.
Okay. Now, at this point, you have this section marked up already, so what I give you now represents additional Deltas to your previously marked up checklist.
Okay. That's all right. I've got a different color pen, so it'll show up nicely. Go ahead.
Okay. Okay. Go down to item 4.
Roger.
Verify AGS Status switch, Off. That's an addition.
Do you mean, under IVT to the LM, number 4, RCS System A/B-2, Quads 4, Auto? That 4?
That's affirm. Yes. It's the - the only 4 on that page 24 and it's a - presently has after it RCS System A/B-2, Quads, 4, to Auto. Under that put...
Roger.
...put verify AGS Status switch to Off. [Pause.]
Okay. Verify AGS Status switch Off.
Okay. At the bottom of the page - Okay. You already have that. Mode Control, both, Off. [Pause.]
Okay. Next, page 26, circuit breakers. [Pause.]
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. First row is okay as is. Second row, under Flight Displays, GASTA should be closed.
Okay.
Under AC Bus A, close GASTA. [Pause.]
Okay. GASTA Flight Displays and AC Bus A will be closed.
Roger. That's all on the second line. Now the third line, under Stability and Control, ATCA (PGNS) to closed. [Pause.]
Okay. ATCA (PGNS) to Close.
That's all on that line. Fourth line, near the right side, LGC Standby to Close. And...
Wait a minute. You mean LGC/DSKY.
LGC/DSKY. I'm sorry.
Okay.
And IMU Operate, Close.
Okay. IMU Operate, Close. [Long pause.]
Okay, Vance. IMU Operate, Close.
That's correct. Okay. Fourth row is okay as is. Now we would like to add - add in a late arrival to row two. Under ...

Okay. Flight Displays, Mission Timer, Closed. We can look at the ghosties right to the end.
Yes, that's right. Okay. That's all for that page, Fred. That should add up to six circuit breakers all closed, on that page.
Vance, Jim.
Go ahead, Jim.
Have we looked seriously now at just the essential things required to make a safe LM jettison? We're not - I don't think we have the time to really do any engineering data that people might want to look at as this thing goes into the atmosphere. [Pause.]
Well, Jim. I - I think that that was what everybody aimed for, and people down here feel that it's the essentials, that it's what you need.
Well, we'll do everything you think essential, but I just don't want to be throwing switches at the last minute. What we're really thinking about, getting that Command Module in good shape. [Pause.]
Hey, Jim. This is Tom. The only reason we're bringing up the PGNS is to have another reference system just to control the LM when you jettison the thing. Over.
Okay. Okay, Tom. It's - I thought the - an AGS Att Hold would have been sufficient for this, when we first thought about this.
Yes. I agree. But we decided just in case we have any glitch with the AGS, we want to make sure we get that LM off in a good shape. And I agree with you on keeping out all the garbage on it.
Okay, Tom.
Hey, would you like to have...
Good night.
Would you like to have us play you some guitar music to put you to sleep?
(Laughter) Oh, you know how to get to a guy.
We'll even have a 12-string guitar for you, Jimbo.
Okay.
Okay, Fred. Page 28.
Okay. I'm looking at panel 16 now.
No - No changes to panel ...
[Garble]
No changes to panel 16.
Okay. I'm on 28 now.
Right. Okay. At the top of the page, under step 4, just above "VHF/S-band activation," put in, "Delete Power AMP and LGC." These are caution lights.
Okay. You mean delete Preamp.
I'm sorry. Preamp and LGC. [Pause.]
Okay.
Okay. Under "VHF/S-band activation and checkout," step 2, we have changes to the Comm as follows.
Go ahead.
Okay. Scratch - Scratch out the Down and Down Voice. That leaves - That'll give you Voice.
Okay. That's the way we had it last time.
Okay. And, we'd like to insert Ranging.
Okay. Instead of Off/Reset put Ranging.
That's correct. [Pause.]
Okay.
Okay. Under "PGNS turn-on," add in steps 1 and 2 again, which are No Attitude light off, Verb 96 Enter, and set Event Timer.
Okay. Steps 1 and 2 back in.
That's affirm. And underneath "Set Event Timer," add the following: Verb 25 Noun 07, Enter; 1257, Enter. [Pause.]
Okay. Go ahead, Vance.
Okay. If you got the 1257, Enter, then 252, Enter and Enter.
Okay. After event, set Event Timer, it's Verb 25 Noun 07, Enter; 1257, Enter; 252 Enter; Enter.
Roger. And this activates your upfiring jets.
Say the last again, Vance.
Roger. What this does, Fred, is activate upfiring jets.
Oh, okay.
They're all - actually, all vertical jets. [Long pause.]
Okay. I got it.
Next, the same page, under "DAP set gimbal drive," go to step 2. Okay. Add in after Noun 46, 32021. [Pause.]
Okay. 32021.
Okay. Proceeding on down below the Noun 47, to the Proceed, insert Verb 34, Enter, after the Proceed. And that would come before the Noun 48. [Pause.]
Okay. To Pro and then do a Verb 34. [Pause.]
Roger. Okay. We have some noise here, Fred. Stand by a minute. [Pause.]
I switched OMNIs. How's that?
Hey, that helped. Okay. No changes now on 29, 30, and 31. Next page is 32. [Pause.]
Okay. I'm on 32.
Okay. At the very first step above "Guidance Control, AGS," put in Verb 76, Enter. [Pause.]
Okay. Verb 76, Enter.
Okay. Below "Guidance Control, AGS," the third step should be changed to be Mode Control, both, to Att Hold.
Okay. You want Mode Control, both, to Att Hold.
That's affirm.
Okay.
Okay. At minus 6 - 6 hours - or 6 minutes rather, under Mode Control, PGNS, Att Hold, which was scratched out, insert Verb 41 Noun 20, Enter, and three more Enters. So - So it's as shown in your procedure there.
Yes.
Okay ...
Coarse align 000.
Below that, put in DEDA, 400 plus 5. [Long pause.]
Okay. DEDA, 400 plus 5.
Okay. Okay. We want back in again the next step which is "At burn attitude: Verb 40 Noun 20, Enter." [Pause.]
Okay. [Pause.]
Okay. Proceeding on down, delete "At burn attitude" and the step above it, which is 400 plus 5. [Pause.]
400 plus 5 and the "at burn attitude."
Correct. [Pause.]
Okay. That's all for page 32, Fred. Next, page 33. [Pause.]
Go ahead.
Okay. Under 4 minutes, minus 4 minutes, add back in Mode Control, both, to Att Hold. [Long pause.]
Okay. Mode Control, both, to Att Hold.
Okay. Two steps below that, add back in TTCA Commander Throttle min DPS, and add in DPS. [Pause.]
Wait a minute.
Stand by 1.
TTC - Yes. Seems like you should be in Jets, since this is going to be - is this going to be RCS or a DPS burn?
Okay. This will be Jets for RCS and Throttle for DPS.
What I don't understand is, what is this SPS likely to be? I thought it was going to be an RCS.
Well, we - We expect that, but we're remaining flexible.
(Laughter) Okay. Okay. I'll put in TTCA Throttle min for DPS, Jets for RCS.
That's correct. Okay. That's all on the page 33. Go to page 34. [Pause.]
Okay; 34.
Okay. Beneath everything on that page, add in the following. Return to "Entry, - LM Prep" check - return to "Entry, LM Prep" checklist...
Hold on, Vance; I don't understand. We want to delete everything on page 34?
No, that's not correct, Fred. What we want to do is leave everything the way it is on 34, and add this one comment I'm giving you at the - at the bottom of it.
Oh, okay. Okay. I misunderstood. Okay. Go ahead with your added comment.
Return to "Entry LM Prep checklist." [Pause.]
Add "EI"...
[Garble] turn to - return to "Entry, LM checklist?"
That's affirm. At EI minus 5 hours.
Okay. At EI minus 5 hours. Let me take a look and see how that flows, now.
Okay. And also you have a ...
Okay. That would be the LM - the LM preentry procedure. Yes. Okay.
That's correct, and, also on that page, you - from our last correct - or addition exercise, you have a section called "Reestablish PTC." We'd like to scratch all of that, of course.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, Fred. That's all except for one comment that we have, and - Just a second.
Stand by 1. Fred, we're polling the room for comments here, any last minute thoughts from people. We'll be right back with you.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay, Fred. Just two changes, comments to what we just gave you. The first is near the front at EI - in the section under "EI minus 2½ hours, power removal from CM LM umbilical." We'll let you turn to that.
Okay, I'm there at "EI minus 2½ hours, power removal CM LM umbilical."
Okay. Under LM, we have a step, Bat 2, Low Voltage, Off/Reset, than On. Next we have a step Bat 2, Hi Voltage. Off/Reset, then On. We request that you wait in between these two steps for us to give you a Go. In other words, we'd like to look and see that all the relays closed and all that sort of thing before you throw Bat 2, Hi Voltage, to Off/Reset, and On. [Long pause.]
Okay, After Bat 2, Low Voltage, Off/Reset, I'll - then On, I'll wait for a MSFN Go before proceeding.
Right-o. Okay. Next, at - Under the section of "EI minus 1 hour and 45 minutes" - No, change that. Correction, "EI minus 1 hour, 35 minutes," refer to the ECS section, and we have a change. [Long pause.]
All right. Go ahead, Vance.
Okay, Jim's right. We should cross out all this stuff with a couple of exceptions. Forward Dump valve, Closed, the first step, should remain. All other steps should be scratched, except for the last one, which is Overhead Dump valve, Closed. That leaves two steps. [Pause.]
Okay. Under ECS, we delete all except the first step, Forward Dump valve, Close, and step 10, which is Overhead Dump valve, Closed, and leave in verify transfer list. [Pause.]
That's affirm. Leave in what follows, which is verify transfer list and IVT and all that. [Long pause.]
IVT, of course, meaning CDR transferring to the CM. [Pause.]
We wouldn't forget it.
Okay, Freddo. That's - That's the changes. Not quite as extensive as the CSM had, but still pretty long. Any comments or questions to the house here? [Pause.]
No, it looks pretty good to me, Vance.
Okay. Very good. Only other comment, aside from the checklist, we've been watching your descent stage water, and it looks - or your ascent stage water, and it looks real good.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, Fred. We're going to try to refrain from calling you from now on, so that you can maybe get a couple of winks. We're getting a status around the room first, to see if anybody has any comments for you and, after that, we'll try to leave you alone for awhile.
Thank you.
Aquarius, Houston. [Long pause.]
Aquarius, Houston. [Long pause.]
Hey, Freddo. Are you there?
All right, go ahead.
Okay. We polled the room. We don't have much for you. Only comments as follows: your consumables are looking good; your entry gamma right now is minus 6.01. We're expecting a midcourse of 2.81 foot per second which should be about 21 seconds of RCS.
Okay. It sounds good.
Okay, Fred. See you in the morning.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston. Request you open the Power Amplifier circuit breaker and Down Voice Backup, please. [Long pause.]
Complete.
Roger.
