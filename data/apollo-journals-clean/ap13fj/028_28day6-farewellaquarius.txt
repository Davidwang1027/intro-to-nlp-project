I have an RCS light, Houston. [Pause.]
Okay, Jim. That's the one we warned you about some time ago. Low helium; no sweat.
Oh, okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. There's a star angle difference with stars 36 and 40.
How about that, baby!
And I'm maneuvering, Houston.
Okay - [garble].
Roger that. Copy you're maneuvering to the LM Jett attitude. Is that right?
That's affirm...
That's affirm.
I'm going to torque those gimbal angles.
Torque them, babe, full stroke gimbal.
There it is. Okay. I'll do a star check.
Okay. [Long pause.]
[Garble] one fifty-three zero... [Garble]
Okay, Odyssey. You're suddenly ahead of the timeline. [Long pause.]
Odyssey, Houston. Request Omni Bravo. [Pause.]
I am Omni Bravo, Joe.
Okay. [Pause.]
Okay, Houston. The sextant star check passes. [Pause.]
Say again, Jack.
I did a star check, and it passes. It puts that star right in the telescope.
Good enough. You can press on in the checklist, Jack. [Long pause.]
Mind out LM gimbal lock, Jim.
It's the Command Module's gimbal lock I'm worried about.
[Laughter.] Okay. [Long pause.]
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. If you concur, we would be inclined to recommend that you go to AGS for the maneuver because you'll have to be there later on anyway.
Okay.
And AGS Pulse is the recommendation.
We're having trouble maneuvering, Joe, without getting it in gimbal lock.
Okay. You can ...
You picked a lousy attitude, though, to separate.
Well, we apologize. Just take your time. Jim, we've got time now,
Okay. [Long pause.]
Aah, Houston, why can't I stay in PGNS Att Hold for the LM attitude hold?
Stand by on that, Jim. [Long pause.]
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. Our recommendation is that you stay in AGS for the LM Jett simply because we've thought it through. We've got the right deadbands and all set up. Over.
Okay. It's a lot easier for me to maneuver in PGNS, Joe, than it is AGS.
Yes. You can maneuver in PGNS, Jim. I'm sorry, I thought you were talking about the Att Hold and the LM Jett afterward. You can maneuver in PGNS if you want to. [Long pause.]
I want to get way over here, Joe. To prevent him into gimbal lock, I have the yaw at about - I'd say about almost 50 degrees.
Roger that. Just stay out of gimbal lock and that 45-degree isn't critical - the out of plane, that is. [Long pause.]
Odyssey, Houston. Request Omni Charlie.
Okay. Going Omni Charlie.
Thank you.
There.
Okay. Good.
Roger. That's Verb 46. Roger. Aquarius, Houston. [Pause.]
Go ahead.
Okay, Jim. The particular DAP configuration we have set up now is using more fuel than we'd like out of system B. We'd like you to reconfigure the DAP to 30021. Over. [Pause.]
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Odyssey, Houston.
Go ahead.
We'd like to have you turn the optics power off until you need them again, and we would like to have you check the RCS ring 1 and 2 temps for us. Over.
Optics power going off.
Okay. [Pause.]
Okay, Joe. Our ring 1 is 50; ring 2 is plus 42.
Ring 1 is 50; copy. What was the other?
42.
Got it. Thank you.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. I am at the LM Sep attitude and I'm planning on bailing out.
Okay. I can't think of a better idea, Jim.
I'll go to AGS Att Hold, if you want me to.
We recommend that, Jim. [Long pause.]
Okay, Aquarius; Houston. In AGS Att Hold, we recommend Wide Dead Band. Over. [Pause.]
I'm in the AGS Dead Band.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Aquarius, Houston. Don't forget the [Garble] [Long pause.]
You need to relay something downstairs, Jim? [Pause.]
Odyssey, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Okay. Our troops would like to have you go to the Systems Test Meter and read out the injector temps on RCS for us. [Pause.]
Okay. Okay. In work. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. Let me read out the injector temperatures for you.
Go ahead.
5 Charlie, 4.2; 5 Dogs 4.6; 6 Alpha, 4.3; 6 Bravo, 4.3; 6 Charlie, 3.6; 6 Dog, 3.6.
Okay. Copy that. No complaints. [Long pause.]
Okay. We're ready to proceed with hatch closeup.
Okay. Did Jim get the film out of Aquarius? [Pause.]
Yes. We - You mean the film we took this morning?
That's affirm.
Yes, We've transferred that.
Okay. Good deal. Jack, let me mention something about the hatch integrity check. You're going to vent the tunnel until you get a 3-psi Delta-P. That should take 9 or 10 minutes, and it's our firm feeling that you don't have to wait another 10 minutes after that for a leak check. If it holds pressure for a minute or so or even gets down there, you know you've got a good hatch. Over.
Okay. Copy that.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. We've got an O2 Flow High.
Okay, Jack, are you...
Well, we might be pressurizing a lot of the system that was not pressurized.
Roger. I expect that's the case. Let us check it.
Okay. Take a good look at Cabin.
Will do. [Long pause.]
Odyssey, Houston. Just verify your Direct O2 is Off. Over.
Yes, sir. That is verified.
Okay, and...
[Garble] it's dropping now, Joe.
Roger. We think that you were just pressurizing the cabin up to that regulator's particular spec.
Odyssey, Houston.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Okay. We're observing middle gimbal angle getting a little bit high. The LM appears to be deadbanding okay within its attitude, but just wanted you to know that we're keeping an eye on it and if it does get too high, we might want you to punch off early.
Okay.
And verify that the hatch is secured and that you are venting the tunnel. Over.
That's verified. We have a Delta-P of 2.8.
Real good. Real good. [Long pause.]
Okay, Joe. Since we're ahead of the time line, can I proceed on and kind of punch off early, or do you want me to punch off at exactly 1 hour?
Jack, when you are comfortably ready to punch off, you can go ahead and do it.
Okay.
Odyssey, Houston. We just had a formal Go for LM Jett at your convenience. Over.
Okay. Thanks, Joe.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, Odyssey; Houston. We're ready for you to bring the BMAGs On and Warm Up and all other things being equal, we'd like you to go through the LM Jett at - on the checklist you've got. And that is BMAGs 1...
Okay. Will do.
...1. That's BMAG 1 now, as you know.
Yes, BMAG 1 is in Warm Up.
Good deal.
Okay, Houston. Do you have a Command Module weight for me?
Stand by 1, Jack. [Long pause.]
Odyssey, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. I'm reminded that the entry DAP is all you've got. It'll initialize itself, and you won't have an - you won't have an RCS DAP, so you don't have to fool with it.
Okay.
Okay, Joe. I'm - Have you got your checklist out there on the SCS powerup?
That's affirm.
Okay. I'm coming down here to a step that says FDAI Power, off. Is that what you want right now, I guess, huh?
Go ahead.
Okay, Jack. That FDAI Power, Off, is to stop momentary glitches as you bring up the BMAG to put it on, and you turn right around and put the FDAI Power right back on 1.
Okay. And I don't have the BMAG Temp light out yet. Do you want me to go ahead and put the BMAG On with the Temp light still On?
That's affirm. We can go ahead and you'll have a good stable rate.
All right. Let's do it.
Okay, Houston. We'll punch off at 141 plus 30.
Okay, Jack. We copy and we concur.
Okay, Houston. Do we have a Go for Pyro Arm? [Long pause.]
Odyssey, Houston. We can give you a Go if you'll put the Logic On momentarily first.
Okay. The SECS Logic is on.
Okay. Just copied that, and you are Go for Pyro Arm.
Real fine.
10 seconds.
Five. LM jettison.
Okay, copy that. Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you. [Long pause.]
Watch gimbal lock there, Jack.
Yeah, we did.
Odyssey, Houston. Request Omni Bravo.
