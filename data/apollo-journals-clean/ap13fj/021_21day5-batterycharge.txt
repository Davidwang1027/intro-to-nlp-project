Everything's running real smooth over in Timber Cove, Jim.
Sounds pretty good. How about at El Lago?
Same. Everything's smooth there, too.
Good.
Jim, we've had a lot of people working on the entry procedures, and they'll be continuing to do so. We got a few ideas we'd like to toss at you so you can start thinking about them if you think you're in a position to discuss them without waking up the other guys. What do you think? [Long pause.]
Yes, go ahead. It's okay.
One of the first things we want to do is charge the battery in CSM, so we can get some LM power over there to do that, and we have procedures ginned up to do it. In regards to reentry, we're planning our last midcourse at 5 hours before Entry Interface, and, if we have to make one, that is. And then we'd like to jettison the Service Module at 4 hours and a half, roughly, before Entry Interface, and take the next 3 to 3½ hours for taking pictures, cranking up the Command Module G&N, taking care of stowage, and other odds and ends. And we'd hang on to the LM until 1 hour before Entry Interface, and then we'd jettison that. And these procedures are going to be run integrated in the CMS and LMS tomorrow morning, and, hopefully, later on in the day, we'll do it again with Mission Control on the loop. A couple of other things we'd like to toss at you: one question is what do we do with the OPS. The thought is that there is adequate O2 in the Command Module and that the OPS represents high pressure source and a stowage problem, and people are thinking about leaving them in the LM. The other thing is that we think you might want to make this a suited entry, suiting up prior to LM jettison, because what we're doing is, when we jettison the LM, we're going to do it like we did in Apollo 10 ... just let the beauty go, and if we weren't suited, why, we'd be betting on the hatch seal to take care of us. So we thought we'd toss these few ideas at you. Some of them are ones that are particularly pertinent questions at this time. [Pause.]
Okay. A suited entry would sort of [garble] the 1-hour LM jettison back and [garble] back and forth up to that time. [Garble] impede our progress back and forth. [Garble] [Pause.]
We're losing you, Jim.
Okay. I think I've got you back. I guess the midcourse at 5 hours prior to [garble]
Affirmative, Jim. Midcourse 5 hours prior to Entry Interface. [Pause.]
If that's the case, all I'm worried about is having that all squared away. It's long before that [garble] I want everything in its place. All the stowage cleared away, all the [garble] ready to go and know exactly what to do and [garble] so that we can do the midcourse, and [garble] get into the Command Module [garble] jettison the Service Module, and then know exactly how to get into the LM.
Roger. All those procedures will work - will be worked out precisely, and we agree that the stowage and all of those peripheral details ought to be taken care of before midcourse. [Pause.]
And, I guess, that last midcourse, we'd want to start looking at midcourse fairly early, if we have the power to do so, mainly because of attitude control. This last time was fairly easy, but I'm not too sure how long we can continue to [garble]. I have the confidence that if everything is under control as it is now, we'll probably be going long before entry. [Long pause.]
I have [garble] in, and it seems about as cold as it is now, we'll probably be going into suits long before entry. [Pause.]
Yes. That's what we were thinking. [Long pause.]
I guess the two things which are somewhat unresolved at the moment are what to do with the OPS and what to do about the suited entry. We thought we'd toss those at you to see what you thought about them.
Okay. As far as the OPS is concerned, we have enough oxygen in the spacecraft [garble] to get us through. I have no [garble] Command Module [garble] suit loop prior to entry. I was looking at [garble] OPS [garble] sources of oxygen [garble] also in the - in the front of the suit loop or [garble] circulate [garble] [Long pause.]
Jim, I'm sorry. We're not catching what you're saying. The comm is getting kind of bad right now.
Okay, Jack. How do you read now?
I've still got you with quite a bit of background noise, but if you talk up like that, I think we can hear you.
Okay. My only concern about leaving the OPS and/or the PLSS in the Command Module is how soon do we have to live off the Command Module consumables prior to entry, and the PLSS has a fan and has a lithium hydroxide [garble] use the Command Module system. Also, the OPS [garble] right now [garble] Command Module [garble] Command Module oxygen and electrical power is [garble] but I had just as soon be [garble] back in the LM.
It sounds like the general gist of your comments are that if things remain pretty much as they are now in the Command Module, you'd just as soon leave the OPS in the LM. Is that affirm?
That's affirm. [Pause.]
Okay. And maybe you'd like to think over the suited entry bit a little while. [Pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead.
Okay [garble]. How we align the Command Module right for entry, especially if you have the LM in back. Over.
Roger. That's one subject that's been getting a lot of attention, and let me see if I can get some general ideas on that at the moment. [Pause.]
Okay.
Jim, I can give you the general idea of the proposed procedure for bringing the Command Module G&N up. It's the presently proposed one. We may come up with a better one, but there's what we're looking at right now. First thing we plan to do is to - using the LM COAS, sight on the Earth with the LM just as we did in the midcourse. Then we'll do a body-axis align, 400 plus 5 on the AGS, to put the AGS ball at 000. And then we can give you an AGS ball attitude to fly to, to point the CSM optics at the Moon. And, if you can see stars, why, we can use those too. Then we can give you an equivalent set of CDU angles to put into NOUN 20 and to torque the platform over. So, now we're coarse aligned. Then we do a fine align by shooting at the Moon and then at the Sun. Do you follow all that? [Long pause.]
Okay, Jack. Let me see if I have it. What we do is point the LM at the Earth as we did for the midcourse COAS, and we do a body-axis aline on the AGS. Then you give us an AGS ball attitude to fly to. [Garble] the LM, and then we [garble] point the [garble] at the Moon. Then you would update the - give us some CDUs to coarse align. [Garble] fine align [garble] on stars or the Moon or the Earth. Stand by. Okay. We had another Master Alarm, Jack. I don't see any lights down there, except the battery light's still there. You want - [garble] ECS display . Okay. And the number 2 battery still has a light on it. I suspect it may be the same problem that we had before [garble]. [Garble].
Okay. Let us talk it over a second, and we'll tell you what to do. [Long pause.]
Jim, is the battery light kind of flickering?
Yes. That's affirm, Jack. [Pause.]
Yes. The battery light's flickering, and it triggers off the Master Alarm.
Okay. Well, that ... temperature sensor on battery 2 is kind of cycling back and forth and every time it does, it triggers a Master Alarm, Jim.
Okay. Same old problem, huh?
Yes. [Long pause.]
And, Jim, finally on the P52, we're considering using the ... the Moon and then the Sun for the fine align.
Okay. The Moon and the Sun for the fine align. Understand. We'll go through this again here [garble]. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jack. Once ... Once I get the spacecraft at the proper attitude [garble]. [Long pause.]
Jim, I didn't copy your last question due to background noise. [Pause.]
Okay. Once ... Once you get the AGS ball aligned [garble] Command Module [garble]. [Pause.]
After we do the body axis align on the AGS, we can tell you what attitude on the AGS ball to fly to in order to point the CSM optics at the Moon or at some star. And then we can, knowing where the optics are pointed, give you an equivalent set of CDU angles to put in Noun 20 to torque the platform.
Okay. I see. [Pause.]
That's the current thinking. It may change between now and tomorrow, but right now, that's the way it looks, Jim. It'll probably be some take-off on that anyway.
Okay. Are they planning on a G&N entry or using another system, like EMS or something like that?
It will be a G&N entry.
Nothing like going first class.
Yes. That'll be a switch, won't it?
Jim, are you broken into the food locker in the LM yet?
That's affirm, Jack. I sure have. I just put a meal away.
You say you did find everything in order in there, huh?
Yes, everything was great.
Okay. I'll pass it. [Long pause.]
I had a question about that earlier.
Right.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead.
I understand that one of your reasons for a suited entry is the fact that the Command Module hatch [garble] hasn't been good. It doesn't seem to be any different, but in the other [garble] our hatch is no better than other spacecraft. [Long pause.]
No, the situation, Jim, is that your hatch is as good as any other hatch but that we won't have a chance to verify it until so late in the game, like 1 hour before Entry Interface, in this case; whereas before, why, we had a chance to evaluate it in lunar orbit. Over.
Oh, okay.
And that might make your time line a little too crowded, getting your suits on there at the last minute; say, less than an hour before Entry Interface. [Pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
Jim, the next action item we want to pursue is transferring some LM power up to the Command Module Main B so we can start charging battery, and I guess what we ought to do is start on that one when somebody else gets up to help you there. So, when you decide to get the other guys up, or to have someone help, why, let us know and we'll start working on that.
Okay. I'll let you have Jack, and Fred's [garble]. When in the time line [garble]? [Pause.]
Say again, Jimm. I did't catch that.
When in our time ... What's the GET do you plan on [garble]. [Long pause.]
Jim, I didn't catch all of what you said, but I think you wanted to know when the procedure for entry are going to be available and read up to you. If that's the case, why, we're talking about 120 hours or so. As far as the ... charging battery A, we want to do that as soon as the other guys get up to help you. We've already passed up some of that procedure, and we have a couple of Deltas to it.
Roger. Jack's already up. He asked [garble] curious when you want to do it. Did you understand that? [Garble]. Is that correct? [Long pause.]
Jim, we're having trouble hearing you. The next order of business is to charge battery A, and when you get somebody to help you there, why, we'll go ahead and get done with it.
Okay. Sounds good.
And, before you start working on it let us know, because we've got some Deltas to the battery charging procedure.
Roger. I'm putting Jack on the line now to copy down the Deltas [garble]. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jack. Go ahead. [Pause.]
Aquarius, did you call?
Yes, Jack. I'm on the line. [Garble] [Pause.]
Okay. Go ahead now. I can hear better.
Okay, Jack. Joe Kerwin passed me up the procedure for powering the CSM from the LM. Has it changed?
Yes. If you'll get that out, I'll read you the Deltas. [Pause.]
Okay. I've got it.
Okay, The second step was in the LM circuit breakers panel 11 and 16: Ascent ECA Control, close, two of them. Cross that out. In the next line, we had Battery 5 Normal Feed, on; cross out Battery 5 and put Battery 6 in there. In the next line was ...
[Garble] Jack [garble]. Hey, Jack; I have for step 3, I have Bat 5 and Bat 6 Normal Feed, on. You just want Bat 6?
That's affirmative. Just Bat 6, Jack. And the next line, you had Battery 1 and 3. Make that Battery 1, 2, 3, and 4. Just add Bats 2 and 4. All four descent Bats. And then the next two lines about waiting 30 minutes, cross that out. And the next line about Batteries 2 and 4 Off/Reset, cross that out, too. [Pause.]
And, Jack, the ...
Okay. Let me read ...
Go ahead.
Let me read you all the steps as I've got them, Jack, and make sure we've got them right. [Garble] Ascent ECA, two, closed. Step 2 will now be Bat 6, Normal Feed, on. Step 3, Bats 1, 2, 3, and 4, Off/Reset. [Pause.]
Okay. That part's all right, Jack. And we had ... about 11 or 12 steps for the Command Module. They go as is with no change. And then we had a couple of more procedures for the LM. Stand by 1.
Okay. Jack, let me read you Command Module procedures just to make sure I have them right, also.
Okay. Go ahead with the Command Module procedures.
Okay. Connect LM and CSM umbilicals. Step 2, panel 5: LM Power 1 AC and 2 AC, closed, circuit breakers. Step 3, panel 5: EPS Sensor Signal, Main B, closed. Step 4, panel [garble] Power Entry/Postlanding closed. Then there's step 5: Main B Bat Bus B, closed. Verify Main Bus voltage, then switch the LM power to CSM. Step 7: CB Main B Bat Bus B, open. And on panel 250, Bat B Power Entry and Postlanding, open. Verify Main Bus voltage. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jack. The CSM procedure's okay, and, then we had to go back to the LM and do something. And the first line is okay, cross out "Bat 5 and 6 Off," delete that. And delete the next line also, that says "Panell 11 to 16 Ascent ECA Control, open." Then we had a couple of notes which remain the same. Go ahead.
Okay. I didn't get the notes, but I'll read you the steps as I have them now. One step, Bat 1, 2, 3, and 4 [garble] and at this point should have Batteries 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 On. Is that affirmative?
That's affirmative. So now we have Bat 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, On, and I got two notes. Number 1 is: your circuit breaker protection limits ... your circuit breaker protection ... limits the current to 15 amps. Number 2 note is: now the umbilical between the LM and the Command Module is hot. And the Main Bus voltage can be monitored by selecting Main B. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jack. These notes are: circuit breaker protection limits current to 15 amps. The tube, the umbilical between the CSM and LM is hot. I can monitor Main B for the bus voltage.
That's affirm, Jack. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jack. One question here. If we transfer power like this, we're not going to cut us short on power remaining in the CSM [garble], are we [garble]?
Say it again, Jack. I didn't get it.
Okay. Stand by. If we configure the CSM for powering up the LM, we aren't going to cut it short on LM power requirements to get us back in the Entry Interface, are we?
That's a negative, Jack. According to the latest update, we've got ampere-hours out to 203 hours. [Long pause.]
Stand by. [Garble] [Long pause.]
Okay, Jack. One question from Jim is, he wants to know whether the procedure has been tried [garble]. [Pause.]
Okay. Try it again, now, Jack. What did Jim want to know?
Okay. He would like to know whether the procedure has been tried and whether it has been found to be okay; and there's no danger of shorting out any of our batteries or anything we have on board the LM now. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jack. This procedure has not been tried out as such; however, the hardware paths through which the current flows are the same ones which we used during translunar trajectory, and there's not a problem with shorting out a descent battery. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. I'll relay that to Jim. [Long pause.]
Jack, of course, the reason for all of this is that we see we're 20 amp-hours short on one of the entry batteries, and we've got to juice that up to get you home with.
Okay.
Okay. Now, what we owe you from here on out is the actual battery A charge procedure, and then a procedure to turn this all around, again. [Pause.]
Okay. Do you have it there, and how long is it [garble]. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jack. I have the procedure in front of me. It's about 18 steps, and the reason it's so long is because we're starting from this basic configuration which we gave you earlier. It concerns a charge on battery A, of course, which is our low one. So, when you're ready to copy it, let me know.
Okay. Let's go at it.
Okay. Are you ready to read ... copy it?
Go ahead.
Okay. On panel 250, circuit breaker Bat A, Power Entry/Postlanding, close; on panel 275, circuit breaker Inverter Power 2, Main B, close. Next several circuit breakers are on panel 5; circuit breaker Bat Relay Bus, Bat A, close; circuit breaker EPS Sensor Unit, AC Bus 2, close; CB EPS Sensor Signal, AC2, close; CB Battery Charger, Main B, close. Are you still with me? [Pause.]
Okay, Jack. I'll read back those steps you gave me so far. Panel 250 CB Bat A, Power Entry/Postlanding, close, panel 275, CB Inverter Power 2, Main B, close; panel 5, CB Bat Relay Bus, Bat A, close; CB EPS Sensor Unit, AC Bus 2, close; CB EPS Sensor Signal, AC2, close, CB Bat Charger, Main B, close. [Pause.]
Okay. Good readback, Jack. The only one is number 1 ... number 4. I didn't get your readback, but it's EPS Sensor Unit AC Bus 2, close. You got that?
Yes. I read that back CB EPS Sensor Unit, close.
Okay. To continue ... to continue on ... the same panel, panel 5: circuit breaker, Battery Charger, AC Power, close; circuit breaker Battery Charger, Bat A Charge, close; circuit breaker Inverter Control 2, close; circuit breaker Inverter Control 3, close; I've got a switch for you, Main Bus Tie, Bat A/C, Off; and another switch, Battery Charge to AC2. Read those back. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jack. CB Bat Charger to AC Power, close. Stand by. Okay. I had to get a light here. CB Bat Charger, Bat A Charge, close; CB Inverter Control 2, close; CB Inverter Control 3, close; the two switches, Main Bus Tie, Bat A/C, Off; and the second one, Bat Charger to AC2.
Okay. That's a good readback. How about reaching over there on your right-hand side and turning the Biomed off? See if we can improve the Comm a little bit. [Long pause.]
Okay. How do you read, now?
Okay. I'm reading you real good now, and I want to verify that the main bus tie that we switched Off was Bat Alpha Charlie.
That's verified; Main Bus Tie, Bat Alpha Charlie, Off. And that should [garble].
Okey. And in panel 3, I've got a switch for you. AC Inverter 2 to Main B. [Pause.]
Okay. AC Inverter 2 to Main B.
Okay. And switch Inverter 2, AC Bus 2 to on; and another switch, AC Bus 2 Reset, to reset and center; switch Battery Charge to Alpha; switch DC Indicator select Bat Charger, and then what we want you to do is to report the charger current and voltage to MSFN every l0 minutes for the first half hour, and then once every 30 minutes after that. And that'll be on our call, Jack. Read back the switches that I just gave you. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jack. It's panel 3, AC Inverter 2, Main B; Inverter 2, AC Bus 2, on; AC Bus 2 Reset to reset and center, Bat Charger to A, AC Indicator select to Bat Charger. Report amps and volts to MSFN every 10 minutes for the first 30 minutes, and then every 30 minutes on a MSFN call.
Okay. That's a good readback, Jack. Now the only thing we owe you is a turnaround from this, which we will have.
Okay. Let me ask one question, here. About how long do you think it'll take to charge these batteries?
It's going to take you about 15 hours. [Long pause.]
Jack, about how many amperes of LM power will this 15 hours [garble]? [Pause.]
Stand by. We'll get it for you ...
How many, Jack?
Okay. He got it. He got the question. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jack. That's going to take 120 amp-hours out of the LM, which is equivalent to 10 hours, which will put us back to 193 hours, and that's plenty.
Okay. Let me relay that to Jim here. It'll be 120 amp-hours, which leaves us ... which puts us back from 203 hours [garble] to 193 hours.
Yes, there's that much to spare. [Pause.]
Okay, Jack. One question here. If we have any problem setting up this LM power to the CSM, is the quickest way to get out of it, return to the normal configuration, as it is for me to just switch the LM Power to CSM to Reset then Off? [Pause.]
Stand by 1.
I would like to give one quick step in case that gave Jim report some sort of problem for us to get out of it quickly.
Okay. Let us talk it over for a minute, Jack.
Okay. Real fine. And while you guys are talking it over, you might read back ... Have you got the procedure for reversing this? I'll copy that.
Okay, Jack. Are you with me?
Yes. We're still here, Jack. What we want to do is follow you through on this, so we're going to get high bit rate to do it. In answer to your question, to undo this procedure quickly, in the event a problem develops, be sure that you don't touch the LM Power switch because it's got a Reset position. But the way to undo it; is go into the CSM and on panel 5 open two circuit breakers. And they're some of the first ones we read to you. Open LM Power-1 Main B, and open LM Power-2 Main B. You copy that?
Okay. Understand. If I want to get out of this real quickly, I have to open just two circuit breakers in the CSM; that's on panel 5, LM Power-1 Main B, LM Power-2 Main B.
Okay. And before you go ahead with this, let's establish high bit rate and wait 1 on that. And then as we go through the procedure we want you to wait when you get power on Main B so we can take a look at Main B without any loads on it before we start charging the batteries. [Pause.]
Okay. I understand you want high bit rate on the LM or CSM just before we start this?
That will be high bit rate on the LM, and stand by for it.
Okay. [Pause.]
Okay, Jack. Before we go ahead with this, what we want to do is read you the reverse ... the normal reverse procedure.
Okay. I'm ready to copy. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jack. I got the start on how you reverse this procedure. Ready to copy?
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. First you want to reverse the battery charge procedure. To do that, on panel 3, switch Battery Charge, Off; AC Inverter 2, Off; panel 5, Main Bus Tie Bat Alpha Charlie, On, up; panel 250, circuit breaker Bat Alpha, Power Entry, and Postlanding, Open. Read back. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jack. On panel 3, Battery Charger, Off, AC Inverter 2, Off; on panel 5, Main Bus Tie Alpha Charlie, On; panel 250, CB Bat A, Power Entry and Postlanding, Open.
That's affirmative, Jack, and then if you'll go back to the rest of the circuit breakers on that list, and just opposite ... Open them all up. Stand by 1. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jack. Go back to the battery charge procedure I gave you. And, in order to terminate charge, just ... You'll just have to write "Open" or "Off" next to the circuit switch that I gave you. So on panel 250, that circuit breaker you've already opened; on panel 275, Inverter Power-2 Main B, open; panel 5, Bat Relay Bus Bat A, open; EPS Sensor Unit AC Bus 2, open, EPS Sensor Signal AC2, open; Battery Charger, Main B, open; Battery Charger AC Power, open; Battery Charger, Bat A Charge, open; Inverter Control 2, open; Inverter Control 3, open; you've already done the Main Bus Tie; and then Bat Charge switch to AC 1. Over on panel 3, you have already set the AC Inverter 2 to Off and then Inverter 2 AC Bus 2, Off; AC Bus 2 Reset to Off. You have already put the Battery Charger switch to Off; and your DC Indicator select to Main B. Over. [Pause.]
Okay, Jack. Do you want me to read it back to you?
No, if you've got something in the right-hand column for all of those, we don't want to have to do it. And now one more thing I owe you is how to untransfer LM power to the CSM, and I'll get that for you in a jiffy.
Okay. I'll be standing by to copy it.
Okay. We have a last minute change to that.
Houston, 13. [Pause.]
Go ahead.
Okay, Jack. One thing ... I guess you probably all have considered it, but what heavy things can we store down there where the SRCs normally go to help increase our L over D?
I understand the question is what kind of heavy things can you store where the SRCs go.
Yes. They go down in the LEB underneath the computer, and the heavier things you have down there increases the L over D. We don't have any SRCs, so I was just wondering what heavy things ... We could probably put some cameras, television cameras, things like that that normally pretty heavy down there in ... that, in our SRC. No, we can't, put the in our SRC, but we could put them in that container down there which would help decrease our L over D. Anything else you can think of would be greatly appreciated because we don't even have a throw away station, so we're down a little bit in L over D.
Okay. Let me pass that question along, and get somebody working on it. [Long pause.]
Souvenirs, I guess.
What souvenirs? [Laughter.] All I've got is a Marine Corps foxhole-digging shovel.
You've got all you need then, buddy. [Pause.]
Okay. Ready to copy the power removal from the Command Module/LM umbilical.
I'm ready to copy. Go ahead.
Okay. This assumes that all the descent batteries are on line and Ascent Battery 6 is on Normal Feed, as we said earlier. First thing you do is go in the CSM and look on panel 5 circuit breaker. LM Power-2 Main B, open; LM Power-1 Main A, open; circuit breaker EPS Sensor Signal Main B, open.
Hey, Jack.
Go ahead. [Pause.]
[Garble]. You got just a little bit scratchy there because of the antenna problem. Let me read this back to you. [Long pause.]
Okay. What I got, Jack, was the procedure assumes that all Descent Batteries are On, and Bat 6 is on Normal Feed. Now we're going into the LM and on panel 5, we take LM, or CB LM Power-2, Main B, open. And that's as far as I got.
Okay, the second one is on panel 5 also. Circuit breaker, LM Power-1, Main A, open; circuit breaker EPS Sensor Signal, Main B, open. Okay, read those back for the CSM, and I'll give you some steps in the LM. [Pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay. CB LM Power-2, Main B, open; CB LM Power-1, Main A, open; CB EPS Sensor Signal, Main B, open. Stand by 1, Jack. [Pause.]
Jack, I don't think we ever closed CB LM Power-1, Main A. We closed LM Power-2, Main B, and LM Power-1, Main B. Both of them on Main B. [Pause.]
Yes, you're right. Both of them should be Main B.
Okay. Copy that.
Okay. Ready to copy the LM?
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. On panel 16 circuit breaker, EPS, Bat Feed Ties, two, open; and now you've got to listen real carefully for high volts and low volts, Battery 1, High Volts, to Off/Reset; Battery 2, Low Volts, to Off/Reset and then On: Battery 2, High Volts, to Off/Reset and then On; Battery 1, High Volts, On; and then the circuit breaker on panel 16, EPS: Bat Feed Ties, both of them, closed. Read back. [Pause.]
Okay. On the LM side of the house is on panel 16. CB EPS Bat Feed Ties, two, open; Battery 1, High Voltage, Off/Reset; Battery 2, Low Voltage, Off/ Reset then On; Battery 2, High Voltage, Off/Reset then On; Battery 1, High Voltage, On. Panel 16, CB Bat Feed Ties, two, closed.
Okay. That's a good readback. It concludes the procedure going both ways and now we just have to stand by.
Okay, when do you plan to start this?
Darn soon.
Did you say not soon?
No, we're going to do it pretty soon, but we want to have high bit rate, and we don't want you to give that to us until we tell you.
Okay. I think I'll go back and try to undamp up there. Do you have anything more for the Command Module?
We're discussing two items, but we don't have them ready right now. [Pause.]
One of them, I hope, is a foolproof alignment procedure. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jack. Just for curiosity's sake, does FIDO have any information as to whether that helium ... that SHe tank dump affected our trajectory at all? [Long pause.]
Okay, Aquarius. Our tracking data shows that since the helium dump, our entry angle has not changed from its value of 6.24, and somebody calculated that if we had a propulsive vent, that helium could roughly, at the maximum, only impart a Delta-V of a half a foot per second or less, anyway. But we're continuing to track and as soon as we get some more info, we'll pass it along.
Okay. That's swell, Jack. Thank you.
Sure.
Your 6.24 sounds good. [Long pause.]
I'm still awake, I guess. [Pause.]
They said that it would be a while because they want to get high bit rate. They don't want to put high bit rate. [Garble].
Okay, Aquarius. We're ready. So we want some high bit rate. To do that, go over to panel 16 under Comm and close the Primary S-Band Power Amplifier. On your Comm panel ...
Okay. Okay, Jack. Wait 1. While ... I'd like to get the whole crew up for this if you don't mind.
Okay.
[Garble] they're ready to start. Yes, you want to get Freddo up. [Pause.]
We want to transfer some power ... I want to go to high bit rate here first, then want to transfer LM power to CSM, Fred. [Pause.]
Okay, Jim, I'll give you the Comm.
Aquarius, there's no great big rush. If you want to let Fred come up to speed slowly, why maybe that'll help out. [Long pause.]
Okay. [Garble]. [Long pause.]
And Houston, Jack is showing Fred the procedures before we start up. [Pause.]
Say again, Jim.
[Garble].
Aquarius, How do you read?
Loud and clear.
Okay. I'm hearing you now. I think I missed your last transmission, Jim.
Okay. Jack is showing Fred the procedures. Want to get him familiarized with them, and how to get out of any problems before we proceed.
Roger. No rush. Just let us know when you're ready. We don't want old Freddo to slip a gimbal there. [Pause.]
Yes. We're watching him.
Boy, if you took 120 hours out. Oh. [Garble]. Okay. [Garble]. Have I done what? [Long pause.]
Houston, Aquarius.
Hello, Fred. Go ahead.
Okay, I guess the only question I have is in the first ... the very first portion involving the LM here where it has me turn on the only Bat 6, and then turn off all the Descent Batteries. Are you still reading me?
Okay. I read you until after turn off Bat 6 ... Correction, turn on only Bat 6.
Okay, the question is "Only one Ascent Battery Bat 6 on the line," immediately followed by turning off four Descent Bats. Is that correct?
That's affirmative, Fred. That question has been banged around and we decided to go that way. [Long pause.]
Let's see, we will be powering other Bus via the Cross Tie Balance Loads breaker. Is that correct?
That's affirmative, and we're reading a current of 11 amps right now. [Pause.]
Okay. Okay. I guess I'm ready, then. That's how many amps?
And after you turn Bat 6 on the line, you might as well take a look at the Bats 1 through 4 and so forth, and make sure that it's okay to turn them off. [Pause.]
Roger. Are your ready, gang?
Yes, we're ready for the Power Amplifier and the High Bit Rate, and Normal Voice, on the Function switch, please.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, gang; we've got High Bit Rate, now.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, we see Bat 6, On, and it looks good, Freddo.
Okay. Am I cleared to proceed with the next step, getting 1, 2, 3, and 4, Off/Reset?
Affirmative. You're cleared for Bats 1 through 4, Off/Reset.
Okay.
Okay. Still looks good. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. We need a call from you when to have Jack to proceed up into the Odyssey and start up there. [Pause.]
Okay, Aquarius; and Jack can get with it right now.
Okay.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We've completed the powerup and things look good upstairs. Are we Go for proceeding with battery charge? [Pause.]
Okay, Aquarius; you're Go on the battery charge.
Roger.
Boy, this is really a switch, isn't it, Jack? [Pause.]
That's an understatement. You're not known for that.
Yes. I think if you add up the ... Yes ... if you add up the operating time, I think the LM beats the CSM by a considerable margin on this flight. [Long pause.]
Grumman just hired you.
Yes. [Long pause.]
You're out there at 134,000, coming in at about 4,900 feet a second. [Pause.]
Very good.
The Supercrit tank went off at about 1937 just about like it expected.
Yes. It ... it also must of not did very much, except the rates. I was asleep then and I didn't hear a thing. [Pause.]
Is the command ... Service Module still venting? [Pause.]
Jack said it was just before he went up. Right now, the Sun's over there, and I can't really tell ...
And...
... I'll look again in a minute.
We asked him a long time ago if he was able to see any stars out the optics. I don't think we ever got an answer.
Okay. [Pause.]
That's a pretty good sleep station I had rigged up, Jack. I took one of the sleep restraints out of the Command Module, zipped up in it, and then hooked the tie, right at the top of the zipper, onto the LM upper hatch handle. So it kind of held me there, and then just drifted up in the tunnel upside down with my face toward the hatch, so the sunlight didn't get in my eyes and that worked pretty good.
Did you sleep pretty well that way?
Yes, no problem at all.
Is Jim sleeping that way now, or is he standing next to you?
He's standing next to me.
About time for him to go to bed.
Okay. The voltage upstairs is 34.3 and the charger is reading 2.5 amps.
Okay 34.3 and 2.5. And [garble] says [garble] ...
... pretty cold. Good.
Say again your last.
They came ... both came down here rubbing their hands, shivering. It's pretty cool upstairs. [Pause.]
Are you keeping warm in the LM? [Pause.]
Yes. It's pretty reasonable down here. [Long pause.]
Okay. And right now, it looks like [garble] right now, it looks like the Command Module isn't venting, Jack, so I'm going to try to take a look at the optics.
Okay. You say it is not venting?
Yes. That's the word. We've just looked through the AOT and you can't see anything back there.
Okay. And everything's fine in El Lago.
Very good.
Aquarius, we're ready to secure the high bit rate.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Houston, Aquarius; how do you read?
I'm hearing you with a lot of background noise, Freddo.
Okay. How now? I just switched Omnis again.
Okay. Stand by. [Long pause.].
The CMP is dotting across there. You'd be amazed at how proficient you get at transfering to the tunnel after the first 1000 times. [Long pause.].
I didn't get your last there, Freddo. We'd like you to verify that your Power Amplifier circuit breaker is open. [Pause.].
Okay. That's verified. Power AMPL breaker is open.
Roger. [Pause.]
Okay, Jack; that's 34.6 volts and just a little bit under 2.5 amps.
Okay, Fred. I copied 2.5 amps. Say again the volts, please.
34.3 and that was just a little bit below 2.5.
34.3; thank you. [Pause.]
Okay. [Garble] point [garble]. [Long pause.]
Freddo, I didn't copy the last. Say again the voltage, please. [Pause.]
Okay, and the voltage is 34.6 ... 34.6, amps slightly less than 2.5.
34.6 and a little below 2.5. Thank you.
We're ... the way we are torquing around to the side here, Jack ... We are getting some intervals where I can't hardly get to it with either of the Omnis.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Hous ... Aquarius.
Okay. Jack reports from upstairs that he can see stars and constellations out of the optics but the Sun angle is such that it is reflecting off the LM ... portion of the LM quad and other thruster [garble] right now. [Garble] really moving around [garble].
Okay. The part I got was that he can see stars and constellations and there is some sunlight reflected off the quads. That's all I got.
Yes. The point being that, at least in the present orientation, you have to kind of wait until Sun isn't reflected off the LM to see them. [Long pause.]
Okay. What you're saying is you kind of have to wait until the ... there is no Sun reflection on the LM to see the stars. Is that right?
Yes. That's for the present orientation, of course. [Long pause.]
But later on, if you can stop it moving around and [garble]. [Garble].
Okay ...
[Garble]. [Pause.]
Okay, Freddo. And we need a volts and amps reading. [Pause.]
Okay. And bring it back upstairs. [Long pause.]
Okay. The volts, 35.0; amps, 2.4.
Okay. 35.0 and 2.4. Thanks, Fred.
The weather prediction for your landing area is still good; 2000 scattered, high scattered; 4-foot seas, 15-knots wind. There's a hurricane 500 miles to the west, which doesn't pose a problem.
A hurricane or a typhoon?
Belay my last. It's degraded to a tropical storm.
Aquarius, Houston. We need another readout amps and volts, and that will be our last one for a half hour. Over.
Okay. The reading is 37.8 volts, 2.3 amps. [Pause.]
Say again, Fred.
37.8 volts, 2.3 amps.
37.8 and 2.3. And that will be our last one for a half hour. Thank you. And I'm about to exercise my fifth general order here, and pass it along to Joe. [Long pause.]
Yes. It must be getting around a mealtime.
Aquarius, Houston. Over. [Pause.]
[Garble].
Okay. This is your friendly do-it-yourself kit Comm with a suggested procedure in the lithium hydroxide situation. You're looking good. We read 1.8 millimeters, and you do have sufficient LM [garble] to last you the rest of the flight. However, being on the conservative side, we would like to use one more set of Command Module canisters to guard against some possible problems with the LM, primary canister. And I have a simplified procedure for doing that, if you want to listen to it now. Over.
Okay. I think I read that you were ready. I forgot [garble] earphones. This simply consists of getting a second pair of cartridges out of the Command Module, putting one band of sticky tape, that is the gray tape, with the sticky side out, around the sides of each new canister near the top, taking a piece of EVA cue card and cutting it into four squares about 2 or 3 inches on a side, bending those at a right angle to form corner support, attaching them to the sticky tape, so that they'll stick up and overlap the old canister, and then simply putting the old canister next to the new canister and taping it up real good so it sticks together. The only other procedure is to remove the towel plug from the old cartridges and put it in the bottom of the new cartridge. And that's it. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. As I read you, we get the gray tape and fold it so that we get ... the back sticks around the outside of the canisters, then we mount to that four sides of our [garble] cards like our EVA [garble] cards; then we overlap those cards down around the base of the canister. Then we ... then we [garble] over the [garble] at the top. [Garble]. Then we take the towel from the old ones and put them in the bottom of the new ones. [Garble]. [Garble].
Okay, Fred. I think you got it. I didn't completely copy your readback, but it's just that simple. We're just putting the new cartridge ... the top of the new cartridge against the bottom of the old one, moving that towel plug, using the cue cards as little corner stiffeners, and taping her up.
Okay. The top of the new against the bottom of the old.
Roger that. That way you don't have to touch the hose.
Hey, for a change, I took the [garble] LM [garble] this morning, Joe.
Okay. Go ahead.
I got [Garble]. [Long pause.]
I'm afraid I didn't copy that, Fred, and while I was listening, EECOM told me that he'd like another battery charge [Garble] readout.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go.
You want us to start on this lithium right now, Joe, or is it necessary?
It's not time-critical, Fred, but if you have the people awake now, you might go ahead and do it. Incidentally, you probably know this, but the next several hours are going to be pretty quiet from our point of view. We're working on the entry procedures and should be ready to read them up to you in about 8 hours; and between now and then there's not an awful lot going to be going on, so you guys could be catching up on your sleep schedule. Over.
Okay, Joe.
And we would like another readout on the amps and volts. [Pause.]
Roger.
Okay. The volts, Joe, are 38.9 and the amps are 1.9. [Pause.]
Okay. Copy that, Fred. Thank you very much; 38.9 and 1.9. And EECOM is simply making as smooth a plot as he can to verify the amount of amps we're putting back into the battery. That's why he wants it at half-hour intervals. If that schedule begins to interfere seriously with your rest cycle or so, give us a call. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
Yes. Jim's sleeping now, and Jack and I are awake and I just finished sleeping around, I guess, about another 5 or 6 hours, so I'm not particularly inclined to go back to sleep right now.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. We've got one of them ready to go, and it looks like we could do a pretty good job just using the tape strips. First combining them together and then just using a piece of paper and the bag [Garble] get a pretty good seal [garble].
Hey; okay, Fred. We suspected that you'd gotten at least one on. We've noticed a partial pressure drop from the 1.8 to 0.8, which is real good.
Okay. You might run that by the CPCB and see if they approve our in-house [garble]. [Pause.]
Roger that. [Long pause.]
Aquarius, Houston. [Long pause.]
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Roger. We're convening the CPCB on that change, Fred, but Flight has given you an interim go ahead. Over. [Pause.]
Okay.
And, how do you read now?
Not too bad, Fred..
Okay. We've got both canisters completed now.
Okay. Roger that, Fred. And you're reading 0.1 again on the CO2. Incidentally, are you guys having good luck getting water out of the Command Module?
We ... We haven't tried that yet today.
Okay. [Pause.]
Yes. This is quite an apparatus hanging on to these hoses now. And that ECS design engineer [garble] because it sure seems to work.
Roger that. [Long pause.]
And, Aquarius, Houston. At your convenience, we'd like another volts and amps readout.
Okay.
How do you read, Joe?
Pretty good, Fred.
Okay. Volts, 39.0; amps, 1.7.
39.0, 1.7. Thank you.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead. You're pretty weak.
I didn't call you, Joe.
Say again.
I didn't call.
Oh, sorry about that. Incidentally, Fred, if switching Omnis every couple of minutes bugs you, you can skip it for now. We can always wait until you come around.
No, it doesn't. This is Jack, Joe. Fred [garble]. It doesn't bother me at all. [Pause.]
Okay.
Just happy to know that you're standing by.
Roger that. Except I'm sitting by. [Pause.]
Did that CO2 drop?
Joe, how far out are we now and how fast are we closing?
Okay, Jack. The plot shows you about 130 000 miles out, which is about, gee, 10 000 closer than you were when I came on a couple of hours ago. And let me check with FIDO for your rate of closure. [Long pause.]
Hey, Jack. Over.
Go ahead.
Your smiling FIDO says you're making 5040 in a 5000-mile zone.
I can't [garble] I [garble].
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Joe.
Roger, Jack. Hate to keep bugging you, but we would like another volts and amps reading. Over.
Okay. We'll get it for you.
Good show.
Joe, did our sticky MOD on that ... those CO2 canisters work? I'm sorry ... [garble].
Jack, I think you asked if the canister MOD was working and the answer is, it sure as hell is. [Long pause.]
Okay, Joe. I got the voltage. It's 39.0 [volts] and 1.75 [amps]. [Pause.]
Copy 39.0 and 1.75.
Houston, do you read Aquarius?
Aquarius, Houston. That's affirmative.
Okay. We had a dropout there for a few minutes. [Garble] on either antenna.
Gee whiz, Jack, I ... when did it happen? Over.
Just now. I just got you back.
Okay. We had a handover, but that was about a half an hour ago, and I didn't call you on it. Let me check with INCO and see if he thinks everything's okay. Your Comm sounds just as good as it's ever been.
Yes. I'm in real good shape. [Long pause.]
Jack, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. We're checking into it. We think we lost lock in Madrid for a while, and we've got it back now.
Okay. Real fine. [Garble].
Okay.
You might also check with FIDO whether we [garble] perigee [garble]. [Pause.]
You're getting a little weak. Did you say you wanted to verify what ... what your vacuum perigee is? Over. [Pause.]
Yes. [Garble].
Jack, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. The good FIDO gives us a vacuum perigee at the present time of 23.6 with a flight path angle of minus 6.25 degrees. That's without a midcourse. He's kind of tossing around the idea of doing a midcourse-7 maneuver at 5 hours before entry. If we do it, it looks like it won't be more than 2 feet per second. Over.
Okay. [Long pause.]
And, Jack, Houston. We verified that that Comm problem was a ground problem. [Pause.]
Okay. Thank you. That FIDO is really cooking today.
Oh, he's having a ball.
It must be because we haven't made any waste water dumps.
(Laughter)
You can tell Jay and David that I went for a whole flight and didn't use the bathroom. [Pause.]
(Laughter) He copies that. David's here; he says you've kept him so busy he hasn't had time to work on his stereo all week.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Jack, we'd like another volts and amps reading at your convenience.
Okay, Houston. It's 39.2 volts; 1.6 amps.
Okay. Thank you. We copy; 39.2 volts, and 1.6 amps.
Right.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go.
I just relieved the watch; just thought I'd find out how things are going.
Okay, Jim. Good morning; and understand you relieved the watch, and the rest was kind of blurry. Did you have any questions?
No questions, Joe. Just one of those [garble] communications.
Okay. That was ... That was loud and clear, that one there. Now we don't have a heck of a lot going on as you know we're working on the entry procedures. I've got preliminary copies, but we're not ready to pass ... to pass it up to you. Looks like you're about 125,000 miles out, starting to ... starting to really pick up speed, and the Astros won last night, and that's about all I've got. Over.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jim. It's about time, at your convenience, for another volts and amps reading on the Command Module. For your information, we put 6 amp-hours back in the battery already and we've got about 14 to go. It's looking real good, and I also just got the word that the entry weather tomorrow is looking better all the time. Really looks great.
That's good. When I went to bed last night, [garble] a lot of rain [garble]. [Pause.]
Didn't copy that, Jim. Sorry.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. 39.2 on the volts; 1.4 on the amps.
39.2 and 1.4. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Roger. Just for your information, in case it happened when you were off watch, the master caution circuit breaker is still pulled, and we're seeing the ... the malfunction indication on the descent battery now, but all the parameters still look just as good as ever, and that's just for information.
Okay. I see the battery light flickering now.
Okay. Recommend you ignore it.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, it's volts and amps time again, at your convenience.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius. [Long pause.]
Aquarius, Houston. If you gave me those readings, I didn't copy them. Over. [Long pause.]
Houston, Aquarius. Do you read?
Aquarius, Houston. Okay; go ahead.
Volts, 39.3; amps, 1.25. [Pause.]
Okay. Copied 39.3 and 1.25. Jim, did Jack tell you what your trajectory looks like? Over. [Pause.]
Haven't got up to [garble] on it. How about giving me a rundown?
Okay. We are looking at a vacuum perigee right now of 23.6; flight path angle of minus 6.25; and if we decide we want to trim that up, we're looking at a midcourse of about 2 feet per second. Your consumables, of course, are getting better all the time; we've got 163 hours of water, 230 hours of oxygen, and 172 hours worth of electrical power. Over.
That sounds good.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim. We would like to get another check from you on the propellant tank temperatures, as we did yesterday. And the procedure is to, on panel 16, circuit breaker Propellant, Display/Engine, Override/Logic to close. Then go to your display and read the tank 1 and tank 2 temperatures for us, and then open the circuit breaker again. Over.
Okay. I'm closing now ... the Display/Engine, Override/Logic.
Roger. [Pause.]
Okay. And the reaction control temperatures are 65 in A and 65 in B.
Okay, Jim. We'd like the descent tank temperatures, too. Over. [Long pause.]
67; oxidizer is 63; descent tank 1 [garble] is 64; the oxidizer is [garble] Did you copy? Over. [Long pause.]
Hello, Houston. Did you copy the ... the DPS display temperatures?
Jim, I copied 63 and 64, which I think were the descent 1 temps, and that's all I got.
Okay. I'll go over it again. I'm on descent 1, now and fuel is about 64, and oxidizer is 65, and I'll go to descent 2 ...
Okay. Thank you very much ...
... our descent 2. Okay. I've got descent 2 now right up on 67 and 66.
Roger. We copy that, and once again we'd like to get the volts and amps check in the Command Module. Over.
Okay. I'm going to go up there and get it. Jack is ... and Fred are asleep, so I'll be off the air a minute.
Okay. Real good.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go.
Volts, 39.3; amps, 1.2 zip.
Okay. We copy 39.3 and 1.20. And, Jim, I've got one more item for information for you. At ... In about 45 minutes or so, you will get an H2O quantity caution light on the descent tank. We expect this. It occurs at 16 percent. And it's no problem, because we intend to run the tank dry just for drill. To reset the ... the light, on panel 2, just set the O2 H2O Quantity Monitor to the Caution/Warning Reset position and the light will go away. Over.
Okay. I understand. We're going to get a H2O warning light here shortly, and I'll reset it. [Pause.]
Okay. Good deal.
Houston, Apollo 13.
Aquarius, Houston; go ahead.
Okay, Joe, we got the Water warning light.
Okay. Roger that.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim. The experts would like another volt and amp reading. [Pause.]
Okay; have them stand by.
Okay, no rush.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston; go ahead.
Voltage is 39.3; amps, 1.26. [Pause.]
Copy 39.3 and 1.26.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston; go.
Joe, you might pass to our friends in Crew Systems that lunar boots make great footwarmers.
I guess you need them up there, too. Is ... is anybody sleeping in the Command Module right now, Jim?
Negative, Joe. It's just too cold in there. I got Fred stashed over here to my left. He's asleep and Jack's [garble]. [Pause.]
Roger. [Long pause.]
You can eliminate the chilldown procedure for reentry.
(Laughter) Well, we figured we were in that mode now.
Aquarius, this is Earth. Over.
Go ahead, Earth; Aquarius here.
Roger. Earth is here, also; and, Jim, it is time for another one of those volt/amp checks. For your information, we've got that battery back up to 30 amp-hours now. Over.
Hey, that sounds great. Jack's gone up to check it.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Aquarius, Earth.
Go ahead.
You know, I think Aquarius is [garble].
We've got [garble] now, Jim; I'm sorry.
I said Aquarius [garble].
Roger. [Long pause.]
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead.
Voltage 39.3, amps 1.26.
Okay. Copy that, Jim. [Long pause.]
Jim, Houston. Have you guys put on any extra clothes to try and ward off the nip of Jack Frost? Over.
Well, the lunar boots and two pair of underwear, and everyone is [garble] crawl into their sleep restraints. [Pause.]
Yes.
We're a little reluctant to break out the suits.
Yes, that's understandable. You can always use them if you have to. I guess it's pretty hard to get extra coveralls on, huh? [Long pause.]
Well, Joe, I didn't think we had any extra inflight garments aboard, but we're going to check right now.
Well, stand by.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Jim, we noticed you just went to Auto and back to Close on the Suit Relief valve. Is everything okay?
We didn't do that intentionally. Stand by.
Okay, maybe you didn't. Incidentally, you're less than 24 hours to go.
Roger. What happened was, our lithium hydroxide device here got caught in the suit relief valve. It is closed now. That's where you want it, right? [Pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
And, Joe, just a reminder; now that you mention it ... that it's less than 24 hours to go, what I'd like to do, and I have aboard all the procedures that you are working up; so I can run through them with the crew, and make sure that we get all our signals straight.
Roger that, Jim. We are trying to get the procedures finished and up to you as quickly as we can. They exist. What's going on now is the guys are running them in the CMS/LMS, integrate, to make darn sure that the attitudes are correct and the time line is nice and relaxed and all that good stuff. And they won't be finished that run for another few hours. However, we expect to have an overall time line and a sequence of events for you before that time, and we'll start with the procedures as soon as they get ready. Over.
Okay. That's good. I think [garble] ought to go back to the original procedures we have on board and modify them as we have the time to. [Long pause.]
Okay, Jim. Roger. We're going to do that to the maximum extent possible. And it looks reasonably feasible. To begin with in the Command Module we're going to have to send you some separate sequences for powering it up a little bit at a time. The closer we get to entry the more we get on the checklist. By the time we're about at EI minus 45 we're on the checklist all the way.
Okay. [Pause.]
And just as a reminder, don't forget our stowage problem. We ... We still have to do quite a bit of stowage of the drogue and probe in the LM, and, et cetera.
Roger that. We've got a team working on that, and incidentally, one of the information items that they want to know is which lithium hydroxide containers in the Command Module are empty. They just want to know that for weight and balance ... and there's no rush about it ...
[Garble].
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Another note of interest to the crew systems people ... Tell them that they don't have to bother putting the refrigerator onboard. I just brought out some hot dogs, and they're practically frozen.
(Laughter) Okay. We copy that, Jim.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We'd like another volt, amp reading, Jim.
Okay. Stand by, Joe.
Roger.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Jim.
Volt 39.4, amp 1.23.
Okay. Roger that. And, Jim, we ought to have a ... an entry time line to discuss with you in one hour.
