Okay, we're Go at six.
You're Go at 6 minutes, 13.
Booster, you don't see any problem with that though, do you?
Go at 6.
Negative, not right now, Flight. All the other engines are Go.
And, Houston, what's the story on engine 5?
We'll come up with some updated times.
Flight, confirmed. Number five engine down.
Jim, Houston. We don't have a story on why the inboard out was early, but the other engines are Go and you are Go. [Pause.]
Rog.
Roger.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Should be no problem, CapCom.
Four [garble, may be 'gimbal'], Flight.
Okay. We're - we're a little bit low on H-dot, now, but that's to be expected.
Roger. How's the trim looking?
Trims look good, Flight.
Okay. We're Mode II, gentlemen, Mode II.
Okay, Booster, you want to give me a cut off time and I'll...
Coming up with it, Flight. Stand by.
CMC's Still Go, Flight.
Rog.
13, Houston. Still looking good. Your gimbals are good; trim is good.
Roger. [Pause.]
Flight, Booster.
Go.
Best estimate now for S-II shutdown is 9 plus 48.
We just checked the trim. It doesn't fit.
9 plus 48 for S-II shutdown, and level sense arm is what?
Nominal 8 plus 38, Flight.
8 plus 38, okay, CapCom. Go up with that, please.
13, Houston. Level sense arm time, 8 plus 38 nominal; S-II cut-off time, 9 plus 48. Over. [Pause.]
We're Go at seven.

Didn't like that inboard.
Okay, we're 1,400 feet a second low on Vi. That's not too bad.
Okay, how's it look, Booster?
We're Go, Flight, with engine five out early.
Watch the trajectory closely, Jack.
Okay, shouldn't be any problem. Your first thoughts here on TLI, should it?
Yes, [garble].
We'll have to check it, Flight.
Okay.
We're right at 8 [garble] - H-dot is a little bit low; Vi is low, but that's understandable.
Okay.
You're S-IVB to orbit capability now.
13, Houston. Looking good at 8 minutes. [Long pause.]
13; Roger.
How's those systems, Fred? Are there any...
They're looking good.

Okay, CapCom.
13, Houston. At 11 minutes, you're Go. Predicted cut-off on the S-IVB is 12 plus 34. Over. [Long pause.]
Africa over, Flight.
Roger, Africa.
And Booster, understand that your first cut is that you should be able to make TLI.
[Garble]
What?
That's affirm, Flight.
[Garble] to be evaluating that.
Rog, thank you.
Okay, going to [garble] dead band now, guys. We're 102.5 - shutdown velocity...
Flight, FIDO, we've got good agreement. All sources. We're Go.
Okay. How's the Vanguard doing?
It's still not looking very good. It's really noisy right now, Flight. We'll have to evaluate it later.
Okay.
25,562.
Let you go with Bermuda.
Apollo 13, Houston. You're Go at 11½, and predicted cut-off time is 12 plus 34. Over. [Pause.]

We've got a Go orbit, all sources, and the booster has been safed.
Okay, CapCom. The orbit's Go, The booster's safe.
Apollo 13, Houston. You have a Go orbit all sources, and the booster is safe. Over.
Go orbit and the booster is safe. Thank you, Joe.
Don't mention it. [Long pause.]
13, Houston. We copy your Noun 44.
Okay, Joe.
Okay, Guidance. You see the - is it too early yet for the Verb 66, 45?
He hasn't completed it yet, Flight. He's getting it set up at this time. Terminated P11 and he's working on it.
Okay. Booster, How's the S-IVB look?
Looks good, Flight. We're just about configured for it, but I'll be right back with you.
Okay.
Verb 66 and 45 complete, Flight.
Roger that.
