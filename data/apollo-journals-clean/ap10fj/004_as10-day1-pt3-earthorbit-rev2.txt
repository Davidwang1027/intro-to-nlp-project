Hello, Apollo 10. Houston through Guaymas. Standing by.
Roger, Houston. Reading you loud and clear.
Roger. You're five-by.
Okay. We are ready to extend the docking probe when you are.
Roger. Stand by.
We've got to get a Go on that temperature measurement.
10, Houston. We're ready for you to extend the docking probe. And, you'll have to stand by on the temp until we get high bit rate.
Roger.
Okay. We'll count down: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Extend.
Roger. Copy.
Barber pole, then gray.
Roger.
We could feel a klunk.
Roger.
We could hear it go out. I believe it's all the way out.
Roger. You say you heard it go out?
Yes.
Okay. Key, we will have the P27 for you over Bermuda at about 1 plus 40. And, we've got a TLI plus 90 PAD, if you are ready to copy, Gene.
Stand by.
Roger. TLI plus 90. Go ahead, Charlie.
Roger. TLI plus 90, SPS/G&N: 63556; minus 1.48; plus 1.35; 003:55:44.87; minus 0548.4, minus 4 balls 1, plus 6623.2; 180, 239, 001; apogee is NA; perigee is plus 0017.5; 6645.8; burn time 07:37; 6619.9; 24; 208.7; 16.7.
Hello, Houston. This is 10.
Go ahead.
Houston, we lost S-band for a second, there. I got everything through HA, NA. Go after that.
Okay, Gene. HP is plus 0017.5; 6645.8; 07:37; Delta-VC 6619.9; 24; 208.7; 16.7; boresight star is Shaula, and it's left 008, down 27; minus 26.05, minus 025.00; 1122.9, 33993, 012:55:35. Okay, your set stars are Deneb and Vega at 067, 283, 337; no ullage. Your P37 for TLI plus 4 is 00630, 6373; the longitude is minus 165; GET 400K is 00:22:21. Ready for you readback.
Tell him he's reading way too fast.
I got it.
You talk to him. Tell him he's reading too fast.
Okay, Charlie, here it comes. SPS/G&N: 63556; minus 1.48; plus 1.35; 003:55:44.87; minus 0548.4, minus 4 balls 1, plus 6623.2. You with me?
Go ahead.
180, 239, 001; Apogee is NA; perigee is plus 0017.5; 6645.8; 07:37; 6619.9; 24; 208.7; 16.7...
Give me the camera.
boresight star is Shaula...
Here.
left 008, down...
We're all set to shoot this stuff down.
27; minus 26.05, minus 025.00; 1122.9; 33993, 0...
12:55:35. Still there?
Keep going.
Okay. Deneb and Vega, 067, 283, 337; no ullage. TLI plus 4, 00630; 6373; minus 165; 0 22 21. And, you are...
just a little bit fast on those reads, Charlie. I was barely able to keep up with you.
Roger, Gene. Sorry about that. That was a good readback, and we got the TLI PAD if you are ready to copy.
Tell him to take it a little slower.
Stand by one.
Yes, I did.
Okay. I'm ready.
Okay. Time base 6p, 2:24:25; 179, 116, 3 balls; burn time, 05:43; 10437.6; 35603; 358, 151, 040; TLI plus 10 minutes, abort pitch angle is 267. Standing by for your readback.
Okay. TLI is 2:24:25; 179, 116, 000; Burn time is 05:43; 10437.6; 35603; roll is 358, 151, 040; and our TLI plus 10 minutes, pitch is 267 degrees.
Roger. The burn looks real - going to look real nominal. The SEP angles - everything is real nominal and your backup S-IVB cue cards are okay. Pitch and yaw and everything looks good.
That's great, Charlie. We ought to be coming over the top here pretty soon.
Roger. You ought to be right over.
10, Houston. On the TLI, we've got a string of nines on the probability for a guided cut-off.
Can't beat that.
Sure can't.
You're doing good work so far, Charlie.
So are you guys. Man you guys sounded ecstatic on that boost.
Babe, you ain't seen nothing until you've seen that S-IC stage.
Would you care to elaborate?
I will later.
Okay.
It's real smooth between the start and the end of its burn.
Yes.
There's no doubt the whole structure unloaded on us when we staged.
Yes, you kind of felt like you were pulling yourself off from the 8-ball, there.
No, more like a structural pogo. We'll tell about it later.
Okay. Chris says "Don't forget now, it's 8 days".
Okay.
Hello. 10, Houston. We got our load at Bermuda, We're ready to go, if you'll give us Accept.
In Accept, and we're in P00. Go.
Roger.
Hello. Apollo 10, Houston. We got the load in okay. You can go back to Block. The computer is yours.
We've get Block.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 10. What does your latest orbit show?
Stand by.
10, Houston. We're showing you in a 107 by 104.
Roger. Thank you.
Hello. Apollo 10, Houston. We think that your Primary Evap is definitely dried out, so we're going to leave it as is, and if we have to, we'll, reservice after TLI.
Okay. After I closed the valve, it started off to low peg and now has drifted off to a reading of about, 0.24.
Roger.
Roger. The spacecraft temp has started to cool down. We feel real good in here.
Roger. Good, Tom.
10, Houston. We'll have you through the Canaries until 1 plus 55, except for about a 30-second break at about 1 plus 43, when we go from Vanguard to the Canaries...
Roger.
a short break at about 1 plus 49, excuse me.
Roger.
10, Houston. How's the view from up there? Your windows all look good?
Windows are all clear. Gene has a white streak across his external - Just a white streak on the right window.
Roger. We copy. How wide is it? Is it significant at all, Tom?
No, Charlie. It looks like someone took a little thin paint brush and just stabbed it across from top to bottom on the right-hand window.
Roger.
And, 10, Houston. With the high bit rate, that probe temp is hanging right in there at 85.
Thank you.
Hello, Apollo 10. Houston through the Canaries. Standing by. We are Go for the Pyro Arm at any time.
Okay, Charlie. I'll get it right now.
Okay.
SECS Logic to Batt A and B on the Breakers; Logic 1 and Logic 2 are coming Off.
Roger. Stand by.
10, Houston. Would you verify that the SECS Arm Breakers are Closed?
Roger. SECS Arms coming Closed now; A, B.
Roger.
And, 10, Houston. Your Pyro system looks good. We're Go.
Okay. I'll arm it just before TLI.
Roger, Tom. And we'd like you go Up Telemetry Command Reset at Canaries LOS.
Say again?
Roger. At Canaries LOS you can go Up Telemetry Command to Reset.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 10. We're donning our helmets and gloves now.
Roger.
10, Houston. Everybody in the room is happy as can be. You're looking great. We'll have LOS at Canaries at 1 plus 56. We'll see you over Tananarive at 2 plus 09.
All right; Tan. Roger.
Hello. Apollo 10, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by. We've got nothing for you.
Okay, Houston. We have our Pyros armed, and we're all set for TLI.
Roger. We'll try to come up through ARIA at about 2 plus 14, Tom. They say the circuit margins look good from ARIA 3. The other aircraft - It's sort of marginal, but we'll probably try.
ARIA at 2 plus 14.
Roger.
Hello. 10, Houston. Coming up on LOS at Tananarive. We'll give you a call through ARIA 3 in a minute or so.
Roger. We're all squared away for the burn, Houston.
Roger, Tom.
Hello, Apollo 10. Apollo 10, Houston through Aria 3. How do you read?
Roger. You're there, 10, but unreadable.
Hello, Apollo 10. Houston through ARIA 5. Do you read?
Hello, Apollo 10 Houston through Carnarvon Over.
Roger, through Carnarvon. The time base 6 started right on time, Charlie.
Roger. Good. Your S-IVB is looking great, Tom. It's pressurizing okay.
And I can see the pressure building up, and I'm at 5305 - 4, 5...
Mark.
53:05, counting up.
Roger. We're about 3 seconds ahead of you.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 10. Fuel tank pressure is up to 30.
Roger. Copy.
Mark.
Fifty-seven minutes, counting up.
Roger, 10. You're Go for TLI. S-IVB is looking as planned.
Good show. We've got the old 8-ball working on number 2, and powered up P47.
Okay.
Go.
13040 turns.
TVC Servo Power On.
S-II SEP light On.
Roger.
go.
Very well.
Max turn rate; you want 10 degrees?
Exceed 10 degrees, Very well.
SEP light Out. Right on time.
Roger. Copy.
Fuel lead in the starboard. Getting acceleration.
Roger.
