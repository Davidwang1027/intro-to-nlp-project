[Cough.]
Okay, Tom, let's just verify these last few things except helmets and gloves, huh?
Okay.
Mission time? Set?
Yes.
Event timer? Set?
Yes.
Overhead hatch locked?
Yes.
Overhead Cabin Relief Dump valve, Auto?
Let's leave it closed. We don't want any...
Okay. Well, put that lock in so it doesn't go to the Open position.
That one right there is Auto.
Yes.
Regs A and B, Cabin?
Yes.
Guidance Control, AGS?
Yes.
Mode Select, Landing Radar?
Yes.
Range/Altitude Monitor, Range Rate?
Go.
Rate/Error Monitor, Landing Radar/Computer?
Yes.
CDR, Rendezvous Radar?
Right.
Attitude Monitor, Commander PGNS, and LMP, AGS?
Go.
Rate Scale, 5 degrees?
Right.
X-Translation, 2 Jets?
Yes.
Balance Couple, On?
Yes.
Deadband, Max; Attitude Control, three, Pulse; Mode Control, both, Attitude Hold: You just turned AGS off, huh?
Yes. I don't want to hit the stick.
Okay. Turn these off for now, huh?
Yes.
Are you in jets over there?
I'm in jets.
When you go to Throttle, you've really got to go hard. Rendezvous Radar, Slew?
Yes.
ACA/4 Jet Enable, Okay. You want to put your AOT heater On before we undock.
Yes.
You can see our track light.
Oh, no. Oh, God, no. Oh, you son of a bitch!
Yes.
Helmets and gloves.
[Cough.] Oh, man, is that bright.
Tom, why don't you keep this over there somewhere.
Okay. I wish I had some tape.
I can't stay down without a restraint, can you?
What?
I can't stay down, here, can you?
You see our landing gear out there?
I can't - I'm not going to look out...
Hey, I can damn near see one.
You're in the shadows. I can't. Can you set up at f:11?
f:8.
Your f is f:8, huh? Oh, got this thing all knocked around. That's what I had.
[Garble] go ahead and put my helmet and gloves on.
There was something else I just wanted to do, and I don't remember what it was.
Give me a hand here, and I'll get this out of the way.
All in?
Yes. Tunnel lock.
Okay, when was undocking, 98:22?
Right. 98:22, and I'll give you a hack at 20 minutes to go. You've got 20 minutes and 30 seconds.
Okay.
Put your AOT breaker in, Tom.
Okay. I've already got my AOT heater breaker in.
Huh?
You want the AOT breaker in? You got it? [Garble]...
Looking right back at the Command Module, right now
3, 2, 1...
Mark it. We've got 20 minutes to go.
Okay. And you said you want to go 5 minutes early?
Yes, at least 5 minutes early, in case we have to go to some attitude. Okay?
Okay.
Hey, John, while you're sitting there, do you want to try VHF A Simplex again?
Roger. Let's do it.
Okay.
Going to VHF A Simplex now.
Snoopy, Charlie Brown, how do you read?
Beautiful.
Roger, I'm reading you loud and clear. How me?
I read you the same.
You're coming in great John.
Okay, John, let's try VHF - let's try the Duplex Ranging mode except I won't give you Ranging; I'll just give you Voice.
Okay. Let's go to Duplex at B, Okay?
Okay. John, how do you read us?
Read you loud and clear, Gene-o.
Okay, this is the mode we're going to operate in except my Transmit switch will be in Voice/Ranging instead of Voice, so maybe we're in.
Yes. What happened all of a sudden, like?
I don't know.
That could be what they were talking about on this corona build-up.
Okay, John, let's go to VHF Simplex Data. That's where we should be now. Let's go back there.
Okay. A Data.
Are you in A, T/R and B, Receive, Tom?
On A, T/R and B, Receive.
John, how do you read us?
It's loud and clear.
Okay, let's stay here.
John, you're so loud in these earplugs I have my volume down to 2. You're really booming through.
Good.
We ought to be in for six exciting hours.
It should be interesting.
Man, I hope that docking thing don't have anything to do with the probe working or not working.
Oh, yes.
How's Delta-P these days?
The tunnel?
Yes.
0.8, just what it was a couple or 3 minutes ago. It's still solid.
Looks like those three capture latches do a pretty good job.
Yes, they do.
John, I think 5 minutes should be enough for us to get squared away, right?
Yes, I hope so.
Or do you want to do it more than 5 minutes early, babe?
I'd kind of like to.
Okay, do you want - you say when, 8 or 10.
Okay, I'll make it, I'll vote for 10.
Okay, we're with you, we've got plenty of field.
Okay, let me start putting my helmet and gloves on, then.
We've got this 15 mark; we'll undock in 5 more minutes.
Roger.
How's that look?
Gene-o, yes, Gene-o, you're getting it.
That Sun could really be a bitch in a few more minutes. John, will you stand by to take over and vice versa?
John, what do you think about the Sun? Do you think that's going to be hurting you, babe?
Yes, but there ain't nothing I can do about it.
Let me know if you lose us in the - in the bright glint.
Okay, I won't turn that thing off if it's going to get in the Sun, Okay?
Do what?
I won't turn that other thing on if it's going to get the Sun on it. Okay?
Yes, don't turn it on until we make sure that there's no Sun on it.
Okay.
Just leave it covered up right now. Did you stick some tape over the end of it?
Gene-o did.
Well, Okay, just before you take it off make sure you don't turn the other settings. We're all set on the others.
The only thing I do is go to TV, right?
All you do is go to - take the lens cap off and go to TV. You may have to turn the horizontal adjust on your monitor a little bit. You usually do.
Okay.
Okay, 3 minutes to undocking.
Roger.
Do you want to use the Hasselblad?
John, what have you got for an AOS, coming around the horn? About 23? John, what do you have. For AOS, about 23?
Say again.
What do you have for AOS, about 98:23?
Yes, he said he'd pick us up at 98:25.
Okay.
Okay, 2 minutes, coming around to undocking. 02:30, pardon me.
Boy, that Sun is treacherous. Could you push way down and snap in, Tom?
There. Well, maybe I wasn't pushing hard enough.
Okay, when we undock, to review, I'm going to yaw right 120 and pitch up 90. Are you going to make any maneuvers at all after undock until I get around?
Roger. Now it's going to be different for you. Like I say, you're in a different attitude than you used to be.
Yes. But I still need to yaw right 120, don't I? I've got to let them match up with your X-axis.
Yes, you - yes, you - Well, I don't know- I don't think it's - it's not 120. I tell you what. Is that what you want to do? Match up with my X-axis and then pitch up?
Yes. I need to match up with your X-axis and then I'll pitch up to my Z.
Okay. Why don't you let me maneuver to 0, 0, 0 and then tell you.
Okay. I thought we weren't supposed to maneuver.
Not until after we undock, is what I'm saying.
Okay. Okay. We've got 1 minute to go, babe.
Roger. Docking Probe circuit breakers coming In.
Roger.
We'll go out for about 40 seconds and then kill our rates - our opening rates, Okay?
Okay.
30 seconds, John.
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
Go.
Now that wasn't bad, just a little more Delta-V. We opened quite a bit. It's faster than the simulator, babe. Halt. I'm thrusting up to kill it.
Yes.
Okay, I'm thrusting up to kill it.
We're still opening.
Read us, John?
John, do you read us? Oh, shoot.
Yes, I read you.
Okay, great.
Okay, now you want me to yaw right? Go ahead and start this...
Yes, take a look at my docking probe and see if it's [garble] extended all the way or not.
Okay. I'm starting to yaw right, babe.
Okay. I'm going to yaw to [garble] roll to 180 myself.
Get the Hasselblad, Tom, I'll catch him when we come around.
Okay, I've already got the thing out of it.
We're in a completely different attitude from where we were. Completely different I know what you mean about a completely different attitude.
Yes...
John, we're opening a little bit; can you thrust towards me?
Oh, shit, look at that.
[Garble.]
Is that going to be your Sep attitude, John?
Negative.
Okay, I'm going to have to roll around here and try to keep out of gimbal lock to stay with you.
Okay, I'm going to my Sep attitude now.
Okay. What is it going to be?
It's going to be 014.
I can't tell what data - anything like that over here.
Okay, it's just the same one that we had in the simulator.
Okay. You going to it now?
Yes. Why don't you pitch up, Tom?
This is wild, Gene-o. We've never seen anything like this before.
Pitch up. And get me out your front window.
It's Okay, I know, about the attitude we're going to be now.
The same attitude, Tom, as on your book there for undocking.
Yes.
Got him out there?
Yes.
Oh, beautiful. I can't see him from here, but if I can't...
I'm trying to match you, John. Should I be upside down to you, babe?
No, this is good.
Yes, you should be, but that's alright.
Okay, can you close with your plus-X, and we'll look at that probe.
Don't tell me this dammed thing isn't working again. God damn it.
You can take off your helmets and gloves.
Are you in your SEP attitude yet, babe?
Just about.
Okay, you need to translate a little laterally for me.
Okay, I'm coming - coming forward.
Okay. Did you get it?
They say f:8, but he's awful bright out there.
Yes.
You're out a little bit too far. I'll try to thrust in a little bit, but I - it really offsets me in pitch, as you can see. Can you thrust toward me?
Roger, I'm thrusting towards you.
Man, that fuel is going down like mad, too.
I'll take care of the up and down, John.
Take some at f:8 and f - oh, you're putting that up there. Taking you, John, babe, you're a weird-looking machine
[Cough.]
How's the landing gear look, José, down and locked? [Cough.]
Yes.
I'm going to take my helmet and gloves off, Tom.
Yes. We're going to take our helmets and gloves off.
Roger.
I'm drifting out laterally to you. Can you make one little thrust correction? Every time I do that it really costs me.
Okay, I'll get to you.
Okay. I'll take care of the up and down. That's real easy. [Cough.]
Tom, reset your...
John, you're the first vehicle photographed by another around the Moon. How does that grab you?
That grabs me good.
Can you come in a little ways here just slowly.
Yes. I'm coming in.
Gene-o, something is wrong with our alignment. We're going...
It's Orb-rate, Tom.
Yes. Okay. Right now we're going - John, right now I'm going BEF, right? You're going BEF, right?
Yes.
Yes, but we're not upside down.
Tom, that will be BEF...
Yes, but we're - that shows we're upside down.
I know, but that's wrong. ORB rate needle 100 - that's great. Now that's better. We're facing up in the air. That's [garble].
[Garble.]
Okay, babe.
That's good.
That's great! That's better, we're facing up in the air, that's BEF.
Yes. There we go.
That's BEF.
There we go. I believe that.
Okay, [garble]?
Okay.
It would be good if John could get a picture of us against the lunar surface right like this, you know it?
Yes.
Okay, I'm at the Sep attitude, Tom.
You're now at the Sep attitude, huh?
Now, I'm in Sep attitude. I can't see you. Will you come up a little bit?
Translate up. You need to translate left a little bit.
You mean right, don't you?
Okay. Yes, Okay, it'll be to your - right.
Okay, I can't see you and I don't know whether I am even closing on you or not.
Now I got you.
I'll take care of the up and down.
Okay, I'll get rid of - I'll get the left and right, and in and out.
Okay.
Your gear is all down and locked, babe.
Good.
You going to take a picture of it?
Yes, if I could see it, I could.
That's good.
Yes, now we're getting in pretty good shape, babe. You really make a beautiful background against the Moon down there, John.
I'll tell you, John, these pictures of you against that Moon ought to be fantastic.
We got some ice on our - on our urine dump area over there - under your head.
I'll tell you - If you get a chance, I think we're pretty well stabilized now, you can go ahead and flip on the TV and take off the cover.
Roger.
We ought to have a MSFN about now.
[Garble] antenna...
There goes your antenna.
Your antenna is going to Reacq, babe.
Okay, Houston, Charlie Brown on the high gain. How do you read? Over.
Houston...
Houston, Charlie Brown on the high gain. How do you read? Over.
Yes, we got him right away, Tom.
Hello, Snoop. How you doing?
This is Snoop on high gain. How are you reading, now?
Five-by. How me?
Reading you loud and clear. We're about 30 or 40 feet [9 or 12 meters] away from him. Been station keeping for about 5 or 10 minutes here.
Roger. Could you give us P00 and Data? We've got a load for you, and are you ready to copy some PADs?
I sure am. I'm going to give you P00 and Data.
And I'm ready to copy.
Roger, Gene-o. It's DOI's first PAD, and we've got three PADs for you, starting with DOI. I'll read them all - through all of them and then you can read me back. Okay? Okay.
[Garble] go ahead...

Roger. 100:58:25.20, plus 0...
Charlie?
Go ahead.
Okay. John said he's not reading you. While I'm copying this, he said he's got a picture of the LM if you want to look at it on TV.
We have it, Gene-o. We're ready to continue with Noun 81 if you're ready.
I'm ready to copy. Go ahead.

AOT breaker is in.
Okay, Charlie. I got everything except Delta-VX on Noun 81.
Roger. Delta-VX on Noun 81 is plus 01666. I've got a PDI abort PAD if you'll just stand by. Over.
I'm waiting for you.
Roger. Let me try to raise Charlie Brown.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Over.
Roger, go ahead. Go ahead, Houston.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Over.
Houston, this is Snoop. He's reading you loud and clear.
Roger. He's copying the PAD then; we're not reading him at all, Snoop, and I'm ready with a PDI abort PAD if you're ready to copy. Over.
Okay. PDI abort. Go ahead.
100:43:45.50; plus 00931, plus all balls, plus 3 balls 1.1 00931. Burn time is 0:22, 3 balls 283, plus 00931, plus 00000, plus 3 balls 22. NA on the rest of the PAD.

Houston, this is Charlie Brown...
Good readback, Snoop. Over.
Houston, this is Charlie Brown. Over.
Houston, this is Snoop. Charlie Brown's trying to call you.
You guys give me the Delta-Vs and times for the [garble].
Roger, Snoop. We don't read him. Charlie Brown, verify your S-band switch is in T/R. Over.
John, is your S-band switch in T/R, and I'll give you anything you need? Just ask. Go ahead.
Delta-Vs and the times for DOI and phasing.
Delta-Vs and times.
Okay. The time of DOI, Charlie Brown, is 099:46:00.89, minus 00699, plus all zeros, and minus 00138. That's Noun 81 for DOI. Okay. Phasing is 100:58:25.20. Noun 81 is plus 01666, plus all balls, and minus 00594. And verify your T/R switch is in S-band T/R, John.
Roger.
Okay, phasing is 100:58:25.20. Noun 81 is plus 01666, plus all balls, and minus 00594.
I got you.
And verify your T/R switch is in S-Band T/R, John.
Roger, I'm in S-Band T/R.
Snoopy, Houston.
Okay.
I hear them loud and clear.
Snoopy, Houston. And I'm breaking in. It's a ground problem with the C - with the CSM. We're losing his - We got the downlink to Goldstone, but we're not getting it here in the MCC.
Shoot, I could have told him that.
Okay.
I'll tell you, this comm has got to be fixed within the next couple of hours, Charlie, so tell them to get with it.
Roger.
Everything else is going good here.
How long to John's Sep maneuver?
Houston, this is Snoopy. Is that 69.2 by 57.5 good?
Stand by.
Snoop, Houston. We aren't with you on the 69.2. Say again.
I'm reading Verb 82 out of the DSKY 69.9 by - or 62.9 by 57.5.
Stand by. We'll have it for you.
Snoop, Houston. FIDO's checking. Stand by. Snoop, Houston. That's a...
The reason I asked is I saw...
Go on the apogee and perigee.
Okay.
Looks like we're pretty steady out here on the station keeping, John, once we got squared away on our attitude.
Okay, Tom, I've got 6 minutes and 30 seconds to Sep. 6 minutes and 30.
Okay.
Snoop, Houston. We got a beautiful picture out there of you.
Give me a mark at 6.
Roger. I'll - mark at 6 minutes.
Charlie Brown...
Okay. We're counting down.
...We finally got you. Over.
No, that wasn't 6 minutes.
What was it, José?
Okay. I've got 5 seconds to 6 minutes.
Okay.
Okay. Six minutes and counting down to Sep.
Got you, babe.
Charlie Brown, Houston. We're reading you five-by now. Over.
Roger. I've got 5 minutes and 45 seconds to Sep: 44, 43, 42.
We're right with you.
Houston, this is Snoopy. With that drift you saw, how do you expect our platform to be, how close to good alignment?
Roger. We expect very small torquing angles in all axes. Over.
That's good to hear. Thank you.
Well, I hope we can get back on the nominal after that insulation kind of goofed us up, Charlie. But everything's looking good here.
Time to get my AOT breaker in?
Yes.
Roger, Tom. Could you - One question on the tracking light. Have you tried it?
Stand by. John, there's the tracking light for you.
Yes! Please turn it off.
It works.
Great. Thank you. We saw it.
Man, it's just beautiful.
John, why don't you toss on your tracking light for a minute?
Oh, don't tell me this film is jammed again. [Laughter.]
What's wrong?
Oh, this bastard.
It should stay on about 4 times. Can you see it?
We got it.
Roger. That's mine. It may be underneath the vehicle; I don't think you can see it.
Yes. I saw one reflection here. We're Okay.
AOT is dirty as hell, I'll tell you.
I can't get this going. We're going to have to wind film here.
What are you going to do? I'd sure like to get him while he moves away. Where is he?
Yes.
Boy, that Hasselblad!
That thing failed three or four times already. Failed to work; let me put it that way. Does it work yet?
No.
Let me play with the son of a bitch.
Go ahead. Got 2 minutes.
Okay, John. It looks like about 2:30 [2 minutes 30 seconds] coming up set, babe.
Roger. I agree.
God-danged thing has failed about four times!
Houston, you can pass on to our Support Division this Hasselblad film pack has failed about three or four times on us.
Roger. Snoop. We copy.
We're still getting some pictures, though. The magazine and the camera's good - It's just the packing of the film in the magazines.
Roger.
Where'd the slide go; I'll take it off.
Son of a bitch! That's inexcusable. Get out here a million miles from nowhere, and the god-dang film packs won't work.
Suppose John's taking - there it is.
No, that's - God-dang it, Tom, I can't get the damned thing to work!
Okay, Houston, coming up on 2 minutes to Sep. How about a Sync Mark?
I can't get the son of a bitch to work. God...
Is this black and white? Try the black and white.
Roger, We copied 1 minute.
Roger. You're right.
Give me the black and white. Give me the black and white.
Big Brother's watching.
Keep up the good work, boys. You will never know how big this thing gets when there ain't nothing in here but one guy.
[Laughter.]
You will never know how small it looks when you are as far as we are.
[Laughter.]
Take him with that. It's not set right. Check the setting, Tom. I didn't set it.
Here's another black and white right here, in case that one doesn't work.
This one is working good now.
I don't know what the hell is wrong with that damned thing.
We got them.
Okay. Separation.
Okay. Can see your thrusters firing there, John, and we're moving away.
Okay. Show 5.3 on the DSKY and 5.0 on the EMS and I - Zero on the EMS. I'd be inclined to believe the EMS today.
We copy, Charlie Brown.
Okay, José. Say adios and we'll see you back in about 6 hours.
Rog.
Snoop and Charlie Brown, we see you separating on the big tube.
See you, John, [garble].
Roger.
Have a good time while we're gone, babe.
Yes. Don't get lonesome out there, John.
And don't accept any TEI updates.
[Laughter.]
Don't you worry. Until you get back, I ain't - I ain't copying any more PADs.
[Laughter.]
Houston, this is Charlie Brown. Over.
Get some good black and white of that.
Yes.
Go ahead, Charlie Brown.
Roger. While we were waiting to come over the hill, we checked out VHF and we're right now on VHF A - A and receive only B data.
You got your camera?
You seen the Hasselblad. Shit!
Beautiful. Sounds good. Thanks a lot.
Do you have the Hasselblad?
No, babe, you were just taking pictures with it.
And don't ask me to tell you what the dickens the trouble was.
Houston, one other interesting little fact. I could never get my AGS local vertical angle and Verb 83 [Request Rendezvous Parameter Display] to agree until after we undocked.
Roger. We copy that, Snoop, and so logged.
Charlie, how about giving me a 3 or 5 minute hack before LOS all the time today, will you, because this S-band's working so well I don't want to break it.
Roger, Snoop. Will do. Over.
Okay, there, Snoopy babe. Let's check out this duplex ranging. Okay?
Okay. I'll go to duplex ranging on your Mark, and we will be quiet and wait for your call.
Roger. Going duplex ranging, on my Mark.
Mark.
Okay, Tom, let's...
There he is right over the - right over...
Make sure you're not talking.
Yes.
You guys shut up, because I can hear you. You have to maintain silence about the ship on that VOX mode. I'll give you - I'm going to range a Reset right now.
Rendezvous Radar In?
How about that? 800, 700...
Got it John?
...420 feet, 540 feet - (130 meters, 165 meters).
Okay, babe...
...do you hear me right now? I just want to check out whether we're hot on ICS. Do you hear me?
Roger. I hear you.
Okay, we are hot on ICS in this mode; so how's the background noise?
I don't hear any background noise, just you.
Okay, well, we may just operate this way then.
Hey, John, if you get a chance, you can turn on the radar transponder and we'll correlate the VHF ranging with it.
Roger. My transponder is On. Transponder is On, and the Test switch is in Operate.
I should be getting a radar signal here and I sure don't.
You are in that stowed position?
Yes, I know. I pulled it up.
Hello, Houston. How soon will you have our new uplink on the CSM state vector up?
Stand by. We will have it in a moment.
[Garble.]
Man, this is serious.
Snoopy, Houston. We are ready with the load, P00 and Data. Over.
P00 and Data. You've got it.
It's going to be upside down, but...
We should be counting down to - to DOI, Tom.
John, can you get any signal strength on your transponder there? I've got you locked boresight on [AOT] - I don't get any rendezvous radar signal strength.
Okay. Am I below you, or above you?
No, you're right at me. Okay. Pitch up maybe a little bit.
Roger.
You get those breakers In, huh?
Yes, AC Rendezvous Radar.
Put that AOT Lamp breaker In for me, will you?
It's already in.
Now, right here.
Where?
What you...
Oh. I got two of them. Either one of them does it.
Oh, Okay.
Pitch up a little more now.
Say when.
Okay. I'm looking right at - I'm boresighted on your transponder; I don't get any AGC strength.
Okay, Tom. I checked it out this morning and AGC was good.
Look at the needles, babe.
Oh, come on radar. Work baby.
Houston, do you have us on telemetry? I can't get the AGC signal here, and we're only about a 1,000 feet away [300 meters].
Roger, Snoopy. We've been copying your problems. We are working it down here, and we've got your load in. The computer is yours again. Stand by on the radar.
Transmitter Power, Shaft Error, Trunnion Error. [Garble] What's that? Real good Auto Track.
We got - we're just bouncing around there, babe.
Come on, baby, lock on!
Nothing.
Are the breakers in over there?
Yes, I got AC Roll...
It passed the radar self-test.
Houston, we had a real good radar self-test. Everything worked. I'm getting transmitting power that's reading 3.2. We get the shaft error, the trunnion error, the AGC; I've got the needle boresighted and centered, but we get no AGC.
Roger. We copy. Your PGNS needles are moving?
Yes. I can Slew Up and Down, in High Rate and Low Rate; everything. I've got him boresighted there.
Roger. Stand by.
Houston, I'll run through the self-test again, if you think that'll help any, from this end.
Roger. Go down and look at it again. You might give it another try, John.
Okay.
So this is a No-Go for DOI.
Oh, come on, baby: doggone it!
You're boresighted right there; the needles are centered, and nothing.
My AC Rendezvous Radar A is In, and my PGNS Rendezvous Radar is In.
Break, break, Snoop - this is- correction - Charlie Brown, this is Houston. We need you in a Transponder position on the Systems Test before you get the proper readouts. Over. For the self-test of the rendezvous...
I'm in that Transponder position.
Okay.
Okay. I'm reading...
What happened?
...Test A is reading zero, but it was working a few minutes ago.
What did you do?
[Garble
Okay. I didn't get a fire then.
Test B is reading zero. It's also reading zero, but it was working alright a few minutes ago.
Roger.
On the original test self-test.
Roger. Stand by.
[Garble] on it, babe.
Sounds like his Transponder may be Out.
It sure does.
Yes. This thing is reading zero. Let me check the circuit breaker.
Roger.
Okay. The Rendezvous Radar Bus circuit breaker is In.
Roger. How about trying to recycle the power switch, Charlie Brown?
God-darn it, Tom. That's...
Hey, that did it you guys. It's on.
Oh, and I got signal strength, old buddy.
...babe, that's great!
What do you know about that?
And I've got 3.2 on my AG [garble].
You got so much AGC, I don't know what to do with it.
Stick this in your pocket. Babe, that makes...
[Laughter.]
John I could kiss you!
It was Charlie's idea to cycle the switch; that would never occur to me.
It was - it was Ed's idea...
Okay. We're locked on pretty good...
Charlie Brown, Houston. We're ready to go with your load if you'll give us...
Okay. I'm reading opening at 3.5 feet per second (1.06 m/s).
...if you'll give us P00 and Accept, Charlie Brown.
Okay. Okay.
You have it.
Let's do this.
No, that thing...
Verb 63.
Okay.
[Garble] verify those things right there.
Yes. Beautiful.
Oh, boy, I tell you - How's this look, Tom? I'm saying he's opening at what, 4.3 (fps)?
Yes.
And he's a half mile (0.9 km).
[Garble] Oh!
What you guys got for range?
Roger. We've got 2,500 feet (760 meters). We're going to get you some raw data here, John, and my optical boresight is absolutely fantastic. It's right with the needle.
It's got 0.37 miles (0.68 km). This is going to be very interesting. It keeps jumping.
This thing takes a long time, Tom.
Yes.
You need to go to LGC? No, you can't until you get Verb...
Point 4 miles (0.74 km).
Okay. That looks real good on my tape, here.
Okay, go ahead.
Houston, Charlie Brown. The reason I believed the EMS over the CMC was I had three-tenths of a foot per second [0.1 m/s] of PIPA bias before I ever started the maneuver. Over.
Here comes the lunar sunset.
Okay, John. We're out here in Earthshine.
Roger. We copy. Over.
How about turning on your flashing light, José? Beautiful. You've got a nice one. It looks like the old Gemini Agena, would you believe.
Have you got our light, John?
Roger.
We are reading 0.46 miles (0.85 km) at 3 feet per second (0.9 m/s).
And the AGS is right with us.
John, whenever you're satisfied with the ranging, I'd like to go ahead and start in on a P52 here.
Roger. You can go start on P52. I saw your tracking light there briefly, but I haven't seen it since.
I just turned it on. It's still on. Let me turn the docking light on.
Charlie Brown. Houston. CMC is yours.
Roger. Thank you.
John, do you see the tracking light now? It's on?
Can you guys see it flashing?
No.
No.
Oh, shit. Okay. You want to...
Okay, John. I'm ready when you are to VHF A Simplex and Data.
Okay. On your Mark, Simplex and Data.
And I'll wait for you to give us a call.
Okay. Simplex Data.
Mark it.
Snoopy, Charlie Brown. How do you read?
Roger. Loud and clear, John.
How us, John?
You're the same.
Okay. We're going to terminate our - our radar track here to go on a P52.
You had that sitting back here, Tom, like...
Yes.
...leaning into this thing.
I'll go to LGC.
Oh, I thought you were. Okay. I'm sorry. You should be in LGC before we do this.
I can slew it out of the way [garble].
That's alright. Leave it there. See whether it does it.
Nothing's done. Huh uh.
Okay. Plus 00000, Enter.
There it goes.
Okay, pull your breaker, Tom.
Okay, Rendezvous Radar there. Okay.
Okay, AOT Lamp breakers, Closed?
Yes. Are we out of contact with MSFN?
No, we've still got them. They're going to call us before we lose them.
Okay.
Charlie Brown, Snoop. You can go ahead and kill the tube any time you want to and put the cover over it.
Say again. Over.
Roger. You can go ahead and kill the TV and put the cover over the tube
Have already.
Roger, boy.
What kind of deal is that?
Are you in the forward position?
I'm in the forward position.
Okay, let's see what...
How's it look to you?
[Garble] 190 degrees roll, 40 - yaw to an Automaneuver.
Yes.
Okay, let's watch it real close. Okay go. Flashing 50 [garble] shows a 190 roll, which is good. Pitch is 41. It's going to take you around quite a ways and - Do you want to do it?
Go ahead.
Okay, ready. [Garble] the DAP's all set? Did you get the DAP set after undocking?
Yes, I set it after - I set it after...
For 2-1?
I set it, yes, 21002. Check it.
I follow your tracking light now. Are you able to do a P52 with that light on?
I think so, John. I'm going to try it.
That's beautiful. Can you see mine?
Oh yes, John. You're absolutely great.
Your maneuver. Yes, it's flashing about every second. Just beautiful.
Okay, let's maneuver.
Okay. We're going to Auto maneuver acquire a star.
Keep looking out the window to help me find this mother.
Son of a bitch. I've got a picture.
This reticle is terrible; it's got a - it's not smooth. It goes from very bright to dim.
We ought to turn some of these lights down.
I got you in the sextant, John. In my telescope, right now, you're passing through it.
Roger.
Boy, I'll tell you. That's black out there, isn't it?
Here comes Scorpio. That's what you head in. Stand by.
No other color to describe that.
Here it comes. Here it comes, babe; it's going to stop us. Watch it.
I'm not night-adapted yet, that's my problem.
Snoop, Houston. We've reached the limits on the high gain. Go to omnis. Over.
There it is, there it is.
Stop!
Charlie Brown, Houston. Pass to Snoop that he has reached the tracking limits on the high gain and please go to omnis. Over.
There it is - beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
And there's the Earth.
Give me PGNS pulse, babe.
Okay, you are in Attitude Hold [garble].
Beautiful, good alignment.
[Garble.
Okay. Hey - Hey, Gene-o, go to Omnis. Your high gain has reached its limits.
Okay, tell me how far it's off.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Pass to Snoop that we'd like...
I tell you, I've got a beautiful sight.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Pass to Snoop that we'd like...
Go ahead there...
Okay. I'm talking. [Laughter.] Pass the - pass the - on to Snoop that we'd like the aft antenna. Over.
Is it locked out?
[Garble] breakers here.
Here it goes.
Okay.
Roger. They want the aft antenna there, Snoop, babe.
Tell Houston I've [garble] S-band antenna breaker out [garble] side.
Do you want your...?
Oh, Tom, get a picture of that - the world.
I don't have any color!
There's the world.
We don't have any color.
John, we just saw the world and is it fantastic!
You want [garble].
Yes. I can see it myself. Hey, did you hear they want the aft antenna?
I'll give it to them.
Roger.
You blew your breaker?
[Garble] It's alright now though. I've put it back in.
[Garble] fuel, baby. You want to Enter to mark X and mark Y yet? Hey, how about telling me how far it's off.
Tom, it's drifting. Give me it so I can mark, quick. Enter. Proceed. 54.
Okay. Got one. Mark Y.
[Garble] You got one pair.
X up next.
X. Okay.
That makes two [garble]. Mark either one.
Okay, mark Y.
[Garble] is next, isn't it?
Yes.
[Garble]. That makes three. Mark either one.
Okay. X is next.
[Garble] better than in the simulator [garble] mark because, I'll tell you, they're right on it.
Okay. That makes four pairs - four sets; mark one more on each one.
Turn the outside lights off, Tom.
Okay.
COAS [garble] Altitude [garble]. Can you turn them down some more?
What? Which ones?
My side panel lights up there.
Okay. Mark Y.
Okay, you got them. Proceed.
How about Acrux (PGNS star code 25)?
Okay.
[Garble.]
Yes.
Acrux.
Now let's see what angle it wants. It may take us - what's that saying?
212.
212. Okay, we're Okay; go.
[Garble.]
Looks alright. Proceed.
Turn all the lights down a little bit, Tom, will you?
I got them. Something's wrong here. This damn thing won't...
You've got your [garble] in probably.
I don't have any of them on.
All these integral lights are what are killing me.
There. That really goes "boom, boom," doesn't it?
[Garble.]
Can you tell me how far it's off, for evaluation of our platform align? How far is the other one off?
[Garble] done enough alignment to do the mission right now, Tom. I'd say [garble] degrees on [garble].
Which one? Proceed.
They are both the same. Let me get [garble] on that.
[Garble] on [garble]?
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure either, but [garble] get the AOT, it isn't more than [garble].
[Garble].
[Garble] about [garble]...
10 star widths?
...which is practically as good as, you know, you can get an alignment on this [garble].
Hello, Charlie Brown. Houston. A couple of reminders. We'd like the Delta-VCG to go to CSM and the BMAGs to either rate 1 or rate 2; your choice.
Thank you kindly.
[Garble].
Roger. Roger. Out.
Ready to mark [garble]?
Yes.
[Garble] knew where Acrux was.
You mark yet?
Ready to mark Y?
Yes.
[Garble] Y.
That antenna banging the stops blew the S-band antenna breaker over here, so it will do it.
Ready to mark?
Go.
Okay, [garble]. I'm going to mark [garble].
Go.
Still ready to mark Y?
Still ready to mark.
There it is.
Okay. Okay, [garble] right?
[Garble] four right now [garble] second.
Okay.
Houston, this is Charlie Brown. What time is LOS? Over.
Roger, Charlie Brown. Coming up LOS to you 16 minutes and 30 seconds.
Mark.
And we'll see you AOS at 100:24.
Two more stars to mark. (Garble.) That should be (Verb) 54, there.
Yes.
Charlie Brown?...
Could you give me the LOS in GET?
Roger. LOS GET is 99:37:32. Over.
Roger. Thank you. Houston.
Mark Y and we'll see what happens.
Yes.
And, Charlie Brown, Houston. We noticed the readout temp(erature) a little high, and if you get a little stuffy in there, we recommend you activate the secondary evaporator and the secondary pump. And then when you cool down, you can just turn off the Evap and leave the pump running. Your choice. Over.
The cabin temperature is 74 and the suit temperature is 51. Can't beat that.
Go to Y.
Ready to mark Y?
Sounds like uptown. Over.
It's some place. I mean to tell you.
Okay, proceed.
And, Charlie Brown, if you have some good word from Snoop - We still don't have any data and if they pass on to you about the P52, we'd be interested. Over.
That's good enough.
That's good, Tom. Those are good marks. Are you ready?
Okay. 00, four balls 9. Okay. Go, Proceed...
Roger.
...Okay, minus 662 (roll torquing angle), minus 1...
Hey, Snoopy. How's your P52 going?
Just about done with it. Stand by 1.
Proceed, go.
Now, we want to double check with [garble] make sure.
And to save gas I'm going to call up...
Call up Acrux again.
[Garble.]
Okay. Okay. Auto. Go ahead; we've got 22 minutes to DOI. That does it.
Charlie Brown, Houston. You can go back to Block on your Up Telemetry switch.
Okay. I wouldn't want anybody to zip me in any bad data on the back side.
We are drifting around in the deadband, but if you trim it up, it'll go right through center [garble].
Roger.
I got you.
That's about half again as close as we come in before [garble] but it's drifted down. Watch.
Did you talk to Snoop there Charlie Brown? Over.
I got you. That's damn close. Boy, it's right in there.
Yes, [garble].
Hey, Snoopy. This is Charlie Brown. Over. Is Gene-o keying his mike all the time? Sometimes I hear him, and sometimes I don't. Maybe that feed-through problem isn't as bad as they thought.
No, I'm not, I'm not. No.
Okay, you can give me integral lights back. Here.
Let's get...
[Garble] problem isn't as bad as they thought.
...Let's get the DOI attitude first and then do the landing radar check, babe.
Let's check P30 [external Delta-V program] and P40 (DPS thrust program).
AOT Lamp breaker, Open?
Yes.
Okay. Okay, I've gone through P30 one time.
We been through it one time?
Yes, I looked at it once.
Let's go maneuver to the at - What was it? What did they give for roll, pitch, and yaw angles?
Okay. Roll is 0 and - and pitch is 275.
Roll is 0 and pitch is 275, huh?
Yes.
Look at that Earth.
[Garble.]
What happened to this pressure? Fuel pressure?
Shit!
Hello. Houston, Houston, this is Snoopy, over.
Houston, Snoop's calling you.
Charlie Brown, Houston. We don't read Snoop. We haven't locked up on his data yet. Over.
Hey, John, ask them if they've been monitoring our descent fuel pressure. Our gauge went to zero somewhere during the P52.
Roger. Did you hear that, Houston?
That's negative, Charlie Brown. Over.
They say, have you been monitoring their descent fuel? You've been monitoring his descent stage fuel pressure. His gauge went to zero during a P52... burn.
P52.
Roger, Charlie Brown, We have no data at all. Over.
The alignment. Okay, Snoopy. This is Charlie Brown. Houston doesn't have any data from you today, right now.
Okay, maybe I can try and get them some.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Tell Snoop to do a Verb 64 to get us to high gain, and we got another transducer that we can verify that pressure. Over.
Houston, you're looking at high gain right now, or you will be in a second? How about checking it? It's out on descent 1 and descent 2.
We can hear some gurgling.
Hold this attitude a second, Tom, so I can verify that mother.
I'm near gimbal lock. I don't want to [garble].
Okay. Charlie Brown, this is Snoopy. Will you tell them they're looking at high gain, to verify their transducer?
Charlie?
Yes, sir.
Snoopy?
Yes sir. Charlie...
Snoopy, Houston.
Snoopy is calling you, and he says that you have high gain.
Roger, We got the...
And they are looking at you right now with it.
Roger. We got the data, Snoopy.
Houston, Go...
Roger, we got the data, Snoopy, and the descent pressure looks fine. Over.
Okay, I figure it was a gauge because I got...
He said the pressure looks fine, Tom.
Descent 1 and descent 2 both out.
Descent...
We got data, Snoopy, and the descent pressure looks fine. Over.
...1 and 2 are both out?
Copy.
Okay. And you are giving me a Go on descent pressure. Is that correct?
That's correct.
They said both descent pressures look good there, Snoop.
Okay. I can read them, John. That's what I wanted to hear from them.
Snoop, Houston. Could you...
I don't kind of - I don't know exactly what kind of a...
Snoop, Houston. Could you give us your P52 results? Over.
Roger. Stand by.
Okay. The stars were 33 (Antares) and 25 (Acrux). Star angle difference was 4 balls 9 (000.09°). Gyro torquing angles are minus 668, minus 195, minus 055 (roll, -000.668° pitch, -000.195° yaw, 000.055°). Over.
Roger. We copy Snoop. Out.
Roger. And initial acquisition of the star for the docked IMU align look pretty good.
Hey, Tom, you want to get my Landing Radar circuit breaker Closed?
Okay.
Houston, this is Snoopy. When's AOS - or LOS, rather?
Roger. We're coming up on LOS for you at 99:37 - correction 99:38. We'll see you AOS at 100:26. Over.
Hey, Tom. What was your biggest Gyro torquing angle? Over.
I got them, Charlie.
Roger. Biggest Gyro torquing angle was - registered 1 minus 668.
Is that 0.66?
It was 2 balls 668, 2 balls 195, and 3 balls 55. All minus.
Roger.
Have you got that Landing Radar breaker In, babe?
Yes.
Okay. Mode Select, Landing Radar.
Radar Test, Landing?
Yes.
Reading 38.
Snoopy, Houston. We got us some word on your Hasselblad problem - on the magazine problem. We'd like you to react the magazine flag so that the red just disappears and no further. If this doesn't work consistently, then change magazines. Over.
They already know that technique [garble].
Well, that didn't work consistently, and that's why we changed magazines. Over.
Roger. We copy. Out.
Hello, Snoop and Charlie Brown, This is Houston...
Houston, you are satisfied with the descent...
Snoop, Houston. You are Go for a DOI. Recommend you check on CB 16 Display Engine Override breaker. It might recover your descent monitoring capability. Over.
Roger [garble].
And, if - Display Engine Override - Understood. Right there. Next one.
No, There's no breakers out there that'd hurt that, Charlie. I'm going, as long as you're satisfied, I'm going Omni this time.
Roger. We copy. Got 4 minutes.
Okay. I did - when I went in that P52 and when I slammed the S-band into the stops, I did pop my S-band antenna breaker under Comm on panel 16.
Roger. Copy.
Okay.
Okay, Tom. We got to hustle through this, babe. Landing Antenna, Auto?
Yes. Go.
Okay, Verb 60, and we'll wait. Might want to start getting your helmet and gloves on.
Yes.
Are you at the attitude, babe?
Yes, 275.
Okay, I guess we'll - that's right. You want to check the back of mine, Tom?
The what? There you go.
Snoop, Houston. We show 2 minutes to LOS for you. Do you read me? Over.
Snoopy, Houston wonders if you're reading him. I guess you're not, or you would answer him.
Charlie Brown, Houston. No sweat.
Okay, Snoopy. Charlie Brown. Do you read? Over.
Roger, John. We can read you loud and clear.
Alright.
We need to keep at least one set of communications open at all times.
Yes. I think that's a very prudent idea.
Somehow.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Forty-five seconds to LOS. You're still Go for DOI.
Roger. What - what is my P20 doing? Can anybody tell me?
Stand by.
Okay. How are we doing? Ready?
Well, it's made up its mind.
What are we doing, running?
Houston, and Landing Antenna test is complete.
Charlie Brown...
Where do you want to leave this? In Hover?
Charlie Brown, Houston. Charlie Brown, Houston. It's integrating a state vector, P20.
Go ahead.
You want to leave this in Hover? The landing...
Thank you.
What? Yes, yes. That's where it's supposed to...
To be in Hover.
Well, wait a minute. It goes to - Tom, read through. I don't know. I - I thought I got it - Let me go through...
You're on VOX.
Huh? I'm not on VOX.
You're on - Are you on Down-Voice Backup?
I got to talk to you, babe. I'm in a helmet.
Okay, but you were coming - you were transmitting to the ground, and everybody.
Double check that with your...
No. I know what we need for the - for the...
We've lost contact with the ground. Double check that.
Okay. We've got the 7 minutes. I know what I need for the a - Okay, I'm going to go ahead, and go up to throttle.
Whoops!
Probably got to wait until it runs: its course. Call them up again, Tom.
What's that? Verb 47?
Yes, 47.
[Garble]. Ready.
No, let me - Okay, now go ahead. Go ahead.
Okay, Proceed. We got to get in the P40 right away. Take a look at that attitude again.
Orb-rate, I should be looking at 090.
You're coming up to it. You can...
[Garble] looking about 285 right side up. Are you correct?
Yes, yes. We're Okay. Now the main thing is - what altitude should that landing radar be in? The last one is Auto. There is Auto?
Landing Antenna Descent for 10 seconds. Landing Antenna, Auto.
Okay, that's the last one. Okay. It's Auto.
It's Auto for this burn. It's Hover for the phasing burn, Tom.
Yes.
Okay. Let's start going through the 4-minute check.
Okay. I got to call P40 as soon as this bear gets...
I know it. Engine - Engine Gimbal, Enable?
Engine Gimbal, Enable. Yes.
Throttle, Min?
Throttle is Min.
Throttle Control - Throttle Control, Auto.
Yes.
Manual, Throttle, Commander.
Go.
Balance Couple, On.
Balance Couple, On.
Descent Command Engine Override, Off.
Go.
Engine Stop buttons, Reset.
Go.
Abort/Abort pushbutton stage, Reset.
Yes.
Temp Monitor, Landing Radar - screw it! Come on - God dang this son of a bitch!
Did you get that Verb 79 or did we do that?
It takes so long to do this.
We're down to 5 minutes.
Well, we'll be alright.
We ought to do that before 7 minutes anymore.
Hey, on rendezvous - that could screw us real bad. Get to an Auto maneuver.
Okay, it - it'll be off in a minute.
Snoopy, this is Charlie Brown. Over.
Go ahead.
Shit.
Roger. Do you have your [garble] on? Over.
Shit! Gene-o, look at that son of a bitch. We're gonna be...
It'll - it'll do it, Tom. Yes, John, we do.
It's taken us 3 minutes. Proceed. Okay.
0686 - You can give it to me. Real quick.
Okay. Minus 69.90.
Okay. Go.
Minus 14.1. Key Release. Proceed. Automaneuver.
AGS or PGNS and everything squared away?
Yes. Hey, from now on, let's do that at 8 minutes or 9 minutes; that's just cutting it too short.
I agree, that takes a long time.
Just too damn long. Throttle up after 15 seconds.
Son of a bitch, babe, I don't like the way this AGS is loading. It ain't loading right.
Okay. 2 minutes. I'm going to the final thing on my PGNS. 02:34. Let's pick up the checklist. Screw the AGS...
I don't like the way the AGS loaded, babe, at all.
Screw the AGS.
Okay.
Got to have my Master Arm, On.
Okay. 1 minute.
2 minutes.
Okay. Can't get it, babe. The AGS is no good.
[Garble] it's 01:53; let it go. Just make the PGNS burn. 01:45, let's go.
Okay. Stab/Control, DECA Power, Closed?
Yes.
Okay. And EPS Inverter Number 1, Closed?
Go.
Master Arm, On?
Got it.
Go to VOX. John can hear us. So he'll know we're burning. John, do you read us?
Roger. Loud and clear.
Tom, the AGS is No-Go on this one, babe.
The AGS is No-Go?
No, I'm talking to Tom.
Okay, at 35 seconds, Engine Arm to Descent.
Tom?
Go.
Tom, I can barely read you.
(Garble.) Is that better?
Just shout into the VOX. Blanks at 35 seconds.
Don't back this up with the start button.
Okay, I'll hit Proceed, and I'll start the clock.
Stand by to Proceed. Tape should be coming Off.
There's a 99!
We're burning, John.
Roger; I see you.
5, 6...
Stand by, babe.

Nice and smooth. 9 seconds, 8 seconds, 4, 3, 2,,,
Mark it.
Okay, let's see what we got. Okay, zero on the residuals.
Beautiful.
Okay, let me write that down. Minus 1 - minus point minus 0.1, minus 0.3, and minus 0.5. The burn's over, John.
Roger; good show. Okay, you guys want to do a - go to Simplex B, Data [garble] Simplex A (Voice/RNG) [garble]?
That's affirm. On your mark.
Okay.
Mark it.
[Garble].
Rendezvous Radar is Off.
Okay. T.P., got your Thrust, Off?
Off?
Engine Arm. Off?
[Garble] Off.
Engine Arm. OFF; Master Arm. Off?
Off.
Master Arm. Off? Got your Rendezvous Radar AC breaker Closed? Pitch down to where you're looking at a 180 - right about there. Tom, you ought to be having them. There's - there's - you're coming up on it right now.
Okay. I had you - At 3.81 miles (7.06 km), you were doing 73 feet a second (22.2 m/s).
Okay. Great, John.
Close that. There we go.
Okay.
You got all your radar breakers In. babe? Goddam Master Alarm.
Beautiful burn.
Sure looked pretty through the optics.
Are we in VOX?
Well. it's up to you whether you're on VOX or not. No, you're hot to John in this mode, in VHF Ranging.
Oh, yes.
John. what's your 4-minute mark? Do you have it?
Not yet.
Okay. at 4.82 miles (8.93 km). I have you at 70 feet per second (21.3 m/s).
Roger...
Okay, fine.
...we're reading 70 (fps (21.3 m/s)) here.
I [garble] you another [garble].
We never did call up Verb 82. We ought to call that up.
Yes. We got plenty of time now.
The DPS did good, didn't it. Just beautiful.
I hope so, babe, because we're going down.
Says what? The 60.5 by 6.8 (nm (97.4 x 10.9 km))? No that's - pardon me, that...
I guess you could pull that Landing Radar breaker, too, if you - if you can.
Pulled.
That Sun is wild.
You know what really gets me? The basic vehicles are just beautiful, these little things are just completely - get to you. Just like the [garble] breathing this stuff...
It looks now, you guys are slowed to 65 feet a second (19.8 m/s). Does that sound about right? It sounds right to me.
Yes, that sounds right, John.
Shit! Here we go.
Looks like a little bit of an overburn to me.
Shit! That'll take us a little lower.
Did you get - you got that Landing breaker, huh?
Yes.
Huh?
The DSKY finally read minus 0.1.
I - I recorded that.
Okay. Gene-o, give me the time to the phasing burn, and I'll Sync the clock.
Okay. Stand by a half.
Phasing burn time - You might want to write this - Here's the phasing dope - You can be looking - looking at that. I want to - oh, you reset that clock. Okay.
Okay. [Garble]. I'm sorry.
That's right.
Call it. Then get a Verb 82.
God damn that Master Alarm.
We've got over an hour to go to phasing.
How'd SHe pressure do?
Good.
Looks good.
SHe came down.
Beautiful.
Hello, Charlie Brown; this is Snoopy. Do you read?
Yes. Go ahead.
Man, we's getting down among them.
You got that clock counting now?
No, it's over an hour. The phasing burn is at 100:58:25.
I've got that updated right here. 100:58:25. You might want to start getting your clock set up. I'm going to see if there are some addresses I didn't leave out in this god-dang AGS up here.
Okay. We'll get all this stuff off here.
Okay, Tom. I've got to get out those books and find out when the hell...
Did you ever call Verb 82?
I called it. We're in 69 - Charlie Brown, we're in a 69.2 - a - 61.2 by 9.2 (113.3 by 17.0 km).
Roger.
How'd the DPS look to you?
