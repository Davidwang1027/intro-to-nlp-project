Okay. Do you want it to come back to you?
Snoopy, this is Houston. How do you read me?
So far it looks good.
Hey, Joe. We're about ready to dock. Stand by.
Very good.
Don't call us. We'll call you.
Roger that.
Okay, John. You're in to about 5 feet, babe. Looking beautiful.
How far?
feet.
Got a capture?
Yes. Thrusters are Off.
We got a capture, John. Fire when you're ready.
Everything looks good in here Tom.
Okay, babe? Ullage looks good.
Solid as a rock in the cabin, babe.
All right, babe. I can see you moving over. Hit it.
Oh, we got them. Right on the ball.
We got them, John. We heard them in there.
Hello, Houston. Snoopy and Charlie Brown are hugging each other.
Roger that. We heard them down here.
Okay. Let's stay - let's stay in our helmets, babe, until we get this thing squared away.
Okay, John. That was beautiful. Just beautiful, babe.
Okay. Now, John, let me ask you one thing. Do you want me to pressurize that LM tunnel through our hatch to save you from blowing that Mylar out again?
Okay. Do you want us to pressurize the tunnel?
Man, we is back home. Almost.
Okay.
Okay, I'll get started, and you can start helping him go through the hatch.
Houston, were you calling?
Negative, Gene. We're standing by until you got some time.
Okay, Joe. It's nominal that the rendezvous was the best one we've ever had. Right up the pike all the way. We'll talk about it later. I'm going start going through the tail end of the activation checklist for the APS burn and depletion, and Tom and John will start on the tunnel.
Roger that.
Snoopy, this is Houston. One thing we would like for you to do is go to secondary on the CO2 canister. We'd like to monitor that one while you're getting cleaned up there.
You're right, Jose. It's been a long day.
Say again, Joe.
Roger, Gene-o. We'd like for you to go to secondary on CO2 canister. We want to monitor that canister while you're getting cleaned up and back in the Command Module.
Yes.
Stand by, Joe. I can't - Wait a minute.
Okay. Now go ahead, Houston. Say again your last.
Roger. Go secondary on CO2 canister.
Okay. We're secondary on CO2 canister now.
Roger. Thank you.
Okay, John. How do you want to work the tunnel? Do you want to pressurize it or do you want me to? Okay. We got plenty of pressure. Okay. That's better. Okay. Go ahead. You pressurize it.
Hello, Houston, this is Snoopy. One thing, Charlie Brown is getting ready to pressurize the tunnel, and we want to make sure we're in the right attitude and everything for the next maneuver as far as the next thing that he needs to know are the angles. Over.
Okay. We'll get them for you, Snoopy.
Okay. Charlie Brown, Snoopy, this is Houston. Your CSM gimbal angles are: roll, 300; pitch, 021; and yaw, 000. We're standing by for your readback.
Okay. I got those for Charlie Brown. Roll, 300; pitch, 071; and yaw, 000.
Roger that.
Do you have an update on the LM weight?
Charlie Brown, this is Houston - No. Snoopy, this is Houston.
Go ahead. Do you have an update on the LM weight?
I've got that through, Gene-o, but we want you to load in your DAP 10010 for system A.
You want 10 - Say again what you want.
Okay. I want 10011. That'll be system A. That's in for your DAP; and, also, your LM weight for burn is 7 - 07544.
Roger. LM weight is 7544.
That's what I thought, I didn't enter that.
Hey, Joe, give me that once more and I'll get it straight.
Okay, Gene-o. Your LM weight is 7544 and in your DAP we want 10011. This is instead of 11011.
Very good. We copy, Gene-o.
Tom, is your stop button reset Auto for this? I am going to wait on a couple of these things while I verify that that tunnel is clear.
Snoopy, this is Houston.
Charlie Brown, Snoop. Let me know PAD.
Roger, Snoopy. Whenever you are ready, we can uplink your LM state vector to you.
Okay. We're reader right now. As soon as I get into P00 again. Got everything.
Okay. Thank you.
Hello, Charlie Brown, this is Snoopy. Let me know how the tunnel is coming.
Yes. We're holding it.
Let me get my gloves off, babe.
Good show, Tunnel all Tunnel all pressurized and everything looks good. Okay.
Okay.
put our bags? Do you remember? Bags asked for these?
Roger, John. We haven't moved at all. Okay. And Gene got the angles for that Auto maneuver.
Yes. Most all of it is.
Ours is the bag that I brought my helmet over in.
Snoopy, this is Houston. The computer is yours when you want it. Now we've got the load in.
Okay. Roger. Thank you.
And are you fellows in the transfer mode right now?
Just about.
Okay. I've got some PADs for you...
have not opened the hatch yet.
Okay. I've got some PADs for you, Gene, whenever you're ready to copy and give me a call when you're ready. Okay?
Okay, Joe. I'll call you when I'm ready.
Roger that. And you're aware of where your tool kit is. Is that affirmative?
Yes. Affirmative.
Okay. Do you have a LM Delta-P there?
Okay, Joe. We're going to open the hatch.
Roger, Tom.
Snoopy, this is Houston. We have three additional items that we want brought back. We want both the cameras brought back and would you believe, we also want the primary canister brought back, the lithium hydroxide canister brought back from the LM. Over.
Where do you plan for us to stow that, Houston?
Roger. We kind of anticipated that, and we're thinking about that right now. Make that the last item you transfer back, Tom.
All right.
Snoopy, this is Houston. We'd like to go to a forward Omni on the High Gain Antenna. We're just about against the stop now.
Roger. We are forward Omni.
Okay. Thank you a lot. Gene-o.
Hello, Houston. Go ahead and give me the update, would you please?
Roger that, Gene-o. Coming to you with APS depletion burn. Okay for Noun 33: 108:50:31.00; plus 45576, plus five balls, minus 06231; 46000, 4:07; three balls, 251. Plus 45981, minus five balls, plus 01339. And all else is NA. I'm standing by for your readback.
Okay, Joe. APS burn depletion is 108:50:31.00, plus 45576, plus all balls, minus 06231 46000 407. By the way, who's going to be in here to watch the burn time? Roll is all zero. Pitch is 251 986. Who is going load? Okay. Noun 86, plus 45981, and minus all balls, and plus 01339. And the COAS are NA.
Roger that. I've got one more change for you, Gene, in your checklist under activation 69, just prior to step 5, we want you to load in 404 plus all zeros.
I will do.
Charlie, does the DAP and everything look good to you right now? I won't go through that again.
Snoopy, this is Houston. Were you calling?
Yes. Does the DAP look good to you right now? I won't go through that again right at the moment. I'm starting over and running through this real quick.
Roger. That's good.
And Snoopy, this is Houston. On the LiOH canister, looks like under the left-hand couch in the sleeping bag is going to be the best place to stow that. And we really would like to have it come back. We got a rise in CO2 in the LM, and we'd like to take a look at that can.
Okay. I'll try and get it out. You don't want a new one in do you?
Negative that.
Snoopy, this is Charlie Brown. Over.
What do you want, John. I'm up to my earballs, here.
Hey, Gene-o, are you on the horn? Gene-o?
What, John?
Are you on the horn with?
I don't know, babe. I - Wait a minute.
Now who's calling? Houston, are you calling me?
Negative, Snoopy. We're just standing by.
Hey, boy! This is old Charlie Brown! Glad to be aboard! Where have you been? On leave?
Hey, John, are you in burn attitude?
burn attitude deadband? What do you think? Should we go to tight deadband?
Houston, Charlie Brown. Over.
Charlie Brown, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Should we be in tight deadband when we are in burn attitude? Over.
Stand by. I'll find out.
both my congratulations.
Charlie Brown, this is Houston. That's affirmative on tight deadband.
Say again, Joe?
That's affirmative for Charlie Brown. Tight deadband on your burn.
tight deadband do you have a requirement to lock on this thing or don't you?
Charlie Brown, this is Houston. I'm sorry, John, you're cutting out pretty bad. If you could understand we will want you on tight deadband and if there's anything else, would you relay it through Snoopy?
Roger.
Hey, Joe, I'm down to the point where I've configured the S-band, so if I've missed anything - you got high bit rate - let me know. The only thing I haven't done is turn the voice off to you.
Okay, Snoopy. One thing that we'll want now is the settings on your control knob there for your High Gain for pitch and yaw.
Okay. I'm looking at about 182 and minus oh.
Houston, Charlie Brown, now how do you read?
Charlie Brown, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. While we're waiting for this thing to separate from us, should we be in tight deadband or is 5 degrees okay?
Negative, Charlie Brown. We want narrow deadband and we want you to configure your DAP as per your checklist. Over.
Roger.
And, Snoopy, this s Houston. We copied 182, what was the yaw setting on that control knob?
Yaw setting is minus 5 and I'm going through the DSKY slow, so if you see something, tell me.
Okay. We'll monitor. Thank you.
You mean the checklist in the Flight Plan there, Joe?
That's affirmative.
Man, with those numbers in there, I'm not so - I'm glad I'm getting out.
(Laughter) Roger.
And just for the record, Joe, you're a fink.
Copy, fink.
Okay, Joe. The checklist I got shows for the active docking, you have 61112.
That's affirmative, John.
Wide deadband?
Okay. Stand by. I'll check that out, John.
And this morning they told me that AC roll - didn't want to use it, and this afternoon. Okay.
This thing calls me to set your timer, John, but we're well over an hour away, so forget about it.
Houston, on step 4 on activation 69 where I proceed, do I have to do anything with that four balls 2?
That's a negative, Snoopy.
Okay. Now what'd you want me to put there for the LM weight, there, Joe?
Okay. I'm getting that, Charlie Brown.
Okay, Charlie Brown. This is Houston.
I just want to express a heartfelt thanks.
Charlie Brown, this is Houston. For your LM weight we want to set in 07544; and, John, we're satisfied with your 61112 setup.
Okay. LM will stay the same because we're going to get rid of that thing,
That's affirmative.
Joe, 267 out of the AGS reads 4600.
Roger. Copy 4600. That looks good, and Snoopy, it looks like you're going to have to slew from Max signal again, and we'll need those knobs - control knobs settings after you do it.
All right.
Houston, this is Charlie Brown.
Go ahead, Charlie Brown. Houston.
Roger. I just wanted to say I sure do thank everybody that worked on that probe and made it work the way it did.
Roger. We copy that, John.
Sure is a - sure worked good.
That's what we like to hear.
Can't tell you how pleased I am.
Now will you autograph a picture for me?
Of the probe, yes.
No - you're a fink, I told you.
The fink sure is sending a man out to do a boy's job, though.
Roger that.
Hey, Joe. There's slew for a Max signal. I brought it up a little bit but all I did was move the numbers and they're reading the same thing: 182 and minus 5.
Okay. We copy, Gene-o. 182 and minus 5. And, as you're coming through the tunnel you might take a look at the docking angle there and see how close it is.
Make that 182 and minus 10.
Roger. 182 and minus 10.
Charlie Brown, Houston.
Go ahead. Over.
Roger, John. We got our tail between our legs, here. We'll need for you to load in your DAP 61102, and you get an "atta boy" for that.
Alrighty.
And Snoopy, once he gets that set up, in the narrow deadband, I'm afraid we're going to have to ask you to slew for Max signal again.
Snoopy, Houston.
Go ahead. Over.
Roger, Snoopy. When we were...
should be the other compartment.
Monitoring your activation 69, the last two steps. We'd like for you to verify that you've put 616 to zeros and 411 to plus 1.
Snoopy, this is Houston. What we copied down here on the last step was 611 instead of 411.
Yes. I put 411, I'll check it for you.
Okay. Thank you Gene-o.
There you go.
Okay?
Okay, Snoopy. We got it. Thank you very much, and we'll need no ascent feed on this, Snoop.
Okey doke. I only forgot the PCM switch High one time when I went to update, how's that?
That's better than the average bear.
Snoopy, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Okay, Gene-o. Referring back to activation 64 on step 2, we'd like pressure Regs A and B to Egress, please.
Thank you sir. That one happened in a big fast rush.
You bet you. Copy that. Thank you very much Gene-o.
And Charlie Brown, this is Houston. I've got a maneuver PAD for you, John, when youre ready to copy.
Have a what, sir?
I have a maneuver PAD, TEI-22.
Roger. Wait one.
Roger. Let me know when youre ready.
What's your LOS time, Joe?
Say again, please.
Joe, that's about as high as I can tweak those things and it's 182 and minus 5. (High Gain Antenna angles)
Okay. I copy, 182 and minus 5 and our LOS time is 107:31. We've got about 13 minutes, yet.
Okay. Now you're going to give me the TEI PAD, huh?
If you're ready to copy, John.
Go to it. Over.
Roger that. SPS, G&N coming up. Okay you're Noun 47: 37100, minus 060, plus 079, 119;41;28.85; plus 29472, plus 00558, minus 00165; NA; 071; all else is NA. And stand by for the readback, Charlie.
Okay. What is the 071, the pitch angle? Right?
Thats pitch angle, and before you read it back, Snoopy, I'd like for you to double-check on this activation 69: 616 to all balls and 411 to plus 1. Those are the last two steps.
Say again?
Okay, Snoopy. This is Houston. Do you copy?
Yes. I copy, but I didn't hear what you said.
Okay. We need for you to go 616 to all zeros. This is still activation 69. This is the last 2 steps: 616 to all zeros and 411 to plus 1.
Babe, I just read it out and it is all zeros.
Okay. Thank you much.
I'll do it again.
Okay. We'll appreciate it if you'll give it one more try.
That's what I'm doing.
I'm reading in address 500 158.2, it bounces around 142.2, 134.3...
Okay. Those sound good Snoopy.
And Snoopy/Charlie Brown, this is Houston. We've got about 10 more minutes until LOS and Charlie Brown, when you're ready to read back, I'm standing by for your readback on that maneuver PAD.
Roger. SPS, G&N; 37100; minus 060, plus 079; 119:41;28.85; plus 29472, plus two balls 558, two balls 165; pitch 071.
Readback is correct, John.
Hello, Snoopy. This is Houston.
Hello, Snoopy, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Snoopy. We keep losing signal on this High Gain Antenna. What I'd like for you to do, Gene-o, just before you leave the LM, I'd like for you to slew a Max signal again and give us those settings one more time. We keep dropping a signal out and rather than going back and trying to slew it, just before you get ready to leave, slew it up again for Max signal, if you would.
When are you going to have the debriefing in this one, Joe?
Glynn said in a couple of days.
How soon can you shower and be ready?
That's the first nominal run - That's the first nominal run we ever had.
You should see those Meds they have up here.
Hey, Houston. Have you been watching this package A temperature? We never have got it to go down much all day.
We'll be with you on that. Just a minute there, Charlie Brown.
Okay. I guess we've gone this long. We can go another week or so.
Snoopy wants to know if he should go into P42. Over.
Say again Charlie Brown. I missed part of that.
Snoopy would like to know if he should go into P42. Over.
Okay. Stand by. I'll find out.
Charlie Brown, this is Houston.
Houston, do you read Snoopy?
Negative, Snoopy. Leave it in P00.
Okay, just let me verify my guidance control switches for you. Okay?
Roger. Go.
Okay. Guidance control is PNGS. AGS S-band is Max. Attitude control is Mode Control on roll, pitch, and yaw and mode control switches both PNGS and AGS are in Auto. Is that correct?
That's correct, Snoopy. You got them all right.
And you wanted the DSKY left in P00.
That's affirmative. Leave her in P00.
And the updata link switch is On.
Okay. We copy. And did you copy? We want you to slew that S-band for Max signal one more time and give us a reading just before you leave.
Okay. I've got one more thing to stow here and then I'll do it. How much time have I got here yet?
Okay, We've got about 2 minutes and 30 seconds until LOS.
Let me do it now, and I'll take the canister on my way out. Let me slew this thing.
That sounds great, Gene-o.
Hey, Joe, would you believe I've got all the circuit breakers pulled? And I can't tell, I don't know where MAX signal strength is anymore. Let me see.
Okay. That's good right there, Gene-O, the way you've got it.
Snoopy, Houston TELCOMM says you got her right there. That's a good shot in the blind.
Okay. Same numbers I gave you before. I'm going off the air.
Roger that. See you back in Charlie Brown. Good show, Gene-o.
