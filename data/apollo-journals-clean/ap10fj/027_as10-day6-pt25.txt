Got about 8 minutes [garble] realign the GDC to the IMU [garble] start the vertical strip - 120 seconds. Yes.
Yes. Terminator is f:4 at 1/125th - 1/125th, babe. To get them mothers, you get more light, you lift it up to - 250. Okay?
I've got a Verb 83, here comes the Sun.
You started at 19:41:31.
And 1/125th at f:4.
How could Apollo 8 [garble]?
Enough to take a picture of it. They were here 20 hours.
76 [garble].
[Garble] sunlight. Where did I put the cotton-picking [garble]? What could I have done with the dang thing? That's stupid.
Okay. Gene-o.
What...
John, can I keep Verb 82 up here?
Yes. Let's try Verb 82, Tom.
Okay. I'll get it.
What time [garble].
19:41:31.
That's right. That's exactly What...
Hell, yes. [Garble].
No matter what.
That's right [garble] maneuver. [Garble].
Did you guys - You didn't notice any torquing angles or anything, did you?
No, [garble] every little thruster go boom, boom, ba-boom, boom.
Noisy. That thing [garble] bang, bang, bang.
I know it. He never did. That cotton-picking Pete Conrad's got the right idea. He and Dick Gordon. On [Gemini] XI - they [garble]. That's no way to do that [garble] or any - You know, people are just that way. They're going to screw you, no matter what, you know? You know, you can have the [garble] in the world and [garble]. They're going to fix it so [garble].
... you didn't use the "..." word. We're recording. (Laughter)
Right. I bet you if we go to 6-month [garble], that's exactly what'd happen. People sit around and they won't do a damn thing for 4 months, and in 2 months [garble]...
Okay. Gene-o. Standing by in about 1 minute [garble] f:4 at [garble] terminator here [garble] and José...
Yes, [garble].
[Garble] 150 west.
Okay, [garble] 150 west.
19:32.
Okay, [garble].
40 - 19:32:44.
Okay, Tom. I'm ready to go.
Hold on. [Garble] seconds. Be sure you're at 1/125th.
1/125th [garble].
Are you going to take any color at all?
[Garble].
You got color on there?
Yes. Yes. Color; Okay, at the terminator - 2.8 at 1/250. Ready?
42 something.
41:31.
When is yours supposed to start?
At 40 - 42:46.
Did you get that [garble]?
Yes. Okay, that is [garble] is brownish gray.
You know. Tom; the next time we do the vertical [garble]...
I tell you, the thing changes color depending on the Sun's - Sun - probably Sun elevation. 42:46, got about 30 seconds to go.
Coming up on the [garble].
Okay. I [garble].
1. 2, go. I can't get over how round this thing is. It isn't very big, but it's round.
[Garble].
[Garble].
Can you get it from this pass? Okay, now later on, I want to start - When it starts to get bright out here just a little bit what you want to do. Gene-o. is [garble] and we will open - a little bit well, we'll open the thing up.
You want me to 250 [shutter speed] [garble]?
Yes, but - I think - Let's see if it gets bright or not.
You got a time [garble]?
No. [Garble].
Okay. XV.
Coming up?
Yes.
Oh, way up there?
No, right underneath it.
Is that XV there?
Yes.
What time we have?
11 minutes. Okay. Gene-o. It's starting to get pretty light. I'll say we should be 25 - f:4 at 250[th] on the black and white. Okay? Got it?
f:4 at 1/250th and open the sequence camera up to what I'd estimate as 5.6. 560 on the - 5.6.
If we had another Hasselblad, we could be taking right out that window [garble].
Okay, for the rest of the pass, until we get over near the other terminator, [garble] zero phase [garble] we go to f:5.6 on the black and white.
[Garble]. Why don't I think?
225 right there. There's CP-1.
You got it? [Garble] Yes. Look [garble] crater with that big peak in it? Yes.
[Garble] this is 303.
Where. John?
Right here, right here.
Where?
Right there.
Okay. That's 303?
Yes.
Where's the 310?
310 [garble].
[Garble] got a big...
[Garble] on the right, over there at 301.
I got that...
Tom, what time?
Okay, it's 47:48 [garble].
[Garble] right and on the left [garble].
It's getting so much Sun out now. I'd go ahead and open that...
Okay, what' s the [garble]?
It's 16:23.
Oh, yes, the best view I've ever seen.
Good show, John. [Garble].
We're looking at crater 299 - and - on the left, I don't know what that other one is but there's two - two right beside it. This terrain doesn't really look nearly as foreboding as these Orbiter photographs. At least [garble].
[Garble] lots more holes on this side, but it's not as rugged as the hill country on the other side.
See that star coming up over there?
[Garble]. That big one is 297. Why don't you take a picture of 297? Look at that little crater right beside it. That [garble] crater right there. Isn't that beautiful?
Which one [garble]?
That one right next to that crater the edge of that.
Over on the left here?
Yes. on 297.
Okay, you see that white one on the left there, John?
Yes. That's the one I'm talking about.
[Garble].
Right there?
That white one and see the black on the inside and white...
Yes.
...[garble].
I don't know. I would say it's probably a volcano.
I'd say that's a volcano - definitely.
But I don't - Hell, you know, I ain't qualified to say. I just [garble].
Yes. There's IX coming up - that huge basin.
Keep it pretty close to the vertical, Tom. [Garble].
Yes. I - I'm keeping it right on. That's where I've got Verb 82. See, your [garble]. That's why I've got Verb 82. Man, that's a weird-looking crater.
[Garble].
No. That part of the country out there looks pretty rugged - out there north of Florida.
You know, it's kind of fun just to sit around and do this after [garble] rendezvous...
This is a piece of cake. [Garble] landmark tracking is going to be easy, too, if I don't load the wrong numbers.
If we just continue this and I'd say go to f:8 now on that color film, babe.
I'm already there.
f:8 and 1/250th?
Look at those funny hump - humpbacks that they were talking about the other day [garble].
Turtleback?
Yes. Those turtlebacks right over there. See those [garble] with humps out instead of going down.
Oh; yes, [garble].
This looks like Tallahatchie Ridge, right here. See this ridge - coming around like that.
Oh, yes.
[Garble] great big [garble] crater [garble].
Yes. You see - you see on your Tallahatchie Ridge kind of an old crater - big deep one dug out in there?
Yes.
You know, from here you can see boulders in that one.
Oh, yes, [garble].
Oh, it looks like a precipice. It looks like [garble] is giving away up there near the edge. Let me see those monoculars.
Okay, the top - there you go. You can really see how this stuff starts to fall into place. On that last right there, you can see the [garble] down at the bottom. You can see how the stratification up there is kind of a wavy stratification. In fact, the stratification goes with the hump on out from it.
Yes.
[Garble] the way it leads the hard stuff.
[Garble] boulders down there now?
Hey, is that moving!
What?
That there, looks like a boulder's about to run downhill; no, I guess it isn't. Look at that stuff that hangs out - the real hard material and all that soft stuff tails away and then you can see how they roll down and got stopped at the bottom; then there's a big pile of them down near the tailings at the bottom. But the soft stuff sloughs away first, then comes the hard, and that's definitely an impact crater [garble].
Oh, look at that boulder. I bet that boulder from 60 miles [96km] looks big enough to - that boulder's at least 80 to 100 feet [24 to 30 meters] across - 80 - oh, maybe a hell of a let more than that. It - also, it looks like how the old one [garble] you notice how it looks like ridges?
Yes.
That's the whole thing slumps down [garble] I hope Jack's listening to the tape that we're recording.
Now here's one.
You can see how the slopes get shallower as they get older. It's very obvious to see that. And look - Oh, here's some more boulders just hanging up there ready to go, falloff in there. Say, when it falls it looks like the new stuff that falls is white and the older stuff that gets aged is brown. It's white and it becomes a tan after it falls away, and it falls away in levels. You can see kind of - like the old stuff breaks away in levels.
Man, there's all kinds of - Look at all that dark - how dark. Look at this crater up here, that's got the dark stuff on the wall.
Which one, José? [Garble] I see it...
That's where - that's where instead of - the material instead of [garble].
Yes. Right - right up near the edge there, there's a rille that is dark black. We saw that [garble] I'd say the edge of that crater is a good 2,000 feet [600 meters] in height - 3,000 [900 meters], maybe. This monocular helps you.
And, baby, that's impact - Look at the way it's round-shaped. That's a hell of an impact and you can see where it's throwing the ejecta, that black stuff. up on the outside rim; and, on the inside, you can see where the black stuff has fallen down and laid at the bottom. It's all spotted down at the bottom. See it?
Yes.
See if you can see it, and how it's ledged halfway down on the crater. Okay. Let me get back here on my tracking now.
That's [garble] IP there. CP-1...
Yes...
And also down at the bottom...
...[garble] CP-2 [garble] from two sides. They've got one coming in from the north and one coming in from right there.
Okay.
CP-2 is...
Oh, and also you see - look and see how much has fallen away and how in outer slopes is a slight or lower slope, but it's kind of sloughing off, tending to override the black material there.
Yes.
See that? There's a little higher ridge [garble].
That's black stuff.
You better believe it...
[Garble].
Okay - now, out here you can see a whole bunch of chains of craters; volcanisms [garble]...
That stuff is flat black. It's blacker than hell.
The stuff that falls off the new areas is just as white, whitish tan [garble] as the sand. Now, you can - God, look at those boulders in there. I'd hate to go - try to sledge hammer that son of a bitch. Down at the bottom, it looks like just layer after layer has sloughed off and the crater is getting - the walls are getting less steep.
[Garble] rilles on the back side...
No, there's very few rilles on the back side as compared to the maria.
...[garble].
Okay, you guys; we're coming up on my old favorite crater here: CP-2.
You got that bear?
Yes. and I don't see anything good to track on it...
Okay, our subsolar point is 20:10:58 and I have to roll 180 and pitch down 24.
[Garble]...
Yes, [garble] get near it, Gene-o, [garble].
What?
Zero [garble] 5.6 at 1/250th on the black and white, but that's still 12 minutes away.
Does it look smoky out there to you guys?
Where?
Out there. [Garble] my eye. [Garble] the sunlight, I guess.
Look at - hey, look at [garble]. Look at all the black [garble] all the black and white [garble] all over the place.
I want to track that little bitty crater and I want to get down right in it [garble].
Tom, [garble] the monocular.
There's a new little - a new little impactor over there.
Looks like a dimple crater to me. Looks like it gets deeper and deeper and deeper.
I'll tell you, 211 is about [garble].
It's got white walls.
[Garble]. It must be hotter than blue blazes down there. Look at that real bright. Looks like it's brand new.
Brand new, real bright, That's why it damn near looks pink, doesn't it? It surely looks pink [garble].
Look over here at 211.
Oh, look at that one, beautiful!
[Garble].
Yes, for crying out loud. [Garble] anybody can't say that's - that's just with no color. There's all kinds of colors in there.
There's colors in that. You'd better believe it. There's a basic light tone all over the outside; the rim is brown. Hell, I can see a big black boulder down in there with my naked eye from here. You can see where [garble]...
[Garble].
...has fallen down. It looks like the stuff just leaks out, and I [garble] going through the same process as time goes on [garble] parts of the wall are starting to go down. You can see the tailings there, but as they go down, they leave these whitish areas. You can see the rays from them. That son of a bitch splattered all over the countryside. You can track rays, gee, for miles there. Okay, we got 10 more minutes, Gene.
[Garble].
Okay, if you hold it just a little below Orb Rate, then John can do his tracking [garble].
Absolutely. [garble] boulders on the side of this [garble].
Now here's this place that I thought was a straight line. Let's - [garble] straight.
The craters, Gene?
Yes.
Oh, look at - look at - you can see...
Man, there must have been some spouting way down below [garble] it's a - Got it. Okay, there's a whole string or them. It goes along one way...
It's really a crater.
[Garble].
Boy, this is sure a crummy map.
Here again, near the rim it's lined with black stuff [garble] starting to roll down, tailings down below. Wouldn't that be the gas if we could see a volcano go off while we're here [garble] so low? Like [garble] going to get in it [garble] nobody's going to see the volcano in orbit [garble].
[Garble] worth looking for.
What's our time at the subsolar point, John?
That solar point is 120:10:58, and that's when I roll, and later on I'm going to yaw to the north so we - you do stereo for 1 then I yaw left back to get stereo 2.
Isn't that crazy? Look at that - look at that down there. Is that smoke in that crater there?
No, [garble]...
You mean that brown stuff...
...brown...
With the white around it. Brown - white...
Where - where did it come from? Where did it come from?
Brown discoloration [garble].
[Garble].
It still had to come from someplace. Yet you don't see any - Oh, maybe it got pitched up out of - Did it get pitched up out of that crater next to it?
Could be.
What time is it [garble]?
120:03.
No, I mean [garble].
30 minutes, John; 31 minutes.
Is it supposed to be turned around or something?
Yes. Which way you want [garble] which way do you want me to turn, Gene, to keep the sun out of your window? Any particular way?
[Garble].
Yes, I'd go ahead - 5 minutes to the subsolar point, I'd go ahead and crank it down to 5.6 on the - 5.6 on the black and white and f:11 on the color [garble].
What time [garble]?
32 minutes, John.
Boy!
And there's a boulder field, right down by [garble] right down [garble] impact one.
Yes.
And right next to it is - one, two - just kind of laying there by themselves. Wonder how they dropped into that one? That's a big - he's a big fellow. Got boulders up to 300 and 400 feet [90 and 120 meters] [garble] pile of them [garble].
I can't see them with my naked eye, but I can sure see them with [garble].
[Garble] something wrong if you can't.
Okay, 5 minutes to the roll maneuver.
I'll roll left - [garble] tannish gray...
What time is it now, Tom?
It's about 4 - 32:44 and [garble] - we got 4 - about 4 minutes until we roll.
Boy, I can't - are you [garble]?
[Garble] 250 at 5.6 and it's f:11 on the sequence camera.
[Garble] on the left.
Which one? Oh...
[Garble].
I'm not so sure those are...
...that's a volcanic. That's a volcanism, the way it peaks up there, and keeps building up, and...
I just can't believe that.
It's got to be a volcano, babe; [garble].
Boy, I tell you. See that real bright one way up yonder, see...
Yes.
...[garble].
Monocular. Yes, that monocular is great [garble] you can see all kinds of features.
What they ought to do is give you real usable telescope, so you...
Hey, look at - look at the Earth. See that Earth.
Oh, God.
Isn't that beautiful?
That's just fantastic.
Would you believe Africa?
Oh, that is unbelievable...
That's why...
Oh. outstanding. Beautiful.
You've never seen that before, have you, John? You just got to see it [garble] Isn't that a beautiful Earth?
Ahhhhhh! Talking about the dawn coming up like thunder. Man. that's [garble] Look at that.
That's the whole Earth. That's - [laughter]...
That's unbeliev - that's unreal.
That's why I want to get this color - Gene-o, that's why we want to get this color stuff [garble] John does the landmark tracking [garble].
This works damn good for keeping count of where you are.
Okay. I'm going to have to roll at 10:58. That's beautiful. What a contrast, tan and - Now we're getting over, Gene-o; [garble]. This thing goes from a little tan to a dark - a dark - it's a brownish tan. It's a black [garble].
Apollo 10, Houston is standing by.
Now here it doesn't look as bright in the Smyth's Sea as it did back there.
Yes, and also, [garble] black [garble]. No, we're 36 [garble] on John's map. 120:09. I've got to roll. Here we go, babe. I got to roll. Okay.
Okay, now what do I do here with this camera?
Okay. I'd stop it right there. [Garble] roll and pitch 258.
Oh. this is just great. This is just fantastic.
[Garble].
Yes. Now that one has white in the middle [garble] that was definitely impact; there's no doubt. the way it describes a rim, sort of.
That raised stuff - it looks like it's painted with a paintbrush...
Yes, but you see that little bitty basket up there, John? Now, that's definitely a volcanism, you know; not much ray and kind of rounded.
It is rounded on top. There's one way back there...
Yes, but the one way up there...
That peak is...
That - that's the volcano right there - that little one over there, but this big white one down here is...
...that peak is 3-0-whatever-it-is. One of the first craters when it comes off the horizon. You'll see it next time [garble] CP-1.
It looks like [garble] to me.
I need to pitch 258.
Like that one right underneath it.
Yes. Yes.
That looks like it's a volcano.
That's the volcano - it seems rounded and it doesn't [garble].
Can't prove it by me [garble].
Boy, I tell you, I couldn't [garble].
Well, you do. You have to look, John.
Well, it does - it has a central dark...
[Garble].
I know. but look how it's bowed [garble] like that.
Okay. I'm pitching to 258.
Okay, there's [garble].
258 coming up.
God. This is bad. Let me know when we get ...
Okay. That seems to get it.
What's the time now?
We're still looking subsolar. No, we're going away from it. No, no. We're looking at - look out there's the subsolar point, right here.
There's CP-1 [garble] target [garble]; you know, man. anybody who says these things are all flat is touched.
[Garble] subsolar point [garble].
What's the time?
The time is 20:14 - 120...
Yes. That looks like [garble].
41:30.
41:30 [garble], Tom.
Yes. Right there.
This is the worst map I ever saw in my life.
Now we're starting to get a few little rilles down here. And I'm down to zero phase - my reticle is washed out. I can't even see my reticle...
My reticle is washed out [garble].
Yes. Mine is washed out.
I didn't - I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to [garble].
[Garble]. Yes. I did. I did.
Man, it's there - ain't no doubt about it. That cotton-picking Moon ain't [garble].
God!
[Garble] straight around it, it's a hell of a lot higher. Think maybe Smyth's Sea was one big impact and then the volcano [garble].
[Garble].
Okay. Minus 71 and 170.
It's beautiful [garble].
(Singing)
Got minus 70 and [garble].
Plus?
Minus.
Apollo 10, Houston. Standing by.
Roger, Houston. We're taking our vertical stereo photography now. We just rolled past the subsolar point there.
Roger, 10. we copy. [Long pause.]
Hey, Jack. Now that we've got some time to pick out - really concentrate on this stuff, we're finding all kinds of features in here. And it's mostly been on the tape, but I hope you'll be able to get the tape and play it there.
Roger. While we're talking about the tape, we've been getting on the playback come weak voice and background noise, and we found out on a prior flight that this comes out a lot better if you make sure you have the mike real close to your mouth when you talk into the tape recorder. Over.
That is affirmative. All of you who were talking to the tape recorder.
We're now yawing left, 20 degrees.
Roger, 10.
Houston, Apollo 10. We've just passed over Mount Marilyn and the crater Weatherford. Over.
Roger. We copy.
Yawing right 20 degrees to pick up Landing Site 2, now.
Roger, 10. [Long pause.]
And we're right on top of Maskelyne at this time.
Roger, 10. [Long pause.]
Over Maskelyne B now.
Apollo 10, Houston. Say again, please.
Roger. We're just past Maskelyne B, and I'm right - looking straight down at Sidewinder Rille, coming up to the head of Diamondback Rille.
Roger. We're following you. [Pause.]
Sabine E is on the left. On my left as we go backwards. [Pause.]
There's Faye Ridge.
Roger, 10. We observe you're liable to get sunlight on the windows here pretty soon.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Picking up U.S. 1 on the right.
Roger. [Long pause.]
We've got Moltke out my right window. We're right over Landing Site 2.
Roger. Copy. [Long pause.]
And there's landmark 130.
Roger. Landmarker. [Long pause.]
And Langrenus is quite a majestic crater with a tremendously beautiful central peak. One that we were just able to look at sunset the other day that's just beautiful today.
Roger, Gene-o. Langrenus. And you'll have to speak up a little louder, please.
And I see crater 133 with that little crater we talked about on the right of it for tracking.
Roger. [Long pause.]
We have a beautiful panorama looking back from Sabine and Ritter over the landing site back to Maskelyne A and B and then over past Mount Marilyn there.
Roger, Tom. [Long pause.]
I'll tell you, later on today - We'll talk about it when we have a chance for a rev, we may just go to a vertical strip, roll 90 degrees so you can get High Gain, and we'll shoot the tube on it, because I know it will pick it up and you can pick out all these features. Over.
Roger, Tom. We'll start thinking about that. [Long pause.]
Also, you might tell Jack that we couldn't have a better crater named after him, because we are looking at him now back from Sabine and Ritter, and the boulders that have been kicked out of it on the outside slope nearly look like a forest of pine trees, there's so many big black boulders there.
Say again the name of that, Tom.
It's really spotted the countryside with them. That's what we code named it Herr Schmidt.
Roger. He says thanks, but it's - spelled the name wrong.
Well, we were in a hurry anyway. We didn't have too much time to worry about details. It looks just like a scattered - about the same density, you know, as pine trees up on a mountain ridge. That's about what these big black boulders look like.
Roger. [Long pause.]
We're now in an area that is really noticeably marked by volcanic activities. We have all types of lumps - of lumps here and we can really see there's just thousands of volcanoes here, just a tremendous volcanic field at this time. Over.
Roger.
Lots of volcanic mounds.
Roger. That makes the geologists happy. [Long pause.]
I've got one interesting site here. Looks like a - It's probably too dark to take a picture. but you can see where you've had a big impact crater with the ramped edge. It looks like a stream of volcanic material has run over into it.
Roger. Tom. If you went to 1/125 on the Hasselblad. you might get it.
Yes. We've got 1/125 now. It's getting awful dark here. We've got a lot of Sun on the windows. It's pretty bad.
We shot the whole strip. Sure hope we got you some good data. We got it in the sequence camera at one frame per second, color all the way through, and we got the Hasselblad all the way, too. Over.
That's great. [Long pause.]
Apollo 10. Houston. If you're going to fly the next vertical strip photography, namely in Rev-31, in that same attitude, why, then we can give you the TV. Over.
Okay. Did you have High Gain lock on us that time? Say again.
That's affirmative. We had it most of the way, and if we can confirm that you will fly in the same attitude in Rev-31, why, TV will come through all right.
Yes. We will fly the same one as the last. You get a tremendous panoramic view looking back over Landing Site 1, Over. [Garble] as you come over Landing Site 2, looking back over the maria area. It's just fantastic. We'll try to show it to you.
Roger. We'll plan on it for Rev-31, then.
Alrighty.
And the Sun went down and we have the solar corona.
Roger, 10. [Pause.]
And when you get things put away up there, we've got three PADs and a state vector update for you and a couple more discussion type questions.
Okay. If you want to state vector update, we're in P00, and we can toss you the computer.
Okay, 10. We're ready for the update when you're ready.
Roger, go.
CMC and Accept.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 10, Houston. We're ready with the state vector update when you're ready to Accept.
We're P00 and Accept.
Roger. P00 and Accept. [Long pause.]
Apollo 10, Houston. Our signal strength is going down. Could we get Omni Charlie for this, please?
Okay. I'm going to roll 180 degrees in just a minute.
Roger. We'll wait. [Pause.]
Houston, can we get the map update?
Okay. Apollo 10. I've got a map data - map update for you. Rev-24: LOS, 121:19:59; 121:31:11; 122:06:09; sunrise is 121:33:30; sunset, 122:45:55. Read back, and I've got the landmark tracking update PAD after that.
Roger. 121:19:59, 121:31:11, 122:06:09, 121:33:30, 122:45:55, Rev-24.
That's affirmative. You ready for your tracking update?
Go. Over.
Okay. Charlie Papa 1: 121:39:49, 121:42:49, 3 balls, 050, 3 balls, north 13 miles, 11, 40. Charlie Papa 2: 121:55:10, 121:56:52, 3 balls, 2 balls 8, 3 balls, north 05, 04, 40. Fox 1: 122:07:55, 122:10:06, 3 balls, 326, all balls, north 10, 09, 41. Number 130: 122:29:03, 122:30:37, 3 balls, 265, 3 balls, north at 13, 12, 40. Go ahead. And I've got a maneuver PAD after that.
Roger. Charlie Papa 1: 121:39:49, 121:42:49, all balls, north 13, 11 and 40. Charlie Papa 2: I missed T1. Over.
Roger. On Charlie Papa 2, we had 121:55 and 10. And we want to confirm the nautical miles on Charlie Papa 1 as being 13 - 13. Over.
Roger. 13 north. Okay. Charlie Papa 2: 121:55:10, 121:56:52, all balls, 008, all balls, north 05, 04, 40. F-1: 122:07:55, 122:10:06, all balls, 326, all balls, north 10, 09, 41. 130: 122:09:03, 122:30:37, 000, 265, all balls, north 13, 12, and 40.
Roger. You got it, and we're ready with the maneuver PAD.
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. This is TEI-24: SPS/G&N; 36818; minus 061, plus 076; 123:40:52.33: plus 30443, plus 00131, plus 00682; NA, 066, and the rest is NA. Under ullage, two jets for l4 seconds. Over.
Jack, we had an antenna switch right in the middle of that. You'd better start it over.
Apollo 10, Houston. Before we proceed, lets lock up with the High Gain. Over.
Okay. We're still maneuvering, Stand by one.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Hello, Houston. This is 10. We're in Accept and P00 and ready for your update and ready for your PAD.
Roger, 10. Reading you loud and clear now. The uplink's coming up and here's the PAD. TEI-24: SPS/G&N; 36818; minus 061, plus 076; 123:40:52.33; 0 - correction - plus 30443, plus 00131, plus 00682; roll is NA, pitch is 066. The rest is NA. Your ullage is two jets for 14 seconds. Over.
Okay, Jack. I got TEI-24: SPS/G&N; 36818; minus 061, plus 076; 123:40:52.33; plus 30443, plus 00131, plus 00682; NA, and pitch is 066. The rest is NA; two jets for 14 seconds.
That affirmative.
Apollo 10, Houston. The uplink is complete. Computer is yours; you can go to Block. And we've noted that on the last pass during the strip photography, you were rolled 180 degrees different than that we expected you to be. And we'd like to ask you a couple of questions about the LM S-band yesterday and LM pressurization when you have an opportunity to discuss it. Over.
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. On the S-band communications around the DOI period - Do you have anything significant to report having lost comm for about 20 minutes on the High Gain there? We were a little concerned as to what the problem might be. Can you discuss that?
No. I noticed we were having, locked - out lockout problems as we went low across the landing site. It appeared that it occurred right at our low time, and the S-band didn't track - didn't follow us when we came across the landing site, and I went to Omnis hoping without having too much time to play with it. And, then, a period of time after that, I played with the S-band again and was able to acquire you and lock on. That's all I can really say, but it did occur somewhere near the low part of our trajectory.
Roger. We understand another question is regarding the LM pressurization. We noted that right after you pickled old Snoopy off Charlie there, that the LM cabin pressurization went down. Do you - did you observe anything or note anything unusual about that. Over.
Jack, he moved away with a blast, and the next thing we had in our eyes was sunlight right through the windows and we couldn't see a thing. I do know that both dump valves were in Auto, however. We had a lot of garbage around after the blast from the pyros, but other than that - Tom may have seen something else.
Well, I was looking out the center hatch window and, as you know, the tunnel - We couldn't get the tunnel depressurized, and when we fired those pyros, some more insulation blew out, and I just saw Snoopy disappear in a big snowstorm going straight up into the Sun and that was all. Over.
Roger. Thank you. And last time we saw Snoopy down here, he was 37,000 miles [68,500 km] going straight up from the Moon at 5,400 feet per second [1,645 m/s], and thank you for your comments. Over.
Okay. And the - look - Okay. I guess I got run ahead. We made some changes in here on that roll.
Roger. We noticed.
And the way that the times have changed. But it didn't - I'm sorry about that - but it didn't seem to - We didn't get any shafting or anything on our windows at all until right at the last when we hit the terminator.
Roger. That was the only thing we were concerned about.
Yes. I don't think it'll - No, I just don't.
There was no shafting at all on the windows and it looked like - We were giving our comments and I don't think we had any problem at all.
Roger. Thank you for your comments. They're good. And understand we will have this attitude for Rev-31.
Apollo 10, Houston. We'd like you to check the situation with fuel cell 1; ensure that your fuel cell pump's AC circuit breaker on panel 226 is Closed. And that your fuel cell number 1 AC 1 is Closed - correction - is AC1. You copy, 10?
Okay. We just [garble].
Hello, Jack.
Apollo 10. Houston. Do you read?
Yes. We read. I tried to push in breaker A and it's out, and as soon as we did we got an AC bus 1 light, a main bus A and a main bus B undervolt light. The breaker will not reset at this time. and it's fuel cell 1, AC pump breaker on 226.
Roger. That's the one. We're looking at it.
Okay. When I push it in, I get those three lights, AC bus 1, main bus A, and main bus B undervolts.
Roger, 10. We're working on it.
Say, Houston. This is 10.
Roger, 10. We're working on this problem. Stand by, please.
Okay. I just wanted to tell you. Of course, I got - There goes the fuel cell 1 light. I just expected it. I think it's probably because of a condenser exhaust temperature down around 154 degrees [Fahrenheit, 68°C]. Also the skin temperature is going up at this time, and we do have the fuel cell 1 light. The bus lights now are all reset and everything's normal from that. It's just fuel cell 1.
Roger. We copy and confirm.
[Garble] is 121:19. 6 more minutes.
Mission rules say come home on that, don't they?
If we lose another fuel cell, we go home? [Long pause.]
Shoot, if we lose one, we go home. Don't we?
Okay, I want to copy - copy this down, and let me get the Flight Plan.
Here you are, babe.
Just lose them?
Apollo 10. Houston. Here's what we'd like you to do on fuel cell 1. Open circuit fuel cell 1. Fuel cell 2 go to main bus A only. Fuel cell 3 go to main bus B only. Over.
Roger. You want me to open circuit fuel cell number 1. You want me to go fuel 2 to main bus A and fuel cell 3 to main bus B. I'll do it now.
Wait a second, here.
That's affirmative. We're standing by.
Go.
Apollo 10, Houston. In the event that you get an under voltage light, disregard the voltage and come right back up again.
Okay. I'm looking at 26.9 [volts] on both main A and main B at this time.
Did you open-circuit it? Did you open-circuit?
Yes. I don't like this. Shit, I just don't like this. We have to power down all this.
Roger 10. We copy. And it's looking good.
How good does all that look to you?
Say again, 10.
You want to go over this Orb Rate landmark tracking...
How good does all that really look to you?
Yes, you hold Orb Rate. Okay? And I'll - and if these times - You still...
We're assessing it right now.
Okay. I guess we're going to lose you in a couple of minutes here.
And, Houston. this is 10. Do you want me to maintain my battery charge on A at this time? [Long pause.]
I would say yes, to make sure those batteries are up.
Apollo 10. Houston. Terminate your battery A charge at this time and if we get a Cryo O2 heater cycle, well, you may lower the bus voltage momentarily. Over.
Okay. Fine. I understand. I'm terminating the battery A charge at this time. [Long pause.]
Surely we want to start powering down here and still go ahead.
Hey, that's those fuel cells one of [garble] do early TEI for loss of.
For one fuel cell?
Yes.
We come back early for that one.
As far as high [garble] for these items, early TEI will be delayed a reasonable time, pending completion of various lunar-orbit activities.
Houston, do you have a - What's your latest hack on when we'll have AOS, please?
[Garble].
AOS.
Oh, AOS.
Okay. AOS will be 122:06. And we'l1 be losing you in 2 minutes.
Roger. Roger. 122:06 and we're going to plan to continue on with the landmark tracking, and we'll talk to you about this as soon as we get AOS.
Roger. We'll have some new word for you then.
Okay. Thank you, Jack. [Long pause.]
We got a good state vector. Shit, we could burn the son of a bitch.
Yes, we could.
[Garble]. We're going to come back in the dark though, baby. We're going to land before sunrise [garble] a little bit.
Oh. God.
[Garble] a long time, baby.
Then going back slow wouldn't help that. You wouldn't want to go back slow.
Shit, no. When you make that burn, baby, you commit yourself when you splash down, whether you're fast or slow. You can't do anything about it.
In the dark?
That's right, baby. If we burn TEI the next rev around, we're coming back in the nighttime.
Okay, Houston. Apollo 10. I'm going to go ahead and start a roll around so I'll come around to a Orb Rate of 3 - I'll wait until after we get Loss Of Signal and pick up an Orb Rate of 339 for landmark tracking.
Roger. We copy.
Oh, man, I'm glad you didn't leave that fuel cell on while we were out there doing the rendezvous.
[Garble] getting so nervous I wouldn't know what to do.
[Garble] scared the living [garble] out of me if you had told me [garble].
Now we're sitting right at the point where we're almost going to get a [garble] every time those heaters cycle in this position.
You don't need the heaters anymore, you get that low.
26.5 to 26 inching to 27. Now I'm going to get the battery chargers off now.
Yes. Going to lose them in 2 minutes; I'm going to roll a hundred and - I'm going to rollover to zero zero, so we can - Stand by with black and white. This may be the only chance to be in color to pick up the earth in the sequence camera.
[Garble] already.
You got the color film in there? No black and white? I got this special color here. That color film - is that - that's still that color film...
[Garble] him out of the LM. That's the only stuff we got left. It came out of the LM.
Okay, let's [garble] fire down the checklist and see if there's a few things we can get off that [garble] maybe to help us a little bit.
Yes. Maybe that foldy junk. I could do without one of those GPI's, right now.
We don't need the hot-water heater, do we?
No, shit, no. Get that off.
[Garble].
What's this breaker that won't reset, babe?
Fuel Cell AC Bus 1. Fuel Cell Pump.
There you go. Look at it.
Don't put your hands on it.
No, I ain't pushing it in.
Okay, you got a powerdown checklist?
Mother's warm, too. Sure is.
Is it getting warm?
Yes.
It might cool off and come back and work for a while.
I wouldn't plan on that.
Yes, I wouldn't count on that at all.
Where in the hell is that emergency part? I wouldn't want an emergency powerdown.
The only power-down I could find was the emergency powerdown. In the LM - maybe it's in the LM where we got those others.
Are the others in here, John? The regular power-downs?
Should be in the handbook. Right?
You don't want to put any batteries on.
No.
[Garble] O2 Heaters and Radiator Heaters, Off. We'll leave those on, just the emergency powerdown. [Garble] Off. S-Band Power Amplifier, Off. Fuel Cell switch, Off.
Fuel Cell Pumps, Off.
What the hell are you looking at?
That's the emergency powerdown. [Garble].
That's if you catch fire.
This is if you catch fire. That's not what we're looking for.
No, it isn't. It's the regular emergency powerdown.
Okay.
You mean, [garble] babe? Here're two more. Didn't the LM - maybe I'm thinking of the LM, but in the LM we had a regular [garble].
Shit, there it is. Son of a bitch.
Freaking heaters. Turn the heaters off. Turn the heaters off.
Watch for a Master Alarm. I have to get it when [garble].
How low did the voltage get?
26.5.
What is it now?
27 - 26.8. Shit, babe. I don't like staying in lunar orbit like this.
I don't either. baby. All it takes is one of those fuel cells to freak out on us, and we're in deep yogurt.
You ain't shitting.
Let's go ahead get this landmark tracking out of...
I don't [garble] powerdown checklist in here.
We got a good state vector...
But take a look at what you've got powered up.
Let's see what [garble] state vector shows.
Right. [Garble] darned thumb. Yes. What the hell is that?
[Garble] turn the bright lights on?
Turn the lights off; we don't need those.
Rendezvous lights, EVA lights; we don't need those.
Was that - was that the cryo heaters?
I turned the cryo heaters off [garble] That's what he's doing.
Let me cycle them.
I can turn High Gain power off.
Yes, we don't need [garble]...
Does that help it any?
A little bit.
We'll need it when we come around, though.
We won't be able to get High Gain on these passes. We're going to be in Orb Rate. Do we have a TEI PAD for this time around?
Right now. We got 2 more hours to wait.
The TEI - what's the latest TEI PAD?
124:41.
Yes. Okay, we got...
What's the Delta-V?
Shit, babe, I don't think - we shouldn't - that is, we can't come back fast.
[Garble] 2992.
That isn't as fast as we came.
We're [garble] on 2900, Tom. 22.
[Garble] how fast you turn - the final one...
Yes, the final is 36, but...
Yes. Yes, that's - [garble] and then they start you home, and then you can work on it from there. I don't like those amber lights.
Me neither.
I don't like it either.
Tell them to go away.
[Garble].
122:06. When is this landmark tracking? Why don't we go ahead and give them a little data, so...
They ain't going to get much, I'll tell you that.
Yes.
[Garble] they had been here as long as we have...
Well, maybe we didn't lose it.
Yes.
[Garble] in the first rev around the Earth.
How about you, babe? At this point in time. I'd like to become a little bit conservative, I guess.
Yes, that's for sure. We tripped all the heck [garble] of everything. But what has it got on that list? When's John's first landmark track?
F-l is at 121:55.
Look at that solar corona!
Let's see if I can [garble] get a picture at it...
Look at it!
Turn these lights down.
Take a look. [Garble] out there, John. See it in the hatch?
No. I've got to do some updating here. Okay, check me on these numbers.
Alright. Let's go, baby.
[Garble] didn't pull it wide open. Yes.
It's a long [garble] have to take one at least 1 second long. What did you get on it? Why...
I'm not so fast.
About 4 seconds. [Garble]. Just hold it down. Hold up here she comes. Right now, babe; beautiful. Go.
Just real slow. I wonder if they're expecting to - Here it comes.
Wonder, if that thing gets like that with a fuel cell pump, what you do. Let's look at the malfunction procedures; maybe we have to shut that mother down, you guys.
I already did, babe.
Does it say? What does it say to do?
It is open-circuited, babe.
What - what are the temperatures doing?
They're safe, and stable. [Garble] Okay, let's pump them up again, John.
Okay.
You already got your P20...
I did them on [garble] pressure.
We going down?
Turn the heaters on one at a time. [Garble] the deadband.
Turn the heaters On on the lowest one. Leave the other one up. We can [garble] later.
Put them on one at a time.
You think we get a light? [Garble] off.
Put them on one at a time.
Is that the best way?
Right now it is.
There, 50 degrees to go.
Yes, this may be the only pass we get for landmark tracking.
Did you change your attitudes, Tom?
No. Trying to make this Orb Rate is so shitty I can't believe it. That's on the GDC.
You roll right-side up, right?
Yes. I couldn't call Verb 82 - a Verb 83 in it, could I?
No.
Huh?
No.
We've looked up the best [garble] the GDC and the IMU [garble] to have drifted off.
Yes.
Okay, we're going to be picking this up at - at the first one, John. At 21:39:49, that's when it's going to be coming on the horizon, and we'll get a T2 21:42:49.
Okay, this is the bulge on the other side of the...
How are the other two fuel cells' condenser and exhaust temperatures doing?
They're alright, John.
This is the one. The RP is 02:45 before then.
I'm going to turn on the other heater in Auto.
At the same time with the other one being on?
Yes.
Do we really need the heaters?
Yes.
Yes, you got to keep that cryo pumped up, babe.
Yes, we occasionally go to Manual on 1. Okay.
Gosh, I can't see the...
42:49; you got a minute and 15 seconds to go, John. It's just 85 degrees. And you should be seeing crater 225 coming up, babe.
Okay.
Okay, we're coming across. It's 225.
Okay, 225?
Yes.
And we got the next - that little one - that little blast right up on the rim and a deep one over on the left. And we should be there in about 20 seconds, where you should start marking, babe.
Where I can start marking?
Yes, 40 seconds. 20 seconds. 10 seconds now. Let me know when you mark. Call it out, and I'll track it. You should be - there. Have you marked yet?
No.
One.
Okay, good show.
You counting for me?
5 seconds, 8 seconds. 10 seconds, 15 seconds. 20 seconds, 24. 25 seconds.
Two.
Okay, two marks. 5 seconds, 10 seconds - I guess you could really say 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 25 seconds; three marks, John. Okay. 5 seconds, 10 seconds. 15, 20 seconds, 25 seconds; that's four. 5 seconds...
What's my' shaft. - what's my trunnion angle? Can you guys tell?
Can't see it. 10 seconds. Can you see, Gene-o, [garble]...
Huh?
[Garble].
[Garble] see any [garble] down there; there's nothing on the DSKY?
No.
Okay. 20 seconds, coming up on 23, 24, 25 seconds. Okay. you got them.
Beautiful.
They're fine.
[Garble] sure. The fuel cell is usable, but you got to take it on the line and put it off the line, and...
Without the pump?
Yes, but you got to watch your - your [garble].
You want me to copy these things down for you, John?
Yes, you can if you want.
What am I supposed to copy...
75, 85, 03, 000.
000, 8, hold it, 75, 0...
No, you don't have to copy that stuff down.
I don't.
We got to kind of hurry here, because we're...
Okay.
So we haven't lost it entirely
Okay, the next one is...
...[garble] we can't find it.
...next one is CP-2 mode?
Yes.
Okay, you're going to fire at 21:55, and you've got 11 minutes to go.
Okay, now we have to hold here for 30 seconds.
Okay. I'll time you on it. Did that work out pretty smooth?
[Garble].
Okay, babe.
And here's what we copy.
Oh, is that 89?
Yes, true.
This is where this little bear computes what it is, huh?
Yes.
Okay.
[Garble].
0, 1, 08, 108 - Wait a minute. 01089; that's 85323; and that's 00086, right?
Yes.
Okay, got it, John.
Okay, the next one is CP-2. Was that attitude pretty good for picking up to start with in there?
Great.
Okay, now the next one is...
You want a Verb 83 - 82?
Yes, a Verb 83. Give me one so I can flip your Orb Rate ball on - align to GDC for the IMU real fast, and I can just roll [garble].
P39.
Okay, hold on. Shit, I got roll zero. Pitch is what the hell's wrong here? I'll get this thing aligned real fast here.
What - what time is this next one?
At 55.
[Garble] in time.
[Garble] 6 minutes here. Okay, stand by and I'll get a good alignment here. To hell with that son of a bitch of a - That SCS is lousy, you know. Okay, Orb Rate on both.
Check.
Yes, now what was it. 340?
Yes.
Okay, I'll slew it in. I'm going...
35.
Okay.
340. All set?
Hang on, I'll be right there. I got it. Go, babe.
Okay.
You got it. Okay. Now. Orb Rate and we'll track it. Good show. Okay. Again, John, this is coming up to CP-1. Your zero time is going to be 21:55:10, and they got T2 at 21:55...
Want to check and make sure this is CP-2 landmark loaded in here?
Okay. [Garble] 1? You got it. All balls, go.
Oh, shit.
What happened?
We got 5 minutes to go, John. Any more on those malfunctions over there. Gene-o?
Yes, it says basically, "fuel cell used will maintain a skin temperature greater than 380 and by operation; less than 475 by open-circuiting; continuous hydrogen purge" - basically what it says. It's still available to us if you're going to monitor it - babysit with it. The thing that bothers me is this circuit breaker's [garble].
Okay, John. This one's going to be characteristic by - You're going to have big old crater number IX...
Yes, man.
...coming up, and I think I can - And that will be at 50 - I think I can help lead - I'm now at the [garble], so I can help lead you in.
(Yawn)
And, Gene-o, at 122, just while we're still here, get that camera set up at f:8 at 1/250 on the sequence, or f:11 at 1/250 - [garble] - and then that one set up so we can shoot the Earth. Okay?
Okay, I'm all squared away.
And it'll be at 122:06. So it'll be about 7 more minutes. I think I got this Orb Rate coming right down for you, babe.
Okay, we got about 2 minutes and 10 seconds, John, until you first pick it up.
Okay.
We've got 2 minutes?
You got about a minute and 10 seconds from the horizon.
Okay. The MIT.
And my IP.
Yes, we're coming right across crater number IX here, huh?
Yes.
Is your IP in the basin?
Yes.
Okay, you'll be at your angle at 56:52. About a minute and 40 seconds, John. Orb Rate is going just real good for you; it hasn't changed a bit.
Okay, here we go.
Okay. Oh, I got it for you. I can see it out there now.
But I don't see it.
May be down under you. They may have missed us a little bit. 56:52. There's still another minute. I can see it up there; it's a little pimple on the edge of the side of the crater. I can see the son of a bitch from here. John.
It's only 155 - 156:04 now. right?
We're headed right for it - may be a little to your left.
I got it.
Okay, babe. At 56:52. in about 30 seconds. and I'll be marking. You tell me on the first mark. You're 30 seconds from the first mark. 20 seconds. Okay. about 10 seconds, John. When you first start marking, let me know, babe.
Okay.
Mark.
Okay. 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15, 20, 25. You got two marks, John. 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 25 seconds.
Oh, shit. I lost it.
30. 40. You got a mark? Two marks. Okay. and then that one is 10 seconds, 15, 20, 25. 30, 35. 40...
I lost it.
You lost it, huh?
Yes, [garble].
You got three marks. Is that any good?
Yes.
Okay. [Garble].
No, the problem is we wasn't rolled, and I should have thought to roll us. What did it say that it was, north - north or south of the land track that time? Damn, I forgot all about that.
5 miles - it is north 5 miles.
What's - what's F-1?
F-l is north 10 miles.
Okay, so F-l is north 10 miles. So we ought to roll right about 5 degrees.
Roll right. huh?
Roll left. Excuse me.
Roll [garble], Okay. F-l is 20...
North is up that-a-way. ain't it?
Which way. John?
We're coming around the Moon like this...
We're coming around from...
North is up to the right.
Okay, so we want to roll left 5 degrees.
North is to the right. Yes.
We want to roll right. We want to roll right 5 degrees. We want to roll into it 5 degrees.
Roll right 5 degrees.
Yes.
I'll go ahead and do that for you. Okay, the next one is 122:07, and we have acquisition at 122:06. We've got 6 minutes to acquisition. Gene-o.
Okay, you don't have any clean Kleenex, do you?
Yes, I got a semi one here, babe.
Acquisition is 06:00.
Okay, F-l should stand out like a sore thumb for you. It's that bright little rascal out there. Once we pop over into...
Let's see if I'm rolling us right.
Okay. F-1.
Plus 43440. Plus 00000.
Yes. Your [garble] ought to get us up on top here. Okay. John.
Okay? I guess you shoot the F-l when it first comes up.
It's got to be f:11. Tom. It's so bright.
Yes. it's got to be f:11 at 1/250 - on both of them, right? Okay. babe. Get the slide out. and we'll be all set. We'll make these go boom, boom, boom. Is that the black - the color I had in the...
This is the color we had in the LM.
Yes.
That voltage is holding above [garble] 7, and I've cycled the [garble, should be 'cryo'] heaters one at a time.
122:07. Oh, we've got a ways to go. We'll have acquisition from the Earth soon.
Now. if that isn't a tan color, absolutely tan, I don't know what the hell is.
All these TEI PADs don't - don't get you back any faster than the other ones, huh?
Oh, that's right. About 2,900 feet per second [880 m/s]. Shit, no, babe. You're going for about 76 hours going home, instead of 57.
Is that right?
That's right.
Shit. Well, the only advantage to that that I can see is that experts will be there to tell you what the hell to do. I don't know what to do with that son of a bitch when the light comes on. Shit. Throw up my hands and holler and pass out at the sight of a thing that runs on electricity with its main bus voltages [garble].
Yes.
Okay, we're all set to shoot now.
The question is, are you better off in lunar orbit than you are coming back?
Oh, yes.
I guess I'll have to believe you're better off to start back. You can make a one-battery entry with a ... meter, but you can't do nothing if you can't light those engines.
Yes, I'd like to be out of lunar orbit; then you [garble] get back into - get back into Omni antenna [garble] the power S-band; you can do lots of those little things that are...
Okay, we'll get this marked at 122:07. I got some IP way out in front, José.
Good show. It's bright out there, man.
Oh, I didn't write down what CP-2 had when you...
I got it.
You do?
Plus 00626.
Hold it, 00...
626.
Yes.
Plus 63996, plus 00071.
00771.
No. 00071.
Okay. Freaking Sun. 05:36, Gene-o, and. as soon as it starts. There's nearly 22:08, John.
There it is.
Hit it, quick. Go, baby, go.
What?
The Earth. Hit it. Again, baby...
Jesus Christ.
Are you aiming at it right now?
I know where this one is.
Beautiful, Gene-o.
Think I can get...
Sounds like we're about to acquire.
Yes, we are.
Might shoot an f:8 - 80 on it. Oh, 250 will be good.
[Garble].
Huh? My deadband is washed out completely.
You want to try to place your color back on it?
[Garble].
Oh, you did? Oh, Okay.
You sure did. Okay, 07:55, you should first see it. Here, I got Smyth's Peak coming up here.
What do you use the setting at, Tom? In roll, 5 degrees to the right, right?
Yes, we'll roll 5 - we'll use the same setting [garble].
Roll 5 degrees to the right, right?
[Garble] mascon.
Okay. Well, maybe - just shoot a couple on each side. f:8, f - shoot an f:8 and an f:11.
Yes, I am. I'm going to shoot them both.
Apollo 10, Houston. Standing by.
Roger. We're right square in the middle of a landmark tracking.
We should hold on the horizon. And at 22...
Roger. And we've cranked up a plan-of-attack on that fuel cell.
Okay. Can you hold off for just a couple minutes? We'll be right with you.
Okay, we're coming across it.
When is zero time?
Zero time is 122:10:06.
Okay, about 2 minutes.
2 minutes.
[Garble] plan of attack on the fuel cells. We kicked the shit out of it, huh?
Yes, I bet I know what they'll do.
They'll just bring us home.
They'll bring it on the line while we're on the back side and shut it off around on the front side. You want to bet?
Okay, you got the landmark?
Not yet.
I'll [garble] for you guys, but I don't want to interfere with your...
Okay, 22 - it just won't take but a minute. 22:10:06. Just about 20 seconds, John. Let me know when.
I haven't got it yet.
Okay.
Oh, hell, there it is. Damn near overshot it.
Do you want me to pitch down for you?
Yes.
Okay, you got some pitchdown. Okay.
Oh, shit.
Pitch down some more?
No.
Let me know when.
Okay.
Mark it.
5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 25 seconds.
Mark.
You've got two of them. 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 25 seconds. Got three of them. 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 25 seconds. You got four. 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 25 seconds. You got five. There you go, babe. Do I have to hold this attitude, or can I pitch down?
No, you can pitch back up, if you will?
Okay, Houston, Apollo 10. Go ahead. We're between the F-1 and 130 sites.
Okay. Tom. Here is our plan-of-attack on this fuel cell. First, we're going to look at the fuel cell temperature for a little while, and after we've done that, we're going to put it back on line to look at the temperatures it generates versus its loading. And then we're going to work up a fuel cell purge. We've got 25 hours of hydrogen purging available. Looks like we've lost a pump package in that fuel cell 1, but we're going to maintain the temperatures of the fuel cell by purging it, and then we'll use the cell only for burns, et cetera. At the present time, we're not proposing any changes in the Flight Plan, and we expect when it goes back on line it will go on both main A and main B, and so at this time we're working up a purge cycle and looking at your fuel cell. Over.
Okay, real good. Thank you, Jack.
Okay, Jack. We did - when the heater cycled, we were looking at about 20 to 20.2 volts and we've got the main bus voltage undervolts light. I've been cycling the heaters to the Auto position on the Cryos, one at a time, as they appeared to need it. It's just not a good feeling to have those lights - undervolts lights come on in here. I've also temporarily turned the power on the High Gain Antenna, Off, until we can catch a High Gain again.
Roger. We copy.
And we've also turned - We've also turned the potable H2O heater, Off. Just some other small things to start saving power.
Roger. High Gain Antenna, and Potable Water Heater, Off.
So, Jack. If you see my Cryo pressure dropping, don't hesitate to tell me to get the heater On. I just don't like to put all four of them on. We split the load when we get the lights on.
Roger. Understand you're cycling your Cryo heaters, and we'll watch the temperatures.
Thank you.
Okay, John. This 130 is 1 nautical mile to the north.
That look right for the numbers I'm supposed to load in - 1 north?
Yes.
Okay, roll right 10 - go right 11 degrees.
Okay.
When do we come up on it?
You acquire at 122:29; you've got 13 minutes to go.
Okay.
What were the numbers - is this the numbers that you got, babe?
That's all the numbers I got.
That 89, that's the numbers you got.
Yes.
Well, you just loaded - What were the numbers you got on F-1?
01977.
That was 019...
Plus 44157.
...plus 44...
Minus 00259. Let me see what I got on F-l the other day.
Minus 00259?
Yes. I'll put that down.
What was the first one? Plus?
Plus. Yes, plus 01991. Okay.
Okay, you rolled 11 degrees.
Let me see the Flight Plan.
There it is. Here you go, babe.
When did we get into lunar orbit?
It was 70 - what? 15 something - 16.
Okay. I hear that goddam Master Alarm; it's still ringing in my ears.
Can you track the landing site?
[Garble].
What have you got in there?
I didn't write it down...
I got a good one out here. Ready to go?
Yes.
Hold it. I'm talking about the targets of opportunity.
Well, what time is this other thing here, Tom?
We got a ways to go; we're not even up to landing site 1 yet; we're just coming up to Messier - to Secchi. You got the Flight Plan babe; it's 129 something.
According to this here, we're coming up on it.
130? Well, shucks: we couldn't be, baby. I just got a big old Taruntius out there
Did I load the wrong numbers?
Can't be.
Yes, there's Taruntius H, G, P, and Q right up here.
Let's look at what the Flight Plan says. It's 129 something.
Well, it's 122:20 - 122:19 or...
Huh?
What time does the Flight Plan say?
122:20 or...
Well, you got the Flight Plan?
Yes, here you go. Shit.
It's 129, John. 122:29, so we got 9 minutes. It's by Landing Site 2, you know. That little pimple on the side of 130.
Yes. Oh - there's the Taruntius twins, there.
Yes, can you see them pretty well?
Yes.
What we'll do is Messier.
Tom, could you pitch over about 5 degrees?
Yes.
And hold that attitude, whatever it is?
Right there?
Yes.
There's Mount Marilyn.
Here comes big old Maskelyne, way up there.
That bright one; is that Censorinus?
Yes, Censorinus A. I'm holding you right on 11 degrees, John.
Okay.
I sure hope f:8's going to be alright for looking at this Moon with this color film.
Okay, your IP on this one is Maskelyne B. You got a little blooper right up here on Maskelyne B, and I can lead you into that, babe. How much color film we got left?
I don't know.
We'll shoot some on the way - of the Earth - going back.
Do you have that special color film on while I'm tracking for John, here?
No, I don't have it on, Tom. Got black and white on.
Okay.
Now's the time to get the world coming up.
No, your world's done gone way behind us, babe.
Oh, have you already missed it?
Yes, it'll be on the zero horizon at 29:03.
We already got it, huh?
Oh, yes; I could see the son of a bitch out there. Oh, I got the landing site; I got Moltke, Messier, [garble] the blooper, and shit, we're all set, babe. You want to pop a quick one of Censorinus here?
Yes.
Don't wait too long, because I - too short...
[Garble] to here. Let me get the site through it.
[Garble] Landing Site 1 [garble].
There's the...
Here you go, Gene-o.
Apollo Ridge.
Yes.
[Garble] coming up, babe. Okay, we're going to be there at 2:20 - 2:29.
It's really baldy, isn't it?
Yes.
That's a bright little bastard.
Yes, I'll bet you can really see boulders on it.
Yes.
Okay, your IP lead-in is Maskelyne B, and you should just be starting to see it now. I got the landing site.
Boot Hill.
Let me get that one for a while, will you?
Duke Island and Boot Hill. There we go.
You got it? Okay, at...
I don't have it.
...29:03. It should be up on your horizon...
You're a ways out. babe.
...and at 22:30...
There's Dry River. Little Big Snake and Little Snake Rille.
I got it.
Okay.
There's Moltke, huh?
You better believe it. Okay. John. Let me know when you want to mark.
Good.
We're shooting at 30:37. You got about 30 seconds to go.
Yes.
I got one for you there just standing out loud and clear; that pimple oil the edge of the crater. And I've got that crater; it's as big as [garble] I got these three balls [garble].
Okay. there's [garble].
Yes. Stand by on the mark, babe.
There we go.
Did you get one?
No, I ain't got one yet. When do you want one?
Any time now; you're good; you're good; you're Go.
Go.
Did you get one?
Go.
Okay. Okay. Okay, 10 seconds gone. 15, 20, 25. That makes two. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. That makes three. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. That makes four, John. One to go, babe. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. That makes five. You got them. Proceed. All we need.
Yes, that's it, too. That's the right one. God, it's hard to recognize things [garble].
How are your eyes doing? Pretty bad?
Burning like a son of a bitch.
Houston, Apollo 10. We've just finished tracking Landmark 130. [Pause.]
Yes, got them on Omni. Should have them on Omni. We - For landmark tracking, we have to have - use Omni.
Hello, Houston. Apollo 10.
Now, listen. We got to let it run - run for 30 seconds.
Apollo 10, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. We've just finished Landmark 130. We've got them all in.
Very good. We have ginned up a fuel cell 1 plan. Over.
Okay. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Houston, 10. You got the data off 130?
Houston. Say again, please.
Roger. Do you have the data off 130 yet?
Stand by. [Pause.]
That's affirmative, 10. We've got the data off 130 now.
Okay. When we're at real time, I'll just hold on. I understand this is the one that's really important, so I can hang on to this until you give me a Go.
Roger. That's fine. And we got it now. [Long pause.]
Want me to read that stuff to you? Okay, Gene-o. Stand by to copy this stuff.
Alright.
This is working real good, Tom; boy, it's just beautiful.
For the fuel cell. Are you still shooting pictures?
No, I'm not.
Okay. The camera's still clicking.
Go ahead, Houston. This is 10, with your fuel cell plan.
Okay. Fuel cell plan is relatively simple. We're just going to leave it off line, open circuit, and we want you to turn the fuel cell 1 inline heaters off and then monitor the skin temperature. Monitor the temperature to stay between 390 and 410 [°F, 199° and 210°C], cycling the inline heaters on and off to maintain 390 to 410 [°F, 199° to 210°C]. This will keep our water production to a minimum, reducing our requirement to purge, and we may be able to go as long as 50 hours in this manner without purging. During the day, we will work out procedures to use during your sleep period on skin temperature. Over.
Okay, Jack. You must have been reading the same malfunction procedures I was. The fuel cell heater has been off now ever since we went through LOS. I've got a question on the heater. It's an Auto heater, which recycles somewhere around 380, 390 degrees [°F, 193°, 199°C]. Do you just want me to turn it to Auto position if it starts dropping, is that correct?
Negative, 10.
Or am I wrong about that heater?
You finished, John?
We want you to manually keep the temperature between 390 and 410 [°F, 199° and 210°C] by cycling the heater switch. Over.
You finished, babe?
For these four.
What are you reading on the heater - the skin temperature right now?
Stand by.
Okay. I've got to go inertial. Pitch around so we'll pick it up on the other side.
Right now, we're reading skin temperature of 423 [°F, 217°C], 10.
Yes, but we've got to get a realign, don't we?
Yes. But I'd do this first so you can get a realign, see? Here we're come around and I'll pitch around.
Okay. I'm reading about 430 [°F, 221°C], I guess, and it's been pretty stable. I'll turn the heater On, say down around 390 [°F, 199°C], and keep it between 390 and 410 [°F, 199° and 210°C].
Gimbal and pitch.
Roger, And whenever you've got some time there, we would like to update your state vector and pass you some PADs.
Okay. We're in Accept.
Roger, 10. [Pause.]
Okay. I'm ready to copy your PAD, and I guess I've got another question. You might be thinking up some words and things we can pull off the line here pretty quick in case we do get some under-volting problems going behind the backside, and I'm ready to copy your PAD.
Roger. We're working on that and we will give you the word. I have a map update PAD, Rev-25: 123:18:32, 123:29...
Hold it.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hold it, hold it.
Hey, Jack. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Jack. I thought you meant a PAD. Wait. We've got to get the right book out here. Hold it. Start it over again.
Roger, I have a maneuver PAD.
Go ahead with Rev-25, now.
Okay, Rev-25.
Fixing to do a map update. Over.
123:18:32, 123:29:36, 124:04:21; sunrise, 123:32:14; sunset, 124:44:39. Over.
Roger. 123:18:32, 123:29:36, 124:04:21, 123:32:14, 124:44:39, Rev-25.
Roger. Want you to check the AOS to be 124:04:21; sunset, 124:44:39.
I concur.
Okay. I've got a landmark tracking PAD.
Go ahead.
Okay. Charlie Papa 1: 123:38:14, 123:41:13, three balls, 051, three balls, north 13 miles, 12, 41. Charlie Papa 2: 123:53:35, 123:55:17, three balls, north 05, 04, 42. Foxtrot 1: 124:06:20, 124:08:30, three balls, 329, three balls, north 10, 10, 40. Landmark 130: 124:27:28, 124:29:00, three balls, 265, three balls, north at 12, 12, 41. Give me a readback and tell me when you are ready for a maneuver PAD. Over.
Roger.
CP-1: 123:38:14, 123:41:13, all balls, 051 , all balls, north 13, 12, 41. CP-2: 123:53:35, 123:55:17, all balls, 007, all balls, north 05, 04, 42. F-1: 124:06:20, 124:08:30, all balls, 329, all balls, north 10, 10, 40. 130: 124:27:28, 124:29:00, all balls, 265, all balls, north at 12, 12, 41.
Readback correct.
Ready for the PAD.
Okay. This is TEI number 25, SPS/G&N: 36750, minus 0.61, plus 0.75; 125:40:03.81. plus 3100.8, plus 0011.2, plus 0115.4; roll is NA, pitch is 064, and the rest is NA. Your ullage is two jets for 14 seconds. Over.
Roger. TEI 25, SPS/G&N: 36750, minus 0.61, plus 0.75; 125:40:03.81; plus 31008, plus 00112, plus 01154. Roll is NA, pitch is 064, and two jets for 14 seconds.
Roger. That's a good readback, and we're finished with our uplink. The computer is yours; go to Block. Over.
Okay. We're in Block. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is 10. That F-l was right near the subsolar point, and boy I really had a lot of trouble trying to figure out transfer. You could see it okay in the telescope but when you transfer from the telescope to the sextant it just vanishes.
Roger, 10. What target was that?
F-1.
Roger. F-1.
CP-2 is sort of that way, too.
Roger. [Pause.]
Okay, Houston. Apollo 10. I'm going to pitch around and go to 092, inertial.
Roger, 10.
It doesn't vanish. It's there, but you just can't see it. That sounds kind of funny. It's got the landmark in there, landmark line of sight and the lunar line of sight in there, all in one in the sextant, and you've got two different images and they're so bright it just doesn't - unless it has the dark feature in it, which most of these places don't. You just isn't recognizable.
Roger, 10. Understand it's hard to see because it's bright as opposed to its size. Is that affirmative?
That's correct.
I just don't get any definition. It's a bright blob down there, and there's whole bunch of bright blobs down there.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 10, Houston. John, wherever you have a target that looks too bright in the sextant, we just recommend finding it in the telescope and using it that way. Over.
Apollo 10, Houston. How do you read?
Apollo 10, Houston. Standing by. Over.
Roger. We're just squared away down to a better IMU align attitude. Over.
Roger. And I'd like to tell John that he can use the telescope where necessary, if field of view in the sextant is too bright.
Okay. I'm outstanding. 130 is no problem; that's easy to get, so I used the sextant on it. But maybe on F-1 and CP-2, I'll use the telescope.
Roger. Go ahead and use that telescope if it's too bright to get in the sextant. [Long pause.]
Boy! Whoever thought of using the telescope on landmark tracking.
Say again, 10. [Pause.]
I was just making a facetious remark.
Roger. That's what I thought. And they'll buy the telescope data. And we'd like to have the High Gain Antenna for a dump. Over.
Okay, Jack. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is 10. Can you give us some...
Apollo 10, Houston. Say again, please. [Long pause.]
Could you give me some High Gain angles, please, for my attitude?
Standby. [Long pause.]
This is Capcom.
Go ahead, Houston. [Pause.]
Apollo 10, Houston. If you haven't found them already, it's pitch minus 70, yaw 192. Over.
Roger, I got them; [garble]. I'll be with you in a minute.
Houston, you got us now?
Hello there, Apollo 10. Houston is reading you loud and clear. We're going to start the dump.
Okay. She's all yours.
Roger. And your LOS will be at 123:18, about 17 minutes. And we owe you a powerdown list.
Roger. Will you have it by then? Over.
If we don't, we'll find out why.
Okay.
Apollo 10, Houston. We have some information on potential powerdown items. Over.
Stand by.
Okay, Jack. Go ahead.
Okay. If you don't want to interfere with tracking and photography operations, there's not much more that you can power down that you've not already powered down. However, if you elect to terminate your tracking and photography operations, refer to checklist page S2-8 which is powerdown, SPS burn. Start at the top and start powering down those items. However, do not power down Batt C. Delete Batt C on Main A and B from the checklist and delete fuel cell pumps, 3, Off. Delete those two items and use that powerdown checklist as your guide. Over.
Okay, Jack. Yes, I was looking at that. I guess what I was looking for was some words on - not on emergency powerdown but, you know, in case this Undervolt comes on and persists to stay on, there might be a few other little things that we've overlooked, like I'm playing these heaters manually. We turned the portable heater off and turn the S-band off when we lose you, and a few of those things. I wasn't looking for the emergency conditions, just maybe a few good words or something that would be very obvious to you and not to us.
Roger. You've already done a pretty good job of figuring that out, Gene.
Okay. We thank you.
Okay, Houston. Apollo 10. Just keep us informed, because this landmark tracking is real important. We'll get this bear wired down and we've already got one set, and we're going to continue on here and we'll monitor this cell. And, naturally, if the thing really starts to go out on us, we know what the mission rule is on it. But right now, we plan to continue on and primarily concentrate on the landmark tracking. We've shot so much photography we're about out of color film. We're saving a little bit for the way back. And we still have some black and white to go, and we'll do some of that, but the main thing we're going to concentrate on now is the landmark tracking. Over.
Roger, Tom. We see no reason to change your plan of attack, and we have a change to landmark tracking update PAD Foxtrot 1. Over.
Okay. Stand by and I'll copy it. [Pause.]
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. On Rev-25, target Foxtrot 1, the T2 time should be changed. T2 should be 124:08:03.
Okay. I got: 03 vice 30.
Roger. That's affirmative. And so far, all the tracking data looks real good.
Roger. Thank you. You got a pretty good way to evaluate it in real time, there? Over.
That's affirmative.
I didn't get all the marks on one of those places, because - because I lost it in the sextant.
Roger. We copy, 10.
I forget, It's one of the CPs back there. It's not 1.
It's CP-2.
Roger. We detected that on CP-2, but 130 is the real important one, and that's coming through real good.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 10, Houston. We have a revision to the way in which we'd like you to maintain temperature in the Cryo tanks. Over.
Okay, Jack. Go ahead.
Roger. Instead of using your heaters to maintain the temperature in the Cryo tanks, use your fans manually. Over.
Okay. Use the fans to maintain the pressure in the Cryo tanks. Right? Is that correct?
Use the fans to maintain the temperature in the Cryo tanks. This will be - correction - pressure. This will require less current and allow finer control. Over.
Very good. Thank you. Those are the kind of good words I really wanted. Thank you very much.
Roger. We'll try to think up some more.
Apollo 10, Houston. You're going around the corner in about a minute and a half. Your AOS is 124:04, and we'd like you to check and make sure the VHF is all Off. Over.
That's a good point.
124:04, and we'll check.
Yes, Jack. I checked. All the VHF switches are all Off.
Check the T/R switches. They could be on. As a matter of fact, we can turn off those switches on the audio control panel. There was no need - bad Comm.
Oh, I've already turned all those off.
Roger. Thank you.
Okay. Ain't many we don't need.
Pshew!
TEI is 3,600 and some feet per second [1,100 m/s].
Yes. 3,650 [fps, 1,110 m/s].
I don't understand why, if you acquire it now, you can't get back...
Okay. That worries me a little.
What you got - you got the Moon? I'll take it around the end of your land until you got the antipode, Okay?
Yes.
That's because you want to land at a certain place.
Okay, that's right.
Okay, that's because you want to land - No, there ain't no way out...
No way. So the main thing - once you foul up, regardless whether you come - you're - you're in a curve that comes like this...
Yes, but you're shooting for a specific landing point. That's why you're saying - I mean - you think you - The landing point is - is a - is a the end is - a - independent variable - it doesn't move. Is that right? If you were willing to accept - a change in the landing point, you could...
Oh, yes.
...you could fire now and still get back in a short time.
Yes, but you might come down in the Indian Ocean.
Yes, yes; I agree. But - but, a - Okay. But it's the landing point that's fixed - Oh, I could see that, because the Earth - soon as you're rotating around the Earth, then the Earth is also rotating that landing point around, so that - it's at a different point in respect to the axis.
Yes, once you foul - regardless of how long it takes you - whether 52, 74, 104 - then it won't change it hardly a bit when you get down, as far as time of day.
Yes.
There. We're on the point.
I wonder if we've been using our other heaters.
No.
...ought to eat you alive on that. Maybe we ought to turn our primary ECS heater Off, like.
Our what?
That's probably not ever going to come on. But why should it even be on in the first goddam place...
Yes, it's a - it's Auto, so - that's been working so fine, babe, that we're - we're above 27 volts. I've been watching it. We've been hanging about 27 volts [garble].
Man, if it comes on; it's going to eat you alive.
Hey, we got a landmark track coming up here when the Sun comes out.
Yes.
I think it's been - we've been working it out pretty good. John.
Yes. I think that's great. Tom. It's perfect. It'll be a piece of cake to track, too, once you find out where the hell they're at.
[Garble]. Ohh. [Garble].
How's GDC doing so bad?
This thing is drifting - 10 degrees every hour and a half to 2 hours.
I think it's a - just about - You know what the spec is on that shit? It's like 7 degrees an hour, anyway. Not a very good system, near as I can figure.
Psheeew! Okay. let me take a look at the Flight Plan. Gene-o. [Garble] all night.
CP-1 is 1 - 13 miles north. Now, is that far enough north?
Yes, you don't have to roll for CP-1.
Okay, but now, CP-2's where we got in trouble.
Yes. So you ought to roll 5 degrees...
Right.
...right.
There's 5 miles...
It's between 5 and 10.
And F-1 is 10 degrees more.
Yes. We didn't have to roll for F-1, but we did anyway, just in case.
And we rolled right?
Right. Right. You roll right. You roll into them, generally speaking.
Yes.
Unless they go over about 30 miles [48 km] north, and then you got to roll away from.
Christ, I've killed my muscles. They're just going to hell in a handbasket.
Yes, I can, too. We'll get out Exer-Genie tomorrow.
Okay. I think that's a good idea.
Okay. CP-1 at 123:38. 14 minutes.
You - I'll go ahead - you go ahead and take the DSKY.
You got it?
No, you got it.
You want it?
No. Shit, no. I've got - I'm calibrated, babe. Oh, look. I've got to get this time set up, here.
What kind of time do you want?
From 150 west at 123:29:36.
Okay.
No, you won't be able to see for 6 months after we get back.
Nahhh?
Because I had like one-tenth or what you're doing, but looking through that thing is just - it just I had one-twentieth or what you're doing, and...
What happened to the map?
