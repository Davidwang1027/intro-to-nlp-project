You got them on C [Omni]? Have you got lock-on?
Ive got - I'm halfway locked on.
[Garble].
Houston, Apollo 10 on Omnis. Over.
Well, they were - What should we go do?
What did you get, Tom?
I've got them on [garble] It's just about halfway up, Gene-o.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 10.
B, C, D.
Should I go to another one?
Shit, I don't know!
Snoopy, this is Houston. We're standing by. How do you read?
A and B.
I don't think - Ain't B on the top? Well, I don't know; maybe that's the one we ought to be on. A, B - not B, no, not B; B is down there by the high gain. A, B - should be D. Try D.
Hello, Snoopy. Houston. We're standing by.
D? Does D override everything? Omni D?
Sound better?
Where do you have to have it to have it in Omni D? Where's the other one have to be? A, B, and C?
It doesn't make it any difference. Omni D takes it.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 10. Okay, José. You should have that one at 43:47. In 2 more minutes, you're going to be there.
Okay. By God, there's the Smyth's Sea.
Pitch going to Accel Command.
Okay, but don't do anything until I tell you.
Okay, when you want 0.3 degree?
Yes.
Okay, here's the first clue.
Coming in on it, babe.
Yes.
Good show.
Snoopy, Houston. Standing by.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 10. I can barely hear him.
Hello, Snoopy. This is Houston. How do you read?
Okay, babe.
Say when, babe. I got 43:18, 20; 27 more seconds.
Okay, stand by.
Apollo 10, Houston. How do you read?
Mark it.
Go? 0.3?
Hey, tell them...
Whoa!
...I read them loud and clear.
Tell me when you start marking, babe; and I'll...
I just did.
I didn't hear it.
Tell me when - I've only got about 0.1 on that. About 20 seconds gone, babe.
Okay, hack it again.
Okay, need down?
Huh?
Put - put you down some more?
Yes. Real good.
40 seconds, there. Okay, looking good.
Apollo 10, this is Houston. How do you read?
10 seconds gone. 15. 20 seconds. Coming up to 25 seconds, John. 30 seconds. Beautiful.
[Garble] burn data?
No.
No. We're doing some tracking. Okay, 15 seconds gone.
Got 20 seconds gone. 25 seconds, babe. And 30 seconds.
Okay.
Got it?
Five marks.
Yes.
Okay, what do you pitch to?
Oh, about 3...
[Garble].
Yes, what Omni?
Did you [garble]?
No, what Omni? I'm on D.
They're calling you and you're calling me, but I can't talk to them; my ...
What Omni? I had it on D, what...
Huh?
What Omni? What's the best one? I've got Omni D on here. Hello, Houston; Apollo 10.
Hello, Snoopy. This is Apollo - This is Houston.
Hello, Joe. How do you read? This is Charlie Brown.
Hello, Apollo 10. This is Houston. Reading you real weak, Tom.
Charlie Brown. Okay. Look, we're right in the middle of our landmark tracking, and Gene-o is reading you loud and clear. Over.
Okay, Tom. Understand you're reading us loud and clear, and is Gene-o in Snoopy yet?
Stop the pitch.
...Gene-o in Snoopy yet?
Maneuver to 274 (degrees pitch for landmark tracking target B-1).
Okay, I need to pitch down some more. See?
Okay. Sure, he's in Snoopy. He's been calling you on the S-band. He hears you loud and clear.
Yes. He's in Snoopy. [Garble] S-band [garble] loud and clear.
Okay, Snoopy. This is Houston. We're picking you up now, Gene-o, and we can go ahead with this voice check now. If you'll give me a long count in each of your three modes, we'll see how it works out. And, if you would, identify which mode you're in.
Shit, there's the Earth.
And, if you would, identify which mode you're in.
What's the - what's the next time that...
Okay, the next time you're - you're going to be zero at 55 and at 83, you'll be T-2, 83 hours and 50 minutes.
Okay.
José, you're at 274 (pitch 274°).
Okay.
Charlie Brown, this is Houston.
Go ahead. Over. Go ahead. Over.
Houston, this is Charlie Brown. Go ahead.
Charlie Brown, Houston.
Go ahead there, Joe. We read you loud and clear.
[Garble]. We're reading you loud and clear.
Okay, Charlie Brown, I understand you're reading us loud and clear. You're breaking up pretty badly, and just about unreadable. I wonder if you could give us an idea, is Snoopy ready to try the checks from his end yet?
Tell them I'm listening.
He's hearing you loud and clear. He's listening to you. He's ready to try the checks.
[Garble].
[Garble].
Yes, he's on...
[Garble]. You got the S-band volume on. What'd you do? Turn off the suit power...
[Garble] through here, and tell them [garble].
Okay, you want to turn on your suit power or anything?
Tom, I'll talk to them. Put my suit power on, would you?
Okay, babe.
Would you check, is my audio power on?
Suit Power, On; Audio Power, On; S-band, T/R. You've got it.
We're yawing off a couple of degrees. That going to hurt you?
No.
Okay, John.
Oh, come on, you bastard.
Hello, Houston, Houston; this is LMP in Snoopy. How do you read me?
Houston, Houston, LMP in Snoopy. How do you read me?
Okay, Snoopy. We caught that one, Gene-o. And how do read Houston?
I'm reading you loud and clear; the only problem is, I'm on Command Module hoses down here, I'm at Command Module comm. Everything's squared away; everything's going fine. I'm waiting for you to come over the hill, and I can read you loud and clear, but you cannot read me from Snoopy. Over.
Okay, you're pretty tough to make out in this mode, Gene-o. We'll go ahead and catch the long counts though, if you want to give us a long count in each of your three modes. Go ahead and identify which mode you're in.
Houston, Houston, I'm on - I am on CSM comm; I'm on Charlie Brown comm. I can read you when I go to Snoopy comm, but you cannot read me. Over.
Okay, Snoopy. We copy. You're on CSM comm and you can read us when you're on Snoopy's comm, but we're not picking you up at all. Okay, stand by just a minute, Gene; and, in the meantime, how's the snow situation up there?
It's pretty lousy. Everything in the LM is Go. I'll give you all the readings when I get back in the CSM. Everything's going along great except the comm, and I can read you loud and clear on Snoopy comm, but you're not reading me at all.
Okay, we understand, Gene-o. Stand by here.
You might have me verify some switches to make sure I got them all, but I think I did.
(Cough)
Okay, that sounds like a good idea.
Okay, Snoopy; this is Houston. Do you want us to go through your switch list here to confirm these?
I guess. Unless you got a better idea, we might just as well.
What time we supposed to be over this one?
Okay, 82:55 we'll be coming and then at 82:56, we're coming to here.
Okay, Snoopy. Your Audio (LMP); we want the S-band T/R to Transmit/Receive.
That's go.
VHF A, Transmit/Receive.
Go.
VHF B to Receive.
Go.
S-band TM, Primary to Primary; Down Voice Backup, PCM, Off-Reset, Off, Low.
Okay, I got all of those.
VHF A Transmitter to Voice...
Let me pitch up a little bit here; kick it off.
...VHF B Receiver, On; and S-band Antenna, Forward.
Okay, you got all those.
Okay, that - that should hack it, Gene-o.
Okay, can EECOM think of any circuit breakers that might be out? I've double checked everywhere, and I can't see anything that's out on this end. Why don't you have a quick double check and then I'll switch back to Snoopy Comm?
What time is that thing coming up, Tom?
82:55:47.
Okay, Snoopy. We're looking at the circuit breakers, now.
I'd sure like to complete this on this front-side pass, if we can; for time reasons and also for power reasons.
Roger that, Snoop. Snoopy, we're getting real good data. It's just our
Okay, and I'm reading you loud and clear when I go on Snoopy comm. It's just in case of you not reading me, I guess.
Sounds like they've got the problem.
Okay, 82:55:47; it'll be on the horizon just about - about another minute, John; it'll be on the horizon, babe.
Okay.
Goddam LM is sticking down right in the middle of it.
I'll keep track of these marks for you. Okay?
Okay.
You can call off "mark."
Okay.
Okay.
82:55:47; we're supposed to be on the horizon, huh?
[Garble] 0, 21.
Okay.
What'd we do, lose them completely?
No.
Sure sounded like it.
We've got lock; just like it is.
Okay, it should be on the horizon now, 10 seconds...
Hello, Houston; this is LMP from Snoopy. How are you reading?
Boy, you're coming through loud and clear.
Yes, but I'm on your comm; you're supposed to be listening to me on intercom.
Good.
Snoopy, this is Houston. Go ahead, Gene.
How are we doing, Joe?
We're trying to figure out if maybe another antenna position would work better, Gene.
I...
In the meantime, we suggest that you turn those you have the guys in Charlie Brown turn their suit compressors off so we don't suck that stuff up into the suit loops.
Look, Joe; we got the screens over and it's been like this 3 days. We're all squared away.
Joe, we've got the screens o...
Charlie Brown, this is Houston. Say again, if you would, Tom.
I'll tell them, Tom.
Good.
We've got the screens over the exhaust hoses and we've been sucking out of the Command Module for 3 days cleaning the screens, so we're alright now. I've got good signal strength on both S-band forward and S-band aft antennas on the 1/4. You want me to switch over and give you a call again?
Roger; let's give it another try.
Okay, I'll give it another try. Tom, you want to turn my suit power off?
Okay, I've got a little bit of time here to...
Suit Power Off; babe.
There's Secchi.
Okay. We got about 2 minutes and 40 seconds to go.
Okay, babe; it's coming down.
Now, originally, when you told me to stop, I only pitched about 0.1 degree, and then you said "Increase it."
Yes, yes.
That what you want to do, start 0.1, and then...
Yes, that's the best way.
Okay, I'll hit you a 0.1 and when you tell me to go, I'll hit you faster.
Okay.
Here it comes.
Okay.
God damn, these things are hard to pick out.
Here's those five diamond ones.
Okay, you got the little five diamonds.
Yes.
[Garble], would You?
What?
Tell them I'm calling them.
Hello, Houston. This is Charlie Brown; Snoopy's been calling you and calling you. Do you read him?
Charlie Brown, this is Houston. We sure cannot. That's a negative receive on Snoopy there, Charlie Brown.
Negative, Gene-o. They don't read you.
Okay, you've got about a minute and a half.
Okay, I'm on it.
Okay.
Or was on it. Shit!
Are we going to pitch down?
No. Yes.
Now? Ready?
Yes, go ahead.
Let me know when you get the first mark.
I got the first one.
OK there's one.
7, 8, 9, 10...
Charlie Brown, this is Houston.
...12, 13, 14...
Stand by, we're in the middle of our landmark tracking.
...16, 17, 18, 19...
Roger, Charlie Brown, this is Houston. And Snoopy, also, if you're reading. What we're going to try and do is go over to the CDR side and set the switches up there, and see if we can get any voice comm over there. And we'll read off the switch...
...6, 7...
...list to you, Geno.
...8, 9...
OK, Snoopy. This is...
...10, 11...
...Houston. On the...
...12,13...
...panel 13, push in the...
...14, 15...
...Commander's Audio, and then, on--
...16, 17...
...the Commander's Audio panel...
...18, 19...
...Set your S-band T/R to T/R...
...20, 21...
VHF-A, T/R and...
...22, 23...
...VHF-B, Receive
...24, 25...
And on the LMP panel, go to Backup...
...26, 27...
...and let's try it.
...28, 29, 30. How fast are you pitching, T.P?
You want to pitch faster?
Yes. 1, 2...
I'll pitch a little faster for you.
...That's good, fine. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14...
You're counting slow.
...15, 16, 17, 18, 19...
Anytime babe.
...20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.
OK, that's four of them.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13...
Snoopy, this...
...14, 15...
...is Houston. If you're trying to give us a call...
...16...
...would you try that again, please? I think we're getting you real faint.
...17, 18, 19, 20, 21...
OK, Snoopy...
...22...
...this is Houston. You're booming in loud and clear now.
...23...
How do you read me?
--24, 25. 26, 27, 28, 29.
Mark another one when you got it.
Man, I'm on top of it!
You're loud and clear, Geno. Let's press on. I bet we can wipe this out in time. Go ahead with a long count - one long count in each mode, and give us an ident on - identify which mode you're in, Push To Talk, VOX, and so forth. OK?
Did you mark it, John?
Huh?
Did you mark it?
Not yet.
Ready for the last mark. Stand by.
Okay, I've been reading you.
Roger. Go.
Okay, go. That was it,.
What was [garble]?
Tell us what it was.
You're loud and clear, Push To Talk, Gene-o. Go ahead with ICS (intercommunication system).
Phew!
Loud and clear. Press on.
That ought to be real simple, John. You did it [garble].
No, that's nothing. That - that - the W-matrix has zeros in it.
Oh.
Loud and clear; press on.
Loud and clear; press on.
Okay, give me a long count in VOX, Gene-o. I think maybe the signal dropped out on one of them there.
Okay. That looks good, Gene-o. Let's press on. Configure for Omni Voice PCM, step 1, activation 14.
Okay.
Roger that.
Okay, John.
Okay, and stand by until we get set up here. I'll give you a call.
Okay, Houston. I think I was tracking F-1 and B-l, there. You want to stop it, or go wherever you want to go?
Well, I'm going to go straight to that attitude, old buddy. I got you going, and you should he coming down to (pitch) 208, yaw zero, and roll 315.
Those things are easy to track once you find them. The problem is finding them, as usual. In - in F-1 Hell, that's such a big-ass crater; I - I didn't even know what to track on it, so I tracked the right edge of it. It's a great big - that's a damn crater, that was like - I put the sextant in it; I was down in that hole about 300 - it was terrible.
Snoopy, this is Houston on Omni Voice PM. How do you read?
Okay, the first part of your transmission didn't come through, Snoopy; but give me a long count on this if you would.
Roger, go ahead.
You finished it? Are you in an attitude that I can get? Is that where we're supposed to be? Okay.
Okay, Snoopy. This is Houston. We're reading you now, Gene-o...
[Garble]. Okay, Joe. Do you read me now?
Roger. Reading you now, Gene-o. And...
[Garble]. You were because I suppose I'm in hot mike in this configuration.
Roger. That's affirmative.
And, Charlie Brown, if you can...
Okay. Let's press on. I'm ready to go on.
Okay. We're going to stand by until we verify Charlie Brown here: that he's in his landmark tracking or sleep attitude.
He is. I just got word from him.
Very good. Okay. Let's press on with steerable voice PM (phase modulation).
Hear that? Get - Okay. Steerable-voice PM.
[Garble].
Here goes that antenna, So stand by.
Okay.
Charlie Brown, this is Houston. While we're waiting here we'd like for you to turn H2 tank 1 heaters to Auto and H2 tank 2 heaters to Off, please.
Snoopy, this is Houston. Standing by.
Roger. Houston, do you read?
Hey! Got you loud and clear, Gene-o. We should be ready to press on now, and give me a long count in each of your three modes again.
Houston, Charlie Brown, with a High Gain S-band. How do you read?
Okay. Not yet, Joe. Wait until I get this thing locked up on Auto. I'm only on Slew. John, on my mistake. He's got about another 10 seconds to maneuver.
Okay. Houston. We copy.
What's AOS - I mean, LOS time, Joe?
We've got about 33 more minutes, Snoopy.
Okay. We'll make it.
Roger that. And Charlie Brown, we'd like to have your H2 tank 1 heaters to Auto, H2 tank 2 heaters Off. Do you copy?
Roger. That's what we did. Over.
Okay. Thank you much.
How soon?
Okay, Houston. I've got you locked up in Auto. How are you reading?
Snoopy, this is Houston. I'm reading you loud and clear, Gene-o. A long count in each mode and identify which mode you're in, please.
Okay. I'm in PTT, and instead of a long count, I'll tell you I'm reading a signal strength of 4.2 locked up in S-band Auto. And I guess, I'm not sure but it might lock up anywhere from about 3.2 to 3.6. This time I was at 3.8 and ended up locking up solid here at 4.2, and I'm going ICS at PTT.
Roger that. You're loud and clear.
Okay. How do you read me now? I'll give you a long count, and I'm going to unkey it to see whether I've got a hot mike, and then I'll pick it up again. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2 - 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. How do you read me?
Okay, you're loud and clear, Gene-o, on push-to-talk. Go ahead with VOX (voice operated transmission).
Okay. I'm in VOX, and what I really want to know was I - I unkeyed about halfway through the ICS PTT mode to see whether I had a hot mike. I assume I did not. Is that correct?
That's a verify.
Okay. And I'm in VOX, and you're reading me loud and clear, I guess.
That's affirmative, Snoopy. We're reading you loud and clear, and stand by this one. We'll see if we're ready to go on here with the data.
Okay. I'm standing by, and I tell you, when that S-hand antenna moves around, you'd think that the whole house was coming down on you.
(Laughing) Roger. We copy. Charlie Brown. wed like to update your state vector, if you'd give us ACCEPT, please.
You got it. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
What happened? Did that last thing get transferred from the landmark tracking? Over.
[Garble] Joe. So far, so good.
Roger. That's affirmative. And Snoopy, we can proceed on to the FM mode now.
Okay. I'm going FM and I'll give you a call. If I don't hear back from you in 30 seconds, I'll switch back to PM.
Negative. Stand by in the FM mode, Gene-o. Let me give you a call. You should be able to read me, and if we don't catch you - If we can't read you, I'll give you another mode to go to.
Okay. Fine, Joe, I'm in FM right now.
Okay. We'll be with you in just a minute.
Okay, Snoopy, this is Houston. I'm ready to listen to you now. How about some good numbers?
[Garble] at all. Hello, Houston, do you read me FM?
Okay, Snoopy. This is Houston. Roger. I'm reading you on FM now.
Okay. You're coming through loud and clear.
Okay. Let's double check, Gene-o. You're not in the DownVoice Backup, are you?
That's affirmative. I am in DownVoice Backup. Let me go to Voice.
Roger that.
Okay, Snoopy. This is Houston. We're standing by for a call in FM mode. Would you try one more time, please?
Hello, Houston. This is Charlie Brown. Do you read Snoopy?
Charlie Brown, negative. We're not reading him, although we're still trying to acquire some data in this mode, Tom. In the meantime, you can have your computer back.
Okay, we're in ... Joe.
Roger that, Tom.
Houston, Charlie Brown is set up for the LM relay test.
Roger. Charlie Brown, this is Houston. We're not quite ready for that yet. We'll be with you in just a minute on that. We've got to try this PM mode yet, John.
Snoopy, this is Houston. Still on FM mode. How do you read?
I'm reading you loud and clear. Do you read me?
Roger. I sure am. You're not in DownVoice Backup, are you?
Negative. I'm in voice in FM.
Oh, you're clear as a bell. How about a little short count there to confirm all the disbelievers here, Gene-o?
I'll give you a short count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. You're coming in loud and clear, Joe; as clear as any other way I've heard you.
Roger. This is the clearest we've had. Are you in push-to-talk mode?
That's affirm. Push-to-talk. I'll give you a short count in ICS PTT. This ICS PTT: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. How do you read now?
Boy, you're loud and clear. How about one quick one on VOX, and we'll press on.
Okay. I got you on VOX: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. How do you read?
Very good. Stand by one. I think we'll press on here. Okay, Snoopy. This is Houston. That's loud and clear. Let's press on with the PM mode and then to backup voice test, step 1.
Okay. I'm in PM mode, and I can hear Chris (Chris Kraft) back there talking in the background, so it must be pretty good.
(Laughing) Roger. We copy, Gene-o. Stand by.
Okay, Goldstone, this is CapCom.
[Garble] Baby, he's got the strongest S-band I've ever heard.
That's pretty good.
How we coming down there, Joseph?
Well, we're trying to lock up, Snoopy. We'll give you a call here when we get it.
Okay, Snoopy. This is Houston. We're not able to lock up down here, I wonder if you'd confirm that you've gone through that step 1 backup voice test.
[Garble].
Hello, Houston, Houston. This is Snoopy. Are you reading?
Roger. Reading you Snoopy, Go ahead.
Tom, give me a [garble] try and take some [garble] in this
Hello, Houston. Charlie Brown.
Go ahead, Charlie Brown. Houston.
Look, I don't know how it sounds to you down there, Joe, but it sounds like things are kind of loose on this total comm situation. Over.
Roger. Tom, we're unable to get a lockup right now. We'd like to verify that step 1 on that backup voice - correction - step 1 on the - yes -backup voice test has been accomplished.
Say again.
Roger. We'd like to confirm that step 1 on the backup voice test has been done.
Is that where they are?
That's affirmative.
Hello, Houston, Houston. Are you reading Snoopy on the backup voice test? Over.
Snoopy, this is Houston. Roger, Gene-o. We got you now, and stand by and we'll get...
Charlie Brown, this is Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Charlie Brown.
Roger, Charlie. I think we've got you in the relay mode. I wonder if we could have you come out of that relay mode for now?
Okay. I'll go ahead and turn off the VHF.
Okay. You think we're still in it now?
Stand by and I'll see.
Okay, Snoopy. This is Houston. Let's try it again now.
Okay, Houston. This is Snoopy. How are you reading now? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1?
Okay. I'm reading you loud and clear, Snoopy, but I think we're still in the relay mode.
Well, I'm down to about 27 volts, 27.2, now, so let's keep going if we can. Let's get Charlie Brown out of the relay mode, then,
Charlie Brown this is Houston. Could you verify that you're not in relay mode, please?
We're not in relay mode, please.
[Laughing.] Okay. Thanks.
Okay, Snoopy. This is Houston. Let's proceed on with step 3.
Roger. Step 3.
Okay, Snoopy and Charlie Brown. This is Houston. Let's press on to the LM relay test, and verify when you're ready to go.
This is Snoopy. I'm ready to go, if you're reading me.
Roger. Reading you, Snoopy. How about you, Charlie Brown?
Charlie Brown, this is Houston. How do you read?
Hello, Charlie Brown. This is Houston. How do you read?
Snoopy, this is Houston. You still reading me okay, Gene-o?
Yes. I'm reading you, Joe.
(Laughing) Okay, Gene-o.
Houston, this is Charlie Brown. We're reading you about four-by-four. Over.
Okay, Charlie Brown. Fine. How about giving me a short count, Tom?
Roger. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Okay, Tom. I'm reading you loud and clear. Stand by one, please.
Hey, hang on. That doesn't count.
Okay. Snoopy and Charlie Brown. That ought to terminate these things. Let's go back to basic comm mode now and verify it, please.
Hey, Houston, I never - I never got to the LM relay test. I've just been waiting for your Go.
Roger that. We're going to terminate that, Gene-o, and we'll pick that up later. We want to go back to basic comm now.
You were cut out by Charlie Brown. Say again.
Okay. We verify we're not going to check that right now, Gene-o. We want to go back to the basic comm mode.
Okay. Stand by a minute.
Roger that.
Roger. And Command Module...
Okay, Joe. How are you reading me?
Okay, Snoopy. This is Houston. Reading you five-by.
Okay. I'm reading you loud and clear.
Roger that.
We've got about 8 minutes until LOS, Gene-o. We'll have some stuff to send up to you here in just a minute.
Okay. I'll give you all the LM data when I get back home - up in the Command Module up there, or down there, wherever the cause may be - on voltages and all that other jazz.
Okay. That'll be fine. How does the Glycol Temp look?
The Glycol Temp has been sitting on zero since I got in here. I haven't been able to get it to read at all.
Okay. We copy.
I don't know who makes the bearings for that S-band antenna, but I'm sure glad they're not in my car.
[Laughing.] We copy.
Hello, Snoopy. Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. This is Snoop.
Roger. A couple of things we need to check Gene. We're showing your AGS deadband switch in the Max position. Would you verify Min and cycle it to the Min position?
Okay, Ed. It is in Min, and I'll cycle it from Max to - back to Min.
Roger.
It's in Max now, and I'll bring it back to Min again.
Okay. It's back in Min.
Okay, The ascent oxidizer is reading 17 psi high on the ground. We'd like for you to read - read that out for us, and in order to do so, on panel 16 row 1 display engine override circuit breaker On and your Prop Temp monitor to Ascent and give us a reading, please.
Which ascent pressure was that? Helium pressure or Reg pressure?
Oxidizer pressure, please.
Okay. Oxidizer pressure looks like it's about 180 psi.
Okay, Snoopy. If you will pull that circuit breaker again, please.
Okay, Ed. It's out. By the way, everything in the LM was just as we launched with it, after I thoroughly checked the configuration.
Roger. Roger, Snoopy. Stand by one, please.
Snoopy, this is Houston. We're through with you for today. The comm we're going - comm relay tests will go by the board for the moment. You can proceed with the rest of your housekeeping and close out.
Okay, Ed. Fine. Everything is looking good in here. I didn't mean to be so impatient. I just wanted to get this thing over before we lost you, and I also didn't want to use too much power on this bird. Comm tests I guess are always that way, but they sounded pretty good from this end, if you're all satisfied on the primary mode.
Roger. What we heard was good; what we didn't hear was obviously - obvious that we didnt hear it.
Okay. Fine. I'll be closing out the LM and finishing housekeeping, and see you next door.
Charlie Brown, Houston.
Charlie Brown. Houston.
Hello. Charlie Brown, Houston.
Charlie Brown, Houston.
Snoopy, Houston.
Charlie Brown, Houston.
See what that - see what that Master Alarm is, Tom.
Let me get up there and look down for a minute. O2 Flow High?
Yes.
Charlie Brown, Houston.
Hello, Houston; Charlie Brown. Hello, Houston, Charlie Brown.
Charlie Brown, Houston, transmitting in the blind. We show an O2 Flow High light. We'd like you to select your B/D Roll in the DAP. And on the - the hatch, we could - we tested out the flight tape, and we'd like you to use the flight tape to tape over the Mylar. The tape will stick to the Mylar and the hatch rim, but will not stick to the RTV or the fiber glass, so you'll have to bridge the gap, and just tape it over to - over the Mylar. For a cleanup, we suggest you use a - the first choice - that you use a wet terrycloth and go out to the RTV and fiber glass with that. The other suggestions, that - if that doesn't work next time around, we'll suggest for cleaning up. Over.
Snoopy. Houston.
I think we've lost them, Tom.
[Garble] Houston, Charlie Brown. How do you read, babe? [Garble] that's it. Guess I'd better go to [garble].
Yes.
In the Wide Beam.
[Garble] I don't know whether you go to Wide Beam or not.
[Garble] any idea why that flow [Garble]?
Maybe it's just because you got these holes all clogged up.
Probably.
[Garble].
If I had a longer hose, I'd be trying to get these [garble].
Yes, I've got to close this hatch, didn't I?
Yes.
Pardon me?
Yes, you ain't never closed it?
Close what?
What'd you say?
Should we get to the pressure - Yes, let's get the pressure while we're taking them out here. Or do you want to take them out and check the whole thing? Let's see, I've got to [garble].
[Garble] don't fit in. [Garble]. The LM [garble] pressure [garble] pressure. Okay, babe; I'm reading 5800 pounds. [Garble]. [The nominal OPS oxygen pressure should be 5,880 ± 500 psig.]
[Garble] locked. O2 valve open? You've got to take them off of this thing, don't you? [Cough.] [Garble] get in there and read that pressure, You've got a pen around here someplace, don't you, Gene-o?
OK.
Heater test button Got to be in here.
[Garble].
Aren't these lights supposed to go on when you push the test button?
[Garble].
Okay, they don't.
Hey, John.
Yes.
Take back the power.
Take back the power.
Yes, give me back CSM power.
Okay, there it comes.
OK, you got it.
I got it.
These lights don't work on my - they do not work.
Cabin Repress valve. Stand by.
Hold it. Hold it. John?
What?
Let's wait to do that until last. What do you think?
What are you going to do?
This freaking heater light test doesn't work worth a...
what are you going to do, there...
We're going to close the light...
Close what light?
No, but - We'll do this the last thing . It goes off like a shotgun.
Why are you going to do that? Is there any danger of leaking air out when it does it?
I don't know. It gives it a good zap of air.
Into what?
Into the cabin.
What does it call?
Huh?
Why?
No. My heater doesn't work - that's nice. OK, this - we got oxygen.
PLSS pressure still reads 5,800. Yes.
OK, let me check the other one.
Cough.
Whew! Oh! Son of a bitch! Shit! Gene-o?
You're upside down.
Yes? Looks right-side up to me, the way it was starred in there. Didn't stir. Huh? Nothing. It might be the last of that pressure decaying off in there. Hell, I wouldn't - Gene-o? Son of a bitch. Now.
Please don't open any hatches while you guys are dicking around up there.
How do you get this thing? Okay. I'll hold in there. You want me to get - let me get up in there. I've only got a certain length of hose, here.
Wait a minute.
Come on; I'll hold the hatch up for you, babe. Wait just a minute until I get upside down in here. Oh!
Been doing?
Huh?
What you been doing?
Checking out the PLSS. He still got an O2 Flow High? What...
No, I think it's going down now. Yes. Down to 0.6.
Let me get over here and help Gene-o. Here's that roll of tape, babe.
Yes, I just was using - I just used it.
Okay, I got the hatch.
Oh, what the shit.
What? Yes. What? Okay.
[Garble]?
Yes, I had 5,800 pounds. How are you doing on yours?
How are you doing, Gene-o? Huh?
Huh? You don't get a heater light on, either, huh? Phew!
No heater light, huh? What, Gene-o?
Well, Mattingly recommended that you take the things off. Okay. Still pisses me off.
[Garble].
That's what I did. I actuated it and pushed the button.
[Garble].
Yes, because I tried it one time and it didn't, and I tried it again. Screw it; let it go. That else we got to check down there?
Okay. Did you get the cards put up, Gene-o?
[Garble].
Okay. Okay. Wait - We'll tell José about this.
What?
José, you'd better stand by for a bang.
Jesus Christ!
[Laughter.] Watch the hatch; it's coming shut. Where in the hell we keep Geno's hoses?
[Garble] on Gene-o's side. What was that? Why don't you all come back in here and let me close that door?
[Laughter.]
We'll jettison that on the next rev.
Yes, we're so far away from a space station [laughter] any permanent thing.
You ain't shitting there. Is this a nickel and dime operation? Huh? Wasn't that a Mickey Mouse thing they ran through there, today?
No?
Huh?
Ready to come out, Gene-o? Let me get this -
Come on back, Gene-o. Don't lean on those windows. You do good work.
My freaking head is about ready to come off my shoulders.
Take a couple of aspirin.
Oh, boy, do I need them.
We're all set down there?
You guys are upside down.
I feel like I'm upside down, to tell you the truth, right at this point in time.
It's like another world, getting down in there. It's like a big house or something.
It's really nice down here.
Got a lot of room.
OK, now; as soon as you guys get back in, I'm going to close the hatch.
[Garble] the lights [garble] go out.
OK.
See what?
The lights go out when he closes that switch.
Do they?
Where is he? What - Gene-o!
(Laughter) Did the lights go out? Huh? Push the button - there's a button right there.
They're alright.
Who gives a shit! Come on back in here.
[Garble].
You got the hatch locked?
Okay, I guess; what goes in next, the drogue?
I don't care. Do you want to put some of that -do you want to put it back in there?
I'll put the drogue in, babe.
Huh?
Here, take that bag full of shit I've collected.
I - you don't put it in. I put it in.
You put it in? Okay.
You keep - you got to be in the LM when you're doing it. If you want me to do it, I'll be glad to. Let me do it.
Okay.
There you go.
Well, John, I don't see a scratch on this son of a bitch. You really goosed that thing in there, babe. You know that?
Well, I was aiming for the - the nozzle. Isn't this great? Isn't this great?
There isn't a scratch on it, is there.
No.
Yes, there's one there.
You see one?
The one I - one there. Those could have been done by the thing. One there. Those are - the kind of scratches that are on there wouldn't be done by the drogue.
No.
[Garble] comm work?
Well, occasionally , it sounded like you were coming in loud and clear to them. That S-band strength looked great once you had it - Can I help you, .John?
No, I hope not. Are you going to do it all tomorrow?
No.
Oh, shit. Just a little screwed up, is all
Why don't you take some of them right away, huh, babe? You want one right away?
[Garble].
Got it locked?
Yes.
Do you want the drogue- next?
Might as well. It won't take very long to do that.
You want the head of it first?
Huh?
It's caught on that urine thing. Can't afford to bust our urine hose, you guys. God damn it, I was going to take them optics down.
Yes but...
Well, I think I'd better take it down.
Yes, right. Take it down. Get that hose out of the way. Let me go back and get it down in there, babe.
Boy, a 97-pound weakling can do - can work this damn thing. Look at it.
How about that. You know something, you guys?
What?
The drogue punches a hole in your goddamn front hatch.
Huh?
Look, there's a hole in the hatch. Not a hole, but a spot where the drogue has hit it. That's what I call a tight fit.
Oh, shit.
Do you want me to read that to you, babe?
No, I don't think.
You turn it around where the guide goes with that yellow stripe, right?
Yes.
There you go.
Got a little problem here of some kind.
The thing is in would you believe that?
Yes.
Okay. Capture Latch Release handle. Okay, clock, clockwise to Lock position. Do not force. Push to reset. Go? Verify Capture Latches engaged.
Does the drogue stay in there that loose?
Huh?
Does the drogue stay in there that loose?
Yes. Yes. See, it's locked. It's loose. Well, it won't be loose when I finish with this.
Oh.
Okay, installation strut. Pull - push - unstow to full extension. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Christ, that ain't hardly enough. All that was in there. Screw it, that's all we'll do it.
Okay. Are you ready for the big hatch?
Okay. Yes. Let me do it, though. I want to see the problems involved in manhandling that son of a gun, because I'll have to do it by myself tomorrow.
Watch your optics.
Oh, yes. Well, I'd better take them down for that.
You can get the...
What I'd really better do is clean this seal God damn it I This thing works like a charm hatch - this probe, so far. You know?
Tom, while you're down there [garble] tomorrow [garble]?
God! My ratchet fall indicator flush?
In fact, if John wants to take any Hasselblad pictures tomorrow, he should take this instead of the 250, Gene-o.
I want to use the 80. Yes; well, I'll use whichever one you give me.
I think that 80 would be better for you, The way he's going to be in the stationkeeping. Gene-o?
Huh?
Put the 80 (mm) on. Put the 250 (mm) back there. You can put it back in here and...
What we need is a few more pieces of gear.
Stow that thing.
Bastards stuck that shit all over the hatch.
We'll help you here with these...
I ain't hit them optics. I don't really think I they're involved.
[Garble].
Want to clean that - teeth off.
Hey, this son of a bitch; it weighs 84 pounds, and here I am holding it like it's a baby.
Yes. Get this stuff out of the way for you, John. There you go, babe.
Look at that. Look at that. Look at that shit, would you? Boy, would you ever play hell doing that one g.
You lined up?
Yes.
Really incredible.
That's all there is to it.
We're locked up in our own little home. Let's get something to eat and get to bed and get this thing, straightened up for tomorrow. Shit. How's everybody feel? Like we're all set to go?
Yes. If you can make the comm work, I'm all for it.
Okay, now let's make this sure that we're on LM Delta-P.
[Garble].
On LM Press, I mean, excuse me.
[Garble].
It should go over there where it belongs. We've got to be on LM Press tonight, you guys. Does that sound right? We're going to be on LM Press tonight. That sound right?
You mean keep the LM pressurized?
Yes.
Yes. But don't be blowing that stuff through that hatch, huh? That's the way it's supposed to be, anyway.
Well, now it's away, men.
Okay, take these hoses here. Is this your hose, Gene-o? This big long one? Is it the big long ugly hose? Belongs to Gene-o? Gene-o Pizza?
[Garble].
Yes, this says "Right." This is your hose.
[Garble] somewhere. Does it go on the inside of here?
No, it goes right through there .
It goes right, in through, there.
How you feel after that shit? Huh?
My eyes are bothering me.
It just hurts, huh?
Yes, I got a headache.
I think that's partially two things: your eyes and your sinuses. My guess.
My head's a little stuffy from being down there, and yours should be a hell of a lot worse. (Cough)
Take some water and rub it across your face. That'll make you feel a little better.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Tom.
Yes.
I can't tell what the hell I'm doing, if anything.
Man, it do feel good to be back in Charlie Brown, doesn't it?
I was a little worried about that thing.
Why don't we get a dump bag?
[Garble].
Not a thing. Eat and go to sleep.
Dump bag?
Get a dump bag, and get food set up for breakfast and - get it all set up...
[Garble] this is there [garble].
We got to get up in about 10 hours. Shit, we did it on time with all that other stuff.
We did?
Yes. We started late. We haven't set up for the breakfast. Why don't you let me pull this stuff down? Oops. What the hell was that?
What's what?
Somebody piss on the floor, there?
Oh.
You think we had some water when we made the SPS burn? Would you believe?
We what?
We may have had some water down here when we made the SPS burn. Oh, yes; I'd say we had some water down here when we made the freaking SPS burn, or somebody had pissed all over the floor. That ain't piss; that's water babe...still had big puddles of it.
Yes.
This condensation [garble]. Here's where it came from, babe; right here.
Yes.
Right out of the ECU. I guess the utility bags soaked it all up.
I guess.
Well, you want to get out some underwear and change this shit out and get some chow?
Yes.
Why don't we put the Flight Plan back over here? Gene-o, what do you want to eat? You want to eat a wet-pack thing?
What time is AOS? Shouldn't we be talking to them guys?
We've got - 3 more minutes.
Okay.
Oh, babe you want to use the - you want to use this temporary hatch stowage bag for the big shitcan, huh?
Yes.
I'm with you, babe. [Laughter.] We got a place to put it. Do you want - Are you going to put the hatch in here tomorrow?
I'll tell you what, babe. Look - What about taking my - my bag here, and filling it full of food and stuff like that, huh?
Okay.
All your empty food stuff, your puke stuff you had, Gene-o, and all that.
You want to take it over to the LM with you?
Well, what you can do is put it in here when we finish, huh? We can put this in there.
OK.
Well, actually, I'm afraid to open it; do we have another one?
I'm afraid to - to open it, too.
[Garble].
Let's take that over, and we'll take this, too.
[Garble].
Where's your bag, babe? I'm going to put all this stuff in it and start making dinner.
What bag?
Gene-o has a bag. Let's start eating all our food and all this, stuff squared away.
What meal are we coming up to?
[Garble].
Yes. This is all garbage.
What's the next meal we've got, José? Anybody got any idea?
[Garble].
I don't know?
[Garble] spend the night in my food.
Doesn't it tell you to put the H2 fan on Auto or something?
Yes.
Yes, yes.
Tell him to do all that shit.
You want us to cycle the other one [garble]?
I don't know.
It said turn one off, and put the other one on Auto. It didn't say nothing about cycling any others.
[Garble].
Shoot, you already got the thing full, Tom; and we ain't started.
I'm still cramming , babe.
You want - Turn the tunnel lights off. There you go.
See the horizon from the [garble].
Oh, shit!
Don't feel bad about that.
What time do we take these Auto optics out of that [garble]?
I've got it written up there.
What time we took it off?
82:29:20; I put it in the Flight Plan when we - that's what...
That's when we put it on.
Yes; OK.
[Garble] take it off [garble] about 15 minutes ago.
Yes.
Shoot, look at that thing. Shoot.
One bag ain't going to be enough , Tom.
No. Let's try to tie these two bags together, since we got - this has got all that insulation in it. We'll get rid of that. We got any more of these bags?
[Garble] one more.
Yes, there's another one around here, somewhere. Excuse me, Gene-o.
(Cough) Hello, Houston; this is Apollo 10.
Hello, Houston...
Apollo 10, this Is Houston. We're standing by.
Apollo 10, Houston.
Hello, Houston. Houston, this is, Apollo 10, calling from the Moon. Do you read?
Hello, Houston. Houston, this is Apollo 10. How do you read?
Roger, 10. This is Houston. Reading you loud and clear now, John. How me?
Apollo 10, Houston. Apollo 10, Houston. How go you read now?
Hey, down there, Houston. Do you read Apollo 10 from the Moon?
Apollo 10, Apollo 10, from the Moon. This is Houston. Roger. We're reading you loud and. clear, John. How are you doing now?
This ain't John. This is the fellow that came back from Snoopy, back in Charlie Brown.
Hey! Okay there, fellow. How about the snow situation? Have you got any in the Command Module, Gene?
Would you believe we've been living in what you might call snow for 3 days? And, we found out where the rest of it is. It's in our good friend Snoopy. But, however, I think if we look at the cabin dump valves and hatch real good, which we've done once, and we look at them again tomorrow, when we close it we will be all right. Okay?
Okay, That sounds pretty good. Evidently it isn't bothering you too much, as far as inhaling it, or getting it in your nostrils or your mouth. Is that affirmative?
Yes. I didn't have to worry about inhaling it. I ate my way through.
Okay.
Your throat feels a little lousy, and your nose wheezes a little bit.
That should be a space first: snow on the Moon. Hey, I've got lots of things for you to copy if you've got a pencil.
Ive got a pencil. You go ahead, Gene-o. Before you start going, I wonder if we could have P00 and Accept.
The LM went off at 82:29:20, CSM power to LM came back on at 84:32:00. CSM onboard readout: Batt C, 37 volts; Pyro Batt A, 37; Pyro Batt B, 37; RCS A 81, Bravo 87, Charlie 84, and Delta 84. We have cycled the H2, O2 fans and we still have H2 fan number 1 in Auto. I have initiated battery B charge at the present time, and now I have some very interesting news from Snoopy, If you'll stand by one.
Okay. We'll stand by. We would like for you to go to P00 and Accept. We've got an update state vector for you.
Okay. I'll go to P00 and Accept. Stand by. Okay, Houston. You, P00 and Accept.
Roger that.
And I have some news from Snoopy. He's a pretty good fellow, by the way.
Good to hear that.
Okay. I think you've got the roll CAL angle of minus 0.1; that's pretty close to zero. That's just off of zero, and that's as close as I can read it.
Okay. That's minus 1 or minus 0.1.
Minus 0.1.
Roger that.
My docking pilot has a good eyeball. The normal Rad level in the - in Snoopy is 0.001 Rad per hour.
Okay. We copy.
Snoopy was found to be sleeping during the whole 3 days of our translunar journey and was exactly the way we put him to sleep when we left the pad. There were no switches, or breakers, or anything misplaced.
Okay. We copy that.
Okay. When I looked at the EPS system, I found out that battery 1 had 35 volts; batteries 2, 3, and 4 also have 35 volts. Battery 5 and battery 6 had 37 volts. Commander's bus had 29.2 volts when I powered up, and system engineers was reading 29.0, and those were all on low tap.
Okay. we copy.
Okay. My AC bus voltage was on the high side of the Green for inverter number 2.
Okay.
Okay. When I deactivated the comm and shut down APS, battery 1, 2, 3, and 4 had 37.8 volts. I don't know how that's possible, unless I misread it. And the commander's bus and the LM's bus are at 72.2.
Okay. We understand.
That's not possible, is it?
Roger. Everybody's shaking their head yes, Ed.
The name's Gene, Joe.
Okay, Bill,
Okay. The OPS - The OPS's both had 5,800 pounds on them and checked out okay. The LM housekeeping is done. I think it's in good shape. If you want to know the truth, after my initial faux pas on that Downvoice Backup switch, I think the comm came out pretty good. In spite of the fact that the S-band antenna shakes the LM around when it moves, it really held lock at about 4.2 on the meter. I'm not sure exactly whether it will lock out automatically below 3.6, but it'll probably be worth the try tomorrow.
Okay. We verify on that, Gene. We've got some good words for you on the comm too. It's particularly on the Omni. We're a lot more satisfied than anybody expected. We got a lot - real good voice comm with you on Omni. In fact, you're coming down on normal voice, loud and clear. We're not going to have to go on backup on that mode.
Oh, that's very good. That means that - Oh, that's very good. Hey, there's one other thing, Joe. I noticed that before you asked me, then I went ahead and proceeded. I never did get an indication on the glycol temperature. It was down at Off-Scale Low the whole time.
Okay. We copy that.
And I think the same guy who supplied the bearings for the S-band antenna supplied them for the glycol pump.
Okay. I'll check into that.
But other than that, I'm real happy. There's no disorientation when you go down there. As a matter of fact, it's a lot more comfortable down there - or up there, I don't know which - but it's a lot more comfortable over there than it is in here, as far as being able to know what's up and what's down.
Okay. Understand. Let's see...
You get some reports from Snoopy today, I hope we - Go ahead, Joe.
Okay. I was just going to tell you, go ahead and go to Block on - You can have that computer back now.
Okay. We're in Block. And that's our report from Snoopy today. I'm personally very happy with the fellow, and I hope we can give you as good a report tomorrow.
You bet your life. Let's see, we've got a couple other items here on the Command Module. We'd like for you to zero the optics. And, let me see. We'd like to have the LM - the Command Module Delta-P readout if you could. Yes this is before the prior to ingress, there.
Okay. I'll get the...
[Garble]. Prior to ingress, it was 1.9.
1.9. Thank you.
1.9, prior to ingress. But prior to pressurization - When we pressurized it, it was zero.
Roger. Understand, John. Thanks.
Okay. Now, we're on the vent right now. We're going to keep that thing pumped up so tomorrow, it won't be agonizingly slow.
(Laughter) Okay.
You got anything else for us right at the moment, Joe? If not, we're going to hustle around here and get prepared for tomorrow and eat something and do those other things. But while those other two guys are down there, I'll really be willing to do anything I can, I guess.
Okay, Charlie Brown - Apollo 10. Stand by for a minute. We've got a couple or three items we're discussing now.
Okay, Ed.
Okay. Apollo 10, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Tom. We've got a few items we'd like for you to check here. First off, we'd like to verify the positions of the H2 tank heaters. We want number 1 to Auto and number 2 to Off. We'd like to verify that with you.
Okay. We've got number 1 H2 tank heater Auto, and number 2 is now Off.
Okay. And we'd like Direct...
And we're reversed.
Okay. Thank you. And Direct Power Off for number 2 hand controller, please.
Okay. That's done.
And, just prior to LOS this last pass, we were showing an O2 Flow High indication. Did you have that in the cockpit? And if so, do you have any good words on that?
Yes. O2 Flow High is caused because the inflow valve gets all clogged with insulation. Also, the intake to the hoses.
You know, we've been cleaning all these exhaust hoses and the intake to the inflow valve off a couple or three times a day.
Okay. I understand.
But during LM ingress - During LM ingress, the flow of Mylar overcame the flow of cleaning off the hoses.
Okay. I understand.
Apollo 10, Houston. I've got a maneuver PAD I'll send up to you whenever you're ready to copy.
Okay, Joe. One more second.
Okay, Houston. I'm ready.
Okey doke, 10. This is for TEI-10, SPS/G&N: your time is 096 02 4054, plus 29966, minus 01794, plus 01605; roll is NA; pitch 054; all else is NA. I'll stand by for your readback.
Okay, Joe. TEI-10, SPS/G&N: starting with NOUN 33 096 02 4054, plus 29966, minus 01794, plus 01605; roll is NA, and pitch 054; and the rest is NA.
Okay. On your Noun 33, your seconds is 40.54.
Im sorry. That's what I've got written down. 096 02 4054.
Roger that.
Okay, Gene-o. Now we've got some words for you on this PUGS. It looks like you've got an engine that burns fuel rich, and what we're recommending is on the next burn, for you just to go to Full Increase, and leave it in Full Increase for the entire burn. You've got no fuel depletion problem, so just leave it in Full Increase.
Okay. Fine. I'm hoping that next burn with the SPS is a big one.
Yes. [Laughter.] And, 10, this is Houston. We've got some discussion words for you on this stuff that's floating around in the cockpit. It looks like the first thing, when you get that hatch open next time, will be to try and take some of that tape and tape over any holes that you can see. Does it look like - What looks like damage to the Mylar there, does it look like it was torn, or somebody punched a hole in it, or just what?
It looked like high-velocity oxygen ripped it apart. It's the insulation from underneath the - I guess aluminium covering - is what's come out in crumbs and snowflakes, and that's what's around. We've taped it up best we can, so that no more comes out and it's there, Babe, and I just think we can live with it, that's all, as long as we watch the dump valve and the hatch.
Roger. Okay. Well, listen, if it's floating around a good bit, Gene, there are several ideas that you've probably already thought of to clean it up. We've found that the stuff adheres pretty well to anything that's saturated with water. Take either a Kleenex or those towels that you've got. Soak them up with water on the food board - the water gun would be better even - and you can - you can kind of mop the stuff up with that, if you can catch it and then trap it. And one other thing that you might think about doing, is placing one of your towels - one of your terrycloth towels over the cabin inlet fan, or the inlet to the cabin fan, and turning the cabin fans on, and this will act as a filter and should trap most of it.
Okay, Joe. Thank you. I think our major problem in the Command Module is solved. We've got most all of that over the last 3 days. It's the LM where most of it is right now. I understand you're still saying the same thing on the cabin fans and the LM, huh?
It'll be a little harder to get to the inlet, or intake on that fan in the LM, Gene. You can try it if you think it's worth it.
No. I don't really, Joe. I think the big problem is solve it for the next flight. I think, we can handle it as long as we keep that hatch clean.
Okay.
It can't hurt us - It can't hurt us no more to breathe it anymore.
Roger.
One other little item. I forgot about Snoopy.
Okay. Go.
I didn't - I didn't get a chance to drink much of the water, but I took about eight or 10 big, good gulps, and I got about four good gulps of air.
Okay. We copy.
Okay, 10. Houston again. In order to - to reduce primary loop temperature during your sleep period, we'd like to power down Oh, we got three attitudes we'd like for you to power down. On panel 7, we'd like the SPS electronics power switch to ECA. And on panel 100, we'd like G&N power optics Off. And, up there on panel 2, we'd like the old...
Wait - Wait a minute.
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Now, that was on panel 7 you wanted what, Joe ?
Roger. SCS electronics power switch to ECA.
Okay. SCS electronics power to ECA?
Roger. That's affirmative.
Joe, come back with that one in about 5 minutes. We'll talk to you about it. There's some discussion about it up here.
Okay. How about the portable water heater of Off? That's on panel 2.
We'll do that for you. Okay. Potable water heater, thats Off.
Okay. G&N power optics Off on panel 100.
Okay. That's Off on panel 100, G&N power optics.
Okay. 10, Houston, here. One more thing. We'd like to nave the H2 fans 1 and 2 both Off, please.
Okay. They're Off, Joe, and I did cycle them just a little while ago, by the way.
Okay. Thank you.
How's the comm setup, Joe? We acquired you on Reacq, and looks like we're doing real fine right now. Reacq in Medium Beamwidth. Is that okay?
Roger. You're coming in real good, Gene.
Is that okay for sleep, then?
Stand by. We'll get a good readout on it.
Apollo 10, Houston, here. We've got two more items right now. First of all we'd like to verify you're going to make a canister change here before you go to bed. And, we'd like to have an O2 purge.
Okay. Ill verify. We will make the change and will give you the O2 purge right now...
...Roger.
...starting with 3.
You know, speaking of comm, Joe, I'm amazed. This is a quarter million miles away. Maybe half a million miles coming and going, and it's really outstanding.
Yes. We sure agree with that, Gene. We were really amazed at how clear you are coming in on voice on those Omnis.
I'll tell you one thing. It's a lot better than the simulator.
Okay.
Maybe we ought to have a relay station on the Moon so that the CMS can work with the LMS.
Yes. (Laughter) Agree there.
Okay, 10. This is Houston. Gene, we'd like for you to get up your antenna here in narrow beam and Reacq which will be your sleep confirmation. We can watch it until LOS, and make sure it's going to work out.
Okay. We acquired you in Reacq medium beam here this last time, and I just switched to narrow, so I assume it's going to work because we picked you up this last time on it.
Roger that.
Now you watch Snoopy well tonight, and make him sleep good, and we'll take him out for a walk and let him stretch his legs in the morning.
[Laughter.] Okay.
Houston, this is Charlie Brown.
Roger, Charlie. Go ahead.
Okay. We're going to let battery recharge all night, is that correct?
That's affirmative.
Okey doke.
And Charlie Brown, we'd like for you to disable B and C, and use B and D rolls in DAP, please.
You want us to use - Say Again, once more?
Okay. Disable Bravo and Charlie, and use Bravo and Delta roll in DAP.
Disable - Disable Bravo and Charlie, and use Bravo and Delta roll in the DAP.
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Apollo 10, Houston.
Go ahead. Houston, 10.
Hey! Okay, Tom. We'd like - First of all, I'd like for you to terminate purge on fuel cell 2 and start fuel cell 1 purge, if you would.
I'm sorry, Joe.
No sweat.
We're still trying to scramble around up here.
Okay. Listen, when you get time, I guess we'll get crew status. We'd like to get from you PRD readings and medication and all that sort of thing, and the chlorinations and all that. Whenever you get a chance, or whenever you want to call that down, press on. And that'll be about it for tonight, then.
Hello, Houston. This is Charlie Brown.
Hi, Charlie Brown. Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. The PDR readings: The CDR, 26036, the CMP 05036, and the LMP is 15038.
Okay. We copied all that.
The CDR ain't had nothing, and the CMP ain't had nothing, and the LMP had two aspirins about 30 minutes ago.
Okay.
I took those two because my athlete's feet were bothering me.
Okay. We copy that.
And, I'm sure much to your joy, I might go off the air for a while and turn it over to my partners in crime.
Okay. The man on the left says that sounds like the proper medication on that: one for each foot.
Oh? Only one foot was bothering me. I didn't know I'd only have to take one. I'll see you later.
Okay. Let's see. I guess - Are you still purging fuel cell 1 there, Gene? We can't monitor that down here.
Apollo 10, Houston.
GO, Houston.
Roger, Tom. Is John still up?
Oh, yes. We're still scrambling around here trying to get the place squared away.
Okay. You might check and see if he wants to talk over landmark tracking tonight, or if he wants to wait until morning to go over some of that.
Apollo, Houston. Say again about landmark tracking?
Roger, John. The guys in the back room have come up with some critiques on the marking, if you're interested in discussing it.
Sure. Go ahead.
Okay. Talk about F-1 first. The marking on that was just great; the timing between marks was just what they were looking for. One comment: they observed your pitch rate about two-tenths of a degree per second, and they don't know how it appeared to you, but that it's their opinion that it increased it just a little better to give you maximum marking time. But the marks on F-1 were really great. On B-l, you probably - you obviously noted the problem. It appeared that you started marking about a minute and a half early. Your spacing was good, and I guess you noticed then - if you weren't sure, didn't have it below you then you took quite a while between the fourth and fifth marks, and your pitch rate on that one was about 0.15 degrees per second, and it was a little bit too low to get the maximum marking time. The last mark was pretty near the trunnion limit, as you probably observed. Have you got any comments on the B-1? The marks were still good except for there, but they're not quite as good as on F-1. It was pretty good OJT (On the Job Training) for the first crack at it.
That F-1 is a great big crater. So what I did was I tracked the little crater on the edge of it. I couldn't even -the whole - the F-1 that I was tracking was - My whole optics was clean down inside of it.
Schmidt, back here, says that's great. The way to do it.
And that B-1 is no small crater, either.
Comment on the 1½-minute-early mark, John. Did we pass you up the time that was wrong? Or did you start a little early, or what?
No. I just started marking whenever I saw it. I can't see - It seems like that's what you ought to do. You see the thing comes out from behind the lunar module and it's acquisition is - You really got to hurry on it. So I wasn't really paying attention to the clock. When I'm flying it by myself, I want to get the first mark, at least, as soon as I can. I get a feel for this thing and I think it will work out all right.
Okey doke. No problem. That was what we were wondering. If you had really started on the TP time, or if you started early, or perhaps we passed you up a piece of time that was a little early? And I guess that's about all the comments we got here, John.
I think it went okay.
Roger, We concur. It was good marks.
You did a good job, today, and got a big day tomorrow, so Deke says let's go to sleep. Get ready for it.
Yes. We concur that. We're getting a little bushed up here, and we're just about to turn in and fix breakfast.
Deke wants you to hurry up and eat. He says he's getting hungry.
Okay.
Hey, Deke. Don't forget to skip lunch today. You didn't have time for it.
Okay. He's one up on you. He only gets one meal tomorrow then, I guess.
That's right. Keep him honest.
Okay, Apollo 10. Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Roger, Tom. We've got about a minute and a half a minute 45 until LOS. There's a couple of things we'd like to confirm. First of all, we'd like to make sure you're in Auto RCS, that you disabled Bravo and Charlie quads, and that you set up Bravo and Delta roll in the DAP. And, also, we'd like to confirm with Gene-o that he did close out the cabin after transferring power. We want to make sure that he got the circuit breakers status as for the checklist. We just - we just want a confirm on that.
Everything is squared away there. We're still trying to eat, get the little things squared here. That's why we haven't got to the DAP yet. Well get it.
Okay. Mighty fine, Tom. Were just about a minute from LOS. We just want to confirm those things.
Okay.
And I guess well be losing comm with you pretty shortly. You about ready to turn it in for the night.
Yes. I think we may make one quick contact with you before we sack out. We want to make sure we get called on time because it's going to be a busy day.
Roger. Sure is. You say you may contact us again, coming around the other side?
Right. We may do that.
Okay. We'll be waiting.
Okay, they said they wanted to - use B and D in roll [garble].
No, let it go, Gene-o. Just let it go.
What, Gene-o?
We'll call you.
Roger that.
You - Okay, use - fail A/C [garble]?
Gene-o.
Yes.
I made you some apples sauce and juice in here. Okay?
And there it is to go.
Fail B and C?
Huh?
To tell you the truth, I don't know where we are.
Okay, 2, zero, use A/C.
...?
...Okay, so we turn A/C Roll, Off; right?
Yes; A/C Roll, Off.
B/D Roll, Off.
[Garble]. No, I tell you, you can use two quads. I think what he meant was two adjacent quads, John.
Okay, well, we just failed B and C in the DAP.
A and C.
B and C.
Yes, why don't you write down - He wanted quads - Okay.
You want some apple sauce? Coming up.
Here you go, Gene-o. You want some juice with it? Here, drink some juice.
I think I'm just going to challenge me a wet pack tomorrow morning.
Yes.
How about some beef'? That ham [garble] make me shit.
Alright.
You want to grab some beef wet pack?
Yes. That's got a lot of flavor [garble] to drink?
Here's a bunch of stuff in here; I'm going to. How about a beef wet pack for breakfast.?
What did you say to pass there, Gene-o?
Here's [garble].
Gene-o, let me have a drink when you get finished, Wash down a vitamin pill, and I'll give you this right back.
Where you going, for a [garble]?
No, [garble], Gene-o, Let me borrow the gun for a minute.
Pretty good, ain't it? That apple sauce? No?
You want to just keep it over here, and we can open up and start in on it in the morning ?
Okay with me.
86 hours. An hour late to start the crew rest [garble] 7 hours. Shit! And we wake up at 93 hours.
Well, shit; then why do we even bother?
[Garble].
Did you realise that - everything goes right; we're - we're halfway Over - pretty soon?
Okay. You want to put those dump bags over there? We got everything in them that we need?...
Where do you want to put them?
I thought - Well, we could put them back behind here tonight, back of these ...
Good idea.
Yes, if they'll fit in there. Then all we have to do is - when we come back from the LM [garble] just let the bastards lay there.
[Garble].
Huh?
[Garble].
[Garble] pretty cleaned up.
You want to sleep on the bottom or up here?
I'd just as soon sleep up here if it's all the same to you; I can't sleep on that goddamn thing.
Okay, [garble] Gene-o, I'll tell you what; let me switch over there real quick, and I'll take a quick leak in this bag down there ... Here, I'll just do it ...my feet
What in the hell was that noise?
Do you see my checklist anywhere, you guys. CMPs.
Oh, yes.
Oh, that's Deadband Min... That's what happened. That's the Deadband.
They're over by Gene-o somewhere. Gene-o's got one. Oh, you did; OK. Thanks. Yes. OK. Thanks, babe..
[Cough.]
I'm all tangled up in this [garble]. Here you go.
[Garble].
OK.
Huh?
OK.
[Garble].
[Garble].
[Cough.] Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
Here; you want a wet towel to wipe your face off? It'll make you feel a hell of a lot better. You want a wet towel? I'll just put some cold water on it. Really makes you feel good.
Hey, John.
Yes.
I'll tell you, kill my intercom so all I hear is just S-band. Will you do that?
Okay. There's something wrong here; the DAP is just kicking its head off.
Just let it go. You went; to go back to - Kill me. Just kill the intercom.
OK. Hear it?
Yes? Huh? Well, B and D is roll. Yes, B and D Roll, On; and B and C are out in the autopilot. A and C are the only ones that's On.
Huh?
Apollo 10, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 10. Over.
Roger, 10. This is Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Could you take a look at the DAP and see if that's what you want?
Okay. We sure will.
It sounds like it's really using a lot of fuel - sounds like it's using a lot of fuel out there. I don't know, maybe we haven't got the right thing set up here.
Okay, John. We'll take a look at it here.
Apollo 10, Houston.
Go ahead. Over.
Okay. On these RCS jets, we'd like to confirm. I think maybe the problem may be in which ones we've got on and off, and what we'd like to do is to turn off or disable C2, which is minus roll, and B2, which is minus roll. That's Charlie 2 and Bravo 2 and Bravo 4, which is minus yaw.
Okay. But now wait a minute. We had to turn off the 4 and B3 because John undid the high gain - because Gene undid the high-gain antenna.(in the LM)
Okay. Apollo 10, this is Houston. Roger. This configuration will take care of that, although I gave you one wrong thruster, here. Let me - let me go over the ones we'd like disabled or turned off, again. That'll be Charlie 3 instead of Charlie 2. So it's Charlie 3, which is plus pitch; Bravo 4, which is minus yaw; and Bravo 2, which is minus roll. Those three we want disabled, and I have two of them to turn on as soon as you get those.
Okay. I got those turned off.
Okay. And then I'd like for you to turn on Alpha 1 and Alpha 2. Alpha 1, plus roll and Alpha 2, minus roll.
Okay.
Okay. That configuration ought to do it, John. How's the sleep status going? Are you the only one awake, or have you got everybody awake and running around in there?
No, everybody's asleep. But, now wait a minute. C4 and B3 are also off. You know that?
Okay. Roger. That's right. We're turning off the entire B and C, Bravo and Charlie.
Okay. So this configuration that we've got on the Auto RCS switch - switches is now compatible with the DAP - is that correct?
Okay. That's confirmed. It is compatible.
Okay.
Apollo 10, Houston.
Go ahead.
Yes, John. We realize this configuration is different than the one you've been used to seeing in the PTC, but this is the normal orbital lunar configuration. And G&C has - has checked it, over, and they're sure that this is the way we want to be set up.
Okay. We just heard a lot of thruster noise out there, and I figured I'd better wait up and check with you guys to make sure we're doing the right thing.
Okay. We sure appreciate it. Why don't you go ahead and get to sleep now? You've had a big day.
10, this is Houston. G&C says you can probably expect more jet firings now that were in lunar orbit, because we're holding an attitude to keep the antenna positioned right. You can expect a lot more firings than we had when we were PTC.
Roger. I understand that.
