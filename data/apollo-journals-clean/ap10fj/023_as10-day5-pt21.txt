Okay.
I'm coming up on 35 seconds.
Blank. 35 seconds.
Okay, Gene-o. We need to open the...
Turn on the clock, babe.
Okay.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
We're burning. Gee, you can really feel the acceleration.
Okay, here it goes.
Open.
We're burning, John, we're burning. We've got 29 to go, 26 to go.
Roger.
to go. Watch the AGS, Tom, it's counting better for you. Okay, I'm closing these right now.
You've got it open.
We're okay.
Man, you can really feel that.
Null them out, babe. You got a light vehicle.
That's it.
You want to get that one?
Yes.
Snoopy, did you complete the burn? Over.
Burn complete, John.
Don't want to use too much - Shit!.
Want to take that one out or not? Okay.
Okay. All zeros and 4. Go. Proceed.
Good burn, John.
Gee, I wouldn't give you a nickel in a candy store for the - What?
That weird noise is on VHF B.
It's a what?
It's on VHF B.
Is that right?
Yes.
Okay, Let's go up and get him, Tom. The AGS says he knows where he is.
Okay.
76 and 64. Okay, I've got to load the W-matrix as soon as that thing comes out. The AGS needle is 48.2 by 41.6? Shit!
How do you want to do the plane change, Gene?
John, let me pick a number. Any number you pick, if you've got time to figure it out. Let me load the W-matrix here.
Roger. I show you at 48.2 by 41.
That's what we got. 48.2 by 41.6.
I got a good lock-on.
Think you found him?
Yes, we're locked, babe. Good solid lock-on, John.
Roger.
Okay, if you got a good solid lock-on, Tom, you can go ahead to LGC, and it should take it, all the way. Tracker lights should come on. That's him locking on. Okay, that's good.
I show you at 142.7 miles.
Roger. We're at 142.7, babe.
Look at that number. Look at that number. Every time we get a big high number. I'm going to copy that one down.
When is your CDH time? Over.
I just got 104:43:52.71.
Okay.
Good. After that first one, they're good.
Say it to John.
Did you get that, John?
104:43:57.
104:43:52.71.
That's right down the alley.
And I'll pick a plane-change time here right away.
I'm going to PGNS now.
Hello, Charlie Brown. Snoop.
Go ahead. Over.
We don't need to show any TV on docking. If you get a chance, just go ahead and put up the docking target.
Say again? Over.
Roger. We don't need to show them any TV on the docking. If you just put up - if you get a chance, go ahead and put up the docking target.
Alrighty.
If you guys too much That's the only problem.
I can imagine.
Hey John, how about the plane change of 104:15:00?
Roger. Thank you.
Give me a CDH time, and I'll start the event timer?
There it is, right there.
Okay.
Holy smoley, babe. I'll tell you.
How you doing?
I need a drink of water. Let's take a look at our systems real quick. Everything looks good here.
Ascent water is 90 percent; O2 is 95 percent; same for Ascent 2.
air in this water. Not as much, but there's air in it.
I see what may have happened. You know when you stand up like this and you look at a switch? You could nearly say that that's Off. Son of a bitch!
That's a mistake anyone could have made, if we made it.
Yes.
I assume we did, and so what? So what? That's my feelings. So what? So, we made it. We recovered from it.
When it started to go, I - I...
I was ready to burn in AGS and align our PGNS to our AGS and then do an alignment. That's what we had to do after insertion anyway.
Yes.
Looking at that damn, dry, gray sand for so long, I don't know where the hell we are.
I don't either. It's starting to look like home, nearly, isn't it? Not quite, but...
You know, you'd call it more at home if it had more security, but son of a bitch, there ain't much security down there at all.
Yes.
I don't know how the hell guys have lived with this Velcro as long as they have, but it is the shittiest stuff, I tell you.
That Z-axis track's taking more fuel.
Five more marks and we'll get a - Take some inside while the Sun's on us.
Yes, that's a good point.
You know what the setting is?
Might could, I guess.
Has it got it on there? On the side?
guess.
No, it's got - is that it on the table?
Huh? It doesn't tell you in here.
Okay. Go ahead.
Do something.
Smile, and say 'Hi'. Look out at the window.
Must be coming over the landing site again. Oh, hell. We're on the back side.
Back side.
There. Take some this way.
Yes.
Get it as far away over there as you can, and that'll do it. Hello there, from the men in the Moon.
You can't really bounce around when you're tied down like this.
No.
Man.
Well, why don't you - why don't you - I flashed up in here, why don't you try and flash back in there. The rest of it, take it outside. Okay?
Okay.
I'll just take the rest of it outside.
I wish I could do this cheaper. John, you ought to hear these thrusters firing in here. It's really like a big garbage can getting banged around.
We ought to record our fuel. We should have recorded that fuel and I didn't.
I have been, Tom. I've been recording after every burn.
After every burn. Good. Go ahead and do it.
in plane.
John, I'm tracking right on the bellyband, and my inertial needles are right zero, babe.
Yes. Well, I'm not showing you right on zero, but it's nothing to worry 20 miles something.
Yes.
John, remember how we said this morning - we all said how good it was to put these suits on for a change? Still feel that way?
Still good to put these suits on for a change?
I never said that.
I guess I did. I felt like that for a few minutes. I must have lost my mind.
Actually, it did feel good for a change.
Helium is Well, that's right because we use more fuel on ascent. Boy, the APS sure didn't use much pressure out of there, did it?
No.
I recorded it when we started burning and...
Tom, we need a backup mark at 36 minutes.
Yes.
You all do the - plane change at 104:15, right, Gene-o?
Yes, 104:15, John.
I hope there is none though. Boy that's a long time in - Look at this.
That recycle is taking forever!
Yes.
What, John?
Our REFSMMAT's slipped.
Yes.
John, this consistently is saying we're about 152 to 154 miles. It looks like TPI has gone 54 seconds away from us, made it a little bit longer.
Roger.
We got real good numbers, plus 0.30, 0, and plus 1.9 on our first cut.
That's nothing.
There's Jack's crater, again.
I'm showing a plus point - I'm showing minus 1.1 for the plane change. That looks good.
Wait a moment and I'll take a look at what ours says here in a minute.
We show minus 3.1, which is again the opposite direction. We will not do it, John.
Okay.
Okay. Minus 36 minutes. Okay. There's 126 - 7 (nautical miles, 235 km). Let's see how this compares to the nominal.
23 and 10.
Hey, John, if you can, when we get back, see if you can get a picture of the ascent stage only, will you?
Okay.
Okay. Great.
Look at the boulders on that.
You guys said you weren't going to do that plane change?
No. We are not going to do it. If you can, when we get back - Don't sweat it - but if you can, see if you can get some ascent-only pictures. Ascent-stage-only pictures.
Yes, I will.
Okay.
I got you on the other frame, but I don't know if this dang camera was in the right focus for up there, or the right setting. But I was really hopping.
We got it all taped up for you.
Your Hasselblad ain't taped up.
It should be f:8 at 250th, something like that.
Yes. That's what I had it set on. I think I need.
I got to call for another Verb 93 here and initialize, even though we don't do the plane change. I'll do it about plane-change time.
Look at our rendezvous radar.
Want some water, babe?
Yes. Do you want some grape juice?
Think I'll have some grape juice. All we got to do is get back in dock and get that tunnel pressurized and we're home, Gene-o. hours to go.
One more big burn after that. Boy, I'll tell you those burns sure settle that crap that's laying around here, don't they?
Yes. Boy, that ascent burn was wild, and we're the first ones that's had an evaluation of it. See, 9 only burned it for a couple of seconds. But that thing was whoo, whoo.
Is that right?
Yes.
Boy, it - it was rocking, I thought...
Boy, it rocks.
John, could you see our plume when we fired?
Yes, I could on the descent burn.
Look at that crater, Gene-o. See those black things where it slumps down? Right near the rim is black stuff and halfway down is black. See that?
Yes.
In that region down there?
Boy, that is something.
Hey, John, you ain't never seen so many Master Alarms and warning lights as you've seen on this bird.
Strange things, we got computers going on in here, too. You wouldn't believe some of them.
On that phasing burn, we had the master caution on three times with the Descent Quantity going low twice and the Gimbal light's coming on. Also our fuel pressure showed zero. Other than that, it was a pretty nominal burn, John.
You can see how these craters are formed? How the sides slump in and leave these tailings in the back?
Yes, yes, I sure can.
There's that one that Jack may wanted.
When is the ground supposed to pick us up?
Pick us up at 24 and 25.
Roger, after CDH.
Yes.
No,.
Yes.
There's an update after the - after the - initialize the W-matrix.
What was it?
Okay. Now it's taking one. The first mark after you initialize the W-matrix...
Is that the.?
is Look at that.
Zero.
Look at that - on AGS Min Deadband. Look at how close the AGS thinks that is to it. Look at it.
(Laughter) Want to do this in PGNS, or we do it in AGS Attitude Hold? Let's do it in AGS Attitude Hold and see what we get.
Yes, let's do it. Let's try it. We owe it to the vehicle to...
Either these oxygen gauges don't work, or we just ain't using any.
Our cabin pressure is holding real good. Real tight.
It's warm in here, but not exceptionally hot.
Yes.
Turn that cabin fan on; see how much noise it makes.
We'll make one more recycle after five marks and then let it go to 12 minutes. Oh, Tom, 23 minutes, I need a backup.
Okay.
AGS is right on. Look, 105.5 miles (195.4 km) and 129 feet per second (39.3 m/sec). That's not bad. 23 minutes, T.P.
Okay. Mark it. R-dot is 126.
126. Is that all?
Yes. About what it's supposed to be. Yes. That's within a foot per second of the nominal.
I still don't hear José out there. Were they there when they burned CSI? The ground wasn't in contact, were they?
I'm sorry, Tom, I - I didn't hear you.
We were out of contact with the ground when we burned CSI, weren't we?
Yes. We need another backup mark at 10 minutes.
Yes.
You guys got 21 minutes and counting, about?
Yes. Yes.
Yes. About 21:20.
Mark.
Okay.
How's the burn over there doing on RCS fuel, John?
Well, I was doing okay until the last hundred miles or so, and I had to put it tight deadband; because when we started talking about things like plane changes, I want to be able to go back and look at the ball. I think we're fat right now.
Yes.
I think we're in, right now.
Yes. Here comes the Earth! Beautiful. I'll get it. It really comes up.
Charlie Brown, Houston. We're standing by. Over.
Roger.
Burn was nominal. Your burn was 45.3 and you burned was 46.9.
Charlie Brown, Houston. How did the CSI go?
Isn't that phenomenal?
Boy, this tracking the LM against the background of the Moon or something down there is really fantastic.
We copy, Charlie Brown.
This is Snoopy. How do you read me?
Let me get them on High Gain, babe.
Hey. Snoop. Houston. We're reading you four-by-four. Over.
Roger. We had a nominal burn. Everything went good, and we had a beautiful Earthrise as you came up from behind the horizon.
Golly.
Roger. Need you Noun 81 numbers, Houston. Need you Noun 81 numbers and your residuals. Over.
Roger. Stand by.
Okay. For CSI the Noun 81 numbers were 45, 43, 00. Residuals were 0, minus 0.4, and 0.
Roger, Snoop. We copy 45, 43, 00. Residuals: 0, minus 0.4, 0. Thank you much.
Now we're going to try and put you High Gain.
Roger.
We copy that. Go.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Did Snoop do a plane change? Over.
Charlie Brown, Snoop. Correction, Charlie...
Wonder if I can call Noun 75 up?
We thought we could do it then. It's at the plane-change time; and at the plane-change time, which was 104:15, I had minus 1.1 and they had plus. They had one in the opposite direction, so we decided not to do it there.
Roger. We copy.
What was that?
Hello Houston. This is Snoopy on High Gain. How do you read?
Roger. We got you on High Gain, Snoop.
Okay. This High Gain stuff is a piece of cake. I don't know what you were all so worried about.
Wish we could say the same about the Omnis.
Yes, all I did was look at you coming over the horizon, and I pointed High Gain up and down my Z-axis like I hoped I could; and man, there you were, and she locked on.
Roger. We got you, and we got you counting down, and we see you 16 45.
Okay. Seems like every time we initialize or call a P20 for the first time, the first Mark we have to reject because it's got horrendous 5-digit numbers in it.
Roger. We copy.
Charlie Brown, this is Snoopy.
Go ahead. Over.
It looks like TPI - My last recycle, TPI moved away from us 2 minutes and 40 seconds. I'm going to go and try calculating out plane-change here and compare it with yours, but it looks like we're in good shape. I got Delta-H of 14.9.
Roger.
Roger, Snoop. We copy. Houston.
Okay. I got you at 96.25 miles (178.3 km) now. That sound about right?
Roger, Charlie Brown, Snoop. We're locked on with you all the way. Right together.
I show you're flying right straight down the bellyband, too.
Roger. You're right in plane with us, Charlie Brown.
Go back through.
Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy. One thing that looks real good to us, is the Rendezvous Radar temperature has kept fairly cool. In fact, where it is now, at 80, is about as hot as it's gotten all day. Over.
Roger, we copy, Tom. Thank you much.
Okay, we'll Proceed at 12 minutes.
Charlie Brown, this is Snoop. Our plane change is NG, so we're not going to burn ours. We'll wait for yours. If it sounds good, we'll look at it.
Roger.
Listen to that antenna move around. You know, with the - between that and the radar, and the...
Snoop, say again the CSI - the CDH time
CDH time is 104:43:52.71.
Roger. We copy.
CDH: 104:43:52.71.
That's it, Charlie Brown.
Isn't that magnificent, Tom? Would you believe it? North pole is on the righthand side.
Right.
Better get the 13th Mark.
We got beaucoup.
Okay. I'm showing a minus 4.2.
John, you don't want to burn it, do you?
No.
Let...
I don't believe it.
I don't either, John. We're going to ignore it here.
You can take it out quite easily.
Yes.
Let's not burn it. Ours was in the opposite direction even with the sign changed, but let's not burn it. You're right down to belly band, babe.
13th mark will get it.
We'll see.
10 minutes, Tom, I need a mark.
Isn't that just fantastic, Tom?
Stand by.
Mark.
Okay.
124 feet per second (37.8 m/sec).
124. What about - That's all I need.
Yes, the is.
That's all I need. 0.1 and 137.9. 0.1...
You want me to Proceed? Get it?
Okay. I got plus 1.2 Delta-VZ, and X is plus 0.2.
You want me to Proceed?
Okay - Okay, that's good - that's good. Yes.
Okay. My 81 and a minus 0.5, 0, and minus 2.9 for P33.
Okay, John, that's good. We'll burn ours. Ours is plus 0.1, 0, and plus 3.0.
Snoop, Houston. We see your solution. It looks prima. Over.
Charlie Brown, did you read me? Houston may have cut you out - it's plus 0.1, 0, and plus 3.0.
Roger.
That's plus 0.1, 0, and plus 3.0.
Okay, and the backups gave me plus 0.2 and plus 1.2, so we're in good shape.
Roger. They both look great. Yes.
Okay, we'll make this AGS, Attitude Hold, and let's make sure we get the right one.
Okay. We're all set?
We're set.
Okay.
Call P00.
Let's get this thing updated? Verb 47.
Ready? Ready?
Yes.
Proceed.
We're coming over the old craters.
Okay, babe, call up 41 and get me an 06 86.
Plus 0.1, zip, plus 3.0.
This is the nicest CDH - This is the nicest CDH solution we ever got.
Thats right, John. Looks like our CSI solution and the total targeting was just fantastic.
Oh, I wish I had a...
Hasselblad, huh?
Look at them. Boo. See out there.
Yes, yes, you can see across both of them...
hit.
see across both of them.
Okay. Let's make sure we get the right AGS stuff this time. Go to Enter, to.
Going to do this in AGS. Right?
Yes. We'll give the old AGS a try again. We'll make sure we're at Attitude Hold. We knew what was wrong before.
Okay. What's the procedure now?
The procedure is, babe, just go to AGS, Attitude Hold for the burn.
Yes.
AGS Mode Control, Attitude Hold; Guidance Control, AGS; and that's it.
What about Deadband?
Deadband, Min - Deadband, Min; AGS, Mode Control, Attitude Hold and Guidance Control, AGS.
I'm not sure they weren't taking a wild guess at them answers anyway. I'm not sure - they could have been wrong.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Over.
Hello, Charlie Brown. Houston. Over.
Go ahead. Go ahead, Houston.
Houston, go ahead. Charlie Brown's reading you.
Roger, Snoop. I'm not reading him at all. Notice - We noticed he bypassed his roll maneuver at about 104:33. We recommend he manually roll 180 before he does his P20 Auto maneuver over, out to the burn.
Roger.
He got that.
Okay. We barely heard him. Thank you.
John, we're at 3:43, 3:42, counting down to the burn.
You want to make sure you key those in - You put them in Pulse and then key them and then go to...
We don't have Z-axis track anymore, do we?
Sure we do. Here.
Yes. Okay.
Sure you do.
How come we're pitching up like that.
Oh, I'm sorry, you do not have Z-axis track.
You better believe it, babe.
Wait a minute. In - We went through and we killed 20, but we didn't kill P00; but we got radar discrete but no Z-axis track.
Listen, these error needles aren't aligned, either.
Yes, sure, we got the radar discrete but no Z-axis track at this point.
That's right.
This means you want to thrust down, babe, with the hand controller.
Yes, TTCA is...
Down and aft. Down...
Aft and left.
Down and aft, but that's down, that's the main thing.
That's 2 minutes, John.
Roger.
What's your first hack at TPI?
John, our hack at TPI that we put in back there at...
Oh, what...
José, are you maneuvering now? Okay, we just lost lock.
Okay, you ought to go to...
Slew.
It's going to be about 2 minutes later than what we had, John. And that first hack at TPI that they updated us on was 105:21:01.00.
Roger.
Okay.
That's what we'll go with. It looks like it may slip about 2 minutes.
Let's go to AGS, Attitude Hold. Alright?
Okay. You got your - your attitudes set? Okay. Get ready. You ready?
Stand by. Go back - go back to PGNS. Go.
Beautiful.
Okay. DSKY blanks...
John, we're within 35 seconds.
Roger.
Down 3 and aft.
Yes.
10 seconds. We're in AGS, Min deadband attitude hold. 4, 3, 2, 1.
Burning. Skoshi more. That ought to get it. Watch it slip - flip.
Okay, 0...
0.10 and minus 1.
Burn was good.
Excellent.
Roger, Snoop. We copy.
And did you copy the residuals?
That's affirmative. We got it all. Over.
Alright. Okay, go back up, John, and we'll be all set to track.
Roger.
And we have a solid lock-on, John.
Okay, Charlie Brown. This is Snoopy. I've had you in reflected sunlight out there - for about - for about 90 miles (167 km) on. It was just very clean. It's just about the same as around the Earth when we used to see the Agena, but I've got you as a little yellow dot out there, and Ive been tracking you since about 90 miles (167 km). Over.
And Ive got only one eye power.
Hey, John, after aligning this platform with the AOT, I can see why your eyes are - why you're saying what you're saying. I'll tell you.
Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy. We're right over by Moltke and the landing site again. Getting a view of it now from 45 miles and again - just extrapolated from below. It looks like we got about 25 to 30 percent clear area in there. Over.
Roger. We copy, Snoop. Over.
Roger. We're coming up to the craters Sabine and Ritter, and we can see U.S. 1 here, and the sides of U.S. 1 again are rounded and but the whole thing is dropped down just like reported before.
Roger. We copy, Snoop.
Houston, do you have a good gouge on...
Go ahead.
Do you have a good gouge on the setting for internal film to use outside?
Stand by.
Roger. Use two f-stops higher, Snoop, on that film; and, Tom, if you've got a chance to talk a minute, could you describe Landing Site 2 from 8 miles (14.8 km)? We didn't have you in communications at that time.
Okay, Houston. Go ahead. You were cut out. Say you want me to describe the Landing Site 2 again?
Roger. We can get it later, Snoop. It's a little busy now. We'll get it later. We were out of communications with you at that time, but we will get it later. Over.
Yes. Okay. The approach end looks lots smoother than some of the Orbiter photos show. It's still estimate 25 to 30 per cent, say, semi clear area for - if the LM has enough hover time, at least from what we can see at 50,000 feet, it should not be a problem. However, if you come down in the wrong area and you don't have the hover time you are going to have to shove off.
We copy.
Roger. Okay. We got solid lock-on now, and we're working on P34.
Snoop, Houston. We don't read Charlie Brown. Would you relay that, if he's done his 180 roll, to try the High Gain for us.
Roger. Charlie Brown, this is strictly as a relay. If youve done completed your 180 degree roll, will you try your High Gain for Houston? Over.
Houston, Charlie Brown. On the High Gain.
Roger, Charlie Brown. We read you. How you doing?
Houston, Charlie Brown. On High Gain Antenna.
Roger. Charlie Brown, Houston. We're reading you five-by.
Hello, Snoop. Houston. If you use any different f-stops on the film, we'd like for you to mark it so we can process it right. Over.
That ought to be a ball.
Roger.
I'll try, Charlie; I'll do my best.
Okay, Gene-o. I was just - had- Don't worry about it. Sorry.
No, don't be sorry. Hey, you guys are floating on the world out there sideways.
Okay.
As the Earth came up, on this Earth day, I guess you would call it, the north pole was to the right and the south pole was to the left, and looks like - see a lot of clouds over the Pacific Ocean. We were kind of busy. Didn't take much time to notice, but it was a beautiful sight. Over.
Roger. We're here and still spinning.
Okay.
Charlie, I don't know how the Big Man must see things, but if his view is any better than ours, it's got to be fantastic.
Copy.
Houston, Charlie Brown. I'd like to get a sunset time. Over.
Roger, Charlie Brown. Stand by.
Oh, never mind. It happens so fast around here, I ought to be instantaneously aware of it.
Charlie Brown, Houston. We got a time for you for sunset: 104 and 58. Over.
104:58? Over.
Affirmative.
Roger.
I show you at 64.89 miles (120.18 km). How do you agree with that, Snoop? 64.7 (miles) (119.8 km).
Roger. You're right on the money. We show you about 64.6 (miles) (119.6 km) now.
Roger.
We're correlated right down there. That VHF is working beautiful. Just like the radar.
That's mighty good gear.
Sure seems to be.
Hey; Houston, Snoopy.
Go ahead, Snoop.
Okay. For the record, we have been operating with Charlie Brown the whole time while he's been on VHF ranging, in ICS/PTT, and our hot mike apparently does not bother John at all; and we've had such good luck S-band with you folks down there that we've had hot mike a very short period of time.
We copy all that. Thanks a bunch.
That S-band antenna makes noise, but it sure does track.
Okay.
Roger. I see you. Very good.
Okay. Houston, this is Snoopy. We're at 60 nautical miles (111 km) closing and R dot looks real fine. I'm sure you're reading it down there. Everything looks real good from here, and I still don't have his flashing light from this distance of 60 miles (111 km). Over.
Roger, Tom. We copy. We got you plotting right down the line on your charts. Over.
Roger. Thank you, Charlie. It's looking good here.
Okay. They're on. I'll turn on these running lights and EVA lights too, Tom. Maybe you can - can see them when you get closer.
Okay.
Snoopy, you got a later TPI time?
Roger.
Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy. AGS comes out with a TPI at an angle of 26.51, of 24.4 to initiate, 55.9 to total, and that time is just about the same time I'm looking at right now of 105:23:20.
We Copy, Snoop. Thank you much.
John, our new TPI time is 105:23:06.01; 105:23:06.01.
Roger. I got it.
That's only moved up towards us about 12 seconds.
Okay, John. Coming up on 52, say, 0.3 miles or so. I still don't have you in the sight. No problem. We're locked-on solid.
Did you get your final TPI time? Over.
Stand by.
Go ahead.
John No. We're not going to push final Comp until 12 minutes, but the latest one we got is what I just gave you.
Okay. That will be fine.
Is that converging with you?
Well, that thing is still calculating. It really takes a while.
Charlie Brown, Snoop. We've suddenly seen on this last recycle through 6 feet per second out of plane.
Roger. Wait a second..
Hello, Houston, Snoopy. Do you have somebody that can read our erasable - check what our radar angle bias is? Over.
Roger. Stand by.
Hey! My TPI time - my TPI time - this later, is 105:23:16.79. How's that for a good correlation.
Snoopy, Houston. Your radar bias is in the noise. Over.
Okay. Real fine, Charlie. Thank you very much.
Roger. And Charlie Brown, Houston. Over.
Go ahead. Over.
Roger. If you get a chance, we'd like to look at...
Okay, Charlie Brown. We'd like you to bring your Logic up so you can dock anytime. And so we can give you a Go for the arm and also, I did you get a chance to cycle through the tunnel vent valve to LM Press? Over.
No. Negative. Not yet.
Okay.
Okay. The - you want the - SECS breakers are coming On, and the Pyro A and B battery breakers are going In.
Charlie Brown, Houston. You are Go for Pyro Arm at your convenience. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
Charlie Brown, Snoop. When you get your solution, we're interested in the out-of-plane part, so call it down to us, would you?
Yes sir.
Okay. My Noun 81 is minus 21.8, plus 4½, and plus 10.14,
Plus 4½.
Yes. For a change.
Roger.
Houston, our new TPI time is 105:22:56.19.
Roger. Copy.
Why don't you give me an LOS time and an AOS while you've got it, while we got a chance.
Roger, Snoop. LOS is 105:32. AOS, 106:19. Over.
I got them. Thank you.
Roger. And Charlie Brown, Your LOS about the same.
How my...
Your LOS about the same, Charlie Brown, and AOS also. Over.
Roger. I missed those.
Okay, LOS...
105:32 and 106:19.
Okay. I'll get them for you later.
Okay. Charlie Brown, this is Snoop. I'm finally starting to see your flashing light, very faintly at 42 miles (77.8 km). Very faintly.
Roger. 41.7, isn't it?
Yes.
Charlie Brown, this is Snoopy. We're burning your out-of-plane. Here's my Noun 81 for you that we're going to burn.
Go.
Plus 21.7, minus 4.5, and minus 9.6.
Roger.
Okay. Charlie Brown, this is Snoopy. We're pitching down to put our X-axis towards you for the Auto maneuver from TPI.
Roger.
Okay. We're at burn attitude, Charlie Brown.
Roger. Almost me, too.
How about that?
2 minutes to the burn.
Roger.
And Charlie Brown, our charts agree very closely, so we're Go.
Roger. My numbers agree with your numbers.
Then, I guess were all in agreement, then. Let's go.
1:19 to the burn.
Roger.
Mark.
1 minute to the burn.
Roger.
35 seconds. DSKY blank.
7 seconds, John.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Burning.
We're burning.
Go to it.
We copy.
Got 15 to go.
Roger.
10 to go.
Burn's complete.
Roger. Good show.
Snoop, Houston. We see you trimming. Good show.
Okay. 0, 1-1/10.
We copy, Snoop.
And Snoopy's pitching back up to acquire.
Houston, this is Snoop. You can't believe how noisy those thrusters are.
Roger, 10. Can't even imagine.
It sounds like being inside a big rain tub with about 2-inch (5-cm) hail beating all over you.
Hey, babe. Heres where the AGS.
Okay. Pitching up to give you radar target here.
He's waiting to...
Yes.
Okay, Snoop.
Okay, Houston. This is Snoopy. We have solid lock, and first update appears real good.
Roger, Snoop, we copy. We got 4 minutes 50.
Mark.
To LOS for you. Over.
Roger.
Houston, Snoop. I'm taking you off of High Gain.
Okay. Roger. You're reading my mind.
20.4 miles. Over.
Roger. I concur..
We're only 20 miles (37 km) way.
VHF, I think..
5 minutes now.
God damn! That one felt like it was coming inside.
I can barely see it.
Can you?
Just barely.
I can't see any flashing at all.
There he is.
with it.
Okay.
Okay, any time.
Mark it.
It's right on them.
Right on them?
Yes.
