Light on?
Roger.
We're burning.
Roger. Burning.
We're on the way.
Roger. We confirm.
10, Houston. Your S-IVB looks good.
Roger.
And guidance looks good.
Roger.
[Garble] light [garble].
Hello. Apollo 10, Houston. At 1 minute, you're looking great.
Roger. One minute, everything looks good on board.
It's starting to pick up the yaw, just as programmed.
Roger.
[Garble] off. Beautiful!
Here comes the Sun.
01:45.
2 minutes.
10, 2 minutes. You're looking great.
Roger.
Where's it going?
I don't know. I just - Feels like we're pitching [garble]. Steady as a rock.
Feel it - I can see it yawing.
Yawing?
It's yawing.
What a way to watch a sunrise!
Roger.
Okay, at 02:30; 105. 28,819 [garble].
Three-quarters of a g.
Roger. Copy, Tom.
[Garble] the sunrise. We must be getting higher, you know it? Okay, ... coming up on 3 minutes. Mark it.
Apollo 10, Houston. Coming up 3 minutes; trajectory looks great.
3 minutes.
Three minutes. Everything looks good, Charlie.
Cabin pressure [garble] high.
Apollo 10, Houston. We've got a predicted cut-off: 2 plus 39 plus 10.
2 plus 39 plus 10.
Wow! Right into the Sun, here.
Roger.
Holy [garble].
[Garble].
Okay, babe, there's a 03:50 coming up.
Coming up on 4 minutes.
Mark it.
And, Apollo 10, Houston. At 4 minutes everybody is saying Go. The S-IVB is looking great.
[Garble]. Roger, Houston. 10 looks good [garble].
Roger, Houston. 10, here. Looks good on board.
[Garble] I don't know either.
There's [garble].
We're getting a little [garble] high-frequency vibrations in the cabin.
Say again?
Were getting small high-frequency vibrations. Nothing to worry about...
Understand. Small yaw oscillation. 10?
Negative. High frequency vibrations.
Oh, Ah so.
Gosh!
Come on, we've got another 40 seconds to burn.
At 5 minutes, we still have you Go, 10.
Okay, we're coming up on 05:25, predicted 05:43. 05:30.
10, Houston, in the blind. At cut-off, Up Telemetry, IU to Accept.
[Garble].
Going on 40; 1, 2, 3. SECO! Son of a bitch!
SECO.
Roger. SECO. We confirm the cut-off.
Okay, we've gone 35,514[fps]. H-dot 42211 [4221.1 fps]. Up Telemetry, IU to Accept at 172.5 [altitude, nautical miles] at cut-off.
Roger. Copy.
And would you believe, my Delta-VC. reads minus 0.6?
Roger. Minus 0.6 on the Delta-VC. That's beautiful.
Can't beat that, Charlie.
Okay. Did you get that [garble]...
And, Charlie, we've got an O2 Flow High and a light in the middle of the burn, here, which we can't account for.
Stand by, John.
Okay, TVC Servo Power, [garble].
[Garble].
PCM Bit Rate, Low.
Okay, [garble]...
Apollo 10, Houston. In the blind. Have LOS at Redstone 2 plus 41. See you over Hawaii, 2 plus 44.
Roger. In trouble-shooting that thing, I went to Auto 2 on the suit circuit water accumulator. That's the only thing I could think of. It was right at 10 minutes when it happened.
Roger. We think that cabin pressure regs kicked in for that O2 flow, John.
They just went out, and the flow is starting to drop now, Charlie. Looks like we're in good shape.
Okay, fine. You're beginning to fade out. We think we'll be losing you through the Redstone here in about 30 seconds. Hawaii at 2 plus 44.
And, 10, in the blind. Everything we got looks nominal. You're on your way
...have to worry about besides radiation.
[Garble] the cabin?
Not yet, [garble].
[Garble]?
I read nothing.
Nothing on what?
On that red flowmeter.
Oh, shit.
Okay.
Here's your card there, okay?
I believe it worked slick as a whistle.
Do you want to - [garble], Okay?
Yes, okay. Do you want to stow your suit now, babe?
I can't. I ain't [garble].
[Garble]. Okay?
Well, yes. We won't switch leads.
Okay, You can use your - your thing here, right? You can talk on that.
I can see stars in the day - I can see something in the day - they're not stars. Shit. It's a bunch of crap.
[Garble]. Look at that world.
Okay.
You got the TV in each side up, José?
Hello. Apollo 10, Houston through Hawaii. How do you read? Over.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 10. Would you believe the world is starting to fade away?
Roger. We believe it, Tom. You're all Go here. FIDO confirms it was a perfect insertion. We'd like you to confirm that you're on omni Delta, and we're all Go.
[Garble]? It's easy to see [garble].
John, why don't you go hook up that [garble]?
Roger.
I've already hooked it up. How do you think this [garble] here cable here [garble]? You want to talk about something fantastic...
We're on omni Delta, Charlie, and there sure ain't any question about it from here.
Roger.
I don't meant the Delta, I mean the world.
We got you; we understand.
10, Houston. We expect the S-IVB to start to Sep attitude at 2 plus 54 plus 10, right on time. And your Sep attitude is looking good.
Roger.
Okay. John's in the left seat now, and I'm in the center seat. We've already changed,
Roger, Tom. Did you get a chance to get that radiation survey meter out?
Yes, I did, Charlie, and I read zero on every scale.
Okay. And what was the GET of that, Gene? About 245?
About 243.
Okay.
10, Houston. We'll have you AOS now until you get to LOS at the Moon.
Sounds like Chris has pretty good coverage.
Yes, sir. He's sitting back there smiling.
You ought to see us.
Chris says there ain't no backing out now.
That's for sure.
You can play our favorite song, Charlie, the one about Fly me Someplace or Somewhere.
Roger, That's up to you.
We've got three Marshall guys here, smiling from ear to ear, too.
Apollo 10, Houston. We'd like you to do a Verb 66 to get the state vector in the right position. And, if you've got time, comment on the ORDEAL tracking there for that backup TLI.
Okay. The initial track was just right on what the nominal was, and the ORDEAL was looking just what it should be.
Roger, Tom.
Say, Charlie. Looks like we might have a little closed-circuit TV up here.
Okay. How's it looking, Gene?
Well, I can't really tell too much, but at least it works closed-circuit.
Okay, fine. Goldstone's all configured. We'll be standing by.
Charlie, it's beautiful closed-circuit.
Hey, great, Gene. We can't wait...
I've got my own little show of these two guys up here. It's beautiful, really is.
Well, great. I hope it's that good down here. We're sitting on pins and needles waiting for it. And, if you've got a second, we'd like to, Tom, we'd like you to recap these S-IVB oscillations; give the guys one up on starting work on it.
Yes, okay. All the way through even into Earth orbit boost the S-IVB had just a slight little - it felt like - like both lateral and longitudinal vibrations to it, and after - It felt like it was running rough, at least compared to the Titan.
Okay.
And then after 3 minutes, superimposed upon the low frequency vibrations, came a real high frequency vib; I'd say in the ball park of 20 cps, something like that. And of course we were sweating it all the way, but it shut down right on time; but there was a definite shift to a high frequency superimposed upon the low frequency, at about 3 minutes into the TLI burn.
Roger. Is it a - give you a feeling like it - 2.2 Mach in the 104, something like that, just a real rumble?
Yes, kind of. Just about so much. We are starting the maneuver now, so we'll tell you later.
Roger.
Okay. Cabin pressure has [garble] to 57. Direct O2 coming Off.
Roger.
Okay. We show ourselves at the attitude. Over.
We confirm, 10. You're Go for Sep.
Roger. We're going to check the thrusters here, now.
10, you're Go for Pyro Arm and Go for Sep.
Roger.
[Garble].
Houston, this is Apollo 10. Could you confirm the firings? Over.
Say again.
Could you confirm the thruster firings? Over.
Stand by.
10, Houston. We confirm all the rotational inputs; we did not confirm the translational. As far as we're concerned, you are Go.
Roger.
10, we did see plus and minus X on the translational.
Roger.
10, Houston. The Noun 22 looks good to us.
We have SEP.
Roger.
That world is just incredible. There goes a panel, Charlie.
Roger. How do you read me, Gene?
Loud and clear. We don't have the S-IVB yet, but there goes a panel.
Roger.
That world is incredible.
Really moving?
Holy Moly, I sure hope we can show it to you, I really do.
Okay. I got the S-IVB.
Roger.
And there goes another [SLA] panel.
Roger. All retrograde, we hope.
I don't know what [garble] it is up here right now.
Yes.
Charlie, I've got the world on closed circuit here, so we're going to try and get High Gain.
Roger. Standing by.
Okay, babe. There's High Gain. The TV is On. I should be coming down to you, and I'll have to adjust it as we come along into the S-IVB.
Hey, it's beautiful, Gene. We got the black and white now with a little time delay on the color.
Okay. And the S-IVB ought to be coming in here in a second.
Roger.
Hey, we got the S-IVB coming into the top. The sun's really shining on it.
Okay. I'll try to adjust it for you
Hey, we got the color now.
You're on the air, Babe. Oh, that's beautiful.
Have you got the color?
Yes, sir. It's looking great!
I'm sorry it's tilted a little bit. That's the best I could do with the brackets.
No sweat; we got it right in the center of the screen, Gene. It looks like the Sun's really bright on it.
Tremendously so.
The Sun's got the S-IVB - the LM sort of blotted out; it's so bright.
Hey, your zooming in looks really good, Gene.
Charlie, I've got it closed down all the way. Does that help any?
Roger. The - In the center of the LM now, we still got a real - couple of real bright spots, but it's looking real good in color. We can, see the probe - correction, the drogue.
Gene, it's really looking good. The - It's the silver panels that are reflecting back real brightly.
They're awful [garble] right now, too.
Roger. The resolution is fantastic. You're drifting off just to the right a little bit.
10, Houston. You can't believe the picture we're getting. The resolution is really fantastic.
I'll tell you, this monitor makes it great.
How's the color, Charlie?
Say again.
How's the color?
It's really beautiful, Gene. You've got it framed just perfectly. The resolution...
Hey, I think the color will be beautiful once, we can show you the Earth.
Roger.
Old Snoopy sure looks good.
Yes. He sure do.
Old Charlie Brown is a mass of cord and wire floating around here, though.
I can imagine.
Houston, Charlie Brown. I've settled down now on the zoom, and the closing rate you see is the closing rate we've got.
Roger. We copy. Gene, if it looks like to you - We have a bright spot - it may be on your vidicon, coming in on your vidicon tube on the black and white. It's right above the drogue.
Yes, we've got it in real life. The camera is fully in the shade. That's just a reflection coming right off the - right off of Snoopy.
Rog.
10, we're afraid you might be burning a hole into your vidicon tube. Move it off to the - a little bit off of Snoop. I think those panels are so bright we might be getting problems with the vidicon tube.
All right.
I can just cover it up for a while if you like.
Stand by.
10, Houston. We'd like the LM - Snoopy back, if you could give it to us.
I'd be glad to.
Hey, that's looking great now, except for a couple of fingers there or something.
Good resolution; that's what they were.
You got your big hands in the way.
Hey, I don't know what you did, but the - It's really beautiful now. Really great.
We're just a little closer.
Yes.
Boy, the color is great, Gene.
Oh, boy. That's beautiful.
Hell, I got to watch it on TV, too. I've got - can't see out the window.
Hey, what's that guy doing on the front porch?
That's a green man, Gordo.
And John estimates 50 feet closing.
Roger.
How's the resolution?
Well, all I can say is it's really happening, and what hasn't happened you haven't seen yet.
Roger.
Really great resolution.
Charlie, we can't be more than about 5, 10 feet away.
Roger.
10, it's looking real stable to us. We show you closing slightly.
Roger.
Be docked in a second, I hope.
Roger.
10, Houston. You're looking good. We can see the markings on the rendezvous window. Looks like you just docked.
Roger. We've got a capture; we haven't fired yet.
Roger.
Gene, we can read the numbers on the LM docking window.
Snap, snap, and we're there. Got two grays.
Roger.
You saw the docking, Charlie.
We didn't get any Master Alarm. Everything looks snug.
Roger. Didn't look like there was any hardly any after dock - post docking oscillations.
Check.
Okay. Pyros coming Off.
Roger.
10, that's a great picture of the quads.
I'll try and take you on a quick tour. We're - I may have to hold you up for a little bit here.
Okay. John's going down to the LEB [Lower Equipment Bay] and, I'm going to the left seat now.
Roger, Tom. We're standing by.
Apollo 10, Houston. We'd like you to Safe the Logic.
Charlie, you're going to have to look at the same picture for a while until we get this integrity check complete.
Roger. We understand you are busy.
Okay. I'm watching.
Houston, this is 10. We are in the process of attempting to pressurize the tunnel.
Hello, Houston. This is 10. We're going to go ahead and suspend the TV here for about 10 minutes until we get a little bit squared away.
Roger. Understand.
We'll be back with you shortly.
Roger, Gene. Give me a call when you've got time to copy an evasive PAD.
Okay. I will.
