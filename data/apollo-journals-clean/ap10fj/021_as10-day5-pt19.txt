Beautiful. It throttled up to 20 per cent. Thrust chamber pressure went down to 20 per cent, but the throttle profile looked good.
I've go got some updates on there, I've got to copy down, Tom.
OK.
The first one is - What does it say on there?
I show you in a 61.2 by 9.22 [nautical miles, 113.3 x 17.1 km].
Beautiful.
Beautiful, John. Beautiful.
I've got to copy this thing right here. 100 degrees East at 33:31.
[Garble] are you guys [garble] down in there?
I can tell, José. We're just going to be hot to get clearance around the other side for a final approach, but we're coming down, baby.
These are 10-minute hacks? Or 90 minute - They've got to be 10 minute hacks, not 10 second hacks.
Yes, yes, yes.
Alright. Take that.
Tell you what let's do. Let's go ahead and load the phasing burn in unless we have an update for it. He hasn't given us an update has he?
No, call up 30 and let's load it in.
OK. So what's the time of it? I'll take it, Gene-o.
Shit.
You got it right here, babe?
Yes. Plus...
100:58:25.20.
OK. Proceed.
Holy smoke!
What?
[Garble] down below the horizon.
Yes, I believe it.
How much has that changed?
5 seconds.
OK.
It's going to put us in a 191.8 by 11.6 [nautical miles, 355.2 x 21.4 km].
OK.
Oh, shit!
[Garble] tracking you guys.
OK, John.
[Garble] fantastic.
Baby. Oh, God! It'd be worthwhile to take some pictures right here.
I can see the whole LM.
Whoa, we're dropping down, Gene-o.
You bet your life we're dropping down.
The landing site is at 10:30, Tom.
10:30.
You went P - through P30, huh?
Yes. We're all loaded.
Good.
Phasing at 47; we pitch down 90 degrees.
Right with it.
To PDI.
OK, at minus 40, yaw left 180? Right?
Minus 47, we pitch down 90. And at 42, we yaw left 180.
Beautiful. Look at those bears.
OK, that's 40...
Where's my Hasselblad again? [Laughter.]
Take them, babe, while you're coming down here.
This Velcro doesn't hold anything.
Aw, shit!
That's the problem?
Everything I turn around, the Velcro won't hold the Hasselblad.
Well, babe, you can't - It's not in there?
No, I've got a mag. Do you have it over there?
No, you were shooting John.
Yes.
This Velcro isn't worth a tinker's dam. There's no telling where it is now, babe. We got to find that before we go over that landing site. Look down on the deck.
No. Oh, here it is. Way back here. Got it. Got it. Got it.
They can take this damn Velcro and give it back to - whoever thought they invented this kind of Velcro.
OK. Coming down here we should be on black and white - f:4 at 250.
That's right.
f:4 at 250?
f:4 at 250th.
You know, this place is starting to look at home.
Yes.
What are you taking, 6?
Huh? I'm taking these at 6, and then I'm going to - I got to pick up this landing site at 33 min - 34 minutes when you roll back again.
Some of those little bitty bears have black stuff in them.
John, are you still reading us?
Loud and clear.
OK. I just - you know, when I don't hear from you, I begin to wonder.
I tell you, babe, we's getting down among dem.
Yes. I guess you're about straight under me now - 14 miles.
I know why the AGS didn't work. That was my fault, babe. I didn't set it up for external Delta-V, but we got a good perigee out of it - 8.6.
Rendezvous...
That was my fault.
Oh, shit. Go ahead
There's what I call Jack's crater. Nice little volcano that I shot yesterday. It really stands out.
Do I get a Verb - OK, we're synced. I want to Proceed out of here and get a Verb 82 - Verb 83.
Yes. Good idea.
Mark.
Do you know where the hell we really are, Tom?
No, I've got no idea, babe, right now.
Hey, I don't mean that way. What's this big - coming up on 50 minutes. I don't know what that big mother is there, but you're going to pitch around here anyway at 47, aren't you?
Yep.
There's 329. That's pretty close. Where's Hermann's site. Is this Gene-o's?
Man, that's the prettiest volcanism I've seen..
Hey, here's crater IX right here, I'll bet.
Yes.
Right here.
Yes, we're coming up to crater IX. José, we're coming up to crater IX, I think. We'll be going straight across it.
Roger.
Maybe you could tell us better where we are, babe.
We're going right across old number IX. Sure are.
Things are starting to move faster, John.
OK, Tom, all our - everything's looking good there, so far.
You know, instead of going there and yawing over 180, let's take some strips here. See, instead of yaw - phasing? Yaw left.
Yes. and I would...
Screw it! We're just going to stay here and take some photo stripping instead of - John?
Yes?
OK. Instead of yawing left and yawing right, I'm just going to stay here and take some - I think it would be more interesting for the whole thing just to take strip maps here.
I think you're right.
I'll buy that.
How about that, Gene-o?
The important film we want to get is down below, babe.
Hallelujah.
[Garble] be coming upside down.
Yeah.
Man, look at those craters!
Tom, give me that when you get a chance.
You got it, babe.
Look at that big one.
That's what I'm looking at.
My monocular's.
Hey, when I can't see the horizon, Tom, I get the feeling like we're in a dive bombing run.
Yeah.
OK, at 47 minutes - OK, you're going to stay at this attitude. That's fine.
Did you ever call up Verb 83?
Yep. You're all set.
I wanted to check it against the AGS. Let me look at it again.
Hey, there are some huge boulders.
You've got some?
You're damn right!
Look at those bastards down in that crater.
Right here?
Yes, that big deep one, right down below here.
Let me look at them. Let me look at that- let me look at this one here. I - I just took a picture of it.
That hole right down below us there.
Oh, you bet your ass there's some huge boulders down there.
Tremendous boulders.
Man, there are, Tom.
Hey, John, with that monocular, you can really see some boulders now, babe.
You know, the surface around it looks fairly good, though.
Yeah.
Here you go. You want this back?
You want the Hasselblad?
Yes, I'll take pictures of it.
Wish I could have got right down in that - right down in among those boulders - I tell you, there's some boulders down there, babe. Are we yaw a little?
Yeah, just a little bit.
Look at this cliff there, Tom, right in front of us.
Yes. There's a cliff there that's at least two or three thousand feet (600 meters or 900 meters) tall.
Oh, hell, yes. At least...
Hey, you guys are really out there now.
Oh, you know it, babe.
Holy smoley, John. This is incredible!
[Garble].
Yes. You thought we were close at 60 miles!
I still think we're [garble]. Does the terrain seem any different color down close to you?
No, I don't think so.
With the monocular, you can see some stuff.
But I'll tell you, there's some good sized boulders on the sides of these craters. Some of them are very obviously impact. But then there are some others that - look...
[Garble].
They got to be - they got to be - volcanic.
Time hack at 100 - 113:21.
John, do you know where we are? What we're over?
No, I lost you, I gave it to the Auto optics and it screwed up and I lost you.
Oh, OK. Because I'm going to tell you when I think we're about over Neper, because we've got to photograph that area coming down.
OK.
Tom, you want this over there?
Yep.
(Cough) Get me that thing.
You've got it.
Oh, look at that bear. Here's an old one. Hey here's - Gene-o - there's...
What are you looking at?
Son of a bitch! I don't know.
Holy smoley! Hey, look at that black thing in the bottom. Let me see what it is.
Look at all those black things. Hey, John, I got something that's really standing out here-like-oh gee, can you ever see it! The monocular, Gene-o, the monocular.
What are they?
Alright. That's a fantastic crater. I don't know where that is...
Let me look at it. Oops. Let me look at it.
They're big boulders, John. Gigantic! We're looking straight down.
Gee, I'm really getting vertigo here.
Yes, it's like - like that rendezvous from above, Tom, when we were looking straight down at the mother.
I nearly lost him - lost him in the light. I need to slant up some more.
OK. We're coming up on 43 minutes.
Are you in Orb Rate? No, you're in Inertial, aren't you?
I'm Inertial. Need to be pitched up more.
Your ball isn't moving. Is it?
Yeah, it is. Sure it is.
OK.
Your's is moving, isn't it?
Yes. We want to be seeing 180 upside down when we come into Neper here.
I pitched over too far. What I wanted to see, I didn't get.
This camera is getting red hot.
OK, babe, at 34 minutes, we want to be pitched up, because we will be approaching into the Neper area where we want to get - this - see, Neper here's at 34 minutes - we'll be right in here. We want to start looking - be seeing Neper coming over the horizon.
Yes. (Cough)
Look at that [garble] volcanic as the dickens. Let me have the Hasselblad.
Let me see that a minute.
You've got it.
Yes. There are a lot of - a lot of things got to be volcanic, babe.
And there's boulders down in those holes. Look at that new one.
Now, that's all black in the bottom.
Yes. That's black.
That little - that little crater with the fresh - you know, everything being fresh, it appears to me that the top of the soil - the soil is bleached by the Sun.
Yeah.
There's one.
There is a fresh - and look at the boulders on the side of that one.
You got it - got it..
Give me that camera, babe.
OK. I got some - here.
OK.
Here. Where is the monocular?
There it is.
Oh the 250 (mm lens) right here would have gotten something.
Oh, look at those boulders!
Aren't they fantastic?
40 minutes, babe. At 34, we ought to start coming into the Neper area.
Now look at that one. The way those cliffs are so sheer. There's black underneath them, and when these fresh craters come out, there's - it's all white soil.
Yes. Here's one that's coming right there.
Oh, beautiful.
It's black. A landslide and there's a boulder so damn big you can't believe it.
Let me see. Trade you. Here.
There's a little crater on the rim of this one, and there's boulders laying halfway down.
You can see where the volcanism started, and it rolled out there.
Yes, there are.
A lot of impact craters. You know, this planet must have been beaten to death at one time.
Oh, you know it.
Must have been beat to death. OK, Tom, we're coming down to 34 minutes, and that's where we're going to start picking up - Neper ought to be coming over the horizon at 29:31. We ought to be coming over the be right over Neper.
OK. Landing Radar - Landing Radar circuit breaker Closed at 22 minutes.
OK, we're ahead of time. We don't - we're in good shape right now.
There's boulders in every one of those little - little craters and on - on the ridges.
Yes. That's on the new craters - even a few of the old ones have them right down at the bottom.
And the boulders are black. They're black...
They look like they're a mare.
...and yet - and yet the stuff that comes out of the new craters is white.
White, but there's black around them.
Yes. And there are some pretty sharp cliffs. Some of these seem to be windblown down, but there are some awful sharp cliffs. What a place! You know, it almost looks like this is a painting. Someone took a painting of something.
Yes.
Hey, John, this is really a great speed at which to go over the ground, I'll tell you.
Yeah man.
Oh, here's one that tossed boulders out of it.
You've got it?
Yep. It tossed boulders right out of the stuff.
Look at that mother.
See it? Right there. You can see it.
Yes. Yes.
This little one right here tossed boulders right out of the son of a gun. Still a bunch in there.
OK. Neper's got to be coming up there pretty soon. We're at 36.
This is where G (G mission-Apollo 11) wants to do their altitude - run here.
Yes. You could track. You can track here - no problems.
I just going to keep - but we're going so slow, I'm going to stay at 6 frames a second, Tom.
Yes. Oh man. Oh, beautiful. Hey, I could even see a boulder for at least 20 miles [37 km] ahead. In that one crater right on your left, Gene-o.
Yes. Yes. Oh, look at one, way up. Let me take a look.
Yes. It's got a big black one right down in the bottom of it.
Yep. I can - you're right!
Talk about a boulder! That thing is big enough to - to crush a couple of houses.
They're lying all down the side and there's no - there is no little rim crater on it, either. They're just lying on the side.
Shoot a picture of that one - that white one coming up right. in front of you.
OK.
You can see...
Here you go.
...where the white ran down.
We got to be coming somewhere near where Neper is going to be up there, pretty soon, and the Smythe Sea.
Tom, look at the boulder on the edge of that one. Quick, look over here - way over there. Look at that black one, way - See it? See it?
Oh yes.
Look at that! Look at that. I don't know why I'm fascinated with boulders, but son of a gun - those black things stand out. Give me the monocular on that one.
At first I thought it was shadow on it, but it sure isn't, because we're looking - coming down right through the...
OK. At 33:31, we're going to coming up on 269 and 192 and Jansky.
Houston, Charlie Brown. Over.
Roger. Reading you five-by, Charlie Brown.
I need to get local vertical.
Houston, Charlie Brown. Over.
Roger. Reading you five-by, Charlie Brown. Over.
Houston, Charlie Brown. Over.
Charlie Brown, Houston. I'm reading you five-by.
Leave 64 run for a minute, Tom.
Can you pitch us up a little bit to get a better view of the...
Houston, Houston, Charlie Brown, Over.
...better view of the...
Houston, Houston, Charlie Brown. How do you read high gain? Over.
I'm all locked up on them, Tom, but I just don't read them.
Okay. we're not locked up yet, John.
Charlie Brown, Houston, Over.
Roger. Read you loud and clear. Snoopy was Go for DOI.
Roger. Great. Sounds great. We copy.
...It was a good burn, he's in a 61.2 by 9.2 [nautical miles, 113.3 x 17.0 km] right now...
...nominal burn. He'll fill you in when he gets to you. But...
Look at that - look at the Earth! Look at the Earth!
Oh gee. Look at the Earth, John. Get it, get it.
Oh my God, I can't believe it! It's just...
...at 6 miles, he was doing 65 feet a second [20 m/s] on my - 6 miles [11 km] from me, he was doing 65 feet per second [20 m/s]. At 3.8 miles [7.0 km] he was doing 73 feet per second [22 m/s]. I think that confirms this burn. They are down there among the rocks...
That's beautiful.
And that color film didn't work! That makes me so mad!
John, we just had Earthrise. Fantastic. Golly, John! Tom, get that if you can.
I don't have any color film on this son of a bitch.
Try it once more, maybe it'll work.
...mumbling about the boulders and things right now.
Roger. Charlie Brown.
They just saw Earthrise. They say they are looking up, looking up at the horizon now.
Roger.
You're panning that, aren't you, Gene-o?
Yes.
Be sure to open it up for the Earth.
Open it up?
Oh, yes. Earth on that color is f:11 at 250, babe.
You mean, wider?
Well, f:11 at 250 is the Earth. f:11 at 250.
Hello Houston. Houston this is Snoopy.
Roger, Snoop. Go ahead.
We is Go, and we is down among them, Charlie.
Roger. I hear you weaving your way up the freeway. Can you give me a post-burn report? Over.
Yes. As soon as I get my breath.
It doesn't work.
OK. Our residuals. Our burn was on time. Our residuals were minus 0.1, minus 0.3 and minus 0.5. And that was the residuals for the DPS burn. We did not use the - We did not null anything out. We are at 61.2 by 9.2 [nautical miles, 113.3 x 17.0 km] and the AGS has at an 8.6.
Roger, Snoopy. We copy all the residuals, and it looks like we are all Go. Your DPS is looking good, and it's Go. Over.
Oh. Charlie. We just saw Earthrise and it's got to be magnificent.
Yeah, you can also tell Jack Schmitt...
Roger. We copy.
...that there are enough boulders around here to fill up Galveston Bay, too.
He's copying, Tom.
The only trouble is - We're stripping lots of film for him. The spacecraft is looking good and there are no problems, Charlie, except it would be nice to be around here more often.
Roger. We copy. All your systems are looking good to us. Did you get your DPS pressure back? Over.
Negative.
That's a negative, but the DPS burn was smoothed out very smooth, well when we throttled up.
Roger. We got a good - good pressures here and the DPS is Go for phasing.
Roger, Charlie.
Can you image, no color film in that thing? Huh? Yes. I ought to hit someone over the head with that -
Oops. OK. Landing Radar Test coming up.
OK. At 28 - not yet, babe.
Well, I want to get it early.
I need - Have you got them locked on? I need a Verb 83.
Verb 83?
Yes. Go call P00 and then get us a Verb 83.
Let me run through - through 30 real quick.
OK.
Snoop, Houston. There will be no update on the phasing PAD. Everything is looking really good.
OK. Good. We'll be picking up our landing radar test and taking pictures here and it is a fantastic sight. You do have different shades, of browns and grays here. And right - the volcanism there is also a pure white near the edge, and the bottom is black, and we see some large boulders that are black to blackish gray.
Roger, Snoopy. We copy.
Have we got it? What time?
OK, just wanted to check it. Go ahead.
27 50, Proceed.
Call your Verb 83.
There you are, Tom.
Here are some more boulders.
OK. We've got 10 minutes to go before we get to Taruntius G and H.
OK.
What's our elevation now?
Charlie Brown, Houston. Can you see them down there among the boulders? Over.
I saw them about 14 miles [26 km]. But then I turned this thing over to CMC to let it do an Auto maneuver and it lost them.
Roger.
I was tracking them just manually. I don't see them anymore. I'm going to let it update it with a little radar - a little range, and see if that brings it in.
Houston. This is Charlie Brown. Omni D. How do you read?
OK, go into Hover.
Roger, Charlie Brown. We copy. Out.
Are you in Hover, Tom?
OK, going to Hover.
A little early, but let's get it in.
Charlie Brown. Houston. Go ahead.
You got it?
Should be reading about 42,000 feet [12,600 meters] when she actually locks on.
There it is. babe - Oh. beautiful. How's it look?
A quarter of a degree down.
Why don't you just write it on there?
Hello, Houston, This is Snoop. It looks like this landing radar is doing real good.
Roger, Snoop, we Roger that. Over.
It looks to me we want to have a lock-on here, [garble] even early.
OK, babe. Coming on at 25 minutes...
Go - go back to P00.
And straight up ahead, you can see the gulf from the highlands over to the maria area. It's a beautiful sight. Just like you're crossing over to a black and gray sea.
There goes the landing radar.
Landing radar looks like it's locked on solid.
Roger, Snoop. Over.
I don't believe this thing's failed, do you?
You out of film?
What did that circuit breaker blew.
You've got to be kidding.
OK, T.P. 23 minutes, I'm going to - 22:30, I'm going to connect the ascent batteries. You got your land - PGNS Landing Radar breaker Closed, for sure?
Oh, yeah, yeah, baby.
OK.
Houston. I got the ascent batteries connected at this time.
Roger. We see that. Thanks, Snoop. Over.
I didn't realize there were so many things to do in such a short time.
Give me that thing, Tom, if you can?
OK.
Snoop, Houston. Your ascent batteries look good. Out.
Roger.
Charlie, we're now about where the horizon is - almost, you know, level - at times seems a little bit high. We're coming into - to a mare area 22 minutes before, before phasing right now. The craters, the new craters, seem to throw out very, very light, light, almost whitish gray by comparison to the dirtier-color whites and grays and browns. Right over the rim - there appears to be almost every fresh crater, there's visible boulders both down in it, on the sides and on the rim.
Also, Charlie, it looks like we're getting so close all you have to do is put your tail hook down and we're there. (Laughter)
Hey, Snoop. Air Force guys don't talk that way.
Well, I did fly an F4 that had one on it one time, even though it's an Air Force bird. OK. We're coming right over to the maria. And it really smooth out here, comparatively speaking.
You should be starting to see Langrenus over there, T.P.
Yes.
21 minutes.
Roger, Snoop. We have you; you should be at Taruntius very soon.
Roger.
OK, Houston. I've got them in the optics now. They're fantastic.
Hey! Great show, Charlie Brown.
OK. We're at - I don't believe we're quite up to Taruntius yet. We're in - we're in the Foaming Sea - We're past the Sea of Waves and in the Foaming Sea. And the maria gets markedly smooth and flat. There's small craters - a lot of small craters down in it, but the basic surface is extremely smooth. And it appears that the craters go down into it, rather than - than the rims come up out of it.
You can tell that this area is definitely lower than that highland area, just as the whole general area.
OK. I think right over the horizon, we've probably got Taruntius H and Taruntius G coming up. See them, Tom?
Yes, we've got them, Cernan...
OK, Snoop. Could you come up on expected surface washout? Could you comment on that? Over.
Yes. When you look straight down, there's a definite three-dimensional effect where you can't really tell the depth of craters like we could in the past. And in some cases, you're not even sure whether - whether there is depth to them except that they look a little familiar. It's a little bit hazier and glarier. It looks like we're right over a sub-solar point about now.
Boy! Are they down there among them!
Roger. Bet it looks like they're really hauling the mail.
What - what did you do?
Huh? I didn't do anything.
Oh, sorry.
Yes. We're doing it. Surprisingly enough, Charlie, it really doesn't look like we're moving too fast down here. It's a very nice pleasant pace.
Roger.
In fact, it's exactly like when - tell Deke it's like you went out and practiced the other morning in Florida, as far as the relative bearing rate, it's about the same.
Copy. Out.
Seems like we're coming up on my side on Taruntius G and I believe Tom's got his Taruntius H right there on his side. These come out of the horizon differently. They seem to come over the horizon and be much closer to you down here, than up there at 60 miles [111 km].
Shit, look at the boulders.
And, again the craters in this area, are craters that are dug out of the surface and not craters that are throwing back from the surface. They're very low, flat rims.
Snoop, you're dropping out. Your voice faded out. We're standing by.
Roger. It looks like we might be on the verge of [garble] loss of lock, here; I don't know.
Tom, I think you've either got Messier B or Secchi up there on your left in front of you. See it?
Yep.
Hello, Snoopy. If you read, Houston, we think your aerial is not tracking us too closely. Could you pick us up on the signal strength? Over.
Houston, Snoopy. From this altitude, the maria still looks fairly smooth as far as overall approach characteristics coming into it.
Snoopy, Houston said something about their signal strength or something.
Tell them again - tell me again what you want them to do there, Houston.
Roger, Snoop. We're getting data dropout. It sounds like [garble].
OK. We're coming into Apollo Ridge.
Yes.
OK. There's Secchi on my right.
Roger. We copy Apollo Ridge.
There's Secchi on my right! OK, Houston. Houston, if you read, we have Secchi on my right. We're coming into Apollo Ridge. There's the first of the - here's Apollo Rille, right out the window! Very, very easily distinguishable at this point, and it appears to be a couple of hundred feet deep.
It's rounded.
Hello, Snoop. Houston. Do you read? Can you try to tweak up the high-gain signal strength? Over.
Houston, I'm on Omni. I'm not sure whether you're reading, but we're coming over the Apollo Ridge. I just had Secchi on my right - Apollo Ridge appears to be a couple of hundred feet deep, but very smooth at the bottom. We should have the Smokey Basin right out of Tom's window, on the left.
Yep.
Are you reading, Houston?
Hello, John. Are you reading?
Loud and clear there, Gene-o.
OK. I'm on Omni, and we got good signal strength. I don't know whether they're listening, but we're over Apollo Ridge and we're just passing Smokey Basin.
Charlie Brown, Houston. If you read, have Snoopy tweak up the high gain. We're not reading him at all. Over.
Roger.
Charlie - Snoopy, Houston wants you to tweak up the high gain. They are not reading you.
We're coming into perilune now.
Snoop, this is Charlie Brown. Over.
OK, they should have it now. OK. We just passed Mount Marilyn. We're losing high-gain lock. We can't hold them.
Houston, Snoopy said they can't hold you on the high gain.
Roger. Stand by.
Boulders all over the place. OK, You got it?
Houston, we're on Omni and we just passed Mount Marilyn. As a matter of fact, there's Weatherford Crater, I believe, right in here.
Yes. Where we ought...
What's the time, babe? We're at 14:40. OK. And here - we just...
...there's Teresa Ridge - Right there! We're right over it!
OK, T.P. We're coming up on the Bear Mountain. It's right ahead of us. And you should have Maskelyne A. Do you have a big crater, Maskelyne A, right there, right on the edge of our - right in front of you, down straight in front of you on the left?
Could they have...
We have Lonesome Mesa right here.
Is this Maskelyne A?
Houston, I don't know whether you read or not, but that's the best we can do.
Snoop, we read you. Standing by.
They are still transmitting to you, Houston - but - they're reading you, Snoopy, and they're standing by.
OK. We're abeam of - we're abeam of Site 1. Tom, give me that a minute. let me see if I can take a couple of pictures.
And I've got Censorinus A out here. Hey, let me - I've got Censorinus A, right here, bigger than shit.
Hey, I tell you, we are low! We are close, babe! This is, like, it! And it really looks pretty smooth down there, surprisingly enough.
Censorinus A has huge boulders all around the rim of it, falling on the inside and outside.
OK. I've got Maskelyne out here off my right side. We are coming up on Boot Hill which is very easy to distinguish, and Maskelyne. And I see the craters that are going to lead us right into the - right into the landing site.
We've got Duke Island on the left, just past Boot Hill and we are coming up - I've got Wash Basin just off my right arm - very easily distinguishable.
Tom, ought to have Sidewinder Rille coming up on the left - Tom, give me that...
Here it comes.
...get Maskelyne.
What time did we pitch over, 11:40?
Yeah.
OK. I've got Diamondback. Diamondback Rille is very easy to see. These rilles look like they may be as much as a couple of hundred feet deep and very smooth. The surface actually looks very smooth, like a very wet clay, but smooth with the exception of the bigger craters.
Oh, Tom, let me get a picture of those rilles! Diamondback.
Here. Sidewinder Rille is round along the edges. It is flat under, and smooth in the bottom. The ridges are definitely rounded, and it doesn't look like the sides are upturned. OK. I've got Moltke up here on the left and we are coming into the site.
OK. The best description I can give you of these rilles is of a dry - a dry riverbed out in New Mexico or Arizona someplace.
Hold it, go VOX. OK. Here we are coming up on the site [garble] Moltke on the left.
[Garble] Maskelyne G [garble].
...there's plenty of holes there, but there are a few smooth places.
There's Sabine. OK. We just went over crater number 12, we've got the landing site, Tom's got Moltke right out his left - right. Take a picture of that, babe.
OK.
... almost like you could reach out and touch Moltke, and we're going just right over the landing site right this moment, and it's - a lot of - a lot of rounded-off craters, a few fresh ones, but basically, it looks pretty smooth, like a gummy grayish sand.
OK. My camera failed, I took so many pictures. There's still lots of small craters down there, but I'd say you have about 30 percent of the area that looks free. About 30 per cent. So if you've got Hover time, you can probably make it.
Snoop, Houston, Request Downvoice Backup. Over.
Snoopy, Houston wants you to go to Downvoice Backup. Over.
...I am, John, I'm in Downvoice Backup.
OK.
We're just going over the landing site right now, and we should be coming up on Ritter - Sabine and Ritter and then Schmitt.
OK, here is US 1. US 1 has got a rounded side, and it looks like the whole thing is slumped down an even amount, like it is a huge graben.
Man, that must be - Tom, that must be seven, that must be a thousand feet wide.
Yes. US 1 is a good - oh, almost a good mile - a thousand feet to a mile wide - even a couple thousand feet to a mile wide. And the whole thing is slumped down. And the plain is still pretty pock-marked with craters, but it looks like you could be able to set down there.
We're going to phasing attitude.
OK.
OK.
Goddamn film pack failed. I'm so fed up with this stuff failing.
Hey. Gene-o, what's the phasing attitude?
OK.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Over.
Go ahead. Over.
OK. Let me...
Roger. We had a complete data dropout with Snoopy...
...I read you loud and clear.
OK. Roger. Pass it on: we got 9 minutes till burn; get in the attitude; and they're Go for phasing. Over.
I'm starting this right now, Tom.
Roger. Snoopy, Houston says you're Go for phasing. Got about 8½ minutes now. Want to get you in the attitude.
Snoop, Charlie Brown. Do you read?
Oh, look at this!
You know this god-damned film pack failed on me?
My Hasselblad just failed!
Oh, I tell you, babe, that's something. OK.
Oh! Look at that!
Except I don't have any more [garble].
What happened to my control systems?
I don't know. Why?
Snoop, Houston. We're reading you about three-by now...
...I just got a VHF [garble].
We're counting 8 minutes to the burn. Over.
Roger. We're going to phasing attitude.
Roger. And you're Go for the burn.
Yes, You can't imagine the position we can see these things in, pitched way down like this. It looks like we're not very far above them. It's fantastic.
OK, babe. You might try and get your helmets and gloves on. I went through P30, and we're all good there again.
What is your attitude, babe? Boy, it's getting dark. OK, I thought we were pointing up in the air.
Let's hurry up and get this burn completed.
Son of a bitch.
We has been down among them, babe!
We got to start doing that earlier.
Tom, are you reading me?
I'm reading you. Do you read me?
Yeah.
OK. Help -
OK, you guys. Give it to them.
OK. You can go into 40.
OK.
It's OK. Verb 06, Noun - minus 16710 and minus...
Houston, Charlie Brown. They're going into a P40 now.
Roger. We copy them, Charlie Brown. Thanks so much.
Roger.
Plus 16710.
Plus 167.10...
OK. [Garble].
...minus 58.0.
OK.
Proceed. Yes. We'll do an Auto maneuver.
Verb 70 - OK, you should have called a Verb 78 in there, babe.
OK.
OK. Four minute check...
And, Tom, the AGS is good for a takeover. The AGS is good for a takeover.
OK.
OK. Let me open and close this breaker.
OK.
OK T.P. We've got to get something out of this burn. Engine Gimbal, Enable.
Engine Gimbal Enable.
Throttle Min.
Throttle's coming to Min.
Throttle Control, Auto.
Throttle Control is Auto.
Manual Throttle, Commander.
Go.
Balance Couple, On.
Go.
Descent Engine Override Command, Off.
Go.
Engine pushbuttons all Reset?
Yep.
Abort pushbuttons all Reset.
OK
OK, Stab/Control: DECA Power, Closed; and AELD Closed.
OK. Stab/Control: DECA Power Closed and AELD Closed.
OK. EPS Inverter number 2 Closed.
That's over there.
No, it isn't!
EPS Inverter number 2?
EPS Inverter number 1 Closed; I'm sorry. You got it?
OK.
You got it?
Yes.
OK. Descent Engine Override coming Closed? AELD coming Closed. Abort Stage coming Closed.
OK, Tom, if Delta-V to go is less than five (fps) (1.5 m/s), we'll RCS it to zero, 3 Max. If Delta-V to go is less than 25 (fps) (7.6 m/s) but greater than 5 (fps) (1.5 m/s), we've got to stage in RCS to zero.
Yes.
If Delta-V to go is greater than 25 (fps) (7.6 m/s) we got to stage and APS to zero. OK?
Right.
Now if we have to go to AGS, or APS, I've got the staging procedures and everything right here.
Yep.
After - after burning - if we stage, we'll stage it and burn it in AGS and go.
OK.
If we burn the ascent engine, we'll burn it in AGS.
2 minutes.
Have you got your landing radar on?
Landing radar is still on.
You got to pull that breaker.
No. It stays on until after this. We do a Verb 79 - afterwards.
Alright.
Two minutes.
From final Proceed. We're there. Enter.
OK, 1:46 to go. We have phasing of 176 feet per second (53.6 m/s). OK. 1:30, Gene-o.
OK, babe, 1:14 to go.
Yep
John, we'll go on VOX, so you can read it.
John, how do you read?
Loud and clear.
We are being cut out, but I assume it's loud and clear.
OK, Tom. Coming up on 35 seconds: Engine Arm Descent? Deadband Min. You are in AGS. A-OK. Go to Auto on the AGS. There's your AGS needle. AGS attitude's is looking good.
DSKY blanks; hit the Proceed at 5 seconds.
OK. Babe, the AGS is looking good, there is your AGS attitude...
We'll trim the...
You're in good shape.
Standing by to start it.
OK, and I'll trim out the burn.
OK, here we go for 26 seconds.
The total burn time is ...
40.
40 seconds.
OK, stand by to proceed.
OK. I'm ready.
... ullage.
Flashing 99.
Proceed.
99, Proceed. There's ullage.
OK, throttle's up. That's OK. Let it go. We're burning. OK.
OK. We're burning, John; we're burning!
Go to throttle up.
Snoop, Houston. We copy.
It's the Gimbal light. Forget about it, babe. We've got an Engine Gimbal light, but everything is good.
We're still burning.
Still burning, 149 (fps) (45.4 m/s) to go.
26. Ohhh.
OK. Throttling up. 127 (fps) (38.7 m/s) to go.
How's the attitudes?
107 (fps) (32.6 m/s) to go.
Good.
86 (fps, 26.2 m/s) to go. 40 (fps, 12 m/s) to go, 40 (fps), 20 (fps, 6 m/s) to go.
Oh, brother.
Shutdown!
DECA Power off.
OK, Tom. 1.5 feet per second (0.45 m/s). Let me null it out. Let's go to AGS Attitude Hold.
OK. OK, we'll go to AGS...
AGS Attitude Hold.
OK. Go. Hold it. Something's wrong here.
We're Min Deadband. That's good. Let it go, right here. That's good.
OK good we're done. That's got it.
That's got it, babe.
OK.
Let me get those.
I'm going to Wide Deadband.
Plus two. minus point - plus 0.2, minus 0.5, and minus 0.9. The burn is good, John.
Roger. I understand. The burn is good.
And Snoop, Houston. We copy your residuals. Over.
Roger.
Looked real good and the burn was steady, we had the Descent Quantity light on twice, we had the Engine Gimbal light on, the Master Warning and all those good things, but we just pressed right on. Over.
Roger. We copy.
OK. Verb 82, Enter.
OK, Tommy. OK. Houston, we are in a 190.8 by 11.8 [nautical miles, 353.4 x 21.8 km].
Roger. We copy.
OK, Tom. Verify your Engine Arm Off.
Yes, Engine Arm, Off.
Prop Quantity, Off.
Prop Quantity coming Off.
OK, babe. You can - Let me take my helmet and gloves off.
Let me get the DECA Gimbal open. Let's get a Verb 79.
I got it.
And we'll get the Landing Radar.
Snoop, Houston. We missed the Verb 79.
Roger. Just went in.
OK. We got it. Thanks, Tom.
How's the pressure doing? Oh, I guess it's just does.
Hey, Snoop, Houston. The comm is really great and we got all our data now. During the good part though, boy you were way down in the mud, but everything is copacetic now. Over.
Charlie. I fought with the S-band antenna to get it for you, but it's the best I could do and I got the strongest strength Omni when we were down there. And then after we passed, I gave S-band another try and we came in good, because I thought you'd want to see the burn.
We appreciate it. Thanks much, Snoop. It looked great.
And, Houston, this is Snoopy. You'd like to know that we have taken so many pictures that both cameras have failed on us. Over.
Roger, we copy.
OK, Tom, we want to do some tracking. You got your - you got this yaw maneuver, put your Rendezvous Radar breaker In.
Yes. OK. OK.
You got your Rendezvous breaker In?
Yep.
OK. And you got to - go to 120 upside down. And you're probably in - Oh, you're in inertial now, aren't you?
Yes, that's where I want to be.
And here's where the AGS thinks it is Tom.
The AGS needles - AGS needles give you a hack on where it is. Yaw 180 and pitch down 90, I know that. OK Tom. Clean up your breaker panel: PGNS Landing Radar Opened?
Yep.
Stab/Control: DECA Power open.
Yep.
AELD, Open?
Yep.
Inverter number 1 Open?
Yep.
OK, my Descent Engine Override is coming Open. My AELD is coming Open. My Abort Stage is coming Open, and I am going to disconnect the batteries. Stand by. OK. That one's above?
Yep.
Pretty good bird, you know it?
Yeah.
OK, how about RCS? What have we got quantity-wise? 92 and 82 (per cent in system A and B).
Yes, we've been hosing it out. These - these needles aren't nulled. They get all that tracking down there and...
Fine, that's no problem, babe. Piece of cake. Waiting for - to get to that attitude and we'll pick up P20 and we'll start marking.
Yes.
Looking at 120 upside down.
Charlie Brown, Houston. We have a backup insertion PAD if you are ready to copy. Over.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger, Charlie Brown.
... manual
Go ahead.
We're not near it there.
Roger, Charlie Brown, backup insertion: SPS, G&N: NA down to Noun 33, Noun 33 is 102:58:01.00, plus 0170.0, plus all balls, minus 0071.0, 180, 262, 002, NA down to Delta-VC, and the Delta-VC is 0171.8. Rest of the PAD is NA. Your ullage is four jets, 10 seconds. Got a CSI time: a 103:44:00, TPI time 105:33:00, with an N equal to 1. Over.
...you didn't give me AGS.
I gave you AGS - AGS needles right here, Tom.
Yes. OK.
Good. Leave it there.
Where the AGS thinks it is.
Yes. Put it back there so I can...
OK. As long as you don't go to Mode Control, you're alright. You can leave it in there.
Oh, yeah. Not about to.
That's exactly what we called for.
There he is.
OK. See if you can get them...
I got him in the reflected.
Just get the signals. You got your Radar breakers in?
Roger. SPS, G&N: not applicable down to time of burn: 102:58:01.00, plus 0170.0, plus all balls, minus 071.00, 180, 262, 002, Delta-VC 07 - 0171.8, four jets, 10 seconds. CSI: 103:44:00, TPI 105:33:00, N equals 1.
I've got the AC.
See if you can get him.
Yes, it's on AGS on your ball, babe.
There it goes.
Good readback, Charlie Brown.
As soon as you get him, go to LGC and we'll...
OK.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Confirm Delta-VC and Noun 81: minus 00710.
Here it comes.
Want to try and let P20 do it? Let's let P20 try it. Go to LGC.
OK. Hang on. This thing should be boresighted in.
Minus two balls, 710.
It's close enough. Why don't you try and let P20 try it?
OK. Fine. You have been breaking up a little bit, John, we missed one of those zeros.
José, are you pitched up?
That's affirm, I'll get there.
Yeah, he didn't pitch up far enough.
I'm not pitched up; I'm in tracking attitude right now.
Why don't you go to LGC, and let him try it, babe? Go ahead.
Hey, John. Babe, you may have to go down and reset that rendezvous radar transponder. Over.
There it comes. Hold it, John. We're getting it.
(Coughing)
You alright?
Yes. I got some insulation.
OK, there's an update, babe. It's alright.
You want to try...
Holy smoley. Look at that.
Uh-oh..
Holy shit!
Hello, Houston. Snoopy.
Go ahead, Snoopy. Over.
Did you take a look at 06 49 and see what we got there?
Roger. We're looking at it. Stand by.
The first one was a small number: 0.4 and zero.
Did we put it - no, not - don't let that son of a bitch update the vector. We've got a Verb 95 in it.
Roger, copy. 0.4 and zero on the first. It looks like big numbers now.
It's updating his state vector anyway.
Snoop, Houston. While we're looking at this, would you - are you ready to copy an insertion PAD? Over.
That's affirmative. I am, and I'd also like to give - you give me an update on AOS and sunrise.
Roger. Stand by. Your insertion PAD: TIG, starting with TIG - 102:55:01.40, Minus 01832, plus all balls, minus 0123.5. Delta-VR is 02209, 015, minus - correction, roll is 180, 233, minus 01818, plus all balls, minus 01255, rest of the PAD is NA. Standing by for your readback. Over.
OK. You got any word on that Noun 49? We're losing some tracking time we'd like to try out.
Roger. Stand by. We want you to reject that mark with the big numbers, and stand by on the others.
No, not Verb 49, babe.
Snoop, Houston. We have LOS time for you of 101:37.
Oh.
God damn! I don't know what that did.
I'm sorry ...
Sunrise time of 101:40. Over,
OK. I got it. I don't know what - it'll be right here. It's right here.
And, how's the P20 doing now? Is it taking good Marks?
"Start crew defined maneuver". We don't have any. We don't have any...
Yes it looks like it is.
We're OK...
We just got our second. Mark and, wait a minute.
It doesn't mean a thing.
Yes. It looked good. It's three-tenths of a foot per second (0.1 m/s).
That's the Automaneuver. We're OK.
And I'll read the PAD back if you'd like.
Houston, are you ready for the PAD?
Roger. Go.
OK. Insertion is 102:55:01.40, minus 01832, plus all balls, minus 01235. 02209, 015, 180, 233, minus 01818, plus all balls, minus 01255 and that's it.
Roger. That was a good readback.
I want to do some Z-axis tracking.
Instead of 82.5 (degrees) down, your attitude is going to be changed, Tom. We're 123.5 down.
OK. See how the Z-axis tracks goes.
Snoop, Houston. We're satisfied...
What happened?
...with the way the rendezvous radar is updating the state vector in P20 now. Over.
Z axis...
OK, Charlie. Thank you.
That's Z axis track.
It's like moving a garbage can around.
Houston, Apollo 10. The Z-axis tracked and now looks real good and real solid.
Roger, Snoop. It looks good to us. Your range is coming right in there.
Roger.
I'm only going to take one more mark, Tom, and then go into a P52.
OK. Let's see what it is. Noun 49, Enter. See what we got there. Beautiful.
That's good. Find out where that last mark is, so we can terminate, and go into - I'll get one more, and get out of there.
OK. I'm tracking you guys optically. It's really working good.
Have you got our flashing light, John?
Yes, it's beautiful.
Houston, just for information, every time we lose track with the S-band antenna it happened and it happens to bang into the stops, it pops the S-band antenna circuit breaker on 16. It's done that about three times...
Roger.
...but it appears to recover all right.
Roger. Snoop, Houston. That's a normal..
[Garble] I'm going Omni antennas at this time.
Roger. We copy on the Omnis, and that's normal indication for the steerable: when it goes into the stops it will pop that breaker.
Down Voice Backup. That's Off; that's Off. OK, you got a hot mike, Tom
OK.
OK, let's go to Verb 41, Noun 72. Enter. Plus 00000, Enter, plus 28300, Enter. See whether it's going.
Radar is driving. Looks good.
Alright. Pull your breakers.
Alright. Rendezvous Radar, DC, PGNS, Open. Rendezvous Radar, AC Bus A, Open.
Got your AOT Lamp breaker Closed?
AOT Lamp, Closed. Go.
And we call for Acrux at this point.
OK. Let me look at it. We're really using the fuel up on these maneuvers.
What's that look like to you?
OK. Roll is 211. That isn't bad. Pitch - that's OK. Go to it? Auto. Proceed.
Boy, it doesn't waste any time, does it?
This thing feels like a big garbage can.
I tell you, it really does. Like it's banging against your head.
OK, I've got a reticle. That's a start.
Oh, there's the Earth.
(Cough) You got the Earth again?
Right there.
Beautiful.
Oh, magnificent, Charlie, or Joe, or Tom. (Laughter) God dang that's unbelievable, isn't it?
Yep.
Looks like it's hanging out there on a string where you can touch it. Where the hell are we going?
Go to Acrux. When you're there, you're there.
Oh, man are we there. This alignment is so good, it's - it's pathetic.
OK. You ready? We're going to go to...
Oh, yeah, that's good. Don't even trim it.
OK, I'm going to go to PGNS and Pulse?
Yes.
There. Proceed.
PGNS and Pulse.
I'm going to see what...
Did you guys turn off your tracking light?
No. Tell him we've maneuvered.
OK. I guess you maneuvered, because I don't see you.
We've just maneuvered to start tracking Acrux. Over.
OK.
The reticle on this thing is really bad. It won't stand it.
Snoop, Houston. We read you about three-by. Over.
Roger, Houston. This is Snoopy. We're starting to mark on Acrux now for our P52. Over.
There's a Y, Tom.
Roger, Tom. We copy in the P52. Over.
Yep.
Stand by, Tom. Go.
Roger.
OK.
OK.
Batteries went dead.
Batteries what?
On the Hasselblad. Went dead.
I had a film pack that jammed!
Then the batteries went dead (laughter). Oh, well.
Ready to mark what? Y.
Mark Y.
Mark Y, again.
Mark Y.
Mark Y, again.
Mark Y.
Boy, no wonder John's going blind.
Either one?
Either one.
Snoopy, Houston. To improve the comm, we'd like you to go to S-Band to Voice and S-Band ranging, Off. Over.
Roger. S-Band-Voice; S-Band Ranging, Off. Over.
OK.
And Charlie Brown, Houston. When you lose the high gain, then go to Omni Delta. Over.
That's what it calls for, right here.
Roger. Omni Delta.
How does that look to you? We're still in AGS by the way, babe.
It looks OK.
OK. Ready?
Ready? Go.
It's going to go this way.
Yes.
There it is, bigger than love.
Coming in, too.
Tom, that alignment we had; you know where the star is? The alignment we had is under the cross-hairs.
Is that right?
Under the cross hairs. That alignment we had was so good.
They might want to change the antennas since we moved, I don't know.
I read you, Snoop.
Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy. How are you reading now?
Roger, Tom. You're about three-by now. A little bit better. Over.
Roger. Charlie, I'm reading you loud and clear now. Over.
Roger, We - we have low bit rate, that's all, Snoop. When you get through your P52, we'd like your torquing angles.
Roger. And on the first Automaneuver to the star, Houston - to Acrux - it put the reticle right on the very center of the star there. So it looks like our first alignment was beautiful.
Roger, Snoop. We copy. Over.
And we're now marking on Antares.
Roger, Snoop. Out.
You know, John could really be going blind by the time he finishes this flight, after doing all this stuff.
Yes.
Mark either, Tom.
Either one.
Did you guys see that mark I just bought?
Hello, Charlie Brown. Snoopy. Were you calling?
No. I was talking to Houston.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Go ahead. Reading you about three-by. Over.
Roger. Did you see that Mark I just bought? With the big Delta-V and everything? Did you all read the data?
Charlie Brown, Houston. Say again. You're unreadable.
Roger. I say again. Do you all read what I'm doing?
Roger. We see you're in P20. Over.
Program alarm. Too many marks? Verb 5.
I probably marked on the same thing twice. What's that say?
Roger. I just bought a rather large optics mark and it brought it right back up there into the scope here.
More than five marks see. Well I figure you were marking like mad here.
OK, I guess maybe that's right.
I got to Reset. Key Release.
OK. Proceed.
And Proceed.
Beautiful.
OK, you want to write those down, or you want me to?
I'll get them.
Houston, the star angle difference is 4 balls 2. Houston, are you reading?
Roger. Go ahead. 4 balls 2 on the star angle difference. How about the torquing angles?
OK. Minus 00169, plus 00050, plus 3 balls 66.
Roger. We copy, Snoop. Out.
Oh, hell. Let's do a real quick check here.
What do you want? You want to check the COAS?
Yes. Do you want to check the COAS?
Check the COAS, position 5.
What star, have you got out in front of you?
I've got the Earth. Go get An - what about Antares? What did you just mark on? Antares?
Yes. I just marked on Antares.
What kind of range you got, Tom? About 200 miles [370 km]?
Let's take it up to it. Ready?
Wait a minute. Did I do that right?
No, no, no.
Why no, no, no?
Call 52 again.
Give it approximate range.
Charlie Brown, Houston - Charlie Brown, Houston. We are satisfied with your P20. Your NAV's looking good to us. Over.
Roger. Looks good to me too.
And, John, you are barely readable, about two by. Stand by. We might have an antenna problem.
Roger. We got one. I'll go to Omni D.
Where'd that angle come from?
Forget it, ignore it, ignore it.
It shouldn't be in there; I'll try to zero it.
Zero it.
Charlie Brown, Houston.
Houston, Charlie Brown. How do you read?
Auto.
We are looking right up your tailpipe there, and your comm is pretty bad. Did you copy, Charlie Brown?
Ready?
We are looking up your tailpipe, the comm is pretty bad.
Yes.
Houston, Charlie Brown. Omni D. How do you read?
Snoopy, go ahead.
Charlie Brown. Houston. Go ahead.
You got it?
Yes. [Garble]. Hold on now, let's do 1.
There it is, babe - oh, beautiful. How's that look?
A quarter of a degree down.
Why don't you just write it on there?
Charlie Brown, Houston. We'll have LOS in 101:36.
Oh, I'll make it a third.
We'll see you over the hill at 102:22. And, Snoop, LOS for you, 101 - correction, 101:37, AOS 102:25. Over.
If you're satisfied. terminate it.
Go - go back to P00.
Call it again, just right over it. OK, Tom. Let's go to the attitude to find tracking, and we've got to track now again. At...
This is Snoopy. Roger. We got that.
We want to try and get a number of marks here. At minus 1:29, and how far are we now? The burn is at 102:55, so we're at 1:20, so we want to go find it.
Roger.
Roger, Charlie Brown and Snoop, as you are going over the hill, all the systems are Go. We're all Go here on the ground, and it's looking great. Over.
Thank you, Charlie. Snoopy's Go here. Our P52's complete. We're going to pick up P20 again.
OK. Tom. if you want to find out where it is - Want to go to the target? I've got the AGS needles for you.
Copy.
Yes, let's go to AGS.
OK.
I'm in the -
You want this in AGS?
No. I want it DAP first.
OK. now you can find out where it is. There's where it is.
Okay. I'll go. Okay, I'm in Direct. I'll go down to here.
Now on the Orb-rate ball at this time. What time is it. Tom; 101:34. And it's normally been 101:24? I guess we're about 150 miles from John. huh?
Yes. Hey, where's the food?
Hey, Charlie Brown. This is Snoop. I guess we are about 150 miles from you.
Roger.
And our P50 - our P52 is complete. We're coming over to start tracking on you.
Yes. I show you [garble] 179.22 [nautical miles, 331.9 km] [garble].
Sounds right.
Charlie Brown, this is Houston. Did you get your AOS/LOS times? Over.
Whew! How about some foodsville?
I guess so, babe. I just - I'm so sick and tired of these god-dang magazines failing. You know it?
Where's the food bag?
It's up in that two-man food bag.
I want to watch this come in.
All we got left is a roll of interior film.
Everything else is gone?
I'll have to check. I can't get the damn thing to work at all.
OK, I guess we ought to talk for the record. What we observed as we came across the mare area into the landing site, the basic area looked fairly smooth...
Actually, it looked amazingly smooth, Tom, I thought.
It looked amazingly smooth, and it looks like we have plenty of landing surface down...
I think you can land down there in and among those holes.
Yes.
This works after you jam that contact open, but you don't have time to jam a god-dang contact open.
I can't hold my - the hose is floating up, you know it?
Boy, chicken again. And that waters good now.
Got bubbles?
No. Yes, there is.
Let's see, we've got to get some tracking on this guy. We're late now.
Yes. Shit.
That's the trouble with these darn air vents.
05 55 02 - 42 [garble].
What do we have in the way of 70 millimeter film? Jack was saying we could strip the back side of that area...
The Hassel...
...on top - that Hasselblad.
...the Hasselblad went dead, babe!
The whole Hasselblad?
Just as I was - That's what I was bitching about: the Hasselblad burned out as I hit the landing site! That's why I was so fucking mad.
Are you kidding?
I'm not kidding. It's dead!
It doesn't work at all?
No.
On one of my magazines, you have to ja - Look at, even now, you got to jam it in. Look it. Light goes out - there it goes.
I'm so sick and tired of film that doesn't - that doesn't check out working beforehand.
Boy, that ascent engine is going to be a kick in the - in the ass.
There. Are you ready for it?
Wait a minute. OK, now I am. Go ahead. Do I put it in PGNS Auto and let the Z-axis track?
Yes. Let me get near it, so it doesn't...
What is it?
Put it in Auto Track, Tom, and we'll call up 20 again.
It's been looking right at it, I guess, huh?
Son of a gun, it did it again.
Oh, sh- Reject that there.
How about some fruit cocktail? Does that sound good?
I'd love some.
There's - there's a mark, Tom.
Are you guys looking directly at me? Over.
That's affirm. We're tracking on you now, John.
Roger. I'm checking my lights.
Tom, do I put it in Z-axis track here, do you know?
Go ahead, go ahead.
Or do I take it out?
Go to PGNS and Auto.
OK. PGNS?
You can track him in Z-axis.
