We've either got a hatch leak from somewhere, or it's not venting.
Let's recheck that.
Well, we're not losing pressure, John, that I can see.
[Garble] No-Go.
You want to go up there and go to Close on that valve, just to make sure it's closed?
If you want to try it go ahead. Maybe I could do it.
Can you reach it? Yes. You can do it.
There's a lot of crap in there though - see?
Yes. John, we're going to go to Close on this valve, just to lock it closed. Okay?
Roger. Let's see if that does any good.
I tried to clean all that crap out of there, but I wouldn't be a bit surprised. Let's see; we - we should be losing pressure, because we don't have an Auto Repress until we get down to about 4.4 or 4.6, and we're already at 4 - 4.95.
That thing is right now reading about 0.1.
That's 0.1 Delta-P?
Yes.
Maybe some of that Mylar lodged in the vent thing, whatever vents it. I bet you a hundred dollars that's what's happened. How much do you want to bet?
Hey, Tom.
Is it coming down at all, John?
No. Not coming down at all.
No. Not coming down at all.
Well, babe, I'm putting it on Vent.
Was our gauge - Is our pressure going down?
No. We're venting into it and...
Vent seal - I checked the seal.
Look at all this crap in here. I tried to clean out that thing yesterday.
Do you hear air flowing?
You can't hear through here, though.
I wonder if we'd overpressurize here a little bit if that would put us at Closed.
Let me try something. I'll try to build up a little bit.
John, we're going to try to overpressurize here - Just a little bit; not much.
Okay.
Hey, John, I've got an idea.
Yes?
It's kind of outsville.
Yes.
If you could dump your cabin pressure down, say to 4 or 5.
No, let me build ours up, Tom.
Alright, we're going to go build ours up and see if that will help us ... seal, here.
Tell him, don't do anything until we help - build ours up.
Alright, that's building up our - that's what I want to do.
You all be careful over there now.
Okay, that should have it. That's plenty. Okay, our cabin pressure's up to 5.4.
Okay.
Look at this stuff in here! That should be enough on Delta-P on that whole area to see if that's sealed. Now try to vent it.
Okay. I've got it in Vent.
It's not doing it man.
I put it in LM Press for a while. Maybe that will blow anything out of that hole if there's something in there.
Okay. We've pumped ours up to 5.3 - to 5.4 Delta-P.
We can probably continue. Tom.
Yes.
Let's go ahead.
Okay.
[Garble.] What time is it getting to be? Are we behind?
It's 96 hours.
Well, we're getting behind.
Yes. Except we have about a 20-minute pad on all the stuff.
Yes.
Okay, let's go on. Tom. Suit Gas Diverter Valve, Pull-Egress.
Okay. Go.
Cabin Gas Return, Egress.
Go.
Suit Circuit Relief, Closed.
Go.
Tom, I've got an idea.
Go ahead, John.
I'm going to maneuver over to the attitude in Press, then roll.
Okay.
Pressure Reg A. Closed.
I want to get this loose here a little bit. Press Reg A. Closed.
Okay. Closed.
Closed.
Okay. Pressure Reg B, build the suit pressure up to - Wait a minute - to 8.85, and then we'll monitor for a decay.
Okay, coming up.
Roll zero, pitch 270.
Starting up.
Oh, shit.
Yes. If that isn't brown, I don't know what is.
That is. Yes.
Hey, I'm sorry, you guys. I didn't have no control over that.
What's that?
Yes, I thought, we were really wheeling around there when I saw us move.
How we doing? We're 8.
Stand by.
Go. Close it.
You can close it.
Go.
Okay. Monitor it for 1 minute.
Okay.
Looks good.
I've got a minute going over here.
You closed Pressure Reg B, didn't you?
Yes.
What's your decay doing?
I'm down to 3.35...
Yes, I'm already decayed 0.15.
How much did you get on it ?
Okay, Tom, there was a decay of 0.2.
Yes, Okay.
Hey, leave it that way. Was CO2 Canister Select, Secondary?
Okay, ready?
Can you reach it?
Okay.
Secondary?
Yes.
Monitor cuff gauge...
Man! That son of a bitch went down.
Monitor cuff gauge for 1...
Okay. See, it had to fill up that volume back there.
Yes, okay. Monitor it for 1 minute here.
Okay.
Okay, that's good.
Okay.
CO2 Canister Select, Primary?
Okay. Got it.
Suit Circuit Relief Valve, Auto?
Okay.
Cabin Press Reg A and B, Cabin.
Okay. Cabin.
Cabin Gas Return, Auto.
Check.
Suit Gas Diverter Valve, Push-Cabin.
Oh. Whew!
You push it ?
Yes.
You got to blow your nose on that one.
Yes.
Okay, Cabin Fan Control, Closed.
You want to turn that son of a bitch on.
Make sure it's the control , Tom.
Okay. Okay. Check.
Okay, verify CSM tunnel hatch Pressure Equalization and the Tunnel Vent valves Closed, and the tunnel vented. I guess we got to wait on this one, huh?
Well, no, you don't . All this does is just check the cabin Depress - Oh, yes, we do, because pressure will flow back in through here. This is as far as we can go.
We don't have to if that's closed.
No, but, see - The way this son of a bitch is built, this thing will just leak out and let air leak past. It's a flimsy [garble]...
That's right.
Hello, John. How are you doing over there?
Roger; I'm coming around to attitude, but I still can't see any vent.
Okay. The only thing I can think of - We've built our pressure up here, but it still won't vent any. I guess we'll have to wait until MSFN contact. We've got a decision to make here. If it won't vent, either you I can do it by dumping your cabin all the way - and that decision's going to be up to you - or else we'll just call the rendezvous off. It doesn't matter one way or the other. The main thing is to play it safe. Over.
Well, I don't know that - tunnel venting or not venting is a call-off for the rendezvous. Will you -
I don't either, Tom.
John, if you release - if you release that tunnel pressurized, we're going off of here like a goddamn springboard, babe. We've got 5,000 pounds of force on that tunnel where we release that latch.
Well, you ain't going anywhere until you get to the end of the latch [garble]. Right?
By that time it will be vented.
Yes.
Let's see what we can do besides this. I'm going to turn the AGS on, Tom.
Go ahead. Keep going.
It's sort of like opening the hatch against psi [garble] way.
Yes.
Yes. I don't know if they want to do that to the probe or not, though.
That's what I was wondering. What's going to happen to the probe?
Stand by for a Master Alarm.
Okay.
I'll bet you anything what's happened is that Mylar's gotten up in the...
Another Master Alarm.
Okay.
I'll bet you anything what's happened is that Mylar's gotten up in the --
Yes, I'll bet the same thing. The Mylar's in that vent hole.
I'd wait on that one. That's so quick.
Yes.
Hey, man, even if I vent my cabin, that ain't going to depressurize your tunnel.
Yes, if - if you would open the Pressure Equalization Valve on your hatch and vent that, that would do it.
We could do it...
You'd probably never close it with all that Mylar in there.
We could do it, Tom - from this end.
How?
We could open...
We could depressurize from this end.
Say again?
We could depressurize from this end. We've got to do that, anyway, for the - for our - our regulator check.
John, we could depressurize from this end.
Not all the way.
That sounds like bullshit to me, Tom. Let's wait and see What the big boys say.
Okay.
Yes, we've got plenty of O2 in the rapid Repress capability. It would probably be better for us to depressurize from this end, John.
When do we acquire MSFN again?
96:27
Still reading zero, Tom.
Okay. In other words, you can't vent that thing at all.
As far as you're concerned, have we got a good platform now?
Yes. Beautiful.
Darn it.
I think it probably would be best for us to do it.
We could go down partway anyway, then build it up and then come down and.do our regulator check.
Yes.
We've got nothing to lose. If that thing gets clogged again - and doesn't hold pressure...
Looks like it's holding good now. And our Delta-P's above his.
Why don't you take some pictures while you're there?
Son of a bitch! This freaking purse keeps falling out. Didn't these people fit this stuff - they put it together. This is as useless as tits on a boar hog. Okay. What's our basic for color on the lunar surface? 5.6 at 250?
f:4 Tom.
That's black and white. That's black and white.
Oh, color? Okay, wait a minute. I'll get it to you. I have it right here.
What do you want, color?
Color, lunar surface.
f:8 at 250th.
Well isn't that nice. Each one of these magazines you got to crank like that. And how do you get it with your gloves on? Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.
I thought they were all supposed to be ready to go the minute you put them in there.
It doesn't work. Come on now. You son of a bitch!
Tom, I reseated my - I reseated mine.
Still no vent, huh?
Yes, you say your cabin's up at 5.4 [psia]?
Heck, yes. When we pumped it up, it stayed there.
We could even go a little higher.
It could be leaking from here, but I checked my - I checked my - vent valve. I closed it and looked to see if it was sealed or not. The oxygen [garble] is locked. [Garble] I don't know what the heck it is, you guys. We get AOS here in a couple of minutes and then we can find out, I guess.
Yes, we're sitting, crossing our fingers right now.
Well, this back doesn't work; that's nice.
At all?
No.
Sure?
Well, take it out now [garble]. The camera works. She just don't work. [Garble.]
I believe you could dump your [garble]; maybe if you could just dump it to like 2.5 or something like that, that would be good enough.
That's what we were thinking of. Let's wait now until we talk to MSFN, I guess.
Hey, it won't work with the backs, Gene - o. It works by itself, but it won't work with the backs.
John, what - what angle are you at, so I can try and acquire.
(Laughter) Won't work, Gene - o. Just beautiful.
Roger. I'm about 300 degrees right now.
Without the back, huh?
And both of them - I've turned them, and cranked them and cranked them and turned them.
Both - both magazines. You got to be kidding.
I'm not kidding.
There's one more magazine there. Something's got to be wrong.
You're right, babe. Something's got to be wrong. We're all squared away. It works fine without the back. I've turned it.
Let's see it once.
Have at it. It shows you the direction to rotate.
It just doesn't work. No, it was - the lenses were on good, but I checked - it works beautiful without the back. Beautiful without the back.
Give me the screen for it.
... shit!
I've done everything. You can tell when it works without it.
Did you try a different back.
That makes the second back.
Let me see. Try the third back.
[Garble] third back yet.
Oh. I guess it's in here.
Roll it.
[Garble] anything to it. What is that, black and white?
Yes. See.
It works good now. Now to get the color to work.
Hello, John, are you at any - What angles are you at? Are you...
I'm at 300 degrees.
Okay, you'll have better contact, because we'll be in Omni; so you go ahead and tell them, and tell them - maybe we could vent down here, and get that thing vented, and then build our pressure back up.
Roger. Roger. I can't - we can't get the tunnel to vent. Over. We've pinned down Charlie Brown. Over. I've checked the vent valve, and - Roger. I'll say it again. We cannot get the tunnel to vent. Over.
Hello, Charlie Brown. Houston. We're standing by. Over.
Houston, Charlie Brown. Over.
Roger, Charlie Brown. Read you...
I checked the vent valve and...
Roger. I say again, we cannot get the tunnel to vent. Over.
Roger. Understand. Tunnel will not vent.
That's correct. We've checked the inflow valve; I've checked the inflow valve; I've checked the vent valve. And Tom and Gene have checked their Auto valve and their hatch seal around the hatch, and they feel some pressure inside their vehicle. And it doesn't appear to be leading into the tunnel, so I don't know what their problem is. Possibly some of that insulation has gotten lodged in the vent line, maybe.
Roger. We copy. Stand by.
This is Charlie Brown. Do you read? Over?
Roger. We read you five-by - about three-by, Charlie Brown. We copied that the tunnel will not vent, so we're working the problem now. Stand by. Over.
We can barely read you now.
What's your problem there? [Garble.]
Houston, this is Snoopy. How do you read?
Snoopy, this is Houston. We read you about two-by.
Okay. John's already described the problem, and we recommend that from what we can see up here, we're sure that Mylar insulation has plugged up up his vent line to vent the tunnel. We can vent it through the LM and go hard suit through here and repressurize this spacecraft. And we would recommend that action, rather than having the CSM depressurize. Over.
Snoopy, Houston. You're unreadable. We copied a few words about the Mylar insulation and that the tunnel will not vent. Otherwise, that's all we can copy. Over.
Hey, Let me talk to him. [Garble.]
Sure.
Hello, Houston. How do you read Snoopy now?
You're about two-by, still, Gene.
Okay. If we have to, we would like to go ahead and try and vent the tunnel through the LM. We will depressurize the LM part way and try and vent the tunnel part way, and then build the LM back up. How does that sound?
Roger. Stand by.
[Garble] this to work. You have to keep turning and...
Yes, that's what I did. Just turn the mother.
Shit, now I can't...
Tom, we ought to try and get a - We're waiting for [garble] landmark tracking, so we can't get a state vector. I can't go ahead with any more AGS work.
Hello, Snoopy and Charlie Brown. We recommend you skip the landmark tracking and jump to a high gain antenna attitude. Over. We'll have you some angles momentarily.
Yes.
Hello, Charlie Brown. Houston. If you maneuver to a 000 roll, 014 pitch, and yaw 000, and get into high gain, your angles are good in the Flight Plan. Snoop, your angles are good as listed in the Flight Plan at 97 hours. Over.
[Garble] still can't lock S-band.
Snoopy. Roger. Understand.
What did they say Geno?
They said if you maneuver to those angles, your high-gain angles are good as in the Flight Plan, and ours our good at 97 hours.
Roger, Snoop. Your angles are 193 and yaw 64 degrees on the high gain antenna when Snoopy gets - correction, when Charlie Brown gets the attitude.
What angles? My Flight Plan says Omni Antenna C.
Houston, repeat up to me where you want Charlie Brown to maneuver to? He can't read you.
In the angles.
Roger, Snoop. We want Charlie Brown to maneuver to 000 roll, pitch 014, yaw 000. It's listed in the Flight Plan at 96 hours and 40 minutes. Over. Skip the landmark tracking.
Okay skip. Understand skip the landmark tracking. Roger.
Say, I asked you what angles. What do you want for Snoopy and Charlie?
Got them already, Tom.
Charlie Brown/Snoop, let us know when you get there.
Roger. We're, we're on our way.
Okey doke. This way we get high gain so we can get our state vector update and continue on. We can't do much without that state vector.
Roger, Snoop. We copied about - We see Charlie Brown maneuvering to high gain attitude. Stand by on the tunnel vent. Over. We're coming up with a procedure for you.
Okay. Great. Thank you.
Okay, Tom. LM time is going to be about 360, right? 606 36 360 and roughly 40 above 400. Right?
Yes. Hey, how come you're feeding on the VOX through feed loop? Are you VOX?
No. We got a hot S-band mike when we're in ICS PPT and Downvoice Backup.
Okay.
I just left it there right now.
Alright. So the ground is reading us full time, when we transfer.
Right in this mode, they are. Yes.
Okay.
Okay, Geno. We'll have to keep this up a little here. I'll pitch a little faster.
Okay, babe.
Okay, that's off, and we'll check it.
Okay, Geno. We got 25 degrees to go.
Snoopy, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Snoopy. Over.
Roger. Houston. You're coming about three-by now, Tom. When we get high gain lockup, we'd like voice with the ranging off. Over.
Down Voice Backup.
Say again there, Houston...
(in Snoopy): Down Voice Backup ranging off.
Houston, how are you reading Omni now?
Roger. And in Down Voice Backup master, if you turn the ranging Off, we'll probably improve the voice quality some. Over.
Okay, Charlie. I've got the ranging off.
Roger. You're a little bit better, Gene-o. Charlie Brown, I understand you're calling. Go ahead. Over.
Okay, Gene-o. We got 25 degrees to go.
Okay, John. Understand 25 degrees to go.
Houston, this is Snoopy. How soon on a solution on this tunnel? Over.
I don't think they're reading us, Tom.
Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy. How do you read? Over.
Go ahead, Snoop. Over.
I'll have my high gain in a minute.
Okay, ... that I could read ...
Looks like he's about there.
Hello, Houston, this is Snoopy. Do you read? Over.
Go ahead, Snoop.
Okay, Charlie. Look, as far as we can see, it still appears to us like all this Mylar floating around in the spacecraft has probably got into that vent line. The only solution we see about it is we vent the tunnel and take it out through the LM and take us down. With Charlie Brown good it will stuff that Mylar right back into his valve - tunnel valve, which is no good. We'll have a rough riding Command Module, but if we did do something, we could live with the LM for a while. But that's about all we can see. And as far as we understand about the probe, it's probably not a good idea to release that probe until we've depressurized. Over.
Roger, 10. Correction. Roger, Snoop. We're aware of that. We will probably come up with that solution. The only thing about releasing the probe without doing a hatch integrity check, we're a little concerned about that. If you'll stand by a couple of minutes, we'll come up with a procedure for you for venting the tunnel. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Charlie Brown on the high gain. How do you read?
Hey, you're coming about three-by, John.
Roger. I'm reading you loud and clear now.
Okay. You're coming about four-by. You're picking up all the time.
Houston, how is Snoopy on high gain?
Hey, Snoopy, you're five-by. Stand by.
How is Snoopy on high gain?
You're five-by, Snoop. Stand by.
Standing by, babe.
[Garble] You can have these feedback loops.
You can hear it coming down and going back up again.
[Garble] descent O2.
Okay, Snoopy. You want to do another LM drift check now?
Yes. Let's get ahead of them while they're still figuring what their recommendations are. John, on my mark, let's do a Verb 06, Noun 20. We'll try to keep ahead of it while we can.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. Counting down on Verb 06, Noun 20: 3. 2. 1.
Mark it.
Roger. Plus two balls 167, plus 01380, plus three balls 94.
Roger. 00167, 01380, 00094. Over.
Got them.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. My reading 0620 [Verb 06 Noun 20], plus 30186, plus 19360, plus 35913. Over.
Roger. We copy. Snoop, Cap - Snoop, Houston. We'd like to uplink a - got a load for you, if you'll give us P00 and Data. And we'll have some word on the tunnel procedure momentarily. Over.
[Garble] Tom.
Roger. We're in P00 and Data. You got it.
Roger.
Are we doing the drift check now?
Houston, this is Charlie Brown. I never did get that DAP load. You got one for me? Over.
Roger. We got it here for you, Charlie Brown, if you're ready to copy. CSM weight is 36688; gimbal trim: pitch minus 0.73, yaw plus 0.82; LM weight 31117. Over.
Roger. CSM weight 36688; minus 73, plus 82; LM weight 31117.
Roger.
How do you want DAP set up today to balance these quads?
Stand by. Use a BD roll, Charlie Brown.
Say again. Over.
Roger. Use BD roll.
Roger. Use BD.
Houston, Snoop. Are you done?
That's negative, Snoop.
Never mind, I can see you're not. Have you got our DAP load on page 45?
That's affirmative. Coming up to you now. CSM weight 36688; LM weight 31117. Over.
Roger. LM is 31117; CSM is 36688. And understand the 501 and the 547 are still good.
Affirmative. Stand by. We'll be right with you, Snoop, on the [garble].
Okay. As soon as we get our load - Okay. We're going to proceed as soon as we get the computer back to updating the AGS, and going through the gimbal check until we hear from you.
Roger. We concur.
Snoop, Houston. We got just one more load to go and then we'll have it for you. Over.
Okey doke.
Hello, Charlie Brown. Snoop.
Go ahead. Over.
On that VHF A, was your squelch all the way off?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
I had the squelch up and down when you guys were transmitting. I couldn't do any good either way.
Okay.
Geno, I'm...
Yes.
...I'm right over Diamond Back and Sidewinder.
Are you really?
Right over.
Hello, Snoop. Houston. We are through with the load. The computer is yours. Charlie Brown and Snoop, if you're ready to copy, we have a procedure for you for your tunnel vent. Over.
Roger. Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Roger, Snoop. On activation 38, we want you to do - to vent the tunnel using the normal - the regulator check with the following exceptions. Are you ready to copy? Over.
Go ahead. Are we still hot?
It's not hot, Tom.
Go ahead.
Okay. We assume you've gone through the regulator check, so we're going to shorten this procedure. In step 2 - step 2 on activation 38, line 2, verify overhead cabin dump valve.
Tell them we have it.
We want that Open. Cabin repress to Close. Activation, page 39, step 3; the forward Cabin Dump valve, Open, then Auto at 3.5 psi. Now, that will give us 1.5 Delta-P in the tunnel and at this time, CMP should be monitoring the LM/CM Delta-P. Now, all we're concerned about is the hatch integrity check for the command module using this procedure. We don't have to take the tunnel all the way down. Now we will have to eliminate the RCS hot fire, the yaw thruster firing, and we'll get that out of the way after undocking. Over.
Okay. I think we got it, Charlie. On page 38, step 2, verify overhead cabin dump valve to Open instead of Auto; cabin Repress to Close on step 3; opened at Auto at 3.5; and we'll restrict the yaw firing thruster as you're concerned about the Command Module hatch integrity check, and for us to assume that when he releases the probe, that the 3½ psi will not hurt the probe. Over.
That's affirmative. We've run that through the experts, Tom, and it will not hurt the probe or the drogue. In repressurizing, don't forget to put the overhead dump valve - overhead dump valve - back to Auto when you Repress. Over.
Oh, yes. We know all about that, Charlie.
Okay. You just pressurize the tunnel back up again...
Okay. We're ready to go through it - We're ready to go. Right. We're ready to go ahead through it right now, when John's ready.
Roger. Now, we'd like you to stay...
Okay. Let me get up here in the tunnel there, Tom.
We'd like you to stay - Okay, troops. Now we'd like you to stay at about three and a half for a couple of minutes so we can get a hatch integrity check in the Command Module. Over.
Let's start there, Gene-o.
Okay.
Roger.
Okay. Go ahead, Tom. What position you want me to be on tunnel? Do you want me on CM Delta-P?
That's affirmative.
I'm going [garble] to get [garble].
Okay. Go ahead, Tom.
On what page?
Right here. Read it off.
We didn't do that regulator check, though.
No. we haven't done it; we're only going down to 3.5. Okay.
Cabin Gas Return, Egress.
Are you all doing the checks, you guys?
Stand by. Keep in touch.
We're starting it off right now, John. I'll give you a hack when we're going down. Cabin Gas Return, Egress.
Thank you.
Snoop, Houston. You'd give us a warm feeling if you could talk us through this.
Cabin Gas Return, Egress.
Okay. Cabin Gas Return, Egress.
Okay, let me go back to - back to...
How do you read my VOX, Houston?
Reading you five-by, Snoop.
...Did your suit start to flutter? Okay, [garble] ready.
Check. Cabin - Cabin Gas Return - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Start here, babe, or back here?
No, we've already got - we've already got through all that.
Okay, Houston, starting at 96:05, step number 2. Is that correct?
That's affirmative. Before you get started, we want both Press Regs A and B to Egress. Over.
Both Press Regs A and B to Egress.
I've got them Egress. Let's go.
Roger. They're Egress. Cabin gas return, Egress.
Verify overhead cabin dump valve, Open.
Okay.
Stand by, Overhead Cabin Dump valve, Open.
Stand by.
Open?
Yes. That's affirmative.
Okay. Cabin Repress, Closed.
Go.
Okay.
Got it closed?
Okay.
Press Reg B, Egress. B Bravo. Okay?
Go.
Okay. Forward Cabin dump valve Open and in Auto at 3.5.
Okay, it's [garble]...
Why don't you get that, Tom, and I'll tell you when.
Okay, and I've got Press Reg A, Close; Egress, too. And this should be Pull to Egress, right?
That's right.
I don't know. What'd I tell you? Wait a minute.
You didn't have...
Okay. I'm reading a minus a half psi on my CM/LM pressure gauge right now.
Houston, where is the suit gas diverter valve on this? It's in Egress, that should be right.
Suit gas diverter valve should be in Egress.
That's what we figured.
Okay.
And just to verify, we got Press Reg A in Egress and Press Reg B in Egress. Is that correct?
Yes, that's right.
Affirmative.
Okay. We're going to start dumping the cabin down to 3.5.
Rog.
Do it slowly, babe.
Okay. There's 5.
Okay. I have a half a psi.
4.8, 4.5. 4.2.
Okay. I have 1 psi.
4.0. 3.8. [Garble.] Hold it. 3.5. Stop it, Tom. Okay. We're down to 3.5 and our suits are 4.2.
At 1.5 psi.
Roger. Snoop, we copy. 3½ psi. And we copy Charlie Brown, 1½ psi. Now hold - Let's hold for a couple of minutes to get a hatch integrity check. Charlie Brown, watch your cabin pressure. Over.
Yes, I'm watching her.
This is like spring in Chicago in here. There's snow all over the place.
Rog.
Hey, Tom. I'm going ahead with the AGS bit while I can.
Okay good.
Okay. What's you guys' pressure, there?
Snoopy, you holding your 3½?
[Garble.]
Okay. I think it's starting to build up which meant the tunnel pressure's built - yeah, it's started to go up to 4.
Okay. Mine's down to 1, now.
Houston, did you read Snoopy? Our pressure went from 3½ up to 4, and then Tom just closed the Overhead Dump valve.
Roger.
Okay. Mine's holding at 1 right now.
That's because they built theirs up, I guess.
Charlie Brown and Snoop, we are satisfied with the hatch integrity check and the CSM. Now, before - Snoop, before you repressurize, go to Cabin Gas Return to Cabin. Over.
Roger. Cabin Gas Return to Cabin.
Okay. You can start repressurizing now, and we'd like to get you a - When you get back in configuration, we'd like a hatch integrity check for you, too. Over.
Cabin Gas...
To Auto...
Okay.
Cabin Gas Return to Auto.
Cabin Gas Return to Auto, is what you want, isn't it?
That's affirmative.
Okay. And we are ready to Repress, I guess, at this point.
Roger. Go.
Okay, [garble] get this out of the way.
Okay.
We've got 5; that's good enough, we've got 5.
Okay, Houston. We are up to 5.
Roger.
Forward Cabin Dump valve, Open in Auto; it's Auto. Press Reg B, Close.
Data procedure [garble].
We had a procedure for it. Wait a minute.
Do you have a procedure for us on the integrity check?
Say again, Snoop?
Okay, you're going to pass us a procedure for a hatch integrity check?
Negative. Just get in configuration, and if you hold pressure, that's good enough for us.
That's alright.
Well, we're okay.
Okay. Fine. You can press on. Over.
Okay.
Tom, we ought to do that regulator check, huh?
[Garble.] The tunnel's just vented down there...
Screw the damn thing. Let's go on.
Yes, let's go on. Well, I think, we - what we - our functions - I'm going to put - Let's put this final configuration for undocking, okay?
Snoopy/Charlie Brown, only thing is reminder Press Regs A and B back to Cabin. Over.
Roger. We'll get them, Charlie.
Roger.
Okay. We're maneuvering back to the attitude this time, Tom. We're going to be a little more rigorous now.
[Garble] some flow in here; ready?
Okay. Press Reg A and B, Cabin.
Yes, they're Cabin; the Repress is Auto. All set.
[Garble] take my helmet and gloves off.
Yes.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Two things for you: we'd like another readout on the LM/CM Delta-P, and also disable all roll jets. Over. Until we can get undocked.
Roger. All roll jets coming Off and LM/CSM Delta-P is 0.9.
Roger.
Houston, this is Snoop. I gave the AGS an update and an alignment, and then when I checked Verb 83, my local vertical angle goes off by about 20 degrees, so I'm going through the procedure again.
Roger. And we have a K-factor update for you. Over.
Okay. Fire it.
Roger. 090 00 03 00.
090 00 03 00?
Affirmative.
Snoopy, Charlie, this is Houston. We'd like to - We got a little problem with your Gyro platform it appears, and X Gyro torquing angle is a little large. We'd like you to repeat the drift check. Over.
Okay. You want to repeat the drift check. Roger. Give us a second, here.
Roger. That's on page 43.
Tom, when I load in the K-factor, I just load it in verb - in 90, don't I. Huh?
Yes. Yes, [garble] hot voice.
I load it in 47. They want you to do the drift check again, Tom, after this starts flashing. Yes, No problem. We haven't been doing; it that way, but [garble], we've just been going and just making the AGS monitor with that, so - yes. Six of one and half a dozen of the other. It doesn't, matter.
Charlie Brown, Houston. We'd like one more read-out of the LM/CM Delta-P. Over.
Roger.
Okay, it's 0.8.
Roger.
They want you to do the drift check again, Tom, after this starts flashing.
Yes, yes.
Snoop, Houston. We copy you entered the K-factor wrong. We need 90 hours and 3 seconds, not 30 seconds. Over.
Okay. 90 hours and 3 seconds. My mistake.
Better let that run its course. Why don't you start on the - on the DPS - DAP throttle tests? You can do that...
Well, I've got to get this fine aligned; then I'll...
Okay, Okay.
Charlie Brown and Snoop, we have 30 minutes to LOS. If we don't get the RCS hot fire in, we're still Go for undocking. You can do that on the backside. Over.
Roger. What's the latest time for undocking now, Charlie?
Stand by.
Tom, you go ahead and get that drift.
[Garble] be flashing a [garble] and I'll need that to [garble]...
Snoop, Houston. Undocking time is 98 22. You got an hour and 4 minutes. Over.
Roger. 98 22 00.
This thing's operating so slow, I can't...
Yes, I know, it really is. Okay.
Charlie Brown, Snoop. We're ready to do another one of those drift checks. Let me know when you have Verb 06, Noun 20, and I'll give you a Mark when they Enter. Over.
Over.
Roger. 3, 2, 1.
Mark.
Verb 06, Noun 20.
Okay. Plus 00393, plus 01300, plus 0428.
Roger. Copy. That's 00393, 01300, and 0428. We need one more number.
00428.
Okay. Got it.
Which one?
Okay.
Snoop, Houston. Let me read you the angles that we got...
What say?
...and see if they confirm. You ready to copy?
Go.
Roger. For the CSM, it's plus 00393, plus 01300, plus 00428. For the LM, plus 29959, plus 19285, plus 35578. Over.
Houston, Snoopy. Those are correct. Over.
Snoop, Houston. Somebody cut in on us here on the loop. Did you copy those angles?
Roger. I copied them and they look correct. We're going to go ahead and go through the DAP throttle set here.
Rog.
Hey, Tom, circuit breaker Stab Control DECA Power closed? Mode Control, Auto.
Go.
Mode Control, Auto:
Okay, Houston. Charlie Brown here.

Proceed [garble].
Go to it. Over.
Roger. Sep. It's RCS/G&N and it's NA down to Noun 33, and we've got 098:47:16.00, NA down to the pitch angle, 014 degrees. Over.
Proceed.
Roger. 098:47:16.00. 14 degrees pitch.
What's our trim?
Good readback, Charlie Brown.
And we go Engine Arm. Descent, and we do not Proceed. Okay, we did Verb 34, Enter.
Okay. Houston, this is Snoopy. TTCA coming up to 40 percent.
Roger.
Now soft stop. Now Max throttle. Now Min...
Rog. We copy.
...and it looks good.
Roger. We copy.
And Charlie Brown, we noticed when you went through your DAP load, you did not update your gimbal trims, and they're quite a bit off. Over.
Okay. I'll fix them.
Houston, Snoopy. How's that for a K-factor time?
Stand by.
Okay. If it's a good K-factor time, it's going in.
Okay. The K-factor's good.

Oh, wowie! Okay. There's helium pressure kickdown slightly. Where did it go? Hey, we're Go on that pressurization.
Turn it Off, Master Arm, Off.
Okay. Recycle. Let me recycle these valves. See what happens, those damn things go when you do it.
Okay. It looks like we got all the Parker valves squared away.
Hey, Snoop. You know you're transmitting.
Yeah, I know it. Okay. Verify Master Alarm, Off.
Go.
And RCS Regs A and B warning lights are Off.
Go. Descent Reg.

Roger. Give me a second.
Okay. Min and hold. You got it.
Okay. We are going to start your RCS checks, and we'll give you a hack when we go hot fire.
Okay. Remember I don't have any roll jets.
Roger. And we will not yaw.
And, Charlie Brown, you can have your computer back. We're through with your load, and we're with you, Snoop, on the hot fire.
Okay. Charlie.
Okay. These are all cold fire. Cross stop, roll right.
God damn!
Let me recycle those.
Damn caution and warning system.
Okay. Try rolling right again.
There's another one. Freak.
That's no good. Roll left.
Houston, are you reading these numbers?
Roger. We're reading them.
Okay pitch up. Okay. Pitch down. Okay. Yaw right. This is cold fire.
Okay. Yaw left.
Okay. John you can go to wide deadband Attitude Hold. Houston, what do you make out of that?
I want to make - I want to - [garble].
Roger.
Stand by. I think we're okay. Stand by.
You want to put your helmet and gloves on for this?
Houston, we'll stand by for your Go until we proceed further.
Roger. Stand by. And, Charlie Brown, we show you in the DAP MIN deadband, over.
That's right.
Charlie Brown, you can go to wide deadband for us now, attitude hold.
[Garble] undocking [garble].
[Garble] We haven't begun the day yet.
Yes (laughter). You want to be on hot mike?
Make any difference?
Look at those.
They'll go out when you can push the valves, push the breakers in.
We can't wait around for them to...
Let's - let's continue.
Snoop, we're Go with those numbers in the cold fire. Go ahead with the Min (minimum) impulse, step 5.
Okay. Real good. We'll go ahead. That's the first time we've seen numbers that haven't gone to the full range. I just wanted to check with them, the whole analysis [garble] Okay. We'll go ahead.
Guidance Control, AGS. AGS, Attitude Hold.
Go.
Okay. Attitude Control, three, Mode Control. Okay. Your Commander is four jet, Enable. Now, when you hit hard over here, it's going to be a hot fire.
Yes.
Charlie Brown, Houston. We'd like you in wide deadband. Over.
Stand by.
Charlie Brown, let us know when you get in wide (deadband) because some of these are going to be hot fire.
Okay. We're in wide.
Okay.
Okay. We're going to proceed, and we'll let you know when we hot fire here.
Okay.
Okay, Tom we don't want any yaw. Is that right?
That's right.
Okay, roll right and, John, you'll get a pulse of hot fire. Let's go. Pulse it.
Good.

Okay, thrusters seemed nice and crisp. Seemed real good.
Okay. You want to yaw right and left without going to the hard stops?
Yes.
Let's go. Okay. Attitude Control, three, Pulse. Okay get your four GTA (should read TCA-Thrust Chamber Assembly) breakers in and I'll get mine in.
You want me to recycle the [garble] here?
All in?
Yes.
Okay. CWEA open and closed. Okay. All the lights are off. All the flags are off. This is the hot fire in the AGS. Commanders - TTCA; okay, ready to do it?
Yes.
Up, down, right, left, and then fore and aft. John, are you ready for a hot fire?
Go ahead.
Okay. Up, down, right, left.
Go.
Forward, aft. I guess they all fired, babe.
They all fired, Houston, but we couldn't get it on the DSKY, because I made a real short pulse.
You wouldn't get them anyway. This is AGS, babe. We weren't...
Yes. Right. Yes.
Roger, Snoop. We copy. Charlie Brown, we'd like to go BMAGs Att 1 Rate 2, so we can get some attitude hold. Over.
Okay.
Guidance Control, PGNS.
Yes.
Okay, now we'll see them on here. You better tell them we're going to hot fire again.
John, we're going to hot fire again. You ready?
Go ahead.
Okay. Go up.
It fired.
Down , You got to fire long, and I don't think we want to.
No.
Right.
Yes.
Left, forward, aft.
Did we get a - We got to hit it E, 6, Enter [garble].
Son of a bitch, yes, I do. We never got a - Hit a E 6 E. Enter 6. Okay, now try the right and let, fore and aft again. Okay, we got this and we got this, but you've got to hold them longer, and - we don't want to hold them longer.
Yes, I don't want to waste any...
Why don't you tell them that?
Okay, Houston. You probably read the DSKY didn't go, but I didn't - I made just short pulses. I didn't want to waste any fuel here and hold it that long with the condition we have in the tunnel. So, they fired and they fired real crisp, so I think we're in good shape. Okay.
X-Translation, 2 Jets.
Roger. We copy, Snoop. Stand by for our Go.
Want to go AGS?
Guidance Control, AGS.
Go.
Okay, We go right into rendezvous radar self-test.
Okay, Charlie Brown, Snoop. Verify that RCS thruster B3 Off, and your Radar Transponder Off.
Roger. The Radar Transponder; Heater and B3's Off.
Roger.
And, Snoop/Charlie Brown. You're Go for undocking. We had one indication that the - On your hot fire that jet B3 down, we had a TCP stuck on, but if you don't hear anything, we're Go.
Sounds good here.

Snoopy, Houston. Got some word for you on your torquing angles, your platform. Over. If you can listen.
Standby.
Go ahead. We're listening.
Roger, Gene-o. It looks like we got a constant bias in the, in yaw in your platform. On our two drift checks, we get a bias of - a torquing angle of minus 03.540, and it appears to be a constant bias because it's been the same between the two different drift cheeks. We're Go with that constant bias. We'd like Charlie Brown to look through the - his rendezvous window and see if we have a constant slippage, maybe, in the - in our docking attitude, and you can tell that by looking at the docking target. Over.
Roger. Charlie.
And, Charlie, give me a hack when we get close to LOS so that I can get off the high gain, will you?
Okay. We got 8 minutes.
Okay. I'll stay with you, if you pick me up at about 2 or 3 minutes. I'll go off.
Okay.
Okay. PGNS Rendezvous Radar circuit breaker, Closed.
You just yawed off. You yaw to my left about I'd say 2 degrees or so.
Okay. Go.
Okay. Fine. We get a 3-degree bias, so that's it. Be advised that you're drifting off in yaw, Charlie Brown. You might want to watch your attitude.
Roger.
Okay. Go.
Okay. Flight Displays: Range/Range Rate, Altitude/Altitude Rate. Closed.
Okay.
Range Rate...
I got it.
...and Altitude/Altitude Rate.
Okay. Should be coming out of mode 2.

Wait 10 seconds.
Snoopy, Charlie Brown.
Go ahead, John.
Roger. The EVA preparation is complete.
Okay. Good show.
Charlie Brown, Houston. We're concerned about this yaw bias in the LM and apparent slippage of the docking ring. We'd like you to disable and keep disabled all roll jets until after undocking. Over. And undocking attitude - We will not maneuver to the undocking attitude. Just hold what we've got. Over.
Roger. Okay. Fine.
And, Snoop, we got 3 minutes 50 seconds to LOS, Over.
Roger. 3:50 to LOS.
And we'll see both Snoop and Charlie Brown at 98 25.
Alrighty. Real fine, Charlie.
What's the tape meter say, Tom?
Tape meter says 195.5. And the range rate is reading 479.
Okay. Charlie Brown and Snoop, 3 minutes going over the hill. You're Go for undocking, and we'll see you around the other side.
Roger.
Roger.
Wow!
Okay, Geno.
Okay. You got all those?
Yes. Next thing is VERB 34, isn't it?

No Track light, On.
Yes.
Crosspointer, Center.
Right.
Snoop - correction - Charlie Brown, Houston. Try it on docking if it is apparent that the LM has - interface has slipped around to about 6 degrees; do not undock, and let's come around, again and look at it. Over.
Okay.
Roger.
Okay. There it went out. Next one, Verb 41, Noun 72.
Charlie, let them know it's 3½ (degrees of slippage) now.
Roger. Your yaw bias right not - The slippage is 3½ degrees right now, so about double what you've got, and if it does that far, do not undock. Over.
There.
Up rate?
No, no. You want to designate it Down, babe.
There you go. There you go. Plus - plus 283. There you - there - there it goes - right where it should be.
Okay, babe. There it is. Pull your...

Go.
Verb 44, Enter.
97:34.
Oh, my golly.
Go to the AGS CAL. Okay. What can I do for you?
John, are you going to be maneuvering or are you fixed now?
No, he's fixed.
Okay. I've stopped maneuvering.
Okay. I'll go into the AGS CAL, and I'll tell you when you have to disable thrusters. Okay?
Roger.
While Geno's going through this, according to what we had originally, John, I think you're fairly near the undocking attitude that we originally had, aren't you?
Yes.
It won't take much in stationkeeping to work it out. I hope those cats know what they're talking about - about putting that load on the probe when it extends - I think they probably are, because as soon as that starts to crack, that pressure should vent ..
Yes, I know. We're almost at the undocking attitude, except we should be rolled 180.
Okay. Okay. Now, are you going to roll over 180 after we undock, then?
No. When I get - The first thing I do when I undock is roll back right side up. So I'm okay.
We must be okay like we are, huh?
No, you'll have to figure out what the heck you're going to do. I'll be danged if I know.
Well, look, babe, I'm just going to stay right in front of you .
Okay.
And if I'm right side up, the heck with it. I'll just go around like that. Don't worry about us. We don't want to waste any fuel. And if you just hold your attitude, when you release us, all I'm going to do is yaw right, and pitch - I'll yaw right and then pitch up. We should be face to face, then.
Okay. We've got a small right roll going. Now I don't know where we'll be when we get there.
Okay.
Okay, John. I'm at the - I'm at the point where I got to - my AGS calibration to do so - you've got to maneuver - you know, to that place where you're less than 0.1 degree per second - and we got those...
He can't.
You can't do it, huh?
No.
No, they told me not to do it.
No. Our tunnel ring is slipping right. now, so we can't do it, so we'll just have to skip.
Find out where we are now. Tom, and that thing anyway - I'll just do it anyway. Going out to 1620.
See, he's drifting.
We can't do on AGS CAL test, huh?
That's right. That little old Mylar just might screw up a few things around here.
Okay. The only thing I've got left on my side is DPS pressurization and checkout.
Well, shoot, if I can't do this, there ain' t much sense in worrying about it.
No.
Okay, let's pressurize the damn DPS.
Okay, John, we're going; to Go pressurize the descent stage, here. Okay.
Let me check these. Press - temperature is Go.
Oxidizer is barely Go, but that's alright.
No. it isn't, it has plenty. Go

You want to deploy our landing gear?
Alright...
Do it.
Let's do it.
John, we're ready to deploy our landing gear.
Roger, [garble].
Okay, Tom, circuit breaker (11) , ED Landing Gear Flag, Closed, and your Logic Power, Open.
Okay.
Master Arm, On. I can't catch it, it's dark anyway, so...
It's - to heck with it. Let's keep on.
Go ahead.
Okay, ready.
Wait a minute. Landing Gear Deploy, Fire.
Okay, your B is Closed, A is Open, right?
Yes. Stand by.
The gear is coming down, John.
Looks like we've got four in the green, babe.
I don't know how we know it, but...
Logic Power, Closed?
Yes. Fire the gear again.
Landing Gear Deploy, Fire, again.
Yes.
Did you do it?
Yes. Master Arm, Off.
Master Arm, Off. Landing Gear Flag, Open?
Yes.
Can't get an AGS gyro drift check, I guess. Not when we're moving like that.
No. I'm going to go ahead - we undock at 98:22, right?
98:22, Yes.
Is there anything else we need in this activation?
How about setting up my orb rate here in a minute.
Yes.
Wait until this update gets in.
Oh, shoot!
Hey, listen, you guys. I think this thing is off about 3 degrees. Maybe it must be steerable. I can't really - it looks Okay.
I think we are in good shape holding here, John. How's the tunnel pressure?
I still have 810.
Okay, it looks like it's holding, It looks like those things should lock in pretty good again. Right? When we - the solar...
Yes.
[Garble] solar corona.
What did that do to our alignment?
Have to pick it up again. Look at the solar corona there, Geno. It's a whitish yellow.
Yes.
John, I got the solar corona out here and the sun is going to be coming up shortly.
Roger.
Where you looking? Let's see.
Right through there. Can you look out my window?
Yes.
Just at the rims, with some of the mountain peaks are starting to get lighted. Beautiful view.
Watch it when it pops. It'll really hit you. Boy, that is beautiful, isn't it?
Here come da Sun.
Some of those peaks are lighted.
Yes.
Here it comes. Watch out. Boom.
Wow. Man, I tell you. When it comes, it comes.
Why don't I go ahead and put mine back here, Geno?
You got the final there. Let's verify these circuit breakers.
Okay.
We got about 31 minutes to undocking, John. We'll undock early so we can get squared away.
How about setting up my 8-ball, Tom, as soon as I verify it here.
Yes.
Set it to what, Geno?
Sorry. John. I didn't hear you. What did you say?
[Garble] where you want me to set up?
Where you want him set up? I don't know. Tom asked you something. I'm not sure what it was.
Tell him to stand by.
Stand by a minute.
Gene, I'm set up and ready for the undocking, babe.
I'm going to put this back in the data file.
Got your Balance Load and Cross Ties both closed, huh? Your Bus Tie, rather.
Yes.
Your Bus Tie isn't Closed, is it?
Yes.
Okay.
No. My Bus Tie isn't. I'm sorry.
Leave those - leave those closed.
I've got to have water. I'm thirsty as hell.
I didn't get a very good agreement on this at all. Look at that. I never have.
I never did get agreement.
Hey, can you guys fix that yaw thing?
How are we going to fix it?
John, no problem. See, we'll just keep what we've got, and then as soon as we go into nighttime and align we'll be in good shape. Okay?
Okay. Boy I'm sure sorry. I don't know what the heck did that.
Probably what got to us is this doggone insulation.
That AGS is bad, babe. I don't like that. That's - that's - That's 40 degrees. How about setting up my Orb-rate ball, babe?
Okay.
How is it?
That's the best we got, right there.
Hey, I don't like it...
Shit. We're drifting like mad.
Shoot, yes.
I guess we'll just have to wait and see on that one, babe. I don't know. We'll try it again. Let's go through our normal procedures, and if we get lost, we'll go back to VHF Simplex.
Okay.
José.
I don't know. Wait a minute.
What - How far are you going to have to maneuver. If I - Once we get squared away, all you have to do is maneuver in roll. It doesn't hurt us a bit. Are you going to have to maneuver much in pitch and yaw?
About 10 degrees.
Ah, hell. That won't hurt us a bit. You want to undock 10 minutes early? And get squared away? Or 5 minutes - 5 minutes should do it.
I think we should.
It's up to you. I'm sorry. I inadvertently hit the stick.
You have Verb 76 in now?
Oh, you put it in.
Huh?
You put it in, huh?
I sure don't like that angle.
