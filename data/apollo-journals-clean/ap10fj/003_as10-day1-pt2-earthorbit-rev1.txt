[Garble] at 56.
Roger. Stand by, 10.
Okay, Houston. We show a 102.6 by 101.1 [nautical miles].
Roger. We copy that.
And our VI was 25,565 [fps], minus one-tenth H dot, and 102.6 [nautical miles].
Roger. We copy.
[Garble].
And, Charlie, have them take a look at our evaporator. We're reading a high outlet temperature and Off-Scale Low on the steam pressure right now.
Roger. We agree. Stand by.
Okay...
10, Houston. Your S-IVB is safe. We'd like you - On the evaporator, we'd like for you to close the Primary Back Pressure valve, and activate the Secondary Loop.
Roger. Understand. Close the primary back pressure valve and activate the secondary loop.
Roger. Just for a little while. We'll give you the number. And we'll have Vanguard LOS at 15:32, and a minute gap. And, we'll see you over the Canaries at 16:29.
Roger. And, we have closed the isolation valve on CM RCS ring 1 [panel 2], 2 is still Open.
Roger.
10, Houston. The Saturn is in great shape; you're configured for orbit; we're all Go.
Roger. Just looks beautiful.
And 10, Houston. We confirm your orbit. The IU vector has you in a 103 by 100 [nautical miles].
Roger.
10, Houston. We want you to keep the Primary Back Pressure [Panel 382] valve closed for about 15 minutes, and then we'll deacti - Stand by.
Roger.
10, Houston. At GET of 30 we'd like you to put the Primary Back Pressure [Panel 382] valve back in Auto and deactivate the Secondary Loop [Panel 382].
Roger. Understand. You want - at 30 - You want to deactivate the Secondary Loop and go back to Auto on the primary boiler.
Affirm, Gene
Apollo 10, Houston. Standing by through the Canaries.
Roger. 10 reading you loud and clear. We've just completed that insertion checklist.
Roger. Copy. And, 10, Houston, would you like for me to review this ring 2 heater check?
Why don't you do that ...
Okay, Tom. We'd like for you to - We got a 7-step procedure here, and I'll read it up to you. On panel 8, CB CM heaters, 2, Main B, closed, CM RCS Logic, On [panel 1], CM RCS heaters, On [panel 101]. We want you to heat ring 2 for 15 minutes, and you can select position C5 on the systems test [also panel 101] and monitor the Ox line temp.
[Garble].
Correct - 10, your first step would be to close the RCS Propellant Isolation valve on ring 2 [panel 2
We'll go ahead and do that right now, Charlie.
Okay. Then you can - then we'd like for you to - If you are going to close the Prop valve right now, we'd like for you to turn the heaters on, too.
Okay. Turn the heaters on right now.
Affirm. And then after...
10, Houston.
Okay, Charlie. We're going through the procedure; the heater is On.
Roger.
Okay. And we'll turn them off after 15 minutes. And you say we can monitor what on C5?
You can monitor the oxidizer line temp on C5 - it'll probably be Off-Scale High, but if you see any change, we'd appreciate you - we'd appreciate you telling us.
Roger.
Okay. We got that, Charlie.
10, after 15 minutes, we'll - We'd like for you to turn the heater off, RCS Logic, Off [Panel 1], and open both heater circuit breakers.
Roger. Will do, Houston.
Charlie, it's just fantastic to be back up here again! Fantastic, really.
Man, you guy's - [laughter]. You guys really sound great up there.
Yes, Charlie, after 3 years, it seems a long time, but here comes the Coast of Africa again and it looks beautiful.
Yes, I'll bet. Wish we were there with you.
They make you feel - we all feel great.
Roger. Next time we are going to put a cot on board and one of us is going along.
Roger.
Apollo 10, Houston. The P52 is your option. It really looked great during the launch phase; we have an azimuth correction of minus 0.11.
Roger. Minus 0.11. Thank you.
10, Houston. If you've taken your helmets off, we'd remind you to open the Suit Circuit Return valve.
Roger. We're gonna do that now.
Okay.
Apollo 10, Houston; you've got about 1 minute to Canaries LOS; Tananarive at 3; - correction - 37.
Roger. Tananarive at 37, thank you.
Apollo 10, this is Houston through Tananarive. How do you read? Over.
Apollo 10, this is Houston through Tananarive. How do you read? Over.
Tananarive, Houston Comm Tech Net 1.
Houston Comm Tech, Tananarive.
Roger. Can you confirm that CapCom is uplinking through your site?
That's affirm. You are uplinking.
Have you heard any downlink from the spacecraft?
Negative. No downlink.
Roger.
Apollo 10, this is Houston transmitting in the blind. Confirm Simplex Alpha [Panel 3]. Over.
Apollo 10, Apollo 10, this is Houston through Tananarive. Over.
Houston, Apollo 10. Transferring to broad. We're reading you loud and clear.
Roger, 10. And now we're reading you loud and clear. Up.
Okay. We've been reading you all the time down there, Houston. John and Gene have completed the P52 [IMU align], and the torquing on the IMU realign is minus 0.12, plus 0.34, and minus 0.76. Looks like the platform is real good.
Roger, 10. We copy. Understand platform is good.
And we will turn the Command Module RCS B heater off at 43. That will give us 15 minutes on it.
Roger. We confirm - We confirm that. And - Your Prop Isol valves, Off? RCS Propellant valves, Off?
That's affirmative, Charlie.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 10. The [garble] on the heater is Off-Scale High, which we expected for the heaters, and we're going to turn the heaters off at 43.
Say again, 10. You're fading in and out.
Roger. Command Module RCS heaters, Off at 43.
Roger. We copy. Off at 43.
10, Houston. We expected that on the heaters. We'll have LOS here at Tananarive in 30 seconds; we'll see you over Carnarvon at 52.
Roger. Understand 52. Our radiators appear to be working all right. Our Glycol Evap Outlet temperature is down around 58. The steam pressure is Off-Scale Low, Off-Scale Low?
Roger. Steam pressure Off-Scale Low?
That's affirm. And the evaporator outlet temperature is 58 degrees with - with the radiators apparently working.
Roger. We copy, Gene.
And, Apollo 10, Houston. If you read, we'd like you to close the Primary Back Pressure [Panel 382] valve again. Over.
Could have been - hell, it was close to the launch; it could've been air pressure from the ground in there.
Okay, you can close it.
Closed. Okay, 21.5. Should be like zero.
Okay, now what do you want to look at?
[Garble].
Why don't you take these and [garble]? Okay?
Yes; just a second.
COAS looks [garble].
Okay, everything - looks alright. Okay, I've got Mars in there now, son of a gun [garble].
What's our chances on [garble] into the water?
Gene, how's this?
How - how come these bastards gave us this star chart with no [laughter] Velcro?
[Garble].
You want this whole package, John?
Yes.
Here are these breakers, these light things - [garble].
John, can you read your [garble]?
Maybe I can.
John, do you want this back?
Yes - no, I don't want that. No, I don't want any of that shit (laughter). God - we had to take it. I don't want it, give it to - give it to [garble].
[Garble] keep that light on.
You don't want that on.
You don't want the Moishe Dayan patch?
No, I don't [garble] [laughter] [garble] the walls.
I'm going to set that other one up in orb-rate and align that GDC [Gyro Display Coupler] to the IMU and get all that good stuff done.
You want me to [garble] all those closed for you?
Do you need the star chart, John? You don't need that there, do you?
No. Got to take the launch guards off the end.
You want to stick them in this - in here, or where you want to put them?
No, I'll put them down here in A-5. There's a whole separate spot down there to stow all that crap.
Okay. Here's this one.
Okay. Have you got your cards out for TLI?
They're already up, babe.
Okay. And that Flight Plan is out to everybody's satisfaction?
Well, gee, I don't...
Everybody have all the pages they need?
Where's the Flight Plan? I don't have the Flight Plan.
Flight Plan we need. It's in R-12 [storage container].
Yes. It better be, or it's all [laughter].
Oh, shit!
The MAL procedures are in there, and [garble].
[Laughter] I swear to God, that burn effect - You know what caused that? The damn hose.
Things ought to be cooling down in here a little bit.
It doesn't happen; then you've got stuff down in the box that just sits there.
Now, you want to get into panel 382 back in there?
Let's see. I need the ORDEAL ...
Well, I - I [garble] - I get it [garble] no sweat.
[Garble] piece of cake. Well, I don't know if I can get that [garble] give it a go.
Let me stick this underneath you, Gene-o.
Ha! Yes, guess I can get it.
Okay.
No sweat. That ain't it.
It's down below, there. [Garble] you want that camera bracket out [garble]?
Yes.
[Garble].
Here you go.
[Garble] it, John. There's a camera bracket right up in the ...
The next one?
Yes, [garble].
I've got it.
You've got it?
Okay, [garble] I can't [garble].
[Garble].
[Garble].
[Garble] all this freaking [garble].
You got the [garble] flow valve open?
Yes.
We had enough water boiling on launch, John.
We didn't have no water boiling?
[Garble] should be operating right now.
I thought it was the water boiler that [garble].
It is the water boiler. [Garble].
[Garble].
Okay.
Got that.
[Garble] 183.
[Garble] torquing angle [garble] realign [garble] realign the PTC [garble] attitude reference check?
Yes.
You done all them other things? Gene-o?
[Garble].
[Garble].
Gene-o? [Garble].
[Garble] (laughter) [garble].
Shit! [garble] temperature [garble].
[Garble].
Did you get this GDC Align, Tom? Got any drift to record?
No.
BMAG, Rate 2 [Panel 1]?
BMAG, Rate 2.
COAS is Go?
Completely done.
COAS Tunnel Lighting, Main B, Closed? Circuit breaker panel 226, John? COAS Tunnel Lighting, Main B?
Got to get a flashlight [garble] Main B, COAS Tunnel Lighting circuit breaker. Main B, coming Closed.
No, it's Open, John.
It's Closed now.
Okay, where's the sequence camera? [Garble] Tom.
[Garble].
Do you want the sequence camera?
No.
How about the sequence camera? [Garble].
Okay, mount ORDEAL, all ECS redundant component checks less main regulator check ... just went through all these things.
[Garble].
Okay, Secondary Coolant Loop? Open coolant panel, coolant panel required, Evaporator Water Control, Secondary valve, Auto?
How about our [garble]?
You want the sequence camera?
Yes, we got some [garble] we need to get.
Okay, how about going down [garble]?
Oh, I guess [garble].
Hello, Apollo 10, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
Roger, Houston. This is Apollo 10. We're going through our ECS checklist and everything looks good.
Roger, Tom. Comm is real great.
Roger. We got the - we could read you all the way through Tananarive, but evidently you couldn't read us - COMM back here until the last. We got the heater off at exactly 15 minutes, the propellant valve was shut, the logic was off and the breaker open.
Roger. We got the - We could read you all the way through Tananarive, Houston, but evidently you couldn't read us - Comm back here until the last. We got the heater Off exactly at 15 minutes, the Propellant valve was shut, the Logic was Off and the breakers Open.
Roger. We copy, Tom.
Okay...
You want the Coolant Control Panel, Open; huh?
Yes. That's what it says - it's required. Evaporator Water Control, Secondary valve, Auto.
Wait a second, wait a second. I think we launched with the goddam thing.
Probably did.
[Garble] I'll tell you what I'm going to do with this [garble].
Hey, wait...
I'm just going to close one valve - one [garble].
Hey, we know that secondary loop works, babe. We're not going to worry about that. I [garble].
[Garble]. How do you know the water control valve came on?
Okay, let's go - Well, we don't, but it...
It had to be. Okay, the secondary mode control - Secondary Evaporator [garble] valves in Auto. [Garble]. Primary [garble] bypass on the Secondary [garble].
I just got to make sure [garble].
Okay, you are - you are...
We've already accumulated some [garble] stuff, and I got [garble].
[Garble].
Well, [garble] spacecraft they flew [garble].
[Garble] voice check. We're over Carnarvon. [Garble].
[Garble] goes back up here?
[Garble].
Houston, Apollo 10. Did you get our torquing angles on the IMU realign?
Roger, Tom. You were pretty weak. What I copied was minus 0.12, plus 0.34, and minus 0.76.
Roger. And everything looks real good.
Roger. Can you give us the time that you torqued those?
Yes, I got it right here.
Stand by.
It was 41 minutes even, Charlie. That's what I paid special attention to that.
Roger. Thank you very much, John. 41 minutes; special attention.
Okay, the next thing is that [garble] camera. Where's the...
I don't really think that it's going to be too hard to get up in that tunnel. I think it's got to be a piece of cake. Look at this. I [garble].
Hello, Houston; this is 10.
Go ahead.
Okay. Guess you got my word on the Off-Scale Low on the steam pressure on the Primary Loop.
Roger. We've been discussing that, Gene, and stand by. We'll have some words on it for you.
I just rechecked the Secondary Loop and it all looks good on it. Going through all our monitor checks and redundant component checks. Looks like we've got a good Charlie Brown, here.
Roger. Good.
Apollo 10, Houston, with some words on the - the primary evap.
Go ahead, Charlie.
Roger. We'd like you to put the Back Pressure valve back to Auto - correction, Manual. And we wondered if you went to Auto on the H2O valve during launch?
That's affirm; I sure did. I went to Auto on the steam pressure valve and the water valve.
Okay. We want the steam pressure back to Manual, and we're going to think about it a little bit more, and we might reservice later on.
Okay, fine. Looks like our radiators are beginning to carry the load. I'm looking at about 51 degrees on the Evap Outlet Temp.
Roger.
Apollo 10, Houston. Gene, everybody thinks I might have given you the wrong word. What - Now to clarify it, we want the Back Pressure valve Closed. Over.
Okay. In other words, you want Steam Pressure Auto switched to Manual, and you want me to go to Increase, is that correct?
Affirmative.
Okay. Well, I'm in Manual now. I'll go to Increase.
Houston, this is 10. Do you want me to leave the Water Flow in Auto during - after I do this?
Stand by
10, Houston. You can leave the water valve in Auto.
Roger. Understand.
Hello, Apollo 10. Houston on the S-band through Honeysuckle. How do you read? Over.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 10. Reading you loud and clear.
Roger, Tom. Same. The S-band is really great today.
Roger. I've never seen the comm better. It's great, Charlie.
Roger.
Apollo 10, Houston. We'll have LOS at Honeysuckle at 1 plus 06. We'll see you over Guaymas at 1 plus 28.
Apollo 10, Roger.
Yes, I think so. [Garble] lost control of the checklist and cards. I lost [garble] card. I don't know where it is.
[Garble].
[Garble]. We'll find it. [Garble] I know where it is.
Okay, [garble].
Okay.
[Garble].
Hey, I know what I can do. [Garble] garbage bag. Get the garbage bag.
Yes.
[Garble]. Yes, it's got to be in there.
[Garble].
Yes, but get the garbage bag. Okay. [Garble] leave them [garble]. There it is. Oh, shit!
Just having trouble controlling things that's all.
How does it feel moving around down there?
It's great!
[Garble]. Trouble is, I can't tell [garble]. Which one is that? [Garble] back here [garble].
Want all three of them?
That has to be it.
[Garble].
[Garble].
Look at those [garble]. Yes, [garble].
[Garble].
[Garble] little warm in here.
[Garble].
[Garble] backup [garble].
[Garble]. [Laughter] [Garble].
[Garble] cotton-picking display or [garble]. Look, are you [garble] do it with one hand?
[Garble].
How far down [garble] anyhow?
About...
[Garble] do that [garble]!
[Garble]. I can't get [garble].
[Garble].
I hate to tell you this, but my cord ain't long enough.
Is that right?
Yes, Now it is.
[Garble].
Where is - where is [garble] right here.
It's a lot easier in zero g [garble].
Okay, you want to do it?
Yes.
[Garble].
EC 1 Main A [garble].
What do you [garble]?
[Laughter.] [Garble] equal to opposite Reacq. How about that? ...
[Garble].
[Garble] zero g [garble].
[Garble] 5000 [garble].
[Garble]. Hey, where did we say we were going to - Oh, that was after [garble].
That was that thing there. I don't know how to work it. [Garble] how to work [garble].
Oh, I don't know [garble] that stuff around [garble] outfit.
Yes, we got - you got...
[Garble].
[Garble].
[Garble]. we could turn it on right there [garble].
No [garble] TLI...
Oh. [Garble].
[Garble].
[Garble].
Yes. [Garble].
Yes, this thing feels like a [garble] truck [garble]...
God damn!
...[garble] big battleship going across [garble].
[Garble] man [garble].
[Garble] so hard to get out. I just [garble].
[Garble] I better leave it on [garble] leave it on there on account of [garble]. And the monitor's in [garble].
[Garble].
[Garble].
Want the monitor?
No.
You want the cable? That goes from the monitor to the thing?
I'll close the hatch [garble].
[Garble].
[Laughter.]
This time is so good, I can't believe it.
[Garble] zero g's what I can't believe.
Oh, man!
Want to hold it, Gene-o?
[Garble].
Okay, this comes [garble]...
[Garble] hatch [garble] You don't believe what about the [garble]?
Oh, I come from Alabama...
[Garble].
I know you can't miss it [garble].
Okay, [garble] on this [garble].
Anybody care for a [garble]?
Isn't that something? Isn't that something?
Oh, yes.
[Garble] try the other, babe. I [garble] over here [garble].
[Garble].
[Garble] BMAG's [garble] How'd it get -
[Garble].
Yes, I [garble].
Oh! [Garble].
God, this thing's really got [garble].
[Garble].
You could tell lift-off, babe. I knew when we left the ground.
[Garble] clock.
[Garble].
[Garble]?
[Garble].
[Garble] track of these things.
[Garble] nothing to hang on to [garble].
[Garble] you don't want [garble].
[Garble].
[Garble].
[Garble]. my foot's over here and [garble] up here [garble].
[Garble].
[Garble]?
Yes.
[Garble].
[Garble].
This is the hardest job we've had.
[Garble].
[Garble].
No, you could take...
I can [garble].
[Garble].
We're practically in [garble].
[Garble].
Question is, do I have [garble]?
Want me to get over there and help you?
No. I think I've got it [garble] on that [garble]. Here it is [garble].
[Garble] get your [garble]. Hey, anyone found an isolation valve open today?
[Garble] isolation valve [garble] today.
[Garble] isolation [garble].
[Garble] valves open, nobody knows [garble].
[Garble].
Okay. They okay?
Yes, I think [garble].
They all good, John.
[Garble]. What's the cabin pressure?
Cabin pressure is 5.6.
[Garble].
[Garble] I'll get back [garble].
Okay, I [garble].
Hold it.
[Garble] the other [garble] at TLI?
No. [Garble].
[Garble].
John.
I tell you, I think this thing looks like it's nose down, Oh, God, [garble] look ahead.
[Garble].
Look ahead.
[Garble].
Absolutely incredible.
There's the Moon, too, old buddy. [Garble].
I don't believe it. [Garble].
John.
Okay. Hold it, Okay.
I would describe [garble].
[Garble].
You got to aim for the [garble].
Looks like the [garble].
Okay.
How about the [garble].
Yes, they're - they're...
[Garble].
[Garble] are you looking [garble].
I'm - I'm [garble].
[Garble].
[Garble]. in there?
Yes, we [garble], babe, [garble].
Gene-o? [Garble]. Could you get it the other way? Could you swing that bottom part down [garble]?
That's about the right place, Tom, because [garble] how far it was up above this here [garble].
Yes, [garble] but the TV can't - the picture's going to be backwards, you know?
Oh.
[Garble]. There you go.
Oh.
[Garble] but you ain't going to be pointed out the window.
Okay, can you turn it around where that [garble]?
There ain't no way.
[Garble] extra, bracket, here.
[Garble].
There's just no way.
[Garble].
[Garble] doesn't make a hill of beans, Gene-o.
Why don't you go pick up that cable [garble]?
I already opened it up. What do you need [garble] cable here?
Yes. [Garble].
[Garble].
[Garble] bracket [garble].
Yes. [Garble]. There's only one other place it can go - and that'd be pointing the other way and that won't work, Now the [garble] bracket goes - If it were this one...
Well, what you need is to have one turned like that. Is there a bracket on this thing?
Yes, [garble].
Well, see, we'll [garble] on this bracket...
Will it fit? Where?
Right here.
Yes, but I want you to look out the damn window.
Well, I'll move it over then. I'll move [garble].
[Garble].
Its looking out the window, too [garble].
Yes. There just ain't no way to get it - What you're going to end up doing is - with that wide-angle thing looking at - If you don't have it right in the middle of the window, you're going to be looking at some of the window glass.
Can I hold it? [Garble] sideways. [Garble] it's either
Well, it won't go straight down, then.
[Garble].
[Garble].
If you can't hold it up, [garble] other way.
Let's give up, Tom...
[Garble]. Here's the X-axis here. [Garble] you can point it 30 degrees above the X-axis here.
Only trouble is the X-axis has got to be down that-a-way.
This [garble] ought to be pointing up the tunnel [garble]. Well, let me see.
No, he's - he's pointed up the tunnel. Put it back in there, Gene-o.
Well, this is the X-axis bracket [garble] right here. Now can you keep [garble].
Yes! There, it's parallel to them lines.
That's parallel.
[Garble] on it. This here - this here - this here - this here hatch - it ain't - The panel goes back that-a-way.
Okay, [garble].
Okay, I got the TLI [garble].
[Garble].
We have Guaymas at 01:30. About 18 minutes.
Okay, hold it.
[Garble].
[Laughter.]
[Garble]?
Yes, [garble].
Okay.
[Garble] I don t know what the hell [garble] take a few g's in that Saturn [garble] - [garble] take a few g's with that Saturn. How many g's do you get out of that?
About 1¾.
What's that [garble] on your window, Gene-o?
I don't know what the hell that is.
[Garble] it's all over, really. It isn't cut in there, is it?
I don't know.
Where? On Gene-o's window? Which one? That one there?
[Garble].
Oh, that one there; yes.
That's not a pressure window, but...
[Garble] on the back of it.
Yes.
It may not fit. Looks like it's going to be tight. You're going to have to bend the end of it.
That son of a bitch is tricky.
Yes.
Let's see, you've got your [garble].
Yes.
We're going to be picking up the west coast of Mexico...
I don't know where in the hell I'm going to be [garble].
Yes. We got plenty of time left. We've got 15 minutes. Do you want to test it and see if the monitor works? We're going to be getting an update [garble].
Well, I ain't got [garble].
This is the TLI plus 10-minute abort PAD, isn't it? I'll give it to you [garble].
Oh, [garble] look there. The [garble].
Put your hand down there.
[Garble].
You got some in your pockets?
Did you bring some extra Velcro with you, babe? [Garble].
I've got it all set up.
Do you guys want the spotmeter [garble]?
No.
Have you got a place to put it?
I don't want it. You want it, Tom?
[Garble].
[Laughter.] [Garble] willing to get it.
That should hold it.
[Garble]. We've got to have two docking [garble]. [Garble] Baja California.
[Garble] Baja California.
[Garble] lock on.
