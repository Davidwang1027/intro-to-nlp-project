John, we're looking at 130 - almost (1)35 miles (250 km) and 305 feet per second (93 m/s). Look at that.
Look at that fuel go.
I copy 1339 0276.
Oh, man, you're right on the nugget.
We got - we got one horrendous update about the first mark, and then that's it, and everything is like tenth of a foot per second (0.03 m/s).
That's beautiful.
That Z-axis tracking puts you right on the old money. Have you got your flashing light on?
Yes,.
I don't think he can see us.
I don't think we can see that far - There's a little reflected light, but I don't - I don't think we can see it. Let me see that God-dang Hasselblad, I'm so fed up with the God-dang...
You can't do a thing, babe, it's burned out. Absolutely, the batteries went dead. I took the batt...
Doesn't even work with the backup.
No, shit, it went dead, and I switched the batteries around...
You switched batteries?
You bet your life. I'm not going to hear you and the ground go u-n-n-h then u-n-n-gh.
Hey, John, would you believe that Tom's Hasselblad went completely out after all the Mickey Mouse of trying to get backs to work, and then my sequence camera has two packs that you have to jam in, twist, and turn before they'll work, and when you're trying to do it in a hurry, there ain't anyway.
Look, sunshine.
We're in darkness yet, sort of. Hey, yes, we're in darkness yet, John. We're coming up on sunrise.
Tom, let's take what pictures we can with this sequence camera.
Yep.
You got it open wide?
Yes, part way. Let me open it some more.
It's awful dark down there.
I felt like we could have got out and walked, you know it?
Yeah.
Gee, I'm sure glad we had every bit of - of simulator time we've had.
You bet. OK. How does that look? 102:55. OK, that's good.
Oh, there's that central peak, babe...
What one?
I'm trying to figure out where we're coming in.
How about minus 01832. That look good?
Yes. It's retrograde and up.
OK. How's that look? OK?
Yeah. Leave about a 9 by 43 on the board.
220.9 should be the total.
How come we're tracking him upside down?
That's why we ended up started. Proceed.
That's good. I don't have much film, babe. I want to take some of it coming back down.
Yes.
Oh, that's great, babe.
One more big burn, and then it's like Gemini.
Yes. Like in the old days, Gene-o.
You guys did good, man. You're just great!
What did he say?
John, just wait there for us.
That machine of yours is working pretty good too, ain't it?
Yes.
Sure is.
Hey, do you still - 46.2 by 103 (85.6 by 191 km). That's good.
Say again. Over.
OK. How did your VHF ranging work, John?
I have 130.52 (miles) (241.72 km) by 3, by 2, by...
My God, look at that! That's great!
Beautiful. Beautiful.
That's incredible.
Yep.
John, you can't believe these thrusters in here. It sounds like somebody pounding on the side of a garbage can. The whole thing creaks and moans.
It what?
It's not a dull thud, like it is in the Command Module. It's like a big garbage can you're standing in the middle of and someone's banging on the lid.
Oh, boy, that sounds real bad.
Thank you, sir. I appreciate that.
Here, we got to get some food, because it's going to get busy again.
That's what it sounded like to me Man, this lunar surface is bunch of craters.
Yes.
I feel like I was there with you.
Yeah.
I was getting a vicarious thrill by watching you guys disappear amongst them. That's beautiful.
Yes. We were right down there among them. Hey...
I could see that.
Hey, that new white crater - you know Censorinus A, that Jack's interested in?
Yes.
That thing has big white and black boulders, both on the inside and outside, and I mean they are huge. I'd estimate it'd be 80 to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) in diameter, those boulders.
Did you give me insertion Delta-V's and times?
No but I will. You want them?
Yes.
102:55:01.40.
Go ahead.
Ah, Delta-V, Noun 81, is minus 0183.2.
OK.
Plus all balls and minus 0123.5.
Roger. Mine is 183, plus 0.2, plus all balls, and minus 0122.5.
Right. Minus 123.5.
And 102:55:01.40.
That's it, John. Do you have the CSI time that they gave us originally?
Negative. Over. I need the CSI and CDH time; CSI and TPI time.
OK. The original one was - CSI is 103:45:34.
OK.
TPI is 105:21:01.
OK.
Alright?
Got them.
How is our home up there?
Oh, it's too roomy for me.
Hey, Tom. we're - we're in fatsville on fuel so far. That's good.
Well, you have to go... that's OK.
What are you using for a garbage can? This thing right here?
That's a good place.
Top - top row would be a good garbage can.
Yes.
(Coughing)
I told Jack that we were going to get a 70-millimeter filmstrip of this back here but, babe, there's no way. We don't - The whole damn 70-millimeter camera quit, and two 16-millimeter film packs may or may not work. One happens to be the interior film.
Listen, babe. I tell you. I've been so busy I wouldn't know if there's any Moon down there or not. I might as well be back in the simulator.
It's about the same here.
I think you're with us.
That damn star - star is right smack in the center of that mother, babe. Right smack in the center. And your COAS came out good, huh?
Yes. A third of a degree down.
Boy. I tell you I was worried, when we didn't have radar to start this whole thing.
Yes. Me, too. Boy, I... really sound good.... right in the..., I'm sure.
Probably is, John. We're reading 100 and oh - I guess...
158 miles (292 km).
How are our ascent batteries? We got plenty - Are they off the line? We've got plenty of them?
They're back off. We've got 35 volts in them. 34 in one and 35 in the other,
Got one big thing to go - two big things - staging and insertion.
I'll tell you one thing, John. I feel more at home standing up in here than I do laying down in there. I never did understand that.
Roger, Gene.
I believe you could really go down and land with this bear.
I'm sure...
I think Tom and I were surprised. Weren't you, Tom? It is - it looks a lot smoother down there than I first thought.
Yes.
That pisses me off so much that that camera failed, Tom.
Yes.
You changed the batteries and everything in that. God! We ought to have someone's ass. And I know these film packs are not tried individually on the camera.
I guess we is going to go nice and high. Hey, we just pegged our range-rate meter.
Yes.
That's where to stop, by the way.
for you auxiliaries. Beautiful. OK.
I'm taking marks at 178 miles (330 km), that ain't bad.
OK. What do you want to do now?
Rendezvous Radar breaker, Open?
OK.
Yes, go to Auto. Rendezvous Radar breaker, Open?
Yep.
AC Bus breaker Open?
Yep.
Now minus 40 minutes. I can't see that. I'll start - I'll connect the ascent batteries; start working on that.
Sure be nice to know where the hell we are.
Want us to turn over?
Can you read that clock up there, Tom? Insertion minus what?
51 (minutes).
Huh?
51.
50.
Boy, if this thing isn't working like a charm! It's beautiful.
I'm glad to hear that.
I have you guys, right in the middle of the optics, and I...You look like a bright star.
Where - where are we?
We're up above him. Until we roll.
Oh, we're up above you, that's right.
Yes.
We're up...
You're up above at 201 miles (372 km). Man, this is good visibility. I mean to tell you.
You want some grape juice? You want some...
I know where we are. No, I don't want anymore, Tom.
I bet we could see him if - if - if we were looking a little while ago. No, I guess not.
No.
I know where we are, though, babe.
OK.
Right here.
Let me get this food squared away.
We're right here. I got these all picked out. This one, this one, this one; we're right here. And John, we're about going over the top of 297; that's at 150 East.
Roger. Gene-o, these things - these things don't operate like - out in frigging space like the simulator does.
Where are we at?
Where's that monocular, Tom?
Shoot.
God. I wish we had a camera.
Well, I don't know.
Is it in your purse?
We went into the heat of battle trying to get that camera. Here.
Thank you, sir.
I'm tracking you guys with 20 degrees of trunnion angle, now. This is just a beautiful thing.
Well, we were saying -
Here's exactly where we are. Right here. Over on your side, you ought to have 14, Tom. Big, big, big crater.
Got it.
You got it?
Yes.
Yep, there it is, I see it from here.
Hey, why don't we pitch around for it? OK.
And we don't have a God-danged 70-millimeter to shoot this with. That -
Let's see, we want to be tracking him later on, don't we?
Yes, at minus 36 minutes, we track him again, so we might just as well pitch down a little bit.
Yes, we'll pitch down and -
Roll over?
Yes.
(Coughing) Yes, that'd be better. Watch that roll on the 8-ball, though.
Yes, yes.
You want a brownie?
God, you're just all full of good food today. Thank you.
We've been busy, Gene-o. In darkness, time goes fast (laughter).
I'm not sure whether water's better in here or not. Did you see this? I'm going to take that back and give it to Jack.
Yes.
What did you guys do - pick up a rock?
No, this is Jack Lousma. I've got a United States Marine Corps big gold and blue and red emblem on my armrest.
We're coming straight down. There Jack's crater again. (Laughter)
OK. You want to track José...
Won't take so long to bring it up, when we do it next time.
There's that one crater I shot so many times, that's got boulders on it? You see it? It's the little volcanic one, right there. See that rascal?
Yep. Now why don't you pitch up a skosh. Here, let me see if the - Oh, I was going to see the AGS to find out where you are, but -
Yes, go ahead.
I will. Wait a minute until I finish this.
I'm in mode - I'm in Pulse. Go ahead.
OK.
AGS. Computer.
Yes, there you go. There's this big one right down here. XV.
You know, if your eyes were a photograph, it'd be great.
I'm going to lock on. There's our landing radar.
There's...
She's 50 degrees.
You really have to be careful with this film, when you don't have any left. There's the one Jack marked that he wants. I'll get it for him.
Hey, when do we fire the helium tanks?.
Not yet, babe.
You want some more brownies?
No.
go hungry.
That music even sounds outer-spacey, doesn't it? You hear that? That whistling sound?
Yes.
Whooooooooooo.
Did you hear that whistling sound, too?
Yeah. Sounds like - you know, outer-space-type music.
I wonder what it is.
Hey, Tom. Is your - is your insulation all burned off here, on the front side of your window over here? Right...
Yeah.
Mine's all burned off. isn't that weird - eerie, John?
Yes, I got it, too. I was going to see who was outside.
You mark that set of features, Gene-o. I'm going to fix us some grape juice. OK?
OK man. I've got you 269 miles (498 km) over the Man, that's that's just fabulous.
You'll want the LGC.
Roger. I'm.
There's the one Jack wants a picture of, over there. I'll get that one for him with this camera, Yes, these pictures that Orbiter took are fantastic.
Bet I'm locked on a side lobe.
Yes, we sure is getting high.
Yes. 286 miles. Oh, this radar is great.
Yes. I got it.
It's going to go right out to 310 miles. Just like we said.
Is it really?
Yes. I'll tell you when you get to 327. You don't - you don't know when AOS is... do you?
Yes, I've got it written down. AOS for us is 102:25.
It's 102:21 for me.
OK. 40 minutes, babe. I got to connect the ascent batteries.
OK.
OK. Stand by BATs 1 and 3, High Voltage, Off/Reset. Bat's 1...
OK.
Boy, that sure is weird music.
We're going to have to find out about that. Nobody will believe us.
No. It's a whistling, you know, like an outer space-type thing.
Probably due to the VHF ranging, I'd guess.
Yes. I wouldn't believe there's anyone out there. OK, Tom, I'm going to call up P20.
We want to pressurize our APS here. You get your Rendezvous Radar breakers all In?
Oh, yes. I'm locked on to him.
OK.
It may be a side lobe.
It's weird, isn't it?
Isn't that weird?
I think that's a side lobe.
Is it? Huh?
Yep.
See.
See what happens now.
It ain't doing, babe. Why don't you go ahead and lock on by yourself again.
Shit, why don't you find them? Well, let me - let me do it this way, see whether it will find them. We got to get going here, we got to pressurize and everything.
Yeah, I know it.
P20 doesn't work worth a darn.
Tom, why don't you get them manually.
OK. OK, let's go up to P00, huh?
Pick them up manually.
AGS.
Call P20.
That's where the AGS says he is, right?
That's where the AGS says he is.
You're Deadband, Min?
Yeah. The AGS is pretty good. Its state vector's updated.
Boy, this is - this is lots more sissy than the simulator. Deadband, Min? OK.
Hello, Charlie Brown. Houston. Over.
Roger. I'm looking at 316.45 miles on the - on the radar right now.
Roger. We copy. We'd like you to go to P00 and Accept. We have a state...
This thing is working?
Roger. We'd like you to go to P00 and Accept. We have a state vector for you and a change on your backup, insertion PAD, if you're ready to copy. Over.
Look at that! John, are you still in track attitude, babe?
Go ahead. Over.
OK. Delta-VX and Noun 81...
Go ahead over.
Roger. Delta-VX and Noun 81 changes to plus 01720. Over.
I'll bet we don't even...
Hello, Charlie Brown; this is Snoopy. Do you read?
Roger. Delta-VX, plus 01270.
Hello, Charlie Brown; Snoopy. Do you read?
Roger. That's negative.
Yes. I just barely read you there, Snoop.
No track.
Charlie Brown, that was a bad readback on the Delta-V...
Say again. Over.
That's why this thing wouldn't track. OK, let's pressurize, babe.
OK, do you want to put your helmets and gloves on?
Monitor your ascent helium pressure, propellant temperature.
Say it again there, Charlie.
Roger, John. It's plus 01720. Over.
OK.
OK, Ascent Helium, Reg 1 and 2, Open; talkbacks' gray.
Go.
Roger. 01720.
Ascent Helium Selects, Both.
Both.
That's affirmative.
Master Arm, On.
Master Arm, On.
Helium Pressure, Fire.
Charlie Brown, Houston. I cut you out at the beginning of the pass. Say again, what were you going to say? Over.
Nothing important. I'm about to lose - I just lost range and went to 320.50 miles (593.6 km), and I'm no longer in voice contact with Snoopy. I think we're just flat out of range.
OK, Master Arm coming Off.
I bet you still - Why isn't that pressure going down? And that one coming up.
Roger. We copy.
I can hear him very faintly in the background.
Hello, Charlie Brown; Snoopy.
Roger. Charlie Brown, Houston. It's your computer. We're through with the load. Over.
We've got pressures. Don't we?
Roger. Thank you.
Yes, but I want to watch it go up; I guess it's going awful slow.
Oh, look out there. Oh, if I only had a camera! Get it. Camera.
Oh, shoot.
f:11; f:11. You got f:4 of those - those - Yes, now you've got f:11, yes. Beautiful.
Hello, Charlie Brown; Snoopy.
I'm just about to lose you, there.
Son of a bitch, where is he?
Hello, John, do you read us?
Just barely, you guys. Did you stage?
Hello. Houston, this is...
Go ahead. Go ahead there, babe.
I can't get radar lock. Hello...
We ought to be able to call them now.
Hello, Hello, Charlie Brown. Snoopy. Do you read?
Roger. Read you loud and clear now. Weak but clear.
Turning the Master Arm, Off.
I read you guys.
Hello, Houston. How do you read Snoopy?
Roger, Snoopy. Reading you five-by. Over.
Roger. Would you ask Charlie Brown if he's still in track attitude. I can't get any lock on at this distance out here. Over.
Roger, He had you - He broke lock at 320 miles (592 km) on the VHF. Stand by. We'll ask him on his attitude.
Roger.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Are you still in tracking attitude?
Roger.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Are you still in tracking attitude.
I'm in attitude 180 which is where I'm...
Roger.
supposed to be right now.
Roger, Charlie Brown. We copy. Snoop, Houston. He's in attitude as called for out in the Flight Plan. 180 pitch. We got your ascent looks good, the ascent battery looks good. Over.
Roger. We've just pressurized the ascent tanks, and they look good.
Tom, did - did we really - I'm not - I guess...
Roger. If you'll give us your computer, we need P00 and Data. We have a state vector for you.
OK. Zero, zero.
You've got it.
That's it.
We really hit ascent. God damn, that thing just didn't seem to - maybe it was so high to start with that it didn't...
Copy, Snoop. Out.
I'd guess we couldn't get any lock on at all out here. We had him, and he just slowly faded out.
Hello, Charlie Brown. This is Houston.
This is some attitude?
Charlie Brown, this is Houston. We show you loaded TIG incorrectly. In P30. TIG is 102:55:01.40. Over.
Look at that, Tom.
Correction, correction...
It may be 102...
Charlie Brown, that was my fault. TIG time is 102:58:01.00. Over.
They changed? Oh, that's his TIG time.
Roger. 0100.
Affirmative. Out.
OK, we got - 15 minutes from staging.
Yep.
OK, I've got to - I got to knock off the rendezvous radar and go to - to staging attitude. OK?
OK.
OK. How does that look to you?
Looks real fine, Charlie Brown.
Snoop, Houston. We got the load in. The computer's yours. Over.
Roger, Houston. Thank you very much.
Goddam this whole thing.
And, Houston, this is Snoopy. We've got about 14 minutes to staging. I'm going to go ahead and maneuver to staging attitude.
Roger, Snoop. We copy. Could you comment on your cameras? We might be able to help you out those. Over.
Roger. On the Hasselblad it looks like both batteries have gone dead. Over.
Copy. Both batteries dead on the Hasselblad. How about the sequence?
I'll tell him in a minute. I'll tell in a...
OK. OK, yep - We're on the ascent. I want to get over there, Gene-o.
OK. On the sequence, I've got two film packs that you have to practically jam, wire, and... step on to get them to make electrical contact so the camera will run. I've got one of them to run, and I'll try to get the other one to run.
OK.
We copy. Thanks a bunch. We'll work on it for you. Over.
It's just hard to do that when you're coming across a landing site and you expect it to work.
OK, let's recheck 30 again.
Roger, Gene. We copy.
Okay, go ahead.
And Snoopy's going to be maneuvering at this time.
Roger.
Open your Rendezvous Radar breaker, Tom. PGNS and AC Bus.
Yes, I've already got it open. Tried to get that Max distance there locked on, but it just wouldn't - Oh, this time has gone fast, Gene-o.
Yes, it has. OK, let me - we're right on. Let's get our helmets and gloves on, and then we'll go - we'll do - go through the cabin.
I'll get that out of your way.
Give me a hand there. Push on that. That's got it.
It's right here to receive it.
Yep. Keep getting it -
OK, Tom. Let me - let me call these out.
Yes.
Help you with - OK, I've got all the ascent batteries...
Hey, you guys must be about 250 miles out, would you?
on the line, and all the descents Off.
OK, T. P., I'm reading you. OK, you ready?
OK.
Charlie Brown to Snoopy. Over.
Suit Gas Diverter valve, Pull/Egress.
Go.
Cabin Repress valve, Closed.
OK, stand by for another bang. Ready?
OK, I'm ready. Gollee! OK, Descent O2, Closed.
Descent O2 is coming Closed.
OK, Ascent O2 number 1, Open.
Open.
OK, Regs A and B to Egress.
Reg A to Egress. B to Egress.
OK, Water Tank Select to Ascent.
Oops! I need to - what the hell's wrong here?
OK, I'll check the Ascent Batteries. Oh I'm in a Deadface, Tom.
OK.
We are Deadfaced. OK, on your side AC Bus A DECA Gimbal, Open.
OK.

PGNS Landing Radar, Open.
Go.
OK, let's take another look at those APS temperatures and pressures. They look all right to me.
OK.
Try those. OK.
Snoop, Houston. The APS looks good to us. Over.
Roger.
OK. Roger, Houston. We're about 4 minutes and 23 seconds from staging. OK, Tom, and flip it out of here. The clock's set, and we'll go in the...
Snoop, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We copy. 8 minutes to staging. Over.
Roger. It's 8 minutes.
Mark.
Now, 7:59, 58.
That's affirmative. We're with you. That was my mistake. It's, it's 4 minutes to our 14-minute check. We're 8 minutes to staging, 07:50.
Copy. Out.
Just like to think ahead.
OK, Tom. Staging attitude should be - you should be looking at 295 upside down...
This is Charlie Brown. you'll have to keep me posted on what Snoopy's doing. I can't read them anymore.
and I should be looking at about 270 upside down.
Roger, Charlie Brown. Snoop's going through his staging checklist. He's got 7 minutes to go before staging.
And I'm going to call up Verb...
Houston, I can't read you either.
Gene-o, I'll tell you, when the ascent engine fires, we'd better be strapped down.
That mother may give us a kick.
I think it will give you a kick.
OK, Tom. If you get a chance reset my Orb Rate ball, will you, coming down. AGS agrees with the PGNS on that one.
OK. What's...
39. I'm way off now.
OK.
I'm about 290....
240.
OK, there's 270 coming up on 240, a little more. That's good. Right there. Stop it. OK.
OK, 15:34, Tom. At 14 minutes you get the Master Arm, On, and we'll leave it On, remember, right on through the insertion burn.
Yes.
And I'll set the DAP.
OK.
Matter of fact, if you stay in AGS, I'll go ahead and set it now.
OK.
OK, I'll go...
OK. We're in AGS. I'll set the DAP.
OK.
Snoop, Houston. We have you Go for staging. Over.
Roger.
Roger. Do you have an update on, the LM weight?
Roger, Snoop. Your LM weight is 8,290. Over.
Roger. Got 8,290. Thank you.
Hey, Tom, that's good enough for CSM weight, so, that's it babe.
4 minutes.
OK.
You going to have the sequence camera mounted?
Yes.
Charlie Brown, Houston:, We got it shown to high gain now, Snoop's 3 minutes from staging. Over.
OK, let's go through our checklist.
Roger.
OK, babe. We've gone through it right up to staging. We've gone through - you want to double check these?
Yes.
Cabin Gas Diverter valve, Pull/Egress.
Go.
Cabin Repress, Closed.
Go.
Descent O2, Closed.
Go.
Ascent number 1 O2, Open.
Go.
Pressure Regs, both Egress.
Yep.
Water Tank, Ascent.
Go.
Ascent Water, Open. I opened that.
Yes.
And Descent Water's Closed. I closed that. I checked the voltages, we're dead faced. We're on ascent batteries and the voltage looks good here.
OK.
You got your breakers pulled on that side?
Yeah.
OK, at 14 minutes, put your Master Arm, On.
OK, Master Arm coming On.
Att/Translation 2 jets.
Att/Translation 2 Jets.
Guidance Control, AGS.
OK, we're in AGS. We'll go to Attitude Hold.
And you're in Attitude Hold; Deadband, Min; so for staging - actually be up there, if you want.
Yes, I think that would be better for stage.
I think that would be better for stage; otherwise, you're going to banging those thrusters all over the place. Now, I should be looking at 270 upside down and you looking at 295 upside down. That's coming right in.
We're a little bit out of plane, which won't hurt us for any separation.
OK. And that - the DAP is set - I'll call up P47 at 11 minutes.
OK.
Let me take another look at the DAP, Tom.
OK.
12002. That's go. OK. Call up 47 in 1 minute. OK, Tom. I'll thrust aft 2 feet per second (0.61 m/s). I'll stop. I'll start thrusting forward and you stage-fire.
Yep.
Got your Master Arm On?
It's On.
OK. Then you got to go up to...
OK.
My attitude looks good. I'm coming up on 270 upside down.
OK.
And yours is, looking good. OK. I'm calling up Noun 47.
OK, go.
OK, There it is.
OK, your TTCA in.
OK, that's that way and then that way. Right?
Yes. I'll just take a little bit that way.
Yes, because we're going to be awful light.
Yes. We're going to - AGS is going to Mode Control.
OK. Stay out of there, babe. OK, stay at that last attitude.
Something's wrong here. Hold it, Gene-o.
OK.
Going to try Deadband, Min here.
AGS ready. AGS any time you want to go.
Something's wrong with the yaw rate gyro. Let's go in PGNS and Attitude Hold. OK..
By the way, the DAP is set for a light vehicle. OK, we'll do it...
OK. OK.
this way. OK, you ready?
OK, hold it. We're in - OK, go.
Ready?
Thrust aft. Hold it. Thrust aft. OK, ready?
OK.
Stage. Gimbal lock.
Son of a bitch.
Let's go to PGNS. God damn.
OK, let's - let's make this burn on the AGS babe.
We're in trouble.
Make this - make this burn on the AGS.
Got a good staging. Let's make it on the AGS.
How are the AGS? Are we OK? I think we're OK, Gene-o. Proceed..
Did you get into gimbal lock?
Yes, but we got out of it.
She didn't - she didn't go, huh?
No. No, let's go.
Got stage.
OK, what's our -? Did you call P00?
Yes P00's up babe.
OK, what's our attitude for staging? What's our angles?
OK. Our angles? You didn't lock, huh?
No.
Something is wrong with that gyro. OK, roll is 180, pitch is 233.
Roll is 180 and pitch is what?
233. You better put my ball on Inertial just to check them out and verify them, too.
Yep.
I can't reach it. So if you could put mine, you can verify it on the AGS.
Snoop, Houston. We show you close to gimbal lock.
Yeah, OK. Something went wild during that staging, but we're all set, we didn't lock it. We are going ahead to the Auto maneuver.
Roger.
What the hell happened?
Babe, I don't know. Let's put my AGS in Inertial - in Inertial, though to verify that we're at the right attitude, babe.
They look the same.
Huh?
They look the same.
Put it - OK. Just so it's in Inertial.
OK.
OK. Because in case we have to go to it, that's what we want.
OK, let's go again.
Let's get that AGS.
Ready?
Wait a minute.
We got to hurry.
Try to get this damn thing - Sure the PGNS...
Charlie, how is the staging?
is good, huh? Wait until that thing blanks. OK, babe.
Charlie Brown. Houston. They - staging - they had a wild gyration though, but they got it under control. Over.
Roger.
I'm in AGS Inertial, Tom?
Yep.
OK, that's good.
Roger.
We've got a lot of time; 7 minutes. I don't know what the hell that was, babe.
Did you push it?
Yes, it's all set.
OK, it'll be going here in...
Snoop, Houston. You're looking OK for the insertion burn.
a second, I just got...
Yes. Roger, Charlie. That, was something we've never seen before. It was real good. We went to AGS and...
The computer is yours, Tom.
You want to go through P30 again?
No. I went through P30. Go into P40.
Go to. Oh, 232 Beautiful, beautiful.
And, let me tell you what happened there real quick as we come around to this insertion burn. I went to attitude deadband, started thrusting aft, and the thing just took off on us.
Roger. We copy.
So I could see we're coming up - and we come up to insertion, so I flipped - I got a hold of it and tried to avoid gimbal lock, and guess I did. Looks like we got a good insertion out of it anyway, and - I mean, a good staging out of it and we are all set to go for insertion here.
OK, Tom. Call 06 86.
OK. The computer's yours.
Are we going forwards or backwards? Oh, we're going...
We're going backwards.
Yes.
That's the way we want to go.
Yes, right, right, right. There's the Orb Rate ball; we're in good shape.
I'll tell you, there was a moment there, Tom...
(Laughter)
but let's worry about it after we make this burn. I want to make sure the AGS is up for it.
OK, we're going to Auto, and I'm going to P00 - Let me call - let me call the DAP again.
OK.
Going 120.
We never did go into PGNS, so the DAP didn't do it to us.
No.
Snoop, Houston. Stand by for a Mark; 5 minutes to the burn.
Mark.
Five minutes to the burn. Over.
OK, Charlie. We're with you. I think we have got all our marbles.
OK, ready?
We is sure coming down to that ground, I'll tell you.
I wonder where that stage went?
I don't know, but I hope we never find it again,
Yes.
Man, I'll tell you, that was wild, babe, and it wasn't the DAP, because you were in AGS. That was AGS.
I was in AGS - I was in AGS; Mode Control, Attitude Hold. Right?
Yes, wide deadband.
Wide deadband.
That's where we're going to stage. OK, babe. I've got good AGS, and everything is looking good. I've got the attitude set so if we have to switch, we'll be alright. OK. 04:07. I'll monitor it until the burn. We're 4 minutes. OK. Four minutes. Boy, that is hard to do with helmet and gloves on. Helium Monitor to Ascent Pressure 1 and 2. Let's take...
OK.
take another look at it. That's looking good. Engine Stop, push buttons, all Reset, and Abort/Abort Stage, Reset. OK.
Yes.
Push buttons reset?
Go.
AGS Translation.
Yep.
I mean ATT/Translation, 4 jets.
Yep.
OK, Tom, That's...
Houston, I'm not reading them, so if they don't make it, you've got to tell me. OK?
if 170 (52 m/s) is greater than our...
Roger. They are counting down. Looking good, Charlie Brown.
Delta-V to go. OK, Tom, If - if we've got less than 170 feet - if we've got more than 170 feet per second (52 m/s) to go, we're RCS, and we'll RCS maximum, of 55 seconds, but we will RCS.
be advised...
If Delta-V is greater than 170 (52 m/s), we're RC - RCS back, to our PAD Delta-V.
OK.
OK? Which is going to be right in P40 there.
OK. Your AGS looking good?
AGS is looking good.
OK.
OK. And our PAD Delta-V is 220.9. So if we burn less than 170 feet per second - If we don't get up to 170 feet per second to go, we'll want to burn it back to about-about 220. OK?
Yes.
But let's get over 170 (52 m/s) - let's get into that 170 feet per second (52 m/s) region.
OK.
OK. Push your Inverter number 1, Closed, circuit breaker.
Go.
And at 1 minute, your Stab/Control, AELD, Closed.
OK.
Boy, I'll tell you, we is down among them again going backwards, you know that?
Yes, I'm still trying -
Look at that rille. That's got to be - that's got to be probably Diamondback right there.
Yes.
It's awful close to see that.
Yes, let's keep watching this; we're at 2 minutes, babe.
OK, babe. Coming up about 2 minutes.
Got AELD coming Closed. Have you got yours Closed?
Coming Closed.
OK. Two minutes, babe. Give it a final trim.
OK. OK, ready?...
OK. There it is. OK. My AELD is coming Closed, Tom.
OK, mine's coming Closed.
OK. And verify your Inverter number 1 breakers, Closed.
Yes.
OK. At 35 seconds, we want the Engine Arm to Arm.
Yeah.
We're in PGNS; we're in Auto.
4 Jet, Balance Couple is On. And stand by to...
Coming right into the attitude, babe.
OK.
Got Engine Arm yet to go. Coming up on 01:12.
OK.
I'll hit 99, and I'll count you down.
OK.
Burn time is 15 seconds, so it's going to go in a hurry.
It's 220 total. Right?
220 feet per second (67 m/s) - 220.9 (67.3 m/s).
OK.
50 seconds, 48. Baby, let's make this one.
OK, Ascent Engine Arm, On.
OK, 35 seconds.
Ascent, Master Arm is On.
Master Arm is On, Engine Arm, Ascent; AGS Control in Auto, Deadband, Min; and we're set for this attitude on the burn and counting down 500.
OK.
OK, baby.
OK. OK, 12, 10.
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 99, 3, 2, 1...
Burn.
OK. OK, it's burning down.
Burning? OK. 160 (49 m/s) to go.
Roger, Snoop. You are burning.
134 (41 m/s) to go...
You're burning; you're burning.
100 (30.5 m/s) to go. 78 (24 m/s) to go. 50 (15 m/s) to go. 20 (6.1 m/s) to go. Stand by, Tom.
Stop.
OK. I'll null them out.
OK. Beautiful...
Oh, beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.
OK, null them out. Good.
Charlie Brown, Houston. He got the burn off. We're in good shape.
OK. Let me get the - minus 0.3, plus 0.1...
Outstanding. My congratulations to the Snoopy.
plus 0.1, plus 0.1 and 001.3.
Baby, that, made me feel better. Call up Verb 82 when you get a chance.
I will. OK.
OK, and there the AGS says we made a good burn. Go ahead.
Snoop, Houston. We copy the residuals. It looks great.
Roger, Houston. We got it. Oh, Roger. The burn looked real good.
I tell you we're down here where we can touch the top of some of the hills, though.
Houston, under cases like this, it sounds like to me you can relay through him because every time you talk to me I hear him talking in the background,
OK, Char - Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy. It shows us in 46.7 (nautical miles, 86.5 km) by 11.0 (nautical miles, 20.4 km). Over.
Roger. We copy. 46.7 by 11.0.
OK, Tom. Engine Arm Off.
Yes.
AELD Breaker, Open.
I already got...
OK, and mine's Open. Master Arm, off.
Yep.
And Inverter number 2 - number 1 breaker, Open.
Yep.
OK. And the RCS just for the record on 80 and 78
Alrighty. Did you notice that the wobble we got on that burn?
Boy, I tell you I thought we were wobbling all over the sky...
(Laughter)
I'm surprised those residuals ended up where they did.
OK. Yaw 180 and pitch down 90.
Alrighty, let's go off VOX.
Circuit breaker, Rendezvous Radar, Closed.
OK.
Now wait 30 seconds.
OK, going to...
Charlie Brown, Houston. Can you hear that hear them talking when I keep keyed down here. Over.
No, go the other way.
Yes. A lot clearer, I thought, all of a sudden. That was great.
OK. When they start talking, I'll key down here and relay to you. Over. Until you get them again.
OK. That'll be kind of you.
Roger.
Got your breakers closed?
Yes, I'll get the other one in a...
And I'm back on Orb Rate, Tom?
OK.
Put me back on Orb rate, will you?
I'll get it.
That son of a bitch was wild. We got to watch the AGS on CDH.
Oh, ho, ho!
Charlie Brown, Houston. We recommend for your next maneuver that you load the DAP with a half a degree per second. We see 0.2 (degree per second) now. Over.
OK. Roger. I'm going to do that.
OK.
Let's go up and get him.
Yes, I'd still like to know what caused that.
I would too. You got your other breaker Closed, Rendezvous Radar?
Yes, I'll get it Closed.
I don't know what the hell that was, but a - that's better.
OK, Tom. You can pull your circuit breakers.
Your Rendezvous breaker?
OK. Ready to pull it?
Houston. Is he in a 283 by 15.3? Over.
Pull it.
OK.
OK, we'll make a quick alignment, here.
Negative. We've got him at 46.7 by 11.0. Over.
AOT Lamp Breaker, Closed.
Stand by. It's Closed.
Roger. I must have loaded this number backwards. This P76 number backwards.
Roger. We'll send you a TM vector in just a moment. Charlie Brown, we've got your LM vector coming. Stand by.
Alrighty.
Tom, set the Elapsed Timer down on - down on CSI. Here's CSI time because, remember, we got to get that backup mark at 30 minutes.
OK.
And 103:45, we don't have a lot of time. Only got 15 minutes to make this alignment, so I'm going to make it only three marks.
OK.
OK, you can leave it Go, cause I'm going to call up the...
103:45?
I don't know what it is here, babe.
what have we got right now?
You don't have to maneuver; I got to go get a star.
We're in P00 and Accept right now.
OK.
Roger. Copy, Charlie Brown. Stand by. Be a while.
OK. Well, I can do realign in the meantime then.
OK, Tom? Can I go get it?
OK, you're in, what's - what's it? 351? - 35 - yes, it'll pitch you down quite a bit. You can go get it.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Stand by 30 seconds. We'll have the load to you. Over.
Roger. I'll wait.
OK, maneuver. Go.
OK, and here's the time, if you can set that elapsed timer, because we got to get that, bagged - that 30 minute mark that we always miss.
102:55
That was the Earth in there?
Where's CS - oh. Where's CSI, 103:45?
Right, right down here. Right down here on the left.
103:45:34, 43 minutes.
We're there.
Excellent.
Boy, Houston. That's outstanding. Wish we had done that when we were fooling with the GSFC.
Roger (chuckling).
That's a light vehicle, Tom.
Yes, I know it.
Are you done with?
Counting down.
Stand by.
Roger. Charlie Brown, you can take the computer back. We're done with the load. Over.
There ain't any question we don't have an ascent - or descent stage. How's the chamber pressure and everything holding?
Charlie Brown, Houston. We're through with the computer. It's yours. Over.
Thank you much.
Chamber pressure?
You know. Yes, cabin chamber pressure.
Good.
You're welcome.
That's four sets, let's Proceed.
That's more like it.
We're all set. Counting down.
Let me see.
Houston, we're going to Omnis. P52 the rest of it.
Roger. We copy. We want Aft Omnis. Aft Omnis. Over.
Snoop, Houston. Aft Omnis, if you read. Over.
They want you on Aft Omnis, Snoopy.
What'd he say?
Houston wants you on Aft Omnis, Gene.
Tell him that's where I am.
OK. He's on Omnis, Houston. He's on Aft Omnis.
Hold it.
Roger. We copy, Charlie Brown. Are you reading him now, Charlie Brown?
What star did you take?
Altair like we called for in the book.
Yes, I am. Thank you.
Good. OK. Yes, it's looking good.
That's it right there.
Snoop, Houston. Over.
Bang, bang.
Right on the money.
Boy it's a light vehicle.
Boy.
Beautiful! Why don't you write that down? What were the stars, 40...
and 33.
I'll write those down....
Got it?
Yes, and let's make a star check on...
Let's Proceed.
Go ahead.
We're not going to have much time.
No, I just want it right on the same star. On Altair.
Beautiful, Tom. Beautiful...
OK. Let's get...
It's banging around in deadband.
Right on.
OK, let's go track that mother. OK, at minus 33 minutes, you want to be calling up - OK, get your Rendezvous Radar breaker Closed.
AC Rendezvous Radar breaker, Closed. OK, you want to give me - I don't know what the AGS thinks where we are.
OK, right. Here's what the AGS thinks we're at, babe.
AGS - We're not moving.
Houston. Over.
That's where we think we are.
Go ahead, Houston. This is Snoopy.
Roger. We think we can help you psyche out your problem there at staging. It looked like the Mode Control switch was in Auto instead of Att Hold. Over.
God damn! OK. We'll try to recollect it. I thought we went right through our checklist, as prescribed, but if you've got telemetry. That'll sure help.
OK. You got your Rendezvous Radar breakers closed Tom?
Yes.
Huh?
Yep.
That's where the AGS think it is.
God...
Roger.
Hello, Houston. The results of the AOT alignment. Do you read? OK. Plus 4 balls 4; gyro torquing angles are 0, - plus 00311, plus 00121, and plus 00081, and the star check, put her right in the center again.
Roger. We copy.
Snoopy, we're going to acquire - acquire you on VHF again.
OK. We'll be quiet, John.
OK. How didn't we have that in Attitude Hold?
I thought we did, babe. Shh. Be quiet while he's talk-acquiring. He can hear us hot mike.
Yes.
Snoop, Houston. We noticed on your checklist that minus 14 minutes prior to - prior to insertion, we have an omission on the Mode Control switch. It doesn't call out its position there, and we think that's where we ran astray. Over.
I'm ready. I got him here, Gene-o. Go to P20
You got him in Slew? OK.
Snoop, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Tom. Would you like some further amplification on the staging problem? We think the error came at minus 14 minutes where we failed to call out the AGS Mode Control switch into ATT Hold. Over.
OK.
Bitch it. It just won't acquire for us, Tom. Go into - go into - go into Slew and track it again.
Roger.
OK. I'm coming around now, you guys. I'm probably not pointed at you right this second.
Roger, I wondered what happened. We were locked on solid, and the radar slowly faded out. Now it's trying to come in, John, as you pitch up.
OK.
Keep going. The strength is building.
Minus 30 minutes, we need a range rate hack.
OK. you ready to go now? Auto? LGC? Ready?
Yes.
There it goes.
That's more like it.
OK. Weve got a solid lock on it now, John, in P20.
Would you believe this thing was giving you a range in half steps?
Yeah.
OK, we can expect that. Let's take it.
OK.
We need that range rate at 30 minutes.
No. Don't do it Verb... And again: on our first Mark, we see these large updates. We'll reject it and pick up on our second one. Range rate, huh? It's gotta be 290.
Hello, Snoop. Houston. We have a CSI update for you. Over.
OK.
Go ahead with your update.
Roger. It's P32 CSI: 103:45:5460, 105...
Don't forget the range rate.
Got it.
21 0100, plus 0453, plus 000 106, plus 453, plus 000, plus 005. Standing by for your readback. Over.
Give me Noun 81, again. I don't think I got enough numbers.
Roger. Noun 81 is plus 0453 plus 000. Over.
There we go. Good. Proceed.
OK, we'll take that.
Yep.
Stand by, Charlie. I'll give you a readback in a second. This is in CSI and TPI time we'll use. Is that correct?
That's affirmative.
How's the - how's that range look, Tom.
Beautiful.
How about 30 minutes.
Coming up.
What time did they give you, Gene?
Mark, 274 (fps, 83.5 m/s).
What is it?
274 (fps, 83.5 m/s).
OK.
And range is 193 (nautical miles, 357 km).
OK, John, I got CSI TIG is 103:45:54. It really should be right now, because the new clock, right now.
OK, 270 (fps, 82.3 m/s).
270 (fps, 82.3 m/s).
And 192 (nautical miles) (356 km).
Roger. How about TPI time.
105:21:0100.
Roger.
Snoopy, Houston. You broke out on readback after the Noun 11. Over.
Roger. Stand by, and I'll read it back. Let me get things going here, Charlie.
Roger.
I got it up good. Ill read it back in a minute.
Roger.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Over.
How can he hear me. I'm not - I'm not in VOX or anything. How could he hear me?
I'm going to Z-axis track.
How's it looking to you, Tom?
Pretty good.
OK. Those are getting better. Check the signal strength against range. That's what...
Yes, 190? For 200, it's 188 and for 100, it's 22. We're right on.
Charlie Brown, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Charlie Brown. On - we think what happened on your P76 where you got those funny numbers, that you failed to do the final Enter on the Noun 84. Just a reminder to always do the final Enter on the Noun 84, and also when you get a chance, we'd like you to cycle the tunnel vent valve to LM Press for 10 seconds to try to blow out that RTV or whatever's clogging it. Over.
Roger. I tried that this morning.
Roger.
It didn't pass.
Roger. Did you try it after undocking? Over.
Alright. I'll try it. I ain't got a chance right this minute.
There we go.
I just called for a recycle. Let's recycle. Take our first cut at. OK, Tom, did you get our clock counting on - we'll, we'll get it.
Hello, Houston. Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy. Our updates are looking real good now. With respect to Delta-R and Delta-V, and it looks like we're coming right up the pike with respect to range and range rate. Over.
Roger. We copy, Snoop. Over.
Roger.
Roger. OK, Tom, at 20 minutes - I think our 20 minutes is really about 19:30, here. We're about - they changed times on us by - 45, 54, 45 - 20 seconds. So 20 seconds later. OK? And you're saying we got a 45 foot per second CD-CSI.
And we're going to use the interconnects.
That may have been. I thought I looked at that son of a bitch, but God dang. OK, there's Noun 75, that says - that's beautiful.
Hello, Houston. I guess you can read our DSKY on this first recycle after 5 marks.
Roger. We copy.
OK, Noun 81 is 48.7, 0 and 0.
Noun -
Now let's get our clocks set.
OK.
You got him by any chance, Tom?
No.
190 - 180 miles (352 - 333 km), huh?
Yes.
Hello, Houston. That last alignment was based upon 4 sets of marks rather than 5 because of our time to get locked-on and get that 30-minute backup range rate. So, we only took 4 - 4 sets of marks on each star instead of 5.
Roger. Copy. That's OK Snoop. Press on, and Charlie Brown...
Roger.
We're not turning back. now.
Go ahead. Over.
Roger. We copy. Charlie Brown, Snoop, did you copy the Noun 11 Noun 37 info? Over.
Can you imagine this?
Beautiful, look at that, look at that.
I think I got it, Charlie...
Isn't that...
103:45:54 and 105:21.
Don't knock - don't knock out the window, Gene-o.
No, I ain't going to do that, babe.
Son of a bitch! Damn it.
That's empty anyway.
Boy, where's the day gone?
(Laughter) How in the hell...
Snoop, Houston. We'd like you to confirm your Noun 81 Noun 86 info on the CSI PAD. Noun 11 and Noun 37 were entered correctly. We're satisfied with those. Over.
I'm sorry, Charlie. Noun 81 - I still think I got a left-out digit, but I know what you're talking about. Noun 81 is plus 045 point 3 and plus all balls. Is that correct?
That's affirmative.
And the next number is 106 and then Noun 86 is plus 453, plus all balls and plus 0005.
That's - Roger. It's 2 balls 5 on - on the Delta-VZ. Over.
Ohh, Oh.
What's wrong, John? What do you see?
I've got - Y-dot It's plus 6.1 (fps, 1.9 m/s) for Y-dot.
Don't say.
One was 7.0 (fps, 2.2 m/s). It was seven - 0.
Watch, you're out of plane on the ball, babe. We never got gimbal lock.
OK, John. I - I - I kind of - just don't believe that. I've been tracking the radar here. We're going right on the center line of the ball. Let's wait till after CSI and look at it.
OK.
20 minutes, Tom. Give me a mark. Range rate, what do you suppose it was? God dang it.
It was 170 (nautical miles, 315 km).
170. Can you update it a little bit? What do you suppose it was?
That's what I said. That's what I meant to say.
OK. 170 (nautical miles, 315 km).
Sorry, I didn't call it out.
12 minutes, we proceed.
We got beaucoup marks, so...
Let's just let it take marks. We won't even recycle that second time around.
Yes.
I tell you, Tom. I'm tracking you off the center of the ball here.
OK. Well, our ball's right in the center. We'll still have plenty of time, John, after CSI.
OK.
Shall we see what ours is? We ought to be looking at it in about 15 minutes.
John, give me your CSM Y-dot again.
It's plus 6.4 (fps, 1.95 m/s).
OK. I got plus 6.4.
OK, Tom.
Snoopy, Houston. We'll have LOS at 103:36 and AOS at 104:25. Over.
Roger. 103:36, 104:25. Thank you.
OK. Verb 9 - Verb 90 Enter 3, Enter. Plus 00045, Enter. 0.054...
Charlie Brown. Houston. Over.
Let's get it.
0.60, Enter. We're looking right up both balls. We're looking up - we're looking up AGS and PGNS, babe. Of course, I aligned the AGS to the PGNS after the alignment, but that damn alignment was right on. It was right on.
What was that - plus 4.5?
No, that was the time, just coming back at me.
Snoop, Houston. If you get a chance, pass to Charlie Brown, we've lost his TM and voice, and we'll see him AOS at 104:24. Over.
This is Snoopy. Roger. Charlie Brown, this is Snoop, You'll have acquisition at 104:24. Over.
Say again?
Roger. You'll be picking up Houston at 104:24. And our out - of - and out-of-plane was 4.1 and we're tracking...
In the other direction, though...
In the other direction, and we're tracking right up the center line here. But we'll just ignore the first out of-plane correction. Over.
Very good.
Was that AOS at 104:25, Tom?
Yes.
We need another mark at 10 minutes.
Yes.
God-dang it.
Houston, I'm putting you Omnis.
Roger, Gene.
Omni I just had a.
Houston, we've got you on Omnis. You hear that music, Tom? That crazy whistling?
I can hear it.
That's really weird.
It is.
Snoop, Houston. As you go over the hill, you're looking good. Were all Go here.
Roger, Charlie. And we'll hit Proceed at 12 minutes. Everything looking good, we're going to ignore the out-of-plane correction at CSI. Over.
You're not going to do the out-of-plane at CSI?
That's affirmative.
Yes. 17 marks.
Snoop, Houston. Say again. We didn't copy.
Roger. With everything looking good. We're going to ignore the out-of-plane correction at CSI. Over.
Roger. I show you about...
Roger. Understand you are not doing the CSI -the out-of-plane. Over.
I don't if this is or not. Wait till I get ground after CSI.
That's affirmative.
Noun 81 is minus 46.9.
OK, John. I understand: 46 point 9.
Roger. Minus.
OK, that's all right. We know which way we're going to burn it.
We reverse his signs for out-of-plane, right.
Yes. OK, 15.4 miles (28.5 km).
I'd like to know what you guys got.
It's coming up right now. Plus 45.3 (fps, 13.8 m/s).
Beautiful.
OK, so we'll burn our 45.3 (fps, 13.8 m/s). That's exactly what Houston gave us.
Roger.
Proceed
Beautiful.
Hey Snoop, CapCom. We understand you're burning 45.3 (fps, 13.8 m/s). Your FIDO's grinning.
Yeah, it looks just great.
OK, Tom. The clock set up? In 10 minutes I need a range rate mark.
In range, both.
Yep.
We'll see how the backup's come up.
OK. Mark it. It was 103 feet per second (31.4 m/s).
OK, and what's range?
157.5 (nautical miles, 291.7 km).
OK, babe, you can take the computer and go into Verb 47 - proceed out of there, and go to Verb 47. And I'll go to update here.
I got to go to zero, zero (P00), don't I. Enter.
Yes.
47.
Proceed.
I've already been in PC. I'm - I'll figure this one out.
Think we need to put on the helmets and gloves for this one?
I don't think - I don't want to.
Let's me try it Just to see what it's like. That's not really a big thing with helmets and gloves.
This says 52.3.
What'd ground give us?
Am I glad we didn't torque up the platform.
How in the hell did we miss that? Still don't know.
We had to have someone on our side that time.
Yep.
Listen to eerie music.
You - You ready?
Yes, I need - You go into 41.
Yep.
Plus 45.3, 0, and 0.6.
OK, go ahead.
You ready for an Auto maneuver?
Yep.
OK. OK, I'll go ahead and open the Rendezvous Radar circuit breaker.
What happened?
Open the Rendezvous Radars. We're going to pitch down.
Boy, it got quiet.
Huh?
Didn't it? We still got thrusters?
Oh, yeah. Ready? Proceed.
Man, I tell you, it just got quiet.
John, we're going to pitch down and have our X-axis towards you. You may lose our flashing light.
Roger.
John, do you know what we're going to burn now? 43.5 - 45.3, 0, and 0.
Roger.
Those numbers again, Gene-o, are what?
I'll put mine on, Tom.
I tell you, John, that music is really weird.
Think we're going to get it on the front side?
I know it. You don't suppose something, huh?
I don't know, man.
No one will believe us. Okay, Tom, we're set until 35 minutes - 35 seconds. And we're at 4 minutes and 35 from the burn.
We pitch down - know it's right, but why should I have him out there?
You should be looking at 105.
Inertial, huh?
You're not looking at 105 Inertial. Much better.
But why should I have down...
Why should you have what?
Jose down below me.
You've got him below you? Where is he?
Maybe it's a reflection. You got him out there?
No.
Something's weird. Go ahead. OK.
If you didn't have an Orb Rate ball, you couldn't tell where you...
You wouldn't know where the hell you were. I'm looking at 270, and my Orb Rate ball, according to this thing, is pretty good, Tom. And we just updated it: 258.
Good.
That looks good.
OK. I show you 3 minutes to burn.
That's right.
OK, I'll give you mark at 3 minutes, John - 7 seconds.
3 - 2 - 1.
Mark it.
3 minutes. You with us?
Yes, sir. Right in sync.
That's weird. Why should I see him down there?
OK Tom, we're going to use the Ascent Feed on this one.
Yes. TTCA's Enabled.
And mine is Disabled.
You got the AGS loaded?
The AGS is loaded and counting. When you start, I am going to open the ascents and close the solenoids, so I'll get them closed in plenty of time. I'm going to start closing them at 10 feet per second.
OK.
That is weird.
Hey, Tom, you want me to trim final?
Yes. Trim it.
Ready?
Go.
Boy, those are hard to reach. Coming up on 1 minute, John.
Roger.
