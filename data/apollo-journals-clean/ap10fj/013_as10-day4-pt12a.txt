Hello. Apollo 10, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. This is 10. Over.
Roger, 10. We have a problem with the Goldstone. We won't acquire the 210-foot [64-metre] dish, until 72:49. That means that we'll have to get the color down through the 85-foot [26-metre] dish at Goldstone at 72:14. Now, we're not sure just exactly how good the color quality will be through the 85, so we can work it your choice on the thing. We can go, as scheduled, at 72:20 and see what the quality of the color is, and if it's bad and it won't impact your time line, we suggest that you then delay until 72:50 when we pick up the 210 and try another show. Also, that would give us - At this time you are in the lunar umbra and your friendly geologist [scientist-astronaut Harrison Jack Schmitt], here, says that there should be a spectacular shot looking right through the Moon into the solar corona. Over.
Houston, this is 10. We're kicking around shooting the TV at the solar corona. I don't know. Do you think the thing would handle it? Seems like it would damage it, from the light standpoint.
Stand by. Everybody is shaking their heads back here - the experts. As long as the Sun is completely down, or completely set, it should be all right. We'll be looking at just a shafting from around the Moon. We think it'll be all right; you could probably take a peek out your window and if it looks all right to you, then you could turn the camera over that way.
We don't see the Sun. We don't see it.
[Garble]. [Long pause.]
[Garble].
[Garble] six.
Roger, 10. We're just barely reading you, Tom. We are looking at your display: 29 - for perilune of 2906. You are very scratchy, 10; at least Tom is. Almost unreadable. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is 10. Radio check. Over.
Roger. You are five-by, John. Over.
Roger.
Roger, Charlie. How do you read me now? Over.
Roger, Tom. You are five-by. Over.
Okay. Real fine.
[Garble].
Roger, 10. Go ahead. Over.
[Garble].
10, you - You'll have to say again, Tom. You're barely readable. Over.
[Garble] our distance to the Moon and our present velocity.
Roger. Understand. You want distance to the Moon and distance to the Earth. Over.
That's affirmative. Distance from the Earth, distance to the Moon and our present velocity.
Roger, 10. Tom, you're five-by now. You are breaking up; a couple of your transmissions have been barely readable. This last one was five-by.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Hello, 10. Houston. Your present distance from the Earth is 208,950 [nautical] miles [386,975 km]. Distance from the Moon, 9,813 [nautical miles, 18.174 km], with a velocity relative to the Earth of 3,013 feet per second [919 m/s]. Over.
Roger, Houston. I have that copied down. Thanks a lot.
Roger. [Pause.]
Hello, 10. Houston. We're standing by for your decision on the TV. Over. [Long pause.]
Okay. We'll give you an external shot at 00:20 minutes.
Roger. Standing by for the TV.
Hello, Houston. The tube is on right now.
Roger, 10. Stand by. We don't have a picture yet. Over. [Long pause.]
We're in the process of handing over to Goldstone. Goldstone as yet has not received your signal and we'll let you know. Over.
Okay. We've got a beautiful picture on our monitor this morning.
Good show, 10. Over.
Give us a hack when you're getting a picture, would you please?
Roger, 10. We'll do that. Stand by. I'll give you some word on the Goldstone acquisition.
Okay. If they don't have it before too long, we'll go ahead and terminate it.
Roger, 10. If you'll stand by for 2 seconds, we'll give you an estimate of acquisition time. We're supposed to have it at 72:14. So far, they haven't got a signal through the 85. [Long pause.]
Houston, while you're waiting for Goldstone, we'll just keep locked-on here. We'd still like to have you check with GUIDO why we have a 290 - a 290.6 perilune, there, on our Verb 82.
Roger. Stand by, 10. [Long pause.]
Hello, 10. Houston. The big pericynthion number is due to the conic integration in the Verb 82. At these distances, the GUIDO's are not disturbed. They say that's a normal reaction to that integration, There is a way you can get a better number. If you'd like us to pass it up to you, we'll give it to you. Over.
We can take P21 to about the middle of the LOI burn. That ought to tell us.
That's the way we were going to suggest, 10. Over.
Okay.
Okay. We figured it was strictly due to the conic, but we just wanted to give it a recheck.
Roger. [Pause.]
Hello, 10. Houston. We suggest your GET for the P21, if you're going to run it, is 76:00:14. Over.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 10. Do we have anything through Madrid at this time? The Goldstone isn't locked-on. Over.
10, Houston. We have a Madrid acquisition and they are getting a picture recorded on tape. Goldstone lockup is estimated in another 10 minutes. So, it's dealer's choice on whether to terminate or not.
Okay. We will knock it off now. Let us know when you have acquisition. We will give it to them for just a short bit in about 10 minutes. Tell us when. We don't want to just keep holding the camera here. We have a few other things to do. We will give it to them in 10 minutes for a short while. Over.
Roger, 10. We suggest you hold off until we get acquisition, and we will give you the word on acquisition at Goldstone. Over.
All right. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 10. If you can read our DSKY, we now show 61.8-mile [114.5 km] perilune. It looks pretty good.
Roger. We copy.
Just like you guys said.
Hello, Apollo 10. Houston. Goldstone has a good acquisition. We're Go for TV. Over.
Okay, Charlie. We'll get you going right now.
Roger.
Hello, Houston. Apollo 10. Our monitor shows a good picture of the Earth. How are you doing?
10, we haven't got our signal yet. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Okay. Apollo 10, Houston. We're getting it in black and white now. Stand by for the color. [Long pause.]
We've got the color now, Apollo 10. We have the Earth, and the center of the section. It seems to have a bluish tinge to the background. We see a very bright blue - a pale blue I should say, in the center of the Earth right near the terminator. Could you describe that for us? Over.
Right. You can see the South Atlantic Ocean there and the orange spot to the right is the North African continent. You can see basically the Sahara Desert and, above that, the Mediterranean Sea. The rest of the world is pretty much encased in clouds. The solid cloud cover that's covered the North Pole, and most of Europe, is still with us today. At this time, as we look at the Earth, we are 210,000 miles [389,000 km] away. We've only got about 9,000 miles [16,700 km] to go to the Moon and we're traveling approximately 2,500 miles an hour [4,600 kph] relative to the Earth. Also, in about 15 minutes we will enter the shadow of the Moon and make our major burn to enter lunar orbit in approximately 3 hours. Now, at this distance, the Earth looks slightly smaller than a tennis ball to us and a little bit larger than a golf ball. And I hope it shows up the same way on your screen.
10, it's a...
...And again, South Africa - Go ahead, Charlie.
Roger. I was just going to add that we can see the northern part of Africa. We had a bluish tint to it at first but now it's coming in to a sort of orangish brown and we can see the South Atlantic and the cloud covers very well. The colors are very good. Over.
Roger. Again, the Sahara Desert, the Atlas Mountains, Morocco, Libya we can see from here. It is an orange brownish orange. The night time - the terminator has cut across the Suez Canal and most of Egypt and is now covering most of South Africa. I can see Spain. It is a greenish brown and is completely contrasted with respect to North Africa. However, you may have difficulty seeing it on your set due to resolution at this distance. Again, you can see Brazil, but it is covered mostly with clouds at this time.
Roger 10. We haven't - We can see...
...At this time Apollo 10...
...Go ahead. Go ahead, 10.
Roger. This - Roger. At this time Apollo 10 is going through the preparation for the Lunar Orbit Insertion burn, and the next - After we lose contact with the Earth, the next time that we come around, we will - To have contact with the Earth, we'll be at approximately a 60- by 170-mile [111- by 315-km] orbit around the Moon. Right now, we cannot see the Moon, even though it is rapidly accelerating us towards itself by its mass. Over.
Roger, Tom. We copied. A very good description. We have difficulty seeing any landmass in our picture except for North Africa, and we can see the terminator cutting across Africa. Europe - The landmasses of Europe, are - just sort of fade into a bluish color. It looks like an ocean to us. Over.
Right. Really, the only major landmass we can see is exactly what you can see on your set there. And that is the North African continent. Most of Europe is covered either by high clouds or some scattered low clouds and it's very difficult for us to see it, too. We'll give you a quick shot on the interior now, and then we'll terminate this pass. We'll go inside now.
Roger. Very good. Thank you very much for the view. We'll be standing by for the inside.
Hello, Apollo 10. Houston. You are coming in on the black and white monitor now. [Long pause.]
10, we have the color now. The resolution on the 85 is, I think, better than most expected here. The Sun is pretty bright in the background, coming in through the - I guess that's the hatch window. No; side window, I guess it is. The patch is visible but it's pretty dark, due to the background being so bright. [Long pause.]
10, do you read? Over.
Go ahead, Charlie.
Roger. Thought we had lost voice there for a moment. You're coming in five-by, now. We've got your arm patch now. That's very dim at this setting. We had Gene's smiling face there for a minute, along with your patch. The flag is coming in a little bit better now. However, it's still pretty dark due, to the bright background. That's a lot better, there, 10. Over. [Long pause.]
There. We have a good view now. Now we can see Gene again. [Long pause.]
We see you waving, Gene. Barbara is in the viewing room. She says "Hi."
A little difficult to get the proper lighting up here, Charlie. Spots flood it out, and we've got to deflect the light.
Roger. We see you trying hard on the thing. It looks like the ALC [Automatic Light Compensation] is averaging out, and the background looks real good - the spacecraft, back along the hatch. Tom's hand covering his window is real clear; his face is dark, though. Over.
That's those whiskers, there, Charlie.
I see. Thank you very much, John. That wasn't quite...
That's known as a 72-hour shadow, Charlie.
Yes, sir. [Long pause.]
Apollo 10, Houston. We now have the 210 at Goldstone. The granularity and the resolution is a heck of a lot better here. You're coming in real great. Over.
Okay.
There's our overhead hatch window there. [Pause.]
10, Houston. We see some specks on your hatch window. Could you comment on those? [Pause.]
Yes. They come from the dumps that we're making overboard as we progress along. I don't think any of it is due to the thruster firing, Charlie.
Roger.
Houston, the hatch window is phenomenally clear. There is what appear to be a few dump particles on the outside, maybe a couple of smear prints on the inside. The right-hand window has got a little bit of a smear on the outside; not necessarily particles, but just a general smear. The left-side window has got some definite particles lashed across it.
We're not very good at this camera work, but we will probably improve with practice.
We will show you the navigator down in the LEB.
Roger, 10. We have no complaints at all. That's a pretty good show.
He's the star of the cast because he gets all the good light down there.
Roger. There's old John's friendly face.
(Laughter.) [Pause.]
John's pointing right now at the sextant and the telescope, which are our navigation means to get home. And, hopefully, to do part of the rendezvous.
Yes. This is the best-working part of the whole machine. It's really working beautifully, now.
Got a good operator. [Pause.]
10, Houston. Show us the piece of tape that you have around the eyepiece.
One on the bottom of the sextant and on the righthand side of the telescope.
Roger. Thank, you much, 10. We see it. [Long pause.]
You know, once you lose that thing in here and you have to look for it for about 20 minutes, you find a way not to lose it again.
Well, it wasn't quite 20 minutes but it sure was a scramble going for it, I'll tell you that.
Roger. We copy. We have you entering the lunar penumbra at this time. Do you notice the Sun setting at all? Over.
Can't see the Sun right now, Charlie.
Roger.
We're not in the right attitude to see it.
In this attitude, to look at the Earth and everything, we can't get a picture of the Sun that we can see. If there is any solar corona, we will give it a quick shot.
Roger. Jack is estimating you will have about 30 seconds only. Over.
Okay, Charlie. It appears that the Sun's reflection on Snoopy, here, is getting a little bit dimmer. So we very well could be where you [think] we are. I hope we are.
Your friendly FIDO's will bet on it.
[Garble] some navigating here.
Yes. I guess we are too, aren't we?
Roger. [Pause.]
I never doubted them, anyway. I just - Like I said yesterday, I'll wait until I see that 60 nautical miles [111 km].
10, Houston. Does it look any different upside-down there?
The stars are 180 out of the position they were before.
That's one thing about this environment. If you don't like it, just turn it upside-down.
Roger, 10.
Okay, Charlie. We will terminate this pass with one quick look outside to see how the 210-foot dish looks at the Earth from outside. Okay?
Roger, 10. We are standing by. Over. [Long pause.]
Charlie? It's definitely getting a little darker outside.
Roger, 10. That's good news. Over.
Looks like we're right on trajectory, then. Okay. Here's another look at the Earth through the 210-foot dish at Goldstone, and I hope the colors are coming through a little better. Again, the west coast of North Africa is still a bright orange, and the central part of North Africa is starting to turn purple as night-time approaches over the western part of Libya and the eastern part of Tunisia. Again, it's awful hard to see Spain because Spain is a greenish brown this morning. You have the Mediterranean and the Atlantic covered with some clouds, so it's awful hard to see any part of Spain. But again, the Earth to us this morning looks a little bit smaller than a tennis ball as we're 210,000 miles [389,000 km] from the Earth and now less than 9,000 miles [16,700 km] to go to the Moon. This is Apollo 10, signing off. We'll see you later today.
Thank you much for a good show, 10. Appreciate it. The 210-foot dish is giving us a very good resolution and the colors are a lot sharper. Over. [Pause.]
Okay, Charlie. We are definitely in darkness, right at this moment. It just went pitch dark outside.
Roger...
...Lost all the Sun.
Roger. We Copy, 10.
Boy, that - That's really something, after having the Sun out of one window all the time. We are in total darkness. [Long pause.]
That total darkness occurred about 72:55:00.
Roger, 10. We were predicting about 72:53. Over. That's pretty close, we think. Over.
Charlie, I can just see a little bit of reflected sunlight now out on the left thrusters. I believe it's probably from the Earth over on the left side.
Roger, 10. We think it might be Earthshine. We have an update to your LOI-1 burn card. Over.
Stand by a second.
Roger. No hurry on this.
Hello. Houston. Houston, this is 10. How do you read.
Reading you five-by 10. Go ahead. Over.
Hello, 10. Houston. We just had a handover to Goldstone. Do you read now? Over.
Oh, yes. I thought that was us: We're back on High Gain and Narrow Beam, Charlie.
Roger. 10. Network has just advised that we won't hand over until 73:05. Over.
You will not hand over until 73:05. Okay. And what is that update you have for us?
Roger. It's two of them. One for your LOI burn card. We have some updates to your angles. And we have a map update, rev number 1. Over.
Okay. Give me the rev 1 first, Charlie.
Roger. LOS is 075:48:25, 075:52:52, 076:22:58. Over.
Okay. I've got map update, rev 1: 075:48:25, 075:52:52, and 076:22:58.
Roger. That was a good readback. Over.
Okay. And go ahead with your update on the preliminary LOI.
Roger. It's on your burn card that you have. It's an update to the roll, pitch, and yaw angles. Roll is now 179 degrees, pitch 68 - that's 068, yaw is 011. Over.
Okay. Charlie. That must be for the abort card, right?
That's affirmative, 10. Over. [Pause.]
Roger. Roger.
Okay, Charlie. I got roll 179, pitch is 068, and yaw is 011 on the LOI 15-minute abort card.
That's affirmative, 10. Over.
Okay.
The LM is bright as day, courtesy Earthshine.
Roger. Understand you are getting a lot of Earthshine up there, 10. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 10, this is Houston. It looks like you're drifting into the limit on the High Gain Antenna. You will be handling the Omnis on board. Looks like you are coming up on Omni Delta for max signal strength. Over.
Okay, Bruce. Thank you.
Roger. Out.
Houston, Apollo 10. As you can see, we've made just a couple of pulses, and we're slowly drifting over to our LOI-1 attitude.
This is Houston. Roger. Out.
Hello, Houston. This is 10.
Go ahead - Go ahead, 10. Over.
Okay. Reservicing has started, and I'm at the part where I've got the water flow on. I'll keep it on for 2 minutes.
Roger. We copy.
Hello, 10. Houston. We show 2 minutes on the water. It looks like you got some water into the evaporator. We suggest you turn it off. Over.
[Garble]. Understand you don't want me to activate it at this time? I just went to Auto on the steam pressure and the waterflow.
Roger. That's the correct procedure. Over.
Okay. That's where we are right now, and I'm reading about 0.23 on my steam pressure.
Roger. We copy. Over...
...down, below, about 44 degrees. About 44 degrees on the Glycol Evap out Temp.
Roger.
Hello, Houston - correction - Hello, Apollo 10. Houston. We have your final LOI-1 PAD ready to go and your P27 update. If you're ready to go with this, we are too. Over.
Roger. I'll - For the P27 update, I'll go into CMC Accept now.
Roger.
You're in Accept. Over.
Roger, 10. Out. [Pause.]
Okay, Charlie. I'm ready for the final LOI-1, and make it a good one.
Roger, 10. This is LOI-1. SPS/G&N: 62554; plus 0.95, minus 0.17; 075:55:53.31; Noun 81 is minus 2913.8, minus 0561.2, minus 0229 - correction - 0299.7; 355, 230, 342; apogee is 0169.2, plus 0059.5; 2982.4, 5:54, 2975.2; sextant star is 16, 214.6, 39.4. The rest of the PAD is NA. Okay, your set stars are the same; your roll align is 241, 240 and 013; no ullage. The LM weight is the same. Over.
Stand by one. [Long pause.]
Houston, this is 10 with the readback.
Go ahead.
LOI-1 is SPS/G&N: 62554, plus 0.95, minus 0.17; 075:55:53.31; minus 2913.8, minus 0561.2, minus 0299.7; 355, 230, 342; 0169.2, plus 0059.5; 2982.4, 5:54, 2975.2; 16, 214.6, 39.4; rest of PAD is NA. We've got Vega, 36; Deneb, 43; roll is 241, pitch is 240, yaw is 013; no ullage, and the LM weight is 30727.
That was a good readback, 10. Gene, how was my readup? Was it too slow, too fast, or - comments. Over.
No. Very good, Charlie. Just right.
Roger. Out. [Pause.]
Houston, Apollo 10. The uplink is coming through in good shape, and I wish you'd pass on to Jack Schmitt this message. The message is 'Would you believe the minimum stop on the 250-mm lens is 5.6. We do not have an f:4 on the 250mm. Over.
Roger, 10. We'll pass that on to him. And if no LOI-1 burn, you can expect AOS at 076:12:21.
Okay. Without an LOI burn, AOS will be 076:12:21.
Affirmative. Out. [Long pause.]
Hello, Apollo 10. Houston. We have your target load and state vector in. The computer is yours. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Hello, Apollo 10. Houston. Do you have any questions about the standard setting for the 250-millimeter lens in lunar orbit. Over.
No. It looks like we're going to have to use an f:56 and 1/25 since the 250-mm lens doesn't have an f:4 on it.
Roger, Tom. I was just talking to Jack here, and he says we would like to use an f:5.6 at 1/250, except near the terminator, and then and then stop - then go down to 1/125. Over.
Okay. We'll do that.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 10. Houston. We'd like to give you a hack on your mission timer. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, 10. On my Mark it will be 74 hours, 14 minutes even. Stand by.
Mark.
74:14.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 10. We're synced right on with you.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 10.
Go ahead, 10.
Roger. Been reading our DSKY?
Roger. Sure have. That shows the star angle difference and the P52 and also the torquing angles. Over.
Roger. Looks real good. We've also done our sextant star check, and we're right on. And, we've pulsed around here to the maneuver attitude, and we're just standing by.
Roger, 10. We show you in attitude. And, 10, Houston. We have an hour and 26 minutes to LOS. Over.
Roger. 1 plus 26 to LOS. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 10. Do you have any updates as to when we'll have a sunrise on this pass?
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Hello, 10. Houston; We show sunrise at 74 hours and 50 minutes and 11 seconds. Over.
Roger. 74:50:11.
Hello, Houston. Apollo 10.
Go ahead, 10. Over.
I cycled the cryo fans at about 71 hours. Should we go ahead and cycle them again before this burn?
Stand by. [Long pause.]
Hello, Apollo 10. Houston. We'd like you to stir up the cryos again when you normally do it in the preburn checklist. Over.
Okay. Fine. And, Houston, in looking at the Earth right now, looking at the South Atlantic off the coast of South America, in about the center of the globe, is a brilliant, bright, very, very bright reflective light. You can see it with the naked eye, and then again see it with the monocular; it's a very brilliant spot, just a spot, intense light from the Earth.
Roger. In the South Atlantic, 10? Over.
Yes. I think it looks to me like it's right smack in the middle of the subsolar point. Just a continuous white, bright, brilliant light - just a pinpoint. [Long pause.]
10, Houston. We'll check it out with the guys in the back, and see if they think that's the subsolar point or just a reflection - angle of incidence type thing. Over.
I'm sure it's just a reflection, but it's the first time I've ever seen anything like that.
Roger. We'll see if we can come up with some ideas...
As a matter of fact, it's - Okay. The brilliance of the light is just now fading, and it definitely is in the middle of the subsolar point and it's - the reflect - the reflection is totally gone at this time.
Roger. Copy.
But what it was there was bright and brilliant.
Copy. Over. [Long pause.]
Hello, Apollo 10. Houston. We have two Comm switches for you that will put you in lunar orbit comm configuration. These are S-Band Auxiliary to Downvoice Backup and Tape Recorder Forward to Forward. Over.
Roger, Charlie. Do you want those now?
That's affirmative, 10. Over. [Pause.]
Okay. Tape Recorder to Forward; and I'll go Downvoice Backup. Does that also mean you want the Voice switch to Off?
That's negative, 10. Over.
Okey doke. We are now in Downvoice Backup; Tape Recorder is Forward and that was the only two changes.
That's affirmative, 10. And we've polled the room and you are Go for LOI. Over.
Thank you.
Hello, sunshine - Here comes the sunshine.
Well, we copy, 10. At 74:50 thereabouts.
That's right. It's nice to have a little pad of darkness in there to go out there and do a good alignment where you can nicely recognize the constellations.
Roger. We copy, 10.
How do they compare with the CMS [Command Module Simulator]?
These stars are better. [Long pause.]
Would you like another reset point?
We'll take one next time around, Gordo. I'll bet it looks like Vulture's Row down there today, doesn't it?
Yes. You can't stir them with a stick down here.
We just turned a page in the Flight Plan, and we certainly appreciate the insert that you put in there.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 10. Now, we still have a beautiful view of the Earth right out through the center hatch window. It was just a little bit smaller than a tennis ball this morning; it's right now about the size of a hand ball.
Roger. We copy, 10. That's a pretty good eye.
Don't let them kid you, Charlie; it looks like a dime to me.
Chris says when it gets to look the size of a squash ball, let him know.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 10. Houston. We'd like you to select Omni Charlie so we can get a couple of minutes of high bit rate. Over.
Houston, this is 10. You ought to have Omni Charlie now.
Roger, 10. We're reading you five-by. Out. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 10. We'll start through the P30-P40 series at approximately 75:30. Over.
Roger, 10. We copy. We'll be watching.
Okay, Charlie.
Houston, Apollo 10. We'll start through the P30-P40 series now. Over.
Roger, 10. Standing By. Over. [Long pause.]
Okay. And we know what that is. That is due to the conic integration.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 10 [garble] we can read our DSKY. We've trimmed and we're in a trim attitude and, as far as our checklist, we're minus 6 minutes and waiting.
Roger. We copy, 10. We have you holding at minus 6 minutes. [Long pause.]
10, Houston. One reminder. We really - on the high bit rate, it's 30 seconds. Over. Before for the burn.
Roger. Understand. Go to high bit rate. We've got that on our checklist, but we'll make sure we go there 30 seconds prior to the burn.
Roger.
Houston, we've got a bunch of clocks running in here; but just in case, give us a sync hack in 10 minutes, will you?
Roger. We'll give you a hack at 10 minutes. Over.
Houston, Apollo 10. Just tried looking out as far as I can out the top hatch window, and still can't see the Moon; but we'll take your word that it's there. Over.
Roger, 10. That's guaranteed it's there. Over.
Okay. [Pause.]
We know it's there. I hope it's there plus 60 miles [111 km].
No guarantee on that.
Our Trench guys guarantee 60 by 170 [111 by 315 km] on your - if you can burn on the P40 number.
Man, the beer's on me, if it's 60 by 170 [111 by 315 km].
We'll take that.
And if it ain't, we don't have to worry, about it.
Which one, Tom?
[Garble] I got [garble]. It'll probably come down during the burn.
Ain't going to pull a quarter of a g.
And - and when do we lose them - at - at 48, huh?
Yes, 48.
48 what? 50 something?
48 - Tom's got it there - 25...
Do they want us to proceed to be in that [garble] 60 40 before we lose them?
No, I don't want to do that.
[Garble] to have a little gimbal [garble].
We can't; we got to turn on the gimb - we have - turn on the - run through the gimbal drive check.
Yes, yes.
This is what's important, if it comes out at that angle. That's it; the gauge right there.
Yes.
Apollo 10, Houston. On my Mark, it'll be 10 minutes to ignition. Over.
10. Roger. [Pause.]
Apollo 10, stand by for a Mark, 10 minutes.
Mark.
Ten minutes to ignition.
We're synced.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, let's go do it.
Okay. The BMAGs were On; the SCS Electronics, On...
Apollo 10, Houston...
...[garble] power's On...
Two minutes to LOS; everybody here says "God speed."
Okay, and we'll see them right on the other side in orbit.
