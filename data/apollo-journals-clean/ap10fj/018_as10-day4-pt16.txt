This thing ain't going to be shut. You know?
That was the finest sleep I could get. Have you got all that information? Oh, you don't?
Huh?.
Reacq mode's been working like a charm.
Yes. Yes.
Do what?.
Reacq?.
Yes.
("The Best Is Yet to Come" played here.)
Apollo 10, Houston. Reveille Reveille!
Roger. Understand reveille. I didn't think that sounded like the Marine Corps Hymn there, the music that was coming up. But it did sound pretty good.
Roger, 10. We copy. Go ahead and have your breakfast, and we're ready to go when you are.
We're a bit ahead of schedule. We've already had breakfast and gone through the redundant component check.
Roger. We have a consumables update and Flight Plan update when you are ready.
Go ahead.
Roger. Your consumables update valid at 93 hours; your RCS total was 77 per cent: quad A, 75 per cent; quad B, 81 per cent; quad C, 77 per cent; D, 81 per cent...
Go ahead, Houston, with the consumable and Flight Plan update, Jack.
Apollo 10, Houston. How do you read?
Apollo 10, Apollo 10. Houston. Over.
We read you loud - We read you loud and clear, Jack.
Apollo 10, Apollo 10, Houston. Your consumables...
We read you loud and clear.
update follows. Valid at 93 hours: RCS total, 77 per cent; quad A, 70 - 75 per cent; quad B, 81 per cent; quad Charlie, 77 per cent; quad Delta, 81 per cent. That's 8 per cent ahead of your Flight Plan. Your H2 totals 34.5 pounds, O2 totals 435 pounds. Over.
Roger. We got it.
Roger, 10. I have a Flight Plan update when you are ready.
Okay. Go ahead with it. Over
Okay. At the end of your postsleep checklist, add these items. At 93 plus 45, terminate battery B charge. At 93:50, dump waste water to 36 per cent. I repeat, to 36 per cent. All lunar orbit activities are about 12 minutes later than the Flight Plan. I have your nominal burn times, if you want them.
No. We'll get that later, Jack, thank you.
Houston. Roger.
Okay. That was terminate battery B charge on waking up and dump the waste water to 36 per cent.
Roger, 10. That's affirmative.
Is that all the update? Over.
Roger, 10. That's the end of the update.
Okay. Thank you.
Good morning, smiling Jack.
Good morning. You boys have been up a while, I see.
Yes. We tried to sneak up on it just by - just about a half hour or so. Or more.
Roger, 10. I know you're busy. If you have some time to listen sometime when you are interested, I have the local newspaper, again.
Go ahead. We would like to listen to it.
Okay. One kind of interesting thing was John's horoscope this morning; says, "Everybody you know has something helpful to offer. Listen carefully while you make the rounds quickly. Put in a busy day and assemble your results in the evening." Now here goes the news. Springfield, Massachusetts: students at Springfield Technical College told President Edmund T. Garvey they were taking over the Administration Building. Garvey was nonplussed. The students, about 40 in number, marched into the building Wednesday night armed with mops, brooms, scrub brushes, and staged a "clean-in." They said they would clean all night. A student spokesman said the clean-in at the 1,200-member campus was to support the administrative policies of the 2-year-old school. Safi, Morocco: on Friday, Thor Heyerdahl will set out from here to cross the Atlantic in a papyrus boat. The man who must keep his papyrus boat together with rope and string bought his third wife this year, and is now complaining about the price. She cost about 60 dollars in Egypt, much more than the going rate in Chad, where Abu Debrine learned how to make papyrus boats and hitched onto Heyerdahl's expedition. If he succeeds in reaching Mexico in his boat, modeled after a 4,700-year-old Egyptian craft, Heyerdahl will consider he has strengthened the argument that the great early civilization of the Americas learned from the Pharaohs. Debrine is packing pictures of wives A and B, smiling side by side, into his kit for the reed boat trip. A photo of wife C, who has less seniority but is more expensive, gets a less prominent place. Good grief, Charlie Brown. Paris: Allied negotiators headed into the Vietnam talks today with what sources close to the meeting said were optimistic that discussions of proposals by President Nixon and the Viet Cong could bring progress. U.S. delegation sources said Henry Cabot Lodge, Chief U.S. negotiator, would comment, on the Viet Cong's 10-point peace plan Washington said included some points meriting further study. The chief North Vietnamese negotiator indicated he and his Viet Cong counterpart were still studying the Nixon eight-point proposal. Washington: Warren E. Burger, an Appeals Court judge with a reputation for being strong on law and order, was picked Wednesday by President Nixon to be Chief Justice of the United States. Burger, 61, a member of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington since he was appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956, is known as a strict constructionist, the type of judge Nixon promised to elevate to the court during his campaign, last fall. Plymouth, England: solo around the world sailor, Nigel Tetley, was pulled from the Atlantic by a tanker crew today when his boat sank 14 days from home. Tetley's wife, on hearing the news, said, "It is our home that is gone. All my pots and pans have gone to the bottom of the sea." Tetley was competing in a global race sponsored by a London newspaper. Moscow: Moscow TV showed the Apollo 10 astronauts in a 1-minute broadcast. It said it was live from the American space capsule. And do you remember that unemployed local philosopher? He now says that while he believes in the future of color television, he thinks that because of your flight, it will go round and round in people's minds for a while yet. Here is a sports story: Houston 3, Montreal 2, and Houston has just climbed out of the cellar. New York 5, Atlanta 0; Chicago at Los Angeles, a night game; just heard from the back room that Los Angeles beat Chicago. Over.
Boo!
Apollo 10, Houston. We've got a couple of items here we'd like your help on. We have a temperature rise in the helium tank in quad Alpha, so what we'd like you to do after LOS, we'd like you to roll 180 degrees and then come back to the normal attitude at AOS for S-band acquisition. In addition, we'd like your crew status report, and we'd like you to include some information on the cabin environment during the night to see if there is any change in it since the evaporators were not on the line. Over.
Yes. It was fine. Its normally chilly self. We didn't need to turn off all that stuff.
10, Roger.
Okay. Could we have an update on when you expect LOS? Over.
Okay, 10. LOS is going to be at 93:42, and AOS will be at 94:29. Over.
Roger. 93:42 and 94:29.
Okay, Jack. On that roll, do you want a roll to 180 degrees, or roll a Delta angle of 180 degrees?
10, we want you to roll a Delta angle of 180 degrees.
Okay. That's what I figured; just trying to clarify it, though.
Roger, 10.
Jack, the ECS redundant component check is complete, and it looks good from here.
Roger, 10. We copy.
Jack, crew status report: We all had about six pretty good hours of sleep. We've eaten breakfast this morning, and the readings on the dosimeters are, in order, 26037, 05307, 15039.
Okay, Gene. Copy 6 hours sleep and 26037, 05307, 15039. Thank you.
The cryo fans have been cycled, redundant component check is complete. I'm about ready to purge the H2 here in about 5 minutes, and then we'll get the battery and the water dump here before too long. I might take the batteries off the line, that charge off the line, maybe 10 - 15 minutes early, if it's compatible with our suiting up and everything.
Roger. We copy. And the battery action is all right by us.
Okay.
Apollo 10, Houston. We'd like you to cycle the heaters on the hydrogen cryo tanks; number 1, Off; number 2, Auto. Over.
1, Off and 2, Auto, Jack.
Roger. Thank you.
And I'm ready to purge the fuel cells. I'll start with fuel cell 3, oxygen then hydrogen.
Roger. We copy. We're standing by.
Apollo 10, Houston. I have a map update for rev 10 if you want it.
Hold it just a minute, Jack.
Hello, Houston. This is 10. Are you reading us?
That's affirm. Loud and clear.
Okay, fine.
Houston, the fuel cell purge is complete, the H2 purge line heater is Off, and I'd like to go ahead and terminate battery B charging at the time.
Roger. We copy. Stand by one on the batt. Apollo 10, Houston. You are clear to terminate battery charge.
Okay. Thank you, Jack.
Apollo 10, Houston. We'd like you to verify that all the fans are off in the cryo tanks. Over.
Negative, Jack. I had them cycling. Thank you. I'll turn them off at this time.
Houston. Roger.
I got too many meters running, I guess, right now.
Take your time, but hurry.
Jack, give me another hack on when LOS is, would you, and AOS?
All right. LOS is at 93:42. AOS is at 94:29. And I have your map updates for 10 and 11 when you're ready.
Okay, Jack. Go ahead.
Okay. Map update, rev 10: 093:42:40, 093:54:35, 094:28:50; sunrise 093:52:22, sunset 095:04:46. Rev 11: 095:41:06, 095:52:52, 096:27:16, sunrise 095:50:58, sunset 097:03:22. Over.
Okay, Jack I got all those and good, I don't - I don't need to read them back.
Houston. Roger.
I think we're in pretty good shape except for the waste-water dump which we've got yet to go right now.
Roger. We copy. And you're dumping to 36 per cent.
Okay. We'll dump to 36.
Houston, we're starting the waste-water dump now.
Roger, 10. We copy.
Apollo 10. Houston. We wanted to remind you to actuate your GDC, optics power and potable water. Over.
Okay. Optics power coming on right now and potable water, GDC On.
stand up.
You know see?
see it coming down through the...
Yes.
Got it?
Apollo 10, Houston. We're going to lose you around the corner. We'll pick you up in about 46 minutes.
Okay. To give you a status, we've got two guys - one suited - John's getting suited. I'm on my way to the LM here as soon as we complete the waste-water dump.
Roger.
Oh, Just a minute, John.. Let's see; who's got...
today with the suit off. Feels good...
Okay.
I've got my helmet bags, and I'm all suited and ready to go. watch that while you.
Yes.
You what?
I can file these things out of the way, that we don't need. He's got, the Flight Plan. Now we got....
OK. Let me have them here, Gene-o; and you can...
How about giving me my - You going to take that whole checklist over there? Just leave me the activation; that's all I need.
OK, babe. I'll be following you on the schedule.
What? I put it down where it was supposed to be, on that bag.
Hey, turn off the waste-water pump; turn off the vent, John. Huh?
What's there? OK.
What, John? Yes. Yes, we did he did? I thought he terminated! Okay. I'll go to SPS.
From 135.
I can't get.
135 to 215.
I'm going to put my toothbrush down here. Did I - I put it over here, John??
Coming up on 93:50 in 15 seconds. You want to check the event timer? I'll give you a hack in 9 second; at 93:50. Okay.
Okay. Stand by. I'll get this.
Ready for LM Power. Stand by. Go.
on LM Power.
Oh, boy.
You want these interconnects on Gene's hose? No. You're on the Now, get this out of the ways and put an interconnect on it. Are the interconnects down in the bag, there?
Okay. You? You want to roll to 3 - 3 fif - 315. What'd you do John?
Okay, here's the, John. You can put that on that. Right here.
Okay, Gene-o's hose for interconnection.
Where do you want to put these, John? You can stick that You need one more connection, for Gene-o (cough).
315. Yes. Hey, you stopped at 330. I'll give you one more chance, babe. OK, let us know roll the? I think we're configured, babe. I'll get out this activation. Yes, we're running a good 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Huh? OK, well we'll try to stay way ahead of schedule, and that'll give you time, huh?
Oh, shit. Boy, this quad A did get hotter than a son of a bitch. 400; B is 375; C is 350 - 350 - psi - No, wait; the psi is right up there around 5,000. It's up there around 5,000, I know.
Oh, shit. It's over 400 degrees. No wonder they. I wonder if made.
What - what'd you say, Gene-o? What? OK, coming up on 93:56. I'll give you one at 93:57; OK? You've got 20 seconds to go.
4 seconds - 93:57. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

10 seconds. 4, 3, 2, 1...
Mark it.
4 - 3, 4, 5, 6. Fixed? Okay? You've got LM power all squared away yet, babe? Get into the LM (cough), José. AOS, babe. AOS. I'm going to disconnect these LM power cables, Gene-o. Okay? Get it AOS. Okay, LM power is coming disconnected.
Okay. Yes. Didn't you hear me? You did? Huh? Which one do I...
Oh, okay. I see what the problem - Excuse me.
Okay, let's get these stowed; these are good souvenirs.
Okay. Put those up, huh?
That's both of them, babe.
I'll put them in the temporary stowage bag. That's a safe place.
Yes, that's fine.
OK. Just keep busting on ahead, babe. Shit. I'm getting this thing cleaned up up here.
John?
Yes?
You got a wet rag, babe? And I'll clean up this deal on the LM, in case...
I know I saw me a wet rag down there somewhere, but I sure haven't got one, I tell you.
I have one in my - (Cough)...
I'm just freaking helpless.
You got your suit on?
Are we supposed to reverse suit hoses here, to get cooler? Yes.
Yes.
Oh, where did you put our - I've got a towel in my - trouser pocket of a...
Well, let's go.
That's the TV camera you're banging all over the place.
Well, shit. What a mess!
(Cough) It is pretty bad, isn't it?
Guarantee it is. I put them down in there. Remember?
Where?
My.
Yes. Where, John?
Back in hack, there.
In the?
Yes.
Get through?
I think done.
Good shape.
hard to beat, John.
That's right. You get the through a.
You know it.
You want to put that stuff back there?
Yes,.
Okay. How much? Alright. Put these things up here..
Okay. I think you've got to go up to the...
What the hell is that?
That's Gene-o's S-band,
Wow; poor Gene-o. That's all I get to say.
Shit. I don't know if there is a way we can get that thing good and clean. I wiped it off.
Got a lot of Mylar down in here.
OK, I'll get up there. I'll just take this thing in with me.
Say; you have my gloves, babe.
Yes. Thank you.
Check and make sure your two gloves are mates.
Yes. How about you, babe?
OK. I thought maybe.
pick the whole if you want to..
Hey, Gene-o. How about knocking my helmet bag down here to ECS? It might my hoses, the whole thing right there..
you, too. How's; that quad?
your temperatures.
Temperature is over 400. Look at the pressure in the other one.
damn fool there..
See, D is up; A, B, C, D. About 400 degrees.
Had a barbecue there last night.
Why the freak didn't they say something about it last night? That's stupid.
Maybe they'll cool down now.
I don't know if they will or not. A is right there.
Yes, if you stay 180 degrees or more away.
Babe, that ain't why it got hot.
Flipped quads A and B and didn't flip quad A.
C and D quads?
That's what you're worried about.
Come on, Tom.
little while yet. It's still on there.
Hang on, Tom. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, Tom.
What's the matter, babe?
You've got my.
Oh. You want some chewing gum, John?
No thanks.
Huh? You don't?
No. OK.
I'll put two or three water bags in this temporary stowage bag.
OK, you can go ahead and go into the LM and activate the ECS, if you want to.
I've got to wait.
For what?
Well...
What do I do to turn it off?
Okay, John. Babe is the only thing you have to do...
Yes.
the LM stuff and...
Yes?
and the TV.
Okay.
The monitor will come on for you,.
That's alright. That's just the way it was. That's fine.
Okay. Some.
Okay.
That's all you got, to do. And, you've got it on the wide zoomer?
Yes.
Okay. So there's a big field of view in the little glass here. Are you focused with your zoom?
Why don't we take the top - why don't we take the thing off and run a little? Get the monitor adjusted.
see it operate..
Yes.
TV? to use just the.
What you looking at?
Looking at the window. I'm looking at the Earth.
Looking at the window, or my head? My head bothering you?
No that's great.
What is?
Looking at the window of the LM.
Okay.
Good picture.
Beautiful.
Okay, TV off. How'd it come out, (cough)?
I'll tell you; they put it on more than that.
Do it that way?
Yes.
Okay, they'll switch the TV.
Okay.
That thing is all set up; let me recheck your Hasselblad for you. About, you know, f:11 at 1/250. You want this slide out?
Yes.
Okay.
Okay. The only thing, as far as final details, you can the S-band, you can.
Okay..
S-band, Attitude Deadband, the spacecraft.
Could you move that to my -?
Yes.
Yes..
freaking hoses.
Yes,.
see this TV. It's sure getting dark out there.
You're not in there.
retrack other one?
No. No. That's OK.
No. No, I want to wait. Get the S-band.
I don't know.
Maybe they're down in one of these - here.
Hey. Is that any part of it, right there?
No..
I couldn't read the panel too...
No, not too good. Couldn't get - No, that's part of the suit.
Isn't that the suit in back of you, John?
Yes. That's - No. Something like that..
OK. If you want to stay ahead, you're going to have to go out to the LM.
Right now?.
Well - you'll be 30 minutes ahead if you go now. Because IVT to the LM is definitely Go...
Well, I...
activate ECS and checkout, connect with ECS, suit-fan water check, glycol pump check.
I'm coming in. What, Gene-o? Two APCs; okay.
You got? No, I've got.
Yes. Shit. You've got.
Okay, John, I am going to disconnect this. This suit, right - here.
Where?
Right at them.
Don't hang the hoses in the tunnel, because - I'm fixing to get the gear out first.
Okay, Gene, I'm coming in. Okay. I'll let you configure the...
Hold it. Wait, wait, wait. (Sneeze) Scat! Freaking thing.
If you're not too tired, coming off?
Huh? Yes.
Take it easy. See you in a couple of hours.
Okay.
Okay, you guys, we're going back to the right attitude for acquisition.
Houston, Apollo 10. Over.
Go ahead, Apollo 10. Houston.
Roger. Tom and Gene are in the LM, checking things out.
Roger. We copy.
We've gotten through the steps. We changed the canisters. We've got the LM power on. LM cables are disconnected and stowed. I and Tom are in our PGAs, and you got the roll CAL from last night.
That's affirmative. We have that.
Apollo 10, this is Houston. We'd like to have the CMC for an uplink.
Roger. Wait a second.
I read you guys loud and clear.
You have P00 and Accept, Houston.
Houston. Roger.
We just got a VHF B check and it's so much better than the simulator, Tom says you can't believe it, and I agree.
Roger, 10. Thank you.
Houston, Snoopy is giving you a call on S-band. This is Charlie Brown. Over.
Okay, Charlie. We're not reading Snoopy yet.
Are you reading them, Gene? They are reading you, there, Houston.
Snoopy, this is Houston. We are not reading you.
Hello Snoopy. This is Houston.
Houston, Snoopy is calling you and he reads you apparently.
Okay, Snoopy. Understand you are reading us. We are not reading you yet. You might try Downvoice Backup.
Oh, it's touchy comm!
He is using Downvoice Backup.
Hello, Snoopy. This is Houston. How do you read? Over.
He wants to know how you read, Gene-o. You hear him?
Charlie (Brown), this is Houston. We're not reading Snoopy.
Roger. Roger. He's changing antennas now.
Hello, Houston, Houston, this is Snoopy. How do you read? Over.
Hello there Snoopy this is Houston. Reading you now, but quite a bit of noise in the background. Over.
Okay. How do you read me now, Jack?
Okay, Snoop. I don't hear the noise now, but you're way down in the mud.
Okay. I'll try and talk louder. The noise was because I was on ICS (intercommunication system) PTT (push to talk) Downvoice Backup and you had a high Freq in here. I'll bring you up to date. You might get your activation and checkout list out and wait a second - I'll Tell you where we are.
Okay, Snoopy. We've got the - we've got...
Turn to page 20...
Tom. are you done - with ECS second?
Snoopy, this is Houston. We've got the Checklist out. Go ahead. And, be advised you are still down in the mud.
Push.
Okay. I'm yelling as loud as I can. We are on page 29. On page 29. I just finished the LGC self-test. The spacecraft is all Go; I found nothing wrong with it. Tom is in here suited. He's up through page 29. I'm ready to do the S-band TR power amplifier check, and then I will do the steerable check, and I will go out and get suited while Tom continues. Are you with me?
That's affirmative, Snoopy. We are reading you.
Okay. I'm presently on high voltage taps, and I'm ready to go S-band transmitter/receiver secondary and power amplifier secondary. Are you ready?
Stand by one. Snoopy, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Hey, John. I think I've got your helmet here.
Okay. Go ahead and I'll wait 60 seconds.
John, do I have your helmet? I don't want the cover on it. How about giving me one of those other helmets.
Hello, Houston. Houston, this is Snoopy. How do you read on Secondary? Over.
Snoopy, this is Houston. We have a lot of noise in the background; hearing you very weakly.
You're loud and clear to us.
Okay. I read you loud and clear, I'll go back to Primary at this time.
Roger; Hear you're going back to Primary.
Tom, are you checking these things off? How far along are you?
I'm squared - I'm waiting for - to get John on VHF A Simplex down there on the list.
Are you done with the suit fan check?
Oh, yes. that shit's all finished. I'm all finished, babe. I'm down to VHF A. Okay.
Go.. Coming to you. John.
Hello, Houston, this is Snoopy. I'm ready to do the S-band steerable antenna check.
Hello, Houston, this is Snoopy, I'm ready to do the S-band steerable check.
Houston, this is Charlie Brown. Snoopy is ready to do the steerable S-band antenna check. Over.
Snoopy, this is Houston.
Houston, Charlie Brown. Over.
Snoopy, this is Houston. Request you try turning your ranging switch Off. Over.
They want you to try turning your ranging switch Off, Gene-o.
Okay, Houston. This is Snoopy with the ranging switch Off. How do you read?
Okay. Gene, We're still hearing you very weakly, and a lot of background noise, over.
I don't doubt about the background noise. We got it in here, but I can't do anything except eat these mikes from here on out
Houston, this is Snoopy. I'm ready to go with the steerable test, if you're ready.
Hello, Snoopy. This is Houston. Go ahead with the steerable check. Over.
Okay. Hey, John, are you in the attitude as prescribed?
Yes. Just about.
Okay.
Charlie (Brown), this is Houston. We're still reading Snoopy very weakly with a lot of background noise. You may have to relay some.
Roger.
Okay, Snoopy. We're at the attitude.
Okay. And I should have good high gain lock. Hello, Houston, this is Snoopy. How do you read on high gain?
Oh, that's much better now, Snoop.
Okay. I don't know if that's any sign. That was a piece of cake. I hope it works that way.
You're coming in loud and clear now, Snoopy.
Okay, Jack. things are going, so far, real well up in here. I'm about ready to go off the loop here, go back and get suited up, and we'd like to stay ahead of the game if we can. All my voltages look real good. Just to bring you up to date: I'm, reading 30.2 on the commander's bus and 30.2 on the systems engineer's bus. Inverter number 2 is in the high side of the Green. Battery number 6 is reading 37 and battery number 5 is reading 37.
Roger. We copy, Gene.
And our glycol temperature started out at about 70 or 75 and it's come down very slowly, and is now within the green band. I guess it's about 50 - 48 degrees right now. Our SHe pressure looks good, within the nominal limits; and our ambient pressure looks good; and our ascent helium pressures look good, also.
Roger, Snoopy. We copy.
Okay. Jack, the next time I see you, I'll be dressed for the occasion.
Roger. We'll be looking forward to it, and we'd also like to keep ahead a little bit.
And, Charlie (Brown)...
That's okay, babe. I'm going back to suit up.
Roger, Gene. And, Charlie Brown, we have a Landing Site 2 track pad when you're ready.
Roger. Landing Site 2 track PAD, Go.
Roger. 096:47:24, 096:52:24; 000, 270, 000, north 11 19 21 - what's this? - and your site is 130.
Roger. 096:47:24, 096:52:24; roll, 0; pitch, 270; yaw, 0; north 11 miles.
Roger, Snoopy. And we've got a 1921 and a 130.
Yes. Bet you.
Hello, Charlie Brown. Snoop would like to do a VHF A Simplex check now.
Roger. Going VHF A Simplex.
Roger, John.
Snoopy, Charlie Brown. How do you read?
Roger, Charlie Brown. This is Snoopy. I'm reading you loud and clear. How me?
Okay.
Snoopy, Charlie Brown. How do you read? Over.
Roger. John, you're really blasting me out. I'm reading you loud and clear.
How do you read me, John?
Snoopy, Charlie Brown. Do you read?
Roger. I'm reading you loud and clear, John.
Charlie (Brown), this is Houston. Snoopy is reading you. Over.
Roger, I know it. I read him loud and clear on Bravo.
Hello, Charlie Brown. Snoopy. How do you read on Simplex A?
Tom, I can hear you, but just barely. I've got the squelch turned all the way off.
Okay. You're coming through loud and clear. I'll tell you what, I'll increase the squelch here a little bit.
How do you read now, John?
I can hear you talking in the background, but I don't understand anything you're saying. Let me switch antennas.
Okay.
Snoopy, Charlie Brown. Over.
Roger John you're coming through and loud and clear.
I don't hear you, Tom.
Okay.
Hey, can we go back to VHF B?
Let's go back to B Simplex.
Hello...
Houston, this is Charlie Brown. Do you have any suggestions?
Stand by one, Charlie.
Charlie Brown, Snoop. How do you read on VHF B? Can you read me on VHF B?
I read you loud and clear, Tom.
Let's stay here.
Okay.
Can we try Duplex B? Over.
Stand by.
Go ahead on Duplex B.
Snoopy, Charlie Brown. How do you read? Over.
Roger. Loud and clear, John, really loud and clear.
I can't hear you on Duplex B, Tom.
Okay. Let's go to B Simplex and stay there awhile, John.
Charlie (Brown), this is Houston. Snoopy wants to go to B Simplex. He's reading you; you're not reading him.
Roger. I read you loud and clear on B Simplex, Tom.
Roger. I'm reading you loud and clear on B Simplex, too, John. Let's just stay here.
Houston, Charlie Brown. Can you work this problem, please?
We're working on it, Charlie (Brown).
Charlie, this is Houston. We're finished with your computer. You can go to Block.
Roger.
Okay, Charlie Brown. Snoopy. You want to give me a time hack on Verb 16 Noun 65? Or your mission time. It doesn't matter.
Okay, Snoopy. Time hack follows: 94:53:17, 18, 19, 20.
Okay. We're in good shape, here, until we get an update. It looks good. Let's go, and give me Verb 05 Noun 01 1706, Enter. See if that's changed and give me the numbers, babe.
Roger. Verb 05 Noun 01: three balls 12, 13256, 332, 66.
Okay. Got it. thank you.
Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy. Over.
Go ahead, Snoop. Houston standing by.
Okay. If you have high gain lock, I'm ready for my E-memory dump on page 33.
Snoopy, this is Houston. Put your update link to Data, and we are ready for the E-memory dump. Over.
Okay.
Updata link to Data and E-memory dump coming at you.
Mark.
Roger, Snoop. We copy.
Hello, Charlie Brown. Snoopy here.
Go ahead, Gene. This is John.
Okay, José. How are you doing? I'm ready to do that docked alignment - the docked alignment if you are. How are you doing there?
Okay. I'm about ready.
Okay, John. When you get all squared away, we go in the minimum deadband attitude hold, hold the rascal tight; and then on your mark if you can give me Verb 06 Noun 20, and then just hold it until I get my alignment squared away.
Okay. I'm going to SCS and then deadband.
Okay. We're in Min deadband.
Okay. If you're in Min deadband attitude hold and when it all settles down there, give me Verb 06 Noun 20, and we'll have at it. Over.
Roger. Verb 06 Noun 20: it's 13807 20094 00055.
Okay. Reading them back: number 1, 13807; number 2, 20094; number 3, 00055. Over.
That is correct.
Okay. Hold it there and we will be at it.
Charlie Brown, this is Houston. We have your DAP update PAD when you're ready.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. John - John, you can go ahead and release it, the minimum deadband. We're all out on the course align and we're squared away.
Okay. Go back to CMC in Auto.
Okay. And real fast here: if you can give me a Verb 06 Noun 20, we'll mark it forward and call the ground on a fine align.
Let me know and I'll give the Enter on Verb 06 Noun 20. Are you ready?
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. 3, 2, 1.
Mark it.
You got it.
Okay. Read it to me babe.
Let's do another one, Tom. I was a little late on that one.
Okay. Just a couple of seconds. Okay. Counting you down: 4, 3, 2, 1.
Mark it.
Okay. Plus 13801, plus 20067, plus 00048.
Okay. Was the first one 138?
Right. Plus 138.
03801, plus 20067, plus 00048.
Right.
Okay.
Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy.
Go ahead, Snoopy.
Roger. Did you read out that John's Verb 06 Noun 20?
That's affirmative. We copied: 13801, plus 20067, plus 00048.
Okay. And here are my gimbal angles: plus 16070, plus 02023, plus 35973. Over.
Okay, Snoop. We got you: plus 16070, plus 02023,plus 30 - correction - plus 35973.
That is correct and we're still running about 35 to 45 minutes ahead of time. Over.
Snoopy, this is Houston. We would like you to check your T-ephemeris. We think it's incorrect.
Okay. I'll recheck it. Thank you.
Okay. I got three balls 12, 13256, and 33266 - here, Tom.
And that's exactly what I've monitored. If you read my DSKY, I've got it three balls 12, 13256, 33266. Over.
Instant sunset.
Roger, Charlie (Brown).
Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy. I'm going to jump way ahead and get my rate gyro check out of the way.
Roger, Snoop. We copy.
Charlie Brown, this is Houston. We're going to have to do a P52 and then repeat step 7 on your activation 35.
Okay. You've got to have a P52 first, huh?
That's affirmative.
Hey, C.B. (Charlie Brown)?
You want to get this thing out of the way? You want to get this out of the way first?
I got to do a P52 right now, babe.
Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy. I'm standing up here in the hatch. Do you want us to do a P52 right now or do you want us to start working on the hatch to get that out of the way? Over.
Snoopy, we want you to get the P52 in before we go LOS, which is going to be in 33 minutes.
Yes. We'll both check this bear up here, John.
Hello Houston, Houston. This is the LMP back in Snoopy.
Roger. We read you loud and clear, Gene-o.
Okay, Jack. I'm getting on my hoses here and I'll be with you in a second.
Is that the way it's supposed to be?
I think that's right. You got your?
I'm sorry. It looks good to me.
I'm sorry. Gene-o.
I'm sorry. Turn the...in and lock.
Are you done up there?
No.
Huh?
No. I got up to the...
Charlie (Brown), this is Houston. Let's take an option 1 on that.
Go ahead.
Keep that on.
Who are you talking to?
John. I got the docked alignment in but they wanted a P52 in.
Did you look at that hatch real good babe?
I'm not ready to close it yet.
No, but did you look at the seal real good?
Yes. I wiped it off with a rag, and I'm going to rewipe it.
Okay, Tom, how far are you - did you - do you are you still on Omnis or something?
Oh, yes. We still have 30 minutes left for contact with them.
Oh, okay. We're right here then, huh?
Yes, I've already gone - I've got the E-memory up out of the way, and I've gone ahead and got the rate-gyro check out of the way. All that stuff is done now.
TEphem - this is all done?
Yes. Keep going. I got all that stuff done. All this is done. All that.
You got the alignment stuff in, too?
Yes. It's done.
How far did you go down here?
I got that done but they said we have to do it again since he didn't have a fine align. Okay, so we'll have to make another one.
Aha! Today it picks up the LM.
What did he say?
Today it picks up the LM.
What picks up the LM?
Do we have any tape? Something to wedge.
No, not in here.
They told those people to leave that out?
Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy. I'm going to go ahead with the ascent battery activation and checkout at this time. Over.
Roger. We copy, Snoop.
I'm going to turn the suit flow off and try to get these hooked up a little better.
That's the ECS probably, where you got it.
I just want the ascent batteries, Tom.
Houston, bus voltage on ascent battery alone looks like it's about 30 volts apiece.
Roger. We copy, Snoop.
I itch.
Houston, you got those gyro torquing angles? Over.
We're copying them down. Stand by.
Okay, Charlie (Brown). We've got them.
Tom.
What?
Tom.
What?
Are you going to copy something down? Go ahead.
What do you need?
I want you to take this - see this chain? Just push it way down under my underwear. Just push it way down.
Okay, Charlie (Brown) and Snoopy. We've got some switches for you to check on the VHF-A comm situation.
Way down. Just push it down. Okay? Okay.
For Snoopy.
Roger. Go ahead.
It's down there now. I just wanted to make sure just push down under that underwear. Okay.
Okay. For Charlie Brown: this is VHF/AM A Simplex basic check. Your VHF/AM A switch in Simplex, VHF/AM B in Off. VHF/AM receive only in Off, VHF ranging Off. And for Snoopy: VHF transmitter A to Voice, VHF receiver A to On, and on the commander's audio center your VHF A transmit/receive to TR.
Okay. For Snoopy, that was VHF A transmit voice receiver On, and what was the last one?
VHF receiver A to On, and on the commander's audio side, the VHF A TR to TR, and check all circuit breakers In.
Tom, you got - commander, are you on T/R?
Yes, A. T/R, B is Receive.
Roger. That was the setup I had there, Jack.
Roger. Thank you, John.
OK we got them. Hello, Charlie Brown. Snoopy. How do you read on A Simplex?
I read you same as before, Tom, which is unreadable.
Well, you try him.
John, do you read me any better?
Negative. I can hear you through the tunnel.
We've got problems.
Okay. But you don't hear me any better, huh? Okay.
Tom. check all your circuit breakers over there, Tom.
I've got them In. I've got them In.
OK, Snoopy and Charlie Brown, this is Houston. We're ready for you to do step 7 on your coarse align procedure.
Okay, John. How do you read now?
Wait a minute. Let me...
We can't freak around...
Okay. We're going to have to go back to - Okay, go ahead, Tom.
Okay, John...
Are you on Duplex B, Tom?
Verb 06, Noun.
Simplex A?
and I'll count you down. Okay?
Can he read you, I wonder?
No.
Hey, Tom, are you on Simplex A or B?
John, let's don't screw with them. Let's go on to B, and we'll get this stuff out of the way.
Go Simplex B, tell him.
Simplex B, babe.
Charlie, this is Houston. He wants to go to Simplex B.
Okay. How do you read. now?
John, I'm reading you loud and clear. How do you read me? Over.
Now, I don't read you.
Ah, shit!
John, do you read me on Simplex B?
Yes. Loud and clear.
Okay, put your VHF...
Got it. Got it. Hey, John. We got it now. Let's go ahead with Verb 06, Noun 20, and tell me when you're ready, and I'll count you down. Over.
Okay. Go.
Okay. 3, 2, 1.
Mark.
Okay. Plus 13552, plus 19371, plus 00132.
Okay. I've got all those. Plus 13552, plus 19371, plus 00132. Over.
Check.
Okay, Houston. This is Snoopy. Ready to copy my angles? Over.
Go ahead, Snoop.
Okay. My angles at 06 20: plus 012. Pardon me, my first... plus 16354, plus 01299, plus 35901, and I assume that you copy, John. Oh, pardon, that's 35906 on the last register.
06, 06, Tom.
Oh, pardon us, 35906 on the last register.
Why don't you have them read them back?
He'll read them back. He should be able to read that.
Okay, Snoopy. We copy, John. Then on yours we got plus 16354, plus 01299, plus 35906.
That's correct. Thank you.
And, Houston, this is Snoopy. The ascent batteries look good. The backup and normal feed is good. And my ED voltage is 37 on A and 37 on B.
Roger. We copy. 37 on ED's.
Okay. We're ready for the probe and drogue.
Yes.
Charlie Brown, Snoopy. Our next step here - We got to have the hatch closed, so I'll stand by to help you with the probe and drogue when you're ready, babe.
Roger.
Here come the probe. Push there a little more. Okay. You got all three latches, John. No, they came out. They keep - they keep coming out. Now, it looks like you got them.
Houston, this is Snoopy. How about giving me the next LOS and the next AOS time, please?
OK, Snoopy. Your next LOS will be at 95:40, and your next AOS will be at 96 27. And I have some LM gyro torque angles for you.
Stand by half a second.
Go ahead with your LM gyro torque angles.
OK. LM gyro torque: X, minus 00730; Y minus 00700; Z, plus 00570.
OK. I got X, minus 00730; Y, minus 00700; and Z is plus 00570. Is that correct?
That's affirmative. You've got them right. There's one more thing we can try an our VHF situation. We may have the corona built up on our VHF A transmitter, so VHF A transmitter switch OFF for several seconds and then back to Voice. Over.
I don't think that will work Jack. When we just tried it again, it had been in the Off position. I put it to Voice. We'll give it a try here in minute, though.
Roger.
I was suiting up while this comm problem started. Is it a VHF A Simplex mode?
Yes.
That's affirmative. Unable to transmit Snoopy to Charlie Brown on VHF A.
Okay. That sort of blows the ranging capability doesn't it?
That's affirmative.
That hatch good and clean, babe?
Yes. I've been cleaning it.
Yes.
Houston, this is Snoopy. While they're closing off the probe and drogue and hatch, I'll copy some of those updates, burn update times, if you got them.
Okay, John. Those latches are holding good.
Roger. Stand by one, please.
Okay, Snoopy. We have these burn times. They're nominal burn times; they'll change a little bit either way. Separation is 98:47:16. DOI, 099:46:02. Phasing, 100:58...
Wait a minute, Jack. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I can only copy them down one at a time. I want to copy them right in the book. Now go on with DOI.
Roger. 099:46:02. Over.
OK. Go on with phasing.
phasing is at 100:58:25.
OK. Insertion.
Insertion is at 102:54:37.
And, Charlie Brown, this is Houston...
OK, and, I guess that's all we need right now, huh?
Charlie Brown, this is Houston. Your roll jets to Disable, please.
All roll jets - wait - wait a minute. We'll - OK, we'll disable the roll jets. Did we maneuver to the landmark tracking attitude with just the probe holding?
We haven't released the capture latches yet, Jack.
Roger. Stand by.
Looks like we're in pretty good shape ahead of time.
So far.
I'll get those things torqued in.
I got those numbers for you. I'll wait and let you do it.
Yes, just - no hurry on it.
What is he doing?
He's working around up there doing something. I don't know what.
Just as long as it works, about 10 hours.
Houston, this is Charlie Brown. Over.
Go ahead, Charlie.
Roger, What's the answer to that one?
Okay. The answer to it is that, as soon as the tunnel is vented, you can use your roll jets. Over.
Roger. Why don't we just maneuver to the attitude first then, and then preload the probe, then release the latches.
Be fine. While he's getting - Why don't we go ahead and torque this in?
Charlie (Brown), this is Houston. Stand by one on rolling to the landmark track attitude. We'd like to update the LGC clock. Over. And we'll give you a GO when you can maneuver to the attitude.
Roger. Roger. I'll go in there - I'll go in there and release the latches then.
Well, we better get our helmets on right.
He's going to release the latches. Yes, wait a minute. Tell him that.
Hey, John. Hold up. We'll get our helmets and gloves on here, and you can release them then.
Snoopy, Houston. We'd like you to put your Updata Link switch to Data, please.
Okay. It is in Data.
Hey, Gene, you guys want to put your helmets and gloves on and release these latches?
Yes. I'll give you a call when we get them on, John, before you release them.
How does that look back there, Tom?
What?
My helmet.
Oh, yes. It's tilted too much. Just a minute. Oh - no - Let me - got it.
Squeeze it down around the back. Is that squeezed?
Yes. This freaking Velcro in this - both of these machines is horrible!
The Velcro is - is miserable.
And this ECS system isn't much better than what we squawked at in the altitude chamber. Soon as I start puffing I start breathing those - Gene-o, you want to give me one quick - push here?
You're not in a - in that Receive position...
Ah, shit I always try to leave it. Here we go. Go.
Okay, Charlie Brown. We've got helmets and gloves on. You can open the latches.
Okay. I've got the Cabin Gas Return to Egress...
Don't we want to close that thing, Tom?
Yes. Tell him I'm going to close the hatch now.
Charlie Brown, this is Snoop. Do you read?
Roger. Just a second.
Okay. And we're closing our hatch at this time.
That's about as clean as you can get it.
Push up on it. There you go.
Is that it?
That's it, babe.
Sure went in easy.
When this goes to Auto, let's make sure that we pull that thing down, after our check.
Make sure what?
When we go to Auto on that...
Okay. And I'll disable the roll jets here.
Tom, put these up there where they belong now.
Yes. I'll put my bag over on the - You want to take your bag out of the way?
Yes.
I guess we should really go to Auto here.
Snoopy/Charlie Brown. This is Houston. Our uplink is complete, and you have a Go for a maneuver to the landmark tracking attitude, and we have to have the OPS source pressure. Over.
Wait a minute. Let's see what it...
We've got to go to Auto. We don't...
Wait, wait. Let's...
Let's see what it says here.
When he vents the tunnel, he's going to suck us down.
Stand by one. Overhead Dump valve to Auto, Tom.
Sure. Yes. Got to put that latch in there.
Pressure Regulator A and B, Cabin.
Okay. Cabin.
Suit Gas Diverter valve, Push, Cabin.
Push, Cabin. Okay, there's Cabin, Cabin - got an eye on Cabin...
Yes, I think - pull...
There. Okay. I've got the Cabin Gas Return, see, in case that thing blew out - that was open into our suit loop - the Cabin Gas Return. So we're okay. Cabin, Cabin, everything is sealed up. Cabin Gas Return is Auto and Suit Circuit Relief is Auto.
Okay, Houston. This is Snoop. I read 5800 on both OPS's this morning when I came in.
Roger, Snoop. We copy. 5800.
Tom, will these things snap back there? They will. They ought to be snapped.
What's that?
I'll try and do it.
Do we have those gyro torquing angles?
Yes.
Right here, Tom.
Okay, wait a minute.
Let me snap these things down out of the way.
Snoopy, this is Houston. We are 1 minute from LOS. I recommend you lock your high gain antenna. Over.
Roger. thank you.
Did you get those numbers, Tom?
00730, right?
They can take the Velcro that's on these spacecraft and - I don't know what the hell they can do with them, but they can give it back. Ain't worth a damn.
Charlie Brown, this is Houston. We notice an increase in your O2 flow. Recommend two return valves Closed with your helmets and gloves off. Over.
Does the suit circuit flow hot and cold?
Yes. These god-dang things - we got to snap them after we get the helmets and gloves off. This Velcro is about as useless as a - god-dang!
It's all set. You want to - Okay. Is that a 3 or a 5?
Minus 00730.
Okay, I got the rest of them.
Minus 00700 and plus 00570.
OK.
Charlie Brown, this is Snoop. How are you doing?
Roger. I've got them all unlatched and I'm visually inspecting them to make sure that they're all back.
Okay, give us a call when you get ready to - you know, vent that tunnel down there, and we'll watch our pressure.
Roger.
Okay, they're all released, Gene; and they look good. They're all well back from the.
OK.
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
Yes.
Okay, Snoopy, the hatch is installed. I'm ready to vent the tunnel. Over.
Okay, we're watching it. Go ahead, John.
Okay, you guys, give me a second or 2 to get a... out of here.
OK.
Shit!
Okay, going to Vent.
OK. Go slow.
Okay, have you got your Dump valve in Auto? Over.
That's affirmative. It's in Auto.
Roger. I went to - I've been to Tunnel Vent, and nothing's happening.
We're holding pressure here.
Roger. You understand my LM/Command Module Delta-P gauge is changing?
Yes, what about - Isn't there a Tunnel Delta-P position on that?
Yes, there is. If this is what it takes, it's going to take a month to get it out this way.
Yes, it's supposed to take quite a while.
Yes. I hope we're having the same pressure as you are. We don't want that one to decrease.
I remember Dave Scott said it takes quite a while.
Yes, but we ain't got quite a while.
Yes. Look if there's any problem - hell, go ahead and maneuver, John.
Alright.
Yes.
