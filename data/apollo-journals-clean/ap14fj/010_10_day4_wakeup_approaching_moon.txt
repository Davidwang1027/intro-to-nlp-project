Apollo 14. Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 14. Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 14. Good morning. How do you read me?
Roger. Good evening, Apollo 14. Loud and clear.
Good morning, Bruce. Do you have a consumables update for me?
Roger. Are you ready for it?
Okay. Any time you're ready to give it.
Okay. Consumables update...
Good morning.
GET of 75 plus 33. RCS total, 83 percent; quads, in order, 83, 83, 82, 84 percent; hydrogen, 72.4, 72.8; oxygen, 89, 87, and 38.
Houston, 14. Do you read me?
Roger, 14. Reading you loud and clear now. We had another antenna switch. Over.
Roger. I lost you after the first hydrogen tank.
Okay. Hydrogen tank 1, 72.4, 72.8; oxygen, 89, 87, 38. Over.
Roger. I got your
Say again your last, Ed.
Roger. I only got the first oxygen tank. Try me again on 2 and 3.
Okay. Tank 2, 87 percent; tank 3, 38 percent. Over.
Roger. I got 75:33; RCS total, 83; quads are 83, 83, 82, 84; hydrogen, 72.4 and 72.8; oxygen, 89, 87, 38.
Roger. Are you all eating breakfast up there now?
Our - We're starting. The cooks are in the kitchen at the moment. Our radiation readings for last night - or rather for this morning are 16045 for Al, 1042 - 01042 for Stu, and 05038 for Ed.
Roger. 16045 for Al, 01042 for Stu, 05038 for Ed, and how about quantity of sleep? Do you have any comments on that? Over.
Roger. For Al, 6 hours; Stu, 6-1/2; and for Ed, 6-1/2.
Roger, Ed. And Ed, when you - when you all feel prepared, we've got quite an extensive batch of paperwork to pass up to you here.
Okay, Bruce. Stand by 1.
Roger.
Is it all going to be associated with the Flight Plan?
Well, let's see. We got - we got a comment on the Tephem. We've got a flight-plan update. We've got a docking probe status report. We've got a pericynthion plus 2 abort pad. We will have an LOI abort chart in numbers - criterion update. We'll have some questions for you on the cosmic ray flashes. And when it comes in, we'll have a procedure for you for checking out the ascent stage battery number 5 in the LM. Over.
Also the sports news and commentary on midcourse 4.
Okay. Why don't we get the Flight Plan first, so that we can kind of see where we're going. And then we'll string the others out throughout and after breakfast.
Okay. Actually, I think you were looking over my shoulder, because the flight-plan update is about the simplest of the whole bunch. What we're aiming towards here...
We are looking over your shoulder.
(Laughter) What we're aiming towards here is getting you into the LM shortly after midcourse correction 4 - to do a little more systems detective work on ascent battery 5. Make everybody feel a little warmer down here. And, of course, the rest of the LM is still in 4 0 shape. At 76 hours in the Flight Plan, we'd like you to pressurize the LM as required. Over.
Okay. 76 hours, pressurize the LM as required.
Roger. At 77 hours, plus 45 minutes, which is right after midcourse 4, maneuver to Moon-view attitude. And that attitude is presently contained in the Flight Plan at 78 plus 55 and is roll 352, 110, 311. Over.
Roger. Maneuver to Moon-view attitude, and say again the angles. I understand that's at 77:45, right after midcourse 4.
Roger. Angles are 352, 110, 311, and they're currently in the Flight Plan at 78 plus 55.
You still there, Ed?
That's affirmative. Okay, I have moved it from 78:55 to 77:45.
Roger. And this is a good attitude for LM communication on Aft Omni. And the procedure that we'll have for you later on will have the S-band up for telemetry but not for voice, so you want to use Aft Omni? At 78 hours, or from 78 hours to 80 hours even, we have blocked out for LM checkout of the ascent batteries so you can plan on IVT to the LM at about 78 hours and be back out by 80. Over.
Okay. Understand that the attitude we're going to is good for the LM Aft Omni, and we will IVT to the LM at 78 hours for a battery-5 checkout and be back - plan to be hack by 80 hours.
Roger. And meanwhile, back in the Command Module, Stu can press on with the rest of the normal Command Module activities, such as the P52 and all that.
Okay. You're going to have some good words on the ascent battery 5 for me, you say, in a little while.
Yes, indeed. Joe Engle was just over in the LMS here in Houston running through the thing, and it's a fairly - fairly long procedure as far as handwriting goes, but relatively straightforward, and we'll cover it for you in detail.
Okay.
Would you like a general breakdown on what we plan to do?
I'll stand by until you're ready to read it out, but maybe you can give me a summary before.
Roger.
Okay. Ready for the next item.
Okay. This is the docking probe status summary. The conclusion down here is that, on your final successful attempt, the probe's spring started to compress slightly, followed by capture latch engagement. And the dock latch went barber pole, and then the bottle fired and retraction was normal, although the time was somewhat shorter due to the continued firing of the service module RCS. The talkback operation during initial extension and final docking plus the accelerometer data, the capture latch release mode occurrence during the extensions, all indicated normal extension, capture, and retract sequence. Some consideration was given to the possibility that the RCS thrusting compressed the probe until the docking latches engaged, but this would have required more force than the RCS provides. As we mentioned yesterday, we are still Go for the mission. Over.
Okay. And I think I'd like to have you repeat that after Al and Stu get on the headsets so that I won't have to write the whole thing down. I think they'd like to hear it.
Okay. How about a pericynthion...
Go ahead, Bruce.
Okay, Ed. We're getting a lot of noise on the downlink right now. Let's stand by until after we shift antennas again.
Okay, 14. How do you read now?
Loud and clear, now, Bruce. Okay, our status at the moment - we're going to hold the probe report until Al and Stu get on the headsets. Let's press on. What's the next thing you have?
Okay. Pericynthion plus 2 abort PAD, standing by; P30.
Are you ready for the P30 pericynthion plus 2, Ed?
Okay. LOI plus 2.
Roger. Pericynthion plus 2 abort PAD. SPS/G&N, 63, 300, plus 0.90, minus 0.33; TIG, 084:35:20...
Bruce, hold it a minute.
Okay. Would you start over again now for me, please?
Wilco, Ed. This is a pericynthion plus 2 abort PAD. SPS/G&N, 63,300, plus 0.90, minus 0.33, TIG, 084:35:20.03, minus 0711.5, minus 0053.1, minus 1276.8, roll N/A, 084 pitch, yaw N/A. The rest of the pad is N/A. This is an SPS docked burn and the attitudes are based on the landing site REFSMMAT. Read back. Over.
Okay. It's pericynthion plus 2. SPS/G&N, 63,300, plus 0.90, minus 0.33, 84:35:20.03, minus 0711.5, minus 0053.1, minus 1276.8, roll N/A, pitch 084, yaw N/A, or is that 000. The rest of the pad is N/A. SPS docked, landing site REFSMMAT. Over.
Roger. I now have your midcourse-4 PAD. I - I think you're losing ground on me down here. They seem to be piling up faster than we can get them read up.
Okay. Bruce, on the angles on that one. The roll was N/A, pitch was 84, and yaw was zero. Is that correct?
Yaw was N/A. Actually, if you want the numbers, roll would be 356 and yaw would be 009. We understood there was a previous agreement that you were just going to use pitch for checking, and you would take the roll and yaw as computed by P40. Over.
Okay. All right, press on.
Okay. Let me hold off on this midcourse-4 pad a minute. I can give you just a second's worth of discussion on the thing. It's coming out to 3.8 feet per second, and this is very close to your SPS minimum impulse. It'll be 0.69 seconds of burn time compared to your guaranteed 0.50 min impulse, and when you get down to Delta-Vc the value of 2/10ths is what they want set in the counter. Over.
Okay. Understand that.
Okay. Midcourse correction number 4. SPS/G&N, 63,375, plus 0.90, minus 0.33, TIG, 077:38:13.98, minus 0001.6, minus 0002.8, plus 0002.1; roll 011, 249, 325, Noun 44 N/A, Delta-VT 0003.8, 0:01, 0000.2, sextant star 01, 173.2, 33.5, GDC Align Sirius and Rigel; 230, 170, 002, no ullage; High-Gain Antenna angles, Pitch plus 32, Yaw 290, Narrow Beam, Automatic mode. Read back. Over.
MCC-4, SPS/G&N, 63,375, plus 0.90, minus 0.33, and 077:38:13.98, minus 0001.6, minus 0002.8, plus 0002.1; plus - or rather 011, 249, 325, Noun 44 N/A, 0003.8, 0:01, 0000.2, 01, 173.2, 33.5, Sirius, Rigel at 230, 170, 002, no ullage, High Gain Antenna angles, Pitch plus 32, Yaw 290; you want it on Narrow and Auto.
14, Houston. Readback correct.
Houston, 14. How do you read now?
Okay. When you have a chance we'd like P00 and Accept Ed. And we'll uplink you the midcourse-4 target load and a new state vector. Over.
Okay, Bruce. You have P00 and Accept.
Okay, Ed. You may recall our discussion on Tephem last evening, with regard to the sign of the quantity in R3. We've had a request down here that you, on the CMC and LGC, load in the Tephem from the pad that we passed you. That is the - the quantity using all positive signs. Do you still have that handy?
Let me double check.
Roger. Those are the numbers 00006, 39223, and 16020. Is that affirmative?
Roger, that's the one.
Okay, we'll load these in after while.
Let us finish with the uplink first.
Okay, Ed. We have a - a rather detailed change to the LOI Mode I DPS abort chart and numerical data. This is found in the Flight Plan in the Contingency Checklist, and the numerical stuff is on one of your cue cards. It'd probably be easiest if you broke out the Flight Plan, say, and went through it with me.
Okay. Did you get my readback on the midcourse-4 PAD
Uh...
It sounded to me like you dropped out before I finished reading it back.
Yes. As far as - as far as I can tell, I got all of it. I recall definitely down through Sirius and Rigel, and I believe I recall your reading the High-Gain Antenna angles back, and I got - so I'll Roger for that.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, Bruce. Give me a few words on the DPS abort changes before we start giving the actual numbers.
Okay, you have a change in the DPS Delta-V available line due to a different engine model, change in the spacecraft weight, and a change in the usable propellant from the time that this curve was calculated. You have a change in the two other lines, which are the LOI plus 2-hour and LOI plus 30-minute abort Delta-V based on the change in your orbit from the nominal plan. This all backs up to the 40-minute-late lift-off. And the numerical changes are a consequence of that, also. Over.
Okay. Let's start through them slowly then and see if we can correct them.
Okay.
Over here in the DPS Delta-V available line, the left-hand intercept is at abort Delta-V of 1966 feet per second at LOI Delta-V of zero. The right-hand intercept on the vertical dashed line comes at an abort Delta-V of 2130 and the LOI Delta-V of 725. Then connect the two intercepts together with a straight line. Over.
Okay. Stand by. The first one is 1966. Let's just take them one at a time, and I'll plot them.
Roger.
And you say the - the right-hand intercept is 21 what?
Is 2130, 2130, and it falls on that vertical dashed line at 725. It separates Mode I from Mode II.
I got it.
Okay, connect them up.
14, Houston. The computer's yours.
Okay, I'm in Block. Give me the next line now.
Roger. In the LOI plus 2-hour abort Delta-V region, the left-hand intercept is at 1477 feet per second. Over.
Copy, 1477.
Roger. And the right-hand end point is at 2026 abort Delta-V, and LOI Delta-V of 238. It should intercept your DPS Delta-V available line where it crosses the boundary between the Mode I 2 hour and the Mode I 30 minutes. Over.
Roger. Took care of that, and let me draw that one.
Okay. You ready for the next one?
Okay. Ready for the next one.
Okay. Over in the LOI plus 30-minute abort region, the left-hand intercept, with the boundary between Mode I 2 hour and Mode I 30 minutes, occurs at abort Delta-V of 1517 and LOI Delta-V of 238. Over.
And we're going down in the mud again, Ed. I'm going to wait for the antenna changeover before we continue with that one.
Okay. I've got you at 1517 for the first one.
Okay, 14, Houston. We're coming back in now. I confirm 1517 for the left-hand edge, and the righthand intercept is at abort Delta-V of 2395 on the 725 Delta-V magnitude dashed line. Over.
2375. Is that correct?
Negative. 2395. Over.
Okay. 2395.
Okay, Bruce. Have that line plotted.
Okay. And all three of those lines ought to be pretty close to parallel to the existing lines; you concur?
Yes, they sure are.
Okay. Over to the numerical data. Come on over to the - the little block there and, on the second line down under burn time starting out with 0 plus 33, Mode I, loose, it should be zero plus 33 through 1 plus 19, and Delta-VM is 238 through 570. Over.
Okay. The burn - the burn - burn time from 033 to 115 should be 033 to 119, and the corresponding Delta-VM is 238 to 570.
Roger. Next line down. The burn time is 1 plus 19 through 1 plus 40, and the burn time is - or the Delta-V M is 570 through 725. Over.
Okay. We change from 119 to 140 and Delta-VM is 570 to 725.
Roger. On the next line down, you change 1 plus 39 to 1 plus 40, so it reads 1 plus 40 through 2 plus 41. Over.
Okay. One - The next line is 140 to 241.
Okay, now down below it, you've got a column for updated times. And I'll read you the updated times.
Okay.
Okay. GET of LOI ignition: 82 plus 36 plus 47, 83 plus 06 plus 47; roll: 127, 264, 348; CSM IMU angles GET abort ignition, 84 plus 36 plus 47. The next block down under LM FDAI angles, the TIG: 84 plus 36 plus 47; 170, 261, 000.
Okay. And Bruce, the only time I think I've missed is the CSM IMU angles at LOI plus 30.
Okay. 83 plus 06 plus 47. Over.
Okay. I read back GET and LOI ignition update is 82:37:47; the LOI plus 30 is 83:06:47; CSM IMU angle for LOI plus 2 is for a time of 84:36:47; and the LM angles for that time are - the LM FDAI angles for that time are 80 - 84:36:47; and they're 170, 261, 000.
Okay, Ed. The readback is correct except that you omitted the roll, pitch, and yaw angles under CSM IMU angles for LOI plus 30.
Roger. I didn't hear them. Are they - they the same?
Okay. Roll and yaw are the same. Pitch has changed from 263 to 264. Over.
Oh, those. Okay, I thought I read them to you, Bruce. I have them: 127, 264, and 348.
Roger. Readback is correct, and we've got some news whenever you're ready.
Okay. Let's hold off and let the other guys get on the headsets and have some news, while I get some breakfast.
Okay, and those changes need to be made in the Contingency Checklist, the Flight Plan, and on your cue card.
Roger. We'll do it.
