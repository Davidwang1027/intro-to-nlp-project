BEGIN LUNAR Rev-9.
Good morning, Houston. 14 here.
Apollo 14, Apollo 14; this is Houston. Roger. Good evening, Stu.
Good evening? It's good morning, Bruce baby.
Roger. How'd you all sleep?
And Bruce, I've got a crew status report for you.
Okay. Go ahead with your crew status report.
Okay. Al: 6 hours of sleep, dosimeter, 16048; Ed: 6 hours, 01046; and 6 hours, 05038.
Okay. Understand 6 hours of sleep each, 16048, 01046, and 05038. Over.
That's affirmative.
14, this is Houston. At this time, we would like the CMP and the LMP to swap dosimeters. The LMP dosimeter is inoperative, and we would like to have two active dosimeters on the lunar surface. Over.
Okay. We'll do that.
And, 14; this is Houston. Would you confirm a negative presleep status report? Over.
That's affirmative. We went to bed all healthy, no medication, and we're getting up the same way.
Roger. Out.
Okay. When you're interested, I have about four or five general information-type items to pass up to you all.
Okay, Bruce. This is something - we should all be on the headset for? If it is, we should just wait a few minutes.
Yes. Why don't we do that? There's no great rush in any of them, but we've got 24 minutes to LOS. And just let me know when you're ready.
Okay. I'll take a consumables update, anytime you've got it. We'll get that out of the way, if you want to give it to me now.
Okay, I'll have the consumables update for you momentarily. In the meantime, we'd like you to read out the High Gain Antenna meters and the High Gain Antenna knobs. It has not been switching to Narrow Beam at AOS. We're not sure why, right now. We'd like to leave the configuration as is and get those readouts. Over.
Okay, Bruce, the -
Bruce, this is Ed. I got my biomed on, and I got the sensor corrected. Have the medics take a look at it while you're talking to Stu, please.
I understand you have your biomed hooked up, and the sensor is connected, and you'd like the medics to look at it.
That's affirm.
We're in Low Bit Rate right now, Ed. You'll have to hold on a minute.
Okay, Bruce, the read-outs on the Pitch meter is 50 degrees, on the Yaw meter is 270, on the knob, it's set at 35; and the - Pitch - Yaw knob is set at 275-
Okay, Stu, on pitch, is that plus or minus? Over.
Oh, sorry about that. Both are minuses.
Okay. Meter: Pitch, minus 50; Yaw, 270; knob, minus 35 and 275. Over.
That's affirmative.
Okay; coming at you with a consumables update. Over.
And let her rip.
At a GET of 99 hours even; RCS total, 74 percent; quads in order, 73, 75, 73, 75; hydrogen, 65, 65; oxygen, 85, 83, 31. Over.
Roger. Copy the GET 99 hours; RCS total, 74; quads, 73, 75, 73, 75; hydrogen, 65, 65; 0, 85, 83, 31.
Roger, out.
Houston, 14.
Go ahead, Ed.
Are you going to switch over to High Bit Rate so you can look at this? I'd like to go ahead and start suiting up.
Stand by.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. We request High Gain Antenna Servo Electronics to Secondary. Over.
Okay.... - -
Okay; going to Secondary.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. Request S-Band Normal, Transponder, Secondary. Over.
Roger. Transponder, Secondary.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read?
Loud and clear. How me?
Roger; reading you the same.
Houston, 14.
Go ahead, 14.
I'd appreciate an answer on your intentions relative to the sensor.
Okay, Ed. Relative to the sensor, we require a High Bit Rate down here in order for the surgeon to get any biomed telemetry. We're attempting to get High Bit Rate at the present time, as evidenced by our request for Secondary Electronics on the High Gain Antenna and the Secondary Transponder, We'll let you know just as soon as we can press on. Perhaps, in the meantime, you could tell us which sensor you think was giving you the problem and what you've done in the meantime to it. Over.
Okay, the lower sternum sensor was leaking, and we replaced it last evening, and it seemed to be the only one that had a chance to he in had shape.
We copy. Out.
to be the only one that looked like it might be...
Roger out. And -
Apollo 14, this is Houston. Request High Gain, Electronic - High Gain Antenna, Servo Electronics, Power, Primary; S-Band Normal, Transponder to Primary, and go to Track mode, Manual. Over.
I believe you cut him off, Edgar.
Yes. Cut him off in midsentence. Yes. We got the two things he wanted.
They need high bit rate.
Houston, 14. Do you read, now?
14. This is Houston. Roger. We're reading you about 5 by 4. Over.
Okay. I've given - given you Primary, Servo Electronics; Primary, Transponder; and what else did you want?
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. Let me - -
Roger. We want to go back to Track mode, Manual; and we'll use the positions that you have set on the Pitch and Yaw dials at the present time.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, Houston, there's Manual.
Manual...
Say again?
Okay. And reading you about 4 by 2 at the present time. Stand by.
God damn it. We have LOS? At what time?
No, I didn't eat that last night. Never got around to it. Why don't you just leave it there? Maybe I'll eat it.
Houston, 14. Do you read?
Houston. 14. Do you read?
Yes.
Roger, Ed. We're reading you. We'd like you to do a normal manual acquisition, switching back the Wide Beam and then coming on over.
Okay.
Okay. I'll start mixing up some chow. Al, what would you like first?
Houston, I have you on Auto and Narrow again, and I cannot seem to get the signal strength above about the three-quarter mark.
Roger. I'm reading you with a good bit of noise in the background, Ed.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. We request you attempt acquisition again using the normal manual procedures. Over.
Roger. Roger.
Apollo 14, Apollo 14; this is Houston. We suggest High Gain Antenna angles of Pitch, minus 25; Yaw, 280. I say it again: Pitch, minus 25; Yaw, 280. Over.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. We suggest High Gain Antenna; Pitch, minus 25; that is minus 25; Yaw, 280; Yaw, 280. Over.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you - -
Houston, Apollo 14. How do you read?
- minutes to LOS.
Roger. Loud and clear, now, Ed. We've got 4 - -
Go ahead, Bruce. You're loud and clear.
Apollo 14 - -
Go ahead.
Apollo 14, Stu. We've got 4 minutes until LOS. I have a four-step procedure for testing the lunar topo camera, if you are ready to listen and copy?
Stand by 1, Bruce.
Roger. We're standing by.
Okay, go ahead Bruce.
Okay. With respect to the Hycon, we think this may be a low-current problem. We've been able to duplicate most of your symptoms down here in Building 4 with the other model. What we'd like you to do is - step 1: disconnect all power connectors, inspect, and reconnect. Over.
Okay. This baby reads disconnect all power connectors, inspect, and reconnect. And I guess - you know, we - we do that when we put it in and out, if I understand your step right. I mean, they're all disconnected. I guess you mean just look at the pins and so forth. Amplify that just a little bit, Bruce.
That's correct. We'd just like you to inspect for bent pins, any sort of damage, cracked insulators; anything like that you can find in error. Break, break, for Ed. We are unable to verify your biomed harness at this time. We'd like you to change out biomed harness. Do not suit up, and we'll check it over at AOS, next pass. Over.
Roger. Understand. Change out the biomed harness, and do not suit up.
Roger. You can - you can suit up partially...
Be advised that - okay, understand. Be advised that the High Gain, I've tried manual procedures and about three-quarters of that signal strength I can get.
Roger. We copy on the High Gain. You can suit up partially if you want to take the risk of having to unsuit a little ways. Break, break, for Stu. Step 2: we'd like you to switch non-essential power to opposite Main DC Bus, that is, from B to A or A to B, whatever you were on last time. Step 3: reset control box film counter to zero; shutter speed to l/200th of a second; with magazine removed, visually examine the shutter-curtain slit position. If the slit is visible, it should not be more than 1 inch from the magazine guide rail. Examine sprocket area for visible tears. Step 4: install magazine Whiskey and actuate single frame. Remove magazine and verify slit is not more than 1 inch from magazine guide rail, if visible. Thirty seconds to LOS. I repeat, switch from nonessential power from Bus B to A or A to B, opposite what you had. Reset control box film counter to zero and shutter to l/200th; with magazine removed, visually examine shutter-curtain slit position; if visible, slit should not be more than 1 inch frcm magazine guide rail. Examine sprocket area for visible tears; install magazine Whiskey and actuate single frame. Remove magazine and verify slit is not more than 1 inch from magazine guide rail. We'll talk, to you on AOS next time on the results.
Was that LOS? Must have dropped them. Yes. How in the hell does Bruce think I'm going to copy that shit like that? Oh, he said, \"Well, we're 40 seconds from LOS,\" so he just starts reading, you know, just as fast as he can; and, you know, there's no way you can - -
Hycon.
Yes, this is - what we're going to do with the Hycon - They said they duplicated all the problems in the - in building 4, and it's a low-power problem, and they got all the - all the symptoms. I don't know why they want me to... - -
Let's get out the Flight Plan there.
Verify DSE tape motion; Low Bit Rate. Yes. It's moving. Okay. We verified that. Now we're in an eat period.
Well, they don't want him to do anything until the AOS, at least, which is at 100:30.
Cried the king.
Screw them, said the commander, and all the subjects began to fornicate. That was a Roosa original, 1971, at 99 hours and 47 minutes into the midnight flight of Apollo 14.
Yes, okay. Now, you - you went through the manual procedures, and you get three-quarters signal strength?
Would you - would you like some more? I got several packages here. I don't - I just don't chew gum, and I - pack rat, like in survival, you -I save everything that I don't - -
number... on the top and the bottom...
I think that'd be a good plan.
I'm sure they've got some - some rule that's mandatory for the biomeds for the EVA.
You want to bet a six-pack? I mean, I don't know, but I'm just - the way the system operates.
I don't know why Bruce was in such a hurry to do this Hycon troubleshooting, anyway. I don't knew when he thinks I'm going to do that.
Hey, Ed.... get Myrtle back...
comm carrier.
What?
I think...
Yes.
Do you have anything else you can throw away...?...
Sure that's exactly what you wanted...?
You don't have it on, do you?
Just want to make sure, you know.... TPI day, I didn't want the LMP to get nervous here. After...
It's down in the bottom of that temporary stowage bag that we rigged up for you. Leave the top part open.
Now, don't put it on top of any cameras or anything I think so; I know... It can sure get messy.
The only camera I really need is...
Yes, it goes flying off into space...
What in hell do you expect?
Yes (laughter).
I get to go around and drag all the stuff tack into the Command Module, and then... (laughter).
That's it. Just...
here. How about you mixing up the cold part, and I'll mix up the hot part. You agreeable to that?
Okay.
You know, I wish they wouldn't put that string on all that. I mean, it helps you find the stuff, but it's a bitch to - -
Yes. What do you do with all the loose pieces of string? Yes, getting back to Stu....
You know, they really - like say, like with the PDI or TEI, or something like that - you know, they take a one... and - -
Well, that - that helps with the... They - they'll take... the one PAD, and they claim that... go three PADs...
One in... two.
Seven is standard...
Seem a lot lower - 40,000 feet over the Moon than 40,000 feet in an airplane - don't you? It's like you could reach down and touch it.
I still don't know what gave us our trouble a couple of times.
Apollo 14. Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
Read you 5 square, Bruce. How me?
Roger, Stu. We're reading you with a good bit of background noise. We've got a few things to pass up to you, if you're ready to listen.
Okay. Stand by just 1.
Okay. Stand by just 1.
Okay. In the meantime, Stu, for you or Ed, we'd like you to try a normal acquisition again on the High Gain Antenna and, if that's No Go, try acquisition in Manual and Medium BEAM width. Over.
Okay. Let me get down here and give it a gc.
Okay. Let me get down here and give it a go.
Houston, how do you read 14?
Houston, how do you read Apollo 14?
Al. are you using the same roll-on cuff?
No.
Okay. Loud and clear, 14.
Okay, Bruce - -
Weil, I dried mine, Al.
Okay, Bruce; doesn't seem to be doing too good. Still can't get the lock up solid all the way. I'm in Auto and Medium now, and that's where you want it?
-- doesn't seem to be doing too good. Still can't get the lockup solid all the way.
I just wonder about - bacteria that's in there.
I'm in Auto and Medium, now, and that's where you want it?
Just - just concerned about the bacteria that's in there.
That's affirmative, 14. And we're checking out Ed's biomed.
Okay. Ed, they're checking your biomed.
Okay.
Okay.
(Sneeze)
That's what I hoped they might do.
Okay. In the meantime, an item of general interest on your orbital status. You started out somewhat high and are decaying at a slightly greater rate than predicted. However, the altitude at PDI will still be about 46,000 feet. That's 46,000 feet or 8.3 nautical miles; so your pericynthion's still good. Over.
Man, that'd be great, docking this baby at night. You know, that's a beautiful sight. Done good on that one. A little nighttime under your belt.
Okay. There's LOS; tape motion.
Great.
You're on high gain and set up in the proper angles
Okay, sounds like good planning.
That gives us more fuel than ever.
Okay. Sounds like good planning.
46,000 feet at PDI.
And, Apollo 14; Stu, map update REV 11, if you're ready.
Negative; stand by 1.
Negative. Stand by 1.
Apollo 14; Ed, this is Houston. You're Go to commence suiting up.
Roger, Roger. Thank you, Bruce.
Biomed's looking good. Apollo 14; Ed, this is Houston. Can you monitor, just for a minute, discussion on the ascent batteries.
Roger. I'm on. Go ahead.
14, Houston. Our feeling right now is that this is a single-cell problem in ascent battery number 5- If one cell were shorted out entirely and completely discharged, this would drop your terminal voltage by 1.8 volts. The expected voltage, open circuit, at activation is greater than 35-3. I say again, it's greater than 35*3. However, the open circuit voltage will not be our criterion. We will use the Delta in voltage between BATs 5 and 6 underload to evaluate battery 5. If there is more than a 1.8-volt Delta between 5 and 6 - that is, if it should turn out that you have a problem with more than one cell, then battery 5 will be No Go. Over.
Understand, Houston, that if, in subsequent checks, we have more than one cell that shows up bad, battery 5 will be No Go.
Roger.
Okay. And I'm ready for the REV 11 update, Bruce.
14, Houston. REV 11, 180 degrees, 102:03:40. Understand you don't need LOS or AOS; they're close to nominal.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. I've got a lot of noise in the background now. Did you copy the time for 180, 102:03:40? Over.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read now? Over.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Bruce.
Okay. We're reading you again, Stu. We'd like you to go with Manual and Medium BEAM width, please.
Okay.
Okay, Bruce. The antenna seemed to oscillate a little bit, there. It's steadied out now with a reasonably good signal - -
Say, that looks beautiful. That looks beautiful, Stu.
Okay - -
Stu, did you copy the time for 180-degree meridian, 102:03:40?
That's affirmative; 102:03:40.
Roger. Were you able to run through the LTC camera checkout procedures 1 through 4, or we fade out on you before you got them?
That's negative on being able to run through them. I didn't even begin to get them copied, Bruce. I guess - I need to - What time frame are you thinking of me troubleshooting that one? Is that something that we need to worry about right now?
No, we'll hold off on that.
Okay, 14. On the subject of the docking probe situation, for undocking, we anticipate a normal undocking sequence, that is, extension followed by release of the LM. If there should be no release at this time, we request that you hold the Release position of the Extend/Release switch and both vehicles thrust minus-X for 3 seconds, and then Release on the - or return the switch to center. Over.
Okay. Understand; we're anticipating a normal SEP. If we get on the end of the probe and no release, we'll both thrust minus-X for 3 seconds.
Roger. While you hold the switch in the Release position. And we've got some other procedures that we'll run through in real time, if the requirement develops, in order to accomplish an undocking. We would like to say at this time, though, that we are not considering blowing the docking ring in order to undock. Over.
Okay. That sounds reasonable.
And is Al listening?
Al is not on the headset right now, Bruce.
Okay. I wonder if you'd pass to him that when he and Ed go over into the LM, they should either carry with them a tool R, that's tool Romeo, from the Command Module, or, if he should have such a thing as a screwdriver, bit, or something like that available, why that would also suffice. Over.
Okay. I'll let him borrow a tool R, I guess, on a hand receipt, and he'll take that over with him.
Roger. Be sure and get a QC stamp on it.
21 Nancy.
(Laughter) Roger; 21 Nancy. Hey, a little more background on that - thing that we're looking for, of course, would be an item such as tool R that would enable our crewmen from the LM to depress the capture latch release button on the tip of the probe from the LM side, and tool R will fill this bill, or this other screwdriver, if it were available. Over.
Okay. We got you.
And with respect to docking, again we anticipate normal operation. However, we'd like to add to the normal procedures a LM plus-X thrust of 10 seconds, four-jet RCS, to facilitate or to give us just a little more of a warm feeling on the docking. Once again, we have some backup procedures that we can run through in real time, if these should prove necessary, and, in order to formalize this, I've got a flight-plan update for the CMP Solo Book and for the LM Timeline Book whenever you all are ready to copy these down.
Okay. Stand by here and let's get out the LM Timeline.
Roger. I'll do likewise down here. And we'll make them together.
Okay.
And since you don't have a lot going on up there right now, Stu, I wondered if you could give us P00 and Accept, and we'll send you up some uplinks We've got a state vector, a desired orientation REFSMMAT, a - and that's it.
Okay, You have P00 and Accept.
Okay, Stu. You seem to be fading out a little bit Are you close enough to the mike?
I - I'm talking right into them, Bruce. You have P00 and Accept.
Roger. Thank you. And would you return to the Narrow deadband five-tenths of a degree in the DAP, please?
Okay. Stand by 1.
That's in reference to keeping the High Gain pointed right at us here.
Okay.
Okay. I'm Narrow deadband. I'm through with the DSKY if you want to press with the uplink, and looks like we got good signal strength here.
Okay. It looks real good here, Stu, and we'll press on with the uplink. And I got my Timeline Book out and we're going to page 14.
Okay. We'll have to stand by on that LM Timeline Book for a little bit here, Bruce.
Okay.
And back on the subject of the drogue, I guess our analysis down here and all the data that we've been able to come up with indicates that you did, in fact, have a normal retraction on the last attempt. The selection of a bottle did not contribute to the capture in itself, and we've passed you the procedures here that we'd like you to run through.
Okay.
Houston, 14.
Go ahead, 14.
Okay, Bruce. I - just something that seems like back from memory in debriefing from 11 - they tried this plus-X on the IM and docking and they got some - if I remember right - some attitude excursions. Is everybody satisfied that the LM can plus-X and everything will be stable?
14, this is Houston. Roger. We recalled 11, and the biggest part of the problem there was that both vehicles were actively trying to control attitude. The procedure which we'll be passing up to you has you going into CMC Mode, Free, prior to the LM commencing its plus-X thrusting. Over.
Okay. So I guess we'll - we'll wait until we get the changes, and then we'll talk about it, if we've got any questions.
Roger.
14, Houston. I have your CMC REFSMMAT zero time update for you. There is no GET or Tephem, update required. Over.
Okay. And I'm ready to copy, Bruce.
Okay, CMC REFSMMAT zero zero time is 108 hours 53 minutes 58.00 seconds. And I'll have the TEI-19 PAD shortly. You want to go ahead and read back?
Okay, REFSMMAT zero zero time, 108 - 108:53:58.00.
Roger, readback correct. I'll be coming at you with the TEI-19 PAD in about 10 seconds.
Okay.
And if you're ready to copy on TEI-19, I'm ready.
Okay, TEI-19; let her go, Bruce.
Roger, Stu. SPS/G&N; 36583; minus 0.66, plus 0.24; TIG, 119:38:09.13; Noun 81, plus 2903.4, plus 1564.7, minus 0485.2; roll, 179, 120, 029- The rest of the PAD is NA. Ullage, four jets, 11 seconds. Remarks: this is an undocked burn. We assume circularization, but no plane change number 1. The lunar longitude that you are crossing at time of TIG is minus 175.8 west longitude. Over.
Okay, TEI-19; SPS/G&N; 36583; minus 0.66, plus 0.24; 119:38:09.13; plus 2903.4, plus 1564.7, minus 0485.2; 179, 120, 029. Ullage, four jet, 11 seconds; undocked, assumed CIRC, no plane change 1; and longitude of TIG minus 175.8.
14, this is Houston; readback correct. Out.
Roger.
And, Houston, 14.
Go ahead, Stu.
Okay, the LM/Command Module DELTA-P is 0.8.
Houston, Roger. Out.
Stu, Houston. How is your viewing attitude up there?
It's rather tremendous, Bruce. This - coming across this low - low orbit is phenomenal, and this attitude is absolutely great.
I guess that settles that one.
I tell you one thing, Bruce; you sure get the impression you're more like about a thousand feet than 45,000.
I guess the scenery is really clipping along.
Yes, and it seems so close. It looks like you can just reach out and touch it.
The recent input from FAO is that we need the Hycon camera check prior to a GET of 107 hours. That's about 6 hours from now.
Okay, prior 107. And we'll sure try to give it a go.
Roger. And whenever you're ready on the flight-plan update to the CMP Solo Book and the LM Timeline Book, why, we've got it setting down here, but there's no rush.
Okay, I can take the CMP Solo Book now, but we might as well get them both together, and it'll be a little bit here. They're getting their suits on.
Okay. Well, the details of the two are a little different.
Okay, lets get me out of the way and take the Solo Book now.
Okay, on page 52.
Okay, go ahead.
At 144 hours and 08 minutes, it presently reads, "Translate to capture latch," we want to change that to read, "Translate to contact." Over.
Okay, we'll change that "Translate to contact," and hope they're both the same, huh?
Roger, Roger. Under that, add in "Report contacts to LM;" and "CMC Mode, Free." Over.
Okay, and after contact, I'll report contact to LM and go CMC, Free.
Roger. And over there in the "Docking checklist," we want to delete the "CMC Mode, Free." It says, "Docking checklist at capture, CMC Mode, Free;" you can delete that.
Okay, I'll delete "CMC Mode, Free" under the "Docking checklist at capture."
And that's it. That wasn't so bad, was it?
No, that was pretty painless.
21 Nancy.
Roger.
14, Houston.
Go ahead, Bruce.
Yes, Stu; we just got word that your family is listening to you, and they're outside looking up at that great big Fra Mauro Moon.
Thank you.
Okay, Bruce; for their benefit - just to pinpoint us, we're approaching the terminator now and the Fra Mauro formation. And I guess of all the views you see, I think it's going to be tough to beat this - going into the terminator at this low altitude. It's - it's really something.
It sounds really spectacular. I'm sure we'd all like to be up there with you. I know I would.
Yes, I wish you could be - yes, I wish you could be, after all that hard work.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. We'd like to try the Secondary Servo Electronics on the High Gain Antenna and attempt a normal acquisition. If that is unsuccessful, we'll return to the present configuration.
All right, Bruce; go on Secondary, now.
Okay, how do you read, Bruce?
Loud and clear, Stu. Looks beautiful.
Yes. I went Secondary, and there was not a glitch in - in anything.
Are you in Auto now?
Oh, no. I am - I'm sorry. I didn't get the Auto bit.
Great.
I thought you just wanted Secondary on the Electronics.
Great. Now that you - -
You - you want Auto Mode? Is that - -
Now that you've got the Secondary Servo Electronics up, we'd like you to run through a normal acquisition procedure; over.
Oh, okay.
14, Houston.
Okay, loud and clear, Stu. It looks like it was successful. I understand - -
That's negative. I'm back in Manual and Medium. What happens when I go to Auto - the Pitch goes to about a minus 50 and the Yaw stays just about the same, but it seems like the Auto Mode wants to drive the Pitch down to about minus 50; and if I do that in - in - in Wide Beam width and then I go to Medium, Narrow, it doesn't seem to have any effect, and the signal strength drops back off.
Okay, we copy, Stu.
And I'm back Manual, Medium now.
Roger. Out.
Okay, Stu. We have your torquing angles. You're Go.
Okay, Bruce. Torqued at 101, 24, 20.
101, 24, 20.
14; Stu, this is Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Stu. Prior to commencing your maneuver here, which it looks like you're about ready to do, we'll give you an Omni antenna to select. Once you get to the new attitude, we'd like you to return to Manual, Medium BEAM width, and we'll give you Pitch and Yaw angles. Over.
All right, we're getting ready to manuever. Have you got the angles?
Okay, Stuart. Omni Bravo while maneuvering, and and the flight-plan angles of a Pitch, minus 80; and Yaw, 98* are good.
Okay, Omni Bravo during the maneuver, and flight-plan angles good when we get there. Thank you.
Roger. And with respect to the LM Timeline Book, we'll try to pass this up in real time during the tail end of the rendezvous. You might pass to Al that it essentially makes the Timeline Book agree with what we gave you in the CMP Solo Book -10 seconds or contact on the thrust X-plus at contact and then confirm docking. Confirm capture report from CSM.
Okay, Houston. We got that. And passing it up later is fine with us.
Roger. We just wanted to make sure you were aware of what we had in mind.
14, Houston. Six minutes to LOS.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. One minute to LOS.
Roger, Houston.
Okay; 14 is up - on the timeline, Houston.
Say again?
Okay, 14. Down here, we're going to turn over to the good old Gold Team, and the friendly Maroon Team will see you in a few hours.
Okay, stick around. We've got ice cream.
You'll be back for the fun, Bruce?
I will; yes, indeed.
They got those torquing angles on the ground, didn't they?
Yes. They said they got them.
They got the torquing angles, and I passed them...
Okay. One thing you haven't done, Stu, which you can get later - is your cameras are all here - You have to get that...
Yes. I - I'll get all those...
Okay. We're going right through gimbal lock on the GDC, and it's going right by. IMU's fine. Okay. CMP is removing the - tunnel hatch. CMP's removing the probe now. Okay. What was the DELTA-?, by the way, Stu? I'll Just jot it down here.
0.28. I wrote it down there.
Oh, did you? Okay. It's down again. Okay. 180 is 102:03:40. Three. That'll be 23:26. I could set it on 34.
Okay, Stu. Your timer is running - coming up to 60, which is - the zero of which will be your 180 update time. Okay. You verify tape motion?
That's verified.
Do I record the tunnel angle as plus 0.9?
All right.
I didn't get to brush my teeth this morning.
Okay, I'll crank in these. Get that GDC set up. 007.5
Can we help you?
Do you want to use the spring or you want to use the strap?
Need the spring to hold the nose down here.
Oh, I see what tool R is for, is to take those Phillips-head screws off the whole cover, I guess.
Not very tight. Yes. Go around it one. Much better (clearing throat).
Let's see - we just leave these out in the hag here, I guess.
Yes.
What is it! Okay. Plus 0.9- Very good.
Okay. Theoretically - on the overall scheme of things, 101:50 - -
Roger.... all the way on through.
No. 101:52. So you got 8 minutes.
(Cough) Okay. I think we're going to be ahead of it.
Yes. We're going to be ahead of the time line.
Boy, I sure hope those guys don't get nervous about that Bat 5.
I do, too (clearing throat). You didn't put down anything.
Well, jeez, he had a load on it the other day and the damn thing was holding up, wasn't it?
Yes, but they're - -
All right. We'll start through.
Okay. We'll put down that you're starting up at 101:46.
I'll give you a little room there, Stuart, and I'll come right over...
Going to get off - Turn your switches off before you get off comm.
Yes. I'll holler for it. Might as well stay on comm here - -
I don't know who the hell is going to do it for you.
Pardon?
I don't know who's going to do it for you, Ed. I can't get over there, and Stu's going to be getting his suit on. You better - turn them off before you leave.
Okay.
Turned the comm switches off.
You can just yell down, can't you?
I guess so.
Yes. See, otherwise - Stu'll be suiting, and -You probably can move a hell of a lot easier with that suit on - without those damn things on, too. Okay. Okay. How you doing, Stu?
Okay, Stu. Can I help you with your suit in any way?
Say again.
Any way I can help you with your suit now?
Yes, we're okay. All we've got is a switch to throw on this LM power. Okay. After the suit, next thing we've got is a switch to throw, and I can do that. That's 13 minutes from now. And the next thing after that - What's that?
Okay. We're in attitude. I'll go to Enter now. I'll align the GDC for you, while I'm here. Roll 1; Att SET, IMU.
GDC. Okay, Stu. You've got a good GDC.
Are you getting your suit on?
No.
Okay. Probe was removed. Drogue was removed.
Yes, I'm aware of all that. The High Gain is -is selected from new attitude, and Ed verified -tape motion. Okay, here's a Verb 48 here. Do we change the DAP load here? Yes, we do. Go to wide deadband, here. Okay. Let's see, we just completed the 48-49 maneuver, Stu. And, I've gone to Enter. We're sitting in P00 in attitude -I'll just go ahead and change the DAP right here from narrow to wide without getting... on it, right?
We've gone through the 49; got the 58 gainer added, so we're sitting here. We got a narrow deadband; the Flight Plan says we swing to a wide dead hand, here; going to do that right now without changing phase plane and getting any jet firing. Okay. Verb 48 Enter; Verb 21 Enter; and I'm going tc a 2 and all l's. Okay. 1111. Enter. And we're still using B/D Roll. B/D Roll is set up. We'll Pro on through. Okay, babe, you're in wide leadband.
How's our friend, the LMP, doing?
Got to go to a new REFSMMAT, Stu. Going to go to a new REFSMMAT. Have to go to a new REFSMMAT, when I get up in the LM. For me, I mean.
Yes.
Okay. Tell him, here I come. Nine reset, off. 101:54:00.
101:54:00.
Okay, 4-D, is that zero? Okay, a quick check on it. Okay, very good. We're through with that page. Except for you getting your suit on.
Yes....
(Laughter). Okay. It looks like he's still about - 4 minutes ahead. So, I'll go up 4 minutes ahead. That'll put me 102 - 2:05; now it's 2:01. Okay. Stu?
Yes.
Stu, I'm going to head on up there. Stay a little ahead of things.
Okay. Left-hand row, top switch, off.
I think that's that damned empty box that's been floating around for 3 days.
Hey, Al. Here's a piece I think came out of you. I think there's a fitting down here that came from you. I don't know if you need it or not. No. Look - Can - can you look over the edge? See it? Where do you leave it? In here? Well, it was floating out here. Where did he have it?
Okay. I thought it may have come out of the LM.
Stand by I.
Yes. Yes, just a second.
Kitty Hawk, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston; Kitty Hawk.
Go ahead, Houston; Kitty Hawk.
Okay. We're ready with some updates to you - or an uplink rather, if you can give us P00 and Accept.
Okay. You've got P00 and Accept.
And when you've got time, Stu, I've got some DAP data, and the SEP PAD's ready.
Okay. Stand by 1.
Okay, Antares. How do you read Kitty Hawk B?
Okay, Kitty Hawk. Antares' LMP reads you loud and clear.
CDR reads you loud and clear, Red.
Let's go VHF A.
Negative. Stand by 1.
Kitty Hawk, Antares. Start count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

Antares, Houston. Read you loud and clear.
Okay. Stand by.
Houston, Primary EVAP FLOW NUMBER 1, OPEN; 102:15: 45.
Okay. Copy now.
Okay, and your LM power transfer time was 101:54:02.
Roger, Ed. We got it.
And let's have a secondary S-band check.
Okay, Ed. We're reading you loud and clear on secondary S-band, and they're ready for primary.
Okay. Let's go primary.
Kitty Hawk, Houston. The computer is yours, and are you ready for the updates yet?
Okay, Fred. The computer's mine and go ahead.
Let me give you your DAP data first. Your CSM weight is plus 36l16. Your gimbal trims: pitch, minus 08l; yaw, plus 019.
Okay, The DAP data: weight 36116; minus 08l, plus 019.
Okay. That's a good readback, and if you've got the PAD book out, I'll give you your SEP PAD.
Okay - -
Houston, Antares. If you read me, I'll press on.
Roger, Ed. You're loud - loud and clear. Press on.
Okay.
And, Kitty Hawk, I understand you're ready for a SEP PAD.
That's affirmative, Fred. Let her go.
Okay. Your Noun 33 is 104:27:31.00. Pitch is 103. That's it.
Okay. Copy 104:27:31.00; and pitch, 103.
Okay. That's good read; and now, I have a P24 landmark track data for you.
Okay. I'm ready to copy.

Okay. That was good, Stu; and one more thing, a map update for REV 12.
All right, I'm ready.
Okay. The 180-degree point at 103:57:28.
Okay. 103:57:28. Map update, REV 12.
Good readback.
And one other thing, Kitty Hawk. Could you verify that the docking angle was still plus 0.9?
That's affirmative, plus 0.9.
Okay.
Houston, Antares. How do you read on the steerable antenna?
Okay, Antares. I read you loud and clear.
Okay.
Stu, I'm ready for a gimbal-angle check, here.
Okay. Want me to go Min Deadband and so forth?
Roger. Go Deadband, antenna...
Okay. I'm on Minimum Deadband, antenna... plus 00625, plus 11762,...
Okay. I've got...
And, Kitty Hawk; Houston.
- 02387.
Read R3 again, Al.
Okay. You got middle gimbal plus 02387.
That's affirmative. Go ahead, Houston, Kitty Hawk.
Okay. I guess we've got the LM back now. Antares, Houston. Just want to verify you're in Auto on the steerable.
That's affirm, Freddo. I went to Auto, and it was holding at a signal strength of 3.9 and I looked back over and we're - suddenly we're at 3, and I tried to relock, and I can't get it above 3 except on the Omni.
Roger, Ed.
If you'll give me a new set of angles, we'll try it again.
Stand by.
Okay, Antares; Houston. We'd like you to try the steerable again, and the flight-plan angles are 116 and 4l. Should be good.
Okay. Here we go again.
All right, Houston; Antares. I'm locked back up on the steerable, and that antenna's making a hell of a racket when it drives.
Roger, Ed.
And, Antares; Houston. We have good lock, now; and we'd like to verify you're in Auto. And the noise - again, we're not knowing what level you're hearing; there is quite a bit of noise with that antenna.
I understand that. It's Just surprisingly much more than I expected, and I am in Auto. And it seems to be holding at a signal, strength of about 3.9, right now.
Okay. And, Antares, whenever you get time there to copy, I've got your AGS abort constants ready.
Okay. I'd like to hold those for a minute, Freddo.
That would be fine, Ed.
Okay, Stu, we're coarse aligned; don't know if I need Att hold.
Okay.
Okay, Stu. We're ready for a snapshot on Noun 20s, whenever you are.
Okay. Standing by for your mark.
Okay. 3, 2, 1 -
Mark.
Okay, on your mark, I read plus 00687, plus 11777, plus 02366.
Okay. Give them to me again, please. I was copying time GET.
Okay. Plus 00687, plus 11777, plus 02366.
Okay. Noun 20s as follows: 00687, 11777, 02366.
That's a good readback.
Houston, Antares. I'll take the - the AGS control now.
Roger, Antares. And we copied the Noun 20s down here.
Okay, and GET was 102:42:21.
Roger. GET of 102:42:21, and here's the AGS abort constants, Ed: 224, plus 60464; 225, plus 29400; 226, plus 60480; 305, minus 01760; 662, minus 54516; 673, minus 31704.
Okay, Freddo. 224 is plus 60464; 225 is plus 29400; 226 is plus 60480; 305, minus 01760; 662, minus 54516; 673, minus 31704.
Okay, Antares. That was good readback.
And Freddo, I'm coming on with ascent battery check, if you would like to watch that.
Stand by.
Antares, Houston. You have the Go for the ascent Bat check.
Okay.
Bat 5 Normal Feed coming on, now.
Okay, I've got CMC time. You ready?
Yes. You want me to set it up on 102:47?
That'd be great.
Three seconds.
Hack 102:47. Did you get that or would you like 102:47:30?
No. I have that. Stand by for a snapshot on Noun 65, please.
Okay. I'm standing by.
Okay. Verb 06 Noun 65; 3, 2, 1 -
Mark.
Okay, on your mark, I read 102:47:28.35.
102:47:28.35. Thank you.
Roger.
Okay. You got a little old Tephem, over there somewhere I might be able to use? Either A or B, depending upon which one you like.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay, Tephem. Are you ready to copy?
Go ahead, Stu.
Okay. Four ball 6; 3522.3, 1602.0.
You cut out there during the middle of it. Would you give it to me again, please?
Okay. Four ball 6; 3522.3, 1602.0.
Okay. I have four, zero, six; 3522.3, 1602.0.
Okay. Let's verify R1. That's 00006.
That's verified. 00006.
Okay.
Houston, Antares.
Go ahead, Antares.
My battery check is complete. The ED Bat voltage are 37.0, 37.0; and it appears that BATs 5 and 6 look exactly like they did last night.
That looks great, Ed. Thirty-seven on each of the EDs, and we'll now get the work configured for -Verb 74.
Okay.
Okay, and we got the Tephem squared here. And Verb 74 is coming down.
Houston, Antares.
Go ahead, Antares.
Do you have any updates for DAP Verb 48 numbers?
Stand by on that one, Ed. I do have some LM torquing - gyro torque angles for you.
Okay. Roger.
And Al, when you get a chance, I'd like to verify the capture latches.
Okay, and Antares; Houston. I have the DAP data now, if you want to copy that.
Go ahead. Ready to copy.
Okay. LM weight, plus 34039; CSM weight, plus 36116; and your gimbal angles, as loaded in the computer, are good.
Roger.
And Antares, are you ready for the gyro torque angles, now?
Stand by.
That's over on about page 2-26, Ed.
Okay. Ready to copy.
A plus 00960, minus 00170, plus 00640.
I read back X, plus 00960; Y, minus 00170; Z, plus 00640.
Okay. That's correct, and I need a readback on the weights. I didn't get that from you.
Roger. The weight - LM weight: 34039; Command Module weight: 36l16.
Okay. That's good, Antares.
And Houston, I'm in my S-band antenna stop. I'm going to have to go to Omnis, I think.
Roger, Ed.
Houston, Antares.
Go ahead, Antares.
My S-band steerable pitch needle is sitting at 255 and will not move. The yaw seems to be working okay; however, I do not think that I'm in the stop.
Okay. We copied, Antares. Your pitch reading is 255 5 and INCO concurs that it appears down here you're not in the stop.
Okay, if you like, I took it out for safety's sake; I'll put it back on Auto Track if you'll give me the angles again.
Okay. Stand by,
Okay. Antares, the numbers are plus 121 and 40 - plus 40 on the yaw.
Good. Roger. 121 and 40.
Okay.
Houston. You're locked up on the steerable, and n$r pitch needle is still sitting at 255. I think we have a failure in it.
Roger, Ed.
Okay, Houston. This is Kitty Hawk. We're getting ready to drop the landing gear.
Okay.
Houston, this is Antares - -
Okay, Houston. The gear deployed, and we've got a gray talkback.
Roger, Antares.
And Antares, Houston. Would you verify that the comm display breaker is closed on 16?
That's verified.
Roger.
Remember, Fred, I've got one good needle and one bad needle.
Okay, that wasn't - wasn't clear. We weren't sure if you just said one... or not - Go ahead, Antares.
Okay, we're ready to press ahead with - -
Roger. Freddo.
Okay, Antares.
Houston, we're ready to press ahead with RCS PRESSURIZATION.
Go, Antares. You go.
Go ahead.
Okay, we're Go for RCS PRESS.
Hey, Al, when you get a chance, I need another verifier on the capture latches.
Okay, Houston. Pressurization looked good, and HELIUM PRESS, 2850.
Roger, Antares.
And Houston. We're standing by for RCS checkout; and Stu, we need Wide Deadband, Att hold.
Hey, Antares, we're Go for the RCS checkout.
Roger.
Okay, I'm CMC Free.
No, need Att hold, Stu; Wide Deadband and Att hold.
Okay. This your RCS checkout?
That's affirmative.
Okay. Mine says CMC Free; I'll give you SCS Wide Deadband.
Great.
It's the first part, Kitty Hawk. It's a cold fire.
Okay, Stu, you can go Free now.
Okay.
Houston, here comes the hard part, the hot fire check.
Okay, Antares. We're ready.
Kitty Hawk, Houston. We'd like Omni Alpha.
Okay. I - Is that for Kitty Hawk?
That's affirmative. We'd like Omni Alpha.
Okay.
Stu, hot fire checks are complete.
Okay.
Roger, Antares. We're showing you a low yaw rate now.
Go ahead.
Say again, Houston.
We're showing a little rates on there -
Why don't you bang the - take the -
Why don't you take the rate out before I go back to Auto, Ed.
Okay. You'll have to tell us which way, Stu. We're not showing any rate.
Okay. Touch it a little right yaw.
Okay, hit it again. Again, you got 2/lOths a second to go. Again. Again. Again, Again. Two more times.
Okay, that's good.
Okay.
Antares, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
When you can work it in here, we'd like you to go back to page 2-12 and repeat step 7, which is terminate self test.
Wilco.
Okay. We'll go through it again, Houston.
Okay, Antares. We don't need the whole self test again, just step 7. The termination step will do.
We understand.
Roger.
And Kitty Hawk, Houston. We're showing your cabin pressure up to about 57 now.
That's affirmative. I see it.
Houston, I'm ready for an uplink if you're ready to give it to me?
Okay, give us P00 and DATA, and we'll start her up.
You have it.
Roger, Ed.
Stu, you look good from this side. You ready for hatch closure?
That's affirmative. I'll be ready in just a little bit.
Okay. You want us to stand by?
No, you can go ahead and close your hatch.
Okay, proceeding.
