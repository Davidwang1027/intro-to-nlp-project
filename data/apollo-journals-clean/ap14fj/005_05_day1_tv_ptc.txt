Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, Ed. Here's what we would like to do on the probe removal - or actually the whole probe inspection shooting match. We'd like to remove the tunnel hatch, of course, and let you make a quick visual inspection there to see if there's anything that looks significantly amiss. If you see anything, we'd like to photograph it; and, in this whole sequence, we would like to have you power up the television and send a picture down, which we'll receive at - at Goldstone and record, although we still have about an hour or an hour and a half before we could be configured to receive the television back here live. Then pressing on from there, if you want to make a couple of notes on a pad, we'd like you to perform the probe removal in accordance with the decal with the following exceptions.
Better hold up a minute, Bruce.
Okay.
Houston, 14.
Go ahead, 14.
Roger. Can you give me the changes of this probe removal procedure so that I can copy it on page S2-5?
Roger. Actually we'll be looking at page S2-6 for the changes, that is, the section that applies to both TLD and LOD. Over.
Okay, I'm ready to copy.
Okay. At the top of page 2-6, the first step, "Probe umbilicals - disconnect and stow". We'd like you to verify proper connection of the umbilicals before you disconnect and stow them. And I guess you might take a look for bent pins, contacts, all sort of stuff. Down at about the sixth line down where it says "Capture latch release handle lock - rotate counterclockwise to unlock." We'd like you to verify that it is locked prior to unlocking it. You got that one?
Okay, go ahead.
Down about five lines further, you have "Capture latch release handle - pull, rotate to unlock, 180 clockwise," and we'd like you to pay particular attention to whether there is an unusually high torque required to unlock the capture latch release handle in this step. And we'd also like you to verify the absence of, or report, any damage to the pyro cover or to the capture latch release handle. And the pyro cover that we're talking about is the - it looks like an extruded metallic shell just forward of the capture latch release handle there. It's the one that bears the decals on it that say, "cocked" and "unlocked." Over.
Okay. Damage to the pyro cover and what else?
Any damage to the capture latch release handle? And then as you pull it out, we'd like to know if you notice any unusual forces required to remove the probe.
Okay. Let me read it back.
Okay, go ahead.
At top of page S2-6, "Probe umbilicals." Before we disconnect and stow, we want to verify that the "yea verilies" are properly connected.
Yea, verily.
And there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 "Capture latch release handle lock"; before rotating counterclockwise to unlock, I want to verify again that that is locked.
Roger.
And that you would like for us to pay attention to the torque required to loosen any of these items - oh, that's the capture latch release handle; and you want us to observe for any damage to the pyro cover or the capture latch release handle and to observe any obvious damage that's apparent to the capture latches or the probe end.
Roger, Ed. And we currently have the lines from Goldstone back to the building up here, so I think that we'll probably be ready to support via TV almost in real time. And for onboard photography, we're recommending use of the electric Hasselblad set on f/2.8, 1/125th of a second at 3½ feet, magazine O for Okmulgee, which is stowed in Alpha 13, and you might verify the f-stop with the spotmeter set at ASA 64, if you have the chance. Over.
Okay, Bruce. I got that, I believe. The electric Hasselblad at 2 8, 125th, 3.5, magazine O for Opinaca, it's stored A-13, and we'll check it with the spotmeter. How long will you have Goldstone coverage, Houston?
Ah, 14, this is Houston. We'll have Goldstone coverage for about another hour and a half. If that's any problem, we can reconfigure to pick up Honeysuckle. And the shutter speed is 1/125th; that's 1 slash 125. Over.
Roger, Houston. One twenty fifth.
Getting edgy already down there.
Houston, 14.
Go ahead, 14.
Bruce, it'll probably be 15 minutes or so before we finish getting some chow, and we'll start up into that tunnel for you.
Roger. We're standing by down here. We've got the color converter going so we can watch you in glorious living color. And just give us a yell when you're ready to go.
Wilco.
14, this is Houston. When you get around to the hatch removal in the tunnel, we'd like to get a LM/CM Delta-P reading prior to your equalizing the pressure. Over.
Rog, Bruce. We'll give you that.
Roger.
Stuart, how is your peanut butter?
Hey, Big Jack, not enjoying any peanut butter.
Coz you're doing a good job.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
14. Go ahead.
Roger. If you're about wound up on eating, I've got a correction to the inflight erasable load of Tephem for you, and we'd like to suggest a change to the DAP to open you up to a 5-degree deadband to save a little fuel. Over.
Okay. We'll call you back in a minute.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. 14's ready to copy Tephem.
Roger, Apollo 14. This is a correction to the inflight erasable load procedure for Tephem as found on page G9-4 of the G&C Checklist. Under column B, line 04 now reads 33304, and should be changed to read 35242. Line 05, under column B, now reads 07000, and should be changed to read 03262. Over.
Okay. Page now - 9-5, that is. How about giving it to me again? 9-4, that is. Go ahead.
Roger. That's page 9-4. Under the OID line number 04 in column B for Buffalo, you'll find the entry 33304; that should be changed to read 35242. Over.
Okay. 04 Bravo, 35242.
Right. And the next entry directly below it on OID line 05 now reads 07000, and that should be changed to read 03262. Over.
Okay. 05 Bravo should read 03262.
Roger. Readback correct. And on your DAP, we're recommending an R1 load - Okay, I see that you've got it already. Sorry about that.
Houston.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Roger, Houston; 14. I've got the camera set up and we're starting to work on the tunnel now. When you're configured for television, we'll let you have it.
Roger. We're configured, and let me see if we're ready to have you send it down. Roger. Let her rip.
You have it.
Stu, this is Houston. Before you equalize, would you give us the LM/CM Delta-P?
Rog. We're working on that.
Rog.
Roger, Bruce. And it's 0.5.
Understand 0.5?
That's affirmative.
Roger. Out.
Okay, Houston. We're starting to bring our pressure up until in the tunnel.
Roger.
Okay. Delta-P to zero.
Roger.
Houston, we're starting to bring the hatch out now and put it on the foot of the couch.
Roger. Out.
You're not getting very much light down there, Houston, but that's the hatch going under the left-hand couch.
Roger, Ed. Even with the low level of light, we're getting a pretty good picture here, especially after it's color converted.
Can you see anything up in the tunnel, Houston?
We really aren't seeing much in the way of the docking mechanism there. Here we go. That looks better.
Okay, Houston, as we start the inspection, we find that the probe umbilicals are properly secured.
Houston. Roger. Out.
Okay, Bruce; I don't know how well you can follow with the TV camera down there, but I didn't see anything obviously wrong with the umbilicals, and the capture latch release handle lock was in the Lock position.
Roger. Thank you, Stu.
Okay. The capture latch release handle turned very easily, Bruce.
Roger; out.
You didn't notice any damage to the pyro cover or anything like that, did you?
No, I - I didn't, Bruce. I - I looked it over here with a flashlight and, gee, I can't - can't see anything out of the ordinary. We'll - we'll drag it down and take a look at the outside of it. But, I didn't see anything wrong with - with the pyro cover or any of the connections or anything like that.
Roger.
And, Stu, while you're at it, would you say that the force that it took to remove the probe up there from the tunnel area was high, low, or indifferent - or nominal?
Well, you know it's the first time I've done it without gravity helping a little bit - and pushing back, but I - I wouldn't say it was exceptionally hard. I sort of braced myself on the bottom of the tunnel and gave a pull and she came loose.
Roger.
Okay. We'd like you to examine the probe head as you're now doing with particular emphasis on any evidence of unusual shearpin shearing in the bushing hole there at the end, or foreign material in the capture latch release button area or foreign material or damage anywhere in the areas of the capture latch hooks.
Okay. We'll give it a go.
All right, Bruce. The first we looked we don't see anything obvious about it.
Okay...
If you could give us some instructions as to where you'd like to look, we'll try to play the camera right in on it for you.
And, Bruce, up here in the very tip of the probe - you know where the - the tower hooks on it, it looks clean. I don't see anything fishy about that right off the bat.
All right. Is that the bushing on the end you're describing to me, Stu?
Yeah.
Okay, 14, we'd like to get some closeup photos of the probe head around the capture latch release button of each capture latch hook; and if you find any scratching or damage up there - of that area in particular, also.
Okay, Bruce.
Houston, looking at the drogue, we see that there are three scratches - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - that are rough to the touch broken the surface of the drogue.
Al, this is Houston. You're coming through very weakly. Can you, maybe, put the mikes closer to your mouth? I think that might be the problem.
Okay, I was looking up and away from the mike when I was talking but, I was in the - up in the tunnel. I'm looking at the drogue and there are these three scratches which we described before that have - that feel rough to the touch. They've probably scratched the surface of the drogue - perhaps a fourth of an inch.
Roger.
Al, this is Houston. You mentioned the dimension associated with these scratches - You mentioned a quarter of an inch. Was that width or depth of penetration, or length or what? Over.
Yes, I was trying to describe the depth of penetration, and it's very difficult because we don't have any kind of gauge on it, but it has scratched the surface to a depth of perhaps - I don't know - 3 or 4 thousandths maybe. Very definitely scratched. It's rough to the touch.
Roger.
Now, I'm confused, CapCom. Is that - the scratch is of 3 or 4 thousandths?
Okay. Understand you're saying they're about 3 or 4 thousandths of an inch deep and on the order of a couple of inches long?
That's right. They're very light. They all - as I said before - radial scratches leading away from the apex of the drogue and some are about 2 inches long, one's about 1 inch long, one's about three-quarters, and one's about one-half inch long. These are apparently the marks made by the capture latches as they made the docking attempt and then backed in - cut into the surface of the drogue.
Roger, we copy.
Okay, when you get through taking some photos up there, we'd like you to take the capture latch release handle, pull, rotate it counterclockwise to the Cock position and then manually depress all three capture latch triggers at the base of the capture latch hooks, simultaneously, and verify that the capture latch release button should move forward to the lock position flush with the probe - bushing.
Okay. Why don't we do that and then when we get all through, we'll go through and get the pictures you want.
Roger.
And we're going to bring the drogue out, too, so you can take a look at it on the TV.
Roger, Stu; and after you do get it out, we'd like you to hold the TV steady on the area of the drogue where the scratches are for a couple of minutes and do likewise again on the capture latch area on the probe.
Okay.
Ah, Houston; I'm moving the television camera in on the drogue now. Al's going to put a light on it. It is pretty dark.
Roger.
14, this is Houston. We're getting a picture, but the illumination level isn't very good and I guess I - I for one can't see any scratches right here.
Roger; it is pretty hard to see it, Houston. It's the light level. We're going to try another little trick here. Let's see if we can get you some light.
Okay.
All right, Houston. We're going to move in on the - You're looking at the center of the drogue now and the scratches - you can see Stuart's thumb there. He's going to point to them and we'll see if we can get enough light for you to see them.
Okay.
Roger, we - we got that last one, Stu, and we got the one you're pointing at now.
And, Bruce. I think that this illumination will give - illumination will give it to you if you'll let me hold it for a minute here.
Okay.
Roger. We can see about five or six of these radial scratches in the present scene - right - right where you're looking there, about three of them. One...
Yeah, that's - that's affirmative, Bruce.
Okay, now, I guess that at the 4 o'clock position you got about three scratches and then at 8 o'clock, you've got one. Do you have anything up at noon?
That's affirmative, Bruce. There's one long one at 12 o'clock noon.
Roger.
From the looks and from the feel, I believe it appears that the probe hit the drogue almost dead center every time we tried to make contact. But, it just rebounded right off of it.
Roger; we copy.
Okay, we're going to put the drogue back in place if you're through with it now.
Negative, we'd like you to hold it out for a minute or so. We ultimately want to wind up fit checking the drogue and probe here.
Okay, back on the probe, we'd like you to take the capture latch release handle, pull, rotate counterclockwise to the Cock position or a 150-degree rotation.
Okay, I've done that.
Okay, now manually depress all three capture latch triggers at the base of the capture latch hook simultaneously and verify that the capture latch release button in the end of the probe moves forward to the Lock position; that is flush with the probe pushing.
Okay, you want us to push all three of them simultaneously, is that right?
That's right.
All right. Say it again, and verify what?
Okay, the little button right at the tip of the probe which is the capture latch release button from the LM active side - where you got your finger - should pop out flush when you trigger all three of these latches simultaneously.
Got it. Is it flush? Okay I'm going to pull back in and it came out - it appears to be almost flush. Stu says that's counted as flush, the way it is now.
We're going to repeat it, Houston.
14, Houston. We're requesting Medium Beamwidth on the High Gain Antenna and we're going to have to handover from Goldstone here shortly.
we repeated that, and it - it comes out - flush.
Roger.
In looking at that button, do you notice anything unusual about it - any burrs, any bending, or any way it could be hanging up on something?
Say again, Ed. We had some static.
Stand by. We are looking at it now.
Al's taking a look at it. The top of the button looks smooth. Of course, you can't see down below it. But it seems to keep from knocking - releases fairly easily. It doesn't appear to be sticking at all.
Okay. I guess that's what we really wanted to know about it.
14, Houston. If you could - on the TV pictures - refrain from using the flashlight in close here, I think we've got enough light to - to see it with the ambient light.
Okay.
Maybe you do. We don't seem to.
Okay. We got 30 seconds to handover; so we're going to - just go into a standby mode here for a minute or so until Honeysuckle picks up.
Okay.
And, Ed, now that you've got the capture latches in the Locked position out there on the end of the probe, we'd like you to push as hard as you conveniently can in zero-g on each of the capture latches and verify that they do not depress.
Right. We've done that. We'll do it again, and they don't.
Okay.
Houston, they're not going to go in that way.
Okay. They shouldn't.
Okay, 14. Now we'd like you, using tool B or some other suitable tool, to depress the capture latch release button in the end of the probe there to cock the capture latches.
Roger. Stand by.
Houston, we can cock the capture - capture latches by pressing in the button on the end of it.
Roger. And now that you've got the drogue out, we'd like you to position the drogue and push it over the capture latches until the capture latch release button extends; and, I guess we'd like you to do this several times and try applying different combinations of offset, side load, and torque on the thing, and check it up for any indications of dragging, binding, or anything it might be giving the problem that you experienced a few hours ago.
Okay. Say again now how you would like - like us to cock the capture launches in the way we just did by depressing the button on the end of the probe. And then fitting it over - into the drogue several times and repeat this operation. Is that correct?
That's correct. If you put the probe in a fixed place and then put the drogue over it, you could sight in through the hole on the end of the drogue and keep a good eye on things.
Roger; understand.
14; and, one of these times when you have the drogue on over the end of the probe, you might try just holding the drogue in position and wiggling the capture latch release button in and out several times. In this condition, it won't do anything but it will allow you to assess the possibilities of binding or sticking of that particular part of the mechanism.
Okay, Houston.
Houston, I'm going to get rid of the TV camera for a minute. It's not doing us any good and it's taking all three of us to handle it.
Okay. Roger.
And it appears we may have to get on the LM side to do this. There's not quite enough room here to work.
Okay.
Ed, this is Houston. Have you had any - luck, I guess you could call it - in getting the probe and drogue to bind by applying lateral forces to the drogue?
Not yet. Stand by; we're getting ready to try it again now.
Oh, okay.
Hey, Bruce, there just wasn't any place that worked handily with that. We're going to put the drogue back in - Al's on the other side - and then we can put it up in there right.
Okay. By the other side, do you mean over in the LM?
That's affirmative.
Houston, 14.
Go ahead, 14.
Okay, Bruce. We cycled it - oh, about four or five times, and it goes in just so easily. The capture latches dock and hold it, and we've tried it by putting the capture latch release handle at 150 and putting it up and they move in. We've tried it by leaving it - you know, the yellow - and cocking them by pushing in on the end of the probe on the probe release plunger. And it works both ways, just real fine.
So, what you're trying to tell me is you still haven't come up with anything that would be the problem.
That's basically it.
Would you pass over to Al that, while you've got the probe and drogue in the tunnel there and mated - He's on the other side - and keeping them engaged, would he push the capture latch release button in and out several times and see if he can make it stick up against the bushing by pushing sideways, or anything of that sort, on it while it's being pushed in and out.
Okay. We'll try that.
14, this is Houston. While you're up there in the tunnel, we'd like to get a roll angle read-out on - from the index mark as you come back through; and, with respect to further procedures, I guess we got a - a write-in comment down here which is a step that says further instructions will follow tomorrow.
Didn't quite understand all that, Bruce. But try it, try us again.
Okay, we're asking for a docking tunnel roll index reading at your convenience, and...
Okay, we got that.
You've exhausted our imaginations for right now on troubleshooting the probe. We'll work on it some more overnight and be back with you in the morning.
Roger, Houston. Understand.
And would you confirm that Al was unsuccessful in getting the capture latch release button to bind up against that bushing in the end of the probe?
That's a - that's a negative, Bruce. We've cycled it several times; and he pushed on it and tried to jimmy it; and we - The thing slides in just so easily and locks up; and, when he pushes on the - on the plunger, why she releases very easily; and we can't seem to find any bind or get it to malfunction for us at all.
Okay. Well, holding the - holding the probe in place there, we were wanting him to just take and cycle the capture latch release button in and out several times, trying to - doing his best to bind it up against anything he can find there in the way of the internal surface of the bushing. I guess you're telling me that he was unable to.
Okay. Well, we hadn't really run that specific test. We'll try that.
Houston, we're bringing Al back through. We cannot force it to malfunction at all. So, you'll have to think about it overnight.
Roger, 14. We'll do that. We recommend that after you get Al back on the Command Module side, you reinstall the drogue and the Command Module hatch and keep the probe over in the Command Module. We believe we've seen enough TV data for the time being, so you can shut down the television at your convenience. And we would like to get photographic documentation of the capture latch release button, of each capture latch hook, and of any areas of scratches or visual damage on the probe, Ed.
And, Houston, the docking roll index is plus 0.9.
Understand. Plus 0.9 on docking roll.
That's affirmative.
Roger. Very good.
And, Stu; this is Houston. You're cleared to start getting set up for a PTC at your convenience. We'll be watching the rates; and, on this first PTC initiation, we'll probably want to go very close to the full 20 minutes of rate damping, although we expect that on subsequent ones during the mission, we'll have a better feel for it and just be able to cue you as to when to initiate the roll based on the rates that we're observing. Over.
Okay, understand. And we don't mind waiting 20 minutes.
Roger.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. When you do close the hatch in the LM, we'd like you to give us a mark so we may confirm the Floodlights, Off, over.
Roger; stand by.
Roger. We weren't intending to rush you on it. Just when it happens, give us a yell.
Wilco.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead.
I've got a comm configuration for you to set up in here for PTC.
Okay, Freddo. Standby.
Okay, Freddo. Go ahead.
Okay. You can set the High Gain Pitch and Yaw indicators to Pitch, minus 52; and Yaw, 270 degrees and then select Omni Bravo.
Roger. 52, 270, up to Bravo.
Okay. And then Track to Manual, and Wide Beamwidth.
You have it.
Okay, Ed.
(Cough) Houston, Apollo 14.
Go ahead, 14.
Rog, Freddo. We were busy with the probe at 11 hours, and we're inquiring about turning off the waste storage vent valve and shifting our heater configuration on the O2 tanks.
Okay, Ed. Waste Storage Vent can go to Close and on the heater configuration, 1 and 2, to Off; 3 to Auto.
So be it.
And, Apollo 14; Houston.
Go ahead.
Did you all by chance vent the batteries back at 11 hours, then?
Neg, Fred. I'm getting ready to do that now.
Okay, Ed. I was going to suggest you do that before we get the PTC, so we get all that closed up.
Houston, 14.
Go ahead, 14.
Okay, Fred. Al's closed the LM hatch and he verified the floodlights went out - Went out before the hatch closed.
Okay. They say they saw it here on the power...
That may have been - Say again.
They saw it down here, too, on the power, I guess.
Okay. And I'd like to clarify one thing. Seemed like Bruce implied that we would keep the probe in - in here with us, and we'd just like to store it in the - in the drogue for the night. It's so easy just to open the hatch and get it back out again if we want to dissect it tomorrow or something.
Yeah, that sounds all right, Stu.
Okay.
And, 14; Houston,
Go ahead.
Okay, I'd like to verify that you have the Waste Stowage Vent to Close now.
Okay. That's verified, Fred. We're still venting the battery.
Okay.
Houston, 14.
Go ahead, 14.
Freddo, the battery vent seems to have stopped at a reading of about 2 and a half volts. It dropped very quickly to that and it's been staying there. Can you tell if the vent is complete?
Stand by 1.
Sorry about that; 0.25.
Okay. Did you correct that, Ed, and say 0.25?
That's right; 2 and a half units, Freddo; 0.25 volts.
Okay.
Okay, 14. That reading will be okay.
14, Houston. Did you copy? The 0.25 reading is good enough, Ed.
Thanks, Freddo. And battery vent is terminated.
Okay.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. If you can give us Accept there, we'll pump you up a state vector and I have P37 block data for you.
Okay. Stand by 1.
There's P00 and Accept.
Okay.
Okay, Freddo. Go ahead with the P37.
Okay. Stand by 1.
Okay, Ed. P37 block data: 025:00; 4971; minus 165; 069:12; 035:00; 7548; minus 165; 068:35.
Hold it, Freddo.
Okay.
I thought you were reading me a P37 block data.
That's what it says.
All right. Let's start over again. GETI.
Okay. GETI, 025:00; 4971; minus 165; 069:12. That's GET at 400K.
Roger. 025:00.
Go ahead.
How many are you going to read me up?
Four of them, Ed.
Okay. Didn't understand. Press on.
Okay. The next one: 035:00; 7548; minus 165; 068:35; and the third one is 045:00; 5725; minus 165; 092:58; and the last one, 060:00; 5242; minus 165; 117:02.
Okay. 025:00; 4971; minus 165; 069:12; 035:00; 7548; minus 165; 068:35; 045:00; 5725; minus 165; 092:58; 060:0; 5242; minus 165; 117:02.
Okay. And remarks. The second through the fourth sets are, Ed, the 35-hour, 45-hour, and the 60-hour block data assumes a midcourse 2.
Understand. 35, 45, and 60 hours assume midcourse 2.
That's affirm, Ed. And we're still watching your rates here. We'll give you the word when we're ready for the PTC.
Thank you.
And, Apollo 14; Houston. You can go back to Block on the computer.
Okay.
Okay, Fred, and we got the hatch back in, and when I put the probe up for stowage, I looked again at that pyro cover that Bruce had asked me about before, and I can't see anything wrong with the probe anywhere.
Okay.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
It looks like you quit moving around in there, Ed. The rates are down. I guess y'all can crank up PTC.
Okay.
Be right with you, Fred.
Don't worry.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Just a reminder. You might make sure you've - brushed your teeth and all that kind of stuff before tucking her in there, before you crank up that PTC.
Rog.
Houston, 14.
Go ahead, 14.
Okay, Fred. I'm going to spin it up. I'm going to use B/D roll if that's agreeable with you.
Okay. That'd be fine.
Okay.
And, Houston; 14.
Go ahead.
Hey, Fred, I guess we've already said everything we can to try to help you all out on that probe. We're sitting here trying to run back over. I want to make sure that we're not overlooking something that might give you a clue. And, when we did our docking, as - as I was thrusting plus-X and then Al hit the retract, he said the talkbacks came back barber pole for - a time period; you know, like a couple of seconds before - and then went gray again when we got the - the dock. Now I'm just tossing that in. I think we called that, but I just wanted to make sure we've covered everything.
Okay. We - we had already gotten that, Stu, from your previous comments.
Okay. I just thought maybe there in the rush of things, you know, we might not got it in. I can't think of anything else to - to add, I guess.
Okay, Stu. I guess we got nothing else on the drogue/probe business. Just wanted to verify that you get the LiOH canister changed, and your PTC startup looks good.
Okay, Freddo. We got the LiOH changed at, let's see, let's check the time; 13:07.
Okay, Ed.
14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. You can terminate battery charge now.
Okeydoke.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Ed, for some reason, we're showing your PTC has gone out of the - gone out of the box, there; so in a bit, here, we're going to need to reinitialize, but would like to continue with the roll here until we get in good shape on the omnis again.
Roger. Stu. Wait until we finish this P52.
Rog.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, whenever you get a chance, after the 52 there, I guess you can stop the PTC and reinitialize; we're in good Omni; read you now.
Okay.
And, 14; Houston. We're not really sure what caused the PTC to diverge. It looked like a pretty good start unless you either vented something or maybe something continued to vent from a while back.
That's the more likely - we had a continuing vent.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 14.
Go ahead. And we got your Noun 93s.
Oh, gosh. Did you give them the torquing time of 14:12:50?
Okay.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
14, we're having a little trouble with data dropout in your present position. We'd like Omni Charlie.
Say again, Fred, will you? You busted up on that one.
Okay, Stu. We're having data dropouts. We'd like Omni Charlie.
Okay, Fred. Try us again real slow. You're - you're just coming in syllables.
Okay. We would like Omni Charlie, Omni Charlie.
Okay.
Okay, there's Omni (cough) Omni Charlie. How's that?
Okay. How do you read me now?
Okay. You're loud and clear.
Roger. We were having some data dropouts on High Bit Rate there, Stu, and we - before we get ready to crank up PTC, we'll have you go back to Bravo then.
Okay.
14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We're showing O2 flow pegged high down here. Just wondered if you're getting that on board, too.
Yeah, we are, Freddo.
Okay.
We thought we'd stopped all - stopped all of the venting, but we apparently are still venting somewhere we're not aware of.
Okay.
14, Houston.
Go ahead, Freddo.
Just a question. Did I understand you to say that you had checked, and you got all of your vents closed up now?
That's affirmative, Freddo. We're looking right now to see if we can find where this is going. Stand by to mark.
14, Houston. Did you change anything now? We're seeing the O2 flow dropping off a bit.
Did you see any marked change? We just...
Well, it was up over 0.9 there, Ed, and it's down around 0.7. Gone back up now, though; 0.8 something now.
14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Our - original thoughts were that it might be a 'ducer. If you haven't already done so, you might run through ECS MAL 1a and see how you come out of that one.
Well, Freddo, we can see the venting right now. We think we've got an actual problem.
Okay. What side of the spacecraft, 14?
Now it's coming out the port side.
Okay, the port side.
14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We saw it drop off. I guess you cycled the Regs, Ed. So that would indicate the 'ducer's okay. You might check again the valve on top of the urine receptacle and make sure that guy is closed off.
Yeah, we're rechecking those now Freddo.
Yes, Fred, I did that. And, in fact, I even closed the - the waste management dump just to see if Myrtle was leaking, but it didn't do any good.
Okay.
14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. You seeing any more venting overboard at this time?
That's affirmative, Fred. I was just sitting here watching it - just - it - it comes in spurts. Just about 30 seconds ago, we got a nice splash, and there's some right now. Looks like it's coming, you know, from over in the area of the - of the normal dumps.
Rog.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Gee, that oxygen flow looked like it had settled down there around 0.4, and then all at once it started - it jumped up again there just a half a minute ago or so. And, it looks like it's back down again. Did you all move anything else in that area?
Yeah, Fred. We went back, cleaning up after that malfunction, and we had the Water Glycol valves Off and the emergency Regs, and Suit Demand; we didn't see any effect when we went through it. And then we just went and opened them up again, here?
Okay.
It's settled down on our meter at 0.6 pounds an hour now, Freddo.
Okay.
14, Houston.
Go ahead, Freddo.
Ah, I guess we're happy with that O2 flow you got now. It looks pretty stable, and the vehicle rates look okay to crank up a PTC again. We think we have got a handle on what happened except in - what really caused the first O2 Flow High. Must be something you readjusted.
I don't know that we can have a good answer for you. Stu and I were just talking about. We think quite possibly the - urine dump is leaking. We got it cycled now and shut clear off. Let's see if that helps any.
Okay.
And, 14; Houston. We'd like Omni Bravo.
Okay.
Houston, this is Al. We're going to presleep checklist now. We thought we'd drop off a little bit early tonight.
Okay.
Houston, we're bringing direct O2 valve, On, to pump the cabin up to 5.7 now.
Okay.
And, 14; Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
We're configured down here to take the E-memory dump any time. Stand by 1. I'm going to check the - how the Omnis are.
Okay, Fred. We ought to have you now. How do you read?
Houston, 14. How do you read?
Okay. Loud and clear, Stu. Stand by 1.
Okay.
Okay. We're ready now, Stu, for the E-memory. They're all set.
Okay.
Houston, onboard readouts, if you're ready to copy.
Okay, Fred, here comes the Verb 74. 4. Now.
Okay. Go ahead, Ed.
Okay. Bat C is 37. Pyro Bat A, 37.45; Pyro Bat B, 37.45; RCS A, 88; B, 90; C, 87; D, 91.
Okay.
Houston, do you read 14?
Houston, do you read 14?
Go ahead, 14.
Go ahead, 14; Houston here.
Apollo 14, Houston. How do you read?
14, Houston. How do you read?
Houston, do you read 14?
14, Houston. Read you loud and clear.
Hello, Houston. How do you read 14?
14, Houston. How do you read me?
Oh, you're loud and clear. There was a lot of static and no reception on - I guess that other antenna.
Okay. We had to drop Madrid and try to reacquire there to get you back. Could you verify that you are on Omni Bravo there, Stu?
That's affirmative; Omni Bravo.
Okay.
And if you don't have anything else for us, we're about to secure here.
Stand by 1, Stu.
14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Just one more thing, I'd like to confirm the H2 fans, Off.
Okay. Well, they were on; they're off now, Fred.
Roger, Stu. I guess you can take the rest of the day off.
Okay.
14, Houston.
Houston, did you call 14?
Yes. Right, Stu. One last thing. Looks like maybe an O2 tank number 1 heater is on. Tank 2 switches should be number 1 and 2, Off; number 3 on Auto.
Okay. 3 is Auto, and 1 and 2 O2 tanks are Off.
Okay. We'll leave you alone, now.
Okay.
