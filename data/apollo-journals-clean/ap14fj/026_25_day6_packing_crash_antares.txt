Okay, we capture.
Okay, we're Free.
Beautiful. Normal docking.
Stand by for those latches.
There we go.
Okay.
Okay. And we got hard dock.
Ripplefire again.
Let me look at that schedule.
Beautiful. There's a big sigh of relief being breathed around here.
144:12. There we are.
All over the world, there is.
You ought to try it from up here.
(Laughter)
Okay.
Verify...
This world and out of this world, too.
Verify the Forward Dump Valve, Auto.
Okay, Forward Dump Valve's Auto. We ought to reconfigure VHF so - Stu won't have to listen to everything, even music.
Yes.
Let me - let me clean up over here and I'll be with you.
He can shut his off.
Yes. Okay, Forward Dump Valve's Auto.
Okay.
Okay. Now, Stu, I'll go...
Antares, Houston. When you have a moment, go to P00 and Data for us, and we've got an uplink for you. Good.
(garble)
Okay. You have it, Houston.
We'll have to hold. Why don't we take these things off?
Thank you.
Houston, are you going to give me the LM - Command Module weight?
Ed, this is Houston. Understand you want the Command Module weight now?
Whatever you have; I'm out, ready to copy.
Okay. CSM is 34727 and the LM is 5103. Over.
Understand. 5103, 34727.
That's correct, Ed.
Okay, Al. Cabin Fan 1, open.
Okay, Cabin Fan 1, open.
Okay. Put the window shades up.
And, Kitty Hawk; Houston. When you get through with what you're doing there, Stu, I do have Sep PAD for you and a - an updated DAP load, but there's no rush on either one.
Okay. I'll take the DAP load now. That's what I'm working on.
Roger. CSM is 34727.
Okay. 34727, thank you.
Okay, crash bars up.
LM, 5103.
Okay. For the first time in the flight.
Okay, and 05103.
We want to take this back, don't we?
What's that? Yes, you're damn right.
Roger. Out.
Antares, Houston. I have a LM impact P30 PAD for you when you're free.
Roger. Give me 5 seconds.
Okay, Attitude, Direct; TTCA, Disable; ACA/Jet, Disable.
Well, I guess we'd better get to cracking, troops. I've got to put your 160 pounds of rocks some place.
Yes, Can't do it until we get the tunnel open.
Roger. I'll be working on that in just a second here. I'll start equalizing.
Yes, it's going to take me awhile to copy these PADs, Al. So you'll have to press on with that.
Press on with what, Ed?
I said you're going to have to press on with that, because it'll take me a little while to get these PADs squared away.
Roger.
Okay, Antares. I'm going to be off the - off the air for about 3 minutes here.
Okay, Stu.
All right, Bruce, Go on your P30 PAD.
Say again, Ed.
I'm ready to copy P30 PAD.
Okay. P30 purpose, goodbye LM. TIG 147:54:18.90; Noun 81, minus 0182.0, plus 0039.0, plus all balls; H and H are NA; Delta-VR 0186.1; 1:15; 012, 176; minus 0181.9, plus 0039-0, minus 0006.0. Read back. Over.
I've got your impact P30 PAD. 147:54:18.90; minus 0182.0, plus 0039-0, plus all zeros; HA, HP, NA; 0186.1; 1:15; 012, 176; minus 0181.9, plus 0039.0, minus 0006.0. End of PAD.
Roger. And you've already got the LM weight.
That's firm.
Okay, Ed. If you would, we'd like a few words from you on the subject of the AGS. We've lost the AGS downlink telemetry and sort of at a loss as to what its current status is. Could you spare a little time for that?
Roger. It performed beautifully up until the time you asked me to check circuit breakers. I looked, and the circuit breakers are okay. I tried to look at it for a backup breaking gate about that time, and found I could not access it. Furthermore, the ball, the AGS ball, is still at 150 degrees pitch, zero yaw, zero roll and - has been for some time. And I had no warnings. All the circuit breakers were in, but I cannot access it to give a self test.
When was the last time you tried to access it, Ed?
Well, just now and -
Successfully?
oh - about - oh, shortly before we hit the breaking gate.
Roger.
Ed, this is Houston. We'd like you to - on panel 16, cycle the ASA and AE circuit breaker - AEA circuit breaker, if you would, please?
Okay. They're cycled. In further answer to that last question, Bruce. It was some - somewhere around AOS, but I don't remember exactly when.
Roger, Ed. That's close enough.
Good enough. I abandoned the AGS and started setting up the cameras for the docking about that point.
You coming out, Al?
No, I got the screw out all right, and it looks like that ought...
Okay, Ed.
Oh, those springs just hook; I think you can just get rid of them.
And, if you didn't see any change, we'd like you to take the AGS operate switch - the AGS Status switch and cycle it from Operate to Standby and back to Operate, and if that doesn't do any good, on panel 11, we'd like to close the Commander's AEA circuit breaker. Over.
Okay. That hasn't been any good. We'll try the other one.
Okay. I'm back now.
That doesn't seem to help either, Bruce.
Okay. Which one was that?
Any of them. I - I put in the Commander's circuit breaker and still has not gotten anywhere with it.
Okay. Let's skip the AGS and leave it in its present situation and I've got a few items I'd like to read off for return - over and above the nominal return items.
You've checked coming out of that - thing.
It's not?
Ed, this is Houston. I'd like to read you up some extra return items, if you've got a piece of paper around.
Okay, I'm ready to copy.
Okay, item number 1, the 100-foot tether. Over.
Okay, we got that one.
Number 2, the LEC waste/tether combination. Over.
Okay.
Number 3, 30-foot tiedown webbing. Over.
Okay.
Okay, I'm cracking the hatch now.
Item number 4 - -
Okay.
- We would like to bring -
Okay, Stu.
back the Commander's Hasselblad and recommend that that go in the ISA. If you want to bring back the LMP Hasselblad, also, that could go in B-l, but we need the Commander's Hasselblad. Over.
(Laughter) We thought about bringing them both back, but since you said not to, we left one on the surface. But you'll have the CDR's.
Man I can't figure out what the hell's - -
Roger, we copy. Item number 5, we want both of the LMP's EVA gloves. Over.
Okay, they're aboard.
And, of course, we're going to bring back the docking probe. Now, on stowage: the first three items, the tethers and the webbing, can go in the temporary stowage bags in the Command Module. The Hasselblad in the ISA, which is normal, and your gloves can go in the PGA bag, and the probe up underneath the right-hand couch in the temporary stowage location.
Okay, we've already stowed most of this stuff, Bruce. The tether - the 100-foot tether is already in the ISA; the LEC waste tethers can go in the TSB and so can the 30-foot tiedown webbing. The Commander's Hasselblad we can put in the ISA; the EVA gloves are already in the ISA.
I'm not going to be able to get it. I don't know what the hell's the matter with this thing.
Okay, stand by, please.
Just not going to come, huh?
No, I got those screws out Just fine. And that thing that looks like it's going to - supposed to flop down - ought to flop down? That little...
And it won't flop down?
split bearing, that bushing there?
Yes?
Can't get that to flop for sour owlshit.
Well, did you try to pry it on it?
Man, I've been trying to pry it and push it.
Well, that's supposed just to break right loose. Let's - let's look on the bottom. Did you?
See, it looks like it'd pivot.
Yes, it's supposed to.
Well, let's leave this stuff right here for the moment.
Okay. Stu's cracking the hatch.
Yes, stay on our time line. Okay, this purse ought to go in the - ISA bottom forward pocket.
Okay, going to keep us honest?
Trying to.
Ed, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
We'd like to get the - the tethers, especially the 100-foot tether, out of the ISA, because you're going to be bagging the ISA in a - a contamination bag, and we plan on using the 100-foot tether, the LEC waste tether, and the 30 feet of tiedown for securing the docking probe for reentry; so we'd like - if you can do it without impact, we'd like you to get that stuff out before you put the ISA in the contamination bag. All the other stowage is okay. Over.
Okay, we'll see what we can do.
Did you hear that?
We've got lots of time to do that cn the way home.
Well...
Roger.
No, but we've got to put it in the Decon bag just a little while. If we can rip that 100-foot tether out right now, why, we'll save ourselves a lot of headache.
Okay.
Okay.
If you could stick this in there when you're getting in -
Okay, I guess I'll Just have to - get baby now, huh?
Kitty Hawk, Houston. Are you back on the line? Over.
That's affirmative.
Okay. I don't want to interrupt, but whenever you're free, I've got your Sep PAD.
Okay, Al, empty your PGA pockets into the accessory...
Okay, why don't I take it now? I'm waiting for a hatch check here.
accessory bag in the flight data file.
Okay.
Okay, let me know when you're ready.
Well, let her rip.
Okay. CSM Sep, RCS, TIG, 146:30:00.0; Noun 81, minus 0001.0; Y and Z are all zips; roll, 301, 355, 348; the rest of the PAD is NA; remarks, LM-jettison time, 146:25:00; and the roll, pitch, and yaw for LM jettison are the same as for Sep. Over.
Okay. Sep PAD, 146:30:00.00; Delta-VY, minus 1.0, all zips, all zips; 301, 355, 348; jettison, 146:25:00.00; 301, 355, and 348.
Okay, can I pass it on to you so I can get - get on back to work here?
Roger.
Where do you want to put it, back in the data file?
Huh? Well, that's as good a place as any right now.
Yes.
Okay, Bruce. I'm ready to copy any PADs you have for me.
You can - Al, you can place the LEVA bags on the floor, right side and forwards.
Ed, this is Houston. I believe we're up to date already on you.
Okay. I misunderstood. I thought you had a call for me a minute ago.
Okay, let's take the LEVA bags.
Okay.
One - We'll put them on the floor, right side forward. Both of them, both of them.
(garble)
Man, that was a beautiful rendezvous.
Sure was.
Everything worked perfect. Okay, here they come. Right side forward.
Kitty Hawk, Houston. We'd like to get P00 and Accept, if that's convenient with you, and confirm all the Rotational Hand Control Power Direct switches, Off, please.
Okay. You've got P00 and Accept and Direct, Off.
Okay. Let me turn these lights off, and we can cut those bastards off, anyway.
Roger. Out.
Okay, Just a minute. Let me - -
Stu, are the pressures equal in the tunnel yet?
That's affirmative. I'm about to drop the hatch.
Okay. Overhead Dump Valve, Auto, Al.
Overhead Dump Valve's in Auto.
Okay. Press Regs A and B, Egress.
Okay. A is Egress, B is Egress.
Okay. Stow the 70-millimeter camera with Mag in ISA bottom pocket.
And, Ed, did you verify, or Al, the Forward Dump Valve to Auto?
That's verify, Stu.
Okay.
Okay.
How dusty was it down there?
We don't have a lot of dust in here, but our suits are sure filthy.
Okay.
Okay.
Where's the tool kit?
It's hanging on the instrument panel. Going to try yours?
Yes, but I want to get this cable over here first.
Okay. You can put the - camera - this camera in the ISA top pocket.
Okay. Stand by.
In the bag.
Say, I'll tell you; there's one thing about this data file. It Just is not made for me.
Yes, it's not the easiest one to work with.
That son of a bitch is all full.
Well - What's all full?
The damn data file. Yes, I can get it in there, I guess.
Well, it ain't going to make it.
What's not going to make it?
Well, it's part of the data file; it's rendezvous charts.
Well, stick it in the purse.
Well, that data file is supposed to be available to us - yes, put it in the purse - should be available to us in debriefing.
Yes, we can get it out of the purse.
Okay.
Okay, let me get this. Are we through with the purse?
You can put this in it. This you give me goes in the ISA top pocket.
Get your scissors?
No, I don't. Where - They're in the data file.
Okay
Just stick them in the acessory bag there with that other personal stuff that we find, unless you want to use it.
Yes, Better cut those lights off again.
Cut what?
Cut those lights off.
What lights?
The...
Utility lights?
Yes.
Well, hell, I've got dikes for that, Al, and I just reach up and take them off like this.
Okay. Just stick those in the purse.
Here they are.
Here's all the goodies.
Kitty Hawk, Houston. Computer is yours.
Okay.
Put them in there.
One of them's still warm.
Huh?
That camera's still warm.
It is? Well, hell, it was running just a minute ago.
Okay, Al, now that you got those out of the way.
Well, I haven't got them out of the way. I'm going to put them in the ISA.
Okay.
Now, you want me to get the ISA - you want me to get 100-foot tether out of there?
Yes, you'd better.
Okay. Why don't you hold the purse, and let me get the ISA down, then.
Okay.
Because we - I'll have to get into it - Damn - Have to get into it to find out what we're looking for there.
We're - running kind of late.
Well we can always get it up on the way back.
Well we got to stow this damn -
Kitty Hawk, Houston. Were you calling?
Well if you can find it handy, go get it, Al. Otherwise, don't.
It's not a - it's not a 100-foot tether; it's a 50-foot tether. You talking about the one in that bag?
That's negative, Bruce.
Roger. Out.
Yes, they want the one we took out on the lunar surface.
Yes. It's 50 feet.
It's 100 - It's supposed to be. Well, there's 50 for you and 50 for me but -
Shit.
I don't know. I don't feel it in there, anyway.
You sure you put it in there and not in the other compartment?
Shoot, I don't know. I thought we stuck it in here. Look in the purse; maybe it's in there.
No. Well, we really haven't got time to look for it. We're just going to have to - -
I don't think so. Give me the-- stick the purse in here.
Huh?
Stick the purse in here.
Okay.
I got one more item - a couple of more items, if it'll go.
In the ISA?
Yes. Did you get the PPKs and the flag kit out?
No, hell no. You didn't tell me to.
Okay.
Got plenty of room in that.
Okay.
Plenty of room.
Okay. Ail this stuff -
Huh?
These, we'll just forget about and stick them back. I don't know what they are.
All right. Those are in.
Pardon?
Those are all in. What's next?
Okay.. Flag kit, unstow sample bag, left-hand stowage compartment, temporarily stow in aft cabin under netting.
In aft cabin under netting?
Yes, just hide it out of the way.
You mean the rocks?
Yes. So we can put them in Decon bags later, Al.
I think I'll Just leave them right where they are.
Why now?
No, no, we don't want to because the goddarn drogue comes in here, gets in the way.
Okay, it's...
Could you stuff them back there lander the netting somewhere?
Okay?
Okay, open the hatch.
Apollo 14, this is Houston; 12 minutes to LOS.
Okay, Bruce.
We got to get the hatch open; we're - we're about 20 minutes late.
Stu's working on it now; I can hear him. Hell, we can open the hatch, anyway.
Yes, open ours.
Let me just go to DUMP on this valve, just to be sure. Look at Delta-P across here.
Is it?
Yes.
Well, the Delta-P's higher on our side, then. There shouldn't be any Delta-P from his side.
Okay, we just went up a little bit.
Okay, watch the ISA for a minute.
Why don't you grab the drogue and bring it on in and tie it down?
Okay. Let's see. Hey, that baby's hot.
Okay, here comes the drogue. Howdy, how are you doing?
Okay.
Nice docking.
Man!.
It worked okay that time, huh?
Yes. It sure did. I even... too....
Yes, I got the ISA out of your way.
Okay. Reach.
back and safe.
Hold on just a second. Grab the LEC - package out of there. That's the waste-tether package, isn't it?
I think so. Yes.
And the two - and the two brushes?
Yes.
Okay. Let me have them.
Do we need the waste tether to tie down?
Yes.
Okay.
I got nothing else in there we need. Here's some tape. Do we need that?
Okay. Tape, we need.
Okay, can you tie that drogue down there?
Sure. Sure can.
Okay, there's nothing else in those pockets now that we need back there, is there?
I don't know; I was going to look at it.
Double check because I - There shouldn't be, because I've gotten them all out, but -
Here's your pills.
Okay, tie it down and let's move on.
Oh, another thing, we have those rocks in there. You got the rocks out so we're all set. Okay, it's tied down.
Okay.
Hey, Stuart. We'll take our helmet - accessory bags first, if you don't mind.
Hell, the accessory bags.
I mean helmet bags; we've got the accessory bags.
You ought to put something in those. What did we put in there? We put a glove or something of yours in one cf those, didn't we?
What?
Okay, it's tied down. Okay, the drogue's tied down. What's next?
Okay, that's all. Now help me get this - We need the Decon bags, the helmet bags, and start getting stuff over to Stu.
Okay.
Hey, Al.
Yes.
Remember where you put these? I don't believe I've seen them.
Yes, they're in the temporary stowage bag on your side, I think.
Okay.
Let's see.
Why don't you put your helmet, your gloves, and your helmet -
There's one glove.
You lost a glove?
Yes, it's floating around somewhere.
Here, let me take...
Zipping what?
Start unzipping these suits.
Okay.
Apollo 14, this is Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 14, Houston. With 3 minutes and 45 seconds to LOS, both vehicles are Go on all systems. We'll see you on the other side. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 14. Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read?
Apollo 14. Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 14. Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
Houston, 14. Read you loud and clear.
Roger, 14. I'm reading you down in the mud, here; but I can understand what you're saying. How are you progressing on the closeout?
You're coming in 5 square here; so, if you've got anything to say, we might can pick it up. And we're pressing along nicely.
Roger. For your information, although I don't want to make this a formal flight-plan update at this time, after TEI, there will be no lunar topo, that is, no Hycon-camera photos. Do plan on taking the - Hasselblad shots, and the visual assessment of targets 1 and 2. But right after your DAP load at 150 hours plus 32 minutes, you can plan on initiating PTC and then initiating sleep. Over.
I don't believe that will be a hard one to fill.
I didn't figure you'd fight us on it.
Houston, 14.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Bruce. What are we going to do about this closeout of the LM? Just ignore the AGS, huh? And stay with the PGNS? And everything else the same?
Stand by, Ed.
Antares, Ed; this is Houston. On the configuration, you may just leave the AGS in its current configuration. No need to target it or even fool around with it. And we'll be talking to you as you progress through the closeout. This does not constitute a Go for closeout. Over.
Roger; Roger. Understand.
Antares, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Antares, this is Houston. We'd like you to go through the DAP-loading procedure at the top of page 15 in your LM Timeline Book. We don't show the 12021 loaded in the DAP. Over.
That's affirm, Houston. I haven't - I deliberately held off on that one.
Roger. We're showing some RCS thruster firings that maybe aren't necessary.
Okay, loading it now.
Houston, 14.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Roger, Bruce. I'm at the - ready for IVT to the Command Module.
Okay. Stand by, and I'll try and get you a Go.
Oh, Bruce. The thing we're short on is getting the comm up here the way you want it. I don't -you haven't given me any steerable angles to set on.
Okay, Ed; you can go ahead and configure the comm at this time. The nominal values in the Flight Plan. Pitch, minus 40; Yaw, plus 49, are valid. Over.
Okay, I'll use those.
Houston, your steerable is beeped up, and on SLEW,
Roger, Ed; the comm looks good to us and now we need RBTs 5 and 6 on both Normal and Backup Feed, over.
Okay. That's what I was waiting for. Here we go.
Antares, this is Houston. You're Go for final closeout; good bye. Over.
Okay, so long; see you on the other side.
Roger; out.
Houston, 14.
14, this is Houston. Over.
Okay, I'm bringing on the Logic switches.
Roger; stand by for Pyro Arm.
Okay, Bruce. Logic is On.
Roger, Stu; stand by.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. You are Go for Pyro Arm, over.
Okay, thank you.
Houston, 14. I still have Go for jettison on time, 146 plus 25?
Stand by, Stu.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. You are Go for a LM jettison on time. The only thing we see is P47, when you get down to it in the time line just before Jett. Over.
Okay. I'll get my pyros - armed In a.
Say again about the pyros armed.
Oh, I was just saying I was only missing one thing. I said I got to get my pyros armed, too.
Roger. We gave you a Go for...
I'm on the last two things on the checklist.
the pyro arm a while ago.
Roger. We don't mean to be backseat driving.
That's all right.
Houston, 14.
Houston, 14.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Can you verify you can get into the computer; or have you verified it?
Roger. The computer in the LM? Over.
That's affirm.
Roger, we have verified it.
Roger. Thank you..
Hey, it worked that time.
Roger, 14.
And we bid sayonara to Antares.
Roger, 14.
Okay, Houston, we're through with the LM Sep burn there, and we're maneuvering to the P52 ATT.
Roger, we copy; through with the Sep burn and maneuvering.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. We have approximately 10 minutes to LOS. After you arrive at your P52 attitude, we'll be ready to send you up a - a desired orientation uplink, and have you noticed any dust floating around?
Apollo 14, Apollo 14; this is Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Do you read 14?
Roger, 14.
14, this is Houston. Six minutes and 30 seconds to LOS. How do you read? Over.
You're completely unreadable, Houston. Everytime you talk, we drop the signal.
Roger. Stu, you're coming in pretty well now. We'd like to have you acquire us on the High Gain.
Houston, if you're asking for P00 and Accept, you have it.
Thank you. We also need the High Gain.
Apollo 14, Houston. How do you read?
Houston, everytime you transmit, our signal strength goes down, just right in synchronization with your words.
Roger, Out.
Houston, do you read 14?
Houston, if you're wanting P00 and Accept, you have it.
Houston, how do you read 14?
Apollo 14, this is Houston. Uplink complete. It's your computer. At 147 plus 10 plus 00, we'd like you to maneuver to roll, 026; pitch, 091; yaw, 000, for communications. High Gain will be Pitch, minus 10; Yaw, plus 183. I repeat roll, 026; pitch, 091; yaw, 000. High Gain: Pitch, minus 10; Yaw, plus 183; and the time for that is 147 plus 10. The normal time for the LTC photo PAD maneuver, LOS, Over.
Roger. Verify the roll, 026.
Verified.
Apollo 14, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston; 14.
Roger. You're loud and clear, Stu.
Likewise, Gordon.
Okay. I've got some PADs here, the TEI-34 and 35 PADs.
Well, we're mighty interested in the first one, anyway.
Okay. Let me know when you're ready to write.
I have pen in hand, awaiting your message.

TEI-35, SPS/G&N; the weight is 34720; minus 0.72, plus 0.08; 151:16:02.94; plus 3097.7, plus 1633.1, minus 0468.2; 178, 358, 359; ullage, four jets, ele - correction, four jets, 12 seconds. Go ahead.
Okay. TEI-35, SPS/G&N; 34720; minus 0.72, plus 0.08; 151:16:02.94; plus 3097.7, plus 1633.1, minus 0468.2; 178, 358, 359; four jets, 12 seconds
Okay, Stu. The readback is correct. I have some more information for this upcoming photographs with the 500-millimeter of the 13 S-IVB impact crater. Over.
Okay.
Okay. Give us P00 and Accept. We'll give you a state vector and target load while we're getting this.
Do you have it?
Okay. Information on the photo pass. At 148:15, maneuver to roll, 026; pitch, 104; yaw, 000. We. suggest you use magazine Papa, the same 500-millimeter COAS procedures as before. T-start is 148:23:03. For locating visually the target, we suggest you use the zero-phase landmark map 7 and 8. To refresh your memory, the impact crater is on the northeastern rim of Lansberg B located on a line from Lansberg B to Lansberg. So, these procedures - We want you to pitch at T-start plus 1 minute and ignore the ORDEAL. Do not use the ORDEAL numbers be - This is because of a misaline-ment due to the TEI REFSMMAT. The pitch should work out to be a pure pilot pitch. Over.
Okay. At 148:15, maneuver to 026, 104, 000. Use magazine P, the same 500-millimeter procedures. T-START at 148:23:03. Northeast rim of Lansberg B. I know the general area. I don?t know how good an area this type of photography covers, though.
I can - I think the field of view is probably noticed on your orbital maps there, if you want to look it up. I - I think I looked the one time. The 500-millimeter should just about catch all of Lansberg B, and - -
Yes. I - I thought it - Of course, I sort of got the impression today, Gordon, that - that it might have been narrower than that, but that's fine. I - I know the general area to photo.
And I guess you want me to do that after 1 minute, pitch to 328, and quit, huh?
The answer to that is affirmative. I have an up - -
And as soon as we finish that, we do the Verb 49. As soon as we finish that, then, we go right into a Verb 49 maneuver to the PAD burn attitude, right?
That's affirmative, Stu. I also have a map update for REV 35.
Go ahead.
Okay. It's your computer, now. We're through with the uplink., And LOS time is 148:50:34; 180 time: 149:15:29; AOS with TEI: 149:26:49; AOS without TEI: 149:36:45. Over.
Okay. I think the only one there that - give me the - I don't need the 180; but I got with TEI; AOS will be 149:26:49; without, 149:36:45. And give me LOS, again.
Okay. LOS, 148:50:35. You copied the AOSs okay.
14, Houston. For your information, there's about 3 minutes to the - 2 minutes and 50 seconds to the LM ignition.
Okay.
Stu, this is Houston.
Go ahead.
Stand by 1.
Okay, Stu. We took a look at your geometry when you're in this attitude prior to starting the COAS maneuver. It turns out that you're probably going to be able to see, through the optics, Antares hit the ground. If you wish and you have the time, one of the LM crew there could select P24, and we've got the numbers to set into Noun 89. And we'll give you a - an impact time. You may be able to see it hit.
Okay. P24, Noun 89. Ready to copy.
Okay. Right now, we may have an update on this with - after they track it, after the burn but right now, minus 03.527, minus 09.576, and a plus all balls. Over.
Yes, I copy minus 03.527, minus 09.579, plus all zips.
Okay. That second register, last digit is 6, minus 09.576.
Okay. Minus 09.576. And what's the time of impact?
Okay. impact time will be 148:22:19. This is about a minute and 40 seconds prior to when you'll start pitching for the - the COAS maneuver. Over.
Okay.
If it's handy and you wanted to try to photograph it through the sextant, we'd suggest using C-EX at a 24 frames per second, l/60th-of-a-second shutter speed, and start it at 30 seconds prior to impact, and let it run through to 30 seconds after. Over.
Okay.
And the LM is burning now.
Okay.
Houst - Houston, 14.
Go ahead.
Okay. Those other procedures called for 250 and f/11. Isn't it going to be a little darker over at Lansberg, Gordon? Do we want to change those settings?
Stand by, Stu.
Apollo 14, Houston. We'd like you to use f/ll, l/250th, focus infinity. Over.
Okay. f/11, l/250th, and infinity.
That's affirmative.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. That Noun 89 and the time of impacts for the - for Antares are good, after looking at it after its burn. And if you're going to - Are you going to be using the DAC on the sextant? If so, we'll call a start and stop time to you.
That's negative.,
Okay. And just one other thing. We want to be sure that we see P30 and P40 before your AOS. There shouldn't be any problem with them. Before your LOS.
Okay. We'll sure try.
We'll just let you look at them early, Gordon.
Roger. We're looking.
P40 looks good to us.
Okay.
Stu, this is Houston.
Go ahead.
We've got about 9 and a half minutes until LM impact. And at the risk of insulting your intelligence, we just wanted to remind you to - that, if you do reselect P30 between now and the - and the burn, be sure to reload the Noun 81s.
Okay. We won't reselect P30.
Roger.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
We'd like to have the Tape Recorder switch Forward prior to starting your COAS maneuver.
Yes. We'll give you a Forward and High Bit Rate.
Okay. Four minutes to impact, now.
impact in 3 minutes.
Stu, for your information, trunnion should be about 41 degrees at impact. So, it probably won't clear the limit until just before - just before impact.
Apollo 14, Houston. I've got a change to the setting on the Hasselblad, a last minute change. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. They want it at f/8 and l/125th of a second, f/8 and l/125th. Over.
14, Houston. Thirty seconds to impact.
Stu, 1 minute to T-start on the 500-millimeter.
T-start now, I believe.
You're right. My mistake.
Houston, 14....
14, Houston. Say again, please.
We were unable to see the LM impact in the optics.
Roger, Al. Unable.
14, Houston. We'd like a frame count on the Hasselblad, for this last pass here. Over.
Okay, stand by 1.
Okay, we went from 131 to 169, Gordon.
Roger. 131 to 169; and, for your information, both the ALSEP seismometers are ringing like mad.
14, Houston. Give us Omni Delta, please.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead.
14, Houston. We have about 16 and a half minutes to LOS. We'd like to see you in burn attitude and also get a look at P40 prior to losing you.
Okay, Gordon.... that.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Would you put the Tape Recorder switch to Forward; and then, we'll take care of commanding it for -for the upcoming LOS.
You have it.
Roger.
14, Houston. Nine minutes now to LOS. And we'd like to see you at burn attitude, if possible, before you go LOS.
Okeydoke,
14, Houston. For your information, in about 5 seconds, you'll be 30 minutes from ignition. I'll give you a mark. Ready -
MARK.
Okay, thank you.
14, Houston. P40 looks okay to us.
Thank you.
14, Houston. Two minutes to LOS.
Roger, Gordon.
Roger.
Roger, Gordon.
14, Houston, One minute to LOS, and we'll see you on your way home.
Roger, Gordon.
Roger, Gordon.
Your problem's loud and clear, Ed.
