Okay, Houston. The antenna blew over.
Roger, Antares.
Kitty Hawk, Houston. Are you having an SOS sandwich there for lunch?
Not quite, but I sure wish it was.
(Laughter) Okay. When you get a chance there, Stu, you can go ahead and terminate Bat A charge.
Okay. I'll do it right now.
Okay. And while you're floating over there, you might be advised that the TPI Delta-V will probably be - more than likely be - around 100 feet a second instead of about 90 or so, you know?
Okay.
And your ascent PADs are good the way they are.
Okay.
Antares is pressing on in good shape there. They're getting set for the liftoff, about 39 minutes yet. And, as you might notice here, we're on separate air-to-ground loops. So I'll be talking to you through this pass, and I'll relay all information on up to you. When you go to the P20 attitude, the Omni antennas just make all kinds of noise racket down here, so I may not be able to hear you, but I think you've been hearing me most of the time. So I'll just go ahead and relay, probably in the blind, most of the time line.
All right.
Kitty Hawk, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, Stu, we're going to bring the probe back with us, or you guys are, anyhow. And for TEI, just go ahead and stow it underneath the right-hand couch - you know, with the straps like we normally do, there, for temporary storage. And then, on the way - -
Okay.
- - back, we'll give you some permanent stowage instructions, during transearth coast. Also, your VHF acquisition time - that's when you come over the horizon for the VHF there - will be 142:20:18.
Okay, 142:20:18; and, Ron, I'm going to be off the comm here, probably about 4 or 5 minutes.
Okay; understand.
Okay, Ron; I'm back on.
Okay; mighty fine, Stu.
Okay, Stu. It looks like you're getting about ready to maneuver, there. Just want to let you know the LM's in good shape. About the only thing that's even pending is the - their steerable antenna, and it looks like it may not be tracking correctly on the thing. So they may be using their Omni antennas.
Okay.
Okay, thank you, Ron. We'll see you on Omni Delta, here.
Okay. You may see me; I won't see you. We'll hope, maybe it'll work. Hey, by the way, that's a beautiful job whipping around out there - we got some real good selenodetic updates, and I'm sure we got a bunch of good pictures, by golly.
Thank you.
Kitty Hawk, Houston. The APS is pressurized. Antares has a Go for lift-off; direct rendezvous on this pass.
Roger. Thank you, Ron.
Roger.
Okay, turn on Master Arm at 1 minute. You can start the camera. Ten seconds, Abort Stage, push; Engine Arm, Ascent. You give me a Pro at 5 and a 99.
Will do.
And I'm going to push this son of a bitch at plus 1 second anyway. Even if it was Auto ignition- even if it wasn't Auto ignition, it's going to get pushed anyway.
Okay. Yaw right, 30 and then we watch it.
Antares, Kitty Hawk. VHF voice check. How do you read me?
Okay, you'll probably be going to B now to see what we've got.
Hell, it's quiet now. VHF B's quiet.
Okay. I don't know what happened to it. Okay, it's - I think we have not settled. It's still about 6 and a half degrees.
Yes.
Okay, all we have to do is hang on 4 more minutes.
Antares, Houston. Mark at 4 minutes. Stand by.
Antares to Kitty Hawk. VHF check. How do you read?
Mark. Four minutes.
Okay, we're right with you. 240 thousand miles away. Okay, baby, we want you to fire. Ascent Helium, Press 2 is good. Helium 1 is good.
Okay. We're right with you.
Roger. Out.
Well, I can read you somewhat.
And Antares, Kitty Hawk is trying to read you on VHF.
Okay, Guidance, PGNS; Mode Select is in AGS;we're in H and H-do. WE're at Lo Mult; okay, we have computer, we're in PGNS; 25; Prop, Enable; 4 jets; Couples, On; Mode Control three, to Auto. Right on the money. Boy, my visor's so scratched up...
Mine is too.
...when the Sun shines in it, you can't even see...
See a cottonpicking thing. Okay, 3 minutes.
And the light level will decrease soon.
Kitty Hawk, Antares. How do you read?
Read you 3 by, Al. How me?
Antares, Houston. Kitty Hawk is reading you 3 by on VHF.
Roger. We're not reading him.
Okay. We'll pass that to him.
And Antares is counting - counting down to 2 minutes. 3,2,1...
Mark. Two minutes and counting.
We concur.
You son of a bitch. Okay, Audio Mode, both Vox.
Kitty Hawk, Houston. Little less than 2 minutes; everything is Go.
All right, Vox.
Okay, Houston.

There's our boy. Reading you loud and clear. We are 45 seconds and counting.
Roger. I - I've been reading you. You're coming through loud and clear.
Okay, be up to see you shortly.
Okay. Hello.
Roger. I'm waiting.
Okay. DSKYs on time.
Have a nice cool one set up.
Okay. The abort stage is set. Ascent Engine is Armed. 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0...

And you're Go from the ground at 3 and one-half. Everything is nominal.
Okay, Bruce. Looks good here.
Kitty Hawk, Houston. Antares is still Go from the ground.
Roger. Thank you.
Mark. Four.
4,4.
Fire is good.
...Pitch is good.
H-dot is good; H is good, AGS are right together.
Antares, Houston. You're Go from the ground; looking good.
Okay.
Antares, Houston. We show all sources, PGNS, AGS, and MSFN, in good agreement.
That's good.
Okay, thank you. About 225 to go, and the plane looks good.
Looking better. That's good.
Kitty Hawk, Houston. PGNS, AGS and MSFN are all in good agreement.
Now, you can stop your camera, if you want.
Okay. [Garble].
Thank you.
Okay. We're going to be on [garble] at 5:30.
***4:30 to...
Mark IT.

Okay. Let's take one more at 6:30.
All right.
Antares, this is Houston. Trim the PGNS... - -
Let's take a look at 6:30.
That's what you said. Okay.
Right. Take a look at 85 versus 500 for a minute.
...946.
Okay. I'll stay with 500.
Okay. Very good.
You're looking good. There's 800, 750 600, 550, 500. Main valves are Open - -

Better say them again, Al. Minus 0.1, minus 1.4, and hold.
Okay. Pressing on with the checklist.
Okay. WE can go IC***T.
Okay. Inverter - Inverter 2 - I'm on Inverter - -
Antares, Houston. There will be a tweak burn. It'll come up shortly.
Okay.
Roger.
Roger. All right, Inverter 1 circuit breaker, open.
Just a minute. Let me get the - Be sure I got the right attitude. I'm in attitude.
Okay.
Okay. Inverter 1 breaker's open.
Did you get plus or minus 5 Shaft/Trunnion?
Kitty Hawk, Houston. Are you copying the LM VHF?
Affirmative.
Logic Power.
Antares, this is Houston. Tweak TIG 142:36:51. Delta-V: X. minus 2.0; Y, plus 5.0; Z, minu 8.0;and this is it the nominal yaw 30 attitude. Read back. Over.
Roger. 142:36:51. Minus 2.0, plus 5.0, minus 8.0. Okay.
That's affirmative, Ron. I am reading them loud and clear.
Okay. Mighty fine. And, Kitty Hawk; Houston. There will be a tweak burn.
Antares, Houston. Did you copy the tweak burn? Over.
Understand. There will be a tweak.
Affirmative.
That's affirmative, Houston. We're setting up for it now.
Roger. 142:36:51, and minus 2.0, plus 5.0, minus 8.0.
Roger, Ed.
What was that TIG again?
36:51, Al.
Okay. 47's called up.
Getting AGS set up for you. Which axis you gonna do first?
Okay, what's the biggest?
Biggest one is Z - minus Z.
Minus Z is minus 8?
Minus 8.
Okay, we'll do that first.
X, Z, Y, Ed. X, Z, Y. Over.
Do X, Z, Y. Al, they want X, Z, Y.
Okay. 36 what?
51, 20 seconds.
And the first one is X, and that'll be what?
That's minus 2.
Minus 2.0. Minus 2.0?

That looks good. 471 -
That's about - out of plane?
Out of plane is plus 5 right, 2 and a half, 4 and a half; that's great. Right there. Hold it.
Hey, Houston, Tweak's complete.
It's good old P47. Okay. 8.
Roger;out.
Okay.
Okay.
...get in attitude.
Right.
Okay. Well do it in Rate Command. We got plenty of RCS? Yes.
Antares, Houston. You're Go for the APS TPI. APS TPI.
Pardon.
Roger. Thank you.
Okay, Kitty Hawk; Houston. You're Go for a direct rendezvous.
Okay. You're slewing. Okay. When you get just a second - did you get Logic Power circuit breakers open?
Logic Power A's open.
Cabin Fan circuit breaker, closed. Cabin Fan 1-
Wait just a minute, Ed.
Okay.
Antares, Houston. How do you read?
Loud and clear Bruce. I'll lock up for you as soon as we're in position.
Roger. Reading you the same.
Okay. We're about in altitude now. Okay, what are those breakers again?
Okay. Cabin Fan 1.
It's out. Do you want it out or in?
I want it in.
Okay. It's in.
Okay, Houston.
We're locked up on the steerable.
Okay. Rendezvous rate - Rendezvous Radar mode LGC -
Loud and clear, Ed.
Okay...
...Call P20.
20's called.
Verb 80.
Well, we haven't -
Oh - -
- - Locked it yet.
Haven't got it up yet.
No. Searching now.
Kitty Hawk, Houston; we're still checking your vector. You're not ...
Pardon.
I say it's searching now. I don't have a visual.
Okay, I was just going to start on that when I got a Go on it. My- VHF won't stay locked on, Ron. It'll just flash me a Range and then drop right back off again. Anybody got any good ideas?
Okay. We'll give him a tracking light.
Okay, let me check the - You say your VHF won't stay locked on. It locks on and then comes right back out again. Is that correct?
That's affirmative. It just flashes me a Range and then drops right back to zero.
Okay. It's found him. Okay. 000003, we'll take that. We - -
Okay.
Antares, Houston. No state vector updates are required. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
You move your hand a minute, Al?
You. You want a Pro on that?
And Stu reports he's having problems locking on in VHF.
Okay.
You haven't got a 50 18.
Beg your pardon.
You don't get a 50 18.
Not when you're within 10 degrees.
Okay. We'll go to Auto and see what it does.
Am I supposed to have the tape recorder still on?
I don't know.
Should be a turnoff here somewhere. I guess not. Wel'l leave it on. I haven't got anything to do with it but run it out anyhow.
Kitty Hawk, Houston. LM update - or LM state vector update is not required. You're Go the way it is. And any better luck on the VHF?
Okay. Let's get a Verb 80 going. Okay. And call 34.
34. Okay. We can set the - counting down to TPI.
Okay. No, it's still the same.
Okay. Have you got a TIG for me?
Have it in just a second.
Okay.
Kitty Hawk, Houston. I just can't read you.
TIG is 143:10:54, Al.
25 Enter; plus 143 Enter; plus 10 Enter; plus 54.00. Right?
Yes. Let me say it again., 143:10:54.00. That's a good number.
Kitty Hawk, Houston. Transmitting kind of in the blind here, because I can't read you; but go ahead and try to take the VHF monitor, and see if you get a tracking light or not.
Noun 37 is 143:10:54.00.
That's a good number.
Okay, Pro. It might not enter. Okay.
That's affirmative. I do.
Operator Error; okay.
Yes, I got that.
Okay.
Okay. We want a zero, we want a zero, we want a 130. Right?
Okay.
You marked early. Okay. Let's get the COAS on; this is getting ready to go. Okay. What's next?
And, Kitty Hawk; you want to be sure and make sure that the Antares remains quiet on the VHF there while we're trying to lock up on the thing.
Antares, this is Houston. We believe that the Command Module VHF ranging lock problem may be due to the conversation on the loop. Your conversation even over the intercom within the LM is enough to break it up an inhibit lock; so maybe you can get Stu to give you a mark when he's ready to throw the Ranging Reset switch, and then remain silent for about 20 seconds, both spacecraft. Over.
Understand.
Roger. We understand. Give us a call, Stu, when you need it.
Kitty Hawk, Houston. It looks like the VHF may have - may have locked up after your Noun 49 value you had on it.
(garble)
Yes. It's going okay.
Okay, Ed. You got an Orb Rate ball.
Okay.
Okay. Coming up.
You got an Orb Ball.
Okay.
Through?
Are you through with 54?
Yes, I'm through with it.
Antares, this is Houston. We're being informed that all systems are looking good. In particular, BATs 5 and 6 are normal, and you're in good shape trajectory-wise going around the corner. We've got 6 and one-half-minutes to LOS and we anticipate having a ground TPI solution for you prior to LOS. Over.
He said everything's looking good but then he lost us.
Yes, we broke - popped the S-Band Antenna breaker again.
Yes, was just like in the LMS and CMS. I don't see him.
Houston, Antares. I lost my S-Band Antenna breaker again.
Antares, this is Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Antares, Houston. Request Aft Omni and Lo Bit Rate:
Okay.
And you have it.
And it looks like your present attitude is blocking the steerable antenna from pointing at the Earth.
Maybe so, but it also popped a circuit breaker.
Roger. If it runs into the stop, I believe it will.
It didn't. It popped just before it went to the stop.
Roger. Out.
Okay. Range rate, 349, 3 - 000...
Kitty Hawk, Houston. Your vehicle's in good shape. You've got about 5 minutes to LOS here. And, Stu, you're accepting all the optics monitor in good shape. You probably better go ahead and accept the VHF monitor, also.
Okay. It's looking pretty good so far.
Sure is.
Kitty Hawk, Houston.
Sure you're on VHF B, Receive, now?
I'm on B, Receive, yes.
With all that noise?
Go ahead, Houston.
Yes. That's the weird noises that Cernan was talking about.
Okay. Stu, it looks like we're getting some bad VHF spots in there. Just reinitialize the W-matrix and go sextant only - sextant only. So, mark it.
Okay. You say reinitialize? I've already accepted one.
Okay. Eighteen minutes. Should be 20...ECS.
Kitty Hawk, don't worry about the W-matrix on the ground. Just press on. Accept sextant marks only.
It's too late. I've already Initialized it.
Kitty Hawk, Houston. Request Omni Bravo.
Antares, Houston Comm check; over.
Loud and clear, Houston. How me?
Roger. Out.
Core tube stopper.
Yes.
What time's LOS?
Okay; LOS in a couple of minutes.
Okay.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. LM TPI ground solution, Delta-V; X plus 63 feet per second; Y plus 1; Z, plus 67. I say again, LM TPI Delta-V: X, plus 63.0; Y, plus 1.0; Z, plus 67.0. Antares, Over.
Kitty Hawk, Houston. Looks like the best ground solution we have down there for the LM is about as written. It's plus 63.0, plus 1.0, and plus 67.O.
Roger. Copy plus 63, plus 1, plus 67, thank you.
Roger. Out. Ten seconds to LOS. Go get them. See you on the other side, Ed.
Yes, we lost them.
Okay, what's for LOS procedures, Al? You got them there?
Okay. Track Mode Slew; S-Band Antenna, Aft.
Okay.
Set Pitch, plus 114.
Kitty Hawk, Houston. About 30 seconds; you're looking good. We'll see you on the other side.
Okay.
Yaw, minus 46.
Okay.
Biomed, Off.
Biomed, Off.
PCM, Lo.
PCM is Lo.
Uplink Squelch, Enable.
Okay. It's Enable.
Anyway, I didn't make the...pullouts.
Isn't this supposed to be cut - cut through?
Is it?
Yes.
It's not. See how I can slide it back and forth?
There he is.
Find him?
Yes. There's sunlight on him.
Give me a Verb 82. Let's see how we agree.
Looks just like a star.
Ooh I'd like to get these helmet and gloves off.
You want to take them of?
What?
Want to take them off?
Yes I'd like to (laughter) There's no crap in the cat - in the cockpit.
8.65 by 50.9.
Okay. I've got 50.3 by 4 - let's see, 403; 8.4, so that's - we're right together Al.
Okay. And it looks good, babe.
Good solutions.
Looks good. Oh I'm sorry - It's not him - it is not he. Thought he was moving, but he's not - just - don't see him at all.
Verb 62.
Glad we're not doing this visually.
4.1.
Everything's looking good. Everything's quiet.
Okay. I'm going to retarget PGNS here, I mean AGS here. 514, 00000, 515. Move your hand a bit. There's the problem. Plus 4 all zeros, 516, plus 00000. Enter.
Okay.
Okay. Everything's going very nicely.
Sounded like Stu went off the air.
Yes, it sure does.
Thought he was starting to - took a Reset Ranging set.
Oh yes,...any good.
...2,4, 42....
Sure are noisy.
Okay. I'm ready to - How about that - there's no use in being this miserable. Do you want to break helmets and gloves?
Well, we'll - we can put them on just before docking, can't we?
We can.
The only thing is we'll have a different configuration on the Cabins.
What we need to do is go Cabin, Cabin.
Well, Auto on both, Cabin Gas Return.
Auto on both of those.
Is Cabin holding?
I don't see any flow;it had been holding. It hadn't moved.
Okay.
Okay, Antares, I ... maneuver.
Okay, Stu.
Okay. We're in final Comp, 34.
Okay.
Okay. You want to copy down the solution?
Yes. Just a second here.
You're going to have a transfer angle of 30 degrees.
Okay. Let's have a solution, Noun 55. I don't need -
Begin transferring with 30 degrees.
Just a minute. Let me write it down. Okay, you have 30.
30.16.
AGS says 29.86.
Good show.
You'll have to move those four to burn because they'll end up down there. Okay, Noun 58 - are 446...
885, 287.
885, 287. All right.
Okay. Here we go. 81 - boy, it's close to the ground.
621, plus 1, plus 631. That's pretty close to what - they gave us from the ground.
It really is.
Okay, Stu, did you read our Noun 81?
Say again?
Did you read our Noun 81?
Okay. We had 62 - plus 62 1, plus 0,1, plus 63 1, and I'll take yours.
(garble)
Okay.
Getting pretty good on that sextant, huh?
Yes ...
That's affirm. We have VHF Ranging on A and Receive on B.
Do you want 59?
No, I don't care,
Okay. I'm going to call up 42.
Pardon? Okay,
Calling up 42,
Okay. Our solutions are good enough. We'll go - go with your PGNS, Al,
Okay. Let me just change the adapter up in here.
Stu? Stu, we're going to burn plus 62.1, plus 0.1, plus 63.1,
Okay, I copy.
Okay. Going to burn attitude. It's only 2 degrees off.
Okay, we're sitting in burn attitude.
Can you get the checklist while I finish targeting AGS?
Sure.
Okay. I need Verb 16. Could be Noun 86 is - Okay. 450, plus 00621, Enter; 451, plus - 452, plus 00631, Enter.
Okay, Stu. We're in burn attitude. Looks like we're going to make the burn all right.
Okay.
Okay. You through with -
Okay. I'm through with those. You can have them.
Okay. Counting down at 40. You want to check your Display/Engine Override/Logic, closed; and Descent Engine Override, open.
Okay. What was the closed one?
Display./Engine Override/Logic.
Okay, it's closed. Descent Engine Override, open - -
Okay.
- - is open.
Rate Scale, 25; 4 Jets - -
Okay. Let's get these helmets down.
Balance Couples, On. Deadband, Min... Abort Stage, reset; Mode Control, three, PGNS, Auto, AGS, Auto, reset, reset.
I had to put it on to get rid of it.
Now, mine will be okay,
Yes, yours is all right.
Okay. One minute 56 seconds to go. You had a 400 plus 10000?
400 and plus 10000.
Okay. Okay. Okay. To end, I'm going to put the Abort - set the Abort Stage, start manual ullage, and I want you to Pro at 5.
Okay.
Okay. At ignition, if no ignition?
Engine Arm, Ascent; Manual Start, Manual Stop in 3 seconds.
Okay. You should have an Engine Arm, Ascent before you get there, or somewhere.
Well ... see, you're not - you're not only arming with the abort stage; if you don't get it, go Engine Arm, Ascent.
Okay.
And on and off.
Okay. 1 minute. AGS, Mode Control.
Okay.
Okay. DSKYs on time.
Okay. Abort Stage set. Starting ullage. 6, 5, 4, -
Pro
3, 2, 1, We have -
Ignition. 31, shutoff.
Man!
Okay. We made the burn.
Okay. Sounds like you got a good burn,
Boy, that's a wild ride, Stuart.
I've been told ...
Yes, we're trimming now.
Beautiful, Al; 0, 0, and 3. Let me write them down.
Okay; 0, 0, plus 0,1.
Okay, you got them; 0, 0, plus 0.1. AGS is plus 0.2, 501, minus 0.5, 502 plus 0.4. Good burn. Good burn.
Okay, Ed. Engine stop, reset. Now ve ought to get back into Auto Track.
That's affirm. We should be in it.
Okay.
Radar needles are off.
Pardon. Say, you got a 50 18 to take you back.
Okay. Just got a - I just - just came up - there you go.
Okay. We are back in attitude, and we're in good shape.
So I just need to see the checklist.... That's alright. 1905 and 15, 2059,372 - ....
Antares, Kitty Hawk,
Go ahead.
Hey, I was wondering if I could get, say, 20 seconds; see if I could get the VHF locked up?
Sure.
Say when you need it.
Give us a mark. We'll be quiet for 20 seconds.
Okay, 3, 2, 1 -
Mark.
Okay, Ed. I got - I got a hunch that's it. We're 26 now.
Right on. We say 26. That's pretty good.
Well I...what...
Verb 67 is in, loaded.
Yes, every time you get a reset, Stu, give us a yell.
Okay.
We won't know unless you tell us.
Okay. How's your AGS doing over there?
Man, it's just staying right in there. Just hanging in pretty as can be.
Say, Stu. They tell us from Houston, now, they want us to plus-X thrust anyway on the first docking attempt. You get that word from them?
