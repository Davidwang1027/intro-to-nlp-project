Open.
Emergency Cabin Press, select closed.
Close.
Okay. Here, let me get you started on your optics.
Can I borrow that back again? Oh, there she be.
Okay. Ready for your optics, Stuart?
No, not quite yet. Let me get my handholds down here, so...
Okay. Well, holler when you're ready, and I'll come back to you.
Well, I'm a little behind on...
No, we're not really...
Carnarvon LOS, now. Okay, Service Module RCS monitor check. I've got all eight of them gray. Okay. 115 to 140 75. That all looks good. Helium Press...
Okay.
Thank you.
42.
Okay. Can I help you with anything now?
You can read the helium pressures - I'll - I'll get those. I just thought that...
On the quads?
Yes.
Okay. You on B, now?
Now, why did they put those that way?
Yes.
Okay. And you want...
4000.
quantity's 100 and full scale high and tank temp is 74.
Okay.
You got tank temp down there?
Okay...
For -...
Let me just get the pressures and then the tanks and the quantities, because I have to copy them all down.
41.
Helium, 41 on C.
Okay.
41 on B. Now, what do you need?
Okay. That's helium - I need manifold Press.
Okay. Manifold pressure is 200 on D...
Okay.
200 on C.
Okay.
200 on B.
Okay.
And 200 on A.
Very good.
Okay. Helium tank temp - I need to record.
Okay. Tank temp's on A at 75.
75.
B is 72; C is 81; and D is 77.
Okay. Propellant quantity.
B, full scale high...
Okay.
C, full scale high; D is full scale high; A is full scale high. That baby had a full load.
Okay. Okay, Command Module RCS monitoring. Talkback, gray.
I'll get the cameras in a little bit.
Yes. Okay, we're in no hurry...
I'm going to read my optics dust cover jettison.
Okay.
Yes. We didn't have to worry about the cameras before.
60, 90. 60, 90.
Yes.
That looks good...
Okay. Install optics eyepieces and handles...
41 to 42...
that's done. G/N Power, Optics, on (up).
Manifold Press 81 to 105. That's good. Those are good. Okay. Secondary radiator leak check.
Optics Zero, Off.
quantity...
Optics Zero, Zero.
Al, could I have the Secondary Glycol to Radiator valve...
Optics Mode, Man.
Normal for 30 seconds and then Bypass.
Optics Coupling Direct; Optics Speed control, Hi.
Okay.
Okay. That'll be 15 seconds. Okay, let's see if we've got the monitor. Optics hand control, okay, is Manual, Hi, Direct, and going max right. Going about 40 degrees. And this one ought to go about 150.
Man! It looks - It's pure black. Can't see because I'm not adapted. lens cover. And you need to.
Did you get all of your jettison - optics dust cover jettison checklist, Stu?
Yes, I did.
Okay. G/N Optics, on. Optics Zero, Off.
Yes.
Zero for 15.
That's verified.
Optics Zero, Off. Optics Mode, Manual then.
That's verified.
Coupling control, Direct, and Hi Speed - Speed control, Hi, and max right until ejected.
That's verified.
Okay.
Okay, Ed. You want to go from Normal to Bypass, now?
Yes, for 30 seconds.
Okay, here it is right now..
Okay, I got it.
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Something's wrong here..
No. No. I wanted Secondary Glycol to Radiator valve for Normal. Secondary Glycol.
Okay. Glycol, Secondary Radiator valve - I can't see that mother.
Man! Those stars are dimmer than they are in the simulator.
Is our - light in here bothering you, Stuart?
No. No, I - I've got them.
Okay, Ed. I think I've got it now.
Okay. You've got her in Bypass, huh?
No, wait a minute. God damn it! I just cannot feel it.
Yes.
I can't feel it. The simulator's got a big red stripe on it. Maybe if I get my little finger in there, I can line it up.
Okay. Start with star 22 for the first one, if you've got a chance to write it...
Okay. Star 22.
Okay.
The other will be star 24.
And the other will be star 24.
Yes. Gienah. Oh, I.
Okay, Al. It's in Bypass, huh?
You want it in Bypass?
I'm sorry. I want it in Normal for 30 seconds.
It's in Normal. Has been for - 10 seconds. I'll.
Okay. I'm just watching the - quantity there.
Okay, that's about 30 seconds.
It looks good. We have no leaks.
Okay, back in Bypass.
Okay. I'm ready to set a configuration here. I need the Glycol Reservoir Bypass valve to Open.
Okay. Stand by 1. Glyc Bypass valve, Open.
Out valve, Closed; In valve, Closed.
Out valve, Closed; In valve, Closed.
Okay. And we want to fill the Primary Accumulators.
Oh, shit!
What?
Oh, I got four balls.
Oh, God. Too bad.
What did he get, four balls 1?
Yes. He got a 1.
Oh, hell.
Too bad, babe.
I'm tempted to repeat it. I think I will.
Okay.
Okay.
You want the Primary Accumulator Fill, huh?
Yes, please.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay, Ed. Here it comes. It's On.
All right, it's on. Okay. Okay, you can shut it off. I've got almost 60 percent.
Okay, it's Off.
Okay. Okay, ECS Radiator, Flow - Flow Control to Power. Power. Primary Glycol to Radiator valve, Normal, push.
Okay, down she goes.
ECS Radiator Heater, Prim 1.
Hear it? Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle.
Yes, and there she came. I saw it.
(Laughter) Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle. Okay.
Okay. We want to watch ECS Rad Temp Prim Out below Prim In. It's below Prim In. It's looking good already. ECS talkback, gray. Glycol Evap Temp In to Auto.
There we go.
There you go, babe.
Got a four ball.
Yes, he did.
Son of a bitch. Got five balls.
Good show. We won't count the first one.
No. Okay. With 22, 24, five balls.
Okay.
And there's a Noun 93.
Okay.
You want to copy them?
Yes, I'm copying them. 89...
00085.
8 5?
Right.
Sorry.
And second - R2 is plus 00010; R3...
10?
Right. R3 is plus 00166.
Okay, and let's say it's 38:15.
1. 38.
15.
Right.
Torque.
15.
Torque at 38:15.
Okay. Optics - Now, that - if - I stow the eyepieces, don't I?
Stow optics eyepieces.
Yes.
That's affirm.
Optics Zero to Zero.
And if we torqued, we should realign the GDC...
Okay. Now - Yes, just a minute. Go Optics Zero after we get them down to a certain angle, right?
Yes, I'm going to try to do that. It's really not part of our operation, but you can't go wrong doing it.
I'm - I'm going to bring the purge on. We'll get a Master Alarm.
Okay. Ball 1 Att set, IMU. Roll was about - 180. Fuel cell 2, okay. And the yaw is set about - that much and the pitch is way over at 220.
Okay. Fuel cell purge is complete.
Okay. Does it call for me to turn the Optics - G/N Optics Power, Off?
16.
Here, I should get out my checklist..
Optics - Let's see. No, I don't see that. It says P00...
Reticle...
Reticle Brightness, dim.
Okay. Stow optics eyepieces and increase S-band volume. I never decreased it. You know, we don't have any - We have Squelch, Enable?
That's affirm.
Okay. You can tell it, can't you?
Sure can.
Okay. Well, ha ha. That's the way I wanted to start it. Five balls. Next thing on the agenda is that decal up there.
Okay, Ed. The GDC's aligned.
All right.
Okay.
Okay, Stu, to P00. Okay. Press is okay. O2 Press...
Got a full load of RCS fuel for you.
That's right. We'll use it to burn. quiet.
Yes. Let's take is easy on that stuff. Just tap it like it's forever. Son of a bitch! That booster was good, wasn't it?
Oh, that's something else!
Yes, wasn't it, though? O2 quantity...
Now that book wants to set there. For Pete - Do you have trouble wanting to go to the...
Yes. I keep floating up in...
Yes. That's...
I do, too. I have a hell of a job holding myself down for shooting the optics.
Yes. Boy, those stars are...
Real good.
crystal clear.
Roger. It just has to be Orb Rate. Sixty-one percent.
And I got a real bright one we're aimed for right now.
Boy, they're not near as bright in that telescope as they are in the simulator.
Well, you're probably not adapted yet.
Yes. Yes. I got down here with these floodlights flaring out...
Yes.
After I turned them out, I could see Gienah through it the second time around, so I was adapting. Okay. Looks like all I need to do is the - is to get out the stowage bag...
Got a good horizon out here.
Dark?
Yes.
You can see it, huh?
Uh-huh.
You need anything else out of me, Ed? How you coming.
No. No. I don't need anything else out of you right now, Stu.
Well, I'm seeing it I'm seeing airglow, Stu. I can see the stars on the other side of it.
Well, I tell you what. Why don't I get out those temporary stowage bags, and then I can get the cameras out at our convenience, if that's agreeable.
I'm ready for it. You can hand me mine right now.
Well, I've got to go down and get it first.
Okay. Yes. That's airglow I can see, because I can see the stars underneath it.
Man, that booster's something. Couldn't get over the ice. That was something when the ice came off.
Yes, that really was.
I expected more vibration.
I really did, too.
I was really...
Yes, I thought that was a real smooth ride. Real smooth. Okay. Let's keep pressing ahead here. Slowly but surely. How you doing, Ed?
Okay. Proceeding through my systems check.
I got a bag coming up your side there. Oop! Hey, another one got away - the other two are up behind your head. Can you reach them?
Who, me?
Yes (laughter).
Yes, I'll get them.
Hey, good (laughter). Thank you, babe. Guess what I found in there.
Oh, those goddamn things are going to be all over the place, You were right what you said about Dell'Osso.
Yes. I was needling Gene. I knew they'd done that. I mean, I didn't know it but I sus - Right behind your head are two more of those bags, Al, if you could reach them.
Okay. I'll get them. We're probably going to be collecting those patches the rest of the flight.
Yes, they're going to be hiding everywhere.
Okay, Ed-babe. How about a temporary stowage bag?
All right. I'll take one.
And, Stu-babe. How about a temporary stowage bag?
I'll take one.
Take it away. isn't this great?
Isn't this marvelous?
Son of a bitch! I tell you. I've already beat my old record.
You beat your old record at insertion! (Laughter)
(Laughter) I know it. I was just kidding.
Okay.
And, in here, you'll have to make sure you get the bottom one snapped, which you have not had to do in the...
37 5.
in the CMS.
Yes. We've done at your insistence. At your insistence, we have done it, and it's now completed here.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's see. We're on 4-Bravo on the test meter, and it's reading 37.
Okay, now what?
Okay. I'm ready to do an ECS monitoring check. Suit Pressure - Delta-P is okay.
(Laughter) How are you doing down there,?
O2 flow.
Five balls. That's the way I wanted to start. The next thing on the agenda is that fucking decal up there. 32.5.
Okay. Well, we'll...
We'll work on that one.
We'll get to that.
If I start hosing it out, you just say something.
I'll say something. Don't you worry. Don't you worry, babe.
There's another one.
Okay...
Okay.
We're in the green on Repress package.
Well, we'll have plenty of them to give out. Yes. We ought to save them for all the hookers in Titusville (laughter).
Huh? He said we could either carry them gracefully or otherwise.
Yes. No. I'm going to give them to all the hookers in Titusville.
Let's see. You might get out your bracket for the camera, if you're out of things to do, Al, and I'll be handling the camera, shortly.
Okay. Okeydokey.
(Whistling)
I was going to reach for the G&C Dictionary (laughter ).
Yes. We got to treat this with a little care because it might just come out of there like everything else does.
Stu?
Huh?
Can you - reach over there and unsnap one of those - unsnap one of those hose lines?
Yes. Yes, I certainly can.
Because we don't want to wipe out - Thank you. Thank you. That's the dimension I need.
Oh, Jesus. There's one in here, too. There must be one in every frigging volume - stowage that we have.
Probably.
I think there's going to be.
Yes, they knew. God damn, they knew we've got to get into all these things.
Okay.
Hey, Ed, let me give a presento.
Okay. Just 1 sec.
Doot doot dum.
Here's something - Okay. If you could take a camera. Here's something, you know, we never check in any of the bench checks - that was this 10-millimeter lens won't stay in the - in the cushion. It just floats right on out.
Yes. Look at that camera.
Getting a little leverage here.
I'll - I'll drop your seatbands in just a second there.
Let her go, babe. Ooooh.
Okay. Okay. I'm down in the checklist to where - We've already done to GDC Align; we will unstow the sequence camera bracket and the ORDEAL. Have you mounted the ORDEAL box?
You haven't told me to, yet.
Okay, you can do that as soon as you get your sequence camera under hand there, while I start doing the secondary glycol loop check. Secondary - Secondary Cool Loop pump, AC 1. And I heard it come on.
Just for on the tape, for DSE purposes, the 10-millimeter lens and 75-millimeter lens will not stay in the cushion.
Okay. That's surprising. They were kind of tight before, weren't they?
Yes.
Okay. What's the last set here on this thing?
I guess we've got a gray tape. Don't we...
What, you want it set on it, Al?
Yes.
Oh.
I'll - I'll give it to him. I've got it right here. Okay. You want T8.
T8, set.
250th.
And a 250th is set.
Seven feet.
Seven feet is set.
And 12 frames per second.
And 12 frames per second. Okay.
Okay.
(Whistling)
Oh, sunrise, troops.
Oh, mag...
Son of a bitch!
Oh, gah!
Son of a bitch! I missed that, and I could've been up there, too.
Well, put that thing up.
Oh, hurry. It's not too late.
Look right here. Look right through the hatch.
I can't get the - All I can see is darkness.
Well...
It's down that way; come up...
Yes, just a second. Here, let me fix my couch.
You really ought to get it, babe. Beautiful. It is beautiful!
That is really great. Sun comes up like thunder.
Apollo 14, Houston through Carnarvon. How do you read?
We read you loud and clear.
Roger. We're reading you a lot of background static.
Houston, are you ready for our IMU REFSMMAT realign check, P52 numbers?
Roger, Ed. Go ahead.
That's Noun 71s are 22, 24; Noun 05 is all balls; Noun 93, plus 00.085, plus 00.010, plus 00.166; GET of 38:15. And we just burst into sunlight, Gordo. It was quite a sunrise.
Roger, Ed. We copy that.
Apollo 14, through Honeysuckle. Over.
Apollo 14, Houston through Honeysuckle. If you read, go omni Charlie.
But you know, you get down there, you're not adapted at all. And I'd been looking at the bright Sun; and then, I look out there. I couldn't see a thing in - in this damn thing.
Yes, you must admit we sinking feeling. Well, I was sure they were gone, because I swore I felt them go.
Okay. We're going to talk to the States, here, in a few minutes. What are we going to do, since we're ahead a little bit, what do we do...
Let me get out - while he's - I'll get out checklist here, while you're...
Kind of look ahead and see what's next.
Yes. Yes, we've got all the cameras up.
(Laughter). Do you want to use this place up here for them?
Yes, that'd be good for it.
Okay. As a matter of fact, those rascals aren't bad.
You know, those are really good work on those.
Good workmanship, yes.
Shouldn't have that on the tape either.
What does that say down there? Rock of Gibraltar? Take a closer look at that.
You did do the SCS attitude reference check?
Yes, I got it written down.
Okay. Now, the next thing we got coming up is the docking probe; and then, we get a TLI PAD; and then, we start into TLI Prep, 1 plus.
Yes. I've got our TV camera running over here.
Do you have the - an image on the monitor?
Uh-huh. Got the corner of the world poking out there.
You want to put the monitor up here and can we...
start to feel a little hungry.
I am, too.
I'm glad we decided to put those sandwiches in there.
Wonder what we got.
Well, after all, it is 5:25, Cape time.
I must admit I got a tinge of glumness there when they called that hold. I was really primed for 3:23.
Yes, I was, too. I agree.
I can't really blame them though.
No, they got a - You know, you get bit once, you - you can't afford to - There's a lot of water down there. Ought to be able to coming up here.
Well, are we going to have any lunch? What do you want?
28.
20 degrees of angle.
(Whistling)
Well, let's see, get a little time here. Let's take a look at this COAS. Put it on the horizon and see what it reads.
(Groan)
Pull this out of here.
Yes, just push me around if I'm in your way.
14, 14. 14 and a half. Whoops!
Would you like to see out my window, guys?
Look at that. Good picture.
Now, if you want to hold it, let me see if I can peak it up here. It drifted away from me is the reason I - f/44, brighten it up. Okay. I think f/44 is what I want.
Pretty good.
(Cough)
resolution, haven't we?
Yes.
At least the black-and-white does.
I'm looking to the north, aren't I - as we're going along?
You better be.
You - you - straight out that window is not too far off the track, I mean, you know...
Straight out this window?
Yes, you know...
Oh...
You can almost see the nadir out that window. Oh, - you're, - oh, - well, I didn't realize you were down on that window.
Well, I was looking out...
You're - both...
of both of them.
windows on your side.
Yes, out this one.
You know, I can't believe how clean that this spacecraft is.
I haven't seen a single bolt...
Okay. Let me have that a minute, Stu.
The only thing cluttering it up are the backup patches.
Hold the cabin just a second, Stu. Let me see if I can anchor this monitor any better.
Okay. Yes, it - it's set up on that Velcro. It - it should seat where you...
Well, it seems to be. I keep kicking it off. Here, let me...
Need a little more cord there.
That's all I - that's all I need is a little more cord.
Yes. In lunar orbit, I'm going to be swamped with cord and cable.
What's that?
There's more badges (laughter).
Okay, I got it.
I'll get it out of the way I'm over here. beep, beep, beep all over the place.
He who laughs last.
Well I'm - even so, I'm hell of a lot happier that we're flying and looking at their patches, rather than the other way around.
Well, That's what I meant by laughing last (laughter ).
Yes. It's really a strange feeling. You know, sitting here looking out, it's hard to tell whether you're standing on your head, or...
Yes, I'm just - I'm still just a bit disoriented.
Are you?
Well, I'm not when I look out the window, but I'm still - I'm a little bit disoriented in direction.
Well, I think the only aloof feeling you have is just the fact that you're stuffy feeling in your head.
Yes.
if I thought you could things looking so.
What you got going for you there, Leader?
Huh?
What you got going for you there?
Oh, I was just - you know - looking around; see if I can get disoriented..
Oh. It sounds like...
Up is up, and down is down.
No sweat!
Sure am anxious to get this thing burning again.
Yes. Yes. I tell you, I'd be a little bit nervous about the, the way that baby put us in orbit!
Yes. How's our tanks going? I guess we ought to take a look at those over here.
35 - 35, oxidizer; and 20, fuel. Right where it was when she cut off.
Well, I guess I'd better put this back until we get to Houston, here, in a minute.
Well, we're 01:28:46, now. My checklist says US LOS - Oh, okay. LOS, sorry about that..
That shouldn't change.
Yes. We ought to have them.
Ought to be fairly close.
There, we just - we just got a wiggle on - yes...
Here it comes.
It's not worth shit.
No. It's not very good.
There, it's coming up.
Okay.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 14. How do you read?
coastline I - I can see it,
Ah, there it is. Yes. See? That's Baja.
Yes.
Yes?
Hello, Houston; Apollo 14. How do you read?
Apollo 14, this is Houston. You're loud and clear, Ed.
Where is it? I can't see it.
I - I'm not sure it is - I can't - I've got a...
Apollo 14, Houston. You're loud and clear. Go ahead.
Roger, Houston. We've completed our checklist up to page.
14, Houston. We started getting - pretty bad static right in the middle of that transmission. Will you say again?
Roger, Houston. We have completed our L2-18.
Roger.
Houston, we're starting to extend the docking probe now.
Roger, Ed. And I have a TLI plus 90 PAD any time you're ready to copy.
Roger. One second and I'll be ready for you.
Okay, Houston, the probe's extended.
Houston, I'm ready to copy.
Okay, Ed. One question from Dr. Gilruth. They're wondering how y'all like zero g.
Say again, Houston.
Dr. Gilruth was wondering how you like to fly - how you like flight in zero g...
I think I got that one, Gordon. You're asking about zero g and it's - it's really great. Everybody's in great shape, we're having a ball, well ahead of the timeline.
Roger, I'll go ahead with TLI plus 90, Ed, if you're ready.
Go ahead.
Okay, it's a TLI plus 90, SPS/G&N. Noun 47, 64470; minus 1.45, plus 1.30; TIG is 003:59:51.13; Noun 81, minus 0515.8, plus all balls, plus 8420.6; attitude, 181, 256, 001; HA is NA; HP, plus 0017.1; 8436.4, 9:01, 8404.9; sextant star, 15; 221.4, 39.9; boresight star is NA; Noun 61, minus 30.14, minus 025.00; 1154.4, 33721; GET for.05g, 012 - correction - 010:57:29. GDC Align set stars are Sirius and Rigel; 333, 083, 013; no ullage. Go ahead.
Roger, Houston. That comm wasn't too good. I missed burn time, trunnion angle, and Please repeat those two.
Roger. Your burn time is 9:01 and trunnion angle, 39.9. Over.
Roger. And say again the burn time.
Burn time 9:01, 9:01. Over.
Roger; 9:01. TLI plus 90, SPS/G&N. 64470, minus 1.45, plus 1.30; at 003:59:51.13; 515.8, plus all zeros, plus 8420.6, 181, 256, 001; NA; plus 0017.1; 8436.4, 9:01, 8404.9; 15; 221.4, 29.9; NA; Noun 61, minus 30.14, minus 025.00; 1154.4; 33721; GET of.05g, 010:57:29; Sirius, Rigel; 332, 082, 013; no ullage.
Okay, Ed. I have about four corrections. The first is on Delta-VX on Noun 81. I missed your readback on that. It should be minus 0515.8. Is that what you got?
That's affirm; 0515.8.
Okay; a couple of read-backs were incorrect. Trunnion angle is 39.9, 39.9. Over.
Roger; trunnion, 39.9.
And on R-aligns, or the GDC align, that is 333, and pitch is 083. Yaw you read back correctly, 013. Over.
Roger; 333, 083, and you're coming in very loud and clear now, Gordon.
Okay, Ed. You've been loud and clear. I'll give you the P37 for Lift-off plus 8, if you're ready.
Go ahead.
Okay, GET of ignition is 008:00, 3283, minus 165, and GET for 400K, 045:38. Go ahead.
That's 008:00, 3283, minus 165, and 045:38.
Roger, your readback's correct, and I have the TLI PAD.
Okay, these PADs are sure wrecking my viewing, but all right.
Okay, Houston, go ahead with the TLI PAD.
14, Houston. Before the PAD, would you give us P00 and Accept for a new state vector?
Okay, you have it.
And I'm ready with the TLI PAD.
Go ahead.
Roger; time base 6 predict; 2:18:51; attitude for TLI, 179, 136, 000; burn time, 5:52; 10363.0; 35549; Sep attitude, 359, 168, 319; extraction attitude, 301, 348, 041; ejection time is 3:56:00. Go ahead.
Okay. I have 02:18:51. I missed the angles; burn time, 5 plus 52; 10363.0, 35549; 359, 168, 319; 301, 348, 041; ejection, 3:56:00. And would you give me the angles again, please?
Roger, Al. Your readback was correct. The TLI attitude is 179, 136, 000. Go ahead.
I have 179, 136, 000.
Roger. Readback correct.
Apollo 14, Houston. The computer's yours. We're through with the uplink.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay, Houston. We're going to stand by for your Go for pyro arm.
Roger, Al. Stand by.
You're Go for pyro arm now.
Okay, Houston. Our Logic switches are on.
Roger. Now you're Go for pyro arm.
Thank you.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead.
We have about 4 minutes to LOS Vanguard, Ed. And, due to the launch delay, the Canary pass will be pretty low elevation, marginal; at the most, about 2 minutes long.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead.
We're reading the CDR's EKG loud and clear now. We're wondering if you did anything to fix it up there.
Nope.
Roger. It looks good.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger; we're real close to LOS. I'll go ahead and give you the words I've got about TLI. First of all, the - the monitor angles on page L2-24 should all be increased by 2.5 degrees. And, if you're monitoring the TLI burn with the cue card, the pitch angles should all be reading about 9 degrees higher than on the card. The yaw should be within a quarter degree, one-fourth degree of what the card reads. Did you copy? Over.
Apollo 14, Houston through Canaries. Over.
Okay, Houston. We got nothing of your last transmission. You dropped off the air.
Okay, Ed. I'll start over. For the TLI - coming up on your monitor - First of all on the cue card, the yaw angles as shown are okay. The pitch that you see on the ball should be 9 degrees higher all the way through the burn than as shown on the cue card; just add 9 to all your pitch angles and that should be good. On the ORDEAL angles that - is shown on pages 2-24 and 25, increase each of those by 2 and a half degrees. At 57 minutes, instead of 18, you should have 20.5 degrees; at 59 minutes, 12.5; and at 59:55, 8.5 degrees. Over.
Roger; understand that the yaw angles are okay. Pitch should be - angle should be plus 9 degrees and ORDEAL angles increased by 2.5 degrees.
Roger. That pitch is a 9-degree increment over what is shown on the card. In other words, all the angles should be 9 degrees higher than as shown on the card - the inertial angles. Over.
Roger; got you, Gordon. We got that. We're with you.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
On your P15, we show that you loaded the wrong seconds figure for time base 6. Will you check it?
Thank you, Gordon. Good call.
1805100. There you are. Okay. Okay, now I'll discard - this plus 2.5 degrees in depth?
That's right. It goes to 20.5.
20.5. And this is going to become 12.5.
12.5.
And this, then, becomes 8.5...
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
For that time to take, you're going to have to reselect P15.
Roger. I - I did, Gordon. We'll run through it again.
Roger.
Okay. We need to be pressing along here.
Okay, press.
set Delta-VC.
Just a second. If you want to note that during the venting of the Delta-V test - And, under the second vent, that was minus 99.5. Okay.
Minus 95.5.
99.5.
Got it.
Okay, I'm setting...
Two hours 18 and 51 seconds. 37.
(Whistling)
I need to get a hack on that 2:18:51...
2:18:51.
Okay, it's coming up toward 51 - Should be coming toward 55:51; that would be 5 - 23 minutes. Okay. 1...
Hack. Okay?
All right.
(Whistling)
Okay, your number - have you got it?
103 something. 10363.0.
Okay.
I keep being afraid, like in the simulator, to let go of my book; it's going to fall down on the...
Yes,. That's what you get for not paying attention to what you're doing.
Right.
around.
(Cough)
Okay, Delta-VC, 10363.0...
63.0. That's correct.
Stand by, Delta-V. Okay?
Okay.
Now, GDC Align; okay
That's the next thing. Now first, EMS Function, Delta-V.
Okay, so it is.
GDC Align.
Okay. In work, my friend.
And, Stu, check your DAP, if you haven't already.
All right....
Verb 48.
Okay, I have 31102.
Okay, zero, all ones.
Zero and all ones.
Call Verb 83.
back there on the - There.
Okay. We're setting our ORDEAL at 100/Earth.
I want to be sure that GDC is right on the money. Within a quarter of a degree. Okay, that's close enough. Okay. GDC's aligned, Ed.
Okay. Set ORDEAL to 100/Earth.
Okay. We want Earth power. We want 100. That's what we have. Okay.
And it says we can arm the pyros here.
Is that time correlated at all or is the...
Yes, it says here that we have - It's right after LOS at Carnarvon at 1:55, and we're 3 minutes - 4 minutes after that..
Canary time?
I mean Canaries time.
All righty.
SECS Pyro, two - SECS Pyro Arm, two, on (up).
Okay, all I do with the ORDEAL at this time is set Earth power in 100 and hold that.
That's right.
That's where it is. Okay.
Why don't you slew it in - Well, see, you call a Verb 83. It says you set ORDEAL, so...
Pyro A, on; Pyro B...
Oh, okay.
on.
Yes, you really want to set the ORDEAL up on Verb 83.
Okay. Okay, so we'll select ball 1 to Orb Rate and we will hold it back; then we'll slew up to 1.0. Okay, ORDEAL's running at 1.5. Operating Slow, Earth/100. Okay.
Okay. And standing by for pyro arm.
The pyros have been armed.
Okay, Translational Control Power, on.
It's on.
Rotational Control Power, Normal, two, AC/DC, verify.
Okay. Normal, two, AC/DC, verify.
Rot Control Power Direct, two, Main A/Main B.
Direct 1, Main A/Main B; Direct 2, Main A/Main B.
Launch Vehicle Indicator, GPI - S-II/S-IVB, verify.
Okay. GPI is in S-II/S-IVB. And that's - The pressures are real quiet down here.
Okay.
We've got to remember to watch those babies after shutdown, too.
Okay. Circuit breaker Direct Ullage, two, closed.
Okay, two Ullage breakers going closed.
And I'm cycling the cryo fans.
Okay,.
gone to Auto?
Huh?
No.
No..
Set the DET at 51.
Okay. see how close that baby is before we -.
What have you got.
1 minute. 17, 18, 19, 20. Hey, it stayed right in there, didn't it? Two hours; no appreciable error. Enter. Reset.
DET is set at 51:00.
Okay. And Stu has lunar time base 6.
Yes, I was looking at Noun 20 there.
Okay. Verify you've done that.
Okay, Control is coming up. It's locked.
Time base 6 is at 2:18. And we have 16 minutes to stand by.
up here.
Okay.
Stand by, in case we just have to.
No, God damn it! That's the way we play it.
Well, standing by.
Okay.
That's what the damn thing's there for.
We want to think positive.
Who's supposed to do that?
Think positive and prepare for the worst.
Okay. Tell me, how - Where do we stand now with respect to sunlight. We shouldn't get sunlight prior to...
Sunrise is...
2:21.
Well, 2:21 on the old time line.
It's going to be earlier.
Yes, a little bit earlier.
It's going to be earlier because sunset was a little early. We have three - three-quarters of an hour - 15 degrees.
Did we really get off at 03? Is that about what it was?
Yes. See - It looks like they programed us for 40-minutes-late lift-off and that's what we have.
Exactly 40, huh?
Uh-huh.
Good show.
Temperature in the 52.
You know, I been getting light flashes with my eyes open.
(Laughter)
I think you should when you see lightning down there. Ed and I saw some when you were copying that TLI PAD.
Is that what it is?
Yes.
Okay. I see a forest fire down there.
Do you?
were over?
We were over Africa at the start...
We're over deepest, darkest Africa.
Say hello to all the troops at Mozambique. Hello, troops in Mozambique.
Okay...
reset the...
Damn, except for the - the dynamics during launch, it seemed like a Sim, you know it?
Uh-huh.
Sitting here, quiet. The visual's a little better.
This seems to be a light flashing by..
(Humming - "Give My Regards to Broadway")
You shouldn't be rolling.
Huh?
You shouldn't be rolling.
Now, I see something to do here.
Yes, I'm going to go back - and make sure we haven't missed a single thing.
I got the G&N Dictionary down here. All out, ready to read.
Let's just be sure we haven't missed anything on the checklist.
Did they get us shafted on the on that LOS?
Yes.
Let's see. We want 20 degrees and we're making...
No, 10 degrees.
Yes. Yes, 10. And we're making 4 degrees a minute. So, it should change our AOS time - I mean our sunrise time to 2 and a half minutes.
And it should be earlier. Sunset should be earlier and sunrise should be earlier. Well, what does that work out for sunrise?
02:19.
Okay. looking at our fuel pressure - I mean, oxidizer pressure should stay at 36 - 35, and fuel at 20.
Okay, Al, do you want to check your DAC and make sure its settings are it - on it like you want it, to get it done. T8 at 250th.
Okay. Let me check it for you. I've got a T8, and it's focused at 7 feet. I've got a 250th.
Okay. Twelve frames...
Twelve frames a second.
Magazine A.
Magazine A.
Got an 18-millimeter lens with the right-angle mirror on it.
Exactly.
Okay. I'm going to set up the Hasselblad then.
Okay. We're 9 and a half minutes from time base 6.
Okay.
Yes, I'm glad you called that, Ed. It shows you what you can do. I had apparently knocked that thing to 24 frames per second.
Really?
Yes. It's now sitting at 12.
Okay. Let's, just for the hell of it, take some pictures of that - top of that booster anyway, huh?
Yes, I'm going to try to. You mean with the Hasselblad or what?
Yes, the Hasselblad.
Yes, with the Hasselblad. We're supposed to do it only, you know, provided it locks anomalous to us, but I think we ought to just go ahead and take a few pictures...
Yes, I think we ought to...
Oh, yes. I think we ought to take a couple as we come off. And then, when we roll and it comes in the hatch window, I think you ought to take a couple out of the hatch window.
Have you got a range sight on the camera?
No, not right now. Wouldn't hurt if we did, but we don't.
Yes, I got myself all strapped in now.
Okay. ASA 64.
Okay. Time base 6 for a start, and then, we'll have sunrise. And then, we'll do all those good things,
Then we'll get AOS from Carnarvon. We'll get a Go for TLI, and we'll burn the son of a gun.
Beautiful.
Some ride.
I have to get closer..
Some ride.
There was no doubt in your mind of lift-off, I was a little surprised at the level of the vibration prior to lift-off though. I'd been led to believe it was probably worse. Maybe they're strapping us in tighter nowadays.
I didn't have any trouble with communications or anything.
Oh, it was beautiful all the way. Boy, that BPC goes, doesn't it? That tower, son of a bitch moves out. I didn't even notice the switches being hard (laughter). I didn't figure I would.
(Yawn)
I didn't figure I would. Man, it was beautiful! All the checks right on the mark. Played her right like the sim. just like the simulator.
I guess, in order to make sure we don't screw that up, I guess I'd better pull that dark slide out right now. Right there.
yet.
Yes, but I don't want to - be ready to take a picture and miss a picture because of it.
Anybody want any water?
Yes. I'll take a slug of water.
a good place to leave that baby.
How long before time base 6?
Oh, about 5 minutes.
I'm getting kind of hungry. I'm going to have to watch my weight. I'm going to really slurp it up at the table tonight...
up in there.
Well, be back.
Pretty tasty water.
Well, there goes the monitor. Watch out for the trim.
I tell you, this weightlessness is really great, isn't it?
Yes, I'll enjoy it.
Zero g. Fantastic!
I want to see the stars out there.
I don't feel any - any more stuffy than I did this morning.
I'm - I'm kind of surprised at that, too. I - I think Al Bean made the comment that everybody's face looked puffed up.
Yes?
Your face doesn't look puffed up to me, particularly,
I'm sure there is some adjustment...
Yes.
you adjust to the - You know, the old - your cardiovascular - relaxes..
I just feel great, personally.
Well, hell, after the goddamn launch like that, who couldn't feel great?
Oh, I've got a little stuffiness in my head, I...
Yes,
You know, it sort of feels like you're - maybe when you're pulling 1 and a half or 2g's with a - with a cold.
Yes.
It sort of feels just like it.
I can't help but feel I'm laying on my back.
I sort of feel like I'm laying head down somewhere. Maybe that's because of the...
Stuffiness?
stuffiness in my head.
Yes, feet slightly elevated.
Like resting on the sit-up board at...
Yes.
high angle.
Yes.
Apollo, Houston; this - Apollo 14, this is Houston through ARIA 4. How do you read?
I'll be damned!
Houston, this is Apollo 14. Loud and clear. How me?
Roger. You're readable; a little bit in the background noise, but loud and readable.
Roger, Houston.
When did we say it was going to be?
What's that?
What was that figure, Stu-babe?
We said - 19:16.
19:16. Okay. Okay.
Okay, Houston; 14. How do you read now?
Apollo 14, Houston. You're readable, too. Go ahead.
Okay, I was just checking the comm here. Gee, you're just beautiful; the ARIA is really putting out for us.
Roger. I guess this is the best ever for ARIA.
Eighty seconds to time base 6 start, troops.
Okay.
Launch Vehicle Guidance to IU, verify.
Launch Vehicle Guidance to IU. Never has moved.
Okay.
Although we were ready for it...
Standing by for the Uplink Activity light.
Sixty-five seconds.
(Humming)
I want you to mark when that Sun comes over the horizon.
All right. You want to not look at it?
Well, it's right in my window.
Yes.
Thirty seconds to start of time base 6,
Okay.
Okay.
We get an Uplink Activity light and an S-II Sep light.
Okay. We have an S-II Sep light.
About a second late.
Yes, it looked like it was a little late, didn't it? When that light goes out, I'm going to start my timer.
Okay. Count down to the Sun.
Down to 5-second count.
Okay. The light's out. Timer starting.
And counting. Watch the sunrise in your eye, Al.
Okay. Tank pressure's 35 and 20. That looks good.
Okay. Verify Spacecraft Control, SCS.
Okay. SCS.
And monitor your tank pressures.
Okay. Is the Sun on time?
The Sun is...
Pretty - pretty damn close.
it's just - just a little early.
No, it isn't...
It was early on...
not by our time.
Okay.
Our 19:16.
Right.
Okay. Master Alarm, O2 Flow Hi.
You have a - Direct O2 valve?
It's off.
Cabin is good.
Okay...
It's holding inside the cabin. Forgot to trigger it. I'll have - Well, hell, it's down below the Go mark. It can't be.
What?
It's just a transient. Had to be.
Yes.
3.9.
Turn your suit regulator over there. Just turn it - it's on Both. Turn it up to 1...
Okay.
Okay, suit's on 1?
Yes.
Okay. Turn it on 2.
Okay, it's on 2.
Okay.
Okay.
Apollo 14, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger; we missed if you did call time base 6 starting. We'd like to know how the tank pressures look; over.
Okay, it looked to us like time base started within 1 second of nominal time, and the oxidizer tank is currently - quietly - at 37 and the tank is currently setting quietly at 26.
Oh, wait a minute.
You're going to get Up TLM...
Roger, Al.
We command Block on both of them.
Block, Block.
Okay. RHC number 2, armed.
Okay. Verify.
ORDEAL, 300/Lunar.
Verify.
FDAI - ORDEAL FDAI 1, Orb Rate; 2, Inertial.
Okay; 1 is Orb Rate, 2 is Inertial.
And we're standing by to slew to 20.5 at - at 57.
We're a little bit ahead of that, in fact. 54, 55...
Eight degrees - would be 28 and a half at 55.
Okay.
Yes, you know we did that in the sim - got fouled up on that, too.
With the venting?
Is the tape recorder barber pole? Okay. I guess they're not getting data up right now. We're still through the ARIA. I guess we haven't got...
No, we've lost the LOS on the ARIA.
And I'll bet what happens is, if the suit accumulator cycles, it might kick that over to the...
Yes.
high O2.
Okay. I think I've got my Orb Rate ball set up where we can check it again in another minute. Tank pressures are reading 40. We're out of comm with them now, are we?
Yes.
We should have them again here in about 2 minutes.
Tank pressures look good. Oxidizer, 39, fuel's coming up to 40. Beautiful, S-IVB. At 56 minutes, we should be at 24 and a half.
Apollo 14, Houston. Over.
That Sun in your eye?
Huh?
I thought that Sun was shining...
My Orb Rate ball is exactly right.
Roger; copy.
Half a degree.
Okay, Houston. 14.
14, Houston. How do you read?
Did you notice that that VHF volume being full up distorted the...
Yes.
his VHF?
Uh-huh.
I couldn't understand why he sounded so garbled there.
You aren't kidding.
You ain't the only one.
Okay. Coming up on 57. It should be 20.5.
That's affirm.
That's right: 57 and 20.5.
It's now 21 right about there. Yes, look at that mother.
What's our time, Al?
55, 56.
Pardon?
Okay. We are 57 minutes now and we're 20.5.
Okay. ORDEAL Mode, Hold/Fast.
It is Hold/Fast.
And call P47.
Okay, Houston; 14. How do you read us?
Roger, 14; this is Houston through Carnarvon, and you're loud and clear.
You're 5 square.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead.
You're Go for the Moon. Go for TLI.
Roger. Go for TLI.
S-II Sep light...
It's on, right on the money.
on, 58:36.
Okay. Should be starting ullage now.
I don't feel it or we'd be floating down.
Doesn't start until 58..
Don't see any counts, do you?
Wasn't that a 2 a minute ago?
Yes.
It probably isn't going to be as a 1. Now it's a zero.
It's counting us down.
Yes. It's counting.
Okay. At 59 minutes, Al, you should have 12 50 - 12.5. Is it after 59?
59:19.
Okay.
S-II Sep light out on time.
Okay, TIG minus 18.
Okay. Right on the money, 8.5. Operate/Slow.
We have Ignition.
There she goes.
Roger; Ignition.
How about that?
Very nice.
Nice start.
Smooth start. Steering's good.
Roger, and we show good thrust on the S-IVB.
2:28...
Unbalance.
That thrust is...
Yes, it's pitch down. Yes.
It's all right.
It knows what it's doing. 28, 29, 30. Okay, at 30, it should come on 129 - and it's very close.
Yes, Michael Wash gave us the right numbers. We're right on cue.
At 1 minute, it should be at 120 - 128.
Slight vibration, coming along very smooth.
Okay. 128, on the money. A little low in altitude.
All those g's make me hungry.
2430.
127.
All those g's! We've got 0.5.
How much is it?
Yes, but it got my stomach to realizing I was hungry.
O2 Flow Hi.
Ignore it.
Ignore it.
Okay, tank pressures are still good.
Two minutes, 126.
Houston. Tank pressures are steady at 40 and 30.
14, Houston. Roger.
What was that?
Must have been a PU-use shift.
Yes.
Man, that's like cutting in the AB.
Yes. Seven-tenths of a g now.
Yes, it sure is. Got the monitor right in my lap.
A little low on my card.
Okay.
But the angles are good. Maybe the buildup data isn't too striking, you know.
Keep analyzing. Here comes Key Release. Key Release. Key Release, Stu.
No, that's - that's just to go back to now.
I.
Okay. Yes, I've got a 62 over an 80.
Oh, okay.
Okay. Three minutes, 112 - We're 109, 767.
Okay.
She's coming up.
Okay.
It does change vibration modes with the mass, doesn't it?
Okay. There's 3:30.
Okay.
117 - We're 114, 1050, 30. It's a little - running a little low.
Come on, baby.
Okay, coming up on 4 minutes.
Do your thing.
Okay, 120.
We only pitching about 1 degree right now.
Pulling one g, troops.
Okay.
Feels kind of heavy, doesn't it?
Yes (laughter).
Yes.
Okay, 4 minutes and 20...
this is.
to burn.
We're running about 3 miles low.
Okay.
What about H-dot?
But she's pretty steady.
Okay. It's back to about zero on the ball.
And we have 05.
Okay.
Okay. Five minutes. H-dot's a tad low, altitude's a little low, and the velocity's just about in the money. Okay. We're looking for 35...
14, Houston. Through ARIA 2. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
That - Burn's going well.
Okay, Al. I have about...
Okay, let us talk about what we're going to do.
Okay.
35559.
We're going to see that on the DSKY. And then we're going to shut down.
We've got 30 - 25 seconds to cut-off.
We're getting a yaw in here, too.
There's 35 - 100, 200, 275, 350, 450. Should be shutting down.
There's the Cut-Off.
Roger, 14. Cut-Off.
Okay.
are venting down. The oxidizer is coming down through 35 now. The fuel is coming down through 30.
Okay, Al. SCS TVC...
Apollo 14. Roger on the vent.
Servo Power, number 1, Off.
It's Off.
Rate, Low.
Rate, Low. Okay.
No, no, no. Bit Rate, Low.
Oh, Bit Rate, Low.
Okay.
That's you.
Yes, yes, I got it. EMS Mode, Standby.
Houston, 14.
EMS Function, Off.
14, Houston. Go ahead.
Reading a VI, plus 35542; Delta-VC, minus 8.8, H-dot plus 04399, H-pad, plus 01747
Okay, Delta-Vs, Off.
Okay. Let's start again. EMS Mode, Standby; EMS Function, Off.
EMS Mode, Standby; EMS Function, Off.
SECS...
14, this is Houston. We copy VI, plus 35542, Delta-VC of minus 8.8, and missed the last two? Would you repeat?
Okay. H-dot, plus 04399; altitude, plus 01747.
Pyro Arm switches are off.
Roger. Plus 04399 and plus 01747.
Okay. I'm not sure I got your H-dot readback. It's plus 04399.
Roger. 04399.
Okay, FDAI number 1, Inertial; RHC number 2, locked.
Okay, FDAI number 1 is now Inertial; RHC number 2 is now locked.
And Stu is going to Pro and to P00.
Okay. Let me get the Activity light out.
How close did that baby cut out?
On time.
No, on velocity, Stu?
Well, it was - 20...
Within 7 feet per second, it looks like.
Nineteen...
CMC and feet per second.
Yes, yes.
Okay, and let's see. Your H-dot's 4399 - You said that's good.
H - the H was low. See, we were low all the way. That may have been the design or something.
Okay, Ed.
Okay, CMC Activity light out, key Verb - key Verb 66 Enter, Stu.
I'll have to get that. We got.
At your - Switch couches.
Get out of my couch.
Did you get your FDAI 1 - number 1 to Inertial off?
Yes., I did.
Okay.
Houston. On the S-IVB, oxidizer pressure is now down around 18 and fuel pressure is about 17.
And, Stu, did you get - put the Waste Stowage Vent valve to Close?
Roger. I understand; 18 and 17 on the tank pressures.
We still have comm with him?
Marginal.
Oh, it's still kind of...
Okay, I guess he's reading us.
What are you going to do about your connections?
On.
Let's - It looks like...
Oh, look at us climb away.
suits.
Doff the suits.
Okay. Okay, Suit Power...
Let's see. Let me get this Waste Stowage Vent before...
Yes;, Waste Stowage Vent valve, Closed.
Okay, it's Closed.
Let me see, I'm turning off...
