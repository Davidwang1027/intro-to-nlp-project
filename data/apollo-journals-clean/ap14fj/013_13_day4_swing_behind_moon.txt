14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, we'd like P00 and Accept, and we'll pump you up the state vector, preliminary target load and REFSMMAT. [Long pause.]
Did you copy, 14?
We've got it.
Okay.
14, Houston. The computer is yours now.
Okay.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, I have a preliminary LOI maneuver PAD ready. [Long pause.]
Okay, Freddo. I'm ready to copy your preliminary LOI-1 PAD.
Okay, it's SPS/G&N, 63306, plus 0.90, minus 0.33; 082:36:46.55; minus 2801.9, minus 1105.3, minus 0227.3; 351, 258, 326; 0172.3, plus 0058.4; 3020.6, 6:12, 3013.1; 12, 288.3, 27.1; and the rest of the column N/A. Star 15, Sirius, and star 12, Rigel.
Okay, on the zero mark, the set stars R-align, 127; P-align, 148; Y-align, 015; no ullage; LM weight, 33675. [Long pause.]
Freddo, would you give me the minutes of Noun 33 again, please?
Okay, 36.
Okay, it's an LOI preliminary SPS/G&N, 63306, plus 0.90, minus 0.33; 082:36:46.55; minus 2801.9, minus 1105.3, minus 0227.3; 351, 258, 326; 0172.3, plus 0058.4; 3020.6, 6:12, 3013.1; 12, 288.3, 27.1; the rest NA. Set stars, Sirius and Rigel, at 127, 148, 015; no Ullage; LM weight, 33675. [Long pause.]
Okay, Ed; was good readback.
Okay.
And, Houston; 14. Did you get the 93s and the torquing time?
We've got the 93s, Al, but we need the torque time.
Okay, 079:39:20.
Copy, 079:39:20.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Al, while you still maybe got that PAD book handy, I got a TEI-4 PAD ready to come up. [Long pause.]
Okay. Go ahead with your PAD.
Roger. TEI-4: SPS/G&N; 38242; plus 0.90, minus 0.33; 091:17:38.52; plus 3903.4, plus 0706.3, minus 0165.8; 181, 069, 012. Rest of column N/A. Ullage four jets, 14 seconds. Other remarks: assumes burn undocked, and assumes no DOI. Okay and ... [Long pause.]
TEI-4 and SPS/G&N ... [Long pause.]
Okay, I've got one correction before you read back, Al. They gave me the docked pitch and yaw trim, the Noun 48s, and I need to change those on you right now. Okay. The pitch should be minus 0.57, and the yaw trim, plus 0.40. [Long pause.]
Okay, I have it as follows: TEI-4: SPS/G&N, plus 38242; minus 0.57, plus 0.40; 091:17:38.52, plus 3903.4, plus 0706.8. I need Delta-VZ; 181,069,012; four-jet ullage, 14 seconds, burn undocked. [Long pause.]
Okay, Al. Noun 81, I maybe heard you wrong. Delta-VY, first, should be plus 0706.3; and the Delta-VZ, minus 0165.8, and the last remark is "assumes no DOI." [Long pause.]
All right, will repeat Delta-VY, plus 0706.3, and minus 0165.8; last remark, "assumes no DOI."
Okay. Good readback.
14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, if Ed's got a minute there, I'd like to proceed through a little bit of looking at the high gain.
Okay, Freddo. Just 1, please.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, I'm ready. What do you want to do?
Okay, first match your dial of pitch and yaw indications with what you're reading on the indicators. [Long pause.]
Okay.
Now, Manual and Wide. [Long pause.]
Okay, you have it.
Okay, put the High Gain Servo Electronics switch back to Primary, and after that go through another normal acquisition.
Okeydoke.
It locked up, immediately, Freddo.
Very good.
The only thing different than what it was doing this morning was that, it was not increasing signal strength immediately upon going to Medium or Narrow.
Roger, Ed.
And - and, of course, it seemed to be oscillating after that. It's steady now.
Okay.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Is everybody on the line now, Al, so I can pass up this docking probe status?
Stand by 1.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Houston, can we give you a call in about 20 minutes?
Okay.
Houston, 14. I have the null bias check figures for you.
Go ahead, Al.
Okay, we went from minus 100, to minus 985.
Okay, we got that, Al.
Houston, Apollo 14. We're ready for the discussion of the probe, now.
Okay, Al. Okay, the conclusion down here is that on your final attempt, the probe spring started to compress slightly, followed by the capture latch engagement talkbacks going barber pole. The bottle then fired and the retraction looked normal, although the time was somewhat shorter due to the contingent firing of the Command Module RCS jets. The talkback operation during the initial extension in the final docking, plus the accelerometer data, and also the look-see at the capture latch release motor currents during the extension, all indicated a normal extension, capture, and retract sequence. Some consideration, Al, was given to the possibility that the RCS thrusting compressed the drogue/probe maybe until the docking latches engaged, but the final word was that this would require more force than the RCS could provide. And I guess the most important fact is - as discussed yesterday, we're Go for the mission.
Okay. Do you suggest any special docking technique for the final docking and rendezvous?
Yes, we're, we're still ...
I'm thinking of course in ...
Okay, we don't have any ...
... I'm thinking, of course, in terms of the different masses.
Roger, Al. We don't have any procedure ready at this time. We're still thinking about the possibilities, and we'll have that ready for you before the time.
Okay.
Hey, Fred?
Go ahead.
Okay, could we hit that again, now? I guess I don't understand why - why it didn't work on the other - on the other docking.
Yes, I guess we don't have that answer for you, Stu.
All, all we can say is ...
Are - are we saying that the ...
Yes. We can't explain the preceding attempts, but all we're saying is that the one that worked looked normal.
Okay, I guess I disagree with it looking normal, but the probe sure does look good now. Are you saying there's no correlation between the retraction and the - I mean, using the retract bottle and getting the docking? [Long pause.]
Stand by 1, Stu. [Long pause.]
Okay. I'm not sure if I'm answering the question you, you, asked, Stu, but what the data showed is that the - the bottle had fired, and started to pull things in before you all actually worked the switch and maybe you thought the reverse was true. [Long pause.]
What? Let me see - say that again, Fred. I don't understand that one.
Okay, I guess there's a distinction in, maybe your impressions, and what the data said was that you did get captured, normally before the bottle was fired. Did you all have a different impression? [Long pause.]
Yes. Stand by 1.
Yes, Fred, our impression was that - see the talkbacks going barber pole, which would indicate the capture by the latches - didn't happen until, oh, I think as Al said the other time, several seconds after he hit the Retract switch. [Long pause.]
Hey, but we're not trying to talk you out of anything that - we think the probe is - is - fine, we just want to make sure we're clarified on the procedures.
Okay, Stu.
14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We'd like P00 and Accept, and we'll get you in the final vector and target load.
Okay, Freddo. You got it.
Okay. And I'm ready with the LOI PAD now.
Stand by 1, Freddo. [Long pause.]
Just a minute, Fred. Is this going to be a correction to the previous PAD, or a complete new PAD?
Well, it's a final one, and I think there's enough difference, you probably ought to use another sheet there.
Okay.
Ready to copy.
Okay. SPS/G&N; 63306; plus 0.90, minus 0.33; 082:36:42.70; minus 2804.9, minus 1103.5, minus 0227.0; 351, 258, 326; 0169.3, plus 0058.1; 3022.7, 6:12, 3015.2; 12, 288.3, 27.1. The rest of column N/A, and all the comments in the set stars information is the same as before.
Okay. On the LOI PAD, SPS/G&N; 63306; plus 0.90, minus 0.33; 082:36:42.70; minus 2804.9, minus 1103.5, minus 0227.0; 351, 258, 326; 0169.3, plus 0058.1; 3022.7, 6:12, 3015.2; 12, 288.3, 27.1; the rest, N/A, and set stars and ullage, and LM weight remain the same. [Long pause.]
Good readback, Ed.
And, 14; Houston. The computer's yours.
Okay, Houston. Good. [Long pause.]
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Ed, if you have any problem acquiring with the High Gain back at LOS - or AOS - in Auto, just put her in Manual and Wide, and we can get the dump and everything there.
Okay, Freddo. Will - will do. [Long pause.]
14, Houston. When you can work it in, I got the map updates for Rev 1.
Okay, Freddo. I'm ready to copy.
Okay. LOS, 82:23:58; 180: 82:38:30; AOS with, 82:56:27; and AOS without, 82:49:15. [Long pause.]
Okay, Freddo. 82:23:58; 82:38:30; and the one we'll use 82:56:27; and 82:49:15.
Good readback.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. When you get to the - or it's convenient in here, Ed - when you're fiddling with the O2 heater switches, we'd like the 50-Watt Heater breaker on 226 for tank 3 that you have open, we'd like that one closed now. [Long pause.]
You have it, Freddo.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 14. How do you read now?
Loud and clear, Ed.
Okay, I am on Omni Charlie.
Okay, Ed.
Say again.
Okay, Ed. Copied Omni Charlie.
Okay.
And, Houston, we're in burn attitude.
Roger. In burn attitude.
And, Houston; 14. The sextant star check is real good.
Roger, Stu.
14, Houston. We've got your VGs and P40, and they look mighty fine.
Okay.
Okay.
How you doing today, Ron?
Hey, real good.
Hey, 14; Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, Ed. We're still showing the O2 flow up a little bit for about an hour now. I just wondered there. You still venting something maybe?
We turned it off a few minutes ago. It should be coming down shortly.
Okay, Ed.
It's already started to drop down Freddo. I think it'll be down normal real soon.
Okay.
14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Hey, Al. Everything looks good down here and you have a GO for LOI.
Thank you. We'll give it a GO for LOI.
S-IVB lunar impact, 83:07.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We're about 45 seconds now to LOS, Ed. We'll see you on the other side.
Roger, Freddo. Thank you.
