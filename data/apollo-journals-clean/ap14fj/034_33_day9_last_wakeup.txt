Hello, 14; Houston.
Houston, Apollo 14. Good morning, Freddo.
Good morning, Ed. Down the home stretch. I show you're about 55 grand out, now. I got a few things here for you, if you got a Flight Plan handy.
Okay. Let me get some lights on first, Fred.
Okay.
Okay, Freddo; go ahead with your updates.
Okay, first we got a consumables update; GET of 208 hours; 44.0; quad A, 44.9; B, 41.0; C, 45.7; and D, 44.4; H2 tank 1, 30.7; and 2, 29.2; O2 tank 1, 63.3; 2, 65.0; 3 is 10.9; and why don't you go ahead with that readback - if you want, Ed - first.
Okay. 208.00; 44, RCS total; quads, 44.9, 41.0, 45.7, 44.4; hydrogen, [garble] .7, 29.2; oxygen, [garble], [garble], 10.9.
Okay. Stand by 1.
Okay, 14; how do you read now? We had to get the VOGAs off the line.
Okay. Loud and clear, Freddo.
Yes, you're good now. Right to the left of the consumables update block, there's a Verb 29 maneuver to the optics CAL attitude at about 208:30; and your High Gain angles there should - should be Pitch, minus 73; and the Yaw number there should be .102.
Okay. That's corrected. Thank you. 102.
Okay - and let's see - we'd like the potty tank inlet valve to close, so we can get a little more water into the waste tank.
Okay, I'll do that right now.
And, 14; Houston. You still there?
That's affirm, and the potty tank's closed off.
Okay, Ed. Let's see. They'd like here the readouts that you have there for the onboard Pitch and Yaw S-band meters. And also the dials.
Okay - at this moment, you mean?
That's affirm, Ed.
Yes. It looks like at this moment, they're setting at - plus 60 and 360. And the thumbwheels are sitting at minus 52 and 270.
Okay, copied, Ed.
And, 14; Houston.
Go ahead, Fred.
Okay, we've got that number 3 tank down low enough now; so, hereafter - just in case you're wondering we'll keep tanks - O2 TANKs 1 and 2 in Auto, and we'll leave Tank number 3 , Off, O-F-F.
Okay. That's my current, configuration, and I understand it will stay that way.
Roger, Ed. And we've got the torque angles okay.
Okay.
And let's see, 14; one other note here they missed - says they missed getting a presleep medication report - and from that I assume you didn't have any medication. Is that correct?
That's a good assumption.
Okay.
Okay, 14. I've got one other thing which concerns verifying where you've got some stowage, and it's not too time-critical - so, if you want to - go ahead and get cleaned up first and just give me a call when you want to talk about that.
Okay. .
Got anything that's outstanding we owe you right now, Freddo - like checklist...
No, I think we've got everything taken care of except finding out for sure where you got all the bags.
Okay. Well, right now,, we don't have them all - we don't have them all stowed, but we know exactly where we're going to put them, and we'll be starting that before long.
Okay.
Houston, 14. Freddo, did you get the Noun 93s pertaining to [garble]?
That's affirm, 14. We got those.
Okay, the time we're using is 208:11:05.
Roger; 208:11:05.
Houston, 14.
Go ahead, 14.
Okay. Postsleep report. On sleep, Al and Stu had 4 hours each; I had 6. On the PRD, Al is 16062; Ed, 07060.
Okay. Copied sleep report - or postsleep report; 4, 4, and 6 hours, with you getting the 6, and I copied the other numbers - dosimeters.
Roger. And I was the one on the headset, too.
Hey, are you reading, Ed?
Go ahead.
Hey, you can tell Stu I watched the press conference, and I hope he didn't let all the lunar fines out there.
He did a pretty good job of letting part of them.
Yes, I could see that.
[Garble], Fred?
We've got it all cleaned up now, though.
Okay.
We don't have any dust in here, Fred. You can see that.
And, 14; Houston. We'd like the high gain cranked up when you get at it there.
Okay, Freddo. Stand by 1.
And you got her, Freddo.
Okay. Thank you. .
Not bad, Stu.
Well, I'm not sure whether It's good or bad, Fred. I think we probably need some update. That doesn't help me much.
Well, Dave here says you're looking pretty close.
Or maybe it's like the old saying, even the blind squirrel finds a nut, now and then.
Hey, you're just all heart this morning, Freddo.
Didn't want you overconfident.
And, Stu, Dave wonders if you want to proceed from here, maybe, and look at the Delta-Vs and P37, and he'll compare with you.
Okay. We might try that, depending on the time here; still a little stowage I want to get on.
Okay.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Hey, just thought Stu would be interested. After his last sets of marks there, we have his gamma, now, down to within about 0.05 degrees; and altitude, against ours, about - within 4/10ths of a mile.
I knew he would get a little bit better with his marks.
Houston, 14,
Go ahead, 14.
Freddo, we're starting into getting these bags stowed in here. You said you had a storage update for us - [garble] we have.
I'm not sure it's an update, Ed. You may have already gotten the word, but there was a conflict in a note that RETRO had on one of them. And it indicated maybe you had put it in a different spot. And...
[Garble] I don't knew which one you're referring to, but go ahead and let's hear it.
Okay. I'll just read - there's only three items -three items; and one says that the 30-pound bag will be put on A-13, the 20-pound bag on A-8, and Stu's suit with the helmet and a sleeping bag will be on top of the - also on top of A-8.
Okay. Stand by just a minute.
Freddo, we were putting the 20-pounder on A-8 with the suit on top of it. Is that the way you want it now?
That's correct.
Okay. That's the way we're going.
Very good.
14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Ed. Would you verify the Fans, Off?
Stand by, Freddo.
Okay, they're Off now.
Roger, Ed.
14, Houston.
Go ahead, Freddo.
Okay. You all can crank the carousel up there anytime. And before you do, we'd like you to check the S-BAND Pitch knob at minus 40, Yaw at 90, Reacq, and we'd like Medium Beam width now.
Okay. You want minus 40, 90, Reacq, and we're ready to spin up.
Okay. And that was Medium Beam width, Ed.
Roger. Medium Beam width.
14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We won't be needing MCC-7.
Roger. Said no MC-7 - MCC-7- Thank you, Freddo.
[Garble].
Houston, Apollo 14.
Go ahead, 14.
Let me give you Command Module RCS injector valve Temps.
Okay. Go ahead, Ed.
Okay. Systems Test Meter: 5 Charlie, 4.4; 5 Delta, 5.1; 6 Alpha, 4.5; Bravo, 4.4; Coco, 4.4; and Delta, 4.5.
Okay. We've got them in.
Houston, Apollo 14.
Go ahead, -14. Over.
Hello, Bruce. Say, I thought I'd try to make the surgeon happy for the last 4 or 5 hours in the flight. Have him check my biomed now, please.
Roger, Ed. Understand you'd like a biomed-harness integrity and telemetry check. Over.
That's affirmative.
Okay. We'll get them going on it.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. The Surgeon reports that they have good data on all crewmen, with the exception of Ed's respiration rate. The ZPN sensors are still not getting through on telemetry; however, don't worry about it at this time. They're happy with what they've got; and, medically, you're Go for entry. Over.
Okay. Well, I just replaced one sensor that had come loose. I thought maybe that was the one causing the problem.
Okay. Right now, we're not getting your respiration rate. Which one did you - which one did you replace, Ed?
Actually, I replaced the top outer, not on the sternum, the one to the right.
Okay. Understand the upper one on the right side of your chest, not on the sternum. Over.
That's affirm. And, on the respiration here, let's see if I can press them and get them coming in. Yes, tell them to watch it now.
Okay. They're watching. All right.
And, 14, this is Houston. When you select Omni Charlie, would you give us a call, so that we can send you a Command Reset? Over.
Okay. I was just getting ready to do that when you called. It's going in now.
Roger. Thank you.
14, Ed; this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
We have seen no change in your impedance pneumograph. We suspect that it may be a problem in the signal conditioner. And the Surgeons thank you for your efforts in attempting to restore the axillary leads, but suggest that you just leave it as is for entry and not bother with it any further. Over.
Okay, I was pulling and tugging, and I'm convinced the sensor and harness is okay, Bruce. So, I agree with you; it must be somewhere down stream.
Roger; the feeling is that it's probably in the signal conditioner.
Okay, tell them not to worry. I'll hold my breath; and then, they'll know what the rate is.
Say, that sounds like a pretty good plan. Give us a mark when you start holding; and then, we'll time from there.
Okay.
Either that, or the Surgeons say that if - if you give us a mark when you start holding your breath, we'll give you a mark when the EKG goes flat. Over
That's a fair enough exchange.
14, Houston. The information that you sent us down on the systems test meter leads us to cancel the Command Module RCS preheat, as you probably surmised by now. We just wanted to make sure we were both on the same frequency. Over.
Okay, we concur. Thank you, Bruce.
Apollo 14, Stu. This is Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. In looking at your Noun 49 values, we're scratching our heads on the magnitude of the Delta-R and the Delta-V updates. Would you verify that - the first star, you were, in fact, using the far horizon; and on this one, you are using the near horizon. Over.
That's affirmative. I worried about that, too - at the size of them, Bruce. And I verify this one for sure on the near horizon; and you know, I'm 99 percent certain on - on the other one. I really didn't - I reshot and got that same large update, and thought it was pretty good, but I didn't see them taper down like they should have. I'm mystified, also.
Okay. Well, we're not meaning to - to try and backseat drive. We're trying to figure it out for you, also; and we wanted to confirm that before we went too much further. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. I have your reentry PAD whenever you're ready to copy. Over.
Okay, Houston. Ready to copy.
Roger. And would you confirm that star 23 was loaded in P23 this time? It looked like 22 as it went by us.
Roger; it was 22, Bruce. I went back on and checked that first star again, and I'm afraid that is the trouble - I shot the wrong horizon on the star 22.
And, Bruce, would you suggest that I shoot that over again? See if we can take that error out?
Stu, this is Houston. Go ahead and shoot star 22 over again, and we'll have some more detailed word for you on the sequence after that in a minute.
Okay.
And after reshooting star 22, Stu, you can press on to star 23; and there's no need to redo 64. Over.
Okay.
And, Ed, if you're ready, I've got the Entry PAD.
Okay. Let's copy.
Roger. Entry: mid-Pacific area; roll at .05g: 000, 154, 000; 216:10:47; 267; minus 27.02, minus 172.65; Max g, 06.2; 36170, 6.39; 1140.2, 36251; RRT, 216:27:47; 00:29; Noun 69 is NA; D0, 4.00, 02:09; 00:18, 03:33, 08:07; sextant star, 30, 354.3, 30.7; boresight star, Nu Hydra, up 21.1, left 2.8, up lift vector. Comments: Use 1, nonexit EMS pattern; 2, Moon check, Moon in left of window: roll 000, 182, 000; 3, Moonset GET, 216 plus 25 plus 15. RET of 90,000 feet, 6 plus 29. Main deploy, 8 plus 54. Landing, 13 plus 52. Constant-g entry is roll right. GDC Align, 322, 325, 018. And for your information, the MSFN values of gamma at Entry Interface are minus 6.39, comparing with the navigated value prior to this last set of P23s of minus 6.42. The MSFN vacuum perigee, 20.6. Your onboard vacuum perigee, 20.1. And back under GDC Align, it's Sirius and Rigel for the stars. Read back. Over.
Okay, Bruce, we have a MIDPAC landing at zero - Roll, pitch, and yaw: 000, 154, 000; 216:10:47; 267; minus 27.02, minus 172.65; Max g is 06.2; 36170, 6.39; 1140.2, 36251; 216:27:47; 00:29; D0 is 4.00, 02:09; 00:18, 03:33, 08:07; sextant star, 30, 354.3, 30.7; Nu Hydra, up 21.1, left 2.8, lift vector, up. Use nonexit EMS pattern.
Okay, for the Moon-check attitude, it's in the left of the window; and we should be at roll 000, 182, 000; and Moonset is at 216:25:15. RET of 90 K is 06:29; mains are 08:54; landing's at 13:52. For constant-g, roll right. GDC Align stars are Sirius and Rigel, with angles of 322, 325, 0l8. The MSFN entry gamma is minus 6.39, onboard gamma, 6.42. HP is 20.6 and 20.1.
Roger, 14. Readback correct. Out.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
After you have finished with this P23, Stu, we will uplink to you a new MSFN state vector for the CSM and load it into the IM state vector slot and leave it there until time to uplink you our final MSFN state vector, which will ccme about - come after your'last set of P23s. And for your information, in the event that we should have communications problems, the CSM state vector that we read up to you in the PAD yesterday would be acceptable for conducting an entry. Over.
Okay.
...
14, this is Houston.
Go ahead.
After Stu finishes his marks on this last star, we'd like him to stand by for a possible rerun of star 22, in the present attitude and configuration; we also have to do a ground tracking station handover here, and we'll do that after he finishes marking on this star and advise you. Over.
Understand.
14, this is Houston. If you'll give us P00 and Accept, we'd like to uplink to you a new CSM state vector for the LM slot. The - the desired orientation and entry Lat and Long. Over.
You've got it.
Okay.
14, this is Houston. We have finished with the uplink. The computer's yours. Our recommendation on the P23 sightings is that you return to star 22 and take additional marks until you are satisfied with the magnitude of the Delta-R, Delta-V updates, or until we start running shy on time. It looks now like we can slip the initial P52 you have scheduled at 212 hours down to about 213 hours, since we have canceled midcourse 7. Over.
Okay, Bruce. Just keep shooting star 22, only.
That's affirmative. The marks that you took that drove the state vector out were those derived frcm star 22, and I'm informed that the fastest way to bring your state vector back in would be to put in compensatory marks from the same general direction. Over.
Okay. We'll give it a go.
14, this is Houston. We show your computed value of vacuum perigee coming down into agreement with the MSFN value at the rate of about 2 miles or so per mark on star 22. Over.
Yes, Bruce. The way I figure it, I've got about 16 marks to go.
Well, we were going to say 10 marks to go, but we thought you'd figure we were being sarcastic.
No, I'm looking at Verb 83, and she's coming down about - well, it was 30 miles - down about 25 miles a mark.
You know, I could have already been through if I had a recycle on this program.
Okay, I'll tell the Min Key boys about that.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Stu, we're showing your calculation of vacuum perigee coming down only about 1 mile per mark at the present time. We've got about 21 miles for the MSFN solutions and about 53 for yours. We suggest that you terminate the P23 marking routines at this time and press on for the Flight Plan. Over.
Okay. Sounds like a good winner.
14, Houston. We copy your torquing angles.
Okay, and torquing is 212:58:50.
I'd suggest you give them a call on it so you could [aside] - -
* * ?
14, this is Houston. Before torquing to the entry REFSMMAT, we recommend SCS - and check your Limit Cycle switch, On, please. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 14, this is Houston.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, 14. We hadn't planned on any sort of a complete or comprehensive newscast this morning - on your way in to entry, as we figured you'd probably get a pretty good briefing after splashdown. There is one item I'd like to read up to you, however, if you have a minute.
Okay, go ahead with that - and we'd also be interested in what the weather is in the recovery area when you finish.
Okay, recovery area weather is about 1,500 - or 2,000 scattered, higher broken, winds from 100 degrees at 15 knots - the waves are - are two sets. You've got a batch of 2-foot waves with a 2-second period, and superimposed on them, you have some 4-foot waves with a 3-second period - and, in general, it looks pretty good. I can get some more details for you, if you're interested. Over.
Well, that's pretty good - unless it changes from that measurably, that sounds like it's not bad at all.
Right. And we'll have an update for you on the weather as you get closer to interface. This one is dateline Los Angeles. "A powerful Earthquake hit southern California at 8:01 central standard time today, causing two reported deaths, numerous injuries, and cracked buildings and highways. The jolting trembler was felt over at least 350 miles from Fresno to below the Mexican border. But damage was worse in Los Angeles and its heavily populated San Fernando Valley. The center of the shock was reported at 17 miles north of the valley in the rugged San Gabriel Mountains. Major damage is reported in the two closest towns of Newhall and Saugus, 35 miles northwest of downtown L.A. The magnitude of the shock was rated at between 6 and 6.5 on the Richter scale, which rates major quakes at 7 or more. It was the strongest quake in the Los Angeles area since the 1952 trembler at Tehachapi to the north, which had the magnitude of 7.2 and was strongly felt in L.A. It killed 13 persons. The San Francisco Earthquake was 8.25." Over.
Well, looks like San Andreas is kicking up again.
14, this is Houston. Whenever it is convenient with you, we would like to press on with the logic sequence check and get that out of the way. And I understand that this 212 alarm is expected - as a consequence of the CMC self-check.
Roger. We'll give you a buzz when we're ready to move out.
Roger.
Houston, on the logic sequences check, we're standing by for SECS Logic, on.
Stand by, please, 14.
14, this is Houston. We show that the Logic power is on at the present time. Over.
That's affirmative - -
We're standing by - -
We're standing by at the present time.
Yes. We're standing by on the step SECS Logic, two on, up.
Okay. That's what we show as already having been accomplished. What is the position of your SECS Logic switches? Over.
Okay. They are on, up. That was a cockpit error here. Okay, we're standing by for Go.
Roger, Ed. Your system is in a good configuration. Do not arm the pyros at this time; however, you would be Go, if you had desired to. Over.
Roger.
Eight ..,
14, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
Loud and clear, Houston.
Roger; reading you the same.
Torquing angles look good there, Stu.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. We'll be torquing at 214:38:45.
Roger, Al.
Apollo 4 - Apollo 4 - Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over. Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, 14.' We'd like to conduct the VHF SIMPLEX Alpha check at this time, if one of you can support it. Over.
This is Apollo 14, on VHF Alpha. How do you read?
Okay, Ed. We're reading you loud with a - a little bit of garble. I understand you've turned off your S-BAND T/R, and you're coming at us VHF Alpha. Is that correct? Over,
... I was coming at you simo that time. And I'm coming out VHF Alpha.
Roger. Standing by.
Houston, Apollo 14. How do you read VHF Alpha?
Oh, loud and clear, VHF Alpha, Ed. How me?
You can cut it down a little bit, Bruce; it's readable.
Okay. We're still over an hour - more likely, about an hour and 10 minutes out from the point we normally conduct the check, and chart is showing you about 17,000 miles out; so, I think it's a pretty good check. Over.
Very good.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
If you're interested, I have an update on the weather for you. Over.
All right. Stand by. Okay, go ahead with your weather update.
Roger. At your planned landing area, the general condition is good. You've got 2,000 feet scattered, high broken, and 10-mile visibility. The wind is 120 degrees at 15- Wave height is 4 feet, with a southerly swell of 4 feet. The altimeter is 3006 or minus 128-foot pressure altitude. GMT computed for your landing is 21:05 on the ninth. Sunrise was at 17:15 in the night; sunset at 06:20:00 on the tenth. That's for your G&N target point; and over at the constant-g target point, there's really no significant change between the order at the two places. Your recovery forces standing by are the landing platform helicopter, New Orleans, which is 5 miles from the target point. Swim 1 and 2, SH-3 helicopters in the vicinity of the target point, and the ship Ponchatoula at the backup target point; It's an A0, oiler. Other support, you've got Photo 1 and Relay 1, and SH-3 helicopters in the vicinity of the target point that are providing photo and voice coverage, and Samoa Rescue 1 and 2, HC-130s that are about 45 minutes away. Over.
Okay, Houston. I believe I got all of that, and I hope to be in contact with the New Orleans then very soon.
Roger.
And, Houston; 14. The EMS checks out real fine.
Roger, Stu. Copy EMS entry check complete.
14, this is Houston. If you could give us P00 and Accept, we have your final state vector uplink for you. Over.
Okay, Bruce. You've got it.
Roger.
14, Houston. We're through with the computer; the uplink's in, and you've got a MSFN state vector in both slots. Over.
Roger. Thank you, Bruce.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, 14. I've got some changes to your entry PAD. Over.
Okay. Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Under Noun 60, gamma at 400,000 feet should be minus - should be 6.37 vice 6.39 - I say again, 6.37. Over.
Understand; 6.37.
EMS range-to-go should be 1138.1. Over.
EMS range-to-go, 1138.1.
Okay. Time of V is going to be 02:10. Over.
VCIRC 02:10.
Time for ending blackout, 03:35. Over.
End of blackout at 03:35.
Drogue, 08:05. Over.
08:05.
90,000 feet, 6 plus 28; mains, 8 plus 53; and landing, 13 plus 51. That's knock 1 second off each of the last three. Over.
Understand; 1 second off the last three.
Roger.
Houston, 14. We are planning on activating the RCS about minus 1 hour.
Say again, 14.
We're planning on activating the Command Module RCS at about minus 1 hour.
Roger. We copy.
Okay, Houston. The Logic is on, and we're standing by for a Go for Pyro Arm.
Roger. We see the Logic on and stand by, please. Apollo 14, this is Houston. You are Go for Pyro Arm.
Roger, 14.
And we got both rings pressurized here.
Roger, 14. Okay. Both rings look good from down here, 14.
Jolly good.
