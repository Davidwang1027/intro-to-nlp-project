Lift-Off. Clock starts.
The clock start?
Roger. Clock start.
Beautiful!
Clear the tower!
Tower clear. Roll and pitch starts.
Oh! Look at that [garble]...
Roger; you have good thrust in all five engines. [Long pause.]
Beautiful.
Go, baby, go!
She's going; she's going. Everything's good.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. Roll complete.
Roger. Roll complete.
37, 38...
Stand by for Mode One Bravo.
40, 41...
Mark; One Bravo now.
Okay, we're One Bravo. [Long pause.]
One Bravo.
Okay. Coming up on our favorite number, babe.
Stand by. I didn't want you to - I was going to give you that one.
Cabin Pressure Relief.
Okay.
Good.
One minute and 69.
14, Houston. Everything looks good here on the ground.
Roger. [Long pause.]
And we got through Max Q real fine, troops.
Yes.
Watch her go.
Now, we're off and running. Look at the ice coming off.
Okay, coming up on 2...
Roger.
...3, 2 and a half g's.
Stand by for Mode One Charlie.
Mark; One Charlie now.
One Charlie.
We're One Charlie. EDS Auto's Off.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, inboard in about 10 seconds.
Roger.
Okay, about 2 seconds.
Inboard cut-off.
Roger. Inboard. [Long pause.]
[Garble].
Okay, attitude is good.
Yes.
About 10 seconds to cut-off.
[Garble].
Okay.
Five to go.
Cut-off.
Roger.
And separation.
Roger.
Ignition on five.
Roger.
Okay. You could see the flare from lift-off.
You sure could. Uh-huh.
Looks good on five engines.
Oh, beautiful.
Roger. We confirm good thrust on all five. [Long pause.]
Okay. Passing 3 minutes.
[Garble].
If we don't get that job...
S-II Sep.
...We're about 4 seconds from S-II Sep. Right.
S-II Sep.
Good Sep.
Skirt Sep.
Roger.
17, 18, 19, 20.
[Garble].
And there goes the tower.
There she goes!
Roger. We confirm the skirt Sep. And you're in Mode II now.
Mode II.
We're in Mode II in the cockpit, troops.
Okay...
Steam Press, Water, Auto.
...Pitch to Rate - Pitch to Rate Command Delta VC.
Roger, Ed. [Long pause.]
[Garble].
Better watch this; that horizon is beautiful.
It sure is!
Keep your eyes on the pin, cockpit troops.
Yes. Okay, we're coming up toward 4 minutes. We're pitching 42.6; it looks real good, leader.
Yes.
42.7 right now. That's good.
And that center engine is burning.
14, Houston. At 4 minutes, trajectory and guidance look good.
Okay, 4 minutes, 6 [garble]...
14; Roger.
Right smack dab in the money.
Beautiful.
Just smack dab in...
And, 14; Houston. The CMC is Go.
Roger; CMC, Go.
We're about 50 miles, Ed.
Oh, great. Everything's Go on this side, Al.
Good show, buddy.
Okay.
04:30. 73.5. We are absolutely beautiful. It is right in the fracking money. There's a little more ice flaking off.
Okay. We're still upstaging for three-on program at this point.
We don't have S-IVB...
No, we don't. No, we don't. That's right. COI's 5:45, not 4:45.
And at 5 minutes. Eighty miles. We're riding within two or three tenths of - of this profile. Beautiful.
Just can't beat it, huh?
Smooth. Just looks like a little side oscillation in the couch.
That's all you're feeling; just like a railroad coach is this couch.
Okay, 5 plus 20; we should have COI here in 25 seconds.
[garble] 25 seconds. About 13 2, 8 26...
Stand by for S-IVB to COI.
Mark. S-IVB to COI now.
S-IVB to COI.
Okay, Ed, babe, stand by for the gimbal motors.
Roger. And your times are nominal. Level sense arm, 8 plus 39, and S-II cut-off at 9 plus 16.
Gimbal motors...
Understand...
[Garble]. [Long pause.]
Pitch 1.
I've got it.
Yaw 1.
Got that one.
Pitch 2.
Got that one.
Yaw 2.
Got that one.
Okay. GPI. Verify a minus 145 and plus 130.
Roger.
[Garble].
[garble] Houston. Gimbal motors are running.
Roger, 14. Gimbal motors on. [Long pause.]
At 6:30. I think we got TLI, now, on that center engine, no matter what.
I think you're right...
Yes.
...about 2 and a fourth before nominal here. The heat's still going.
Stand by for S-IVB to orbit.
Mark. You have S-IVB to orbit now.
Roger. S-IVB orbit. [Long pause.]
And it's beautiful. This trajectory is absolutely fantastic.
Right along the [garble].
It's better than the simulator.
Okay. We got about 45 seconds now. [Garble] nominally.
Eleven minutes.
This guidance is steady as a rock.
We are right in the numbers. Just right - [garble] seems like there's something I ought to be doing. Strike 20 seconds from the board. [Garble] now.
There, it's real comfortable.
About 5 seconds.
Inboard cut-off.
Roger. Inboard. [Long pause.]
Right on time.
That's beautiful.
That computes to [garble]...
There she goes.
Hey, did you feel that PU valve?
Yes.
Yes. Sure did. Didn't hear it though.
Well, I - I had to give you noise from the simulator. Good. Can't give you everything. We're within 2/10ths in altitude. Just right down the money.
Stay that way, baby.
About 20 seconds to level sense arm.
14, Houston. You're Go for staging. The CMC is Go.
Roger. CMC, Go. [Long pause.]
Just a little high, but it's bringing the H-dot down. Just a little vibration about [garble]...
You have level sense arm now.
Roger. Level sense arm. [Long pause.]
Very slight pogo and starting at 8:40.
Yes.
Time hack. You ought to be pretty close to Mode IV.
Just a little high. We're about a mile high. It ought...
Stand by for a Mode IV capability.
Mark. You have it now.
[garble] seconds to speed.
Roger. Mode IV.
Okay. We're at 100 [garble].
Should have a cut-off.
We have a cut-off.
Roger. Cut-off.
Look at the flakes go.
And staging.
Look at the ice go up there.
Roger.
Yes. [Garble].
And good thrust on one [engine].
There's a big outside.
Roger.
A jillion stars.
Good thrust on one.
Okay.
14, Houston. Thrust looks good on the S-IVB.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
Okay. Okay. We're at 101.3 and it's bringing the H-dot down. Starting our run now.
[Garble]...
Just about 2,000 feet to go.
[Garble] in Mode IV.
At 101.5, I'll - Okay. We have 100, 25, 5; 77, 25, 5; 15. Okay. 256 60.
25,660.
Is - is our shutdown.
Okay. On the stage switch.
On the stage switch.
[Garble] get it...
14, Houston. Everything's looking perfect here.
Roger. [Long pause.]
H-dot is just about zero. We're 102...
Here, I can get it.
Okay. Got about 1,500 feet to go.
Okay.
It's pretty damn nominal, isn't it, so far?
Boy.
Magnificent.
14, Houston. Predicted cut-off is as planned, 11 plus 43.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 14, Houston. Predicted cut-off 11 plus 43 nominal. Over.
Rog. 11 plus 43. [Long pause.]
We've got a good cut-off.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 14, Houston. The booster is safed and your orbit is Go.
Roger. Good show. Go orbit; booster safe.
TVC Servo Power, two, coming Off now. [Long pause.]
14, Houston. I have a Z-torquing angle when you're ready to copy.
Okay. We're showing about 99 by 102.9.
[Garble] Safe.
Roger.
Okay, two, Safe.
SECS Logic, two, Off.
Arming breakers coming open.
Okay, three BMAGs going to Rate 2.
Okay, RCS Logic's Off.
Okay, two in Normal.
Apollo 14, Houston. The Saturn is configured for orbit. We're showing you in a 102 circular orbit...
Okay.
Understand. 102 circular. [Long pause.]
Okay, Gordon, I'll take the Z-torquing angle.
Roger, Stu. The Z-torquing angle is a plus 0.14. Over.
Plus 0.14.
Roger. [Long pause.]
14, Houston. You have 45 seconds to Vanguard LOS. There'll be about a 40-second gap to Canary.
Roger, Houston.
Apollo 14, Houston. How do you read through Canary?
Loud and clear, Houston.
And you're loud and clear.
14, Houston. About 45 seconds to LOS. We have nothing for you before Carnarvon. Over.
Roger. We're on the checklist.
Roger.
See you in Carnarvon, Gordo.
Roger, Ed.
