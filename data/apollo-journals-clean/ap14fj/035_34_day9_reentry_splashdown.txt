Apollo 14, this is Houston. All your systems are looking good from down here, and you're in great shape for the entry. The - the carrier is 5 miles off the target point, so you can go ahead and land right at the target point. Over.
They're up - Sun, I hope, - so they'll get a good picture of us.
Thank you for your kind words. Everything looks good up here. We are pressing on.
Houston, stand by for a thruster test, ring 2.
Roger. We're standing by, Ed.
Okay. Ring 2 looked good to us.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. They're both good to us.
14, this is Houston. We concur; both rings checked out good on the ground here, and we'd like to hold to the timeline in the entry checklist as far as getting the batteries on, on the remainder of the events, go. Over.
Okay. Hold on the batteries, then.
Roger.
14, for your information, Samoa Rescue 1 and 2 are on station, and helicopters are in the air.
Sounds good, Bruce.
Houston, standing by for Pyro Arm.
Go for Pyro Arm.
Okay. We've had separation, Houston.
Roger.
Don't see any horizon at all, huh?
Not yet, no.
Probably too much light in here. Why don't you flip your floods off and see if you can see a dark horizon.
The Moon is awful bright. I sure don't. All I see is a -
In other words, it must be shifting. Let's see, we've get - on the tape recorder - we have 30 minutes of high-bit-rate recording, don't we?
30 minutes? Yes. There's a decal down there that tells you that. You might verify. I think it's 30 minutes for 4 hours or something.
I thought there was, too, but I don't see it.
Right by the High switch? I saw that somewhere
That's right. Right, 30 minutes in 2 hours. Okay, we've got 10 minutes to interface and 13 minutes, so with 23, we've got plenty of high-bit-rate time.
Houston, 14.
Okay, Stu, you - okay, there's the Moon. I've got the Moon in 2. Moonset is 25:15.
Houston, Apollo 14.
Well, I got signal strength.
Yes-. We're on the right antennas. Everything looks good now.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 14.
There's the horizon.
Finally found one, huh?
Yes.
Houston, Apollo 14. Do you read?
Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
Okay, Bruce, we have you now, loud and clear.
Okay, as we reported, we got a good separation; we're back in plane; and we're following the horizon on down. Yes, there it is. Look at the airglow. No. Hell, that's -
Yes, there's the horizon.
Yes. It's a good solid horizon. You really don't see any airglow.
Not from the dark side.
Apollo 14, Apollo 14; this is Houston. Say again; you're very weak. Over.
I'll get it. Houston - -
Okay, Houston; we have had good separation. We're back in plane, following the horizon down. Over.
Roger; we copy you, now, loud and clear.
And you're looking very good from down here, 14.
Okay. Everything's fine up here.
Boy, I hope that Moon, stays in the window here, so ve get the picture.
Supposed to be set on the left-hand side, isn't it?
Yes. And it's almost sitting out cf my window.
I got it.
Yes, but it's - my window's the one that's got the camera in it.
Oh, you want it then.
We want to try to get a picture of the Moon sitting there. We show -
If you could yaw to about 5 degrees -
Give it to me. Give it to me. I'll do it handheld, if you want.
No, hell, you could -.05gs get you right after that. Let's don't - -
Two minutes.
Yes, let's don't take the camera out of the bracket. Might not get it back in time.
All right.
I think it's going to be close enough.
Okay, what's next on the checklist?
That's it,.05g's next - RET is next, rather.
Okay, Al, here we need...
Some more light.
Yes. Thank you. Beautiful. We need CMC, Rate Command, in case we go SCS; and, other than that, she looks good.
Need EMS Roll and.05g also.
That's right, and we need this to back up at 32.
If it doesn't work.
If it doesn't work. No matter what that reads, at 32, this switch goes off.
32?
At 32, right here.
Oh. That's true. If you don't have your.Cog light.
Yes. If - if it didn't start itself. Damn, that Moon's -
It's really hard to see it.
Yes. I think I'll put it back up a little bit. Oh, there's the - the terminator coming.
Yes, if you roll a little bit, Ed'll get it.
Yes. Yes. Okay, it's coming in nicely new.
14, this is Houston. We show you with 98.4 amp-hours left on the water, and that's 56 hours' endurance. Over.
Great, great.
Okay, 98.4 and 56. Thank you.
That's - that's great - -
Roger.
Got a good view.
Okay. There's some airglow.
Yes. It's starting to glow. We got a - Oh! Man, oh man; you can see it!
Well, we better run the camera.
No, I don't want to waste film yet. Wait until it starts to set.
Okay.
Well, let me see. You've got...
We've got a minute - I've got 45 seconds.
Oh, give it 45 seconds. Now, turn her on.
No, just a little more; I haven't got that much film.
Oh, turn it On, for Christ's sake. Run it at...
I've got my film budgeted.
Run at slower speed, for Christ's sake. Then you could - do something.
Hey, you've only got 30 seconds (laughter).
(Sound of camera running)
You bastards are running my film out before I get the chutes.
Oh, I'd rather have that than the chutes.
Oh, man that sure is pretty. Back home again. Keep it in the window. You're letting it get too high on me - -
All right.
- I mean, too far down.
There she goes. The real...
And Moonset, Houston.
The real Moonglow.
Roger, Stu.
(Camera stops)
Yes, that was the real Moonglow.
Okay.
Right about on time.
Right on time. About 2 seconds early.
Okay. Well, we ought to get back in some kind of attitude here.
Okay. Okay, I'm going - be on my cards here in just a minute. You'll be on your own.
We're at 154, pitch.
Okay, 154 is your attitude. We're waiting for RRT, which is exactly 2 minutes frcm now.
Stu needle looks like she's taking a notion to come off the peg.
The which needle?
The pitch steering needle.
Oh, the steering. You said the Stu needle, and I wondered what the hell - which needle you'd adopted
Okay, Stu, you're going to have Rate Command, CMC, Auto at.05g, right?
Okay, yes. Yes, well, CMC, anyway. If you want Auto, I'll put her there new.
Okay,
That should be taken out of the checklist. Put that fills all the squares.
Yes. You can have Auto whether you need it or not, huh?
That's right. Entry DAP does not look at the Mode switch.
Oh man, are we coming down!
