Apollo 14, Houston through Guam. Over.
They're not mine.
Go ahead, Houston. Say again.
You're loud and clear, Ed. And we should have continuous voice and data from here on out. You're loud and clear through Guam.
Okay, Gordon. We have your - have good signal strength for you now. And I might say the Earth is starting to drop away very rapidly at this point.
Roger.
Stu and Al have started to change seats. We're going into our...
Roger.
pre-Sep checklist.
Apollo 14, Houston. I have an update to your High Gain gimbal angles as shown on page 3-3 when you're ready.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay, about five lines from the bottom, this is the High Gain angles after pitch around for docking. It should be pitch, plus 11; and yaw, plus 306.
Understand. Pitch, plus 11; and yaw, plus 3 - plus 306.
Roger. That's right.
Apollo 14, Houston. I have some updates for your - for you now. Over.
What type of updates?
I've got the S-IVB maneuver time and Sep time that goes on 3-1, and then a new S-IVB viewing attitude.
Roger. I'm ready to copy.
The S-IVB maneuver time, 2:49:23. Maneuver will be complete in 3 minutes, and the nominal Sep time is 2:59:23.
Understand. S-IVB maneuver, 2:49:23 and it'll maneuver for 3 minutes. Sep is 2:59:25 - 23.
That's correct, Ed. And then on page 3-7 - stand by 1.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Terminate the cabin repressurization. We show you over 6 psi.
We beat you to it.
Okay. And we have 3.7 in front of you. I'll give you the new S-IVB view-attitude Noun 22 angles.
Okay, go ahead.
Okay, it's about a quarter of the way down where it reads 93, 39.6, and 355.8. Change them to read same for roll, 090; pitch, plus 349.0; and yaw, plus 356.0.
Rog; understand. Roll is the same, pitch is 349.0, yaw is 356.0.
Roger; your readback's correct.
Apollo 14, Houston. Give us Omni Charlie, please.
All right, Houston. You have Charlie.
Roger.
Houston, 14. The S-IVB tank pressures: oxidizer, 24, and fuel is 9.
Roger; oxidizer at 24; fuel, 9.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston; 14.
Roger; you are Go for Transposition and Docking, and we're to have a site handover from Guam to Goldstone at 3 hours even; over.
Okay, understand. We're going to Goldstone at 3, and we have a Go for T&D.
That's affirmative.
Verb 62...
you can get Go for pyro arm.
Houston, 14. I'd like a Go for pyro arm.
14, Houston. You're Go for pyro arm.
Okay.
armed. B's armed.
Okay, GDC Align.
0, 180, 0.
EMS Function, Delta-V.
Okay.
Verified.
Delta-V and Normal.
Okay, you can start your DET.
Verb 62 now.
Okay. What we're going to do here is start the DET. 59:50, I'll go to Auto; 59:58, I'll hit it with some thrust. I'll punch this and check and make sure these go to zero. You - you did do a Verb 62? Is that...
Okay.
Verb...
So we'll come off and, if this needle is negative, I'll go to Pitch to Accel Command, start it up, and, when she goes across, you'll give me two Pros...
Pros.
I'll go to Rate Command, and we'll come on around. Okay?
Okay. I'm ready.
Okay.
Let's set a record, shall...
Okay.
right.
Slow and easy.
Okay. And we're going to start.
Okay,.
Sweaty-palm time.
Okay. At 59:50, CMS Mode, Auto.
Sweaty-palm time.
no. Just do it slow and easy.
no. I just keep mumbling that.
Okay.
We're Auto. At 8:58, plus-X thrust and zero - 56, 57,...
There she blew.
Okay.
Okay. Okay. She's negative.
Is your launch vehicle tank pressure full scale low?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Okay, I'm going to start her...
Your propellants are all...
got two, and I...
Okay. Give me a couple Pros.
ready?
Ready.
Okay. Pro.
again.
Look out that window!
Yes, look at all that crap.
Okay, Houston. We've separated. Turnaround started.
Roger.
And we have the usual couple of Parker valves.
Roger.
Okay. Service Module RCS Second Propellant Fuel Press, low - or Close, and the Reactants valve, Normal.
want to verify...
Fuel propellant.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay. Can you see anything out there good?
Okay, you don't want to change the DAP early on this...
No, not until after I've given 4 seconds of ullage forward.
Okay, I just wanted to verify...
You should be looking for the S-IVB - there goes a panel out there. You can see it drifting out.
Yes, there it is.
There it is, yes. Oh, man. That's beautiful.
What's our range?
What?
Are we within - Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
I'd say it's - Oh, yes, we're real fine, Stu.
Come right on down to - Steady as a rock.
Houston, 14.
Go ahead, Ed.
You should have the television here in a minute. There it comes.
Okay, come right on with that...
Roger. We're not seeing it yet.
shit. It's not quite lined up, damn it. Okay. 1, 2, 3, 4. Okay?
Okay. You doing a...
Roger, Ed. We're getting a great picture now.
Okay.
We can see the drogue down toward the bottom of the picture and slightly left. You might move the camera a little bit left and down about a half a frame.
That's real good. Right there.
Houston, how's the television look to you now? Anything I can do to the picture?
No. I wouldn't change a thing, Ed. Looks really good. It's right in the middle and steady.
Okay.
a little more at it here. I gave it a solid.
Looks to me like you're still closing, Stu.
I'm closing slowly. Now, wait until I get in, and see how it - We've got lots of time.
Going to break the record, man. Take it slowly.
We've already used a little more than I do in the simulator for some reason.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Just for your information, we've lost data with the LVDC. We don't have any procedures for you with regard to that.
Say again, Houston.
We've lost data with - all data from the LVDC, but we have no change in the figures. Go ahead with normal procedures.
Okay.
Houston, 14. Do you need any commentary to help you identify what you're seeing on the TV?
We're - we're picking out things pretty well here. If you have anything for - the rest of the country, you might go ahead and talk if it won't interfere with the operation there.
Okay, I'll chat for a minute. The S-IVB is surrounded here by typical thousands, or millions of particles that came out when we separated. They look like little winking stars, floating around in a very random pattern. The sunlight is shining very strongly off the top of the Lunar Module as we drift into it. Stu's doing an excellent job of sliding in here very slowly. As you can see that - our approach speed is a few tenths of a foot per second, probably. And the LM is starting to get very large in our field of view; starting to cover the window, out my plus-X window. And the LM and the S-IVB are boresighted right out our X-axis. We can see all of the - orange, yellow - thermal protection around the LM. The parts that are black, silver, and white; the colors stand out very nicely. And I can look across - across Stuart.
Hi, Ed, this is Houston. About how far out in range are you now, would you estimate?
About 5 feet.
Roger.
And Houston; we're about to dock.
Roger.
We're probably a foot - 18 inches to 2 foot out now.
Roger.
And we docked.
Roger. We could see a slight oscillation.
Okay, Houston. We hit it twice and - Sure looks like we're closing fast enough. I'm going to back back out here and try it again.
Roger.
Well, there goes the record.
Don't worry about it. Let's get him picked up.
Okay.
Man, we'd better back off here and think about this one, Houston.
Roger.
We're unable to get a capture.
Roger, Ed.
Okay, Houston. We backed out a little bit, and that last time I hit it pretty good and we're just not getting - getting the capture latches in there.
Roger. We suggest you verify, if you haven't already, the docking probe circuit breakers on panel 8.
That's verified.
And - stand by 1.
And, Stu, we suggest you go to Extend on the Docking Probe Extend/Retract switch and check the talkback's gray.
Okay. We did that when we extended them, but we'll sure do it again.
And then back to Retract.
Okay. We get both gray in the Extend position.
Roger.
And we go Retract and both gray.
14, Houston. One other suggestion. Go to panel 229 and check the EPS group 4 circuit breakers.
Okay. They're both in.
Roger.
Houston. We're about out of ideas here. Suggest you verify you got it - the switch back in Retract and then give it another try at docking.
Okay.
Houston, we're starting to drift back in now.
Roger, Ed.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead.
We suggest that at the initial contact that you hold plus-X for 3 seconds or so at least.
Okay, Houston. We tried it before, but not quite 3 seconds.
Okay.
And a good rate coming in this time.
I'm glad we've been through it.
And here we come in again.
Roger.
1, 2, 3, 4 - Son of a bitch - nothing!
Okay, Houston. I hit it pretty good and held 4 seconds on contact and we did not latch.
Roger. We're seeing it all on TV here.
(Sigh) Shit.
one more time.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
For your information, at 3 plus 34:24, a nonpropulsive vent in the booster will be sequenced open. We don't expect to see much from it. Over.
Say that again, please.
At 3 plus 34:24, a nonpropulsive vent in the booster will be sequenced open. Over.
Okay, we got you.
Okay, Houston; 14. I can look in the drogue and I can see three marks 120 degrees apart, like the capture latches are scratching the drogue. They're about - I don't know - inch and a half long going into the hole in the drogue about - spaced about 120.
Roger.
14, Houston. Can you describe the scratches? Are they sharp scratches or rounded off? Over.
Well, I didn't really see that good. I can move back in, I guess. We can take a look at them. They look like fairly distinct - scratches coming into the hole, but - let's move up. We'll take another look.
Roger.
Houston, 14.
Go ahead.
Okay, Gordon. I'm sure you're all thinking along the same lines, but - you know, if the capture latches were depressing as they slide into the drogue, I don't see why they would have made those marks.
Yes, that's been discussed here. We think probably something is holding them out. One possibility is a sort of a shearpin that gets pulled off when the tower is jettisoned and - First look at it looks - We're thinking maybe that may not be - may not allow the capture latches to depress. I guess we'll just have to tell you to stand by while we talk it over here more.
Okay. We're - we're nice and comfortable. And I'm just going to drift around here about this range and try not to use any more fuel than I have to.
Roger. A reminder. You have about 3 minutes until that vent will come open. Keep an eye on that booster when that happens.
Okay. How about you give me a mark on that beauty?
Will do.
Stu, this is Houston. That vent is due in 30 seconds.
Okay.
10 seconds.
Ready...
Mark. It should be on now.
Man, it's beautiful.
We can see one-half of it from here.
Okay, I'll back down a little bit and let you watch this.
There's lightning - the whole sky. Of course, it's the source of another 10 million particles floating out in front of us.
Roger, Ed.
As I was going to say when we were - got busy there a little while ago - look out our left window across Stuart, we could see the Earth receding.
Roger.
Houston, we observe that the S-IVB is slowly rotating, now.
Roger, Ed.
Gordon, how do you read me now?
Loud and clear. Go ahead.
Okay, I'm not sure what we might be doing to the windows. I guess it's a minor problem at this point, but is everybody happy with us sitting here in this vent?
I don't think that point's been raised. Let me ask it around here.
Okay.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead.
While we're working on the problem here, we suggest that you go to a 5-degree deadband in the DAP. That will be a DAP load 11112 to save RCS, and nobody's come up with a good suggestion on what to do about the windows, so I guess we just won't worry about it now.
Ah, Rog. Like I say, I think it's a minor problem.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead.
I'd like you to try one thing. Take the Extend/Retract switch to Retract and tell us what the talkbacks read in Retract as you have on others before.
Okay, Gordon. I - You want the switch in Retract and a read - readout of the talkback?
That's affirmative; while the switch is in Retract.
Rog. It's in Retract now and the talkbacks are gray.
Roger.
Okay. That tells us right there that the capture latches are indeed cocked and that kind of says that there's something in there that's keeping us from releasing them when we go ahead and dock. And it says that we cannot fire bottle.
It just wouldn't fire, is that the true indication? It would not fire. Right?
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Another question. Can you remember back to the initial probe extension, did you hear a thud as though it did extend out?
That's affirmative, Gordon. I guess I should have mentioned that sooner. Yeah. We got the thud and we got the talkbacks on barber pole, then immediately back to gray. But we did feel - feel the thud.
Roger, Stu.
Houston, 14.
14, Houston. Go ahead.
Do you want me to leave the television running or shall I take it down now?
Ah, Stand by. Like to leave it running, Ed. But we're not seeing the booster right now. It's in the lower left corner, just barely. But we'd like to keep it running for a future use.
Okay.
Houston, 14. And turning the Pyros and SECS - and SECS Logic, Off.
Roger.
Apollo 14, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, we'd like to essentially try the docking again with the normal procedures prior to going to more drastic alternate procedures. We'd like you to reconfigure the DAP. R1 should be 11102 for docking. We'd like you to go to Extend/Release and hold it for at least 5 seconds, and then return to Retract and proceed with one more try at a normal docking. Over.
Okay, we'll put a narrow deadband in and we'll go Extend for 5 seconds at least and back to Retract and bang it again.
Roger.
And, 14; Houston. Make your closing rate on this try, not - not fast, not slow, just a normal closing rate.
Okay. We'll try it. I thought that's what I had the first time, but we'll give it a go.
Roger. The first time looked that way to us. We'd just like to try it again.
Okay.
14, Houston. When you go to Extend/Release for the - at least 5 seconds so would you read the talkbacks to us?
Okay.
And, Houston, we'd like to bring SECS Logic, On, and get another Go for pyro arm.
Stand by. We're ready for Logic, On.
Logic is On.
14, Houston. You're Go for pyro arm.
Roger. Go for pyro arm.
Houston, 14. Are you ready for the Extend/Release position of the switch?
That's affirmative. Go ahead, Al.
Okay. Going in Retract, and Extend/Release on my mark. Five seconds.
Mark. My barber pole stayed gray, back to Off. Barber pole's still gray.
Roger; understand.
Back to Retract. Barber pole's still gray.
Roger. I understand the talkback stayed gray all the way through.
Affirmative.
Okay, Houston, we're starting to close on it now.
14, Houston. Roger.
I'm going to tap it one more time.
Okay. That's at least - tap it. Well, I'm going to tap it there. allow a little for the real world.
The alignment is good.
Okay. Okay.
I'm happy with alignment here.
All right. Verified we're in Retract. I'm going.
And done.
About 4 feet out, Houston.
Roger, Ed.
My alignment is good. Stand by.
Here it comes.
No.
No latch.
No; no latch, Houston.
Roger.
Houston, 14. I'm sure you're thinking about the possibility of going hard suit and bringing the probe inside to look at, as we are.
That's affirmative. We may have one more procedure to try prior to going to that. Stand by 1 now.
Okay.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
We'd like some more words on the exact appearance of the drogue, the scratches, and so forth..
Okay, I'll give you - try to give you the best. As I look at the probe - and then you all can figure out where the docking latches are from there; but as I look at the probe in the docking position, the prominent thing - are we have three scratches about - oh, maybe a couple of inches long, and they're really - well, the top one's about - essentially 12 o'clock, maybe 11:30, and then they're spaced, you know, equally around the ring, about 120 out. Now, there is one other scratch that I didn't see before, that I must have put on this last attempt. I noticed it as we backed out, and it - Well, there - there are a couple of other little ones, but the next prominent scratch is, oh, at about the 7 o'clock position. It starts at the hole and runs out for about 3 inches - maybe 4 inches.
Roger.
Houston, all these scratches are radial, and they're right up at the very apex of the drogue.
Roger.
Hey, Stu. This is Gene-o. Do you read?
Yeah, loud and clear.
Okay. We - we got one more idea down here, before doing any hard suit work, and - let me throw it out at you, and you come back with your impressions. We're thinking of - of attempting to - to dock actually without the aid of the probe, which requires some pretty fine alignment. We're thinking that maybe you could go ahead and go through a normal plus-X and put the probe in the drogue, and while you're holding a - This will help you with your alignment - and while you're holding a plus-X, go ahead and blow a bottle and try and retract the probe. Now, if the probe retracts, it should retract well out of your way, so that the - the actual docking latches, with any luck on the alignment, should mate. Now, if you get one latch, we feel we'll - we'll be fast and we can - we can get them all. There's one hooker. The configuration that we think you might be in - electrically, there may be a series path broken which doesn't allow us, actually, to - to retract the probe through blowing one of those bottles. But we feel it sure is worth a chance or, worth a try before - before we do any hard suit work.
Ah, Gene-o. Let me see if we understand you on that. Your - your thought is to blow one of the bottles to retract the probe after we're aligned up and just before contact - or wait until we contact, and then thrusting, and then retract the probe.
Okay, Al. We're - we're thinking that actually, if you use the - Leave the probe extended until you actually contact, that - that any small, minute misalignment, at least in translation left, right, up, or down, will be taken out as the probe centers in the hole of the drogue. If you can keep a plus-X going at that time and then retract the probe, hopefully, your alignment will stay fairly close and - and we may pick up a couple of the docking latches. Now, as I said, we've got some reservations. We're not - we're not sure, actually, if the probe is going to retract, so you might keep that in mind. But again, if it doesn't retract, we haven't lost a bottle, and if it does retract and you - you do get a docking latch, we've accomplished what we wanted to.
Okay. Stand by 1.
Okay, Houston. We'll review what we're going to do for you. See if it is the right thing. Stu is going to make the approach; close at a very slow rate until the initial contact. He's going to call out at that time and apply plus-X. I will then go to the Retract Prime 1 position.
That - that's it, Al. That - That should - should do it if that - that probe does actually retract, and if our alignment is good enough, the possibilities are pretty good of picking up the docking latch.
Okay. You - Your theory is, it is going to retract because you feel the capture latches are locked.
No. I - Actually, the impression here is that it is not going to retract.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. We're on our way in now and we're going to try the plus-X until it's - After its initial contact, try the plus-X until it's settled down for perhaps a second or two and then go through the retract cycle at that time.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. We're about 12 to 15 feet away.
Roger, Ed. We got a very good picture.
About 6 feet out.
About - 2 feet.
About a foot. Here we go.
Okay, Retract.
Nothing happened.
Nothing?
I don't know. I got - got a barber pole. We got a hard dock.
We got some, Houston.
Roger.
I believe we got a hard dock, Houston.
Outstanding.
Okay, Houston, the...
We got it.
We noticed no response for practically 3 seconds after initiating Prime Retract 1. We then got barber pole on both - went gray on both at the hard dock.
Roger, Al. That's great.
Super job, Stu.
Thank you.
It didn't even wiggle when you hit it. Right in there.
Okay. Shall we proceed with the checklist?
14, Houston.
Ah. Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We'd like you to proceed on now with the normal hatch and tunnel procedures.
That's in work, Houston. We'll keep you advised.
And, Houston, I'm turning the TV off now.
Roger, Ed.
14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We want to just verify that you're still all hard suited before proceeding with the - the tunnel procedures...
Not hard suited.
Not hard suited, but completely suited up before proceeding the - the tunnel procedures.
Roger. We will - Roger, Houston. Why don't you review the procedures again as we go down the checklist here, and we'll check with you again when we get to that point. We do watch the cabin pressure pretty closely, you know.
Roger.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Al, can you just give us a - a qualitative feeling of what it sounded like when those docking latches did go? Did you get a - a sort of ripple-bang or are you convinced you got quite a few of them?
Yeah. It was a ripple fire, Gene-o. I'm convinced we did quite a few.
Yeah. That - that sounds pretty familiar, Al. It - it sounds like you're really probably - I wouldn't be a bit surprised to see if you got them all.
Yeah. I think we got quite a few, Gene-o. It looked - It was a good hard dock.
Beautiful. Tell Stu that session he had this morning paid off.
I believe it.
Yes. And we're going to buy him his present from here.
Houston. Delta-P at 2.0. We're starting a - a Delta-P stable check.
Ah, Ed. Would you repeat your last, please.
Rog. We're starting to check the Delta-P for 3 minutes.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 14. We have lost 1/10th of 1 pound per square inch by the Delta-P gauge during the 3-minute period. We'd like to proceed as we are.
Roger, Al. Stand by.
Ah, you're clear to Go with that.
Roger. Proceeding.
Apollo 14, Houston. We'd like you to verify the H2 Fans, Off.
That's verify.
Roger.
Belay that, Houston. They're Off now.
Roger, Ed.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Have some RCS quantity numbers - just - it should make you feel good. You used 131 pounds so far, which is 62 pounds below nominal, but you're still 211 pounds above the redline. Over.
Roger, Houston. We got - We used 131 pounds, which is 62 pounds below nominal. And say again how much above redline?
You're still 211, 211 pounds above the redline.
And, Houston, we got all the docking latches.
Roger. Understand; you got them all. Very good.
Al's checking carefully now, but that's his first report.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. We got all the latches, and everything was fine. All we had to do was just tap on number 2 and 8 to lock the handle down.
Roger, Stu. If you haven't bled the nitrogen with the red button, don't for a minute here.
Oh, you caught us in time. We have not bled it.
Okay. Stand by. I want to make sure that - What EECOM wants to do here.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, after a massive discussion here, we've decided - have you go ahead with the procedures as you see them in your checklist there. Verify the Extend Latch Engaged indicator, not visible, and then go ahead and bleed the GN2.
Wilco.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. In 5 to 10 minutes, the S-IVB fuel pressure should get up to the point where it'll vent. It's through a non-propulsive vent - it shouldn't affect you - much. Over.
Okay, in 5 to 10 minutes. Thank you. And we're just about to put the hatch back in.
Roger.
Houston, 14.
Go ahead, 14.
Okay, Gordon. Is there - just want to make sure that we're all talking on the same frequency on this ejection and - and the maneuvering and everything. Have we got any changes to any of those procedures?
I guess that...
Stand by.
I guess what I'm wondering is - after this long a time, is the S-IVB still in the same condition, and so forth and so on.
Okay, Stu. Stand by. I'll get a good summary of that.
Okay.
Gordon, be advised. We're on page L-37 and ready for pre-LM Sep and ejection.
Roger, Ed.
14, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Essentially, I'd like you to go through procedures and - as you would have nominally. The - the only anomaly with the booster is - right now - is the - that we have lost the downlink from the Launch Vehicle Digital Computer, and so your visual indications of its attitude and maneuvers are the only ones that we'll have. We have no read-out on booster attitude down here. And, actually, we've lost many of the downlink parameters on the booster; however, it shouldn't affect the evasive maneuver and targeting to impact. Over.
Okay, Gordon. That - that - that's what I was wanting to clarify before we pressed ahead so we'll - we'll press right on down and - as nominal and give you the call when we see it and so forth.
Roger.
Okay, circuit breaker SECS Arm, two, closed...
I'm sorry - DET, Reset.
Okay. Wait - wait a minute, baby..
Yes, we sure do.. Let's forget that.
Okay, DET...
No, let's get your last circuit breakers now.
Well, this is the first circuit breaker.
Okay.
DET, Reset.
I've done that.
Circuit breaker SECS Arm, two, closed; verify.
Arm, two, closed; verified.
SECS Logic, two, on (up).
On (up).
You need a Go for pyro arm.
Houston, 14. We'd like a Go for pyro arm, please.
Yes, you have a Go for pyro arm.
Okay.
I guess that was a Go.
SECS Pyro Arm, two, on...
Could have been a No Go.. Okay, the pyros are armed.
TVC Servo Power number 1, AC 1/Main A.
AC 1/Main A.
Arm your RHC...
Give me a mark when you get set.
Houston, we're going for Sep.
Okay, ready for Sep.
3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Okay, Ed?
Roger.
6, 7, 8. Okay.
Okay.
Let's take a look at the 83. Copy down minus 0.7, 0, 0.
Minus...
0.7, 0, and 0.
Cryo Press.
Minus 0.7, 0, at 0.
Okay.
Check the Cryo Press.
Okay, Cryo Press.
These O2 tanks there are closed?
No, I think that's surge tanks...
No, that's the surge tanks.
Okay, there it is. Tank 3. Want the heaters off?
Houston, got a Cryo Press light in the - O2 tank 3.
Look outside, Al, if you want to see something beautiful.
O2 tank 3.
Roger. We're - we estimate that's probably stratification.
Rog. Sorry, that's also tank 1 and 2 that just dropped down.
Look at those big pieces floating around there.
Roger. We saw that.
Really sparkles.
Okay, let's keep us honest, Ed.
Okay, go to P00.
We're at P00.
We've gone to P00.

Okay. I've got the Arms, off; the Logics, Off; and Arm circuit breakers, Open.
Okay. I'm pulling the S-IVB/LM Sep open.
Ready.
Okay. CMC, Auto, Rate 2, and Rate Command...
Okay. And I'm going to verify the O2...
How about our RCS...
Okay. Let's...
No...
check these things off.
Okay.
Okay. We're all gray.

Apollo 14, Houston. We'll be standing by from you for a - that you have the S-IVB visually and a Go for the yaw maneuver.
Okay, Gordon. It's just now coming out from behind the LM for me in the - in the left window here. About another 15, 20 seconds, we ought to have a good view of it.
Roger.
And - Okay, we're well clear, Gordon, if you want to go ahead and do the yaw maneuver at your convenience.
Roger, Stu.
14, Houston. We just sent a checkout command to the booster which looked good. So we're getting ready to start the yaw maneuver now.
Okay. Why don't you give me a mark when it's coming?
All right, will do.
14, Houston. We'll be commanding at 55 plus 30, about 5 seconds from now. Ready...
Mark.
Okay, she - she's moving, Gordon.
Roger, Stu.
Well, Gordon, the maneuver looks like it's going well. She's sure maneuvering away from looking at us, and it's a beautiful sight.
Roger, Stu. It sounds good to us. We had some question about our command capability and it sounds like it's okay.
Oh yeah. She's going away from us.
Apollo 14, Houston. Would you give us Omni Delta?
Okay, you have it, Houston.
Thank you.
Apollo 14, Houston.
Go ahead.
With a Go from you up there, we'll plan to initiate the APS evasive burn at 6 plus 04 even. Over.
Okay. Yeah, it's well boresighted away from us, and we'll be standing by.
Roger.
Apollo 14, Houston. The evasive maneuver should be going now. How does it look?
Rog. We - we see the booster moving.
Roger.
Now the last thing you can do for us on this, because of our lack of determining the booster attitude, is, as it fades out of view - if you can determine if it is still looking stable. Over.
Okay. We can sure handle that, and you got some venting there, too, as you started that maneuver.
Roger. That's normal. I was expecting...
Okay.
Apollo 14, Houston. Would you go to Manual and Wide on the High Gain, but stay in Omni Delta?
You've got it.
Thank you, Ed.
Houston, 14.
Go ahead. Go ahead, 14.
Okay, Gordon. I'm sure - sure you all have been - been talking about it. Do you want me to press ahead with the maneuver to the P52 attitude and go into that?
Roger, Stu. That's affirmative. We'd like you to go through with the normal procedures as shown in the Flight Plan down to that P52 at 5 hours and 40 minutes, but at that point we're going to deviate slightly in order to save some RCS. We would - do not want you to do the fuel cell purge or the waste water dump. We're planning to have you - or - or - and we do not want you to do the - go into PTC. At that point we're planning to do the P23 which will be a little early, and we'll have a new attitude for that. And then we'll go into PTC. Right now it looks like midcourse 1 is not likely to be necessary, so that we'll save one PTC spinup. That way we'll save some RCS. Over.
Okay, now at 5:50 you say, do not do the fuel cell purge or the waste water dump?
That's affirmative, Stu.
Okay, we won't do it.
