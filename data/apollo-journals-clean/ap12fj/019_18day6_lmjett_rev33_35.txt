Intrepid, Houston. How do you read?
Read you loud and clear.
Roger. Yankee Clipper, how do you read?
Houston, loud and clear.
Roger; read you both the same. [Pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Pete, are you in the Clipper now?
Pete's - Pete's reading the checklist to Al. Hey, Jerry, I got a question.
Go.
Pete wants to know if he can leave his LCG in the LM.
Okay, Dick. Stand by. We'll get an answer on that. I got a couple of questions for them - would you relay them?
Yes, I can, Jerry. They're going through their checklists, so they can get out of it.
Okay. Here's our - here's our questions...
[Garble] ask the questions.
...You know that hanging metal they were talking about on the Service Module? We're wondering if that's in a position such that it might possibly be the cause of our S-band antenna problem, causing it to dither.
It's further up than that - it's right around the SEP plane of the service module, and it's right on the top of Dick Gordon, whereas his S-band antenna's on his bottom left, if you go relative to the upper windows.
Okay. We copy that, and the other one is, don't forget to bring the LM TV camera across.
We've already got it, and it's stowed on the Command Module, and we put it in one of those special bags because it had a lot of dust on it.
Roger. Good.
Hey, and also, Houston, we need to know if we can just go ahead and leave our LCG's here, or do you want them brought back?
We're checking on that now, Pete.
Clipper, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. High Gain antenna's not doing too well. We'd like you to go Manual, and your angles are pitch, minus 4l; yaw, 4. Over.
Intrepid. Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. On your LCG question, the only problem we have right now is in the area of contamination. We're giving it a quick checkout on that and we'll have an answer for you in just a few minutes.
Say again, Houston.
Intrepid, Houston. The only problem that - the question mark we have with the LCG being left in the LM is the contamination thing. We're getting an okay on it, and we will get back with you in just a couple minutes.
Understand. [Long pause.]
P30 looked good, Al.
Clipper, Houston. I have a CSM DAP load for you and a map update for Rev 34. [Pause.]
Go ahead, Jerry.
Okay, Dick. Your CSM weight is 35,634. I've got your trim angles anytime you need them. Your map update is Rev 34; LOS is 148:24:47, 148:2 - correction, 49:43, 149:11:01.
Roger. I copy that, and the CSM weight is 35,634.
Affirmative, Dick.
Intrepid, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. You can leave those LCG's in the LM if you want to, and let us know where you stowed them, would you?
Will do.
We're going to leave them in the CSM ditty bag which will be on the floor.
Okay, fine.
Intrepid, Houston.
Hello.
Roger. Have you got your master alarm circuit breaker closed?
It's open.
Okay, Dick.
What would you like, Houston?
No, that's fine the way it is.
Is it okay? Okay.
Hello, Houston; Clipper.
Roger, Clipper. Go.
Do you want to send something to the LM to see if the uplink is okay? How about a Verb 47?
Stand by just a second, Dick. [Long pause.]
Clipper, Houston. We're going to send an Error Reset.
Yankee Clipper; this is Houston. Intrepid is Go; you can clear it out any time.
Roger. We've been trying to.
Houston, Clipper. How about a Pyro Arm? Here comes, the Logic, On, for you.
Roger, Clipper.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Go for Pyro Arm.
Roger. Go for Pyro Arm.
Houston, Clipper. Two minutes to Jettison.
Roger, Clipper.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Go to Reacq on the High Gain. Over.
Roger.
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Houston, Clipper. Go.
Roger. Your High Gain's beginning to jitter again. Better go Manual, and your angles in the Flight Plan are good. That's minus 36 on the pitch and 352 on the yaw.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Hello.
Pete, the surgeon has some words for you about your sensors - sensor irritation, if you want to listen to that.
Why don't you stand by until they get some coffee?
Roger.
Apollo 12, Houston. [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Houston. Omni Bravo, please. [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Houston in the blind. Omni Bravo, please. [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Houston. [Pause.]
Hello, Houston; 12. Go ahead.
Roger. We recommend that you shut off the High Gain. First, put the Track switch on Manual; next, put the High Gain Power switch to Off, and talk to us through Omni - we assume you're on Omni Bravo. We think that should be a good one.
Your assumption is correct. [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Houston. Everything looks in good shape down here. Also, the LM looks in good status for the deorbit burn.
Apollo 12, Houston. We show about 45 seconds to LOS. You'll be coming around the corner at 149:11.
Roger, Don. Thank you.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Apollo 12, Houston. Apollo 12, Houston.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Apollo 12, Houston. [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Houston in the blind. For your information, for P20 tracking of the LM with the sextant, you'll get a program alarm 20430 when the LM vector intersects the surface. With a Verb 66 Enter and reset the alarm, you'll clear that. Impact time at the surface should be 149 plus 55 plus 59. That's when you should get the alarm 20430, and it's only the LM vector passing through the surface.
Hello, Houston; Yankee Clipper.
Loud and clear. How are you doing, Dick?
Apollo 12, Houston.
Doing pretty good. I've got the LM in the sextant. And I've been tracking him, and I've got the camera [garble] right now watching the LM. What time is that burn scheduled for?
Okay. The burn ignition time is 149 plus 28 plus 14. Did you get a transmission from us in the blind about 2 minutes ago about a program alarm?
Negative.
Roger. If you're going to track in P20, which we see you're setting up for, when the LM vector intersects the lunar surface, you will get a program alarm 20430. When you go Verb 66 and Enter and put your vector in that slot deal and Reset, the alarm should go away. Now, the impact time is expected to be 149 plus 55 plus 59.
Okay, fine. Thank you.
Roger. We've got some other goodies for you. We've got a P40 maneuvering PAD, when you're ready to copy; we've got some words for Pete about his skin irritation; we've got consumables PADs and a few other things when you want them.
[Garble], Don. I'm trying to track this LM while these guys are still packing the spacecraft.
Apollo 12, we're not reading you very well on that last transmission. Could you give that again?
Give what again, Don?
Your last transmission. You were breaking up.
I said you'd better hold all that stuff awhile. Pete and Al are trying to pack this spacecraft, yet, with all the stuff they brought back from the LM; and I'm trying to track the LM itself. So we won't have time for anything else right now.
Very good. We'll hold it.
Apollo 12, Houston. One minute to LM ignition.
Roger.
Apollo 12, Houston. The LM is on its way down.
Roger [garble]. [Long pause.]
Houston, 12.
Go, 12.
Is the LM still burning?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Houston; this is 12. Let me know when he finishes burning. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 12.
Houston, go ahead.
Roger. Will you let me know when he's through with the burn, please?
Say again, 12.
Will you call and let me know when the LM finishes its burn?
Okay, it has finished its burn now. It's been over about a minute and a half.
Thank you.
Apollo 12, Houston. We show just under 20 minutes until; LM impact.
Apollo 12, Houston. We've computed a new impact time for the LM impacting the surface at l49 plus 55 plus 17.
Roger.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 12.
Go ahead, 12.
Roger, Don. Let's get caught up on some of those PADs. Let me know when that thing impacts, so I can shut off this camera, because I can't see it through the telescope?
Roger. We've got 6 minutes to impact, and I've got a P40 TEI PAD for you.
Okay. Go with the TEI PAD.
Roger. TEI-39, SPS/G&N: Noun 47 is 35629; Noun 48 is minus 0.67, plus 0.44; GET 160:42:19.26; Noun 81, plus 3463.6, plus 0671.1, minus 0128.2; roll, NA; pitch, 109; yaw, NA; all the rest is NA; ullage, four jets, 11 seconds; and this assumes no plane change 2.
Okay. Copy TEI PAD 39. SPS/G&N is 35629; minus 0.67, plus 0.44; 160:42:19.26; plus 3463.6, plus 0671.1, minus 0128.2; pitch is 109; four jet, 11 seconds; no plane change 2.
That's affirmative.
Does Pete want to hear some recommendations from the Flight Surgeon on his skin irritation?
No, he doesn't need any information on that.
Okay. I've got a consumable PAD for you, if you want it.
You've got some what? [Pause.]
Don, say again. You were cut out.
Roger. We've got a consumable update for you. RCS total is 47.6, Alfa is 46.4, Bravo is 48.7, Charlie is 46.4, Delta is 48.7, and we show 2 minutes and 38 seconds to LM impact.
Okay. Understand. And would you tell me when I should start on the secondary pro - propellants? On the secondary fuel.
Roger. [Long pause.]
12, we'll get an estimate on that for you.
Countdown for LM impact. 3, 2, 1...
Mark.
LM impact.
Okay, thank you. [Long pause.]
Houston, Apollo 12.
Go.
Would you like to take the E-memory dump?
That is affirmative.
It's on its way.
Roger.
And, Don, we want to report the crew status report. Everybody is feeling fine. No medication today. There's been enough excitement.
Very good. Copy that.
And the onboard readouts, Houston - the onboard readouts - those three batteries are still at 37.1. And the rest of our transmission has been taken care of.
We got 37.1. Will you give us the end of that?
That's all three of my batteries. Battery C, Pyro A, and Pyro B.
Roger. Understand fox all batteries. Also would you give us a word about the CO2 cartridge, secondary? We were wondering why you'd gone to Secondary, if you had any other trouble on that? Apollo 12, that was the LM cartridge we were talking about. If you'd had another glitch on the CO2 sensor. [Long pause.]
And, Don, since our High Gain is acting up like it is, do you want us to go Omni - Omni Bravo tonight?
This is affirmative. Omni Bravo. That's Omni Bravo when you configure for sleep, and we'd like you to put the normal S-band voice to Off at that time."
Roger.
One question. We were wondering if the sequence camera had been wrapped when you stowed it for - to prevent damage. Your choice as to where you want to stow it.
Apollo 12, would you hold what you have on attitude until we finish this E-Mod dump? [Long pause.]
Dick, for the RCS, we're 25 pounds on each quad above the level at which we'd open the secondary. So, things are okay there.
Okay. I won't worry about it tonight.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, for your information, all the surface experiments for ALSEP are in great shape. They're all operating very well. There is apparently no temperature degradation at all because of any dust. So, that looks like that came out real fine. The passive seismic is working fine. It - noticed Pete walk past. Also got a very nice trace for your Lift-Off. On the LM impact, we were probably about 40 nautical miles away. So, the short period didn't get anything, but it looks like the long period got a couple of signals. Also, the cold cathode gage could see the sublimator walking past, Pete, when you went over to check the SIDE experiment, and all the other experiments are working fine. So everybody is absolutely delighted with the way you deployed the ALSEP. The passive did record the impact on long period.
Apollo 12, Houston. Before you close out the LEB, we'd like to just remind you to zero the optics, and we'd like you to leave the power on so that we can watch the CDU's [Coupling Data Unit] tonight. We've seen just a couple of glitches, and we just want to follow through on that and see how they're doing.
They're doing fine.
Very good.
Roger.
Apollo 12, Apollo 12. If you read, would you give us Omni Bravo. Omni Bravo.
Apollo 12. If you read, give us Omni Bravo. Omni Bravo.
Apollo 12, Apollo 12, Omni Bravo, Omni Bravo.
Apollo 12, Houston. Apollo 12, Houston. Could you give us Omni Bravo? Omni Bravo.
Apollo 12, Houston. We show about 3 minutes to, LOS; if you could give us Omni Bravo, we would appreciate it. Omni Bravo.
Apollo 12, Apollo 12, Houston. We show 2 minutes from LOS. We would like Omni Bravo, if you could. Omni Bravo. [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Houston. We show 1 minute from LOS. If you read us, would you give us - Omni Bravo. Omni Bravo.
Apollo 12, Houston. Apollo 12, Houston. Apollo 12. Mode Brav - Omni Bravo, please. [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Houston in the blind. Would you give us Omni Bravo, Please? Omni Bravo. [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Houston. Would you give us Omni Bravo, please? [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Apollo 12. This is Houston. Do you read?
Apollo 12, Apollo 12. This is Houston. Do you read? [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Apollo 12, Houston. Do you read? [Pause.]
Dick, if you can read us, would you give us Omni Bravo, please? Omni Bravo. [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Apollo 12. This is Houston. Do you read? [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Apollo 12. This is Houston on guard. If you read, rock your wings. Give us Omni Bravo, please.
Apollo 12, Apollo 12. This is Houston. Do you read us? [Pause.]
Apollo 12, Houston. Try Omni Bravo, if you read us, please. [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Houston. Apollo 12, Houston. Do you read us? Omni Bravo, if you read, please.
Apollo 12, Apollo 12, Houston. This - this is Houston. Do you read us? If you read us, please give us Omni Bravo. Omni Bravo.
Apollo 12, Houston. Apollo 12, Houston. Do you read? [Pause.]
Apollo 12, Houston; Apollo 12, Houston. Would you give us Omni Bravo, turn up your S-band voice? [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Houston. Do you read us? [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Houston. Apollo 12, Houston. Do you read? [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Apollo 12, this is Houston. Do you read? [Pause.]
Apollo 12, Apollo 12. In the blind. Give us Omni Bravo, please.
Apollo 12, this is Houston. Do you read us? [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Houston. [Pause.]
Apollo 12, this is Houston. Do you read us? [Pause.]
Hello, Houston; hello, Houston; Apollo 12.
Hello, Apollo 12.
What do you want?
We were just a little concerned about letting you go for 8 hours without any Comm. We're sorry to interrupt your sleep, but now we've got you back in Comm, so we're just going to wish you a good night and sorry for the interruption.
Okay. We're not sleeping. We're all just trying to get clean in here; so, we had the Comm off. We'll be back with you after a while. Don't panic.
Roger. No problem. It's just that we had no TM or anything. We didn't want you to go to sleep before we got a hold of you.
