Hello, Houston, Apollo 12.
Good morning, Pete.
Hello, 12. Houston here.
Hello, Houston; Hello, Houston. Apollo 12. Over.
Good morning, Pete.
Morning.
You have everybody up and about there?
Everybody's up.
They give you a crew status report.
I thought we just had it, but go ahead.
Okay. Everybody had 8 hours of sleep, and the PRDs for the CDR is 11005; for the CMP, 11005; for the LMP, 04006.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 12, Houston. If you want to go ahead and stir your cryos, we can get good H2 and O2 readout for your consumables update.
Okay, that's in work.
A couple of words on your RCS, Pete. We're running a little behind the curve, a total of about 60 pounds low. We are recommending that you perform your maneuvers at your option at either 0.2-degree a second or minimum impulse in an attempt to reduce RCS usage. Over.
Roger.
12, Houston. Ready with your morning newscast if you are.
Okay. Go.
Okay. Whoever answered me that time was way down in the mud and hardly readable. World attention is on the flight of Apollo 12. The Soviet Union held the crew as courageous; and Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported the start of the mission and a brief factual report in both of its Russian and foreign language reports. Czechoslovak television carried a live coverage of the lift-off, complete with an explanation of technical details. In West Germany, all radio and television networks carried the launch live, as did the Japanese Broadcasting Company. The launch is being described by such adjectives as "spooky" and "cliff hanging." Even President Nixon, a one-time Navy man himself, admitted he had some anxious moments but added, "I'm really proud of those three men up there." Weather is a news item in Houston where temperatures are expected to dip into the 20s tonight. Automobile owners are being advised to put anti-freeze in their car radiators. Today's a voting day in Houston as Houston picks a mayor, eight councilmen, four school-board members, and decides upon a number of special issues. In sports, Houston Oiler Woody Campbell ended rumors and speculation yesterday by strolling into the Oiler training room and putting on his uniform. He says he's in good shape after 10 months as an MP with the First Infantry Division in Vietnam and hopes to be in action very soon. We're working up some ball scores for you; the only one available right now is a halftime score, it's Ohio State 28 and Purdue 7.
Houston, 12. Right at the end of the reports on Apollo 12, we changed the antennas. Did you want to relay some stuff up between that and the election in Houston? If so, would you repeat it?
Okay. Yes, I got several paragraphs in there. Let me start over again and I'll read it on down to where - the election in Houston. World attention is on the flight of Apollo 12. The Soviet Union held the crew as courageous; and Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported the start of the mission in a brief factual report in both of its Russian and foreign language reports. Czechoslovak television carried live coverage of the lift-off, complete with explanation of technical details. In West Germany, all radio and television networks carried the launch live, as did the Japanese Broadcasting Company. The launch is being described with such adjectives as "spooky" and "cliff hanging." Even President Nixon, a one-time Navy man himself, admitted he had some anxious moments but added, "I'm really proud of those three men up there." And weather is a big news item in Houston where temperatures are expected to dip into the 20's tonight, and there was a fairly heavy frost in the neighbourhood last night. And then we picked up with the voting, which I guess you got.
Roger-Roger. Thank you.
And I got a Flight Plan update when you have a chance.
Go ahead.
Okay, Dick. At 30:30, we call for a waste water dump, which is back to our normal procedure of dumping down to 25 per cent on that one. And at 31:30, want to start a charge on battery Alpha. Over.
Roger. We copy.
Waste water dump 30:30, 25 per cent. Battery A charge, 31:30.
Roger.
12, Houston. Your PCO2 sensor is powered through a circuit breaker on panel 5. If you haven't already checked it, would you check Transducer Pressure Group 2; Main Alpha circuit breaker?
Okay. Wait one.
They're all in, Houston.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 12. How far out are we now?
Stand by and I'll find out for you, Al.
12, Houston. Not quite halfway at a 110,000 miles.
Roger.
12, Houston. Omni Delta, please.
12, Houston. We'll continue to manage your antenna here until you tell us that you're ready to take control of them. And I have a consumables update for you.
Okay, Houston. We're eating breakfast, so we'll let you manage them for a while longer, and I'm ready to copy the update.
Okay. The update was at 26:50; your total RCS is 83.2; reading Alpha through Delta, we have 80.5, 86.0, 80.8, 85.4. Your H2 is 87.8 and 85.6; O2 is 87.0 and 87.1. Over.
Roger. 12 copies.
Houston, 12.
Go ahead, 12.
You got anything more to add to what happened yesterday? We've been sitting up here chuckling again this morning about it.
Stand by and I'll get a recap on it, Pete.
12, Houston. Nothing new to report. It's - they're still considering it from two, three aspects, but nothing firm yet.
Okay.
12, Houston. We've got a half dozen or so scores of all games in progress, if you're interested.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. Final score, Syracuse beat Navy 15 to nothing; in the third quarter, Yale is leading Princeton 14 to 7; in the first quarter, Texas 21, TCU nothing. In the third quarter, Houston's ahead of North Carolina State 34 to 7; in the third quarter, Michigan State is leading Minnesota 7 to nothing; and that big game in the Big 10, in the third quarter, it's now Ohio State 40 and Purdue 7.
Okay. Thank you.
Paul, this is Dick. I understand that the University of Washington's homecoming's this weekend; will you wish them well for me, please?
Okay. Sure will. We'll pass that on.
Sounds like I should have wished Princeton well a little earlier; maybe it's not too late.
No, it's only in the first quarter. Maybe it will still work.
Okay.
And I guess Texas doesn't need any help.
Apparently not.
Hello, 12; Houston. We're not trying to press you, but we've got your uplinks and your PADs ready whenever you're ready.
Okay. We'll give you the computer right now, and - and Al will be ready to copy the PAD in just a second.
Okay. And also, for information, the burn attitude for MCC-2 will also be a good attitude for P52 and for all your star checks, if you want to come out of PTC and just go right to that attitude.
Okay. That sounds good. Ready to copy, and the computer is yours. It's in P00 and Accept, and Al's ready to copy.
Rog. It's MCC-2, SPS G&N: 63284, plus 0.96, minus 0.25, 030:52:43.68, minus 0060.1, minus 0012.6, plus 0005.6, 034, 095, 333. The Noun 44 blocks are not applicable; 0061.7, 0:09, 0057.2. Sextant star 22, 150.5, 30.9. Your boresight star is Vega, 036, up 250, 0 deflection, up and down that is - correction, left and right. The rest of the PAD is NA. Your GDC align stars are Sirius, 15; Rigel, 12. The angles are 256, 152, 069; no ullage; LM weight, 33585. Over.
Okay, Houston. That's 63284, plus 0.96, minus 0.25, 030:52:43.68, minus 0060.1, minus 0012.6, plus 0005.6, 034, 095, 333, NA, NA, 0061.7, 0:09, 0057.2, 22, 150.5, 30.9. Vega, 036, up 250, 00. Set stars are Sirius, 15, and Rigel 12; 256, 152, 069; no ullage; LM weight 33585.
That's all of Charlie, Al.
12, Houston. The computer's yours.
Roger.
12, Houston. You want some more ball scores, Dick, or are you busy?
Go ahead.
Okay. Sorry, Pete; it didn't work. The final score was Yale 17, Princeton l4. And for Al, Texas is leading TCU at the half 24 to 7; Washington, they haven't started on the West Coast. In the fourth quarter, fourth quarter that is, Pitt is leading Army 12 to 6. Dave's next to me; he just cringed at that. A final, Penn State beat Maryland 48 to nothing. Final, Houston beat North Carolina State 34 to 13. Here's a big one. In the third quarter, Mississippi is leading Tennessee 31 to nothing. The final in the Ohio State-Purdue game, Ohio State on top, 42 to l4. Minnesota beat Michigan State 14 to 10. In the first quarter, Arkansas is leading SMU l4 to 12. At half, Rice is leading A&M 7 to nothing. And that's all we have for now.
Okay. Appreciate it very much. Thank you.
Hello, 12; Houston. You're Go for MCC-2.
Apollo 12. Roger.
Houston, Apollo 12. The LM/CSM Delta-P is plus 0.7.
Houston. Roger.
12, Houston. I have some High-Gain angles for you for the burn.
Okay, Houston. Go.
Okay. That will be pitch minus 85, yaw plus 28, and when you get to the burn attitude, would you give us narrow beam width, please?
Okay. Pitch minus 85, yaw plus 28, and while we're in the burn attitude, go to narrow beam width.
Roger.
And as soon as we roll around on this one to the right roll angle, we'll be going into the P52, Houston.
Houston. Roger.
12, Houston. Give us Omni Bravo, please.
Hello, 12, Houston. Over.
Hello, Apollo 12, Houston. Over.
Go ahead there, Houston.
Okay, on this - You've got a pretty tight LM, and it is going to have to be purged some. We have got two options. The Flight Plan calls for a CSM purge at 36 hours. The other option is to vent the LM down now. Instead of doing that, the pros and cons are that the cabin purge, the CSM cabin purge takes longer, and does slightly perturb the post-burn tracking. Now, all of other things being equal, and if it meets with your approval, we would like to request that you vent the LM down now. Over.
Okay. Roger. How far do you want it vented?
This is Houston. You are broken. Say again.
How far do you want it vented?
Okay. We would like to vent to a Delta-P of about 1.5 to 1.6. This should take about 30 to 45 minutes to go from the present 0.7 to those values. Over.
Houston, okay. Are you looking at the DSKY?
That's affirmative.
Okay. There's the torquing angles. Do you copy?
We have only got one so far. There they come. We have them, Dick.
Okay. Torquing on my mark.
Mark.
Got it.
Hello, Apollo 12, Houston. I have a status report on the Phoenix 200 if you want it, Pete.
Okay. Al Unser is leading after 59 laps. Mario Andretti is second. Bobby Unser is third. A. J. Foyt was forced out of the race. My information doesn't indicate when. He was running with the leaders and his car was damaged in a collision. There were no injuries.
Roger-Roger.
Houston. Apollo 12. The lithium hydroxide canister change out has been done on time.
Roger 12. Thank you, and your platform looks real good. No updates.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 12, Houston. A hot flash on the Phoenix 200. Al Unser and Mario Andretti collided with each other and Bobby Unser is now in the lead.
Okay. Very good.
Hello, 12, Houston. A correction to my last update on the Phoenix 200. That collision was between Marlo Andretti and Bobby Unser. Al Unser still has the lead.
Okay. Very good. Do you know how far along they are in the race?
No, we don't know right now, Pete. We will get it for you.
Okay.
12, Houston. Can you give us a readout on the LM/Command Module Delta-P now, please?
Okay. Just a second, let me go up there. I had a clock running for a while, and I was just going to check it in a minute.
We just want to get a check on the rate.
Okay. It's about 1.25 to 1.3 right now.
Roger, understand. And here on the ground, we're configured for TV.
Okay. We're just setting it up in here, and the - we'll go back to LM tunnel Vent. You want to go to 16, right?
That's affirmative. Between 1.5 and 1.6.
Okay. It's back at Vent.
Roger.
Houston, you want the TV now?
Stand by, Pete.
While we're getting a reading on the TV, Pete, they stopped the race in Phoenix after 84 laps because of rain, if you can believe it; and they're going to wait a while and then restart when it slacks off.
Okay. Thank you.
12, Houston. We're ready for a TV whenever you are, Pete.
Okay. We'll be coming at you in just a second.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. We're giving you the TV. We'll be coming up Vox, and we'll let you watch what happens during the burn.
Roger.
Okay, I guess I'm on Vox now. I've got to stow this helmet stowage bag. I'll stick it in this container A7 here.
No, not in A7.
B30.
Okay, Dick, I don't think your Vox is set quite right yet. Need some more sensitivity. Use the plug all the way.
Okay.
Let me get the big book.
Pre-burn checks; 30 hours, 52 minutes, 43.68 seconds.
Plus 5.6.
Okay. Got the TV yet, Houston?
Roger, 12. Looks beautiful.
Okay. We're just going through the pre-burn checklist at this time. Al's down in the bilge stowing some gear for the burn. Dick's in the left-hand couch, and I'm in the center couch right now, and we have the TV mounted so that you can watch the instrument panel and the switches throwing.
Roger, Pete.
Okay, let's see. The clock's in Sync now.
They're in Sync 34, 27, and 25.
Houston, do you want us to run the tape recorder during this TV or not?
Stand by.
We're concerned about the high bit rate while operating the TV.
12, Houston. Better run the tape just during the burn.
Okay.
We had the automatic stop on.
Al, would you take the monitor and put it some place for a second? And Dick, hand me the
Put it over here.
tool E, so I can go up and check the Delta-P in the LM again.
Okay, yes.
Okay, we've got just a little bit to go.
Got all your shoulder straps tucked away where they won't go anywhere?
We're at 1.4 on these water bags. Need a drink of water, Dick?
Got it.
Okay.
Well, let's see, we got to do something with the water gun. Let's stick her down here.
Can't, with that thing on, can you?
Uh-uh. Not unless it would go in backwards, which it will.
That's super.
There you go.
I'll hold on to tool E. I'm gonna - I'm gonna shut-off the vent a minute anyhow.
We're almost there. If the our stowage bag falls off the wall, we're going to have garbage all over the place.
Okay. There's another one.
Great Scott.
Okay.
Got the DAP, 11 loaded?
DAP's loaded. Rot Control Power, two of them, AC/DC.
AC/DC.
DET is set.
It's set.
And we have several choices. You can either go to P40, or we can sit where we are, or you can go over to P00.
Might as well sat here for a few minutes, I guess, and watch the clock, and see how they do.
Deadly TV monitor keeps floating around here. Get her and put her out of the way.
Okay.
Well, let me check that LM Delta-P again.
No not quite.
Okay. Now, weren't we flowing some O2 before? Wonder why we're doing it now?
We haven't opened anything. You got any of the vents open down there, Al?
Let me check. I don't think so. I don't think we're flowing anything.
Everything's closed in here and the Delta-P...
No, it's in tunnel vent, I'm venting the LM down.
No, not a thing is venting as far as I can see.
Oh, you just may be making up some in the cabin.
Do you see anything loose, now?
I think I've got it all stowed.
Very good.
Trouble is, some of those things hang up in under the seats and float so still that you don't see them. Think they're part of the seat or something. You're not used to looking in those places on Earth.
Okay. We got 30 minutes to the burn.
All righty.
Set 10 minutes on your little ding-ding timer there, will you, Al. And then fasten it to that tunnel vent so I don't forget. it.
All right.
Give all these circuit breakers a quick cage.
Go for the burn, time is 9 seconds; to shut-down is burn time plus one, and we trim x to within two tenths, less than 2.
Did we ever dump the waste water down to 25 per cent?
No. We can do that right now. Okay, waste water dump coming up. Hey, Al, you want to check - want to watch the gauge?
Okay.
Okay.
And Houston, we're going to dump the waste water down to 25 per cent at this time.
Roger, 12. We're standing by.
Okay, check - Okay, vent valve is closed, and I'm going to dump A.
Okay.
There you go.
You got 50 per cent, around there, about 49.
Okay.
Huh?
I need the Auto dump vent B system book.
Pete's got it.
Okay, I'm going to - I'm reading 1 point - Houston, I'm reading 1.5 on the LM Delta-P now, but I think I'll let it go to 1.6 because the gauge has about a tenth error in it when it's equal.
Okay, Pete, that sounds fine.
How is the waste water doing, Al?
It's doing good. It's just down to about 45.
Okay. Say, how's the focus on the TV? We usually don't become focused on this monitor up here.
Hey, Houston, what do you think of the hats our boss presented with us?
We were just going to ask you for a little fashion show here, troops.
Well, we've got a space - qualified beta clothes and all those good things.
Roger. CapCom has one, too.
Outstanding. Have you got a propeller on yours?
No. Just one guy's got a propeller.
that's what I figured.
I'm just like you guys.
How's the waste water, Al?
It's good. It's
How much is it?
14 per cent.
Okay.
It sure is spraying outside. It looks like a snowstorm.
Okay. Did you mean to leave this storage box open?
Yes, I've got something I want to put in there.
Okay.
Hand me a towel, would you, Pete?
Here you go.
Okay. Slip up into the tunnel, and let's look at the Delta-P again. Just a smidge more. Okay.
How's the waste water?
Waste water is running. It's now at 31.
Very good.
Very good.
I'm all done.
Al, if you will jump back in here, we can get the P40 checklist.
Okay. I will be right with you as soon as the waste water is down, and I'll get the LM squared away, and that's it.
Still 31 - now it's moving down of the water is up at 95.
It's about 29 now.
Okay. One towel back where it belongs. Okay. That's 25 per cent. Shut her down.
Waste water down, Pete.
Okay. Waste water coming off. Pressure relief is from dump A back to 2, potable inlet is coming open.
There you go.
That's it. Now, once you square away the LM, I that's good enough, it ought to be just about 1.6.
I'll get this in the stowage compartment.
There we go. LM/CM Delta-P and, Houston, it's reading now 1.6, exactly.
Okay. There I come.
Roger. 12. You can terminate.
Okay. Let's put the tool over there. Now, let me up in my belt. Now adjust. Okay.
There you are.
All right the whole works.
Give Al one. He can have the PAD, I guess.
Okay, Al, I'll let you have the PAD.
Okay.
Got easy?
Okay, want to cycle into P00 and P40 and bring everything up to speed.
Okay. We're down to 20 minutes.
Okay.
We're in P00 and P40.
Okay.
P40 and those angles look good, 337.30, 095.24, 332.52.
Okay. Let's go there.
All right. Going on maneuver. Yes. There it goes. This reminds me of riding in a freight train.
Freight train, freight train, going so fast.
Okay, we're there.
All right.
Burn attitude.
Now, you've got the 50, 18 and Auto. We have checked the stars. Okay. I'll run the checklist to minus 6 minutes.
The GDC's aligned.
Okay.
All right. Panel 8 circuit breakers, Stab Control System 8 of them closed.
Stab Control, 8 closed.
CB SPS, 12 of them closed.

We've got about 12 minutes to go, Al, to bus ties.
How's that focus, Houston?
Apollo 12, Houston. Focus is just a shade fuzzy now. It was better earlier.
Okay. I'll move in a little bit. How's that?
How's that?.
It's getting worse now.
Wrong way.
Now, it's improving. No, you went through it.
Here, I'll hold that for you.
Okay.
Looks like an eye exercise.
How's that look now, Houston?
It's pretty good now, 12. It's still not as good as it was at first.
I can't understand why.
Friendly tuning fork again
Yes. That's how I get around the spacecraft. I turn on my propeller.
Apollo 12, contact.
Roger-Roger.
I'll hold this for a while?
Sure, just stick it up there somewhere.
Okay, I'll put it on the
Okay, Houston. 15 minutes.
Roger, 12.
Al, I'll give BMAG back in about 3 or 4 seconds after the burn.
Okay.
It's only 9 seconds long.
Okay-dokey.
Looks like that S-IVB really did the job yesterday, didn't it?
Sure takes a long time for - whenever you dump anything, it sure takes a long time for it to dissipate out there. It really hangs with us.
Might mention to you, Houston, we've been all been enjoying the food very much. It's a lot better than Gemini.
Real fine, Pete.
Nice to have hot coffee this morning.
Apollo 12, Houston. I'll be giving you a 10-minute time hack in about a minute and a half.
Okay. Standing by.
It's a good move, Jerry, with the way our clocks are up here.
Yeah. When Dick's up here by himself, this mission timer we have on the panel 2 has been virtually useless. It changes time both plus and minus, and it's just not working at all right.
Roger.
The one down in the LEB, one down in the LEB is keeping pretty good time
30 seconds to go.
Okay. It looks like we're pretty well in Sync with you.
I'm going to give you 1-second lead so it will be 10 when it gets there.
Okay.
Stand by for 10. Two.
Mark.
Right, 10 minutes; we're right with you. After the burn, we're going to clean up the spacecraft, and I think the three of us will shave. And then want to do some exercise with the exerciser, and I suspect that will occupy most of the rest of the day.
Roger
Get my hand out of the way there. Holding the books up here.
Seems like those upper thrusters, you can hear them fire; it's the lower ones that you can never hear.
I don't know what it is, but it's on top of the insulation of the quad supports.
Oh, yes, I saw yesterday.
They're discolored.
No, they were that way yesterday.
They were?
Yes. It look like you dropped a drop of oil on water. It's multicolored. Yes. I noticed that yesterday.
You think it's some heating from our RCS thrusters, or what?
I don't think so. I don't think we've been firing them that way. They might of done it yesterday.
It wasn't there at launch, or when we first picked up the LM.
Okay. Coming up on 7 minutes, and we'll pick up the checklist at minus 6.

Helium and Nitrogen all look okay.
All righty.
Tank pressures look good.
Mark - 1 minute.
Sit over here where I can watch the clock for you.
DSKY's blank.
Average g; EMS Mode is...
EMS is Normal.
Okay. There is no ullage. You're clear to proceed in 5 seconds.
Standing by on the Pro
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, flashing 99 to Pro, 2, 1...
Ignition.
Thrust.
I got ball valve A.
Okay...
other ball valve.
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 seconds...
Shutdown.
I got all ball valves off; compressors are okay.
B bank's Off, A bank's Off.
Very, good.
Watch the gimbals.
I'm watching them...
The gimbals are...
Okay. Yaw 2 is Off.
It's Off.
Pitch 2, Off.
It's Off.
Yaw 1, Off.
It's Off.
Pitch 1, Off.
It's Off. Okay?
Okay. Let me run the checklist, now.
Moves out. doesn't it?
Yes. Delta-V A and B switches, Off.
They're Off.
SPS injector valves, all Closed.
They're Closed.
SPS Helium Valves, all Closed. Right?
Right.
Gimbal motors, four of them, Off.
They're all Off.
TVC Servo Power 1 and 2, Off.
1 and 2 are Off.
Okay. Main Bus Ties, two of them, Off.
Coming Off.
And there's the...
They're Off.
Yes, okay. Minus 1, minus 3, and plus or minus a tenth.
Is that our thrusters?
Yes, yes. Dick's trimming. That's it. Minus a tenth.
Trim is minus 0.1; EMS reads minus 2.2.
Okay. You got the Bus Ties, Off?
They're Off.
Okay. Null residuals - it was done - and did you give them the EMS counter?
Yes.
That's affirmative. We copy.
EMS Function - Okay, EMS mode, Standby.
Standby and Off.
Limit Cycle, On.
Limit Cycle's On.
Att Deadband, Max.
Max.
Trans Control Power, Off.
Trans Control Power's Off.
ROT Control Power Direct, two of them, Off.

BMAG modes, three of them to Rate 2.
Rate 2.
Al, PCM Bit Rate, Low.
Okay.
And Pro - We done that.
Verb 82 doesn't need any, think so.
You know when you're ullaging, I can see a reflection on the bouncing clock here. It goes red.
Yes.
Hello, Houston.
Go ahead, 12.
Roger. Single bank nominal SPS chamber pressure was 90. Dual bank was 95. Over.
Roger. 90 and 95.
That's affirmative on my gauge.
Okay. We going to have to go back to PTC.
Oh, Houston...
Go ahead, 12.
Do we have a - Let's see - we have a Go to Verb 66, the state vector?
I think we're supposed to, anyway.
There now.
Okay. Well, that was nice to get a touch of g again. Nothing came off the ceiling so we must have gotten everything down where it belongs.
Yes, the LM's still out in front of us.
That thing makes a bang when it starts.
Noticed that.
It kind of kicks; the same way the S-IVB did. It's funny because it had a bang instead of a jerk, and then everything goes smooth after that, the same way as on the stages.
That ran pretty good together, didn't it?
It started oxidizer balance that way we can start where it was.
All right. Houston, do you want anything else on the burn status report?
They locked up yet?
12, Houston. Doesn't look like we need anything more. We'll poll the room here. Standby.
And how does that engine look, Jerry, to the gentlemen on the ground?
It looks very good, and we don't need any more information.
Roger. Thank you. Okay, Dick. Let's grab the checklist and go to PTC.
I'm slowly maneuvering back there. Minimum impulse to PTC attitude.
Okay. And I'll put the Flight Plan here. Al, while we are doing that, why don't you grab the camera and swish her around here?...
Okay.
so I can finish - finish up the, okay.
I'll be moving the camera.
Did they copy my residuals, Pete?
I think they probably did. Did you copy the Y residuals, Houston? What was it, minus 0.3?
Yes, yes.
Affirmative, 12. We copied them all.
Okay.
Let's put this on the hatch, and they can see all the globules, all the little parts we didn't dump, but there's a part.
Shine it on the window out there, anyhow. On the TV screen...
Well, what you're seeing is a reflection of the fluorescent lights in the window. They couldn't figure that for a minute.
We turned one of them down...
I thought we had a friend flying along with us. See all those particles go by, Houston?
Sure can. It looks like a snow storm.
I been wondering where all of them came from, but I was watching the LM last night as it was coasting along, and there's a lot of small pieces of white material that's all over the LM, and I assume it's all over the other parts of the spacecraft, and then when we make a burn or something like that, it must shake parts of it loose.
I think what that is, Al, is ice from these water and urine dumps and everything that has collected on it, and then we shake them loose again.
Could be. Let's take a look out here at - at the LM...
12, this is Houston. Al, your mouth - mike must be away from your face a little bit too far. You're kind of hard to read on Vox.
Okay
Say, Houston, do you have any words on this - on what may have happened to our helium - excuse me - our RCS - RCS gauge - propellant quantity gauge? You apparently have - Do you have TM on the ground or you just taking this from pressures and Temp - helium pressure Temp?
Negative, Pete. We don't have TM on that on the ground; we're using pressures and temperatures to figure it.
Okay. Do you want the PTC checklist?
12. Houston. Our TM is showing the same thing you're seeing - off-scale high.
I see. Understand.
Well, let's - let's turn A and B off again for 20 minutes to stabilize. Do you concur, Houston?
Stand by, 12.
Yes, he said he concurred.
Okay. Quads A and B are off. We'll sit here and stabilize.
Okay, 12.
Well, that's one done. We only have five more to go.
That's right.
You know what you got now? You're getting - you hear those thruster firing. We're getting a little propellant slosh, I'll bet you.
Could very well be.
It sure is taking a while to settle down.
Look at that GDC already.
Yes, we ought to run a drift check on that and find out if it's just - it seems to be not only yaw but pitch
Hey, Houston, if it's all right with you, we will go ahead and secure the TV.
Okay, 12. You guys are looking real fine. That was a nice burn.
Okay.
Our compliments to your cameraman.
Okay.
Yes. You have to help us on the focus. We can frame it and everything up here, but the focus is difficult to see up in this monitor.
Al, if that's you talking, you're still not too good. Yes, the focus was real fine the last half of the show there, and right there when we were fiddling with it, it went bad and then you went through a good focal point and off to a fairly reasonably one, and it seemed to improve later on then.
Okay, I think the problem is if I zoom in on something, it's difficult to focus. I went back and was not zoomed in, and then it's a fairly easy situation.
That's affirm. It seemed to be pretty nice.
Thanks, Houston for your help.
12, Houston. We're starting the data dump now.
Apollo 12, Houston.
We copied you, Jerry - you can see us dumping now.
Roger.
And, Houston, we're planning to make a dump now. Is that okay?
Say again, 12.
We're planning a urine dump now, if that's okay.
Yes. No problem, 12. Go ahead.
Okay.
Apollo 12, Houston. Did you do a fuel cell O2 purge before the burn?
Negative. We didn't.
Okay. We'd just as soon you'd delay it until your next opportunity at 40 hours.
40 hours. Thank you. Well, we're sorry we missed that.
No sweat, 12.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. It looks like your rates are low enough now to start PTC; we notice your CMC Mode switch is in Hold position and you should be in Auto.
Okay.
There she goes, Houston.
Roger, 12.
Houston, this is 12. Do you want us to save all jets or just work in this 30-degree deadband until our sleep period?
12, Houston. You can turn them off now if you want to.
Okay. I'm just saving a couple that may fire on us or something, huh.
Roger.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Go ahead, Jer.
Roger. Go S-band antenna to Omni and Omni Bravo.
Roger. Omni to Omni Bravo.
