Lift-off. The clock's running.
I got a yaw program. [Pause.]
Six seconds.
There's 10 seconds.
Clear the tower.
Roger. Clear the tower. I got a pitch and a roll program, and this baby's really going.
Man, is it ever.
Roger, Pete.
Twenty seconds.
It's a lovely lift-off. It's not bad at all. [Pause.]
Everything's looking great. Sky's getting lighter.
Okay.
Thirty seconds.
Looks good.
Roll's complete.
This thing moves, doesn't it?
Roger, Pete. [Pause.]
What the hell was that?
Huh?
I lost a whole bunch of stuff; I don't know...
Turn off the buses.
Mark.
One Bravo.
Roger. We had a whole bunch of buses drop out.
Roger. We [garble] on that. [Long pause.]
There's nothing - it's nothing...
A circuit...
Where are we going?
I can't see; there's something wrong.
AC Bus 1 light, all the fuel cells...
[Garble.]
I just lost the platform.
All we've got's the GDC.
Yes.
Okay, we just lost the platform, gang. I don't know what happened here; we had everything in the world drop out.
Roger.
I can't - There's nothing I can tell is wrong, Pete.
I got three fuel cell lights, an AC bus light, a fuel cell disconnect, AC bus overload 1 and 2, Main Bus A and B out. [Long pause.]
I got AC.
We got AC?
Yes.
Maybe it's just the indicator. What do you got on the main bus?
Main bus is - The volt indicated is 24 volts.
Huh?
Twenty-four volts, which is low.
We've got a short on it of some kind. But I can't believe the volt...
Apollo 12, Houston. Try SCE to Auxiliary. Over.
Try FCE to Auxiliary.
What the hell is that?
Fuel cell...
SCE, SCE to auxiliary. [Long pause.]
Try the buses. Get the buses back on the line.
It looks - Everything looks good.
SCE to Aux.
The GDC is good.
Stand by for the - I've lost the event timer; I've lost the...
Mark. One Charlie.
One...
One Charlie.
Two minutes. EDS, Auto, is Off.
Yes.
EDS, Auto...
Apollo 12, Houston. Go for staging.
Roger. Go for staging we had some really big glitch, gang?
What do the buses read, Al?
Stand by.
Inboard [center] engine.
Okay.
Apollo 12, Houston. Try to reset your fuel cells now. [Long pause.]
Reset the fuel cells.
Wait for staging.
Wait for staging, yes.
Hang on.
Hang on.
25 - 27 - 32.
Got a clock running over here?
Yes. Hang on.
There's 41. Hang on, there it is.
That's it.
That's it. That's it.
Staging.
Hang on.
Okay, GDC is good.
Got a good S-II, gang.
Roger. We copy, Pete. You're looking good.
Cabin pressure's okay.
We're okay.
Okay. Now we'll straighten out our problems here. I don't know what happened; I'm not sure we didn't get hit by lightning.
GDC is good...
Your thrust is looking good, Pete.
Okay. I have a good GDC, and Al has got the fuel cells back on, and we'll be working on our AC buses.
Is that AC bus working?
Right, Pete. Your fuel cells look good down here.
Everything looks good.
Stand by.
[Garble.]
Think we need to do a little more all-weather testing.
Tower Jett.
Tower Jett.
Okay.
Amen.
There goes the tower, gang; that's away clean. It looked good.
There goes the tower, gang; that's away clean. It looked good.
Good show, Pete. You're in mode 2.
Roger. In mode 2. No sweat. [Long pause.]
PPO2 High.
I think that's probably the [garble].
I'll tell you what I think happened. We lost all the fuel cells.
They sure did; they dropped right off the...
We still got them back? We got them back now?
Yes.
Yes, they look okay.
Okay. We've got an ISS light on, and we've got a cycling CO2 partial pressure high, which I don't - bother me particularly, and we have reset all the fuel cells. We have all the buses back on the line, and we'll just square up the platform when we get into orbit.
Roger, Pete. That sounds good.
What's that PPO2 I want?
Hey, that's one of the better SIM's, believe me.
Phew! Man alive! I'll tell you what happened...
We've had a couple of cardiac arrests down here, too, Pete.
There wasn't any time for that up here. We've got a good clock running here, and correct me, I'm going to give you a mark at 4 plus 30. I've lost my event timer. And...
Mark.
4 plus 30.
Looks good, Pete.
Okay. We're all organized again, gang.
The only thing we've lost now is the ISS. That number 1 ball is just drifting all over the place, and we'll have to catch it later.
Roger, Dick.
We'd like to have the G&C guys think about how we're going to get that thing, because it's just drifting, just floating.
Okay. We're thinking. [Long pause.]
Stand by 5 minutes.
Can't say that I've ever seen that before. Man alive...
How about - Let me give it a Verb 40, Noun 20?
Let's not - let's not do anything until we get into orbit...
Yes.
Let's just lock it up.
Huh?
Let's lock it up.
No, let's let the ground worry about...
12, Houston. We won't be sending you an S-IVB to COI call.
Okay, understand. And can you give us the good words like let's get that DSKY - I mean the IMU calmed down. It's rolling all over the place.
Pete. And if you do a Mode IV, it'll be on the backup.
Yes, no sweat. I got a good SCS.
Okay. Good show.
I got a little vibration of some kind - She's chugging along here, minding her own business, though.
How's the pressures?
Okay, Pete.
How are the pressures?
What pressures? Oh, those...
Tank pressures.
Fine. Well...
Cabin pressure's good.
...I got to get - I got to get organized. What time is it?
Call it 04:59.
05:50.
05:50.
Stand by for the gimbal motors, Houston at 06:00.
05:50.
Okay.
Stand by, Al, for gim...
Roger, 12. [Pause.]
God darn Almighty! Wasn't that something, babe?
[Laughter.]
You know what it did? I know what it is; it knocked - it just took all the fuel cells off the line...
Yes, it did.
Yes, but what the hell did it?
Apollo 12, Houston. Level sense arm, 8 plus 37; cut-off, 9 plus 11.
Okay. Here comes the gimbal motors. [Long pause.]
Ready, Al? Pitch 1.
Go, babe.
06:16.
You got it.
Okay. Yaw 1.
You got it.
Okay. Here comes 2.
Yes.
And here comes 2. Okay. I think the thing that probably got the ISS was the low voltage. I don't know.
Yes. Yes, it just fell open.
Mark.
S-IVB to orbit.
S-IVB to orbit. [Long pause.]
Man, oh man...
Isn't that a...
Wasn't that a SIM they ever gave us?
Jesus!
[Laughter.]
That was something else. I never saw so many...
[Laughter.]
...There were so many lights up there, I couldn't even read them all.
[Laughter.]
There was no sense reading them because there was - I was - I was looking at this; Al was looking over there...
Everything looked great [laughter] except we had all the lights on...
Apollo 12, Houston. You're right smack dab on the trajectory; your IU is doing a beautiful job.
Okay. We're all chuckling up here over the lights. We all said there were so many on we couldn't read them. [Long pause.]
How about a Verb 40 Noun 20 or something to - to lock up that...
12, Houston. Give us Omni Delta.
Okay.
Roger. Going to Omni Delta. [Pause.]
How about your...
Hey, how about that? Get that on. Yes.
Got them. I got them on a while ago.
Okay. Good show.
Son of a gun.
What are we up to, 2g's?
[Laughter.]
Oops! Oops, center engine.
Center engine. [Long pause.]
Wake up!
[Laughter.]
[Garble] is something! [Laughter.]
That's known as the LMP's nightmare [laughter].
[Laughter.]
Sure it is.
Well, I'm - I'm starting to worry about this platform now, gang.
Yes.
Apollo 12, Houston. We can start getting that platform squared away. Go IMU power, Standby, and then back to on, and we'll get her caged up. [Pause.]
IMU, Power.
Power. Okay.
Standby, Proceed.
Okay.
We'll wait until we get through staging here, I think, Houston.
Okay. Soon as you can reach it; that's the way to go.
Where the hell is it?
IMU Power's over on [garble]...
Oh, [garble] side.
Apollo 12, Houston. Go for staging.
Roger. We're Go for staging.
[Garble] - G&N Power [garble]?
Yes.
Okay. You want the LMP to turn off the G&N power and then bring it back on, and you want me to use IMU cage switch, is that right?
Stand by on that, Pete. [Long pause.]
Don't hit that Cage switch.
08:48.
Okay. Stand by.
08:50.
09:11 is shutdown? Huh?
Yes, 09:11.
I think we got hit by lightning.
I do, too.
Something took care of those panels, I'll say that for it.
[Garble.]
09:10.
09:11, Dick.
Two [garble].
[Garble.]
Okay. Looks good.
You staging?
Yes. See the throttle?
Okay. There you go.
Got a good S-IVB; nice, smooth staging.
Look at that stuff go by.
Roger, Pete. Your thrust looks good.
Okay. Give us some more words on the IMU now. [Long pause.]
I got ice all over the windows out here, y'all. I got the horiz - don't have the horizon, but I got the sky.
Pointed down pretty good.
Hope those thrusters don't have the ice...
Stand by a minute, Pete. We're still talking.
Okay. [Long pause.]
No, we're - we're in good shape. Where's your card here, Dick? We're at the 9...
Okay. Hold still.
...[garble] low.
Yes. Okay. In 10 minutes, we should be at 246.
That was right on the profile. Good [garble].
Ten minutes.
All right. Get your - get your shutoff checklist out.
I got it. Now, listen, Dick, all this - best thing I can...
You haven't pushed this G&N Power, by the way.
Yes, yes...
Mark.
Mode IV.
Roger. Mode IV.
I got a restart - I got a Restart Program alarm, and all [garble] - there's the Gimbal Lock. Get it out of gimbal lock. [Garble] my timer, I [garble].
Well, this one's running.
[Garble.]
[Garble] 36.
Shutdown. We've got less than a minute to shutdown.
Now get the gimbal motors off...
Got about a half a g.
Yes, sir. We're getting [garble]...
Well, I'll tell you one thing. This is a first-class ride, Houston.
[Garble] just do it right.
Kind of a rough start.
Yes. I always like to start out behind the eight-ball and get ahead.
Cabin pressure looks good.
Yes, we ought to get shutdown here in about...
12, Houston. Cut-off, 11 plus 35.
35.
11 plus 35. Roger. Roger. [Long pause.]
I hope we can iron out...
I hope.
Yes, I do too. [Garble].
I don't either. I think it was the low voltage; it just fell off. Maybe it got hit.
Okay. Stand by for shutdown.
Stand by. 31, 32 [garble].
There it is...
Shutdown.
Shutdown. 11 plus 33, Houston.
Roger, Pete. [Long pause.]
Apollo 12, Houston. Before you get down there to work on that switch, try pulling on panel 5, your IMU main A and main B breakers.
Okay. That did it. They're both out. Now what do you want us to do?
Your S-IVB safe now. Stand by.
Okay.
You've got a go orbit. You're looking good. [Long pause.]
12, Houston. Your S-IVB is looking good. You are configured for orbit.
Roger, Houston.
Roger, 12. Your orbit is 102.5 by 100 [nautical miles, 189.8 by 185.2 km].
At least that didn't lose it. [Pause.]
