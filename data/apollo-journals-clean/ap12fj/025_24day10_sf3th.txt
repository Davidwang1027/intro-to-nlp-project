Hello, Houston; Apollo 12.
Good morning, Apollo 12.
Good morning, good morning. We are just getting cleaned up and eating breakfast.
Very good. Are you ready for the big day?
I don't know. What's happening?
Oh, we've got a nice little section in the South Pacific reserved for you. And we have most of the Navy standing by to pick you up.
Good. We've cleared certain area of all altitudes, huh?.
That's affirmative.
Houston, Apollo 12.
Go, 12.
Yesterday, I gave them a tentative storage arrangement and I'd like to modify that just one little bit, and I'll appreciate it if you'd let RETRO know.
Roger.
Instead of storing Dick's suit under the left-hand couch, we have some garbage in the TSB and we'd like put that in the hatch bag. And it's all soft and then we'd like to take Dick's suit and stow it under the right seat and that's the only change.
Roger; copy.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 12.
Go ahead, 12.
Morning, Don. Say, this is Al, and I put on that new EKG harness. How about asking the doctors to look at it and see if it's okay?
Roger...
I moved the lower - I moved the lower sternal up about 1 inch to keep it off the old spot. But I don't know if that makes any difference or not.
Roger. We'll have him check it for you.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Go ahead.
The surgeon reports that he is getting a good signal from both of you, and you're both definitely still alive.
Good show.
Houston, we stopped PTC for a moment to do some photography and we'll get back in it again in about 10 minutes.
Very good. When do you plan to do a P23? Will you do that before you...
Say again.
Do you plan...
Say again, Houston.
Do you plan to do the P23 while you're out of PTC before you re-enter?
We might as well. Let's see, we might be doing it just a few minutes early. We'll hold to 236. You want to do that?
Stand by. Okay. We're okay for early, and we have some attitudes for you when you're ready to copy.
Okay. I'll be back with you in a minute for the attitudes.
Houston, 12. You got a consumables update for me?
Roger. We'll get it for you momentarily; and in return, can you give us a sleep and PDR - PRD readout?
Roger. Across the board 8, 8½, 8½; 11032, 11032, 04034.
Thank you. Okay. The RCS total at 233 hours is 25.5; Alpha is 26.3; Bravo is 26.6; Charlie is 23.0; Delta is 26.2; H2 total is 21.9 percent; O2 total is 27.7 percent.
Copied all that. Thank you.
Houston, 12. Ready to copy those angles.
Roger. The P23 optics calibration attitude: roll, 89; pitch, 334; yaw, 0; the optics calibration star is star 24; P23 sighting attitude: roll, 87; pitch, 329; yaw, 316; for the fourth star, substitute star 24, for horizon. Note, if unable to use the star, go to the next star in sequence. No alternate stars will be updated, and please report the type of difficulty with any stars omitted.
Okay. P23 boresight optics calibration: 089, 334, 0; star 24: and P23 attitude 087, 329, 316; and, for star 4, substitute star number 24; no alternate stars. Please report difficulty with any stars omitted.
That's affirmative; and, with star 24, it's the far horizon.
Yes. I got that. far horizon.
Apollo 12, Houston. One flight plan change for you when you want to copy.
Okay. Go ahead.
At 238 hours and 30 minutes, the report of the Command Module RCS injector valve temperatures, I delay that report to 240 hours and that will improve our chances of not having to do any heating.
Okay. I just looked at them right now, and over the night during the PTC, they're all above 4, some just barely, and so we will have gone back into PTC for a while alter the and I think doing that, we'll probably be in pretty good shape.
Roger. Thank you, Pete.
Don't we have it - We have it until just before you do it.
Apollo 12, Houston. We would like to - you to give us the High Gain antenna if you would. We would like you to turn the power on. Give us wide beam width, Reacq mode. The pitch angle is minus 79, and yaw is 156.
Coming at you.
There you go; it's all locked up.
Thank you.
You want to leave it in Wide?
That's affirmative...
you want to leave it in Wide? Okay.
Houston, Apollo 12.
Go ahead, 12.
Hey, would you check with the boys in the back room? Should I have - be having any trouble with Jupiter, as far as seeing it or not? I can't see it. Do I have a right vector in?
Roger. We're checking.
This is a surprise to me. I - you wouldn't think I'd have trouble seeing Jupiter.
Hello, Houston; 12. It's all right. I got it now.
Very good. That gives us a lot of comfort to realize they're all still up there.
Why should that be comforting to you? What if we missed one? What would you care?
Oh, we don't mind if we miss a star, but if all the planets aren't there, you know, the astrologers are really bent out of shape.
Well, being there and seeing is one - two different things.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 12.
Go, 12.
Don, star 75 is not visible.
Roger. No 75.
And I'm going to press on to star 24.
Roger.
Don, one of the problems I'm having with this one is, that star is so dim that when I get it down to the airglow, it almost washes out to nothing, and I can't quite tell where it is. But I'll go ahead and mark on him anyway.
Roger.
Half the time I can't find him; I lose him.
That's about the toughest star I've had to do so far.
Say again, Dick.
I said that one is about the toughest one I've had.
We're giving you your Max test since this is your last chance.
Well, if they get any dimmer than that, I'm not going to be able to see them.
Roger.
Houston, on this particular star here, there's a big round, very dim - very dim orange ball that covers about three-quarters of the sextant, but I can see the star through it even though it doesn't appear orange itself.
Is that a Sun reflection, or what's causing the orange ball? Do you know?
I don't know. I would suspect it might be the proximity to the Sun, but I'm really not sure of that.
Roger.
I don't have the complete orange - I don't have the complete orange ball in the sextant, but I've got the better half of it.
Roger. Copy.
Look at that - Look at that - Look at that patch and you can see how much of the Moon is in that patch, and that's a little bit more than that in here on the Sun.
Roger, Dick.
We suspect that's scattered light, Dick.
I'm sure it is.
Houston, 12,
Go ahead.
Don, I can't use this star either. Once I start moving it, there's so much scattered light that I lose the star completely, and I can't keep track of it.
Roger. That's what the test is to show. Thanks.
Okay. I'll press on to the next one.
Roger.
As the famous astronaut once said, press.
Well, I think that's a good one to end on.
Very good.
I'll give you an optics Cal again.
Okay.
Dick, Houston. Can you tell us how the horizon compares now with the second batch of trans-lunar that you did when you had a good clear horizon?
The second batch - Which second batch are you referring to, Don? On the way out or on the way back in?
Trans-lunar, on the way out.
Well, I think there's probably a little learning process as to what is the horizon you ought to be using. I think far too much is made of that airglow layer, and you can almost use what you think is the horizon, which also includes the airglow layer. And it's really not that undefined. It's fairly definite; it's very easy to use. And I think the second set that I did going out was by far the better one, and I've been using that particular horizon for all of these all the - on the way back in.
Roger. We copy. Thank you very much.
Apollo 12, Houston. If you're interested, we've got football scores, the morning headlines, and the local weather for you, if you want to work that in among your busy activities.
Don, go ahead. We'll listen right now.
Roger. The scores from yesterday in the NFL: Cleveland 28, New York 17; Detroit 16, Green Bay 10; Philadelphia 34, St. Louis 30; Washington, 27, over Atlanta, 20; Los Angeles, 24, to Dallas, 23; Baltimore over Chicago, 24 to 21; Minnesota, 52, over Pittsburgh, l4; New Orleans, 43, to San Francisco, 38. In the AFL: Oakland took Kansas City, 27 to 24; Houston 32, Miami 7; New York 40, Cincinnati 7; Boston 35, Buffalo 21; and San Diego 45, Denver 24. In the news: Splashdown stories and yesterday's news conference are getting good coverage. Pete's boys, Andy and Chris, did a little soaring of their own yesterday. Scott Royce took the boys and Jane up for a ride yesterday. Andy said he'd rather be a soaring pilot than an astronaut. You can work that out with him later, Pete. And Chris's reaction was, "It feels good, but I still like to water ski the best." There's a provocative headline, "Boston Hospital Maternity Wards Are Feeling The Impact Of Two Severe February Snow-storms, "and I'll let you imagine how the story runs. The Houston weather is pretty bad. It's overcast and drizzling, not really a day the Chamber of Commerce would be proud of; however, in the landing area, we're reporting 1800 scattered and a high scattered, winds out of the east at 15 knots with 10-mile visibility. The waves are 3 feet; you've got 5-foot swells, and if you've remembered to pack your lava-lavas it should be a lovely day in the South Pacific.
Thank you, Don. It sounds real good, and we'll be happy to see the land of lava-lavas.
Very good.
Houston, 12.
Go ahead.
What do you want us to disable for PTC, C and - C and D?
That's good. Yes.
Okay, fine. C and D are going off and we'll stabilize.
Apollo 12, if you will set in on the High Gain pitch, 40; yaw, 270, we'll take over on the ground and switch your antennas for you.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 12.
Go ahead.
Don, I guess we ought to start thinking about getting these state vectors up to speed. I have the onboard ones for the CSM and the ground CSM state vectors in the LM slots. Do you want us to put the ground vector in both slots now?
Just a second, Dick; we're talking.
Okay.
Dick, Houston. The vectors that you've got in there now are quite satisfactory for the present, but we're going to send you some much better ones in the Flight Plan, so we'll - We don't think there's any need to play with them now, and we'll send you up some better ones later.
Okay. I've got a 239:30 as the time we were talking about. Okay. Very good.
I didn't particularly appreciate your saying much better. You could have said a little better, couldn't you?
Sorry about that. It's early in the morning down here.
Houston, 12. We're ready to start PTC when you give us the word.
Roger.
12, give us a few more minutes to let the rates damp out, please.
Apollo 12, Houston. Let's go ahead and roll it on the PTC.
Roger. We're starting PTC.
Roger. And I'm about to turn you over to the tender care of Paul Weitz, so we'll see you when you get back to the LRL. And have fun in the South Pacific.
Okay, Don. Thank you much, and that you for all your help.
Very good. We'll see you later. Goodbye.
Houston, Apollo 12.
Go, 12.
Good morning, Paul. Is anybody down there thinking about getting this eclipse as far as we're concerned when the Sun goes behind the Earth? We've got - What we've got is some -We've got some 16-millimeter black and white and some 70-millimeter black and white.
Okay. We'll check on it. We're getting the times on that now. We'll pass those up to you and, when we do, we'll give you the dope on the - what they want it taken with.
12, Roger.
Hello, 12; Houston. On our last LOS during your roll, we did not acquire High Gain; we expected to. Would you verify if your High Gain angles are pitch, 40; yaw, 270?
Okay. We have minus 40 - plus 40 in pitch.
That's affirmative. It should be plus 40.
Hello, 12; Houston. I've got a couple of things for your Operations Checklist, page Foxtrot 5-8.
Stand by.
Okay. Say which page, Don?
That's Fox 5-8.
Oh, okay; 5-8.
Right.
Go ahead.
Okay. We pick up the checklist there with the EMS drift check, and we would like to know the results of that on the ground when it's complete. And now, about the ninth line down, where it calls out the set Delta-Vc, we'd like you to set the Delta-Vc plus 100 feet a second if you would, please.
Okay.
And that's it. Thank you.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 12.
12, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. Roger, Paul. This little EMS test that's in the checklist for the P41; I just ran it for 100 seconds. I set it at 100 feet per second. It ran for 100 seconds, and now the EMS reads 102.2. Over.
All right. We'll massage that and see what it means down here, Dick. Thank you.
Okay.
Hello, 12; Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, Dick. We're looking right now at a midcourse 7 of about 2-1/2 feet a second. They want to get another - about another half hour of tracking, after which they will work up your maneuver PAD for you then.
Okay. We're not in any big rush except to get home, and we'll wait any length time you need for that midcourse.
Okey-doke.
Hello, Apollo 12; Houston. I have some information for you on the solar corona photos.
Stand by a second.
Go ahead, Paul.
Okay. They just want you to take photos coming out of the shadow, and they're requesting that you use the Hasselblad, because you indicated the black-and-white film. Use the 80-millimeter lens, an f-stop of 2.8 focused at infinity. They want you to take as many photos as you can, starting at a GET of 241:55:20. Now this is approximately 2 minutes before your sunrise. To start off with, use a shutter speed of 1 second. As you come out of the shadow, as soon as you can see a hairline Sun, change your shutter speed to 1/125th, and - Stand by 1. I'll have your final setting in just a minute.
Okay, 12. And, as I said, as soon as you can see any sign of the sun at all, switch your - change your shutter speed to 1/125th. Take photos at that setting for 5 to 10 seconds, after which as the Sun comes up, then change to f:16 at 1/500th of a second. And you can just take a bunch of photos at that; and, for information, the sunrise time is 241:57:18. Over.
Roger. Understand. We'll start about GET 241:55:20; we'll use black and white, 80-millimeter lens, and we'll have it set at 2.8, infinity, 1 second. And the first time we see a sliver of Sun, we'll switch it to 1/125th and work on that for about 15 seconds; then we'll shift over to f:11, 1/500th, and take some more.
Okay, Al. Change over after the Sun - After you see the first sign of the Sun, go about 10 seconds instead of 15; and after the Sun starts coming up, your final f-stop is 16. That's f:16 at a 500th.
Understand; f:16 and 10 seconds at the earlier setting of f:2.8 at 1/125th.
That's affirmative, Al. Also, in your Flight Plan, we call for a Comm check at 239 hours. We're not going to run that Comm check. We would, however, like you to go ahead and fire up your VHF and we'll hold off until we get indications of a good signal strength on the ground, at which time we'll then run a VHF Comm check.
Sounds good. I just turned it on right now.
Okay. Thank you.
Also, Houston, when you give us an attitude for this solar picture, how about giving it to us so it's good out window 5? That's our best window.
Roger, 12.
12, Houston with your photography attitude.
Go.
Go ahead.
Okay. That's roll, 300; pitch, 310; yaw, 0, and that should give it to you out window 5.
Roger. Roll, 300; pitch, 310; yaw, 0; window 5.
Roger.
Houston, 12.
Go ahead, 12.
Let me give you our final stowage configuration; we swapped back again. We've got everything the way we told you - Dick's - We've got one suit under the left-hand couch, and it has a helmet on, and the other two helmets are on top of the Surveyor bag, tied down right in front of A-4 and A-5. Everything else is the way we gave it to you.
Okay. Thank you, Pete.
Houston, 12.
Go ahead, 12.
Do you really want us to run this CMC self-check?
Stand by.
Hello, 12; Houston. We see no requirement for that self-check.
Okay.
Apollo 12, Houston. We have some words on your P52.
Okay.
Okay. The attitude based on the PTC REFSMMAT is roll, 091.2; pitch, 161.7; yaw, 021.6. Stars - the stars are 35, Rasalhague, and Pete's old favorite, 37, Nunki. We haven't passed up a burn attitude yet, but you - This will put you at the burn attitude, except you'll be 180 degrees out in roll.
Okay.
And your High Gain angles are pitch, minus 85; yaw, 255.
Okay.
Apollo 12, Houston. I have a midcourse 7 PAD for you when you're ready to copy.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. It's midcourse 7 RCS/G&N: 24985, NA, NA, 241:21:57.38, minus 0002.4, plus all zeros, plus 0000.1, 000, 310, 000, NA, NA, 0002.4; 0:05; 0002.4. Your sextant star is 10, 241.7: 39.5. There's no Apollo star available for a boresight check. Your GDC stars are Sirius, 15; Rigel, 12. The angles, 336, 262, 357; four-jet ullage; that's a four quad burn. And just some comments to pass up to you; they're not related to the burn. Since the burn is so short, we'll make no correction for your EMS drift. It looks right now like you have 64 hours of battery time on the water, and we're going around the room now to see whether or not to give you a Go for entry. Over.
Hey, you guys are all right. Stop the world; I want to get off.
Houston, Apollo 12. Let us know when you're ready for the readback on that PAD.
Okay. We're ready and waiting.
Okay. We thought you were going to do something about that Go.
No, we're still massaging it. Go ahead and read it back.
Okay. 24985, NA, NA, 241:21:57.38, minus 0002.4, plus all zips, plus 0000.1, 000, 310, 000, NA, NA, 0002.4, 0:05, 0002.4, 10, 241.7, 39.5, Sirius 15, Rigel 12, 336, 262, 357, it's four-jet burn.
That's affirmative, Al.
Hello, 12; Houston. We're going to let you come back, so I have an entry PAD for you.
Okay. Gosh, you guys are okay today. We'll be ready to copy in just a second.
Go ahead.
Okay. Entry to the MPL: 000, 151, 000, 244:05:18, 267, minus 158.1, minus 165.17, 06.1, 36116, 6.49, 1167.3, 36198, 244:22:18, 00:29. The next four blocks are all NA down to D0, 400, 02.11, 00:19, 03:27, 08:04, the sextant star is 23, 294.7, 29.0, the boresight star is Procyon, 016, up 14.6; left 1.0; lift vector, up. Use the EMS non-exit pattern. And some times for you here: GET of sunset, 240:32:07; sunrise, 241:57:23. You'll cross the terminator at 244:14:04; and, if you're interested, moonset is at 244:20:05. Over.
Okay. 000, 151, 000, 244:05:18, 267, minus 158.1, minus 165.17, 06.1, 36116, 6.49, 1167.3, 36198, 244:22:18, 00:29, 400, 02.11, 00:19, 03:27, 08:04, 23, 294.7, 29.0, Procyon, 016; up 14.6; left 1.0; up. Use EMS non-exit pattern, sunset 240:32:07; sunrise 241:57:23. We'll cross the terminator at 244:14:04; moonset, 244:20;05.
That's all Charlie, Al.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 12; Houston. When you take those corona photos, it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to turn the lights down in the cabin to try to minimize reflections off the window, Pete. Over.
Okay. We'll do that.
And the computer's yours anytime you want it, Houston.
Okay. Thank you.
Computer's yours, Dick.
Roger. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 12.
Go ahead, 12.
The CM RCS injector temp's, are as follows: 5 Charlie, 4.3; 5 Delta, 4.4; 6 Alpha, 4.0; 6 Bravo, 4.5; 6 Charlie, 4.3; 6 Delta, 4.8.
Roger, copy, 12. Thank you.
Okay, 12. No preheat on the injector.
Okay.
Houston, 12. Are you copying the DSKY?
Roger. We got them, 12.
Okay. We are going to torque it at this time.
Roger.
Houston, 12.
Go ahead, 12.
We're rolling left to the burn attitude; we going to lose the High Gain?
Stand by.
Affirmative, 12. Give us Omni Delta, please.
Okay.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 12.
Go ahead, 12.
We're getting a spectacular view at eclipse. We're using the Sun filter for the G&N optics, looking through, and it's unbelievable.
Roger. Understand, Dick.
The reason it looks so much different is the limb of the Earth is eclipsing it. It's not quite a straight line, but it's certainly a large, large disk right now. Looks quite a bit different than when you see the Moon eclipse the Sun.
Roger.
Anybody down there know how I - what we can set the camera at to use the Sun filter on it? To - to - take a couple of shots of this eclipse right through it?
Stand by and we'll check.
They'd better hustle.
Okay.
Funny thing is, you cannot see the Earth at all when you just shield your hand from the Sun and look out right next to it where the Earth should be. It's not there at all. When you stick your smoked glass up, you can see where it's cutting the - the Sun. Otherwise, it's completely invisible.
Roger, Al.
Fantastic sight. What we see now is - The Sun is almost completely eclipsed now, and what it's done is illuminated the entire atmosphere all the way around the Earth, even though the Sun is still on what looks like the western limb of the Moon - the Earth to us.
Roger. Understand, Al. And we're still working on getting a procedure for taking some photographs of it.
Man, it's too light. We're using those for sunrise. I think they'll be exactly the same.
Okay.
But the diameter of the Earth now looks compared - to the Moon - I'd say about 15 times the diameter of the Sun; but it's illuminating the whole atmosphere all the way around. It really looks pretty. You can't see the Earth. It's black just like the - space.
Roger. Understand you cannot make out the Earth at all.
No. You can't see any features on it. All you can see is this sort of purple-blue, orange, some shades of violet, completely around the Earth. It's illuminated.
Roger.
It's very interesting looking at the atmosphere. It has blues and pinks in it, but instead of being banded, it's segmented, which is very peculiar; I don't understand why. It may be the difference between over the landmasses and water or something.
Roger, Pete. Understand. Is it kind of like you would see in the desert in the evening sometimes when you get that blue and pink streaking in the sky?
Yes. Except, like I say, it's segmented for about - Right from the Sun, around about a quarter of the Earth is pure blue, and then it becomes pink to about 20 degrees of arc; and then it turns back to blue again. And it's blue all the way around the bottom - to where it turns pink again, and then it turns blue again.
Roger, 12.
It's a heck of a time to be without any 70-millimeter color film, I'll tell you.
But I know how to get it on a 16-millimeter camera.
Okay, Al. Good show. We were just thinking the same thing.
Have you got a suggestion on the f-stop for the 16 millimeter?
We're working on it.
It looks - It looks like this is going to have a luminated atmosphere, probably the whole time it's eclipsed. What it looks like now through the smoked glass is that the Sun is completely set behind the Earth, and you probably know better than I do from some...
Roger. We're using it at 1/60th at 1 frame a second and I - using 1.4 f-stop and also at 2 - and what - and a 1. What it looks like is the Sun is set, but it's so close to the limb of the Moon on the backside there, that that bright light is being channeled through the atmosphere, and so if you look at it with a naked lie - eye you can't tell the Sun is set yet. Through the smoked glass, you can see that it's no longer a disk there, but you just see a bright white line the diameter of the Sun.
Roger, Pete. Understand. Al.
Houston, 12.
Go ahead, 12.
We're shooting these at 1/60th at 1.4, and that's where we're going to stay unless you come up with a better suggestion.
Roger. We got that, Dick; 1/60th, 1.4 at 1 frame a second. They're working on it in the back room and, actually according to our figures here, you should still be seeing a little piece of the Sun. You don't enter the full umbra until a little after 241 GET.
You're absolutely correct. We still have a little bit of Sun through the horizon on the western limb.
Roger.
But right now, the Earth is completely - the atmosphere of the Earth is completely illuminated all the way around, 360, and right in the center it's as black - it's as dark at the - as space behind it itself. This is really spectacular.
Roger.
Have you got any more adjectives for spectacular? I'd like to use some if you have.
No. We'll put somebody to work on that, too.
Hello, 12; Houston. You're taking these pictures through the optics, right?
Negative, Houston. Through the hatch window.
Okay.
12, Houston. Which lens do you have on the DAC?
I have 18 millimeter.
Okay.
Okay, 12; Houston. We've got some words for you. Set aligns to f:2, go to Time on your mode select and give us a 1-second exposure, if you would. Hit the button that opens the shutter; hit the button again that closes it.
Understand. We'll work on it.
Houston, Apollo 12. One thing that puzzles us a little bit, perhaps FIDO can answer it. It looks to us like the Sun is being eclipsed by the Earth - Earth's North pole or South pole. It's kind of hard to tell what - whether it is its East or West limb. Have you got any additional dope there on that?
Okay. We'll find out and see which direction it's moving.
Hello, 12; Houston. For the mode select in Time to function properly on the camera, the shutter speed has to be set to 1/60th even though that's not our actual shutter speed.
I'd say we've got it. Thank you, though, Houston.
Roger.
This has got to be the most spectacular sight of the whole flight. We can see now that the Sun's behind the Earth. We can see clouds sort of on the dark part of the Earth; and, of course, the Earth's still defined by this thin narrow - or thin blue-and-red segmented band. It's a little bit thicker over at the - down where the Sun just set than it is at the other one, but it is really a fantastic sight. The clouds appear sort of pinkish gray, and they're sort of scattered all the way around the Earth. It would be interesting to know exactly what part of the Earth we're looking at or what our nadir is now, because that part doesn't appear to have any clouds, and these others appear to be sort of revolving around it.
Roger, Al. Understand that you can see clouds all the way around the Earth including the dark portion of it, and your nadir right now is just about the Indian Ocean.
Well, the whole - the whole Earth is dark to us. We looking at the night side, but we can see all the clouds. We haven't been able to distinguish landmasses yet, but we might be able to in a minute when we get a little bit better adapted, and I think the airglow is illuminating the clouds down there.
Roger, Pete.
12, Houston. I'll give you a time hack to ignition so you can check your DET. It'll be at 8 minutes which is about 40 seconds away.
What happened to your time hack?
Well, we're going to come up on 8 minutes - Yes, I blew it. I'll give you one at 7:30.
Okay. I - you had me worried for a minute.
Okay. We're discussing the important parts, such as which side of the world the Sun's set on. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
Mark.
7:30.
Okay. We're right with you.
Say, Houston. It's very interesting. We can see lightning and the thunderstorms down there on the Earth. I don't know how many miles out we are, but all the cloud cover that has thunderstorms in it, we can see lightning - you can see it quite clearly, flashing from wherever we are.
Yes. They look like - sort of just like fireflies down there blinking off and on.
Yes. Yes. You're about 25,750 out.
Yes. We're starting to look out for these synchronous satellites now. We've been looking up ahead.
Okay.
Sure hate to run into one up here.
Yes. It could ruin your day.
Apollo 12, Houston. If those lightning flashes are fairly frequent, we'd like to see if we can capture some of them on film, which would be the mode you are presently in with the speed set to 1/60th at f:2, remain in the Time on the mode select, and leave the shutter open for 1 to 2 minutes.
Oh, yes. They're - they're equally - they're - They're that frequent. There's two areas down there that are quite active right now.
Paul, have you got any idea of how to hold that camera still for 1 to 2 minutes?
No.
Okay.
We'll give it her go after we get this burn off.
Okay.
Hello, 12; Houston. On your question on where the Sun went behind the Earth, we've decided that it did go behind the western limb of the Earth in the Northern hemisphere and should reappear on the Eastern limb, still in the Northern hemisphere.
Roger.
Okay. Plus 0.1, plus 0.1, minus nothing.
Roger, 12.
12, Houston. What did your EMS read after that burn, please?
I even hate to tell you, it's - I'd say it's 102.4 to burn down to 100 - At the end of the burn, it was 101.4 and moving fast...
It was 102.7 at burn time after turning it on the normal switch at the proper 30 seconds before the burn.
Roger. Understand.
Houston, 12. We - we're better night-adapted now, and by golly, we can see India, and we can see the Red Sea, and we can see the Indian Ocean quite early. It's amazing how well we can see, for that matter. We can see Burma and the clouds going around the coastline of Burma, and we can see Africa and the Gulf of Aqaba; it looks like the same photograph Dick and I took on 11.
Roger, Pete.
We can also distinguish the lights of large towns with our naked eye, just barely, and by using the monocular, we can confirm that that's what we're seeing.
Roger, 12. That's very interesting. You may now hold the class record for seeing lights.
I can tell you, there's a couple of ripdoozer thunderstorms down there that are really - really letting go.
From what can you see of the geography there, can you tell where the thunderstorms are, Pete?
Okay. I'll give you a fix on this one that is really bright.
I'm going to give you a fix and say that it's about 2,300 miles to the southwest of the tip of India. There seems to be a weather system out there, and it's got thunderstorms all the way along it.
Roger, 12.
It's - Venus is just below the Earth, and we can see Venus quite clearly, well, you can see all kinds of stars, but Venus is just below the Earth. This is - This is really a sight to behold, to see it at night time like this.
Roger.
Hello, 12; Houston. For your information, weather does not have any surface reports from that region, but the satellite picture does show quite extensive cloud coverage of the area you're reporting the lightning.
Okay. I got a - Unfortunately, we've got our Earth map stashed away. I wish I had it out. I'm not sure that I'm giving you the absolute exact location. And the other thing is, it looks like, just north of India and I'd say all up through China and Russia, if that's what we're looking at, the whole area in there looks like it is completely covered with clouds.
Roger. Understand, Pete.
Also, also, right in the center of the Earth now, we have some real bright light shining, staying on - that - that Dick's looking at with the monocular. It's really bright.
Roger. Understand. Does it appear to be coming from your nadir point, which should be just off the Eastern coast of India now?
Yes. Looks like it's coming just about out of the center of what we're looking at. I would say south of Burma and east of India.
Roger. That's just about your nadir.
I can't imagine what that is.
We can't either. We're checking for possibilities.
It's a steady light, and it appears in size to be as big as any of the thunderstorms flashing.
Yes. It's as big as Venus at least.
Roger. I think we understand that.
And looking at the airglow with the monocular is - Boy, there is another sight now that is not like being in Earth orbit whatsoever. It's -it's a bright red next to the Earth, and then it's got a green band in it, and then it's got a blue band.
Would you say these color bands encircle the Earth now, Pete?
Yes. But it's not the same all the way around. What I'm seeing is - is sunrise, really. The Sun is - this is about 40 degrees from the Sun, and there's a red - bright red band - and then a sort of a light green band that's very thin, and then a blue one which must be all of the atmosphere.
Roger.
12, Houston. Can you still see that bright light about in the center?
We're - Al - Al - we rolled so Al could take the sunrise pictures, and the Sun has pretty well wiped out that view that we had. Now the Sun's started up, and the Earth has turned black again.
Roger. Understand.
Houston, 12.
Go ahead, 12.
Paul, does it look like we are going to have an update to our entry PAD - or not, after that burn?
Stand by. I'll check on it, Dick.
12, Houston. They want to get a little more tracking on you. It looks good. Some of the - some of the times may change a second or two, but as soon as they get a good track, we'll send it on up.
Okay. Not pushing, just curious.
Roger.
Hello, 12; Houston. If it's not already there, will you select the left VHF antenna, please?
Roger. Left VFH antenna.
Okay. And, also, the ground readout of suit pressure dropped to zero a few minutes ago. Will you give us your onboard readout?
Oh, it sure did. It reads zero also.
Okay, we just wanted to confirm it. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 12. I sort of think that time you gave me to start shooting, 241:55:20, is the time that the Sun will be completely over the limb of the Earth, and it would be too late then. I've been shooting per your instructions for the last 3 or 4 minutes. Can you confirm that?
I'll check on it, Al.
I understand, Al, that you can see the Sun, now. Is that right?
That's affirmative. I've been watching it for about the last 4 or 5 minutes. I didn't put a clock on it, but I started that sequence you gave me when the Sun started to peek around. I expect that the time I got that came out of the computer was the time when it's going to be fully out.
Okay, Al. Good show.
Apollo 12, Houston. I have your landing area information, if you're interested.
Go ahead.
Okay. The forecast hasn't changed since this morning, Pete. Still calling for good weather; 1,800 foot, scattered, variable, broken, 10 miles; the wind is out of the East at 15; we've got 3-foot waves on top of 5-foot swells, and they're running about 40 degrees apart. The altimeter is 2,988, which gives a Delta-H of plus 38 feet. Your landing time now looks like 2058 Zulu. Sunrise was at 1612 - Zulu that is, and sunset will be at 04:24. There are some widely scattered showers in the area, less than 10 percent. Okay, on the recovery forces, the Hornet's on station. They will have three helos there, four of them. Swim 1 and 2, with swimmers onboard; Recovery 1 for the swimmer and a medic, and Photo 1. We've also got two E-1's that'll be airborne - that's Airboss and Relay 1. We've got two C130s. It will be 40 minutes getting to on station and they've got a Para rescue on board. Their calls are Samoa Rescue 1 and 2. Over.
Houston, 12. We copied all that.
Roger.
Hello, 12; Houston. Give us 0mni Alpha, please.
12, Houston. Omni Alpha, please.
Hello, Apollo 12; Houston. Requesting 0mni Alpha.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 12.
Go ahead, 12.
Roger. We'd like to go through the logic sequence.
Stand by.
Okay, 12. We were waiting for High Bit Rate. We have it now, so go ahead.
Okay. We'll give you a holler as we get to them.
Roger.
Okay. We're down to ELS Auto, Houston, and we're ready for the sequence logic 2 on up.
61 logic, Mark; 62 logic, Mark.
12, Houston. You're Go for Pyro Arm.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 12; Houston. Over.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Apollo 12, Houston. Over.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Apollo 12, Houston. Over.
Hello, Apollo 12; Houston. Negative downlink; request you tune for Max. Over.
Hello, Apollo 12; Houston in the blind. Negative downlink. Try to raise us on any antenna you can, including VHF. Over.
Hello, Apollo 12; Houston. Over.
Hello, Apollo 12; Houston. Over.
This is 12. Go ahead.
Hello, 12; Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We haven't been able to get a hold of you guys for a little bit. Where have you been?
Right here.
Sitting on the checklist Omni Charlie like it said, which apparently wasn't the right one.
Yes. We tried to get an Omni Alpha call to you, but didn't get it in in time, I guess.
Okay. What do you need?
I'll find out if they want anything different.
Okay.
12, Houston. We lost everything, including down data, during that 10 or 15 minutes. Have you performed your sextant star check?
That's affirmative. We're just getting ready to align again, and we'll perform it right after we align.
Okay. Thank you.
And the boresight star even checks out.
How about that?
Houston, 12. You got the torquing angles?
Roger. We've got them.
Houston, we're activating the water boiler at this time.
Roger, 12.
Houston, 12. EMS check's okay.
Roger, Dick. Thank you.
And we're down in the checklist at final storage.
Roger and 12 Houston. A reminder is that the camera settings for your fireball and chutes photos are not in the checklist. They only appear in the Flight Plan there.
Roger. Thank you; we got it.
12, Houston. We're ready with your state vector if you'll give us Accept.
Okay. Just a second. You've got it.
Got it.
12, Houston. The computer's yours.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 12; Houston. The only change worth noting on your PAD is the EMS range to Go.
Okay. What's that?
That is now 1166.3.
Roger. Copy 1166.3.
That's right.
Hello, 12; Houston. Give us a right antenna on VHF, will you, please?
Roger. Right antenna, VHF.
Okay, Houston. Are we Go for Pyro Arm for Command Module RCS Prep?
Stand by.
12, Houston. You're Go for Logic Arm.
Logic 1, Mark; Logic 2, Mark.
12, Houston. You're Go for Pyro Arm.
Roger. Go for Pyro Arm.
Okay, Houston. We'll be coming up with the Command Module RCS check in just a minute.
Roger, 12. We're ready whenever you are.
0kay.
Hello, 12; Houston. The check looked good here.
Looked good up here, too.
Roger. It looked good here.
Uh-oh, 12; Houston. Give us Omni Charlie, please.
Going Omni Charlie.
Hello, 12; Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Just a reminder, Pete. Since the - Your steam pressure readout on the secondary system has been erratic in the re-entry phase; Just double check that you're on Primary.
Roger. We're on Primary.
Roger.
Hello, 12; Houston. Give us VHF left, please.
Roger. VHF left.
Okay, Houston. Bus ties.
Roger, 12.
Apollo 12, Houston. I'll give you a time hack at 25 minutes, which is about 50 seconds away, and if one of you wants to turn down your S-hand volume, we'll get a VHF voice check.
0kay.
Hello, Apollo 12; Houston. S-band/VHF Simul. How do you read?
Stand by for a mark at 25 minutes: 3, 2, 1...
Mark
Hello, 12; Houston. Were you reading our VHF?
That's affirmative.
Affirmative.
Roger.
12, Houston. If you're talking VHF now, you're very broken and garbled, and we're not reading you, yet.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 12. How do you hear?
Loud and clear, Dick.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. We're going to arm the pyros for SEP.
Roger, 12.
12; Houston. We confirm separation.
Roger.
12, Houston. I'll give you another back on your DET at 10 minutes, which is about 1 minute from now.
Okay.
Stand by for your mark. 3, 2, 1...
Mark.
Ten minutes.
Roger. We're right with you.
Hello, Apollo 12; Houston through ARIA.
Loud and clear, Houston.
Roger, 12.
On my mark, you'll have moonset, Houston. You can check your time. 3, 2, 1...
Mark.
Moonset.
12, Houston. Coming up on blackout. We'll see you at 3:28.
Hello, Apollo 12; Houston. Over.
Hello, Apollo 12; Houston. Over.
Hello, Houston. You read Apollo 12 out of blackout?
Roger, 12. Reading you loud and clear now.
Okay. It's right on the money.
Roger. We concur, Pete.
We're taking our second dive in.
Roger.
Pulling 3g's, and it starts the Earth mode.
That first time I get a shower at 6g thought I'd wiped all the water out of the tunnel. We're doing great.
Roger. 12.
Okay, Houston. We've got 50 miles to go on my mark.
Mark.
Hello, 12; Houston. We have radar and S-band contacts on you.
Roger.
Got drogues, Houston.
10,000. Standing by for mains.
There go the mains. Three, but they're not reefed. There they go. They dereefed. Hello, Houston; Apollo 12. Three gorgeous beautiful chutes. And we're at 8,000 feet, on our way down in great shape.
12, Houston. Give us your Lat-Long, please.
Air Boss, we read you loud and clear, and we're okay.
Roger, Apollo 12. Set your contact report, please.
Say again. Over.
This is Recovery. Tally ho; I have a visual.
This is Recovery. I am 3 miles north of the 300 radial. Three miles - I have a visual. He is bearing 135 from me, 6000. I am - pretty good. Looks good.
Roger 2 had zero bearing...
The Command Module is just above the cover of the clouds at 5,500 feet.
Photo 1 has zero, zero.
200.
This is Recovery. I still have a visual. He's just beginning to sink into the clouds.
Apollo 12, Apollo 12, this is Air Boss transmitting in the blind. Your primary transmitter is inoperative, inoperative. Switch to Secondary 259.7 and. Over. We have a visual on you; we have a visual on you.
This is Recovery. I've lost visual contact. He hit the clouds. I'm down. Tally ho, another visual: 4 miles, getting N 130, passing through 4,000 feet.
This is Recovery. Passing through 3,500. Range 4 miles on the Command Module; three chutes; looks good. Going into another cloud.
12, how do you read Air Boss?
Roger. Read you same. We're all okay.
Roger. Understand. You look great.
Recovery 1 has visual 100. This is Recovery. Seems to be about 1,500 feet above the water, three good chutes.
Roger, Recovery. Roger.
This is Recovery. Still in contact.
Splashdown.
