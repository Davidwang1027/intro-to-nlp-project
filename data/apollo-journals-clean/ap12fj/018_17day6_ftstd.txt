Houston. Intrepid, picking up the launch Prep Verb 98 at LO minus 02:50.
Roger, Intrepid.
Okay, Houston. You see that 2127. That's the same thing we had before, also.
Roger, Intrepid. Me copy, and we concur. We expect it.
Intrepid, Houston.
Go.
We have a update on the star Ar - Arcturus on page 102 of the Surface Checklist. We'd like you to use Procyon, 16, or Sirius, 15, and that's detent 1. [Pause.]
Roger. [Pause.]
Okay. And we passed self-test all right.
Roger.
Are you ready for E-Mod dump?
That's affirmative. We're ready for the E-Mod.
Intrepid, Houston.
Go.
If you will give us P00 and Accept, we'll give you a CSM state vector and RLS update.
You have P00 and Accept.
Hello, Houston; Yankee Clipper.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Loud and clear.
Well, hello there, stranger. How are you?
Morning, Dick. We are fine. How are you?
Well, pretty good. I hope you would like to have some company for a change.
Roger. Got the house clean?
As a matter of fact, I just finished that. I sure do; got everything in order; ready to go towards the LM and bring back [garble] that's quite a chore; keeping this thing clean.
Roger. You got a couple of coal miners coming up to see you.
That's okay. I'll be glad to see them.
Intrepid, Houston. The computer is yours. Break. Yankee Clipper, if you will go P00 and Accept, we have an uplink.
All yours.
Houston, you got the lift-off time for me?
Stand by. [Pause.]
Intrepid, Houston. Your lift-off time is l42:03:47.
I copy 142:03:47.00.
Affirmative.
Clipper, Houston. Computer's yours.
Okay. And Jerry, will you find out what they want to do about this battery charge, because I'm using the bus ties during the rendezvous?
Roger.[Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Why don't you figure on terminating the battery charge at LOS?
All right; I could let it go until I [garble] just before lift-off. That way it might take it all the way up.
Clipper, Houston. We prefer that you terminate at LOS on this pass.
Roger.
Roger. That would be one less thing for us to keep track of prior to lift-off.
Okay.
Say, Houston; Intrepid.
Intrepid, Houston. Go.
Roger. When you look out the AOT in the dark quadrant? You can see these lights - particles of light, flashes of light just seem to come from - in this case, I'm looking in quadrant 1 which is the left one. It's coming from behind me, the left, and they're just sailing off in space. I was thinking they're dropping from my water boiler, but it looks like some of those things are escaping the Moon. They really haul out of here and just press off at the stars.
Roger. [Pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston with a P22 tracking PAD.
Go ahead.
Roger. Your target is LM; T-1 is 139:57:39; T-2 is 140:02:38; south 05; latitude is minus 3...
Roger. T 112...
Latitude, minus 3.036; longitude over 2 is minus 11.709; altitude minus 1.13. If you want to take photos, your DAC settings are 1/60th, 1 over 60, one SP, 1 FPS, and C-EX film. You're - you should be at zero local horizontal rather than 22-degrees pitchdown. Over.
Roger. Understand. T-1, 139:57:39, T-2, 140:02:38, 5 miles South, latitude is minus 3.036, longitude over 2 is minus 11.709; altitude minus 1.13 and [garble] information. I will not use it.
Roger, Dick. And I've got a Rev 30 map update when you're ready. [Pause.]
Go ahead.
Roger. Rev 30, LOS 140:31:05; 140:56:06, 141:17:20.
Roger. Yankee Clipper, we copied.
Okay. And, Dick, I've got your consumables update when you are ready.
Go ahead.
Roger. At a GET of 139 plus 20, RCS total was 56 percent; Alfa is 58; Bravo, 56; Charlie, 56; Delta, 55; hydrogen tank 1 is 49.9; tank 2 is 49.8; oxygen, 52.7 and 54.4. Over.
Roger. I copy that. And my rendezvous radar transponder self-check is okay.
Roger.
Hey, Jerry, I would like to have a DAP update also, please.
Roger, Dick. Stand by. We'll get it for you. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. Looking at the DSKY torquing angles?
Roger. We see them, Pete.
Intrepid, Houston.
Go.
Roger, Pete. How's your drinking water intake then since you got back in? You been replacing quite a bit of it?
Yes, sir.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. If you'll give us P00 and Accept, we have another LM state vector for you.
Okay, Houston. I'm going to stop my roll [garble] here. Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. [Long pause.]
All right, Houston. Is there any objection if we track him when he goes by this time? And do you have the OSCIL[?], or don't you want us to do it?
Intrepid, Houston. We hadn't really planned on doing a P22 on this pass.
Okay. We'll forget it.
Okay. Break. Yankee Clipper, Houston. I've got your DAP update.
Sock it to me.
Okay. About the only change you need is you need to go to 0.5-degree deadband, so R1 should read 1110.1.
Okay. Are the weights and trim verified yet?
Roger, Dick. Your weights and your trims are good.
Okay. That's what I was worried about. Thank you. I'll probably go to a half a degree a second during the rendezvous because those maneuvers are pretty long.
Roger.
Houston, Clipper. Never mind. Forget it.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. We're through with your computer.
Roger. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston. On your maneuver, go S-band Omni Charlie. Over.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Omni Delta.
Houston, Intrepid.
Intrepid, Houston. Go.
Has Yankee gone overhead yet?
Not yet, Pete.
Give me an overhead time, so I can watch him go by.
Take T-2 and add 96, Jerry. [Long pause.]
Intrepid, Houston. Clipper should be overhead at 140:04:10.
Okay. Thank you. I'm going to check the plane change and see how good you are. [Long pause.]
Houston, Yankee Clipper. Is Intrepid up VHF?
Stand by, Clipper. Break. Intrepid, this is Houston. Clipper wants to know if you're up VHF.
No, but we will come up VHF.
Roger. Break. Clipper, Houston. Intrepid says he'll be up.
Okay. Ask him whether he wants us up VHF A or B Simplex.
Clipper, Houston. What would you like, VHF A or B Simplex?
[Garble] go on normal VHF ranging.
Say again, Clipper.
How about the normal VHF ranging [garble]?
Intrepid, Houston. Come up on VHF ranging configuration. Over.
Will do.
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Dick. Are you going to use the zero-degree pitch or 22-degree pitch down for this pass?
Twenty-two degrees.
Hello, Yankee Clipper; Intrepid on VHF. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Pete. [Long pause.]
Hello, Houston; Clipper.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Go.
Roger. Houston, I don't like those marks at all, that Sun angle was pretty high and the whole area is washed out, and it's the best that I could tell you, I think I was on the Surveyor crater but I can't be sure of that.
Roger, Dick.
That Sun's a lot too high to define that right now.
Houston, Intrepid. We had a visual on him although I couldn't talk to him on VHF.
Intrepid, Houston. Roger.
Clipper, this is Houston. Did you read Intrepid on VHF?
That's affirmative.
Roger. You sure it wasn't in S-band because, you know, we're in a relay mode.
Houston, Clipper. I think it's VHF, Jerry.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Hey, Jerry, I sure wouldn't do anything with that P22 data because I'm not sure of it.
Roger, Dick. We've copied your data.
Clipper, Houston. We'll give that data a good evaluation before we do anything with it.
Houston, Intrepid.
Intrepid, Houston. Go.
Got sort of an interesting thing going on AGS right now. I didn't notice earlier, but it may just be because the lights are brighter now. I'm getting an all 8's flash on both the address and the information registers at about one-fifth the brilliance of the normal numbers. And a - it's pulsing every second.
Roger, Al.
If I turn down the illumination level just a little bit, it's not noticeable. [Long pause.]
Hello, Houston; Intrepid. You ready for my RCS hot fire?
Intrepid, Houston. Roger. Fire away.
Okay.
Intrepid, Houston.
Go.
Roger, Al. Fredo is here. He and I have both seen that phenomena on your DEDA during testing of most all the spacecrafts up at Bethpage, and it's probably an EMI.
That's what we've been talking about, but we thought we'd just touch in on it.
When you go to your roll rate, roll left, pitch up...
Roger. I think TRW's got a workup on this problem.
Okay.
Here you go, Houston, with roll, pitch, and yaw.
Roger, Pete. [Long pause.]
Intrepid, Houston.
Don't panic. We just blew over our S-band erectable, and we're up on our steerable.
Roger. I was just going to tell you, Pete, we lost some of the data on that fire check.
Okay. You want me to give to you again?
Stand by. I'll tell you what we need.
I never gave you yaw anyway.
Pete, can you just start over from the beginning?
Okay. [Long pause.]
Pitch up is the only one that didn't sound right.
Intrepid, Houston. I've got a K-factor update for you when you're ready.
Okay.
Roger. R-1 is 00140; R-2 is all zips, R-3 is 00033.
Okay. 000 - 00140; all zips; three zips 33.
Roger.
Okay. How'd the hot fire look?
Intrepid, Houston. That went kind of fast. Give us a chance to take a look at our tapes.
Okay.
Intrepid, Houston. The passive seismometer just verified that you did do your hot fire.
Very good.
Does the passive seismometer say my hot fire is Go? [Long pause.]
Houston, Clipper.
Clipper, Houston. Go.
Okay; have the DSKY.
I understand I was Go.
Houston, are you ready for our gyro torquing angles?
Clipper, Houston. Roger. Go ahead. [Long pause.]
Intrepid, Houston. I have a LM ascent PAD and a CSI PAD.
Okay. Just a second. Are you ready for my - the rest of my hot fire?
Roger. We're ready. Go ahead. Break. Clipper, you can go ahead and torque.
Okay, I did. Thank you.
Okay. I gave you an extra pitchup fire because we were photographing the effects on the ground. It's quite spectacular.
Roger, Pete.
And we're ready to copy the launch PAD.
Roger. LM ascent PAD follows: TIG 142:03:47.00; Noun 76, 5535.0, 0037.0, plus 000.2; DEDA 47 is plus 37364, plus 05607, plus 58642, plus 56955; DEDA 465 is plus 00370; DEDA 546 is NA; ignition one Rev late is 144:02:09; LM weight, 10789; CSM weight, 35390. Over.
Roger. Copy 142:03:47.00, 5535.0, 0037.0, plus 000.2, plus 37364, plus 05607, plus 58642, plus 56955, plus 00370, NA, 144:02:09.00, 10789, 35390.
That's affirmative, Al. P32 CSI PAD follows. Noun 11, 143:01:50.60; Noun 37, 144:38, all zips; Noun 81, 0492, all zips; DEDA 373 is 01818, 275 is 02780; AGS Delta-Vs, plus 0492, all zips, plus 0010. Over.
Roger. 143:01:50.60; 144:38, all zero's, 0492, all zero's, 01818, 02780, plus 0492, All zeros, plus 0010.
Affirmative, Al.
Okay, Houston. I'm standing by for your up-data link and the LGC gyro compensation.
Roger, Pete.
Houston, this is Clipper. I copied those Pads.
Roger, Clipper. [Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, Dick. You can terminate your battery Bravo charge now, and we'd like to have you put your O2 tank 1 heaters and your hydrogen tank 2 heaters back to Auto. And dump your waste water to between 5...
Roger Roger. [Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper. Houston.
I have - got the H2 and O2 heaters, and dump the water to 52 percent.
Okay. That's it, Dick. Thank you.
And I'll do a purge next.
Roger.
I'll do a purge on the oxygen and hydrogen fuel cell.
Intrepid, Houston.
Go ahead.
Pete, we'll be setting your gyro compensation uplink to you after you've done your second P57.
Okay, must be a mistake in the checklist.
Yes, that's right. It's not - it's poorly placed in the checklist.
Okay. How'd the hot fire look all the way around? Everything okay?
Got another question for you, too, Houston. What did Yankee Clipper's orbit finally decay down to? How well did you hit 60?
Roger, Pete. It's 61.9 by 58.4 at CDH. [Long pause.]
Yes, that's pretty good, and we're targeted for zero CDH here on this thing, right?
That's affirmative.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston. We're about 35 seconds from LOS. You're looking good, and we're looking for an AOS at 141:17.
Okay, Jerry. Thank you.
Intrepid, Houston. How do you read?
Loud and clear.
Roger. Read you the same.
Houston, Intrepid.
Intrepid, Houston. Go.
Any objections to us starting P57 now?
Intrepid, Houston. We prefer that you wait until 45 in order to maximize the Delta-T there.
You mean 15, I hope.
Yes. That's right - 15. We were thinking in terms of lift-off minus 45.
I'm with you.
Intrepid, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Al. Would you put battery 5 on the line now? Before, it wasn't really carrying it's load as well as it should have, and we'd like to pre-precondition that one, get it a little warmer and get it started early.
Okay. I noticed that; we'll do it.
Okay. [Long pause.]
That's exactly what it did prior to descent - not much.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. How do you read?
Loud and clear. We're standing by...
Clipper, read you loud and clear.
Houston, Yankee Clipper. Read you loud and clear.
Roger, Clipper. Reading you the same.
Okay. Looks Go here, Jer.
Roger, Dick. [Long pause.]
Clipper, Houston. Your state vectors are all good, so there'll be no uplink to you this time. Your map update PAD is scratched, and I've got a landmark tracking PAD if you're ready to copy?
Roger. Do you want us to do this one, or can we skip it?
Stand by. [Pause.]
The reason I say that, Jerry; since I can't see them at these high Sun angles, it's pretty academic to do this one. I'd just as soon save the gas and skip it.
Roger, Dick. We're talking about it.
Clipper, Houston. The data is only in the event you want to try to watch lift-off.
Yes. I know that. I don't think I can see them, Jerry, so let's skip it. The sun angle's too high.
Okay, Dick.
Intrepid. Houston. Your gravity angle difference looks good and, there'll be no uplinks to you this time.
Very good, very good.
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Dick. Here's the Comm plan. About the time - When you get VHF communications established with Intrepid, we're going to dump the MSFN relay. If for some reason you lose it and you want to - you want to hear the - the Intrepid lift-off, let us know, and we can reconfigure in about 20 seconds; but we would prefer to leave the relay out as long az you've got VHF.
Roger. I think that'll be fine. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Boy, this place is fascinating, absolutely fascinating.
Pretty nice looking torquing angles, Intrepid.
Yes, sir. I like them.
Roger.
Intrepid, Houston. You're Go to East off on this Rev.
Roger - Roger.
Houston, did you copy the values [garble]?
That's affirmative, Al, and they're Go.
Houston, we're firing ascent 1.
Roger, Intrepid. [Long pause.]
Intrepid, Houston. Looks good.
Tank 2 looks good.
Bat's 2 and 4 coming off, Houston.
Roger, Intrepid.
Houston, Intrepid. Are you recommending VHF A Receiver On or Off for launch? Over.
Stand by, Intrepid. [Long pause.]
Intrepid, Houston. Need to have your VHF A Transmitter to Voice Range and Receiver, Off.
That's where she's at. Thanks.
Hello, Houston; Intrepid is on Vox. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Pete.
Roger. Checklist is complete; standing by for TIG minus 2.
Roger. [Long pause.]
TIG minus 2, 400 plus 10. Set your watch.
I set that at 1 minute.
Houston Clipper. I have the LM.
And start camera.
[Garble].
Roger, Clipper. Intrepid, Clipper's watching you.
Howdy, Yankee Clipper. Okay. Very good. [Long pause.]
On my mark, Yankee Clipper, it will be 1 minute.
Mark. One minute. Master Arm is On [garble]...
Okay.
367, Read.
I've got it. First stage push in 30 seconds, Pete.
Roger [Pause.]. Watch the ALSEP, and I'll fly the bird.
Sounds good to me.
Thirty-five?
DSKY's blank. Average g; abort stage...
Abort stage, push.
Engine arm, ascent.
All we lack is Pro and, then after, we get engine, start.
Okay.
Twenty seconds.
Looking good, Pete.
Okay. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5...
Arm.
Go.
3, 2, 1...
Lift-Off.
And away we go.
Boy, did it fire.
Yawing? Looks pretty good
[Garble] our descent stage - holding on.
Looks good. ALSEP looks good.
[Garble] It didn't get the ALSEP.
Intrepid, Houston. Copy ignition; guidance looks good.
Pitchover's looking good. Okay. Boy, you sure do [garble].
Nice and quiet, isn't it?
Firing like I don't know what.
Mark.
Thirty seconds. Thirty seconds; 177, 984.6, and out at 1900 feet.
That's pretty good.
We're on our way.
And at 1 minute, yaw right 20, Pete.
Okay.
Boy, there's that.
Say again? Pitch program looks good.
Kind of wobbles around up here [garble].
[Garble].
Intrepid, Houston. Looking good at 1 minute.
Okay. We've yawed right 20. Keeping right down the pike.
Okay.
What a nice...
Both tank pressures look good, Pete.
What a nice ride!
RCS, right in there.
Yes.
Sure jumps every time those thrusters fire.
Yes.
Flies smooth.[Garble] part of it.
Mark, 1 plus 30, 745, 156. We're out at 9,000 feet.
Too jumpy.
Okay. It's just changing CG.
I know it. It's still smooth.
What a neat-o ride.
It's a real good one.
This thing is pitching over. It's right on the pitch profile.
Mark.
[Garble] 2 minutes.
2 minutes. 1061, 175...
Intrepid, Houston. Go at 2.
...6. Just a little bit higher. Roger.
Everything looks good Pete, pressures look good.
Sure does.
Looks like the same territory we've passed over before, doesn't it? [Laughter].
PGNS and AGS agree?
Perfectly.
Roger. Okay.
Mark.
Two minutes and 30 seconds, looking at 1373, 187, climbing out at 19,700. Houston, you better clear me out of flight level 240 for flight level 600.
Roger. Squawk 21.
[Garble] right.
Okay. Squawking 21. How does your High Gain look, Al?
High gain looks real good, Pete. Hanging in there.
Mark.
Three minutes, 1752, 194, climbing cut at 25,000.
Houston, Clipper. If you can, have him transmit VHF also.
Say again, Dick.
Dick would like you to transmit on VHF.
Roger. I am transmitting on VHF.
Three minutes and 30 seconds, Al. 2,130 feet per second, climbing 193, and we're out at 31,600.
Okay. Camera went off sometime after lift-off. I hope it got the ALSEP.
It's still running.
I turned it back on.
Oh, I see. Wonder why we got the Master Alarm? Never did see anything.
No, I didn't either. Everything looks good.
Intrepid, Houston. You're looking good at 4.
Four minutes, 2513,...
Pressures look good.
...37, climbing out at 37,000.
Okay.
Oh, look at that Rille down there. Wow!
That was part of Lansberg, I think, down there on the left.
Hey,...
The camera stopped again, Pete.
Forget it.
Mark.
4:30. 2,954 feet. This is a hot machine. 173, climbing out of 42,800. Glad you're happy. Okay.
Helium pressures look good.
Hey, I can move around a little bit more now as we lighten up.
Okay. You've got a big job now. Don't forget the ascent feed [garble]...[laughter].
I've been thinking about them since we lifted off.
Okay. Five minutes.
Mark.
Five minutes, 3,403, 156 feet, and out at 47,000.
Intrepid, Houston. You're looking good at 5. The harbor master has cleared you into the main channel,
Roger. Really getting down there.
Look at that lunar surface, would you.
Okay. Five plus 30.
Okay.
Mark.
Man, look at that crater we're flying over.
Okay. I'm going to call it 500.
And - What are you doing?
Okay; 70, 100.
Okay.
[Garble] valve.
I think we got it.
1,400 feet per second to go. Okay. Get a mark at 6 minutes.
Six minutes, 6 minutes, 4,382. Okay, I'm going to get over on Verb 16, Noun 85 right now. This thing's running a little bit hot.
Okay. 900 feet according to the AGS.
Okay.
[Garble] It's sure picking up fast.
Okay.
Thirty-seven.
Okay.
There's a little bit more [garble].
Okay.
Standing by for...
700 feet to go.
Standing by for 200 feet per second. 621 to go.
600 feet.
Now you've got 500 feet to go. Wow, we're really bumping along.
Five - 475. 439.
[Garble].
Standing by.
327, Pete.
Okay. Main Shutoffs Open.
Okay.
Open.
Open they go.
System A didn't open.
Okay.
Going to close ascent feed, A1...
Looking good at 7, Pete.
...Get the Bus Feed on.
Okay.
It just opened.
Okay.
Seven.
Okay.
Pushing Abort Stage.
Engine Arm, Off. Okay.
Okay. Hey, I got to back off 32 feet [garble] thing. Agree to that, Houston? Master Alarm, but I don't know for what.
Everything looks okay.
[Garble] Houston [garble].
I'll tell you what happened. I got to watching that problem, and I let her overspeed.
Oh! Okay.
Okay.
But didn't...
[Garble] stage ready. I just figured we [garble].
Okay.
Houston, how do you read?
Loud and clear, Pete.
Okay. Does that look satisfactory to you?
Looks good, Pete. We copied your overburn, and we see you're turning now.
Okay. I took it all out. I've got interested in this...
Hello, Houston; Clipper. Still no VHF from Intrepid.
Main shutoff valve A indicated barber pole.
Roger, Clipper.
So I tried and recycled it twice and then shut off both ascent feeds and left the crossfeed open as it is now. And I'm going to close both of them.
Okay. Mode Control, two, up to Att Hold. They are.
Okay.
Inverter 2, Inverter 1, Open.
Okay.
And - on Inverter 2? I am on Inverter 2.
Okay.
Intrepid, this is Houston. Punch your Engine Stop pushbutton.
Yes. Did it. Sorry about that. Everything's off.
Okay.
Okay. Now...
External light to Track.
[Garble] let me get [garble] Gee, it's a dirty spacecraft in here.
Shall we go off Vox?
Yes.
Clipper, Houston. We're setting up the relay now.
I wonder why he's not transmitting VHF.[Pause.]
Intrepid, Houston. Clipper's not reading you VHF; we're configuring for MSFN relay now.[Long pause.]
Intrepid; Yankee Clipper, how do you read Houston, now? We're in the Relay mode.
Hello, Yankee Clipper; Intrepid. How do you read?
Intrepid, Yankee Clipper. Loud and clear now.
Intrepid, did you read Clipper's answer?
Yes, I read him.
Intrepid, Houston. Looks like you got a 47 by 8.8. Over.
Roger. What were we targeted for?
Clipper, Houston. Give us P00 and Accept. We have a LM state vector for you.
Okay, Houston. You got it.
Roger. On the way.
Intrepid, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Pete. Would you verify you're up on your forward VHF antenna? Break, Clipper, your computer's yours.
We're up on VHF antenna.
Thank you.
Roger, Pete.
Houston, Clipper. Did you see the DSKY?
We got it, Dick. Go ahead.
Roger. I've got some good torquing angles here. I guess you really don't need them, do you?
Negative. We don't need them.
Can you read us?
That's affirm. I read you now, Pete, loud and clear.
Okay. You be looking. [Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Okay, Houston. You're looking at the DSKY there, the torquing angles.
Roger. We're looking at them, Pete. Sterling.
Okay. Okay. We're going to Pro.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, Dick. How about turning down your S-band thumbwheel and make a VHF check. And, if you're in good shape on VHF, we're going to break down this relay again.
He's breaking now, Jerry; I can hear them now.
Roger.
Are you supposed to be on Ranging right now? I thought you were supposed to be transmitting on A.
Intrepid, Clipper. I have you in my big eye.
Very good.
Dick, I hold you at 351 feet a second, at 200 miles.
I concur on that, Pete.
Say again, Dick.
I concur. I concur.
Okay. I'm just starting P20.
Houston, Intrepid. We're going to go over to Omni now.
Roger, Intrepid.
Intrepid, Houston. You're about 45 seconds from LOS.
Intrepid, Houston. We'll see you at 143:16.
Roger - Roger. [Long pause.]
Intrepid, Houston. Your CSI Delta-V is going to be about 46.5. Over.
Roger. 46.5. [Long pause.]
Intrepid, Houston. We've got LOS on the Clipper, and we'll see him at 13.
Okay. Say again our AOS time?
Your AOS time is 143:16. It's nominal.
143:16. I got you.
Roger. Nominal in the flight plan.
Intrepid, Houston. Go Low Bit Rate.
Okay. Sounds good. I'll be working on out-of-plane here for you.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. How do you read?
Hello, Houston, Clipper. Loud and clear.
Roger.
Roger. CSI burn was good. Intrepid burned 45.3 feet per second. My solution was 45.9.
Roger, Dick.
Hey, Pete, your plane change is minus 0.4. [Long pause.]
Intrepid, Houston. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Houston.
Roger, Al. Read you the same.
Residuals PGNS were plus 0.1, minus 0.1, and minus 0.3.
Intrepid, Houston. We'd like to know what your Delta-Vs were that you loaded.
What do you mean, what Delta-Vs we loaded? We loaded 45.3 feet per second. Is that what you mean?
Affirm.
That was our CSI solution.
Okay.
Okay. And I've run CDH here, and it looks like minus 9 and minus 8 roughly. Shows me 59 seconds early at TPI.
Roger.
And we're not going to make the system look like we need to make the out-of-plane. We are down in the noise level on out-of-plane. Dick's going 0.4 of a foot per second; and I haven't looked at it yet, but I will in a minute.
Roger. Intrepid, Houston. Can you give us High Bit Rate, please? [Long pause.]
I tell you, Houston, I sure do enjoy flying this thing. It's - Both the ascent stage and the descent stage are both nice.
Roger, Pete.
For - for your information, I crossed that on the CSI burn, and that pretty evened me up, and I also switched my DAP load to system A.
Roger. Copy.
And my out-of-plane shows 0.31 miles and 0.3 of a foot per second, so I think we'll forget it.
Okay, Pete. That sounds good. While you got a minute, we had a question about the sequence camera. Did that camera stop right after lift-off?.
Apparently it did, and then it stopped again several times.
That's affirmative. It stopped, and then I started it, and it stopped two or three times.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Say, I guess nobody else has - Anybody else had to use these window heaters before? Our windows keep fogging over, and I have to run the window heaters all the time.
Intrepid, Houston. The folks here say that was pretty nominal on Apollo 11.
Oh, I didn't remember that. Okay. Very good.
Hey, Pete.
Go ahead, Dick.
My CDH time on my computer is 143:59:46:70.47.
Okay. We're within a couple - about 15 seconds of one another.
Okay. We're going to use yours.
Okay. 144:00:01.53.
I got it. Thank you.
Intrepid, Houston.
Go.
Roger, Pete. I sent you bum dope. 11 did not use their heaters.
Yes. I don't remember anybody having to use them, and both my docking window and - and both Al's window and my window - We collected moisture on the lunar surface and we've started collecting it here in flight, so I put the window heater back on.
Roger.
Sure do apologize, Houston, for the overburn. I got my head looking at Al there and I just shut her off late.
Roger. No sweat, Pete. [Pause.]
What did he do this time, Pete?
Say again.
What the devil did he do this time?
Well, he didn't do anything. We had one main shut-off valve that barber poled over here, and it turned out to be an indicator. But, I got interested in that and I didn't de-arm the engine soon enough, and we shut down about 30 feet per second over. That's the reason I had to back her up. No big deal. [Pause.]
Okay, Pete. My first try at it is [garble].
And what?
[Garble].
Okay, Dick. You're almost unreadable.
Clipper, Houston. Your S-band is getting pretty ratty.
Okay, Dick. I'm showing on 17.6.
Are you looking at the recycle on the DSKY, Houston?
We're checking, Pete.
It's minus 10 and minus 8.8.
Intrepid, Houston. We're watching. [Long pause.]
I finally - finally have a visual on Yankee Clipper, I think.
Roger.
Yes. I got you visually, Yankee.
I'm still leading by 122 miles.
Okay. I show 122 on mine, closing at 95 feet a second.
[Garble] That Omni PPI [garble] Hey, I saw your flash down there [garble].
Pretty close to that rim.
[Garble] on the Surveyor on the [garble] of that crater.
Say, Houston, Al's working so hard keeping his AGS updated here, why don't we let him burn CDH?
Roger, Pete.
Say again Jerry?
Intrepid, Houston. Stand by on that. We're consulting our oracle right now.
[Laughter] Houston, I'm only kidding, but he's all over the cockpit. Putting that range and range rate in.
[Garble] my burn.
I think we ought to rename the Intrepid the flying junk pile. You ought to see it inside this spacecraft, Houston.
Roger. Copy.
Okay. I'm minus 10.3. And my TPI's 2½ minutes early.
Okay.
Say, Houston. With - with your concurrence - we'd like to go over into the cabin mode for a while, stay suited though, but in cabin mode and try to get rid of some of this dirt before we dock.
Roger, Pete. Stand by.
Intrepid, Houston. Go ahead, use the cabin mode.
[Garble] canisters. Yes. Okay.
Intrepid, Houston. I've a PIPA bias update read-up for you.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Okay. Verb 21, Noun 01, Enter, 1452, Enter, 77423, Enter; Enter, 1454, Enter, 00406, Enter; Enter, 1456, Enter, 00777, Enter. Over.
Okay. Let me see if I got those numbers all right. Verb 21, Noun 01, Enter, 1452, Enter, 77423, Enter; Enter, 1454, Enter, 00046, Enter, Enter, 1456, Enter, 00077?
Intrepid, Houston. That's negative. Address 1454 should read 00406, and address 1456 should read 00777. Over.
Okay. 1454 is 00406 and 1456, 00777.
That's affirmative, Pete.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Hey, Al, have you ...?
[garble] burn [garble].
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. I've got some High Gain angles for you, Dick.
Go ahead [garble].
Roger. Pitch is minus 23 and yaw is plus 171. Over.
And we're on High Gain.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Pete, [garble] run your solution. I've only got 20 marks on [garble].
Say again, Dick.
[Garble] on that solution, we got enough marks here for five solutions. We ought to go ahead and press on.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston. We're going to have...
[Garble], Jer.
...a handover here now, in your case from Honeysuckle to Madrid. Over. At143:50.
Okay.
Very good.
Whichever way the world turns.
Pete, your out-of-plane for CDH is 0.4 plus.
Okay. I'm getting ready to [garble] final Comp.
I just fired one.[Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston. How do you read through Madrid?
Hello, Houston; Clipper. Loud and clear by me.
We read you the same.
Early, early, early, it's a minus sign. Seventy-five. Okay. Here's my solution. Delta-H is 0.8; 34.53 at 3 minutes early; Delta-V's, Noun 81, 10.3, zero, and 7.0. 7.0. would you read me your velocities again please? 5.3 is in Y, [garble] in Z. Okay. I copied minus 2.2 zip, plus 9.3. How about minus 10.2 and 7, [garble] for this 9.3?
Now, wait, wait, wait, Dick. Call Houston and have them relay it to me. I can't understand you.
Clipper, Houston. Go ahead.
[garble] That's okay. Go ahead.
Hey, Jerry. Just tell him I agree with his solution?
Roger. Break, Pete. Clipper says he agrees with your solution.
Okay. Very good. And, Jerry, tell them that our Noun 81 was - Where did you put it, Al? Minus 10.7, or is that 2, minus 10.2 and minus 9.3?
Roger. Copy. Noun 81, minus 10.2, and minus 9.3.
Roger - Roger.
That's affirmative.
And Clipper Rogered that. He heard it.
Hey, you got any thoughts on the ground, Houston, why our Comm is so bad between each other?
Pete, we're checking.
There must be something - Could you just tell us how to fix it?
Break. Did you get an out-of-plane from Dick?
We don't have any out-of-plane. It was 0.3 again or something.
That was 0.4, Pete.
Oh; 0.4 of a foot per second.
Clipper, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston; this is Clipper.
Roger. Just thought we'd better make a check with you and see how your antennas are. Are you on the starboard antenna?
That's affirmative. I'm on the lower antenna, lower right.
Roger.
The VHF is really horrible. [Long pause.]
Okay.
Okay.[Long pause.]
Are you going to burn? [Long pause.]
You're right, Al. I picked it up on the sextant. [Long pause.]
It's smaller than the LM.
I'm with you [Pause]. Let me know if I can help you. [Long pause.]
Do you want a countdown? [Long pause.]
Okay, Pete.
Burn complete, Houston.
Roger, Pete. Looks good.
Okay.
My TPI time was 144:34:54.87. That's pretty good.
144:34:54.87.
Roger. 144:34:54.87.
Okay, Al. Pick up on [garble] right here. [Pause.]
Yes, sir.
Okay. I got a time of 144:36:20.24. That's affirmative.
28.5 for TPI.
It was 12 seconds off. [Long pause.]
Ah, you're too easy. Still easy.
You get your light on again?
Hey, Pete?
Okay. That blasted Sun cut there is making it very difficult to take marks. I got five of them; six of them so far.
Good thing it doesn't bother the VHF any. I said it doesn't bother the VHF any.
Okay.
You guys got something flying along with you? Could be.
Hey, would you guys check your tracking light? It's dark out there, I don't see you anymore. [Pause.]
Well, I'll just keep looking here. Just hang on. [Long pause.]
Well, I sure don't see you. [Long pause.]
I wonder why you lost it. It was really great there the first night side pass.
Well, you're gone, Pete. I'll have to back you up on VHF and seven marks. [Long pause.]
Intrepid, Houston. We have a TPI solution here.
All right. We're ready to copy.
Okay. TIG at 144:35:52. We're getting a Delta-VX of 25.9; a Delta-VZ of minus 12.8. Your total Delta-V is 30.
Roger. That's very close. Our first cut was a V-total of 28.9.
Roger.
Hey, Jerry, what happened to your out-of-plane solution?
Clipper, Houston. We're seeing about 8 feet-per-second, but we don't believe it.
Oh, okay.
We don't either.
I knew you had to have something somewhere. Hey, you ought to see the Earth in the telescope, Pete; it's fantastic.
But I don't have you in the sextant. That's okay. Your blinking light's just not blinking, that's all.
Hey, Houston. It looks like our tracking light's burned out. Dick hasn't been able to find us in this sextant. And on the first night side pass we had little bits and pieces floating along with us and we could tell that the tracking light was flashing on them. And we still have, I've presumed to think, bits and pieces floating along and nothing's flashing on them, so I'm pretty sure it burned out.
Roger, Pete. [Long pause.]
Yes, sir. Okay.
Hi, Intrepid.
Okay.
This is Houston. How'd your sweep down fore and aft go?
It's getting much cleaner in here running this way; and, also, Yankee Clipper informs me he has the television all set up. When we come around the horn, we'll come around with the television on in Vox.
Roger.
Who knows, you may get to see the first whifferdill.
Roger, Pete. Our electrical watchers say that the current indicates that your tracking light is on.
Okay. Now we just turned it off. Now does the current show that?
It - It sure does, Pete.
You're - they're - You're flying through the air backwards, then, Pete, because I don't see it.
Well, my ball tells me I'm pointed at you, Dick, and so does my radar.
Well, you may have current, but you don't have any light.
Maybe that thing can burn out in such a manner that it still draws current - But that doesn't make sense, does it?
That's affirmative, Pete.
Oh, it can't do that?
Yes, it can.
Well, I'm pretty sure it's burned out. I don't see it flashing anywhere in the spacecraft, not that I remember seeing it before, but I did remember it on bits and pieces, and I don't see it anymore.
Yes. When's - when's LOS, Houston?
We've got LOS coming up for both of you in 3 minutes.
Okay. Very good.
You're only about 10 seconds apart.
Okay.
Okay. I've got a recycle going.
[Garble] Houston [garble].
Okay, Pete. Thank you.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Go Low Bit Rate. Pass that word on to the LM.
Will do, Jerry.
[Garble] S-band 500, 111. There it is.
Find the S-band yet?
Yes.
Where?
Where it's supposed to be.
Intrepid, Houston. How do you read?
Houston, Intrepid reads you loud and clear. We're 1.7 miles away from Yankee Clipper, closing at 38 feet per second. Right down the tube.
Roger, Pete. Break. Yankee Clipper, Houston. How do you read?
Hello, Houston; Yankee Clipper. Loud and clear. How me?
Roger. The same.
What do you have on the tube?
Nothing yet, Dick.
Okay. I'm going to roll a little more and give you some more High Gain.
Clipper, Houston...
38 feet per second.
Clipper, Houston. We're going to need about a 60-degree roll right to get to High Gain.
You're getting it. [Long pause.]
Pete, I have you at 1.2 miles.
I concur.
Boy, you sure look strange down there among all the sand dunes.
Sorry about that.
One mile, and I'm [garble] at 31 feet.
Okay, 1 mile, I got you at.
Okay.[Long pause.]
Clipper, Houston. We're getting your TV black and white now. Processing will be along shortly.
Okay. How does it look?
Looking good in black and white, and we think we can see Intrepid.
55 [he could be correcting himself here.] - 4,500 feet at 30 feet a second.
Roger.
Hold off a little more. Looks close now.
Huh?
Looks close now, and he's 4,000 feet away.
[Garble] in case I have to break for you. Hey, Pete, you're looking pretty good. I've got you at 0.6 of a mile.
Yes. Okay. About through a half a mile here, and going down. [Pause.]
Better run through that secondary canister for a while. This primary doesn't smell too good, either. That's our [garble] Both in Secondary?
All right. At half a mile; 19 feet a second, Dick.
Check. A half a mile.
Now, you're looking pretty good.
Okay. [Long pause.]
You look pretty darn good yourself. Out at 2,000 feet.
Clipper, Houston. We've got good color now. Looking good.
Okay, Pete, I've got you at one-third of a mile. 2,000.
Okay.
Looking good. How can you look so good if you're so ugly?
Say again.
How can you look so good when you're so ugly?
I don't know, You look awful good yourself.
1,500 feet, Dick.
Okay.
Intrepid, Houston. Give us High Bit Rate, please.
Okay, Houston.
Eight feet a second at 1,200 feet. Clipper, moves out there when you give her maximum thrust. [Pause.]
Five feet a second.
Okay, Pete, you're looking good. Keep it coming.
Okay. Thousand feet.
Let her coast in.
Antenna is in, now [garble].
Huh?
I'm punching this antenna. Okay right now. [Long pause.]
Exterior light off.
It's off.
Omni aft on the midleft.
Omni aft [garble].
[Garble] feet.
Say again.
I said 900 feet.
Yes. I got 800.
Okay. [Long pause.]
You're looking better all the time, Yankee.
Yes, keep going; I still have some film left. [Long pause.]
500 feet.
Check. I've got you at 540. [Long pause.]
Okay, I'm down to 3 feet a second.
Is your tracker light on?
No. We'll turn it on for you.
No, you don't have one.
Okay. We'll turn it back off. [Long pause.]
Two feet a second, Dick, 200 feet. [Long pause.]
Okay, the radar broke lock, Al; would you take care of it?
Okay.
I'll go to the checklist.
Okey-dokey.
How do you read me, Dick?
I read you loud and clear, Pete; you look awful good. How come you didn't bring the docking target back with you?
Say again.
How come you didn't bring the docking target back with you?
You're almost unreadable. Relay through Houston.
Roger, Intrepid. He wants to know why you didn't bring the docking target with you.
Oh, I got it. On the top.
Pete?
Yes.
Want me to start right there?
Yes, Verb 34, Enter.
Okay. Verb 34, Enter. [Long pause.]
Let me put down that number. Might be a good one to remember.
Hello, Houston; Clipper.
Clipper, Houston. Go. We can see thrusters firing now.
Okay. Am I clear for Pyro Arm?
You're Go for Logic, Dick.
And I'll have the T-6 [?] Logic on for you in a minute. Okay, here's the Logic.
Clipper, Houston. You're Go for Pyro Arm and stand by to receive the skipper's gig.
Aye-aye, sir. Okay, Pete. Why don't you let me finish this roll, huh?
Do your what?
Let me finish this 180-degree roll. Okay?
I don't understand what he's saying, Al; do you understand?
No.
Intrepid, Houston. he's going to finish his roll maneuver now.
I'm working on it.
All right [garble] Two rolls, Dick, and I'll fly wing on you.
Okay.
Look at that S-band antenna of his [garble] track.
Is it moving?
Also, that is extremely interesting. Look at the cover on the [garble].
Huh?
Okay. Cover on what?
Look at the umbilical cover. Do you suppose that's where it got hit by lightning or something? What's made it brown? Look at the top of it; it's burned.
Yes, I do believe that's where it got hit.
No. Maybe it gets burned by other...
Maybe we better find out. Why don't you move over to the left a little bit? And I'll take a picture of it, and they can look at it later.
Hey. Can you drop down a little, Pete?
Can I do what?
Drop down.
Down.
Yes. Towards the Moon.
Towards where?
Toward the Moon.
Oh, yes; okay.
Okay, Pete...
How much farther down you want me to go?
Well, go down so I can see you; I've lost -I'm losing you now.
You don't have me?
No. Get down towards the Moon; you're going below me, below the spacecraft.
Oh, I think he wants me to...
That's right. He's upside down.
Oh, I'm sorry, when you say down - that's up to me pal; I'm upside down.
I said towards the Moon.
Sorry, I don't know where the Moon is; I just...
It's right there.
Now, you see me?
Okay. Go. I got you.
Okay.
Now, do your maneuvering.
All right, let me stop my radar - have you got it?
I've got it.
You've got it.
Okay, you need to pull both rendezvous circuit breakers.
Okay, wait just a second. Is the rendezvous radar in the right place?
It's 320, 320, which is where it should be.
Okay. Got those out. Rendezvous radar breakers are pulled from the Verb 44.
Intrepid, Houston. If you get a chance, we would like that picture.
He took it already, Houston.
Good show.
Started 9 take it with the movie camera, but - hey, he's got something sticking out around the top of him too; you ought to take a look. Right up there.
On the top, Pete.
Wait a minute; I [garble] on my checklist here.
All right.[Long pause.]
Hey, overhead window. Read me the rest of that, Al.
Okay. External lighting to Dock.
Okay.
Which it is. And - that's it.
Okay. Here I come...
No, wait. Why don't you take a look at what ever is swinging on top of the spacecraft; see it?
It's probably part of the SEP package.
I bet it is. I bet you're right [garble] back to back.
Get a picture of that?
I tried to.
All right, Dick, I'm going to pitch over 90-degrees now.
Okay, let's go.
Okay, I'm going Omni aft, Houston.
Roger, Intrepid.
Let me have this one [garble]. [Pause.]
My antenna's okay.
Okay. Pitch down 90 and yaw...
You're right, Pete. Now look, [garble] right now.
Intrepid, Houston. Give us Low Bit Rate.
Will do.
Okay, Dick. Now, I'm going to yaw left 120.
Okay. Go ahead; I'm ready.
Okay.
[Garble]. [Pause.]
Okay.
Okay.
Pete [garble].
90.
That's not enough. That's good.
Okay.
Okay. There's another one for you.
Okay. Verb 77.
I've got Verb 77, but I'll do it again.
0kay.
What else?
[Garble] contact after hard dock. Mode Control both Off. After the hard dock.
Okay. Yes.
[Garble] down there. [Long pause.]
Hey, Richard. You didn't set up the rendezvous target for me.
[Garble] your picture taken instead.
Okay.
Hey, we're looking good and closing. Right on the money.
Okay. Looks good here.
Okay.
Looking good; looking good. That a boy! [Garble] up a little bit. Looks good, Dick.
Got capture?
Capture.
Okay, go Free.
Free.
Very good. We're in good shape. Go ahead [garble].
That's what there was supposed to be, wasn't I, was Free?
Yes, sir, you're looking good. Stable as a rock. Go ahead.
Wait a minute; just let me stabilize a little bit.
Okay, it looks pretty stable to me.
Think so, huh?
Huh?
I want to put you down just a little bit.
Okay.
Let the dynamics die out just a little.
Okay. It's hardly moving at all.
Yes, but the target, I want for you to come down a little bit.
Okay. Steady as a rock.
Okay, I'm getting it down there with the attitude. It's okay. Okay?
Go ahead.
Are you ready to retract?
I'm ready to retract.
Okay, Charlie Brown, here you go.
Okay. [Pause.]
And you're home free, boy.
[Garble] beautiful.
Both drogue latches are out, pal, and you got it.
Thank you, thank you.
Super job, Richard. That was smooth, wasn't even a ripple. Okay, read me the checklist there, Al.
Okay. Mode Control, AGS at Hold.
AGS at Hold.
Attitude Control, three of them pulled.
Pulled.

Hello, Houston; Clipper.
Clipper, Houston. Go.
Roger, that's the end of the TV show. We've got some work to do.
Roger. We can see Pete through the window now.
Well, I'll leave it on for a little while then.
Hello, there.
I've got a 12021.
Roger, Pete. We can see your nose from here.
That's my sunglasses I've got on in my helmet.
12021.
Intrepid, Houston. I've got some S-band angles for you.
The Marines are picking on us again.
Intrepid, Houston. Negative on the angles.
Go ahead.
Okay. Houston, I've got 5,838 in for the LM weight 35,389 in for the CSM weight. Is that good enough?
Stand by Pete.
Those are blank on my checklist, so I'm...
I believe you're right. I believe lightning must have hit right on the front of that [garble].
Well, I'm not sure that [garble].
[Garble] look around [garble].
Where are you going to, Richard?
I'm just wandering, Pete. I've got it in 10-degree Deadband plus or minus 5.
Okay.
Intrepid, Houston. I got your weights.
All right, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, LM weight is 5,334, and CSM weight is 35,600.
Copy. LM weight is 5,334, and CSM is 35,600. Very good. [Pause.]
Roger. Break. Clipper, did you copy?
Houston, I just put 5,500 in for the LM. Is that close enough?
Clipper, the LM weight is 5,334; and if you're ready to copy, I've got your trims for you.
Listen, I don't really need those things, do I?
Okay, we'll skip them.
Hang on to them in case we need them, though, Jerry. I've got to get to work and get that tunnel pressurized.
Roger. Go half degree deadband.
I'm in plus or minus 5-degrees. I can save some fuel that way.
Houston, Clipper.
Clipper, Houston. Go.
I expect the folks are a little bored with that scene now. I'll turn the television off with your concurrence.
Roger. We concur.
How was the show?
Very, very good, Dick.
Okay, the TV is off.
Clipper, Houston. You did a great job of docking.
Boy, that was a super job.
The way you guys stuck it out there in front of me, all I had to do was drive it in. [Long pause.]
Intrepid, Houston, go Updata Link to Data. Your S-band antenna angles are pitch, 176; yaw, 59.
Thank you, Houston. We'll try it.
Hey, Pete, is your Forward Dump in Auto?
Yes.
Okay.
Yankee Clipper mid Intrepid, we're ready to start uplinks to you. Who would like the first one?
Yes, Clipper is ready.
Roger. Give us P00, and we'll start it up.
It's all yours.
Intrepid, Houston. High Bit Rate. [Pause.]
Intrepid, Houston. Give us High Bit Rate. Over.
Roger, we'll give you High Bit Rate.
We gave it to you, Houston. Maybe you're just not catching it.
Roger. We copy now. [Long pause.]
Say, Houston; Intrepid. What time is it back there, anyhow?
It's just about high noon. It's 9 minutes after 12.
Oh, I - I've completely lost all sense of night and day. A1 said, A1 wants to know what day it is.
20 November, 20; and it's Thursday.
Okay. Thursday, Roger.
Intrepid, Houston. If you'll go P00 and Data, we've got an uplink for you, and go Updata Link to Data. Over.
You got it, Houston.
Clipper, Houston. The computer's yours. [Long pause.]
Say, Houston, while you got a minute, I'd like to talk over something with you.
Go ahead, Pete.
When we were on the back side then coming around, I don't remember exactly what time it was, coming up on - what was it, midcourse correction - coming up on a midcourse correction, we got an ECS light with a partial pressure CO2 and went over seven. And that kind of surprised me, and we did switch the canister secondary, and sure enough the CO2 gage went to zero, and like it was starting on a fresh canister. I don't think the canister that we put in, which was at 130 hours, that's only 15 hours old, should have done that. I'm wondering if maybe I ought to take a look at that canister and see if it's wet or anything.
Roger, Pete. Stand by. I think we've got some words on that.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Hey, Pete, got to take the hatch out.
Is that what you said, Dick? We can open the hatch?
Intrepid, Houston. The computer's yours.
Roger.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Got a CSM separation maneuver PAD for you and a LM Jettison attitude and a LM Jett time.
Houston, this is Clipper. You're going to have to hold those. I'm busy up here in the tunnel.
Okay. You'll just give me a call when you're ready for them.
Intrepid, Houston. I've got PAD for you when you're ready to copy.
Might go over the hill. Hey, Jerry, don't let him go over the hill without getting them.
Okay.
Intrepid, Houston. You ready to copy Pads?
Negative, Houston. But we will be in just a minute; I'll give you a call.
Okay.
Hey, Pete. Hey, Conrad. Hey, Commander Conrad. Pietro! where are you?
Yankee Clipper, Intrepid. Are you giving us a call?
No, we're talking to each other. Sorry about that.
Okay.
I've got my helmet on, Dick. I can't see you down here. [Long pause.]
Houston - Houston, Intrepid. We're ready to copy those Pads.
Roger, Intrepid. The first PAD will be a P30 LM maneuver; call it LM impact or LM final. Are you ready?
Ready to go.
Roger. Noun 33: 149:28:17.50; Noun 81: minus 0181.2, plus 0060.3, minus 0001.5; Noun 42 is NA; burn time, NA; FDAI: 162, 358; AGS: minus 0181.1, plus 0060.3, minus 0002.8. The rest is NA.
Roger, Houston. 149:28:17.50; minus 0181.2, plus 0060.3, minus 0001.5; NA; NA; NA; NA; 162, 358; minus 0181.1, plus 0060.3, minus 0002.8.
That's affirmative, Al. A couple of Flight Plan updates for you. Number l: we would like for you to bring back the sequence camera and stow it in Alfa 8 and no bag will be required. Over.
Understand.
Roger, Al. Also, on panel 16, would you pull your LM tracking light's circuit breaker? Over.
Way ahead of you on that one.
Hello, Houston; Clipper.
Go ahead, Clipper.
I'm ready for those Pads.
Roger, Dick. Would you put your Tape Recorder forward switch to Forward, please?
Okay. It is.
Okay, the first one will be your separation burn PAD. Separation maneuver follows: roll, 180; pitch, 343; yaw, 000; GET of TIG is 148:04:30; Delta-V; 1 foot per second; burn, Z-axis, retrograde. Over.
Roger. CSM separation attitude 180; pitch, 343; 000 in yaw; TIG, 148:04:30; Delta-V, 1 foot per second; Z-axis, Retro.
Roger. This is your Jettison PAD. Your roll angle is 220; pitch is 358; yaw is 352 - correction, 342; GET of Jettison is 147:59:S0. Over.
Jettison altitude: roll, 220; pitch, 258; yaw, 342; Jettison time 147:59:30.
Roger, Dick and the last one in your CSM P76 PAD. GET of TIG is 149:28:54.5; Delta-VX, minus 0181.1; Delta-VY, plus 0060.3; Delta-VZ, plus 0003.6.
Roger. Copy 149:28:54.5; X, minus 0181.1; Y, plus 0060.3; Z, plus 0003.6.
That's affirmative, Dick.
And what was that, anyway?
That'll be the...
In other words, now that I've got it, what do I do with it?
If you want to track the LM, Dick, this is the data that you need for tracking.
Oh, that my P76 PAD. Okay?
Thank you, Jerry, I understand.
Roger, Dick. [Long pause.]
Intrepid, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Al. When you get a moment here, before you go LOS, we've got a couple of items. Number l: We'd like a few more words if you can on what it was you saw dangling from the CSM; I think you called it a separation package or something like that, and also we'd like to see you go back to your primary LiOH canister, and give us a look at it and see if it goes off on the CO2, again.
Okay, we'll do that. We're a little bit suspicious of it because we had some erratic readings with our CO2. We'll go back to primary right now - Houston, the - It looks like some of the stuff we used to get back at the SEP plane on Gemini, except it looked like a piece of metal - it was about 3 feet long and about an inch wide, that was just curling up off the back there, right at the SEP plane.
Roger, Pete.
Clipper, Houston. I've got a Rev 33 map update for you.
Hey, Jerry, can we skip this one? We're kind of busy right now.
Sure can, Dick.
Okay. Just holler at us when we go around the corner. We'll be looking for you.
Okay, that takes care of the paper work for this pass.
Thank you, pal. [Long pause.]
How long before LOS, Houston?
We've got 18 minutes and about 30 seconds now.
Roger.
Dick, can you take a look in the tunnel?
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Dick. When you get a second, I've got some DAP data for you and a couple of switches for you to check.
Okay. Will I need the DAP data?
Yes. It looks like a couple of registers need changing.
Go ahead with it.
Roger. R-1 should be 61101; R-2 is 01111. and check your A-C Roll, Auto Select valve switches to the Off position. And UPTLM to Block. Over,
Okay. Okay, Jerry. I'll get that after a bit, but I'm still trying to get this stuff over here to the CSM.
Okay, Dick.
Hey, Pete. I'm maneuvering to the Jettison attitude. Don't let it worry you. Don't worry.
I won't. [Long pause.]
Can you get it?
I think so. [Long pause.]
Yes, Pete. I think so.
Yankee Clipper and Intrepid, this is Houston. We're 1 minute from LOS. We're looking for AOS at 147:12. Over.
Intrepid, Roger.
