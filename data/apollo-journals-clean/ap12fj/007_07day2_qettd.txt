Houston, 12.
12, Houston. Go.
Roger. Battery vent is - Battery compartment has been vented and we started charging Bat A at 31:37.
Roger, Pete.
Houston, we just got a Master Alarm with nothing on the panel. Got any idea what that might have been?
Stand by, 12. We'll start checking.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Go.
Roger. We don't see much out of the ordinary, Pete. We are on a low bit rate right now, and we will be in high bit rate shortly where we can look at things a lot more closely. About the only suspicious item is your O2 flow rate is just a shade high, but we see nothing else.
Okay. We're venting the - the urine system - that new one, and we're just letting it run. I'll go shut her off.
Okay, Pete.
Looking at the Earth down there, Houston, it looks like you are littler than a golf ball at arm's length now. Sure looks pretty though. The terminator looks like it's - it's kind of hard to tell from this distance - looks like it's passing somewhere just west of Tallahassee.
Roger, Pete. It's just getting dark out here now.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Your accumulator cycled just about the time you got that Master Alarm, so it may have been an O2 flow high, and you may have just had a flicker on your matrix panel.
Okay.
Well, Houston, we have settled down to a normal routine during the day.
Roger, 12. We'll have some scores for you shortly.
Hello, Houston. Do you read 12?
12, Houston. Reading you loud and clear on voice.
Roger. Did you get the transmission a little while ago?
We got a few words and a little bit of music, and then it quit.
Okay. I think you lost our antenna about then.
We're trying all these things we didn't have in Gemini, like toothpaste and shaving and - We are really having a ball up here.
Roger.
All dressed up and no place to go.
Oh, we're going someplace. We can see it getting bigger and bigger all the time.
Apollo 12, Houston. I have a little sports news for you.
Okay.
Roger. The Phoenix 200 is still in a hold status; they apparently couldn't get past the thunderstorms. And here are some scores.
We were...
Go ahead.
No, go ahead.
Roger. Some scores: Texas Tech 41, Baylor 7 - these are all finals - Texas 69, TCU 7; Arkansas 28, SMU 5; Rice 7, the Aggies 6; Northwestern 30, Indiana 27; Michigan 51, Iowa 6; Wisconsin 55, Illinois 14; Ole Miss 38, Tennessee 0; Missouri 40 and Iowa State 13. And the scores on the West Coast are starting to come in now. Dick, you'll be happy to hear Washington and Southern Cal are tied 7 to 7 in the third quarter, and Oregon is - in the third quarter - is ahead of oh - UCLA 10 to 7.
Jerry, I - makes me happy but I'll bet it doesn't make you happy, does it?
Game's not over, Dick.
We've been trying to look at the United States through the monocular, and it just looks like most of the States is covered with clouds. Are you having bad weather generally over the country?
We'll have to take a look at an overall map, but here in Houston, it's been CAVU all day and beautiful, a wonderful, clear fall day.
Okay.
12, Houston. Dick, I got bad news for you. A final: USC 16, Washington 7.
Boy, you sure changed that in a hurry, didn't you.
I didn't want to give you too long to gloat over that one.
I think you were sandbagging me, Jerry. I was about to bet you.
I should've waited.
12, Houston. I've got a weather map here for the United States. All up through the northeast part of the country it looks like it's either overcast or broken. And then in the Southeast and in the South and up through about the panhandle of Texas down into Florida it's all clear. And then, moving on further west, you get into New Mexico, Arizona, California, and you begin to pick up overcast skies again, all the way from Montana all the way down to Arizona. Montana has got a few broken and scattered clouds in the eastern side and then it's pretty bad over on the western side.
Yes, we - we could - We were having a hard time picking out exactly where we were looking at. Even with the monocular everything is now - tends to be brown - and having a hard time picking out the land from the water, but it seems like that part of the country that we can see is pretty well covered with clouds.
Roger. It looks like the whole West Coast is socked in
12, Houston. The weather system is a great big high sitting down over, oh, Gulfport - Biloxi area, so that's why we are so clear down in the Southeast. We have a weak high up around the four corners area of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona. And then everywhere else is just bad news.
I see.
How are our families doing, Jerry?
Haven't talked to them, but I'll make a few calls and give you some answers.
Okay. Appreciate that every day if you could.
We'll do her. Everybody is probably at supper right now, so probably catch them all at home.
Houston. We are just looking out of the window now and we were all talking about old project FSMOE. You remember that?
I guess that one doesn't compute, 12.
Say again.
That one doesn't compute.
Project FSMOE? Full-Scale Mock-up Of Earth?
Roger.
Hard to tell which one we've got out the window.
Is it blue or gray?
Pretty blue and white
Hey, Jer, somebody's probably already said this before, but - That place looks like an oasis down there.
Roger, Dick.
Houston, 12.
12, Houston. Go.
What's your preliminary look at the midcourse show?
Stand by a second, Pete. While they're ginning up the answer, got some nice warm words for you on your SPS burn. Evaluation shows that your ISP is within one tenth of a second, and your thrust is within 20 pounds on that engine so you got a real hummer there.
Very good. I guess we can thank Mr. Thibodaux for that one.
Roger.
Hey, Jerry, it says in the Flight Plan to perform housekeeping chores. We're having a devil of a time finding a housekeeper up here.
Who's the Junior man, Dick?
He's on the Exer-Genie right now. He thinks he made Captain already, but he's got a surprise.
Roger. Your next midcourse looks like about a foot per second.
Okay. So I guess maybe we won't need to do any of those, huh?
Roger. Looks real good for here anyway. Another little gem of wisdom we got for you here, when you entered PTC, you collapsed your deadband when you used Verb 37 Enter to get the P00, so just as a little helpful reminder, we want you to remember that when you come out, you're going to zap to your Noun 22 attitude as soon as you activate your jets unless you come out in SCS.
Okay. Understand.
We figured you already knew it, but we wanted to show you how smart we were.
Good, thank you
Houston, 12. What do you think now? I just redid a Verb 79.
Will that do it?
Roger. You just cured it.
Okay. I guess we called a P21 in there or something; we got curious to see how far out we were and that must have collapsed it.
That's affirmative, that's what you did.
Okay.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Dick, you listening?
No, Dick's not on the horn.
Okay. How about Al, is he listening?
I'm listening, yes.
Okay, Al. I checked home for you and Sue got back this afternoon from the Cape. She said to say yesterday was a pretty exciting day for her, kind of wet, too. And she wanted to let you know that she had attended a birthday dinner party that was honoring Vice President Agnew yesterday and had a real fine time. She says her Mom and Dad are there with her at home now. They just finished dinner, and the kids are headed for bed, and she wishes you Godspeed.
Thanks, Jerry.
Okay. Pete, I guess Jane and the boys are...
Dick's up now.
Pete, I guess Jane and the boys are out to dinner, I haven't been able to get a hold of them yet. And Dick, you up?
Go.
Okay. Barbara says that Barb and Norman and your mother are all there now, and everybody's doing fine, and they've had enough excitement for a while, thanks. And if you don't mind, they just as soon you lay off the spectaculars.
Why? What in the world has happened?
She said Aunt Dorothy is passing through Houston now, and she called in to say hello, and she said also to let you know that Bill Der Bing is there with them, and he's doing a great job.
Very good, thank you.
Hello, Houston, 12.
12, Houston. Go.
Say, you know, yesterday we talked to you about this stuff that's all over the windows, and on Dick's rendezvous window - window 2 - We've got some kind of a white deposit that's like a - I don't know, it's like an ash and it's not flush on it, it's built up in little humps and tabs of it sticking out, especially in the upper right-hand corner. What we'd like to do is photograph this for you. We don't have much to do right now. We thought we'd photograph these windows and thought maybe you'd come up with some recommended settings and everything. Seems to me I remember somewhere we had those procedures for photographing windows back in D or something because they were bad.
Roger, Pete. We'll get somebody going on that right away.
We expect this stuff will be long gone after re-entry.
Roger. We've been kind of dying to ask you too about the ice situation. How long did it take that to sublime off?
Well, now, that's a funny thing. The ice was sublimed off, but it's left a white deposit all along the perimeter of the number 1 window, that - that's on the black surface of the outside of that window, and it's up along the side of the window too. It's similar to the same stuff that's on the rendezvous window. Now, the ice that was on the inside of the outer pane in the number 1 window - that's sublimated, too, since we started PTC. We have a - a fine deposit of water droplet; whatever was in the water - has adhered to the window and that's all in streaks and dots and splatters, so we kind of think some of this may have come when - when the tower was jettisoned; we're not sure, and I guess what we want to do is try and photograph this as best we can for you to see - because I haven't heard before either.
Roger, Pete. How long did it take for that outer layer of ice on window 1 to sublime? How long was it before it was gone?
Yes, it didn't go until we were finally asleep last night or - we stopped looking at it. It was still there, I think, when we went to bed last night.
Roger.
12. Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. The polls are closed now and - soon as we get enough election results to give you a meaningful information here, we will run you up some returns.
Okay.
Apollo 12, Houston. I'm going to run to get a bite to eat right now and your friendly AFD is going to be monitoring the line for you.
Roger-Roger.
12, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. I've got some words for you on the camera settings.
Okay. Wait 1
Okay, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Step number 1: make sure the Sun is incident to the window but not shining directly into the camera. Step number 2: set the focus at 3 feet, and then do as best you can to hold your camera 3 feet from your target, realizing that this focal length is pretty sensitive to the distance. Your shutter speed is 1/250th. And if you don't have the spotmeter out, use an f-stop of 5.6 and take a picture of each window, and then go to an f-stop of 4 and take one of each window. And if you do have the spotmeter out and want to use that, then the only caution here is to be sure that the spotmeter is focused on the window or the target itself.
Understand, Houston.
Apollo 12, Houston, with some election news.
Go ahead.
Okay. About 10 per cent of the votes are in and counted now, and Mayor Louie Welch is leading his nearest contender, who is Curtis Graves, by 10,000 votes to 3,000; these are approximates. In the six City Council positions that are up for grabs, all the incumbents are leading at this time, and the housing code question in Houston is running about 8,800 for and 6,200 against.
Okay. Thank you.
12, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
We have a - some little bits of information here on the P23 that you've done so far. Also, it's generated a few questions that we'd like to ask. The first batch that you did showed a Delta-H of 49.2 kilometers, and the second batch showed 24.8 kilometers, and the marks that you took in each batch, in each set, were consistent. And the uncertainty both times was about 4 kilometers, so we've got four questions to ask you which might possibly help us decide which Delta-H to use. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. First question. Did you notice any difference between the horizons on the two batches; in other words, did you select a new horizon the second time?
Abso - absolutely, on the first one, they used top of the haze layer; on the second one, the haze layer was hardly discernible, used - what considered the true Earth horizon.
Okay, Dick, and the second question is - well, you've answered the second question essentially. We wanted to know if you used the same technique, or did you put the star below or above the upper part of the horizon, but that's answered. Next, is - were the stars...
Well, Jerry, the reason I...
Go ahead, Dick.
The reason I did that, the second batch, that haze layer was hardly discernible at all, and the Earth's sphere was so sharp at that point, that I used it.
Okay then, Dick. Then, I guess you're saying then that you liked the second batch better than the first hatch. Is that affirmed?
Apollo 12, Houston.
Go.
Okay. Did you get my last question, Dick? Is - I'm assuming that you liked the second batch better than the first batch then.
That's affirmative, it was much sharper, much easier to define the horizon on the second batch.
Roger, Dick. We kind of got the impression that the altitude seemed to be a function of the star of magnitude and we're wondering, were the star images pretty well focused?
That's affirmative. I didn't seem to notice that. The only thing I can say about the first batch is that they were at the very top of the - of the haze layer where it just starts to turn that very light blue, and I thought it was a lot further away than I expected it to be.
Roger, Dick. And last question, was there any noticeable stray light and was it different on each batch?
No, the optics appeared to be excellent, they didn't have any problem with stray light whatsoever.
Okay. Thank you, Dick.
Houston, 12.
Go ahead, 12.
We've been having a little discussion here on this photograph in the windows. We had the exterior color - I presume, really what you wanted was the CEX - HCEX rather than the normal color.
Stand by a second, Pete; I'll check on it.
Well - We were showing for the color exterior, the 368, that we should have shot at a much slower speed, so that prompted us to think you meant us to use the HCEX, and so maybe you'd better clarify that.
Okay. They're checking right now.
Thank you.
12, Houston. While we're looking for that answer for you, I've got an LOI minus 5 flyby PAD - maneuver PAD for you if you want to grab out a form.
Okay. Wait one.
Okay. We're ready to copy.
Roger, Pete. LOI minus 5 flyby, SPS/G&N: 62633, Noun 48, plus 0.90, minus 0.17; Noun 33, 078:27:16.61, Noun 81, plus 0068.4, minus 0206.0, plus 0579.3; roll, pitch, and yaw is 052, 217, 338; Noun 44 is NA, NA. Delta-VT 0618.6, 1:26, 0613.6; sextant 32, 184.6, 38.6; boresight is NA, NA, NA; Noun 61, plus 07.38, minus 169.95, 1165.9, 36231; GET 0.5 g's, 145:52:20; GDC Align stars are Sirius and Rigel. Roll is 256, pitch 152, yaw 069. Ullage, none. Other burn is SPS docked. The LM weight is 33585. Over.
Roger. LOI minus 5, SPS/G&N, and I may have screwed up on this 62633, plus 0.90, minus 0.17, plus 078:27:16.61; Noun 81, plus 0068.4, minus 0206.0, plus 0579.3; roll, pitch, and yaw 052, 217, 338; Noun 44, NA, NA. Delta-VT 0618.6, 1:26, 0613.6; 32, 184.6, 38.6, NA, NA, NA; Noun 61, plus 007.38, 1165.9, 36231, 145:52:20. The stars Sirius and Rigel, roll 256, 152, 069, ullage none, SPS docked, LM weight 33585.
That's affirmative, 12.
Hello, Houston; 12. Do you read?
12, this is Houston. Your read back was correct.
Okay. Very good.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Pete, you guessed us right. The data we sent you was based on HCEX film. So that is what you ought to use.
Okay. Thank you.
12, Houston. Can we put our headsets back on now?
Yes. That's Dick's music.
They're friends of yours.
Apollo 12, Houston. You might consider taking a stereo pair with that camera on the window.
Okay. We'll give her a try.
Houston, 12.
Go ahead, Pete.
Does it look like we are going to have to reinitiate the purge or not on the CSM?
Pete, dumping the tunnel down to 1.6 eliminated the requirement for it.
Okay. Very good.
Hey, Pete. If you're looking for something to do, we got a geology pop quiz for you.
Oh, thanks a lot.
Go ahead, give it to them.
Houston, 12.
12, Houston. Go.
We think we have the S-IVB in sight. We've - had a - an object which is in the same place all the time and appears to be tumbling. We've had it ever since yesterday, and it just seems to be tagging along with us, so I guess that's the S-IVB. It's usually out our center hatch window when our roll angle is about 35 degrees right now. Maybe that'll give you a clue, and somebody can figure out if that's what we've really looking at.
Roger, Pete.
12,Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Pete. That thing you saw off the hatch, at a roll of 35 degrees, we figured there's probably three possible answers. Number 1: it could be the S-IVB, or possibly a SLA panel, or it could be the backup crew flying trail on you.
Roger. Actually we have two objects out there. One's not anywhere near as bright as the other, so I think the real bright one's the S-IVB and the other one's probably a SLA panel. They're about 20 degrees apart. And as far as the backup crew goes, tell them we'll meet them on the back side of the Moon.
Roger, Pete. Best as we can tell down here now - best as we can tell down here now, the S-IVB should be near Denebola, and if it's SLA panels - correction, what you are saying now ought to be near Enif; is that correct?
Yes, it's near Enif.
Roger, Pete. And the words here are that the S-IVB is about 180 degrees away, near Denebola.
Okay. I wonder what that could be.
Okay. We'll go back to our drawing board.
The object's very bright - The object's very bright, and it's obviously something that's tumbling. It's tumbling about 1½ rev's per second, or at least it's flashing at us about that. And Dick - Dick is going to tell you what star it's near. He's messing with his chart right now.
Roger. We're standing by.
12, Houston.
Go ahead.
Pete, as best as we can tell, looking at things down here, on those SLA panels, we assume that they weren't imparted any great amount of Delta-V, like anything more than 1 or so feet per second when they separated. Your SLA panels would probably only be about 300 miles away from you right now.
That could be true but, gee whiz, when we turned around, I saw one of those SLA panels leaving the area at a high rate of speed; it looked to me like it was leaving us pretty - pretty rapid clip, like it got a lot more than a foot per second or so.
Well, since we don't really have any idea how they left or what their trajectory could be, it's kind of tough really to say just what the heck that could be.
Okay. We'll assume it's friendly anyway, okay?
Roger. If it makes any noises, it's probably just wind in the rigging.
Okay. Understand.
Houston, 12.
Hello, 12. Go.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 12.
Apollo 12, Houston. Go.
Roger. Huh?
Houston, if you haven't got anything to do down there, how about telling us where - what longitude line the terminator of the Moon is on.
Roger, 12. It's in work. Sure you don't want that geology pop quiz?
Al's all eager. He says give it to him.
Houston, Apollo 12.
12, Houston. Go.
Roger. We're getting close enough to the Moon now so that, even with the - the monocular, the Moon looks a lot like these photographs that you see taken from many of the observatories that are around the center. We were looking at it through the sextant a minute ago, and it really looks spectacular. It's starting to take on less of a silver color and more of a gray color when you look at it up close.
Roger, Al. Watch those color descriptions.
You said it.
Apollo 12, Houston. We're working on that question of yours. Also, it's about time now to terminate battery A charge. Over.
Okay. That's in work.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Go ahead.
That terminator longitude is between 7 and 8 degrees east. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Hello, troops. Looks like a good burn today. Good show. Say, Pete, we got some folks sitting next to us here who would like to get some Biomed data on the three of you tonight. Why don't you kick it around and give us a reply?
What do you want us to do? Keep our Biomed hooked up tonight?
That's affirm.
Okay. You want it on all three?
That's correct. One thing they'd like to do is to get a baseline to help them during the EVA. They'd like to get - Apparently they use some of that data for input to the equations which they'll be using during the EVA.
Sleep - stuff?
That's what we're told.
Okay. We'll leave it hooked up unless it bothers us.
Okay.
I'm not exactly sure how you get it inside the sleeping bag.
Okay. That sounds good. Thank you.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 12.
Hello, 12; Houston. Go ahead.
Hello, 12; Houston.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 12.
12, Houston. Go ahead.
Hello, 12; Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. The LM/CSM Delta-P is plus 1.7.
We copy. 1.7.
And we'll be bringing the purge line heaters on at 40 plus 35 per the Flight Plan.
Roger, Pete.
And what do you want us to dump the waste water to - 25 per cent or 15 per cent?
Let's take it down to 10 per cent this time. That'll give you a pretty good margin.
Roger. Ten per cent.
You folks have been pretty quiet. What's up?
Nothing. We're just exercising and listening to the tape recorder and looking at the Moon and looking at the Earth - or reading the books.
Roger. How's that tape recorder? Is the RPM up to nominal?
Yes. It works pretty good here in zero g. It works better than it does down there on the ground.
It just doesn't have much in the way of volume up here with a 5 psi.
How's that cloud cover over the Pacific at this time?
Well, Australia is real clear again, and it doesn't look quite as cloudy north of Australia. It's sort of a - It's got a rectangular shape to it, whatever the system is north of Australia there. It's kind of funny looking.
Roger. What's the smallest piece of land you can pick out? Can you see any of the Pacific islands?
No, we haven't - We can't see any of them. One of - Dick just says he can see Borneo right now. He's looking through the monocular.
You can't see it with your naked eye, though.
I think one of the problems is that - The only thing that we could see would be close to the curve. All the - the terminator - We're not looking at that much of an Earth and all the water in the Pacific that's close to the terminator has a very shallow Sun angle on it, and it's fairly washed out.
Roger. You still getting a pretty good glint off the surface then?
Yes. Dick says the subsolar point is just west of Australia. By the way, how far out are we now?
Okay. The board's showing a little over 140,000 - Stand by. We'll give you a little more accurate.
Okay.
Pete, you're now 137,720 out, and you're going along at 3,580 feet per second.
Roger.
Okay. We're going to ask the DSKY and see what it thinks.
Not bad. 137,750.
Roger. We're showing...
755 right now.
It'll only read to the nearest tenths, and the velocity is 3,579.
Roger. We're just about the same as you, Pete.
12, Houston. We have some unofficial results from the elections today. It looks as though Mayor Louie Welch was re-elected to a fourth term. His closest competitor, Curtis Graves, got about 59,000, and the mayor's up to 98 now. According to - that's the first time since, I believe, 1927 we got a fourth term for a mayor.
Very good.
Say, Al, is that Moon beginning to look a little bigger to you now?
It sure is. We were watching it through the sextant a while ago, and the features on the Moon are much more pronounced than they are - than we've seen before we left Earth. They looked almost like one of these strip pictures you see from an Earth-based telescope. The terminator is about 7 or 8 degrees east, and it's right on the edge of a maria and running through some of the terra, and it's very stark and beautiful from this point of view. I imagine tomorrow it's going to be even more impressive.
Probably be very impressive from a distance of around 3 or 4 feet.
That, too.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
12, if you hold off on the waste water dump and the fuel cell purge until 41:20, you'll minimize the effect on PTC.
Sounds like a good suggestion. We'll do that.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. Apollo 12 is dumping waste water and purging fuel cells.
Roger, 12.
Pete, can you see any ice crystals from that?
You can see the water dumps; there's no doubt about that. There's all kinds of it. In fact, they look like a regular snowstorm.
Does the snowstorm tend to hang around or does it move off pretty quickly?
It moves out pretty fast.
Hello, Houston; 12.
12, Houston. Go ahead.
Hey; Roger, Ed. I don't think that water dump did that PTC any good at all.
G&C concurs with that down here.
Dick, let us watch it a little while. We haven't seen you - much travel since you made that dump. You're around 25 degrees out now. We'll be keeping an eye on it and see which way you're going.
Okay.
Apollo 12, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
In looking at your - your angles here, it looks as though you might be pretty touch and go during the sleep period if you don't go ahead and re-initialize the PTC, and when you do that, give us a little better - a little better propellant margins. We'd like you to go ahead and reinitialize the DAP to 0.2 degrees per second rather than the 0.5 you have in there now.
Got you.
Apollo 12, Houston. We've got a state vector for you, if you'll give us Accept.
12, Houston. The state vector is in, and we're ready for the E-Mod, whenever you want. No hurry.
12, Houston.
Go ahead.
State vector's in; the computer is yours. We're also ready to pick up on the roll now, Dick; and we're ready for the E-Mod dump, no hurry on that. Also, we have a question; have you cycled the water quantity indicator switch recently?
Yes, which one do you want it in?
Your position - I guess you have it in Waste right now - is fine. No problem either way, we just wanted to know whether you cycled it because we saw a funny down here.
Well, it's in Potable right now, do you want it in Waste?
Affirmative, Pete. Waste is good.
What was the funny? Okay. It's in Waste, and what was the funny?
Pete, we saw the water quantity go from 101 per cent down to 72 per cent and remain there for a period of time and then work it's way back on up to 101 per cent, and if you had cycled that switch, that would do it. That's the reason for the question.
Okay. I don't really remember, but we may have cycled it a couple of times.
Okay.
Houston, 12.
12, Houston. Go ahead.
E-memory dump coming at you.
Roger. We're standing by.
12, Houston. We have the E-Mod.
12, Roger.
Houston, Apollo 12.
12, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Let me give you the onboard readouts: Bat Charlie, 37.0; pyro Bat A, 37.0; pyro Bat B, 37.1. We have no RCS quantities. The indicator is on Main A. Pre-sleep checklist is complete, and we'll be going to our Comm configurations for sleep here in just a minute. And we're still doing some housekeeping chores, so you'll see some Biomed on and off, a little bit, while we get ready to go to bed.
Roger, Pete. We copy. 37, 37, 37.1. And we have the RCS consumables if you're interested.
Okay. Ready to copy.
RCS total 80.9, A 78.9, 83.1, 79.2, 82.8. And that's at 40 hours even.
Roger.
And we are assuming a negative crew status report.
That's right.
12, Houston.
Go ahead.
Before you go on off to sleep, would you take the - clear the DSKY and do it with a Verb 45 or Verb 66 rather than 37?
Is there any reason why we can't leave the clock time up there?
Yes. We just prefer, although it's not a strong desire, to clear the DSKY so you're not working the relays in the DSKY, give you a little longer life.
Okay.
And, 12, your PTC is looking good; we expect less than 6 degrees excursion during the sleep.
