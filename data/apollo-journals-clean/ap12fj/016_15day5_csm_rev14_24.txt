Yankee Clipper, Houston. How do you read? [No answer.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston. How do you read?
Houston, Clipper.
Roger, Clipper; Houston. Loud and clear.
Roger. Good burn. Good burn.
Roger.
Okay. Break. Yankee Clipper, Houston. I've got a Rev 15 map update for you.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. LOS: 110:55:25, 111:20:01, 111:41:32. Over.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, Clipper.
Stand by, Intrepid. We're checking. Break. Clipper, go ahead.
Roger, Jerry. Could you send me a good LM state vector, please? [Pause.]
Second check shows it to be 59,000 feet.
Roger, Al. Clipper, Houston. We think it probably won't do you much good to have it right now. It'd be better later.
Okay.
Roger. Fox-corpen, 285; clear deck.
Hello, Houston. Hello, Yankee Clipper. Intrepid's up VOX.
Houston reads you loud and clear.
Yankee Clipper. Loud and clear.
Roger.
[Heavy static] Hello, Intrepid. Hello, Intrepid. Hello, Intrepid.
How are you?
Intrepid. Congratulations from Yankee Clipper.
Thank you, sir. We'll see you in 32 hours.
[Garble].
Okay. Have a ball.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Dick. Can you get the High Gain pointed at us? We'd like to dump that tape recorder.
Okay. My pitch attitude's 81. Let me get you some angles [Pause.]
Clipper, Houston. Did you copy that whole descent?
That's affirmative.?
Very good. Intrepid, Houston. You can close your Ox vent. Leave the fuel open for a little while.
Roger. Closing the Ox vent. It's Closed.
Houston, do you have the High Gain?
Roger, Dick.
[Garble] are you looking at the DSKY?
Roger. We're looking [Long pause.]
And, Jerry, did you get the torquing angles and the time?
That's affirmative. We have them, Dick.
Okay. Just looks like a good platform yet.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. How do you read? Over.
Loud and clear, Jer.
Roger [Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Over.
Houston, Yankee Clipper here.
Houston, did you copy the results of the AGS Cal?
Yankee Clipper, this is Houston. Would you check you surge tank switch and the On detent? They were seeing a little funny in it.
Intrepid, Houston. Go.
It's in the On position.
Did you copy the results of the AGS Cal down there?
That's affirmative, Al. Roger. Thank you, Dick.
It looks okay. It's solid up here, Jerry.
Roger [Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Clipper. We'd like to try something with your high gain antenna. Go to the Wide beamwidth and Auto. Over.
Okay. I'm in Wide and Auto.
Roger, Dick [Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Seems to be holding. Now try Medium beamwidth. Over.
Okay. You got Medium.
Roger, Dick [Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, Dick. You're about a minute from LOS. We're satisfied with your surge tank pressures. You - we'll take a little - look in a little while at your S-band - next time you come around the horn. We'll be expecting to see you at 111:40 Over.
Roger. 111:40.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. How do you read?
Hello, Houston; Yankee Clipper here.
Roger, Clipper. Reading you weak but clear.
Clipper, if you'll give us P00 and Accept; we'll start your update. [Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Hello, Houston; Yankee Clipper here. [Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Hello, Houston; Yankee Clipper. Loud and clear.
Roger, Dick. You in P00 and Accept and ready for an uplink?
That's affirmative.
Roger. It's on its way.[Long pause.]
Clipper, Houston. I have a Rev 16 map update and a landmark tracking PAD, if you're ready to copy.
Go ahead.
Roger. Map update Rev 16: LOS is 112:53:48, 113:18:23, 113:39:28.
Roger, Jerry. Copied 112:53:48, 113:18:23, 113:39:28.
Roger, Dick. P22 landmark tracking PAD follows: T-1 is 112:20:00; T-2 is 112:25:11; the landmark is number 193; and it's South 06. Over.
Roger. Landmark 193, T-1 is 112:20:00; T-2, 112:25:11; 6 miles South.
Affirmative.
Okay. I'll see if I can plot it in the same place I did last time.
Roger. You got something new to look at down there, too.
Let's - let's save them for the next Rev. [Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston. The CMC is yours.
Roger, Jerry. Thank you. How are things going on the surface?
They're doing great, Dick.
[Garble] the same [garble].
Clipper, Houston. Give us Narrow beamwidth.
Okay.
Houston, Yankee Clipper.
Clipper, Houston. Go ahead.
Is - Is Intrepid going to do a P22?
That's affirmative.
I'm getting acquisition P22. Looks good.
Roger.
Houston, tell him I show him locked on.[Long pause.]
Roger, Clipper.
Hey, Houston. Intrepid has a visual on Yankee Clipper.[Long pause.]
Hey, Houston. Relay to Yankee Clipper I've got him visually.
Roger, Intrepid. Will do.
Clipper, Houston.
Clipper, for your info, Intrepid has a visual on you.
Thank you.
Hello, Houston; Yankee Clipper.
Clipper, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. Do you have all the data?
Affirmative, Clipper. We have it.
Okay. The next time, I want to see you put that Intrepid right in the middle of the sextant.
Houston, Intrepid's ready to copy the consumables update.
Roger, Clipper.
This is Yankee Clipper. No, they don't. Tell them to get to work.
Roger, Clipper.
They're down there having all the fun, and you're doing all the work.
They'll get with it soon, Clipper.
Intrepid, we'd like to get to Yankee Clipper before LOS, and we'll be right back with you.
Okay.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. [Long pause.]
Intrepid, Houston. Go ahead with your description of the horizon, and we'll be breaking in to you as soon as we can get back with Yankee Clipper. We've lost Comm temporarily.
Yankee Clipper Houston.
Hello, Houston. [Long pause.]
Clipper, we read you with a lot of static in the background. We'll hold up until you lock on.
Houston, Yankee Clipper.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Just checking in on you.
Clipper, if you'll give us P00 and Accept, we'll ship you up the more refined state vector.
Okay, Houston. It's all yours.
Roger.
Stand by. I've got a [garble].
Roger.
Okay, Houston. Now, it's all yours.
Roger, Clipper.
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Clipper, we're having a slight delay on getting that state vector up to you. We're having a little TM problem. We have a P22 PAD for you when you are ready to copy.
Ready to copy.
P22. T-1; 114:18:30, 114:23:32. And that's South 04. Update to the Lat, Long, and altitude; disregard those numbers in the Flight Plan. Lat, minus 3.029; longitude, minus 11.708; altitude, minus 1.13. And on your map, LAM-7, the coordinates are 13.4, K.9.
Roger, Houston. Copy. T-1, 114:18:30; T-2, 114:23:32. South 04. Coordinates; minus 3.029; minus 11.708; altitude; minus 1.13. On LAM chart, 13.4, K.9.
Readback's correct, Dick. We have a Rev 17 map update for you, also.
Go ahead.
LOS, 114:51:47; 115:16:45; 115:37:55.
Roger. 114:51:47; 115:16:45; 115:37:55.
Readback correct, Dick.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. The computer's yours.
Thank you.
Hey, Ed, how come you haven't been giving me any TEI PAD?
Clipper, stand by on that. I think we'll work out the rendezvous solution first.
Oh, okay.[Long pause.]
Say, Dick, when you're looking for them in the sextant, if you look at the Head crater, we suspect that they're on the Northwest rim of Head crater. That's the Head of the Snowman.
Okay. Understand.
Houston, I have Snowman. And I believe I have the Surveyor from the northwest side of the Surveyor crater.
Clipper, Houston. We copy that...
And, Houston, it's cast a shadow; it looks like it is about - Oh, it's hard to distinguish; it looks like about a third of a crater in diameter.
Roger, Clipper. Copy you...
[Garble] I have. I have Intrepid. I have Intrepid.
Well done, Clipper. Copy; one crater diameter to the North. Is that affirmative?
I have him. He's on the Surveyor crater; he's about a fourth of a Surveyor crater diameter to the Northwest.
Roger, Clipper. Well done.
I'll tell you, he's the only thing that casts a shadow down there.
Roger.
He's got a fairly good sized crater just to the North and slightly East of him; out directly behind him; he is on the Surveyor crater.
Roger, Clipper. [Long pause.]
Al1 right, Ed. Now I'm directly overhead. He's a third of the way between the Surveyor crater and the head.
Clipper, Houston. Say again.
The Intrepid is just on the left shoulder of the Snowman. He is looking at me. He is about a third of the way from the Surveyor crater to the head. I see the Surveyor! I see the Surveyor!
Roger, Clipper. Good eyeball. Well done.
Hey, Ed. That's almost as good as being there.
Roger, Clipper.
Let me know when you have your data.
Houston, Clipper. Do you have your data?
Clipper, that's affirmative. We have it.
And, Houston, I'd like to do that again on each pass. You might think - about putting the camera on the sextant.
Houston, Clipper.
Clipper, go ahead.
Roger. Would you find out which film they want me to use for this picture session the next time around? The normal sextant landmark tracking film, which is C-EX, or the high-resolution stuff the - It's C-EX.
Clipper, understand. You want to know which camera to be using on the next pass, is that affirm?
No. I know which camera, Ed. Which film?
Copy. Stand by.
Color exterior or high-speed power exterior?
Dick, let's go with the color exterior.
Say again, Houston.
Dick, go with the color exterior for the next pass. Color exterior.
Ok - okay. Understand. Thank you.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. One minute to LOS. And we'll be giving you a P22 pad at AOS.[Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Thirty seconds to LOS.
Roger. I'll see you next pass.
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Hello, Houston; Yankee Clipper.
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Hello, Houston; Clipper here.
Clipper, Houston. Intrepid's started the EVA. They're 32 minutes in, and things are looking good.
Roger, [garble] they're out. Thank you.
Dick, when the Comm clears up, we'll give you a P22 PAD and a map update for Rev 18.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Houston, Clipper. Go ahead.
Clipper, would you go to a roll 180, pitch 345? At that attitude, you'll have to just roll a 180 for your landmark tracking. To get high gain, go to angle Pitch, minus 45; Yaw, 350.[Pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Do you copy?
Roger. And we're roll 180, [garble] 345.
That's affirmative.
Okay, Houston. Clipper on High Gain.
Roger, Yankee Clipper. We'll he right back with you.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. We have a P22 PAD for you and a map update for Rev 18 when you're ready to copy.
Roger. Go ahead.
P22: T-1, 116:16:51, 116:21:53, that's North, 8 miles. Your DAC settings are 1/60th, 1 frame per second, and that's the color film.
Your map updates for Rev 18: 116:50:14, 117:15:07, 117:36:22. Do you copy?
This is Clipper. Roger. Can I use my last coordinates for Surveyor and Intrepid?
Clipper, say again.
Can I use my own coordinates for Intrepid?
Roger, Clipper. We copy.
Music - Teabury Shuffle [Tijuana Brass].
Thanks for the music, Clipper.
Hello, Houston. This is Yankee Clipper. I'm [garble].
Clipper, you were broken up. Say again.
Who are you talking to?
Pete, we have Clipper both - and you both on the same air-to-ground...
Houston, this is Yankee Clipper.
Clipper, go ahead. Say again.
Houston, Yankee Clipper. I marked off Snowman with the telescope, and we're going to get some good pictures from that one.
Roger, Clipper.
Houston, Yankee Clipper. Do you have the DSKY?
Stand by, Clipper.
Clipper, Houston. We're watching the DSKY.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. High Gain Antenna; Pitch, minus 13; Yaw, 225.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. One minute to LOS.
Hello, Yankee Clipper; Houston.
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Hello, Houston; Clipper here.
Dick, the EVA - EVA is going pretty well; they're 2½ hours into it; and they've, got the ALSEP a good way deployed. Apparently both of them look as though they just crawled out of a coal bin. Other than that, seems pretty much nominal.
Very good. Thank you.
Roger, Al. Yankee Clipper, we have a map update for Rev 19. [Pause.]
Okay.
Rev 19: LOS 118:48:40, 119:13:30, 119:34:33.
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Go ahead.
Yankee Clipper, if you'll give P00 and Accept, we'll ship you up a state vector, a target load, and a REFSMMAT.
[Garble] has got it.
Roger.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. We're coming up with a load.
Houston, Clipper.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Houston, do you have a manoeuver pad for me?
That's affirmative. We'll be up with you in about 2 minutes.
[Garble].
Yankee - Yankee Clipper, Houston. I have the manoeuver PAD when you're ready to copy.
Go ahead.
Dick, purpose, Lunar Orbit Plane Change 1, SPS/G&N: 36733 minus 0.73, plus 0.51, 119:47:12.54, minus 0011.5, plus 0349.6, minus all balls. Roll, pitch, and yaw, all zeros, 0062.5, plus 0057.3, 0349.7, 0:18, 0337.1, 05, 002.6, 18.7.
Dick, for boresight, Draco Beta.
And that's down 007, right 46. The remainder is NA.
Sirius and Rigel [pause] for your alignment 047, 263, 055 and thats two jet ullage 15 seconds, readback?
Hey, Houston; Yankee Clipper.
Clipper, go ahead.
If you want to talk to me, you'll have to take it off of relay so that Pete and Al won't cut you out.
Okay, Clipper. Understand. You did not copy all of that PAD. Is that affirm?
That's affirmative. It's impossible with those guys yakking.
Pete and Al, Houston.
Okay. That'll be a goodie.
Go.
Go ahead.
We're trying to get a manoeuver PAD up to Clipper; he's having a hard time copying it with you talking in the background. Could you - could we have some silence for about - for about 5 minutes, while we get that PAD up?
Yes.
Okay. We'll be right back with you. Clipper, Houston. Are you ready to copy?
Go, Bill.
Lunar Orbit Plane Change 1, SPS/G&N: 36733, minus 0.73, plus 0.51, 119:47:12.54, minus 0011.5, plus 0349.6, minus all balls; roll, pitch, and yaw, all zero; HA 0062.5, plus 0057.3, 0349.7, 0:18, 0337.1, 05, 002.6, 18.7, and that's Draco Beta; down 00.7, right 4.6, the remainder is NA. Sirius and Rigel - Roll, pitch, and yaw: 047, 263, 055; the ullage is two jets for 16 seconds. Read back.

Read back correct, Dick.
Okay, thank you.
Pete and Al, we're back with you.
Houston, Yankee Clipper. You have the DSKY?
Standby, Clipper.
Clipper, Houston were watching your DSKY's.
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Hello, Houston; Clipper here.
Clipper, you were sort of a forgotten man for a little while. We're all - all eyes are on you now. We're with you.
And, Clipper, the EVA was completed.
Okay, Ed. I've got a little - will you clean up that [garble] channel? I've got an echo in here.[Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, how do you read?
There you go. Now, you're nice and clear.
Roger. They completed the EVA with a 4-hour, 1-minute EVA, and they got all of the objectives accomplished. They did a real swell job, and we're watching you, Dick.
Well, I guess I'll go Vox, so it'll be easier for you people to follow on these onboard checklists as I go down here.
Roger, Dick.
Nobody is checking on me today.
We're watching you now, Babe.
Okay, I have everything down to 6 minutes - it's all done.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, I'm going to slide across the ballroom and get the Bus Ties.
Roger.
Okay, the Bus Ties are On MTVC Servo Power 1, AC 1/Main A; 2, AC 2/Main B; Rotational Hand Controller Power, Normal, two, AC; Direct, two are Off; BMAG, three, ATT 1/RATE 2; Spacecraft Control's to SCS; Rotational Hand Controller number 2 is Armed. And we'll go into Primary TVC check. Gimbal motors: Motor l, Pitch 1; I've got it - one, Yaw - mark, I've got it. That's it. Pitch. Now, I've got Trim and Yaw. Trim is set - minus 73, plus 51. I have MTVC. Spacecraft Control to CMC. Trim is zero. Translational Hand Controller, clockwise; no MTVC [garble] number 2, Pitch - mark. I've got it. Yaw 2 - mark. I've got it. Trim is satisfactory. MTVC is satisfactory...
Intrepid. We're coming up on a burn with Dick right now, about 4 minutes and 30 seconds away.
Okay. We'll go - we'll be off the air.
Roger.
...Neutral and no MTVC. Rotational Hand Controller, two, AC/DC, Direct, two, Main A, Main B; BMAG's, Rate 2. Trim; okay, it's trimmed. Att1/Rate 2, Entered. Gimbal drive test: plus 2, minus 2, zero; plus 2, minus 2, zero. In 4 seconds, I'll have Trim, I hope. Okay, that's Trim; 03:47 time; FDAI scale 5/5; Limit Cycle is Off; Rate is High; DET is 1 second fast.
Clipper, Houston. I remind you, we'd like to have all Thrusters Armed.
Delta-V Thrust A is Normal; Translational Hand Controller is Armed; Rotational Hand Controller is Armed; Helium Valves are Auto; stand by for average g.
You're looking good here, Dick.
Thank you.
DSKY Blanks. DSKY is hot and EMS is Normal. Ullage: I have Ullage. Proceed. Thrust, On [garble] 5 seconds. Looking good.
Shutdown.
A and B are Off; Pitch 2 is Off; Yaw 1 is Off; Pitch 1 is Off.
Dick, all gimbals Off.
These are the residuals, but I'm off in attitude right now.
Okay. Thank you, Clipper. No trim.
Okay. I'm off in attitude, but there's the trim anyway.
Okay. I'm going to go over and get those bus ties.
Roger.
How's it looking up here, [garble].
We're watching you, Dick. We'll give you an update.
There it is.
And Oxidizer is 32.9, Fuel is 32.7, the unbalance is increase 75.
Roger, Dick. We copy.
EMS is minus 8.4.
Roger. Copy. Would you give us P00, please, Dick?[Long pause.]
Intrepid, Houston.
Go ahead.
Intrepid, plane change burn was good, and we show that you're about 1.15 behind in the Flight Plan.
Okay. That's not too bad. We'll pick up [Pause.]
Clipper, Houston. Will you give us P00 and Accept for lift-off REFSMMAT?
Okay, you've got it.
Clipper, the computer is yours.
Thank you.
I'd better do one thing.
[Garble] sure will.
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Dick, the burn looked real good on PGNCS. We'll be tracking you going across here, and it all looks good for the lift-off. Have a map update for you, Rev 20, when you are ready to copy.
Okay.
Rev 20: 120:46:53; 121:11:53; 121:33:05.
Okay. I copied that.
Roger, Dick.
How do you want to handle this high gain antenna [garble] the way it's been acting today?
Stand by on that.
Yankee Clipper. Houston.
Go ahead. Houston.
Dick, we would like you to go to Reacq at the present time and recycle and then go back to Auto. For the sleep period, we will have you go to the Omnis.
Dick, let's go back to Auto.
Hello, Houston. How do you hear me now in High Gain.
Dick, we got you loud and clear.
Now, this thing is acting up though; watch it.
Roger. And in the Reacq Mode, you went off.
It won't hold it in Auto either. I got to stay in Manual.
Roger, Dick [Long pause.]
Say, Dick. That was a fantastic job you did on picking up the Surveyor and the LM. That was well done. Plus the burn change - the plane change on the burn. You have been doing a good job.
Thank you, sir.
Clipper. Omni Bravo. Clipper, Omni Bravo.
Clipper, Houston. Would you confirm you're on Omni Bravo?
No negative. I'm on High Gain right now. Would you like me to go to Omni Bravo?
That's affirmative, Dick. Go Omni Bravo, present time.
Houston, Yankee Clipper. I just got a Master Alarm on the caution and warning display.
Okay, Yankee Clipper. Roger. Copy Master Alarm.
Yankee Clipper, we see nothing down here. You're still looking good.
Houston, [garble].
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Did you call?
Intrepid, [garble].
Clipper, we copied that P52 torquing angle.
Okay. Thank you, [garble].
Yankee Clipper, 1 minute to LOS.
Hello, Houston; Clipper.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. Read you loud and clear.
[Garble] stand by [garble] the E-memory dump [garble].
Roger. Stand by on that Dick.
Yankee Clipper, Houston. We're ready for the E-Mod.
Here it comes.
[Garble] the onboard readouts [garble] I have for the Batteries; 36.1 volts, Battery C, pyro Bat A, pyro Bat B.
Roger, Intrepid. Copy 36.1 volts, and would you say which ones those apply to?
Say again, Ed.
Clipper you gave me a reading 36.1 volts. I didn't copy; for which batteries were you reading that out?
Okay. That's three of them on battery C, pyro Bat A, and pyro Bat B.
Roger. And we'll be up to you with an RCS update in a minute.
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Go ahead.
Dick, for the sleep period in order to get a little extra signal margin on the Omni's, we'd like first of all - you'll be turning your High Gain to Off; S-Band, Normal; Voice to Off; S-Band, Auxiliary; Tape to Off. If you have to call ground, do it on Downvoice Backup.
Clipper, did you copy?
Yankee Clipper, Houston.[Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston.[Long pause.]
Yankee Clipper, Houston.
Houston, Clipper. Go ahead.
Clipper, you have A-C rolls selected in the DAP. Would you verify that your A-C thrusters are also enabled?
[Garble] select [garble].
Dick, we also have a lift-off block data for Rev 20 through 24 when you're ready to copy and the RCS totals, if you're interested.
Yes, I sure am interested in the [garble] just a second, though.
Roger, Dick.
Okay. Go ahead.
Rev 20, T-8, 122:19:32; Rev 21, T-9, 124:17:54; 22, T-10 , 126:16:13; Rev 23, T-11, 128:14:34; Rev 24, T-12, 130:12:59. Your RCS totals at a GET of 121 plus 30 is 57.7 and Alfa through Delta are 60.7, 55.5, 58.8, 56.0.
Roger. Copy. Thank you very much. Is that it for the day?
You're welcome, Clipper. And say again the question.
I said, "Was that it for the day?"
Clipper, again you were broken; repeat the question.
Okay, I guess that's it for the night, huh?
Roger. That's it, Dick, except for one thing. Would you verify that your pyro Bat readings are 36.1 rather than 37.17.
They are 37 - 37.1.
Copy, 37.1. Thank you. We'll talk to you in the morning.
Okay.
