Apollo 7, Houston through Guam. Standing by.
Roger.
Walt, one addition to the Flight Plan is a fuel cell O2 purge at 249 plus 30.
Roger.
And I've got the morning news here.
Okay. We'll copy.
Okay. The papers and television this morning are loaded with pictures of the big wedding over in Greece. And Gladys brought much needed rain to North Carolina. It had been suffering from a drought. Maurice Chevalier, who is 80, made his final stage appearance in Paris yesterday. He's been in show business for 68 years. And over to some of the pro ball results: Green Bay and Detroit tied, Chicago whomped Philadelphia, San Francisco over New York, New Orleans heat Pittsburg, Dallas over Minnesota, Cleveland upset Baltimore, St. Louis slaughtered Washington, LA beat Atlanta, and the Oilers, you got.
So Mendell got heat.
That's in the papers today, too.
Okay. Apollo 7, Houston. About 30 seconds LOS Guam; Hawaii at 15.
Roger.
Apollo 7. Houston through Hawaii.
Roger.
Walt, on the primary evaporator, we would like to have you reservice it and leave it off.
Roger. Two minutes' worth?
Affirmative.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are ready to send you the NAV vector, state vector update. Would you go to ACCEPT?
And I have the NAV check for you when you are ready to copy it.
Ready to accept, Jack.
Okay. Coming up.
Go ahead with your NAV, Jack.
Okay. GET 246 plus 30 plus 0000 plus 2607 plus 15014 0947.
246 30 0000 plus 2607 plus 15014 0947.
Roger. That's correct.
And we'll be waiting a rev to give you the block data number 26.
Okay. Could you give us a map update?
Okay -
We would like to have the present orbit or the last one that you got.
Okay. Stand by here. NAV check is in, state vector is in, and the computer is yours.
Okay. The present orbit for a map update 239 plus 59 plus 37, longitude 127.9 degrees east.
Roger. Thank you, Jack.
We are GO on your NAV check.
Copy.
Apollo 7, Houston.
GO ahead, Jack.
Roger, Walt. We are copying a little bit high on the steam pressure; did you do a normal service on primary evaporator?
Negative, Jack, but I got more than 2 minutes of water in it.
About how many minutes did you put in?
That was a little over 3 minutes.
Okay. Copy.
Apollo 7, opposite Omni.
You are on A now.
Okay.
Any suggestions on the water boiler?
No, Walt; we are still looking at massaging that down here.
Walt, what we're doing is, we are going to do is, that we are comparing that primary evaporator now with previous couple of days data.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Jack.
Have you initiated a battery charge on B yet?
Just now pulling the battery relay circuit breaker.
Okay. Fine. We want to take a look at it before LOS Texas here.
It's about the same thing it started at the other day, I think, a little over 2 amps.
Okay.
Hey, Walt, we are about 1 minute LOS Texas; we pick up Ascension at 54 for a short pass.
Roger. You reading the battery charge burn?
Roger. Showing 2.3.
Roger. I'll make this a normal charge, down to.4 amps.
Affirmative.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Roger, Jack. We're just vacuuming up water in the bottom of the spacecraft - same situation we've had in the last - or so SPS burn.
Hey, Jack, do you have spacecraft.
Walt, we have a keyhole effect here at Ascension; you're about two-by. I can just barely make it out.
Roger. We understand.
Apollo 7, 1 minute LOS Ascension; we pick you up at Tananarive at 08.
Roger, Jack. Do you read now?
Do you read, Jack?
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Roger, loud and clear.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Roger, do you read?
Houston, do you read Apollo 7?
Apollo 7, Houston. We're about 2 minutes LOS Tananarive; we pick up the Mercury at 34.
Roger, do you read Apollo 7 now?
Houston, Apollo 7. Out.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7 here.
Okay. Wally, just one little bit of information I wanted to get from you. I want to see how that crack in the MET has progressed after this last burn.
Looks like we have the one I described on the left side above "Hundreds of hours.
Right. That's it.
It has already reached the bottom of the glass trellis and the top below the "h" in the word "hours" to the bottom of "tens of hours." That goes all the way through. There are two smaller cracks that have developed above "Hundreds of hours." The crack on the second side has not changed since we first observed it.
Okay. Something you might give some thought to on entry is saving some tape out before you restow everything and taping this glass up so that it probably doesn't come out when you splash down.
Very good.
Hey, Jack, this is Walt.
Go ahead.
Roger. About 45 minutes ago, I turned the O2 fans 1 back AUTO and ran the fans 2 for 3 minutes.
Okay. We copy that, Walt. And I have a -
Jack, we've been trying to play a single thruster for roll, and I am not sure yet what quad you want to use for that.
Okay. We want to save quad B, Baker and Charlie, so use Quads Alpha and Delta us much as you can.
Okay. Do you have, on the back of our schematics book, the plate on the thrusters?
I can get it for you. You want to know circuit configuration?
Right. We've got it on the back of our schematics book, and I tried that, and it doesn't work.
Okay.
It's the taped-in chart, that came, from the logistics training manual, Jack.
Okay.
Should be on the set you have there as a backup set.
Yes, I've got it here.
I'll have Walt call out what he told me.
Okay. It's probably in the front of yours.
Yes, I've got it.
Okay. We were trying to use the quad A roll, and the channel switches were in A. So we pulled circuit breaker for A and C roll 2 main A. The channel switches were in A.
Okay.
That should give us A1 and A2 only, right?
Right. You're not using it on minimum impulse, are you?
Yes. You have to use minimum impulse. That's B and D, isn't it?
No, when you're in minimum impulse, you're going to use quads Baker and Charlie.
B and C, yes. That's what we did.
Okay. Then when you pull AC roll to main A, you're going to knock out quads - the roll jets in quad Charlie.
Yes, but right now, you want us to use A and D; but whenever we're at minimum impulse, we use B and C, so it looks like we're SOL for this one.
Right. You'll have to go to ACCEL COMMAND if you want to get that configuration.
I think we will probably stay like this at MIN impulse.
Okay.
Yes, that's much cheaper, Jack.
Right.
We'll use an A and C roll.
Okay.
ACCEL is pretty nice, but if you bump it accidentally, you hose out quite a bit.
Okay. We would like you to use B and D roll. You have a little more margin on quad Baker than you do on quad Charlie if you're going to be in minimum impulse.
Since we finished the burn, we have used 19 pulses.
Okay.
I'm working on 50 pulses per pound.
Okay. And I have your block data number 26 when you're ready to copy it, Walt.
Go ahead. I'm ready to copy.
Okay. 153 dash 4 Alpha plus 254 minus 1610 243 plus 11 plus 05 3069, 154 dash 1 Charlie dash 4 Charlie plus 163 minus 1610 244 plus 47 plus 45 2700, 155 dash Alpha Charlie minus 236 minus 0100 245 plus 22 plus 22 6914, 156 dash Alpha Charlie minus 139 minus 0110 246 plus 55 plus 49 6280, 157 dash Alpha Charlie minus 040 minus 0170 248 plus 28 plus 57 5782, 158 dash Alpha Charlie plus 053 minus 0250 250 plus 02 plus 00 5113. End.
Okay, Jack. Readback follows, and before that, we have just a couple more revs to go on the block data after this. If you get a chance, why don't you pass it up, and we will get it out of the way? Also, we would like that block data through REV 165. Over.
Okay. Copy that.
Readback follows: 153 dash 4 Alpha plus 354 minus 1610 243 plus 11 plus 05 3069, 154 dash 4 Charlie plus 163 minus 1610 244 plus 47 plus 45 2700, 155 dash Alpha Charlie minus 236 minus 0100 245 plus 22 plus 22 6914, 156 dash Alpha Charlie minus 139 minus 0110 246 plus 55 plus 49 6280, 157 dash Alpha Charlie minus 40 minus 0170 248 plus 28 plus 57 5782, 158 dash Alpha Charlie plus 053 minus 0250 250 plus 02 plus 00 5113. Over.
Roger. That's got it. We are working on the remaining block data.
Okay. I...
We'd like one block, one rev past deorbit.
Copy. We are about 50 seconds LOS Guam; Hawaii at 52.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. Standing by.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Jack, I would like to give you an inventory of the film we have left, and I would like to have the people who are involved in the and the way they have them call up targets, too. I don't even know where we are going, and maybe we'll be able to get some pictures for them. We have 25 frames of 368 left and 364, and approximately 48 frames of Panatomic-X; this is black and white.
Okay. Wally, you faded in and out on that. I did copy that you got about 20 frames of Panatomic-X left, but I didn't copy the number of frames in S0368.
25 frames in 368.
25 frames in 368, and you would like - as I understand it - for us to give you some desired targets of opportunity to photograph. Is that correct?
Roger, It's only information.
Okay, we will see if we can come up with some desired targets as you come around on the subsequent rev.
We have got the film count at 15 frames 368, 48 frames Pan-X.
Copy that.
Apollo 7, opposite Omni.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Say again, 7.
Roger. I think we can turn the power down to about half the SPS.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are. about 1 minute LOS Guaymas, we pick up Tananarive at 44.
Roger.
CDR, 10 clicks of water; LMP, 15 clicks of water.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive, standing by.
Okay, Jack.
Okay. Reading about 3 by, Walt.
We're always...
surprised that you could hear us at all here.
Roger. Coming up over Guam, I'll pass you some of that information on terrain photographic targets.
Roger. We are chlorinating now.
Okay. Copy that.
It took a long time.
7, we are about 1 minute LOS Tananarive; we pick up the Mercury at 08.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through the Mercury.
Yes, Jack.
Okay. I have some of that information on photography here.
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. At GET of 243:55, when you approach the west coast of South America, you can shoot the 368 - S0368 water to land; at 244:01 on the east coast of South America, you can shoot the S0368 land to water. And do you feel like you want to finish it up this pass, Wally, or do you want to continue on to the next rev?
We'll go on this rev.
Okay. I'll try to give you some times on the - well, in the next rev, you'll hit the west coast of South America about 245:32 and the east coast about 245:37. And if it's hazy, don't shoot the 368 film, and we'll give you more targets later on.
We hear you.
Okay. On the Pan-X, they are requesting on this rev here - on that 245:32 - a strip exposure, one exposure every 10 seconds from 245:32 until 245:37, all the way across South America to the water. And use the red filter on the Pan-X film.
Is that for weather photography?
Okay. It's a strip photography of the land; it's not really weather.
You want red only and not red and green. Is that right?
No, red only.
Okay.
Jack, you still listening?
Go ahead.
I've got the S0368 at 243:55; I think you said something about 244:01.
Okay. You'll hit the west coast of South America at 243:55, and you could take some pictures there, water to land. And then at 244:01 - that's what time you'll hit the east coast of South America and could take some S0368 land to water. Did I confuse you?
Opposite Omni, 7.
Apollo 7, we are 1 minute LOS Guam; we pick up Hawaii at 27.
Affirmative.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
How's it going?
Roger. Loud and clear.
Okay. Go ahead.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Huntsville; Tananarive at 244 plus 20.
Roger. Read you. Huntsville is flying. Bring Deke up again.
They were down below, Wally, and they are on their way back now.
Okay.
They were...
Okay. Walt, we copy a battery charging current of 0.41 so you can turn the battery charger off now at any time.
Say again, Jack.
See you at Tananarive.
Roger.
I'll come up at Tananarive.
Wally, you can turn the battery charger off on batt B.
What's that?
Okay.
Huntsville LOS. Apollo 7 did not copy your last transmission.
pulses.
Landmark 153 on magazine N, that's frames 42 and 43. The first one is of the coastline right about Antofagasta, just slightly north of Antofagasta, and the second picture was roughly in the same spot.
Magazine N, frames 44 and 45 were of the east coast of South America.
Frames 40 through 45, magazine N, on the east coast of South America in the vicinity of landmarks 153 and 155.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Roger, how do you read?
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Loud and clear.
Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read?
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger. You are loud and clear also.
Roger, you can correct that word in the Flight Plan from "landing" to "splash.
Wally, for a point of information, we are assuming that stowage will be nominal for retrofire. If you have any items that are stowed non-nominally, would you let us know for c.g. purposes? We would like to calculate c.g. rather closely.
Understand.
We'll have the gloves and the suit stowage bag would also be.
Okay. COMM is not the best here. You can give us a report over the Mercury on that subject. We will hit the Mercury at 44.
Roger.
Man!
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Tananarive.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. Standing by.
Roger. Stand by. We're working on our pictures.
Roger.
Good morning, Ron.
Good morning, Donn.
The redundant component cheek is complete, except for the main regs. I may get those over Hawaii; we're waiting for sunrise here.
Roger.
Ron, I'm assuming you are recording down there. We're watching the sunrise come up. We're going to film it with ASA 1,000 film. At first, we saw some kind of a lightish gray with hardly any color, and then a very light blue, which turned into a little darker, like maybe a magenta. That blue at 1.8 degrees, we're starting to get the orange now, and it's just about light enough out there, where we can catch the clouds on the far horizon, maybe a hundred miles away being in profile. And I'm going to have to let go here in a second and start running the camera.
Roger. We have it recorded.
After the blue layers which had various layers within itself, with the light and dark alternating, we got our layer of yellow which is almost white, and then went on into an orange. At first, it's a fairly dull orange, and then it's getting very bright.
Roger.
Ron, we ran out of film just as the sun broke the horizon.
Yes, yes.
This is really working out, Ron. I'm running a light meter and holding the spacecraft.
Roger.
We went all the way from one-fiftieth of a second at two, moving on up while the sun was rising till we had a P22 and 1250, and I hope it turns out.
Roger.
We have so far 160 pulses which I estimated about 3 pounds.
Roger. LOS.
That was magazine C of S0168. The first few feet on it is part of a suiting exercise we took in the spacecraft a little earlier. And the last, from 40 on down on the meter reading, at least, was sunrise, which was completed at 244:51:30 this morning.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Loud and clear.
Roger. The same.
Ron, do we have the O2 manifold pressure?
Roger. 103.
Roger. Switching.
104 now.
The redundant component check is GO.
Roger.
I guess you heard we changed the word "landing" to "crash".
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS, Redstone at 19, and we still show secondary coolant loop in operation.
Just the pump.
Concur.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. Standing by.
Roger. Ron.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS; Ascension at 33.
At 245 hours, 36 minutes into the flight, we finished stripping the southern parts of South America across Chile and Argentina filling the bill. And I don't know which frame we started with on magazine U, but we ended up with mag - frame 33 on the eastern coast of South America.
Frame 48 and 49 - I am not sure if I taped that last on TRANSMIT or on the INTERCOM position, but at any rate, I am going to say that we stripped the southern part of South America, starting with some frame on magazine U, ending up with maga - with frame 33 on magazine U, on the eastern coast of South America.
Frames 48 and 49 of magazine N we're taking with S0368, but with a red filter still left on from the previous exercise, so they will not be very good - like no good.
Simultaneously, coming across the - at the same strip, we skip-mapped, using 16mm camera with S0368 film at one frame per second from the west coast of South America, across the Andes, and out on the east coast of South America.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. Standing by.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Houston, Apollo 7.
This is Apollo 7.
Houston. Go.
Roger. We shut down the SCS at 38 minutes after the hour, and there were 200 pulses out of the fuel.
Apollo 7. Houston. Say that again.
Roger. We shut down at 245 hours, 38 minutes on SCS.
Roger.
And we used 200 pulses of...
fuel.
Roger. Copy.
That's about 4 pounds as we figure it, and not nearly as bad as the 45 we blew yesterday on a crazy experiment.
Roger. Copy that.
7, Houston. Your surge of power was observed that time.
Roger. That's what you get when you're driving an Austin Healey.
(Laughter).
7, Houston. Opposite Omni.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS; Mercury at 20.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. Standing by.
Loud and clear.
Roger. The same.
Hey, Ron, I've got two questions I'd like to have answers for, when you can get it.
Roger. Go.
One has to do with the fuel cells. We're presently planning to power up tomorrow morning somewhere in the 254th hour; that's so Donn can get some alignments out of the way before we get up. And fuel cell 2 has been going to worms a little faster each day. When I get up, it looks like it's climbing at a fairly healthy rate; I'd like to open circuit fuel cell 2 and put it back on the line at about T minus 45 minutes or T minus 30 minutes. That's the first point. The other one is on the primary evaporator. I overserviced that today, and I guess we don't know exactly how much water I got in it. It was on for more than 3 minutes though. And I wanted to know are we planning on bringing the primary evaporator back on the line or not, and I suspect we probably just as well not do it, and I'd like to just go ahead and change secondary coolant loop with radiator bypass and put the suit circuit on the secondary coolant loop. Over.
Roger. Say the last on your primary evaporator, after are we planning to use it, everything after that.
Okay. The details are down there already on - I overserviced the evaporator. I guess what I'd prefer to do instead of risking any possible problems with the steam duct, I would like to just go ahead and activate secondary coolant loop with the radiator bypass and put the suit circuit secondary coolant loop and run a primary loop just on radiators.
Roger. Copy your comments; will advise.
Okay.
I checked all the command module RCS engine temps about an hour ago. They're already at high loads; we don't plan on heating the command module RCS engines.
Roger. We concur on RCS engine heaters; that is, it's not necessary to heat.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite Omni.
Hey, Ron, if you're still there, can you give me my present battery status? We did a charge battery 2 today, battery B.
Roger. We're working on it now; we'll get it up to you, probably over Redstone.
Roger. Thanks.
CDR.
CDR, 246 hours, 44 minutes.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. Standing by.
Roger, Ron.
We're checking all angles which you called down. No answers yet.
Roger. Thank you. I knew you guys would your best.
Say again, Walt.
Roger. I knew you guys would do your best.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite Omni.
Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS; Ascension at 18.
Roger, Ron.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. Standing by.
Roger. Loud and clear.
And - 7, Houston - I have your battery status if you desire.
Go ahead.
Roger. Batt A 26.26, batt B 26.31, batt Charlie 39.5.
You mean after we did that charge this afternoon on batt B, it's still got only 26 hours?
That's affirmative.
Okay. Thank you.
You might say we're hard chargers.
Roger.
Say, Ron, would you give me 35 clicks on the water pistol over the last 4 hours?
Wilco.
7, Houston. The Chronicle refers to the "Majestic Apollo 7 flying machine." And they say Apollo is winding up the loose ends.
Winding up what?
The loose ends.
Winding up what, again?
Roger. The headlines say the Apollo is winding up the loose ends. E-N-D-S.
We think it's a magnificent flying machine, too, Ron.
Roger.
What's the loose ends for? I think we're kinda taut.
(Laughter) Concur.
We just found out today we're not in a landing craft.
No comment.
It looks like the wives' pictures made the paper tonight, too. They were out at the Astrodome watching the Oilers' game last night.
Yes. I guess they would. Jo's a complete fan of that outfit.
Yes.
About 30 seconds to LOS; Mercury at 56.
Roger, Ron. We'll be just about fading out and let Donn carry on the happy evening.
Roger.
We've had a pretty good day.
We concur. I'll see you down at the Cape.
Roger. Ron, thanks a lot.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. Standing by.
Roger, Ron. Loud and clear. How me?
Roger. Loud and clear.
Good show on that team. Like to speak to Flight, if I may.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston Flight. How do you read?
Flight, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston Flight. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Gene.
Roger. How're you doing, Wally?
Very good. I want to thank you and your team for an outstanding job; it was a very professional show and one we've really enjoyed.
Okay. Thank you very much, Wally.
Walt, would you like to say a word?
Say, Gene, thanks a million. It wouldn't have been such a great flight without the great support we had down there. We have a magnificent flying machine up here, but we wouldn't have been going this long without you guys.
Okay. We'll be seeing you.
This is Donn. That goes for me, too, Gene.
Okay, Donn.
Very big help.
Roger. See you later now, Donn.
Staying right in there with us.
Roger.
We'll see you cats back in the big 'H' aha dry some more beer up.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite Omni.
Houston, Apollo.
Houston. Go.
Roger. Log six clicks on the water gun for Walt, please.
Wilco.
And make it ten for Wally.
Roger.
And you better make it about 20 for me over the last 3 hours.
Will do.
Ron, incidentally, I haven't been keeping a very good check on that water consumption for the last couple days; so if the doctor's concerned about it, tell him not to worry about it. I've been drinking plenty, I just haven't got it all logged in.
Roger. I understand.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Loud and clear. Standing by.
Say, Ron, we've still got a little film up here I'd like to use, and I was wondering if you guys would give me 3 or 4 pounds of fuel so I could go ahead and use it up during the next two or three revs, 3 or 4 pounds of RCS fuel, that is.
Roger. Stand by. Little garbled there, I understand you want 3 or k pounds of RCS fuel to use.
Yes, see how we stand on RCS fuel. I'll get the fuel reading anyhow.
7, Houston. Opposite Omni.
Roger.
7, Houston. How's the voice now?
Say again.
Roger. Loud and clear now, Donn. If you can repeat what you were saying -
Oh. Roger. I was asking for an RCS fuel quantity reading for our chart, and also asked - negotiating for a few pounds of attitude fuel so I can finish off our camera film.
Roger. I understand. Stand by on both counts.
While you're at it, maybe you can dream up some - or whip up some targeting for pictures.
Donn, we'll see you at Mercury next rev, and we'll have the answers available for both at that time.
Roger. Say it again, Walt - Ron.
Roger. We'll give you the answers to both questions at Mercury on the next rev there.
Okay.
But it looks favorable at this time.
Okay.
Oh, Ron, I'll give you a film inventory. We have a few frames of Hasselblad color film 368 and a couple of magazines of 16 mm for the Maurer camera.
Roger.
I'd like to shoot those out the window at either targets of opportunity or any particular targets that you might be able to give me, that is, you know, at a time when we're going over a particular item of interest.
Roger.
And we also have some Panatomic-X left.
Check.
I think we've got about 25 frames of Pan-X and, oh, I don't know, six or eight of 368, and I'd say two rolls of camera - of movie film.
Roger.
Oh, and while you're at it, could you get me a map update also?
Wilco.
7, Houston. I have your map update.
Roger.
REV 156 at 247 plus 30 plus 38, longitude 12.5 east.
Roger. Would you say it again? My earpiece came out while you were talking.
Roger. REV 256, GET 247 plus 30 plus 38, longitude 12.5 east.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. The United States has a total of 55 Olympic medals, and 22 of these are gold.
Pretty good.
Roger.
7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS; Ascension at 53.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. Standing by.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. I have your RCS quantities if you want.
Okay, Ron. Go ahead.
Roger. At 248 hours, you have a total for your profile of 503 pounds, and I have your redlines I if you desire those.
Okay. Go ahead with all of them then.
Roger. SCS redline 533, DAP redline 458, and your hybrid 234.
Okay. 503 remaining, 533 SCS, 458 DAP, 234 hybrid.
Affirmative.
And - 7, Houston - I have block data 27 whenever you want it.
Okay. I can take it right now.

7, Houston. You read back correct. We'll have them for the next ten revs later.
Okay. Oh, I hope not!
7, Houston. We're wondering about the decongestant that you're taking here about this time.
Oh. Roger. I forgot to log that in. Both Walt and Wally each had an Actifed about 248:30, and I took one at 249.
Roger.
7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS; Mercury at 32. And do you show an O2 purge at 30?
Roger. I do.
Roger. Thank you.
Time, 249 hours, 27 minutes and 58 seconds; frame 55, magazine M.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. Standing by.
Roger. Apollo 7 here.
Roger, Donn.
Fuel cell purge is complete, Ron.
Roger. And I've got a couple of updates for your S0368 in the Pan-X.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. At 251 plus 15, we have some cloud formations over New Guinea, and they're on track. Be good for S0368 film.
Okay. Will do. Can we use some fuel on them?
Opposite Omni then. Say again.
Roger. What do you say about using a little RCS fuel to turn these ends so we can get some pictures?
Roger. We're checking on it now. And I have a - at 252 plus 39, we have an S-V target number 34. It will be north of track; use Pan-X with red filter.
Okay. At 39, you've got S-V from a turn north of track; Pan-X with red filter.
Roger. And you have a GO on your SCS. Recommend BD roll channel DISABLED and...
Okay.
Minimum impulse.
Roger.
7, Houston. We'd like to power up the CMC over Redstone and watch the time again.
Okay. Will do.
Roger.
7, Houston. I have another Pan-X update.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. And this is really the number 1 priority - at that 251 plus 00, see Ganges River in India south of track, use Pan-X with red filter.
Okay.
7, Houston. For your information, Quad B has 4 pounds margin from the batt redline, and Quad Delta has 7 pounds.
I see. So just don't use TB.
If possible.
Roger. Got you.
7, Houston.
Go, Ron.
Roger. I just got word that the - we're going to need a little more time to check that surge of power on the Saturn.
Okay.
Okay.
Yes. Roger. I copy.
About 30 seconds LOS; Redstone at 03.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. Standing by.
Roger.
Roger.
Ron, I've got a note in the Flight Plan that says, "Battery charge as required." Has that already been taken care of?
Scratch it out.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite Omni.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Everything's up to snuff on the computer. You can go ahead and power down.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS; Ascension at 32.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. Standing by.
Roger. This is Apollo 7.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. When you get a chance, request onboard readout pyro A and B and batt C. No hurry.
Okay. How much time to LOS?
I missed that. Say again.
How much time to LOS?
Roger. About three and a half minutes.
Pyro A is 36.9, and pyro B is 36.8.
Roger. Copy.
Thirty seconds LOS; Redstone at 38.
Time is 251 hours, 1 minute; frames 51 and 52, magazine N.
Corrections on that last frame number. Those were 56 and 57 on magazine N at 251 hours and 1 minute.
251 hours, 20 minutes; frames 57 and 58, magazine N, New Guinea.
And in addition to the Hasselblad frame, we also had almost continuous strip coverage at one or six frames per second.
It started up in the area of the Ganges in India, all across Burma, the China coast, the Philippines, and New Guinea, and on out into the Pacific beyond New Guinea.
The time was roughly from 251 hours to 251:25.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. Standing by.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Loud and clear, Donn.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Go.
Roger. We understand you have a cabin soaked with cold, and we don't feel the cabin cold soak is necessary this time.
Roger. I've got a CABIN TEMP of about 65 degrees and SUIT TEMP of about 51. It's very comfortable in here right now.
Roger.
Speaking of cold soak and related things, we were discussing putting the secondary water boiler ON for entry and leaving the primary OFF. Has there been any discussion of that down there?
Lots of it.
Yes, I bet.
We're still discussing, Donn.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite Omni.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS.
Roger, Houston.
Antigua at 59.
Roger. Fifty nine for Antigua.
Apollo 7, Houston through Antigua. A one-line Flight Plan update.
Roger.
Go ahead, Ron.
Roger. At 258 plus 30, oxygen fuel cell purge.
Roger. I understand. An O2 fuel cell purge at 258 plus 30.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Canary.
Roger. Good morning, Bill.
Good morning and a pleasant last day to you.
Yeah, boy.
Apollo 7, Houston. A little over half minute LOS Canary. S-band volume up and a 45 second for about two minutes until we get to Madrid.
Apollo 7. Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up on LOS. S-band volume up at 55 for Honeysuckle; Redstone at 13.

Apo11o 7, Houston. Are you trying to call?
Negative, Bill.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute to LOS Redstone; Antigua at 32.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. Standing by.
Roger, Bill.
That is Antigua.
Bill, at what station pass do you expect the update for the retro maneuver?
Stand by, Donn.
Hey, Donn, it will be over Antigua the next pass; be about one hour and a half.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Antigua; Canary at 44.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. AOS Canary.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite Omni, please.
Roger.
Roger. Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Canary. S-band up at 53, and we'll have Carnarvon at 21.
Roger. Say again, Bill.
Roger. S-band volume up in about 1 minute for the Madrid pass, and if no contact, we'll have Carnarvon at 21.
Oh, okay. Understand.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7 here.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Bill, I'm just going to brief you for something to do up here. Wally and Walt are still asleep. I've got some of the spacecraft stowed - that that I could get at without disturbing them - and I'm going to be putting my suit on here pretty shortly. At the beginning of the next night pass, I'm going to try to get P51 accomplished so I can get a leg up on the whole time line. That way, when your update comes up later in the pass, if there's time, I'd like to get P52 done, or I might wait until the next one.
Okay. Right. We'll - we have the REFSMMAT, NAV load, and the target load ready for the Antigua pass, and that will be at 08 past the hour.
Okay. Zero eight?
Right.
Roger.
So that will be ready and waiting if you - oh, that'll give you - let's see, that won't give you too much of that night pass actually.
I'd like to do the P51 before that, you see.
Okay. If you could - if we could get through with that before 08, then we could get those three loads up to you and have that done and away with.
Yes, that's a good idea, Bill. Okay. Fine.
Okay. Thank you.
I think we can get it all done but maybe the fine aliment before they get up.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Carnarvon; Honeysuckle in about 1 minute; turn your volume up.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston through Honeysuckle. Standing by.
Roger. Read you.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Go, Bill.
Right. Donn, I have a little discussion here on a couple of items. I would like to make a couple of recommendations. First, for entry, we would like all three fuel cells on line. And secondly, we would like to operate the coolant loops primary without the evaporator secondary loop in bypass with the evaporator on.
Roger. Understand. You want the fuel cells on, all three formed for entry?
Affirmative.
And on the coolant, you want to run the primary system with the evaporator shut down? And on the secondary, bypassing the radiators with the secondary water boiler on it?
That's affirmative; and, of course, if the secondary evaporator quits, well, you can switch to primary evaporator and try it.
Roger. Understand.
Okay.
Thank you.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite Omni, please.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite Omni.
Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read?
Fine, Bill.
Okay. One final item. This secondary radiator - we'd like to activate that at 258 Hours.
You're going to do what?
I'm sorry - secondary evaporator at 258.
Oh, okay. Secondary evaporator at 258 hours. Understand.
Roger.
I got it in my log here.
Thank you. And we're coming up on 1 minute LOS Honeysuckle; we'll have Redstone at 50.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. Standing by.
Apollo 7, Houston. No need to acknowledge. When you get around to it, opposite Omni, please.
Apollo 7, Houston. No need to acknowledge. One minute to LOS Redstone; MILA at 06; Antigua at 08.
Okay, Bill.
Getting gyro-torquing angles, 00001, 00362, 00612. This is preliminary P52 for deorbit. We do not deorbit at this time, however. Time is 255 hours, 4 minutes.
Apollo 7, Houston through MILA. Standing by.
Roger, Bill.
Bill, you ready with the updates?
Say again, Donn.
Are you ready with the updates?
Roger. We're ready if you're in ACCEPT.
You've got it.
Thank you.
Donn, We're in a keyhole right now; it will be coming up in a couple of minutes.
Okay. I 'm standing by for the maneuver PAD whenever you have it.
Roger. Okay. I'll give it to you as soon as I get it.
Oh, you don't have it yet. I see, no sweat.
Apollo 7, Houston. I have maneuver PAD when you're ready to copy.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. 164 dash I Alpha; retrofire 259 39 1594 minus 02071 minus 00000 plus 02822 2350 minus 0260 03305 24010 minus 071 minus 134 012 30 3058 314 259 00 0000 minus 2447 plus 06813 1561 180 180 000. Comments: sextant star not visible after 259 plus 21. Another comment: backup align stars are north set. I do have boresight star information.
Roger. Let's skip the boresight information for now. Readback as follows: 164 dash 1 Alpha; 259 39 1594 minus 02071 minus all balls plus 02822 2 0 minus 0260 03305 24010 minus 071 minus 134 012 30 58 314 259 00 0000 minus 2447 plus 06813 1561 180 180 and 0.
Roger. Check on a couple of them on NOUN 42 apogee 2350, and in NOUN 48 Y-trim 134.
Roger. That's what I got.
Readback is correct.
You've got a very loud squeal in your transmitter there.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Go, Bill.
Right, Donn. We could get the SCS line heaters to A/B.
Okay. You want the line heaters ON, right?
Right.
Roger. You get all the way down to 60 degrees.
Apollo 7, we have the REFSMMAT, NAV, and targets in; the computer is yours. One minute LOS Antigua; we'll have Canaries at 20.
Roger, Bill, Understand. I've get the computer back here. You're garbled, and you've got a very loud squeal there.
Okay. I'm checking on it.
Your station or your transmitter is real bad.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Would you go to BLOCK, please?
Apollo 7, Houston through Canary.
Apollo 7, Houston. If you read, go to BLOCK.
Apollo 7, Houston. Two and one half minutes LOS Canary; we'd like BLOCK on the uplink when you can get around to it, please.
Apollo 7, Houston. Did you call?
Negative, Bill. I was just trying on my helmet to see if it fits.
Okay. Would you go to BLOCK, please?
Roger.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 7. How do you read?
I read you five-square.
Okay. Fine. I just had my other COMM helmet on, and I just wanted to check it out.
Roger. About I minute to LOS Canaries; we'll have Carnarvon at 55 and confirm going to BLOCK now.
Roger. We're in BLOCK now.
Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
Houston, Apollo 7. Did you call?
Roger. Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
Roger. We're up and at 'em here. I've got my lumpy suit on, and Walt and Wally are crashing around in the LEB getting something to eat.
Roger. Understand. And, Donn, in behalf of the gold team here in Mission Control, we wish to extend our congratulations to the crew and wish you every good wish for a nice soft landing, and we'll see you tomorrow.
Well, thank you, pardner. Thanks a lot for helping us out. Who's your flight director there?
Jerry Griffin.
Is Jerry there?
Jerry, air ground 2.
Yes, I'm here.
Hey, how you doing, buddy?
Fine.
Good. Sure appreciate all the fine help you gave us up here.
Well, thank you, and we're looking forward to seeing you when you get back to the ranch.
Yes, I'll say. We'll have to - right, Walt and Wally send their regards, Jerry, to you and all the other fellows down there. They're not suited up yet and don't have their COMM on, so I'll just pass it along.
Okay. Thanks much, Donn.
See you later.
Roger.
You going off duty, Bill?
Roger. I'm staying here, though. Jack will be talking with you now.
I see. Okay.
I'll be watching you from here.
Good morning, Donald.
Yes, I guess you would at that, wouldn't you?
Good morning, Donn.
Hi, Jack.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger, Jack.
Donn, just so it doesn't startle you, you're getting close to a master alarm on fuel cell 2. It's the TCE.
Okay. We were just talking about that up here. Walt's of the opinion that we ought to take that mother offline when it goes over limit and save it until later. What do you guys think?
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go.
Okay, Donn. On fuel cell 2, there's been a lot of discussion on that down here, and they feel that with the trends that they've seen that the TCE should top out about 185, and they would just as soon leave it on the line to keep from any switching transients there. And you shouldn't reach any higher than 185 at retrofire.
Okay. We're reading 181 right now.
Okay. That's about - you're about 4 degrees higher than the actual there. Our value down here now is 177.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're about 1 minute to Carnarvon. Do you want to turn S-band volume up? We'll pick up Honeysuckle for a long pass there.
Okay.
Apollo 7. Houston. One minute LOS Honeysuckle; we'll pick Guaymas at 36.
Hello. How do you read?
gyro-torquing angles, minus 1.84, plus 858, minus 2.171. P52 alignment over.
torquing angles.
P52 plus 0004.
Apollo 7, Houston through Texas. Standing by.
Roger. Jack, how do you read our COMM here?
I read you five-by, Walt.
How's it going this morning?
It's going very well. How's things with you?
Fine.
Are you there, and are you familiar with the fuel cell performance on yesterday's burn?
Roger, Walt. I am.
Okay. I guess if it goes on up to 200 and we're in a retro countdown, I'm not going to sweat it anyway. I'm going to let it run on. I guess - it seems to me if we went ahead and opencircuited here for the next hour and a half, we'd - maybe next 2 hours, a little longer, put it on around minus 30 or minus 45 minutes, we'd have little or no problem with it.
Roger. I don't think from what we have been talking about that you'll have to worry. That is, we'll get up over 200; and if it does, we have been given the GO to let it go ahead and go over 200.
Roger. That's my intention.
Okay. We concur.
It's a shame we can't get that one back and take a look at it.
I agree.
From all the data, we'll have a pretty good idea of what it is.
Very good.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Jack, go ahead.
Okay. Walt, at 258 here, when you activate the secondary loop, we'd like you to configure the suit heat exchanger for BYPASS on the primary loop and for FLOW on the secondary loop.
Already set up.
You're way ahead of me.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're 1 minute LOS Bermuda; we pick up the Canaries in about 3 minutes.
Roger, Jack.
Hey, Jack, give me 20 clicks on the water now.
Okay, Walt.
Apollo 7, Houston through the Canaries.
Roger. Jack, on the command module RCS temps, we are still reading 5 volts on all of them.
Okay. Real fine, Walt.
I'd like to bring you up to date on a canister change. We did that canister change 21 let me find it here. It was...
Okay. Walt, you get cut out there; copied canister change 21.
Yes, I looked for it; we put it off until we had 3 mm or something like that on the CO2 partial pressure. Anyhow, it is written down on the DTO book, which I can't quite get at now. Hang on a second.
Hey, Jack, at 245 hours and 56 minutes, we did our last - put our last fresh canister in. And it in the next hour or so, we are going to recycle number 1 back in.
Okay. Fine. Could you bring me up to date on -
We sure had a square unfilled there.
Okay. You're right.
Jack, we're actually two canisters short on this flight.
Roger, Walt.
It seems impossible, doesn't it?
It kind of does. Could you bring me up to date on the - how you're coming on stowage?
Roger. Stowage is all but complete. We took the three biobelts and stowed them in the fecal canister where we have been taking out the fresh fecal bag. And we're going to be getting unsuited on the water as soon as we get a chance on there, assuming we all come out of this in a nice smooth shape. And we have two temporary stowage bags up with the coveralls in the temporary stowage bags.
Okay.
Everything else is stowed in its nominal place.
Okay. You got the gloves stowed and helmets on?
The helmets we don't have on. We're going to try the helmets. It's our general feeling now that we probably will not be wearing those helmets. We're going to make one more stab when we get the couch down to the launch position and see what we can do about clearing our ears. I'm probably in better shape than the other guys, and I'm not too sure about my ears. By the way Wally and Donn talked, they are in a little bit worse shape than I am. And if they go with their helmets off, that's the way I'll go, too. We don't want to get the suit loop too confused, as to which way it is supposed to act.
Okay.
There are a few items still left to be stowed and put in shape. That's like the data file, the temporary stowage items, the F - Is there an F item, Donn? F1 and F2 still have a couple of small items then that we are going to have put back in the right place when Wally gets the couch. And he is about suited, and he will be on COMM shortly.
Okay, Walt. How about the oxygen mask? Are they put away?
They are all stowed.
Okay.
Helmets are - if we do not wear the helmets, the helmets will be tied down at the foot of the couch in front of each guy's couch. They will be below the level of the canisters down there. So it's out of the couch envelope.
Okay. We're not concerned about hurting the helmets. We're concerned about your heads.
Roger. We understand, Deke, and we're trying to make a go of it all the way with the helmets. We haven't gotten to the position where we can try them on in the couch in the boost position yet. However, we do feel that we have - if we go with the helmets off, we'll have pretty damned good protection set up around us.
7, we're about 1 minute LOS Canaries; we'll pick up Tananarive about 19.
Right. Good morning, Jack.
Good morning, Jack. Houston, Apollo 7.
Houston, your -
Go ahead. Donn.
This is Wally, just saying good morning.
You've taken the last Actifed at 257 here.
Talking about Actifed, we all took it.
Okay. Real fine.
We've still got our nausea pills left to take.
Okay. The carrier reports wave height 1 foot out there.
That sounds almost good enough for the Air Force.
We thought a little bit of chop might break the landing just a little bit.
You can tell the carrier to watch out; we'll be coming down his stack.
What's the carrier call?
Carrier call is Essex.
That's the name - is that the call, too?
How could you O2?
I'll be giving you a rundown on weather and call signs as we go a little bit further here.
Jack, do you read CDR?
Roger. Five-by, Wally. We're just about to lose you.
Houston through Tananarive.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Houston, do you read?
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Tananarive; we'll he coming to you at Carnarvon at 30 with an entry update.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
Ready to copy entry update.
Okay. First, Walt, we'd like you to turn your H2 heaters and fans on for both tanks to the ON position for a few minutes bore so we can bump up the H2 pressure.
Going now.
Okay. Then I'll give you the entry update.
Ready to copy.
Okay one -
Do you want fans and heaters ON?
Fans and heaters ON.
For hydrogen?
Hydrogen, right.
Fuel cell is still climbing, 184 on my gage.
Yes, we're considering open circuit. We want to get a few data - a little bit of data flow here before we make any decision.
We'll take 10-degree flaps, too.
Roger. Okay. You ready on the entry update, Walt?
Read it.
Okay. 164 dash 1 Alpha 190 000 042 000 10635 25954 16 plus 20 plus 2763 minus 06417 16 plus 49 minus 02846 55 slash 55 19 plus 22 17 plus 02 19 plus 58 24 plus 12 043 minus 18 slash plus 40.
Roger. Jack, readback follows: 164 dash 1 Able 190 000 042 000 10635 25954 16 20 plus 2763 minus 06417 16 49 minus 02846 55 55 19 22 17 02 19 58 24 12 043 minus 18 slash plus 4 zero. And I have a question on your maneuver update remarks.
Okay. Stand by. Go ahead.
Roger. Down at the remarks is SCS 259, and I've got written in here 21 on the PAD. Shouldn't that probably be 41 if this is for SCS burn backup?
That was for the sextant star not visible after 259 plus 21 plus 00?
Okay. Sextant star 259 plus 21. Thank you.
Okay.
And the entry update readback was correct?
Perfect.
Got to do something right.
Okay. Walt, We're recommending Omni A for the burn and Omni C for post SEP.
Understand. Wilco.
And you'll be Simplex A for reentry, and -
That's affirmed.
And cabin fans, that's a crew option. You can have no fans, one fan, or two fans. Your choice.
We'll have no fans; however, I am a little bit I interested in bringing on the secondary loops a little sooner. The suit is a little bit warm.
Okay. Stand by.
Hey, Jack, on the maneuver PAD, the velocity counter setting is different from the - what showed up on the DSKY with the Delta-V by 19.5 feet per second, I think, and you have Delta-V tailoff at 19.
Okay. Stand by, Walt. We'll get a reading on that.
Okay. Walt, on your last question on the Delta-V counter: that 19 feet a second is our value for the adjusted tailoff and what you should be reading in the Delta-V counter after the burn is over.
I understand that, Jack, but the Delta-VC that you set on is generally different from the G&N reading by that tailoff amount.
Right. Okay. I guess I missed it, Walt. Why don't you go over it again? I guess I missed your question.
Okay. In doing P30, in one of the displays, it shows Delta-V, and we set the Delta-V counter to be equal to Delta-V minus the Delta-V at tailoff. In this case, from your maneuver PAD, they were different by 19.5 feet per second, which would indicate that there was 19.5 feet per second tailoff. I commented on it at the time because it seemed kind of large and now the Delta-V at tailoff on the entry PAD is 19.
Okay, Walt.
It's small point, but I'd like to know which is which in case I have to update my entry chart.
Okay. We'll discuss that. We're about 1 minute LOS Carnarvon. You want to turn up S-band so we can get Honeysuckle?
Okay.
Okay. Walt, on that question there, what has happened is the Delta-V tailoff coming out of the CMC could be off by as much as 1 foot per second because we didn't update it yesterday. We chose not to do it because we felt it was accurate enough.
Okay. Then I will update my entry chart based on how it differs from 19 feet per second. Is that correct?
That is correct.
Understand.
Apollo 7. Opposite Omni.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Chuck.
Okay. Wally, we'd like to have you turn the H2 fans and heaters off now.
That's done; OFF not AUTO.
Roger, OFF, O-F-F. And, Walt, we'd like to have you open circuit fuel cell 2; our plans are to probably bring it back on line over the States.
Understand. Welcome to the club.
Okay. We'd like to have you purge all fuel cells. First, make an O2 purge on all fuel cells before the secondary loop activation.
Okay. I'll go ahead and purge them now so that I can purge 2 before I take it off.
Okay. We concur.
Roger.
And, Walt, on your question on the secondary loop activation: you can bring that loop online any time after you've done the O2 purge of the fuel cells.
Apollo 7, we're about 1 minute LOS Honeysuckle; we pick up the Huntsville at 04.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through the Huntsville. Standing by.
Roger. Loud and clear.
You're about three-by, Wally.
Roger.
Huntsville, Apollo 7. You should be able to get a lockup now.
Huntsville. I'm reading you five-by. I'm ready for lockup now.
Huntsville LOS.
Huntsville AOS.
Huntsville LOS.
Apollo 7, opposite Omni.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. Walt, we're ready to bring fuel cell 2 back on the line.
It's been setting down; both buses have been down around 26.3 volts, Jack. It seems to me it would be a little safer if we waited another hour or so to bring it on. What do you think?
We're mulling it over here.
Fuel cells 2 and 3 are both heating up. They should be picking up. Well, we ought to go ahead and turn it on, I guess. We keep triggering the main bus undervoltage down there.
Okay. We concur.
Okay. Incidentally, it started happening when I turned the secondary coolant loop pump on; it was just enough to pull it down.
Roger. We were watching it.
It's back on the line.
Okay. We're watching it.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Wally, generally how is your configuration, stowage configuration for reentry now?
Okay. We're all stowed. We have the helmets stowed below our feet, and we're rigged up; we're not strapped in.
Okay. Are the O2 masks stowed someplace where they might be accessible in case of RCS injection on the chutes?
They are at the nominal point.
Okay.
And tell everybody to stop wringing their hands. We're happy. We've practiced this quite a few times.
Okay.
Practiced what?
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. Walt and Wally and Donn, I'll give you 164 dash weather. I'll update it. The weather is generally good; 1500 foot broken, 10 miles on the vis, winds are two ten at 15 knots, wave height is 4 feet. You've got a carrier on station, three helicopters, and two rescue aircraft.
And what's the carrier's call?
Essex.
They have a call, Jack, in lieu of a name.
Stand by, Wally.
Roger. Like we are Apollo 7, they are - they can put names on them.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. Wally, the call sign for the carrier is just the Essex. Your rescue aircraft are Kenby Rescue 1 and Kenby Rescue 2, and the helicopters are Recovery 1, 2, and 3.
Very good.
And I'll give you an update on the weather farther along.
It's a special case if the carrier is using her name.
Roger.
Jack, you read?
Go ahead, Wally.
I might add we all feel very good and chipper up here. We all got a lot of good sleep; we're well hydrated and had a lot of food, so there's not much more to do and let the computer work for us.
Okay. I think we're all the same down here.
Very good.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, Wally.
Are we over the recovery force now?
Just about, Wally.
We heard a call sign, Lucky Strike.
Okay. Wally, we got you for another 4½ minutes here.
Very good. We aren't having any luck with the sextant star yet; it's been behind the Earth. We'll try a daylight pass; and up to about retro minus 40 minutes, we'll give it a go. After that, we'll have to forget it.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Deke.
Roger. Did you conclude you could not get helmets on? Is that the problem?
No, we can get them on; we can't get them off.
Okay. But the mode we wanted was to have them on without being latched down to the neckring.
Deke, I can't get my hand in there, besides a handkerchief, and we're not at all safely braced for landing. We'll evaluate as carefully as we can.
Okay. I think you ought to clearly understand there is absolutely no experience at all with landing without the helmet on.
And there is no experience with the helmet either on that one.
That one we've got a lot of experience with, yes.
If we had an open visor, I might go along with that.
Okay. I guess you better be prepared to discuss in some detail when we land why we haven't got them on. I think you're too late now to do much about it.
That's affirmative. I don't think anybody down there has worn the helmets as much as we have.
Yes.
We tried them on this morning.
Understand that. The only thing we're concerned about is the landing. We couldn't care less about the reentry. But it's your neck, and I hope you don't break it.
Thank you, babe.
Over and out.
Say again.
Houston out.
Time, 258 hours, 26 minutes and 37 seconds -
Fix frames 52 and 53 of magazine N were window photography, window 4, and frame 54 was an archipelago.
7, we're about 1 minute LOS Bermuda; we pick up the Canaries at 33.
Roger, Jack.
Apollo 7, Houston through the Canaries. Standing by.
Roger. Jack.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead. Houston.
Okay. Walt. You can turn the SPS line heaters off now. We're showing a VALVE TEMP of 60 which is okay.
Roger. Turn them off.
Houston, this is Apollo 7, I'll be prepared to talk about the whole mission when we get back.
Roger, Wally.
7, we're about 1 minute LOS Canaries; we'll pick up Tananarive at 51.
Roger. We changed canister number 1 and put it back in.
Okay. Copy that.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read through Tananarive? Over.
Roger. Walt, we're reading about four-by.
Okay. We'll come up over Carnarvon. We have SECS LOGIC down; we're standing by for a pyro ARM; and I assume that you'll insure that we leave Carnarvon with a clean tape for reentry, and if you don't, would you let me know so I can COMMAND RESET and get it going before we deorbit?
Okay. Will do.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. Walt, we didn't see you initiate the DAP for the VERB 46 there.
I did initiate the DAP.
Okay. That's all we wanted.
Chute or what? Send another one. I went to DAP right after P30 instead of VERB 46. I'm checking.
Okay. We just didn't see it and wanted to confirm.
That's good, but it has been set.
Roger.
Apollo 7, we're 1 minute LOS Tananarive; Carnarvon at 06.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
Roger. Are we GO for pyro?
Stand by. We want to look at it here.
Roger.
Apo]lo 7, you are GO for a pyro ARM.
Thank you, Jack.
Pyro ARM.
Pyro A ON, pyro B ON.
One ON and two ON.
That's kind of a lot of fun to hear that.
Roger. We've pressurized our command module RCS. We seem to have had a chattering regulator for awhile.
Roger.
She's in compression.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Did you ever hear a Model A on a cold day. That's what it sounded like.
Roger.
We could hear it go through the lines. We're happy with the CM RCS.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7. Do you monitor our helium pressures on rings 1 and 2?
Affirmative.
Roger. We're reading 35; checklist calls for 4000.
It looks like it may be warming up.
Do you concur with the 4000 figure in the checklist, Houston?
Affirmative. We're watching it here; we'll let you know.
Roger. Okay.
We don't have a pump on the end, so we'll use what we've got.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Jack.
Stand by one.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Donn, our telemetry here shows that the RCS DAP has not been initiated.
Okay. We'll do it again.
Okay.
Okay. We'll check your telemetry out.
Roger.
What does that look like?
Stand by.
Okay, 7. We show it now running.
Very good. The call was worth it.
Roger.
We did initiate that before. I was quite surprised.
Roger.
Apollo 7, the DSE is yours; it's clean.
Roger. Thank you. Would you people initiate expulsion prior to deorbit burn?
Okay. Walt, you'll need to hit high bit rate and up telemetry to COMMAND RESET at that time.
Okay. We'll do it then, and we'll do it 30 seconds prior to the burn.
Roger. That's fine.
Apollo 7, we're about 2 minutes LOS Carnarvon. You want to turn up S-band for Honeysuckle?
Wilco.
Apollo 7, we're about 2 minutes Tananarive; we pick up Hawaii at 33. I mean Honeysuckle.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Okay. Direct RCS ON.
Check with Ron, Wally.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Roger. Just completed gimbal drive check.

Let's verify where the trim ended up.
It looks good.
Okay. BMAG mode 3.
Okay. Three of them, right? One rate two, one, two, and three.
Okay. We're standing by for 2 minutes.
I'll give you a time hack at 2 minutes.
Roger.
Okay. A final...
Thanks for the long hours of support, Jack.
Okay. It's been real fine, Walt. Just a final update on the weather in the recovery area: 2000 broken, winds 270 at 20, wave height at 3 feet.

Oxygen service module supply valve OFF, and you could be yawing 45 degrees out of plane, Wally.
Okay. Service mode supply valve OFF.
You got one more trip over there for the CAB VENT - CABIN PRESSURE RELIEF valve.
No, before, we want to go to BOOST ENTRY on those.
On both of them?
Yes. Right now.
Surge tank pressure is holding fine. I'm turning both VHF/AM's OFF. Antenna is on RECOVERY. S-band antenna is OMNI C.
Donn - Donn, service module RCS primary propellants A, B, C, D, ON, UP, talk-back's gray.
Roger. LOS. Lost signal downlink.
Roger, Walt, four gray ones.
Okay, we're standing by for Wally's call on the attitude.
In ATTITUDE.
Okay, CM/SM SEP, both ON. Now.
That work?
25-1/2 volts. That's all we got.
Okay, caution and warning mode, command module, RCS transfer. Did it transfer?
You got your ENTRY ATTITUDE, Wally?
Okay, RCS transfer - we verify command module - command module RCS LOGIC, OFF.
Okay, we've got ENTRY ATTITUDE. Do you want single channel? If you do, let me know.
You want to go RATES HIGH after that burn. Okay, well, I missed a callout.
Okay, the computer appears to be working fine, despite the low voltage.
I'm just talking to - us.
Yes, we ought to make note that the main BUS A and B undervoltages are down to 25-1/2 volts on both main buses. We're coming in, low batteries.
Give me a call when you are ready for RING - single RING.
B and D; the roll, pitch, and yaw to channel A.
And do you want RING A or B?
Okay, then, close B and D ROLL 1, MAIN A, PITCH, MAIN A, and YAW, MAIN A. Reading you 5 squared, Jack. Everything came off hunky-dory.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're back with you.
Reading you five-square, Jack. Everything came out hunky-dory.
Okay. We lost you there for about 2 minutes.
Standing by for a postburn update.
Okay.
We had two main bus A and two main bus B undervoltage at SEP, and we got all three batteries ON. There is nothing more we can do; we are reading 25.2 volts.
Copy that.
259 54.
You have RANGE SET, RANGE TO GO, V0 SET, ENTRY, EMS mode AUTO?
7, we'll have the postburn PAD for you in about 2 minutes.
Roger.
Everything's working beautifully, Jack.
Right. You're looking good. You're coming right down the line.
It's a slap in the face when we separate.
Roger.
DEADBAND MAX, RATES HIGH.
BMAG MODE, three, up to RATE 2 and ENTRY ATTITUDE.
The rest is on you, Wally.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Ready to copy.
Roger. Go with the preburn PAD. You were that close.
Thank you.
How about that?
You're looking real good, Wally. Coming right down the line.
Roger, Ron.
She's riding up.
We're on ring A, and she's a really nice control system.
Roger. Copy that.
You're still looking good, 7.

Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Okay. We're at 7500, gang.
We have three good chutes and we're descending very nicely. Our attitude very stable on the main chutes. We have a slight pyro odor in the cockpit; that may be fuel. We'll cheek that against something else later. We're going through the clag now.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger, we closed the command module RCS propellant at about 12 - 14 000 because of the odor in the cockpit.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Wally, if you have a chance, we could go to DUMP on the CABIN PRESSURE RELEASE valve, and all we'll have to do is close them later.
Let's go to DUMP.
We'll have to close them below a thousand.
Okay, I'll get my hand on it.
Broadcast everything we're saying.
Roger. We go to DUMP on the command module CABIN PRESSURE RELEASE valves. We'll open them - go to CLOSE on them below 1000.
Apollo 7, Houston.
My windows are steamed up.
So are mine.
I think that's probably from the moisture. That, might dry off.
Yes, we went through some clouds, that's for sure,
An RC - R - IFR approach, isn't it?
It sure is. We're cleared straight in, though.
Right down the slot. This is Apollo 7, descending through 4200 feet on an IFR approach, expect straight-in clearance, no delay, got the wheels DOWN and LOCKED!

This is Air Boss on station on recovery of the command module.
This is Air Boss. The command module is in stable I position, floating very nicely. The three uprighting bags are fully inflated. One swimmer is installing the flotation collar. One swimmer is now attaching the sea anchor; the other two swimmers are now attaching the flotation collar; the beacon has already been attached. The collar is now approximately one-third attached. There has been very slight scorching on approximately one-third of the area of the command module. The rest is.

Command module has no apparent damage to it at this point. The collar is now about to be attached; the two ends are now being joined by the swimmers in the water.
Roger.
There is no apparent sea dye in the water at this time that we can see. The inflation's about to begin.
The rotating beacon does not appear to be working at this time; however, the antennas - the two VHF antennas are erected. The swimmers are making the final check on the collar prior to inflation. The third swimmer is below the command module proceeding to take pictures. The rotating beacon is now operating. The two VHF antennas are extended. The three flotation bags are inflated, and photo I is now entering the area.
Air Boss, request clearance for PHOTO 1.
Photo I -

This is Air Boss. We have the beacon, and it is now operating properly.
Well, good! Just takes a little bit of switchmanship, I guess.
Stand by.
The procedures now - our cell has not been inflated arears to be no trouble at this time. The swimmers are just making final cheek. It's inflating and secure.
The collar is now starting its inflation. It is one-third inflated at this time. All appears to be normal.
This is Air Boss standing by about 5 miles away. Five miles. The command module bears 130 magnetic, 5 miles from your position at this time.
