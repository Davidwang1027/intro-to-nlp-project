Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Roger. I just did that daylight aligment, and we're told to pick a pair, and I picked out Rasalhague and Nunke. Rasalhague came in clear enough to mark on, but Nunki was a total loss because it's too close to the Earth's limb.
Okay. Understand you got a daylight alignment.
Roger. Well, I didn't complete it. I got as far as having to pick a pair of big looking stars, but you will never be able to find them yourself. But I saw this Ras-Alhague when I picked out something in the sextant and marked it. I assume it was Rasalhague because that's what we were going for. But the point is, daylight alignments aren't going to work too well unless you got far enough away from limb of Earth and other bodies.
Okay. Copy that, Donn.
And I think that doing a P51 under these conditions would be a dead loss.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 7, Houstom. One minute LOS Canary. Tananarive in about 12 minutes.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Roger. We've got a lockup in the comp cycle of program 21. Could you get a G&N bearing on us, or give us a handy dandy on what to do to correct that to get out of it?
Okay. I understand that you are locked up into program 21?
Roger, it's in the COMP cycle.
Is that correct?
In that time interim, we hit the PROSEED button, and the COMP light has been on ever since.
Okay. Stand by, 7. We're getting somebody to help us out here.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go.
Donn, can you tell us at what display you had in the program when you hit the PROCEED?
Roger, I had the time in, the NOUN 34 display.
We had the time went into normal ground track, and it usually only takes about a minute to calculate the position.
And it's been there ever since for several minutes now.
Could you say again? We missed the display.
Roger. NOUN 34. I loaded the data, hit PROCEED, and it's been in COMP ever since.
Apollo 7, Houston. I understand you had the time in there, and it was going to integrate ahead to figure out where you were, and that is the procedure you are talking about?
That's right.
Roger.
What time did you put in there, Apollo 7?
I put in 48:26 - 25 or 26. I don't remember now.
Houston. We've got a downlink path light also on our program alarm.
Apollo 7, we're going to have continuous coverage here through ARIA 1 until we reach Carnarvon.
Roger, understand. Ask him if I can do VERB 99? See if that will fix it.
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 1.
Apollo 7, Nouston through ARIA 1.
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 1.
Houston, Apollo 7.
This is Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're reading you five-by.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
Roger. Hear you, CAP COM Houston.
Roger. Real fine. Did you come out okay on P21, Donn?
Yes, it finally quit integrating. I'd already asked it to go to P00, so it went straight to P00.
Okay. Real fine. I've got some discussion on the primary evaporator to take up with Walt here.
He's listening. He's writing.
Okay. There will be some procedures, so you might want to copy this down. What we would llke to do is to determine the status of the primary water boiler, and then we - therefore, we intend to activate the primary evaporator over the stateside pass this revolution. So when bringing the evaporator on, Walt, we want you to open the back pressure valve manually for 2 seconds, since we're not sure how much water is in the evaporator, and this would minimize any possibility of carrying excess water through the steam duct and possibly freezing it. Then on the ground cue over the States, we would like you to first put the glycol evaporator H2O flow switch to AUTO. Second, put the glycol evaporator steam pressure to MANUAL. Third, go DECREASE for 2 seconds. Observe the temperature decay on the primary evaporator outlet. If you don't get any decay, we want to go DECREASE for 2 seconds more. If you get a temperature decrease, then wait 30 seconds; place the evaporator steam pressure to AUTO. We'll watch it all from the ground, but if you observe any anomalies in your out-of-ground conta, we would like you to troubleshoot per the malfunction procedures recorded on high bit rate on DSE and report it to the next site. And if you want any of this repeated, I'll go over it with you - a little slower.
I could write about half that fast, and I only got the first three steps, Jack. Back pressure open for 2 seconds; do you want me to do that prior to getttng into the States?
No, we will do this when we hit the States, so we can watch it here. We will tell you when we've got good data; and then when you bring it on, open it for 2 seconds. This will all be on ground cue. And then - I'll read these steps again, a little slower, Walt. First step, H2O flow to AUTO; second, steam pressure to MANUAL; third, decrease steam pressure switch to DECREASE for an additional 2 seconds. Observe for a temperature decay on the EVAP OUT temperature. Okay. If you don't get any temperature decay, decrease the steam pressure for 2 additional seconds. Then, if you get a temperature decrease on the EVAP OUT temperature, wait 30 seconds; then place the glycol EVAP OUT steam pressure to AUTO. Okay. If you get any anomalies and you're out of ground contact, troubleshoot it per the malfunction procedures, recording it on high bit rate, and we'll pick you up at the next site.
Roger. Jack, I got step 4. Decrease steam pressure for 2 seconds, watch the glycol EVAP OUT temperature decrease, and disconnect set.
Okay. After temp decrease is observed, wait 30 seconds; then place the steam pressure switch to AUTO.
I have here decrease something for 2 additional seconds.
Okay. Let me go over it again.
Two seconds.
Okay. You go to MANUAL, decrease the steam pressure for 2 seconds; that's step 3. If you don't get any temperature decay, decrease - third, decrease steam pressure switch to DECREASE for an additional 2 seconds. That's step 4.
Roger. I understand that if I don't get any pressure decrease - temperature decrease in how long a time period?
About 30 seconds - give it 30 seconds, Walt, to note any temperature change.
Roger. The back pressure open for 2 seconds on your cue; water flow to AUTO on cue. Steam pressure to MANUAL, decrease steam pressure for 2 seconds. Watch the glycol EVAP OUT temp decrease; if no temp decrease in 30 seconds, then I - decrease steam pressure for another 2 seconds. If I get a decrease, I wait 30 seconds and then go to AUTO. Any anomalies, I troubleshoot.
That's good; you got it. Okay, Apollo 7. You might want to turn your S-band volume up; we're about to pick up Honeysuckle here.
Roger, Jack.
We'll just be standing by here. We don't have anything special for you.
Okay. You might find out what rate they want set up for this G&N attitude control test.
I didn't copy that, Donn. You were a little garbled.
I said, the G&N test: what rate do you want put in?
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston through Honeysuckle.
Got you, Jack.
Roger, Jack.
Okay. You're five-by. On Donn's question, it was that weight W-E-I-G-H-T or rate R-A-T-E?
R-A-T-E, Jack.
Okay. Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Go, Houston.
Okay. Donn, what we would like to have is a spacecraft maneuver rate, at somewheres - rate 1 degree per second or greater. In the DAP, we would like you to set 4 degrees per second in the rate.
Eisele had 10 flicks of water at 48:59.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Roger, Jack. Hey listen, on this G&N test, we don't want to build up a rate, then take it out. That wastes too much fuel, and we are a little shy anyway. What I was asking you is what rate setting you want on the DAP load, but I'll just use 0.2, and I suggest we just put it in wide DEADBAND, ATTITUDE HOLD, and let it sit there awhile.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston with an update.
Roger, Jack. What is the update?
Go with your update.
Apollo 7, do you read? Houston.
Roger.
Okay. Donn, we have an update on DAP rate deadband we'd like you to set in; we would like you to set in two-tenths of a degree per second for the rate deadband for this G&N attitude control test.
Okay. I got that in.
Okay. Real fine.
Jack?
Go ahead.
I'm not going to do that 1 degree per second because it wastes too much feel. What I will do is just go ahead and put it in G&N attitude hold at deadband for two-tenths rate and then let it sit around here for as long as you want to look at it.
Okay. You want to - we copy that. We'll give you - we haven't picked up high bit rate here; we'll give you a hack as soon as we have high bit rate.
Okay. I'm ready to copy your log data.
Roger. I'll give you that. Opposite omni first.
Apollo 7, Houston. We have high bit rate; you can start the G&N attitude control test; and, Walt, I will give you the block data.
Roger. This is now.
Okay. Block data for block number 6 as follows: 033 dash 4C plus 314 minus 1450 52 plus 05 plus 09 4335, 34 dash 3C plus 200 plus 1500 53 plus 21 plus 42 4119, 035 dash 3B plus 250 plus 1390 054 plus 55 plus 07 4143, 036 dash 4A plus 250 minus 1659 056 plus 46 plus 40 4785, 037 dash 3A plus 315 plus 1390 058 plus 07 plus 17 4439, 30-38 dash 3A plus 283 plus 1374 059 plus 42 plus 35 4645.
Roger. Readback follows: 033 dash 4 Charlie plus 314 minus 1450 052 05 09 4335, 34 dash 3 Bravo plus 200 plus 1500 053 plus 21 plus 42 4119, 035 plus 315 plus 1390 058 plus 07 plus 17 4439, 38 dash 3 Able plus 283 plus 1374 059 plus 42 plus 35 and 4645. Over.
Roger. Walt, we had a transition from Hawaii to Huntsville, and I lost a little bit of it here. The second block was 034 dash 3 Charlie instead of 3 Bravo. And I lost you right after 035 dash 3 Bravo. Could you give me that down to the beginning of 037 dash 3 Able?
Roger. I'll-pick up. 035 dash 3 Bravo - I O got your correction - 034 dash 3 Charlie and 035 dash 3 Bravo plus 250 plus 1390 054 plus 59 plus 07 4143, 036 dash 4 Able plus 250 minus 1659 056 plus 46 plus 40 4785. Over.
Roger. That's got it. We copied five-by.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. On this primary evaporator activation: we are going to wait until we get a RAD OUT temperature above 50 before we start it.
Roger. Do you have any idea about what time you want to do that? It doesn't get above 50 until after we have been in a daylight pass most of the pass.
Roger. We are just discussing that now. It looks like the way it's coming up, it's going to be a little bit.
Roger. It hasn't been coming up. You are talking about the evaporator outlet temperature, I assume; it hasn't been coming above 50, until to the last part of the daylight pass.
No, we were talking about the RAD OUT temperature, Walt, just so we can make sure that the boiler is going to really work.
Okay. I'm showing a RAD OUT temperature now of just about 50.
Okay. Stand by here.
We are only showing a RAD OUT of 42 degrees, and we are going to check CAL curve right now.
Roger. I am reading 49, about on border; 3 paint scale. Let's say 45 to 50.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go, Houston.
Okay. Donn, on that RAD OUT, when - we are reading 43 now, and there is a big spread between your value and ours, and ours is correct according to the CAL curve, so it will be a little bit yet before we get to activation of the evaporator.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Are you on VHF now?
Affirmative. We are receiving VHF; we are SIM0 on transmit.
Okay. Fine. There for a while, it seemed you were only ou S-band.
Apollo 7, can you tell us what direction you are pointed at relative to the sun?
What direction - what? Say again, Jack. Why don't you read our gimbal angles and figure it out? You can probably do it better than we can.
Roger.
It's coming in the left side window; it's a little bit forward of us.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are going to delay activation of the primary evaporator until Ascension. We will contact you at Ascension in approximately 8 minutes.
Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS Antigua.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Roger. This is Apollo 7. We're standing by for your evaporator procedure. I can - -
Okay. Walt, we're going to wait until we get high hit rate here. We've got a keyhole effect which is going to delay our high bit rate for a minute or so, and then we'll be ready to start.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're ready to start on the primary evaporator test. You can open the back pressure valve manually for 2 seconds.
Are you ready to receive this procedure?
Okay. You want to put your water valve to AUTO?
You want me to decrease for 2 seconds first, don't you?
Okay. Walt, we want to go AUTO first on the water valve.
Jack, on S-band.
Okay. Walt, read you five-by. You want to...
The steam pressure came down to.15, and glycol evaporator outlet temperature is coming down.
Okay. Understand.
I am going to go AUTO on the steam pressure because the glycol evaporator outlet temperature is down.
Okay. We'd like you to hold it for 15 seconds.
Do what?
Hold off on putting the steam pressure valve to AUTO for 15 seconds here.
Roger. I had it in there; I just took it back.
Okay.
Okay. Apollo 7, you can put the steam pressure valve to AUTO now.
Roger. It's in AUTO. The glycol evaporator outlet TEMP is reading 38 on board.
Roger. We copy.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are about 1 minute LOS; we would like you to continue this procedure; watch the glycol EVAP OUT temperature. If you get amy anomalies, then record it on the high bit rate; we'll pick you up over Tananarive.
Roger. What time for Canaries?
Tananarive will be - 50 hours, 1 minute.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Roger, Jack. And the water boiler seems to be operating normally now.
Okay. Real fine.
It evaporated normally after we.
I think he said it evaporated normally since he left Ascension. I wonder if he is evaporating now.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Tananarive; we pick up ARIA 1 in about 3 minutes. We'll have continuous coverage through Carnarvon.
Apollo 7, Roger.
This is Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
ARIA 1, go REMOTE.
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 1.
ARIA 1 AOS.
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 1.
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 1.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
Roger, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston. We have a CSM and S-IVB state vector update we'd like to send you. Would you go to ACCEPT?
You have it.
Coming up.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead.
In the flight plan, we have AOS Hawaii at about 5 plus 45.
Roger.
Control test.
Roger.
It took us 20 minutes. We performed that during the tracking exercise for the rendezvous. I'd like to hold off that type of PPO until after we have our third burn.
Okay. Stand by.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. We concur on delaying the attitude control test until after burn 3.
Roger. I think we met the requirement, Jack, but if we can check the data from the previous revs, we might not have to do that one.
All right. Let's do that. We'll check it.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Jack.
We're trying to get an inertial attitude hold angle that we would like you to go to to further evaluate this primary evaporator, and we'll try to get you these angles early so you can take your time maneuvering there. What we want to do is heat up these radiators as much as possible, and it won't have to be a tight attitude hold at all, just want to get as maximum a heat on the radiator as we can to give us a lot of confidence in that primary evaporator.
Roger. What time spread are you talkin about?
Next stateside pass.
Wilco.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We have roll, pitch, and yaw gimbal agles for this evaporator evaluation.
Go.
Okay. Roll 218, pitch 129, yaw 18.
Jack, is that 18 degrees?
Roger. 018, excuse me. Yaw is 018.
You can maneuver there as slowly as possible and set up the MAX deadband, and we'll evaluate this over the States.
Okay. What time would you like this new attitude?
For the day pass, Wally, over the States.
Okay. It'll be approximately 50 hours and 45 minutes.
Okay. Real fine.
I'll read back: 218 roll, 129 pitch, and yaw.
That's 218 roll, 129 pitch, 018 yaw.
I have that.
Okay.
And, 7, we have finished with the loads; we have verified them. The computer is yours.
Roger.
Jack, do you have a NAV update for us?
Say again.
Do you have a NAV update for us after that state vector load?
Roger. That was CSM and S-IVB state vector.
Roger. Don't we do the NAV update to validate?
Okay. Stand by.
I have your NAV cheek; are you ready to cody?
Stand by. Okay. Go.
Okay. Sextant track time 051 plus 35 plus 0000 minus 2779 plus 02505 1549.
Roger. 051 35 0000 minus 2779 plus 02505 1549. Over.
Roger.
Did you read that, Jack?
That's a correct readback; that's 154.9.
154.9. Roger. And copy.
Okay.
Okay. It looks like we're right on, doesn't it?
That's speedy work up here, Dorm.
Stand by.
the DSKY. You've got an update.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Roger, Houston. We're drifting in attitude now.
Roger. Real fine. Wally, when we hit the States, we'd like to switch over to a deadband as long as we are holding attitude for this radiator - or evaporator evaluation. We'd like to switch over to a deadband, and we'll kill that DTO, that G&N attitude control test at the same time. I will give you a call over California when we would like to set in the rate.
And it...
The deadband is expensive; it's about 5 pounds an hour, and we've done that during the rendezvous maneuver.
Roger. We understand that. This will only be for a minimum of 10 minutes.
Bill, that's about 1 pound.
I mean...
Prior to the SPS burns about 5 to 10 minutes each. - We're saying that SPS will be depleted.
And by the way, Houston, Hawaii is part of the United States now.
Roger. I understand, Wally.
You are showing your age, Jack.
Houston, Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Roger. There is Somthing we have never made note of before. It happened during spacecraft tests and does here as well. When the twelfth maneuver is put in, the gimbal drive reflects that maneuver - even though the clutch current is OFF - plus or minus about half a degree.
Roger. I understand.
It's just an anomaly; might surprise subsequent crews.
Okay. We copy.
No problem.
Houston, the reason we are resisting burning up fuel is that we're not really -
We just had a good view of a contrail en route to Hawaii.
Roger. Opposite omni, 7.
Roger.
Wally, we are having some more discussion on that MIN rate over the States here. We'll let you know.
We're right on the border line on fuel as far as making our line good.
Roger. We understand.
We're doing the next steps later.
Huntsville two wheel log, valid range.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We'd still like you to go ahead and set in that MIN rate, complete this G&N attitude control test. This will be the mtnimum cost fuel-wise right now.
Roger The you got here is exactly the same.
Roger. We understand.
Okay. I don't think you people understand real well. We are still testing.
Roger. Understand.
All be prepared to debrief on this subject when we get back.
Yes, sir.
It's in hold now.
Roger. We are timing right now. We will give you a MARK in 10 minutes, and the test will be complete.
Roger.
Deke, you look like you're wide open today.
Roger.
You got a little spotty cue over Dallas, a little spotty cue offshore. Looks like you have about three- or four-tenths coverage today.
Okay. I haven't been outside for about 6 hours, so I don't know.
Jack, after this G&N burn, do you want us to hold it in SCS like programmed?
Roger. Wally, after we get through this, you've got about 4 minutes left, then hold attitude in the cheapest way possible there.
Roger.
And as soon as we hit the night pass, you are on your own.
Grand Bahamas looked beautiful today.
Say again, Wally.
The Grand Bahamas looked beautiful today. We took a lot of good pictures with the Hasselblad. We got one of Houston, one of Tampa; that's about the rate. It takes about 3 minutes to recock it.
'Roger. We copy.
Probably the loop inside is jamming it up. It's in the box itself, not in the lens shutter mechanism and not in the magazine.
Okay. We copy that.
We recomend carrying at least two of these boxes along and the accessories to go with them.
Okay. We copy that.
Roger.
Houston, the water boiler hasn't been boiling since we been - have you been putting all the heat on the radiator, or making believe it's cool? Over.
We've been trying to get the MAX heat on the radiator; we expect it to start boiling here. We are showing a RAD OUT now of 50.
Roger. So am I, but my glycol evaporator outlet sensor's still seeing 48.
Jack, give me a reading when we go off this DAP control.
Roger. You have got about a mtnute and three-quarters.
Okay. Then I'll fly in SCS for how long?
Looks like it's starting to boil. Let's see if it overshoots.
Roger. We concur.
Now long will I stay in the SCS mode?
Stand by one.
Are you observing my steam pressure now?
Affirmative. And darkness occurs, Wally, about 51 25, 51 25.
Then we are going to stop holding attitude, right?
Affirmative.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 7. Are you reading my primary evaporator now?
Affirmative, 7.
Roger. Did you note the evaporator outlet temperature overshot all the way down to about 34.
We confirm, and we show it coming back up.
Okay. Apollo 7, we've completed 10 minutes in MIN deadband; you can come out of MIN deadband and go to the cheapest way possible for attitude hold.
Roger. SCS.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 7. Go ahead.
Roger. We feel that for all purposes your primary evaporator is working normally. You can discontinue attitude holding.
Roger. All chanels OFF.
Roger.
Do you want us to go ahead and operate the glycol evaporator then, and see if we have a reoccurence of the earlier trouble?
That's affirmative, and we will match it, too.
Thank you.
10 clicks of water for the LMP at 5 - at 51 hours and 17 minutes.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Apo.llo 7. Roger. Loud and clear.
We're standing by.
Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read?
I read you five-by. We're standing by.
I took the camera apart and used some nose cream and cleaned up some of the inner gears, and it looks like it is going to do all right now.
Roger. Copy. And I have a flight plan update on that - the PAD for the star - sextant star count whenever you are ready to copy.
Go ahead with your flight plan update, Jack.
Okay. GET SR will be 53 plus 36, roll will be 40, pitch will be 92. Delay that roll. Roll will be 4, pitch will be 92, yaw will be 359. GET of sunset minus 12 will be 54 plus 18, roll will be 184, pitch 97, yaw 359.
Roger. GET sunrise 53 plus 36, attitude 004 for roll, pitch 092, yaw 359. Sunrise minus 12 minutes will be 54 plus 18, roll 184, pitch 097, yaw 359.
Roger. That's correct.
Okay. Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, Wally.
Roger. Me still have reservations about the SPS angine. It looks good to us so far, but we don't have any data from you, though.
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Wally, could you confirm your reservations about the SPS engine? Does that have to do with the GPI movement that you observed?
Negative. We had a mission rule beforehand with the Flight Director that we would not go into the SMS (which is reserved) until we knew that we had a good SPS engine.
Okay. We copy.
Roger. I'd like one more burn...
Okay.
At this point.
We understand. Stand by. We'll be - discuss that.
Gyro-torquing angles are minus 0.420, minus 0.175, plus 0.149.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Roger. We got a report angles for the realignment: minus.420, minus.175, plus.149. Are you Antares and Peacock, a triangle difference of four balls 1.
Roger. Donn, I've got a.175, a.149; I didn't catch the first one.
The first one was a minus.420.
420, a triangle difference of four balls 1, and say again the stars.
A. Antares and Peacock; And on the angles, the first was a minus, second was a minus, the third was a plus.
Roger. Copy. And Walt, is Wally on the line?
Yes.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Jack.
CDR here.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Schirra speaking.
Roger. About the SPS problem: after discussion down here, our feeling is that the SPS is Go. Hovewer, we have a DAP service module RCS deorbit capability at the present time, and we are within 10 feet per second of an SCS service module RCS deorbit capability.
Roger. That was our figuring, too. We'd like to hold that reserve as much as possible after the full turn. We'll get to.
lower perigee here, I think we'll feel much more comfortable.
Wally, we aren't able to read you this time. We'll pick you up with that last transmission over Carnarvon.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Walt's doing his second fine alignment. He did pretty well once he figured out that there weren't any numbers pasted on the star ball.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
Roger.
Houston, could you read our DSKY then?
Roger. Flight. No data yet.
Apollo 7, we don't have data yet.
Roger. We have a display. It will take hold in a second. This is our gyro torquing angle.
Okay. Stand by.
Houston. I did the fine align check and used Peacock and Rigel, star angle difference five balls, torquing angles plus 021 minus 049 plus 017. Over.
Okay. Copy that, Walt.
He's back.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Can you give me a GET - an approximate GET that you did that fine align so that we can compute some gyro drift rates?
Roger. The line was completed at about 51 40.
51 40.
51. Fine align check.
Roger. Copy.
Do you want the first one or the second one, Jack? He did two of them.
Stand by.
The first one was about 51 40. I think that's the one you want for your drift check.
Okay, 7. The first one, 51 40, will be fine.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Do you also have the time you did the fine align check so we can get that one, too?
That was at 51 51.
Okay.
Got that.
Roger. Copy that.
And - Apollo 7, Houstcn - we feel that on the basis of what Donn did on the daylight align test, that you can delete that P52 which comes at 55 plus 00 in the flight plan. Do you concur?
Stand by.
Roger. We concur.
Okay. You can delete it.
Roger.
Jack, if we happen to be in a favorable latitude, I might take another crack at it, but...
That's fine with us.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Roger. Can you talk about the SPS results now that you had observed on the ground?
Go ahead.
Negative. What did you observe?
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston. On the - we relooked at all the strip charts on the SPS operation: ball valves, the temperatures, everything on the SPS appears normal.
Very good. It seems that way here.
Okay. Real fine...
information, I would like to have the number 3 burn before I give up the SM RCS budget.
Say again on the SPS number 3 burn.
I would like to get the SPS number 3 burn in before I eat into the SM RCS deorbit budget.
Roger. We're going to look at that.
Roger.
We are about 1 minute LOS Carnarvon; will pick you up in Guam in about 5 minutes.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Read you five-by.
Roger. We just saw a sunrise in the sextant.
Say again?
Our navigator is excited about sunrise in the sextant.
Roger. If you decide to delete the P52 realign at 55 hours in the flight plan, you may go ahead with your G&N and SPS power down early, at your option.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead.
This will really break you up. We're having competition to see who can get the Exer-Genie first.
Roger. I say again that if you decide to delete that P52 realign at 55 plus 00, you can go ahead and power down the G&N and SPS early, at your option.
Roger. Understand that. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Roger. We have the S-IVB in sight at this time through the sextant.
Roger.
How far away is it now, Jack?
Stand. by. I'll get it.
Okay.
Stand by one; we'll get it up to you.
Jack, by the way, the slot panel light that wasn't lighted...
Stand by.
Say again, 7.
The slot panel light that was not lighted was the minus Z panel.
Roger. Copy.
Minus Z, as in Zebra.
Apollo 7, Houston. The S-IVB is 312 miles away.
Roger. We're seeing it loud and clear in here. I don't know if it will hold up throughout the entire day pass because when I get this orange background from the six liner pad, it might blot it out, but I'll keep you advised.
Okay. You are 1 i minute LOS Guam; Hawaii in 7 minutes.
Roger.
Jack, do you have a map update for us?
Roger. We'll get you one. If I lose you here, we'll get it to you over Hawaii.
Roger.
Apollo 7, ready with the update?
Roger.
Okay. REV 33 GET of the node 52 plus 04 plus 32, longitude 139.2 degrees east, right ascension 05 plus 54.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Hello, Houston. Roger. that S-IVB - I think what happened is the auto optics quit working, or it wasn't working right, and I saw it go out of the top of the sextant, and I never was able to recover it.
Roger. Copy.
Up to the time it happened, it seemed to be working pretty well. I had done a few marks, and it appeared to be pulling it in a little closer to the center although not as well as it had done on the previous run.
Okay. We copy that.
I think it deserves a pretty good plus so far.
Apollo 7, I didn't copy the last part.
Roger. This is CDR. I say it deserves a pretty good plus so far.
Okay. Real fine.
Don't want the boys in Boston to get too excited yet.
Roger.
Why did the top of the band?
Magazine Q, frame 20, Baja California.
Roger. Copy.
Wally, coming over Texas in about 5 or 6 - 3 or 4 minutes, we'd like you to turn your S-band volume up, and we're going to be transmitting S-band only.
Roger. At 21 east coast, west coast, Baja California, and we'll shoot Guaymas shortly.
Okay.
Give us a call when you want the volume up, Jack, cause...
Okay. You can turn S-band volume up now; we are just about to acquire Texas.
Correction on Guaymas that and upper third of Baja California.
Roger.
The Hasselblad is working fine with a combination of oral grease removal and nose cream.
Roger. Copy that.
Apollo 7, Houston. Transmitting S-band for backup check.
Roger. We read you loud and clear.
You are five-by.
Roger.
Mexico looks very nice today; a lot of strato cu. It looks like it would be good weather for the Olympics.
Roger. Copy that.
Frame 26, magazine Q was a straight shot down at the coast of Mexico just south of Monterrey.
Roger. Copy.
Looks like a nice day to be on the beach.
It sure does.
What's your temperature down there today?
It's pretty nice down here; we had fog in the
Roger. Magazine Q, frame 24, eastern coast of Mexico.
Hollo, Houston. This is your captain speaking as we fly across the Gulf of Mexico where we are clear to the Yucatan Peninsula. The west coast of the Yucatan looks loud and clear, and we will give you a report on clouds on arrival.
Okay. And we are going back to VHF in just a few minutes here so you can turn the S-band volume down in about 2 mtnutes.
Roger.
Twenty-five and 26 west coast and Yucatan Peninsula, west coast on VHF. We are crossing now.
Roger. Copy.
We are referring to magazine Q for Queen.
Roger.
Frame 75, a river in northeastern South America.
Roger. Copy.
Sounds like you got some nice scenic music.
Roger.
Apollo - Apollo 7, Houston. Could we get you to switch the BIOMED switch to the CDR?
I think that's a portion of "Fools Rush in Where Angels Fear to Tread."
Roger. We copy your switch position.
Roger. Are you playing music, Jack?
Negative.
We hear a song, "Fools Rush in Where Angels Fear to Tread." that's why the romark. We have some real good music up here.
It isn't me.
Okay. How's the readout this time?
It's a Houston radio station; just heard the call. It's FM, probably.
You might call around town and find out who played "Fools Rush in Where Angels Fear to Tread" at about 52 hours And 26 minutes - 25 minutes.
Roger. We copy.
Apollo 7, Houston. Standing by, Ascension.
Roger. We read you loud and clear.

Apollo 7, Houston. I have a fight plan update.
Apollo 7. Go ahead with your update.
Roger. The time, 54 plus 40; H2 heaters ON; at 55 plus 00, H2 fuel cell purge.
Roger. That's 54 plus 40 and hydrogen purge at 55 00.
Roger. At 57 plus 50, O2 - oxygen fuel cell purge.
Roger. O2 purge at 57 50.
Roger. End of update.
Apollo 7, Houston. Standing by Guam.

Houston, Apollo 7.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. Were you calling?
Roger. I had a butterscotch pudding bag failure. it failed as I was rolling it up to stow it.
Say again, Wally.
I had a food bag failure that failed when I was rolling it up empty to stow it.
Roger. Understand.
No problem. I can still see 50 stars at this time at this attitude. There is a kind of a light square forming in the middle of the States.
Roger. And you say the count is 50?
More than 50; more than 50.
Greater than 50. Roger.
plus 4 minutes.
Okay. This time a light is beginning to creep into the sextant - into the telescope all around the edge, and there is a big, broad band of light across the center and a blob down at the bottom; and this light is slowly increasing in intensity, and I suspect that in a few minnutes it's gonna blot out the whole field of view.
Roger.
Roger. At 44 I see ten stars. I can see Orion's belt and the four corner stars and Sirius and, oh, a handful of others scattered around. There's about 10-12 stars.
Roger.
Thirty seconds LOS.
Roger. We are with you.
Apollo 7, Houston. Request onboard batt C voltage at your convenience.
Roger.
Roger. I've got battery C, 37 volts.
Roger. Thirty-sevon.
Has anybody taken a good look at the total battery load we have on batt A, batt D? I know we didn't get back as much as we expected to on battery A yesterday.
That's affirmative, Walt. We are looking at it.
Hey.
Hey, Ron.
Go.
I'm in favor - I guess I'm leaning toward another battery charge, if necessary, a little further down the pike.
I see what you are saying. You think that we may require another battery charge later on sometimes.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Houston. Go.
Roger. We are standing by our second tissue bag at 54 hours into the flight.
Roger. Your second what?
Our second bag of tissue.
Incidentally, you might note that the ORDEAL storage box - after the ORDEAL is out and closed up again - makes a nice little locker for stuffing things into. The little hole that's open - you can stuff it in; then later dump it into the empty tissue box.
Roger.

Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS. Tananarive at 46 minutes.
Did you read?
Magazine Q, frames 42 through 44 were taken of Las Brisas Harbor, Acapulco, Mexico. They were taken at 54 hours and 10 minutes into the flight.
Roger, there are four stars hidden dimly in view at sunset minus 12 minutes.
These stars are just sort of visible at the - if you look off to one side, you can see them a little bit. Dark adapting wouldn't do any good for this particular test, because there's so much daylight in the instruments and the telescope. The same light pattern I described before - an angular pattern around the edge of the thing and a broad belt across the center plus a big blob down at the bottom - it's not quite as bright as it was during the other test, but it is there, and it's going to prevent me from being dark adapted.
I picked up about 25 stars at sunset minus 8 minutes. The light - no identifiable constellatioss at this time, I don't know what part of the sky I'm looking at. I can take a look at somewhere at the southern hemisphere, but - in the vicinity of Acamar or Achernar, whichever it is, there's this big void spot down there; it's hard to find stars in.
One of the things that obscured this star data is the fact whenever the jet fires or the overboard vent vents, you get a lot of particles that reflect light, and you can't see anything except that. All I see is a big field of bright spots out there.
This at sunset minus 4 minutes and still obliterated by the field of particles, not possible to see the stars for the little bits and pieces coming out of the vent.
Okay, this is sunset. We still have the same problem, these particles are flying around and there's no way that I can - particles are still flying around at sunset, and there's no way I can distinguish stars from particles. I think the reason we didn't see these at the test at sunrise Was that the spacecraft has been running cool through the dark side of the Earth and probably wasn't boiling any water at that time. That terminates the star count.
CDR, 10 clicks. And an afterthought, one Lomotil.
Apollo - Apollo 7, Houston. Tananarive standing by.
Roger. Ve've logged another food bag failure, and we powered down at 54 35 for a drifting site configuration.
Say again time, Walt.
At 54 35, we powered down to the drifting site configuration, and I have another food bag failure to report.
Roger. How did the second one fail?
I had the second one, and it was A3, AOB for the LMP - the chocolate pudding. But the failure occurred at the spout where it comes out at the eating end, and it seems to have given away near the begins.
Did you receive, Houston?
Walt, I got part of that, but I couldn't get it all. Chocolate pudding bag failed, but I'm not sure how, yet.
Okay. It failed at the eating end. It was not one of the external seams, but it made it impossible to eat it.
Roger. I understand now.
Chocolate pudding A3, AOB.
Roger.
That last pass along the western coast of Mexico, we got several nice pictures of the Las Cruces harbor and Acapulco, Mexico.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Houston. Go.
Roger. I'd like to give a report on the way we're eating. We're eating, I'd say, as much as we can get down, which is about two meals a day, so far.
Roger.
Donn Eisele may change the pace. He eats about two and a hAlf meals a day.
Roger. Donn is a big eater.
Say again?
Roger. Dorm is the big eater.
That's a fact.
We've been on the Exer-Genie now as much as 30 minutes at a time, and we've doubled the workload on it, and there's not much more we can do. If we're not hungry, we don't eat. I think we're all feeling pretty chipper; there's no discomfort up here. My cold is improved considerably.
Roger. That's good.
A subject that we are concerned about is the chlorination of the drinking water. We're drinking about as much as we can. I'd say that we've drunk enough water to lower the quantity sufficiently to have a chlorine check.
Say again, Wally.
Roger, we're due to add more chlorine to our potable water. We have not consumed enough of it to warrant adding a lot of chlorine to it.
We can't say subjectively - we do not object! to the taste at this point.
Apollo 7, Houston. Say again about the chlorine and potable water.
Roger, we query the advisability of adding chlorine on schedule to the potable water. At this point, there is not an objectionable taste to the water.
The advisability of adding chlorine on schedule to the potable water.
Houston, Apollo 7. Still read? 10 clicks of the water gun for the LMP at 54 hours and 53 minutes.
Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds to LOS; Mercury at 09.
Roger.
At 55:09 GMT or GET, 16 frames or test position movie was made of Orion with the Moon in the background, known as the pigtail in space.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury.
Roger. Do you read that?
Roger. You're a lot better this time. Can you say again your question about the potable water and chlorination?
Yes, Ron. We - adding chlorine to the water quantity that has not decreased since we've been taken off practically. And if the taste of the chlorine has not bothered us yet, but we feel we haven't taken enough water out of there to warrant adding chlorine on a 24-hour basis.
To better illustrate the picture...
Okay. Understand your question now, amd we'll check into it.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Roger.
This is Apollo 7.
Houston. Go.
At approximately 20 minutes ago, the prime rate evaporatQr ran into the same kind of problem it had earlier in the flight. The steam pressure went all the way dovn peg low, and they could not increase it by going to MANUAL and the INCREASE switch. I reserviced it for 2 minutes and operated manually for another couple of minutes and finally went back to AUTO. And it's been running fine for the last 20 minutes - maybe longer - I guess more like about 30 minutes ago.
Roger. We copy.
Apparently, it's a case of the evaporator drying out instead of the evaporator being frozen.
I couldn't get too many details about the 2TV-1 test, but it seems to me it could be similar to what happened in the chamber a couple of times. And there might be something we could bring up to maybe get it fixed before the next flight.
Roger. Concur.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go.
Roger. We would like to confirm that you have completed the H2 fuel cell purge.
That's affirmative. Completed at approximately 4 minutes past the hour.

Not this pass, Walt. We have no data here. We should be able to pick that up over Mercury, though.
Thank you.

Roger. Is this the Hasselblad that's not working too good?
Roger. We've got it fixed, so it's ticking along now.

We only took two rolles of the S0368 on the 16 mm: one for separation and turnaround maneuver and one on the final phase of the rendezvous. We are going to be using some of it out the window if it seems appropriate.

Roger. Your number 2 flow proportioning valve bas been doing a good job this last rev, and we recommend returning to ECS radiator flow control number 1 by switching to number 1 then back to AUTO.
What's wrong with letting number 2 do the job?
Roger. We just prefer to stay on one as it does a little better.
You mean because it's a smaller number, or what?
Okay. We'll return to one for you. We were wendering when you would spot that.
Roger. We checked it with Mercury the last time around.
We're kinda afflicted today, Ron. Bear with us.
Roger.
Walt, on the battery charging, we're not considering any additional battery charging of A until we observe what happens when we charge battery B.
Roger. I understand, but we probably have reason to expect battery B to go up to about 35 or 36 amp hours too, which shouldn't leave us in very good shape, I don't believe.
Roger. I understand your concern. Also, Walt, we need some command module heater temps when you get a chance. They're five and six, A through D, on your system status. No hurry.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go.
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Roger. About, oh, it must have been a little over an hour and half ago, we had another anomaly like on the first night when Donn was awake; all of a sudden the DC bus 1 went to zero on the readout and A - DC bus light.
Walt, say again after AC bus light; went through a keyhole there.
Well, something is taking the inverter off of AC bus 1, and we're hitting the RESET, but they're right back on again.
Roger. It looks like the same thing that happened to Donn, then.
I'd say that it is.
Apollo 7, Houston. Switch omni.
Go ahead.
Apollo 7, Houston. Could you confirm that when you had the AC fail, was it an AC bus or an AC overload light?
bus light or overload.
Say again, Walt.
You're awful weak, Walt. Say again.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 7. Did you read my last communication?
That's negative. Say again.
Roger. I had AC bus 1 light on, no overload. The inverter was automatically disconnected, and I'm wondering if there isn't some possibility of having trouble with that inverter putting out an overvoltage?
Roger. We're working on this. Can you associate this with anything else that was going on at that time?
That's negative.
And it wasn't associated then with the flow proportioning valve switchover?
Not associated with anything that I can think of.
Roger. You're not giving us much help.
This one is going to be a witch hunt, Ron.
I think so.
This is one of those things that sort of happened. It's also the reason why we're going to keep somebody on watch all the time.
Yes, I don't think there's anything you can do about it, Ron. I'm just reporting that we have had it happen twice.
Okay. We're scratching our brains down here to see if maybe we could came up with something.
It'll give you something to do during passes anyway.

Roger. We'd like to give the results of the rendezvous radar self-test and confer on the use of the rendezvous radar power and heater switch. Would yOu pass that up to us, Ron?
Say again, Walt.
We have to know the exact position of the rendezvous radar heater and power switch so we can use the rendezvous radar self-test. We don't have that on board with us.
Roger. Awful hard to understand. Something about a power switch, and I'll guess which one. I'll find out.
Rendezvous radar power switch, and it's a prepositioned switch, the other end of it.

Roger. The rendezvous transponder power switch: you put it to HEATER for 1 minute and then to POWER for the self-test. By the way, you leave it 24 minutes in HEATERR if you are going to really operate it. System test left hand, the TRANSPONDER, right hand to Alpha. Indicator should be 1 to 5 volts. Systems test right hand to Bravo. Indicator 2, plus or minus 1 volt. Systems test right hand to Charlie. Disregard the indicator. Systems test right hand to Dog. Indicator should be 0 to 4.5 volts. Over.
I'm getting very broken; we'll have to wait for Ascension, I think, to get a good separator.
Roger.
Do you read, Apollo 7?
Apollo 7, Houston. Roger. Read you now.
Roger. You might try it again. You were broken the first time, and I couldn't read you at all.
Roger. Rendezvous transponder power switch goes to HEATER for 1 minute, then to POWER.

Apollo 7. Go.
Roger. We see no BIOMED downlink on the LMP.
I wanted to fly; now I got to go get it up.
Say again, Wally.
Roger. We've got the cable all hooked up.
Roger.
We're getting down to keeping only one man, on watch at a time, and that's going to answer a lot. He's not sleeping, Just milling around, staring, and housekeeping.
Say again.
You want LMP now?
How are you reading my heart?
Stand by.
Is my heart coming in five-by-five?
Roger, Walt. We have it now. Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS; Mercury at 28.
Roger.
Frame number 58 was of the shoreline of the Arabian coast.
At 61 hours and 5 minutes into the flight, we had a MASTER ALARM and no caution-warning light lighted. And we didn't know really what caused that. At 61 hours and 22 minutes into the flight, we had a MASTER ALARM; AC BUS 1 and AC BUS 2 caution-warning lights came on, and both buses, all phases. The voltage was less than 90. Both buses reset and the voltage on all phases, all buses manual in between 114 and 116.
Other than that, we have no problems.
Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Mercury.
Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read?
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Roger. We had a traumatic experience up here that kept us up half the night. one of the reasons is we had two regs shut down and power outage which came back immediately afterwards. And we had a ground right after that which didn't last too long and now a read-out on the caution and warning panel. Over.
Apollo 7, Houston. I will call you again in about 30 seconds. The signal is very poor. All copied is something about caution and warning panel.
Houston. Apollo 7. Do you read?
Apollo 7, Houston. You are unreadable right now.
Houston, Apollo 7. Say again.
Houston, Apollo 7. Say again.
Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read?
Okay. Did you read my last?.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. I read you about strength one and virtually unreadable.
Roger. Do you read me now?
Roger. That is much better. Go.
Apollo 7, say again.
Apollo 7, Houston. At acquisition Mercury, you gave me a transmission. All I copied was something about caution and warning panel. Would you say again?
Houston, this is Apollo 7. Just prior to crossing the Red Sea, we lost AC bus 1 and t AC bus 2..
Both buses reset almost immnediately. Prior to that time, we had lost - had had a caution and warning alarm and no indication of what caused it. Over.
Apollo 7, Houston. Understand just after crossing the Red Sea, you lost AC bus 1 and AC bus 2. You have obtained RESET. I am going to wait over Guam and go with this again. I am missing too much of the transmission.
Roger. We're up here standing by.
Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read?
Roger. Loud and clear.
Okay. I am sorry to have you repeat this again. But I did not get the full message there. I got something after passing the Red Sea. You had AC bus 1 and AC bus 2 fail. You did get RESET on both buses. Is that correct?
That is correct, approximately 61 hours and 14 minutes. About 9 minutes earlier, we had a master alarm, but no caution and warning lights indicated.
You had no caution and warning lights.
That was 9 minutes earlier. If you recall, we had a bit of ghosts earlier in the mission. We also had an AC 1 bus failure when we lost a compressor twice, and it came back up again. Apparently, we've got a trend here that I'd like to have more information about.
Roger. Understand. You think it is a ghost. Now - just to make sure I have it correct. You do have both AC buses working normally now.
That is correct. I am not sure kind - what kind of ghosts we have, but we have had master alarms and no indication as to the cause.
Thank you.
Hey, Bill, We got one more thing that may or may not be significant, but after I reset the first master alarm with no caution or warning light, I checked the currents on all the fuel cells, and we were averaging a little over 20 amps per fuel cell, and now we are back to about 15. And, at first, I attributed that to a cycling load. I don't know; it could possibly have been AC loads. I don't know.
Roger. Understand. Immediately after RESET, you monitored the fuel cell currents at 20.0 amps, and they are now reading 15.0.
That is a negative. After the master alarm, with no caution or warning lights, at 61 09 is when I noticed the fuel cell currents. The other two caution and warning alarms when the bus failed were 61 14. Over.
Roger.
If we sound puzzled now, we were not then.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are getting a tape dump here at Guam, and we will be taking a look at it and be trying to give you a call at Redstone on this.
Okay. There is not much we can do right now, but I would like to find out what we have left if this continues.
Roger.
All I know is that there is a lot coins in the water.
Understand.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute till LOS Guam; Redstone at 01.
Roger.
And - Apollo 7, Houston - I would like to confirm a canister change at around the 58-hour point.
That's affirmative.
Thank you.
At 61 hours and 57 minutes, it's noted that the cabin temperature indicator now shows 70 degrees, and the suit temperature scale is showing about 53 degrees. Immediately subsequent to powering down to get to flight configuration, it was noted that the suit temperature was like 55 degrees and the cabin temperature was about 75.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. I was a bit optimistic. It'll take a little longer to look at those tapes, but we did get a dump over Guam, and we'll be giving you our analysis of the situation as soon as we get it. In the meantime, I'd like to go back over my notes and make sure that I have the story correct. Okay. The way I have it: at 61 plus 09, you got a master alarm light with no caution and warning lights? You reset the master alarm. Okay.
At that time, fuel cell current was averaging 20.0 each. At 61 plus 14, you got ac AC 1 and an AC 2 fail. You reset both AC 1 and AC 2 successfully. At the time that you were talking to me, about 61 plus 30, the fuel cells were averaging 15 amps, one-five amps. That is the story as I have it copied.
Apollo 7, Houston. Did you read?
Houston, Apollo 7. You read?
Roger. Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read me?
Read you fine now. How me?
I read you about four-by-four. Did you get I my transmission there?
Affirmative. The details are correct. The time was 61 plus 05 for the master alarm and 61 plus 14 for the bus fail.
Apollo 7, Houston. Copied the correction, 61 plus 05 for the master alarm.
And the fuel cell loading may or may not be significant. That was the third AC bus 1 failure we've had and the first AC bus 2 failure, and best onboara analysis is to track it down to a transient overvoltage, but guiding onto both buses, which seems kind of difficult.
Roger.
Did you read?
Houston, Apollo 7. Did you read?
Roger. Go.
Did you read my last transmission, Bill?
Roger. Understand. You have - this is the third AC 1 failure, the first AC 2 failure that you've experienced. You are doubtful - you are in question as to how a transient overvoltage can throw both AC's off line. Is that your question?
That's affirmative.
Okay. We're looking at it. We will be looking at that and trying to give you a complete story as soon as we can put it together.
Okay. And confirm we have a good tape running now.
Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are rewinding the tape now. The tape will be yours at LOS.
Roger. Thank you.
LOS in about 3 and 1/2 minutes.
Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up on LOS Redstone; Ascension at 27.
Roger. We'll be standing by.
And the tape recorder is yours now.
Understand?
Houston, this is Wally. Houston, this is Wally.
Go.
Roger. You might just check into our configuration on the last minute variance on inverter safety wiring.
Roger. Check into the inverter safety wiring.
There's a new change in the glitches that they had at the plant.
Roger.
I think Wally's referring to the change where they disconnected the overload transit.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7. Go.
Roger. AOS Ascension, and we're still studying the problem.
Okay.
No sweat here right now. Everything's normal.
Roger. We just finiched the playback and are still looking at it.
Good show. Walt and Wally are sacking out, so I'll he minding the store in the meantime.
Okay, Donn.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Ascension; Mercury at 04.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Acquisition Guam.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. About 1 minute 30 seconds LOS Guam. Redstone at 36, and we'd like to confirm BIOMED switch center.
Roger. Stand by. Switch at center.
Roger. Understand. It is at center.
Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Redstone.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 7. You're very weak. Go.
Roger. We detected a CMC power-up over Guam. Was that a valid reading?
That is correct. I powered it up and went state vector integrate up and put it back down.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute to LOS Redstone; Canary 07.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Canary.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Just for your information, we have about a 6 and 1/2 minute pass here, and then it's going to be about 1 hour before we pick you up, and that'll be ower the Redstone.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7. Go.
Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read me?
Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read?
Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read?
Apollo 7, Houston. Switch Omni, please.
Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read?
Read you five-by, Bill.
Okay. Good. I wanted confirmation because I'm going to read off a fairly lengthy procedure. We have a procedure developed here to assist in locating the AC bus problem.
Okay. Fine. Stand by, and I'll get something to write it down on.
Go ahead with your procedure.
Okay. You can probably do it as I call it out. First, which AC bus is powering the following: cabin fan?
Roger. Cabin fans are OFF.
Roger. Cabin fans are OFF. Next, glycol pump.
Stand by. Glycol pump on AC1.
Roger. Glycol pump on AC1. Next, suit compressors.
Suit compressors on AC1.
Roger. AC1. Do not change configuration.
Roger.
Okay. Number two. We would like for you to check the six CRYO fan circuit breakers on panel 226 and report if any are popped, but do not push them in.
Stand by.
Roger. All the CRY0 breakers are in.
Hoger. Understand all of them are in. Thank you very much.
Opposite omni, please.
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston. We would like you to switch omni for maximum signal strength. We'd like to get some TM before we have LOS here at Redstone, which is going to occur in about 45 seconds.
Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Antigua.
Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Antigua.
Roger, Bill. Loud and clear.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute until LOS Antigua. Acquisition Canary at 40. I will have a flight plan update at that time.
Roger, Bill. See you in about 4 minutes, then.
Roger. Four or 5 minutes; that is correct.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. I have the flight plan update.
Let's proceed with the update, Bill.
Roger. At 66 plus 15, delete the radar transponder selftest.
Roger. Understand. Delete the test at 66 plus 15.
Roger. At 69 00, add unstow and set up TV camera.
Roger. Understand. Set up the TV.
Roger. At 69 plus 50, delete the reference to H2 heaters ON.
Roger. No heaters ON. Understand.
Roger. At 70 hours, 70 plus 00, add fuell cell O2 purge.
Roger. Fuel cell O2 purge at 70 hours.
Roger. And that is 71 plus 41, TV ON.
Roger. You want the TV ON at the same tine when we're doing the rendezvous radar test. Is that correct?
No, I think the rendezvous radar test is - stand by one. You're right. Wait just a minute. Let me get this cleared up.
Okay.
Meantime, would you switch omni, please?
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Would you confirm opposite omni? We are having a little trouble with TM.
Roger. I went from C to A. I'll try Bravo.
Roger. And that is the correct tine for TV ON.
Roger. TV ON at 41 plus 41. Is that right?
Affirmative.
That is the end of the flight plan update.
Roger. If you don't want the TV on until 71 hours and 40 minutes, I think we will hold off unstowing it. The thing is in the way when it is up, and we would rather not be running into it all the time.
I didn't hear it.
Understand you want the TV running at the same time we're doing the - or will be doing the radar test.
That's affirmative. That's the confirmation I get here.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni, please.
Roger.
And - Apollo 7, Houston - for your information, I am pretty sure this TV ON time is tied into the Texas acquisition time.
Yes, that figures.
Apollo 7, Houston. Would you confirm or report the position of your PMP power switch?
Stand by.
PMP is in NORMAL; it's UP.
Normal.
Would you go to AUX, please?
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Canary; Carnarvon at 18.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7. Go.
Roger. Acquisition Carnarvon, and I'd like for you to check a couple of things for us, please. S-band normal mode PCM switch to PCM, and-_the power amplifier barber pole.
Roger. Now am in barber pole and the PCM switch is in PCM.
Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Carnarvon. Request S-band volume up for Honeysuckle at 25.
Roger.HONEYSUCKLE (REV 42)
Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Honeysuckle.
Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Redstone.
Roger. Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
7. Go.
Roger. Have you made any cahnge in the COMM system, particularly TM settings?
I took the recorder for about 30 seconds to record water intake. Haven't monkeyed with the TM settings.
okay.
Bill, have you all got command of the tape.
Have we got what?
Roger. I put the tape and ran for 30 seconds to record something and then left it off so it wouldn't continue to run.
No. I don't think that did any harm.
Are you receiving things on the tape dump.
Did you go to up-telemetry COMMAND RESET?
Apollo 7, Houston. Did you go to up-telemetry COMMAND RESET?
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston. If you read, go to S-band OFF to tape.
Apollo 7, Houston. About 30 seconds to LOS; Antigua at 03.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Houston, 7-
Roger. Acquisition Antigua.
Roger.
I would like to get a confirmation on something. Did you go to COMMAND REST when you used the tape?
That's affirmative.
Roger. Ground advises do not use DSE as voice log. We have lost TM subcarrier, and we can't get data while you are dumping.
We're working on it; we're trying to fix it.
Roger. Say again.
We're working a lost TM subcarrier problem.
Roger.
Also, we would like S-band off AUX to TAPE.
Roger. It's in TAPE.
Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Apollo 7, Houston. We would like for you to stay in the present COMM configuration until further advised. We are having some difficulties on that TM.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition CanAry.
Roger. Houston.
And let's see, we'll be at Carnarvon about 50. I will have a state vector for yoh then.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Roger. Stand by.
Roger. 1
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Canary; Carnarvon at 50. Would like. P00 at Carnarvon acquisition.
Roger. We'll have it.
Thank you.
Apono 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Confirm P00 and ACCEPT.
Roger. I'm in P00. I'll go to ACCEPT. I would lik1e for you to take a look at this program alarm 1105 that we have been getting off and on through the flight. I got it again here about 5 minutes ago.
Roger. That would've been about 26.
I'm in ACCEPT now.
Roger.
Have a NAV check to go with the CSM NAV vector that it is coming up, if you can get ready to copy that. And I also have an update for the rendezvous radar bests.
Roger.
Go ahead with your NAV check.
Roger. NAV check: 071 11 0000 minus 2914 plus 14170 1593.
Roger. 071 11 0000 minus 2914 plus 14170 1593.
Readback is correct. When you are ready, I can give you the rendezvous radar test update.
Go ahead with that update.
Roger. Starting with T align 70 plus 58 159 degrees, 055 017 71 plus 39 71 plus 43.
Roger. Understand. 70 plus 58 159 055 017 71 plus 39 71 plus 43.
Readback is correct. Donn, I have an analysis to this AC problem. I'll go over it and see what you have - what your comments are.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. Point 1, we have spent considerable time going through the data here. And we have noticed that the AC bus glitches are associated with the cycling OFF of O2 CRYO fans. This is causing the AC bus to surge to overvoltage. It seems as though this is only a problem at low power loads on the AC bus, but it has been noticed repeatedly.
Okay. That - sounds pretty logical.
Point 2; recommendation O2 fans tank 1 OFF, do that. This will insure AC 1 stays on line. If our analysis of the problem is correct.
Roger. What about AC 2. We have that one, also.
Roger. You'll have that one ON. We will periodically switch O2 fans tank 1 back to the ON position. At the same time, O2 fans tank 2, OFF. This will insure at least one AC bus is protected at all times from this surging to overvoltage.
Roger. I see. If we get fired up again, do you think we will still have this problem?
I'm not sure. It seems as though it is not nearly as much a problem when you're powered up, it is only when you're in a low power condition. The voltage control is more sensitive tends to overshoot or something there.
Okay. I'll turn tank 1 off for now.
Roger. Understand.
We're probably going to get some stratification when we've proved out on this stratification test.
Roger. We have taken that into consideration.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are having a little trouble getting the CSM NAV vector up. If we don't do it, I'll read it up to you over Honeysuckle, that'll be about 67 plus 59 and will require S-band volume up.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. I'm going to have to read you the P27 update if you have the PAD out there.
Apollo 7, Houston. Do you read?
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston. We will not have to give you a P27 update. We were able to uplink it.
Apollo 7, Houston. Do read?
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston through Texas.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Good morning.
And how are you, sir?
Very good.
Oh, very well.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go.
Donn, I've got your block data number 8 for you. Also, could you switch the BIOMED switch tO CDR, and could you confirm that you have turned the CRYO fans tank 1 OFF?
Roger. CRYO fan tank 1 is OFF, and Wally's still asleep, but he doesn't have his BIOMED hooked up.
Okay. Copy that.
Will get it on him when they get up.
Okay. Re al fine.
You can go with your block update.
Okay. This is block data number 8: 045 dash 1 Alpha plus 311 minus 0638 069 plus 57 plus 34 4259, 046 dash 1 Alpha plus 313 minus 0638 071 plus 33 plus 1 A1fa 4405, 047 dash 1 Alpha plus 272 minus 0649 073 plus 08 plus 47 4593, 048 dash 4 Alpha plus 297 minus 1650 075 plus 52 plus 37 4202, 049 dash 4 Bravo plus 318 minus 1650 077 plus 28 plus 29 4321, 050 dash 3 Alpha plus 265 plus 1371 078 plus 47 plus 51 4161.
Say, Jack, I'm going to have to ask you to run those by again a little slower, and it might do to stop now and then so I can butt in and tell you if I'm missing any.
Okay. Donn, I guess I'm a little faster than you are this morntng. Okay. Did you get - where do you want me to start? At the beginning?
Yes, I think you might as well.
Okay. Going back. 045 dash 1 Alpha plus 311 minus 0638 069 plus 57 plus 34 4259, 046 dash 1 Alpha plus 311 minus 0638 071 plus 33 plus 18 4405, 047 dash 1 Alpha plus 272 minus 0649 073 plus 08 plus 47 4593, 048 dash 4 Alpha plus 297 minus 1650 075 plus 52 plus 37 4202, 049 dash 4 Bravo plus 318 minus 1650 077 plus 28 plus 29 4321, 050 dash 3 Alpha plus 265 plus 1371 078 plus 47 plus 51, 4161 end.
Okay. Readhack follows: 045 dash 1 Alpha plus 311 minus 0638 069 57 34 4259, 046 1 Alpha plus 311 minus 0638 071 33 18 4405, 047 1 Alpha plus 272 minus 06 49 073 08 47 4593, 048 dash 4 Alpha plus 297 minus 1650 0755237 4202, 049 dash 0 Bravo plus 318 minus 1650 077 28 29 4321, 050 dash 3 Alpha plus 265 plus 1371 078 47 51 4161.
Roger.
Donn, could you read the latitude in 046 dash 1 Alpha.
Roger. I've got plus 311.
Should be plus 313.
Roger. 313. Thank you.
Okay. That's got it.
Jack?
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Just checked PPO2 and got 235 millimeters.
I didn't copy that, Donn. Say again.
Okay. Partial pressure O2 on the cabin is 235 mm.
Roger. Copied that, and Donn, we're through at the computer now. You can go to BLOCK on your UP-TEL switch. Also, you have a GO for 62 dash 1.
Roger. Understand. GO for 62 dash 1.
Apollo 7, Houston through the Canaries. Standing by.
Roger. We are powering up the SCS for the G&N at this time.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Roger. We took frames 44 through 47 on magazine O Oscar at 68 hours and 54 minutes. This was a picture of the weather formations around the Canaries.
Okay. Roger. Copy that, and Donn, when you get a chance, we would like you to switch your flow proportioning valve to one then back to AUTO again.
Okay. Done.
Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston. You're about 30 seconds LOS Canary. You sure look good going over the hill. We'll pick you up at Carnarvon in about 28 minutes.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
Roger, Houston. Good morning, Jack.
Good morntng, Walt. How are you this morning?
Fine.
We'll be standing by.
Hey, Jack. I have a question on our low quad. We had one quad yesterday that was reading 47 percent. Are we going to want that quad propellant pressure around the 43-percent level, or are we going to switch to secondary propellants open loop at 43? Over.
Okay. Stand by. I'll get G&C on that here.
Apollo 7, Houston.
GO ahead, Houston.
Walt, you are about 25 pounds away from the point at which you should switch, which is about 6 percent; so you are quite a ways away, so there is no need to hurry on that now, and we'll give you, when you start getting close, a gage reading of which you should switch.
Roger. And will we switch quad by quad?
Affirmative. Quad by Quad.
Okay. We need a map update, please.
Say again. Oh, a map update? Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston. We'll be talking to you. We'll pick up Honeysuckle in about 4 minutes. We'd like you to turn up your S-band.
Roger.
And I have your map update, Walt.
Go.
This is for REV 43. The GET of the node is at 68 plus 29 plus 00. Longitude of the node, 122.7 degrees west, a right ascension of 05 plus 33.
Roger.
I just -
Apollo 7, Houston through Honeysuckle.
Apollo 7, Houston through Honeysuckle.
Roger. This is Apollo 7. Can you read?
I read you five-by now. We need to switch the BIOMED switch to CDR.
Roger. Won't do any good; he's not plugged up.
Okay. When he gets plugged up, would you do it?
Okay. I get a high-pitched squeal on S-band. How about you?
Roger. Walt, we've commanded backup voice there because we've lost the PM, and we're going on FM now. We got the voice on the FM subcarrier.
Okay. What's the status ou our tape recorder?
Stand by.
APOllo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Walt, when you want to use the tape recorder, go to low bit rate and RECORD. When you are ready - when you are through recording and want us to dump it, let us know, and we will interrupt real-time data and dump it.
Is this a change for our normal operating procedures for the flight?
I am not reading you any more.
Okay. Walt, what we have lest is the PM downlink. We are on the PM downlink now, which means we are time-sharing DSE with real-time downlink.
Roger. Have we lost that permanently?
It hasn't been determined yet. We are going to do a little bit of checking here.
Okay. Well, I'll take the tape recorder back and - on 69 hours and 39 minutes.
0kay.
You are going to still keep the bookkeeping on it?
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. LOS Honeysuckle; pick you up at Guaymas.
Apollo 7, Houston through Guaymas.
Apollo 7. Reading five-by-five.
Roger. Five-by. Walt, we want to delete these COMM tests that we were going to do over this stateside pass here or over Canaries.
Roger. Understand.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Hello, Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Roger. We have a computer problem. We are unable to get a MARK in.
And as a result of this, we are not aligned at this point and possibly will not be able to support the WSMR test.
If I copy you, Wally, understand you have had a problem in aligning the platform, and you may not be able to support the WSMR test. Is that Charlie?
That is Charlie. The problem apparently is the MARK button.
A problem with the MARK button. Roger. Understand.
Yes, we hope that's what it is, Jack. It was attempted in the P51, and in step 4, we have a flashing 51 and calling for a MARK. We pushed the MARK button repeatedly, and it will not go on to the next display. Apparently, it's not accepting the MARK, or else the MARK button is filled; I'm not sure which. I did check - I did check a bit in flagwood 74, the L53 flag, and that was set when the 51 was flashing. I also did a CNC self-check that turned out okay; and we did a halting 53 - by that I mean we just ran through the program without actually maneuvering. It seemed to work fine. We did punch the ENTER button, and the computer progressed through the program.
okay. Roger, Apollo 7. Looks like we're reading your DSKY now. You're still on Program 41 with NOUN 70?
Negative. We've got P00 in there right now. Do you want me to call it back up?
Okay. Yes, I guess we missed a lockon data.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 7. On our pre-mod processor here, we had a failed normal pre-mod processor.
Roger. Understand. Copy that you had a failed pre-mod processor, and you're going to run the rest of the flight in AUXILIARY.
That's negative! We are operating in AUXILIARY now per your request duaring the evening; and I'm trying to find out - are we going to have to operate there the rest of the flight?
Walt, we're working on a troubleshooting procedure on this. I'm sorry I missed part of your transmission.
We'll be troubleshooting this, and we will get you a reading on it shortly.
Hey, Jack. When I got up this morning, we had already been told by ground to go to PMP AUXILIARY earlier in the evening, and I'm wondering is there trouble with the NORMAL; and if not, we'd like to get back so we can operate the tape recorder the way we started.
Just a minute, Walt.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go, Houston.
Roger. Walt, we had a problem last night with the NORMAL PM where we lost voice telemetry subcarrier of the NORMAL PM, and we're devising a troubleshooting procedure now. We'd like for you to stay in this present configuration until we've gotten that procedure up to you. You can use the tape recorder as you want as long as you are in low bit rate.
Okay. I picked up the tape recorder when it was already played out. I rewound it; it's standing by for a dump now in case he has something on it. Do you want a dump?
Walt, did you have very much of a voice transcription on that tape recorder?
I don't know, but the whole tape has been recorded so it's going to take you about 8 minutes for a complete dump.
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Go.
On the tape recorder, there's nothing there that we feel we'd like to dump it for, anless you have made some voice transmissions in there that we don't know about.
The only thing we might lose that I can think of would be some of the film log? and I think we can cover that another way.
Okay. We won't dump it then.
Okay. We'll go ahead and only data run when we want to record something. That way we will limit the amount of time required for dumping.
Roger.
Apo]lo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.

Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7. How do you read? Over.
I read five-by. We've got a few thfngs to try, Donn, to check the MARK button.
Roger. Say again, Jack?
We have something we would like you to do to verify the operation of the MARK button. While in program 00, we would like to have you press the MARK button and verify whether you get a PROGRAM ALARM.
Okay. Here goes. I do not get a PROGRAM ALARM.
Okay. If you don't get a PROGRAM AIAEM now, press the MARK REJECT button while in P00 there and see whether you get a PROGRAM ALARM.
Roger. Pressing MARK REJECT, I get no PROGRAM ALARM.
Roger. Copy that. During this next night pass, we would like you to try P51 again. If you don't get any response from the MARK button, then try P53 and P54.
Jack, do you have any.
Roger. Copy. Stand by.
Roger. We used quite a bit of fuel on 53. We'd like to have an update on our fuel status. This is the reason I'm concerned about it, and I sure do TV problem.
Okay. Wally, stand by. We are going to discuss that here.
Okay. Realize that if we do 53 and use the COAS for burns.
Roger. We understand.
Pretty busy getting set up here. Guess you want to watch our close up on the TV.
Okay. We will discuss that, Wally. We will be back to you. In the meantime, Walt, we would like to have you read off the positions of your S-band NORMAL and S-band AUX switches here so we could start the troubleshooting procedure on this PM.
S-band NORMAL switches are in VOICE, POM, and RANGING; S-baud AUX is still in TAPE; and I guess I may as well turn the tape switch off. I still have power switches SCE NORMAL, PMP on OFF. Over.
Roger. We copy.
What are the position of your transponders, Walt?
I'm in SENCONDARY of the transponder and the power amplifier in HIGH.
Okay. Copy. We'll be back...
Hey, Jack...
Go ahead.
tape now; why don't I turn the tape switch off.
We'd rather have you just leave it on, Walt.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Go.
Okay. If we can't get through the P51 and 52 using the MARK button, go ahead and use the COAS and get 53 and 54 for the IMU alignment.
Roger. Tom, my concern is, are you willing to expend the service module RCS fuel for the radar transponder test, or are you asking me to be willing to?
Well, the whole thfng, Wally - we want to get the platform aligned first and see what we've got. We'll talk about the rest of it down the line over Carnarvon.
I think we've got a problem, and I go along with getting the IMU alignment, too.
We'll try the COAS one time. It's worth it one time in case that we can't get the optics going.
Okay.
All right.
Will you give us a total number of pounds of propellants remaining? I can put it in my.
Yes. Okay, Walt. We're going to give you this over Carnarvon.
Standing by.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Your total usable RCS fuel now is 750 pounds.
That is 750 pounds; goes on my chart at 70 hours into the flight. I want total number of fuel because I think, on my chart here, the unusable is already taken off the bottom.
Okay. The 750 is usable.
Well, would you take a look at your copy of my onboard chart and give me a number that I can stick on that?
Okay. Walt, we'll pass that over to you over Tananarive. We're about to lose you here. Tananarive at 13 minutes.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Walt, the reading that you should be having on your chart for RCS fuel is 808 pounds.
Roger. 808, 58 plus the 750 you gave me.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Tom.
Okay. I want to cheek how this alignment is going out. We've already worked out with Steve Cops here a real slick little way of doing 53 and 54 using those optics down below that should cost us very little fuel. And be about as accurate as 51 and 52.
Okay. Do to you want go through and read that one again?
We've got 4 minutes. Do you want me to read it ovex?
Do you read, Tom?
Apollo 7, say again.
Yes. Tom, will you go through that again a little bit slower? I was a little bit behind in copying down the procedures, I'm ready to go again.
Okay. We go through step 1 and and 2 of P53, and you can use the coarse align option if you want to, but we acquire the stars within the telescope.
Roger.
Okay. Once we get the NAV star in the telescope, then go ahead and get it into the sextant.
Okay. I see, then we.
Okay. When you get it into the sextant, then you can hit VERB 16 NOUN 91 to read the shaft and trunion of that star.
Roger.
Okay. With that value, you go back in step 3 - you see flahing VERB 06 N0UN 92? - you can enter NOUN 92, which is the value you have read out.
Roger.
Then proceed.
Okay.
Then you can use the ENTER button for your MARK.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Apollo 7. How is the alignment coming?
We are styli star reading right now.
Okay. Understand you are still in progrmn 53.
We are just trying to acquire a star at this point, Tom.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. I'll go ahead and brief you on vhat we've got planned.
Wait. Let's wait, Tom, until we get done with this alignment.
Yes, yes, okay. I'll just stand by here.
Okay. I would like to get this other one started.
All right.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, Wally.
Okay. Donn is busy right now. You got a message for him or could I take it?
That was too fast. Say again.
Donn is in the MARK routine right now. Is the message for him, or could I take it?
No, it's for the whole crew, and the main thing is to get the platform aligned. And, Wally, if you would turn up the S-band at 71:08:45, we will talk to you through Honeysuckle.
Very good. We did need the arm to curve on this TV cemera; we will try to get it up for you.
Okay. We want to see how the platform alignment comes out, and we will talk to you over Honeysuckle.
Okay. I'm not going to rush into anything else but that.
Okay.
Aplllo 7, Houston.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Okay. Right now, when Donn is reading the NOUN 91, is he reading is he going to monitor real time with VERB 16 or VERB 06?
I am using 16, Tom, and I am hitting a NOUN to freeze it when I get right on.
Okay. That sounds good, Donn. Sounds real good.
Apollo 7, this is Houston through Honeysuckle. How do you read?
Apollo 7, this is Houston through Honeysuckle.
Hello, Apollo 7, this is Houston through Honeysuckle. How do you read, Wally?
Hello, Apollo 7, this is Houstcm. How do you read?
Hello, Apollo 7, Houston. Over.
Apollo 7, this is Houston standing by through Honeysuckle.
Apollo 7, this is Houston. How do you read?
Hello, Apollo 7, this is Houston through the Huntsville.
Hello, Apollo 7, this iS Houston through the Huntsville.
Hello, Apollo 7. This is Houston.
Huntsville AOS.
Standing by.
Hello, Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read?
Roger. Coming very weak, Apollo 7. How do you read? Houston.
This is Apollo 7. Do you read? Over.
Roger. Now reading you about three-by. How did the alignment go?
Two-way lock.
Hello, Apollo 7, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
We are aligned at this time so I'm getting you in the blind.
Roger. Understand you are aligned.
Apollo 7, this is Houston tbrough the Huntsville. We'll be piking you up over California, Guaymas shortly.
Roger. You are coming in very weak. We are aligned. I am alining the GDC at this time.
Roger. Good show. Understand you are aligning the GDC.
Say again, Wally.
Houston, do you want TV this pass?
Roger. We'd like to get WSMR and TV if we could.
Roger. Let's give it a go.
Roger.
Hello, Houston, Apollo 7. How do you read now?
Apollo 7, this is Houston. Loud and clear. How's that for you?
Roger. you're coming in loud and clear, Wally. Sounds like, that alignment technique worked out pretty good, right?
I'm just picking up my ORDEAL right now.
Good show.
Star angle difference is about.18 degrees.
That's not bad.
Tom, we went ahead and did a P54 alignment to the align time that you gave us to of 70 hours and 58 minutes.
Okay. That's what we wanted.
Okay.
Okay. We'll try to attltude.
Roger. What we want you to do for WSMR pass - and this will be over on Watt's side - we want the DSE recorded in lov bit rate for the test. We want the DSE to start at 71 plus 39 plus 00. We want the DSE to stop at 71:46 plus 00.
Roger. We got it.
Okay. Now after we finish WSMR, when we come up for the TV pass for - Walt, make sure that the tape position is OFF. Over.
Roger.
Roger, just stand by and keep panning.
Okay.
Tape OFF now.
Okay. Walt, againn, the tape should stop the DSE, and the tape OFF at 71 plus 46.
The tape is stopped now, and the DSE is running, and I can keep the DSE running. Can I keep the DSE running with the TV on?
Yes, you sure can, Walt. No problem.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Looks like we have a real pretty day down here.
Roger. That's the way it looks from here.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead.
Roger. At what time do you want the TV turned on
Say again.
At what time do you want the TV turned on?
Stand by. Roger. We are ready for TV now. Turn it on.
TV going on. Let us know when you are receiving a picture.
Okay. It goes through a scan converter. We're looking at it now.
Can you read it?
Well, we're looking - down here. Just stand by and keep panning.
Roger.
Hey, Tom, would you repeat the time for DSE STOP? I was down below when you gave it last time.
Say again.
Repeat the time for DSE STOP.
DSE at 71 plus 46 plus 00.
Roger. 46.
Apollo 7, Houston. Verify you're on omni Alpha.
Verified.
Roger. Looks like the signal strength is a little low down here.
Okay, we're watching.
I'm reading 1 volt is all, and we did not get a full 20 minutes to warm up on that thing.
We're getting 1 volt on our test meter.
Okay.
Hey, we got you. I can see Eisele talking there. Hey, Donn, turn your head to the right. There you go. Hey, we're picking up - I can read it; just a minute. It says, "From that lovely Apollo," something - you guys shoud write - "High atop something." It looks good; I can see Wally handle it now, and Donn has a smile on his face, and there's Walt. "From the Lovely Apollo Room High Atop Everything." The definition is pretty good down here; I can see the center hatch. Actually I am amazed; it looks real good. Hey, Donn, how about saying something since you're panned.
Say again.
Hey, I can read you and can see you loud and clear. It really looks good. I am amazed.
It's coming in heads down. You want us to point...
Lean back a little bit; you are too close to the camera. There you are. We'll have Cecil B. De Stafford down here directing.
(Laughter.)
Roger.
You forgot to shave this morning, Eisele.
Lost my razor.
Some of the reproductions here are real good. I can look out through Wally's rendezvous window. I can see the COAS up there, the ORB RATE ball.
We're looking right down the Gulf Coast.
Okay. What's the next one? Little closer, Wally.
It says, 'keep those cards and letters coming in, Folks.' It's loud and clear.
Yes, sir, there's plenty show for the whole family. Would you like to get a look out the window with the TV camera? I can give you New Orleans right here.
Okay. Let's take a look and see how New Orleans is this morning.
Roger. Coming up over the Mississippi River. I'm giving you an out-the-window picture. You should see Lake Pontchartrain coming into view now.
Okay. We're looking.
We're changing lenses. That's a pretty wide Lake Ponchatrain he gave you.
Okay.
There you go.
Roger. You got the telephoto cm there?
We are just crossing about now over Mobile Bay.
Okay.
Should get it about now.
Okay. We're starting to get it. Looks like there's a few clouds down there. Yes, we can see it. Is that the coastline you're panning right now?
Going over Mobile now, and quickly, and we'll be coming across Pensacola shortly.
Okay. Wally, can you focus one spot for a minute? We can see the orbital rate coming in real fast. There you go. Try to hold it on one spot. Now you can see the coastline.
There's a paper mill north of Pensacola that I'll train on.
Okay.
We have a beautiful day; you're right. Should give you a good shot of the Cape today.
All right. Yes, there's the coastline; it's coming in good.
Roger.
Real good.
You might get a kick out of the fact the constellation we used for alignment was.
All right.
we used for alignment.
Okay. Are you passing over Florida now?
Affirmative.
Okay. If you can just hold it. The big thing on that long lens is just to hold it still for one spot and then move to another, it looks like. You can sure see orbital motion.
Tom, we used for alignment if you haven't figured it out yet.
You're coming in garbled, Wally, So I couldn't hear you.
Guess what constellation we used for the alignment?
Okay. Stand by. We'll get it.
Negative. It was Orion.
Oh, I thought you said Urian.
You're right.
We're switching lenses again, Tom.
Okay.
Okay. It looks like we lost TV, and we've done some spade work down here. Looks like we found out what's wrong with the MARK button.
Very good.
Okay. It looks like there is an improper exit from a program yesterday, and if the IMU's aligned, we'll select program 20. If you got a piece of paper, we'll copy it down.
okay. I'm checking the fuel right now so I'll know how much that cost us. Okay. Ready to copy.
Okay. Go ahead and select program 20. You'll then do VERB 57 ENTER. After that, you will key ENTER, and then you will select program 00. Now what that does is cause a reset of flag word 2 bit 14 which is SET, which has prevented that MARK from getting in.
You broke up after key ENTER, Tom. We have program 20, VERB 57 ENTER, then key in ENTER, then program something.
Then select P00, p-zero-zero.
Hello, Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Tom.
Roger. Did you get That procedure okay?
We copied. It was program 20, VERB 57 ENTER, key in ENTER, then back to P00. That I picked up.
Roger. That should reset that flag word, and you should be all set to use program 51 and 52 as normal.
And again, I can't tell you how good the TV picture looked down here inside the spacecraft. Just beautiful.
Roger. We estimate two cards for later.
Okay. One thing we'd like to talk to you about now is hoy we are going to change the flight plan a little bit.
Go ahead.
Okay. Because of that AC glitch last night and the present status of the RCS fuel, we're going to move the third SPS burn up to today. And we're going to plan to make that burn about 75 hours 48 minutes, so we have about 4 hours to go in which that will bring the perigee on down to 90 miles, and then we'll be way inside the redlane.
Roger. I think that last pass for our last alignment problenis an example of why I didn't want to eat up our fuel earlier of the rather obscure DPO's. The land we saw was an example of why I didn't want to eat up our fuel earlier rather obscure DPO's.
Okay.
This is still the first flight.
Roger.
Tom, when you pass up the total RCS propellant remaining, I would like to get a readout for each quad, also.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. What we'll plan to do is put you the NAV load for this maneuver up over the Canaries, and we'll be passing over that in about another 4 to 5 minutes.
Roger. Standing by.
So if you get a chance, go ahead and select program 00.
We have already tried to work that. It didn't work so we'll go back into P7.
Okay.
