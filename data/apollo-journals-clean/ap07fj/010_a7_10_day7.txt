Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Go ahead.
Apollo 7, Houston. I have your block 16 data, whenever you are ready to copy. [Long pause]
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay, 093 dash 4 A (Able) plus 310 minus 1620 146 plus 58 plus 14 3420, 094 dash 4 Able plus 305 minus 1619 148 plus 34 plus 16 3452, 095 dash 4 Able plus 257 minus 1630 150 plus 09 plus 20 3350, 096 dash 3 Able plus 313 plus 1339 151 plus 25 plus 41 3430, 097 dash 3 Able plus 299 plus 1339 153 plus 01 plus 35 3455, 098 dash 3 Charlie plus 206 plus 1419 154 plus 38 plus 44 3101. End. [Pause]
Roger. Readback follows: 093 dash 4 Able plus 310 plus minus 1620 146 plus 58 plus 14, 3420, 094 dash 4 Able plus 305 minus 1619 148 plus 34 16 3452, 095 dash 4 Able plus 257 minus 1630 150 plus 09 plus 20 3350, 096 dash 3 Able plus 313 plus 1339 151 plus 25 plus 41 3430, 097 dash 3 Able plus 299 plus 1339 153 plus 01 plus 35 3455, 098 dash 3 Charlie plus 206 plus 1419 154 plus 38 plus 44 3101. Over.
Roger. That is correct.
Huntsville AOS.
Huntsville AOS. [Long pause]
Huntsville AOS.
Hey, Jack, do you have much this pass because we're going to be pretty well tied up throwing cameras back and forth. [Pause]
Nothing except the morning news which I can read whenever you are able to ... [Pause]
We'll wait.
Fine.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. Could you tell us which one you will be on when you switch? [Pause]
Able.
Roger. Understand. Able. [Pause]
Roger. We're coming into the eye. [Pause]
Say again, Wally.
We'll catch you near the eye of the hurricane.
Okay. Real fine.
It will be south of us. Man, that's really a spinner. [Pause]
I copy.
It's really a very good definition here. It starts, and you can see the start of it right below us now. We're just going over the begining of it. It's wide open to the west. [Long pause]
It's a very spectacular view. The - there are a lot of broken clouds around the edges of it, but it tightens up in the center. A reel tight vortex and a spotty few high cu - thunderstorms about 100 miles outward - 150 miles off the center. There is a wide blue area, and then it tightens up in the center and reaches a peak just like the thunderstorms we described in South America. [Long pause]
Roger. Copy that. [Pause]
Standby for mark. We are due south. [Long pause]
Stand by.
Mark. [Pause]
Wally, was that the mark right over the eye?
That's affirm. The eye is south of us about - oh, I'd say 200 miles, 150 miles. [Pause]
Okay. [Long pause]
Jack, on that run, we ran the 16 mm movie camera at 1 frame per second for a strip back from the west coast, LA through the hurricane. We ran the Panatomic film with red and green filters from the west coast through El Paso. We ran the S0121 from El Paso through the hurricane, including Houston. The chief landmark tracking on El Paso - I'll have Donn fill you on that. [Long pause]
Okay. Real fine, Wally.
Other than that, we are doing nothing. [Pause]
You should have seen it up here; it looked like squirrels in a cage.
Roger.
Log this, Jack. Frame 142 is where we completed taking pictures of the hurricane at this time. I can't quite read - the MET here at 31, and just prior to that, we took three or four shots of the Houston area, which is wide open, the whole area down there. [Long pause]
Clear Lake stood out like a bell. [Pause]
Okay. Copy that.
Magazine F.
That's been one of our best passes today. [Pause]
It almost made us homesick.
Roger.
We plan to drop in in a few days. [Pause]
Roger. Understand. [Pause]
Jack, I ended doing an unknown landmark. The AUTO optics brought it in the sextant, but it was moving so fast, I got behind it, and never did get a mark on the runway. It was a pistol, though. You really got to get on it in a hurry because it is whistling by, so I ended up taking a little spot out in the desert and did an unknown landmark instead. [Long pause]
Okay. Copy that, Donn. [Pause]
Incidentally, the tracking pass itself, in general, is fairly simple to do if you get on it fast enough. The - I guess the hard part for me is in the procedural aspects of flipping switches and going through the program; meanwhile, the target is whistling by.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. we would like you to switch to the secondary tanks in quad Charlie; give us a mark when you do it. [Long pause]
You want the main OFF first or the secondary on first? [Pause]
Secondary on first.
Roger. Stand by.
MARK.
Charlie on.
Primary Charlie is coming off.
MARK.
Okay. We are about to lose you over Bermuda here; we will pick you up at Ascension at 144 plus 39. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Walt, did you put any high bit rate in the DSE this last rev? [Pause]
That's affirm.
Roger. Copy.
We put it on when Donn was getting his state vector updates in. [Pause]
Okay. [Pause]
Would you like to hear when we have put on? It probably screws up your dump schedule a little bit, doesn't it? [Pause]
I got a nod down here on that question.
Okay. We will try and do that - [Long pause]
And, Walt, on the landmark tracking: about all we need to get is low bit rate. [Pause]
Understand. All you need is low bit rate for the landmark tracking. [Pause]
Okay. And we're going to lose you here Ascension at 144:45.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Honston. We are 1 minute LOS Ascension; Tananarive at 145 plus 01. [Pause]
Roger.
Time - time, 144 hours 58 minutes; just completed landmark tracking on landmark 225. I've got five marks. Four showed up as processed after the marking was done, and all the updates were zeros. The updated landmark coordinates are minus 22879, plus 07227, plus 0015. That's NOUN 89. Correction, Bill, I have - register 3 is plus 00015. Again, the computer chose to update the landmark position rather than its own state vector.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananartve. Standing by. [Long pause]
Got that.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
We got a landmark on that last one and got five good marks on all [garble] updates and put the coordinates of land rate, the update coordinates on the tape. You should get it when it comes down.
It will change them a very slight amount.
It appears we are not updating our own state vector at all. We are merely letting the computer decide where it thinks the landmarks are located.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are close to LOS Tananarive. We'll have ARIA on S-band at 145 plus 12.
Roger.
Ascension, Houston.
[Garble]. How do you read?
This is Houston COMM TECH.
Ascension COMM TECH, Houston COMM TECH, net 1.
I read you 5 by. How me?
Roger, you are loud and clear. Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Roger, thank you.
Okay, CDR 15 clicks on the water gun.
I don't know if it has been reported up here before but I have seen Magellanic clouds on several different occasions at night out here.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
Roger. Honston.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Say again, Jack.
Opposite omni, please.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Carnarvon; we'll pick you up at Guam at 145 plus 28. [Pause]
Roger.
The two stars sighted were Fomalhaut and Diphda, star angle distance 00001, tracking angle minus 00039, plus 00042, minus 00007.
That was at 145:26:30.
Been rolling, been rolling, single CHANNEL ROLL. We counted the pulses. We developed a 2-degree-per-second roll rate, 0.2-degree-per secord roll rate, rolling to the left (laughter). It took seven pulses. It put on a two-tenths of a second, - degree-per-second - roll rate. Seven pulses put out nicely to zero, and in rolling back, it would take eight pulses for 0.2 degree per second.
Apollo 7, Houston through Guam.
Stand by. [Garble] [Pause]
And, 7, we'll have a state vector update to send you over Hawaii. [Pause]
Roger. You mean you don't believe all these good landmarks?
[Garble]. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. I have a PAD on this landmark traking test that you're going to do here over pass begining Hawaii. [Long pause]
Go ahead, partner.
Okay. The first landmark. 10; it's south of ground track 65 miles, GET 145 plus 56, shaft 043, trunnion 34. The weather's clear at this landmark. Second landmark, 142; 18 miles north of ground track, GET 146 plus 17, shaft 327, trunnion 31. Looks like it's about five-tenths covered.
Roger. We just got two this time. Jack?
Affirmative.
I see. I'll try to squeeze in an unknown one in the middle somewhere. [Pause]
Okay. Good. [Long pause]
And, Walt, could we get you to switch the S-band AUX TV switch OFF? [Pause]
That's a good idea. [Long pause]
We pick up Hawaii at 145 plus 21. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
The last of the news that I didn't finish this morning: the National Institute of Health announced today that they have a development of a vaccine to prevent German measles. Tommy Smith won a gold medal in 200-meter dash with a world record time of 19.8. Bob Seagren picked up the United States' sixth gold medal by winning the pole vault, with a world record of 17 feet 8 and 1/2 inches. George Foreman of Houston won a split decision in the opening round of the Olympic boxing.
Sounds like the home team is doing okay down there.
It sure is. [Long pause]
Jack, that hurricane is really a doozy. I haven't seen anithing like that, over. [Pause]
It's moving north, Wally. It should hit the coast of Florida, around Tallahassee. [Pause]
What are the highest winds on the outskirts?
It is quite interesting to see the vortex, it really is pronounced.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Loud and clear.
Roger. We would like to send you a state vector update whenever you're ready. [Pause]
Go, man. [Pause]
Okay. Coming up, 7, and I'm ready to read you the NAV check whenever you are ready to copy. [Long pause]
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. GET 144 plus 50 plus 0000 minus 0936 minus 00891 1013. [Long pause]
Is your update in now?
Affirmative. The update is in. The computer is yours. [Long pause]
Here's your readback, Jack. [Pause]
Go ahead. [Long pause]
Houston, did you copy the readback?
Negative. I didn't copy the readback.
It's on the DSKY.
Roger. [Pause]
Copy the read back.
That's a pretty good readback, hey?
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Jack, frames 143 and 144 are of San Diego. [Pause]
Roger. Copy that.
Loud and clear. There you can see all the way to north Island and MIRAMAR, the whole scene. [Long pause]
And, Wally, I have this sextant star count PAD that I can give you any time. [Pause]
We'll wait till we finish this one landmark here.
Okay. No hurry.
Roger. [Long pause]
Got five marks.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Roger. Are you getting the data off of the computer? [Pause]
Affirmative.
Roger. This is the alternate navigator doing the marking. [Pause]
Roger.
And we again got all zero's on the DELTA-R - DELTA-V updates, and we have some changes to the landmark location on the lat, long, and attitude. It turns out that point is 3600 feet under water. [Long pause]
Okay. Roger. Copy that. [Pause]
We took a sounding. [Pause]
Your weather looks good out on the Gulf. No thunderheads, a little bit of scattered cirrus way south of Beaumont, and that's just about it. [Pause]
Roger.
Nothing west of you. All the way over to Freeport, it's clear as a hell. [Long pause]
Wally, we're trying to save some CAL 25 weather for you. [Pause]
Yes, I would like to get some of that. This isn't bad sailing here. Got a pretty big spinnaker out now.
Thanks for getting that storm out of the way. I appreciate that. [Pause]
Okay. Let me know when you are ready to copy that sextant star count PAD. [Long pause]
And, Wally, something else that you might note here. We didn't copy any indication of a canister change or Of the O2 purge which was about 4 hours ago. [Long pause]
Yes, we've made number 12 canister change and the O2 purge. [Pause]
Okay. I understand they are both complete. [Pause]
Four optical on the O2 purge?
Roger. That was the one at 141:30. [Pause]
We didn't check that off; we owe you that one; the canister was changed. [Pause]
Okay. Copy that.
Roger. We were busy TV-ing it, I think about purge time. [Pause]
Yes, we were on camera then. You know we weren't doing it.
Roger. That is why we thought we would just ask.
Oh, you're sneaky.
Very good.
Now you know why we don't like the TV cameras.
Ready on the update.
Okay. This is star 23, roll 352, pitch 041, yaw 006; star 31, the same roll, pitch, and yaw settings. This will get you within - these stars are within 35 degrees of the sun LOS. [Long pause]
Roger. GET of sighting?
Roger. 147 plus 31. [Pause]
Same number for both of them? [Pause]
Roger. That is the same number for both. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7. [Pause]
Go ahead.
Roger. I was wondering if we could - if we could get an update for these 23 lunar landmark stars business? [Pause]
Okay -
Like some attitude to fly to and the approximate time to do it. I could find it by myself, but it might help a little if we had some ideas as to what - I mean, what roll angle ar pitch angle it will be in. [Pause]
Okay. In work.
Okay.
Jack, frames 145, 146, and 147 were taken at 03 - at 03 minutes. [Long pause]
Houston, do you copy?
Roger. Copy that.
Roger.
Frame 178 taken at 07 30. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
That's on magazine Sierra.
Copy.
Frames 149, 150 taken at 07 35. [Garble] in minutes and seconds. [Long pause]
Copy. [Pause]
We must be doing a bit more tracking today. [Pause]
Say again, Wally.
Did we do perigee?
You are just passing perigee now. [Pause]
Okay. We got a pitch rate change for noting.
Okay. Copy. [Pause]
[Garble] pitched up [garble] degrees local vertical way back up to SCS. [Long pause]
I didn't copy that last, Wally.
That was pitch down 30 degrees, and it came right back up, almost to SCS. I had to stop it. [Pause]
Okay. Copy. [Pause]
We've got an outside station coming in beautifully right now. It seems like every time we come through here. [Pause]
Roger. Understand.
playing "True Love." [Long pause]
Roger. We are stable now right at the perigee attitude. [Pause]
Roger. Copy. We are about 1 minute LOS Antigua; we pick you up over Ascension at 146 plus 19. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Pause]
Roger ...
Roger. Jack, we just had a very anomalous sort of pass here - wrote it in the data off our book [garble] by block 42 [garble] did the marks and the thing came into view about a minute and a half earlier than the time you gave us. It was away off to the north, more than just 18 miles; in fact, they had to yaw 20 degrees to even be able to see it, and anyway, managed finally to get two marks on it before we lost it. They got three new updates for DELTA-R DELTA-V, but they got some huge changes on the landmark coordinates. [Long pause]
Okay. We copied that, Donn. [Pause]
It's conceivable he could have marked on the wrong point, but I don't think he could have been that far off. [Pause]
Okay. We have some information on this P23 Moon star sighting. [Pause]
Okay. Stand by. [Long pause]
FAL Flight, I'm still standing by for your reply. [Long pause]
Attitude? Right. [Long pause]
Roger. Go ahead with your update, Jack.
Okay, Donn. At a GET of 146 plus 00 plus 00, a roll of 347, pitch 097, yaw of 011 should be the landmark line of sight on the moon. [Long pause]
Roger. Stand by, Jack. My pencil crapped out. [Long pause]
Roger. I've got 146 on the hour. Is that right? [Pause]
No, sir. 146 plus 40 plus 00, the roll 347, pitch 097, yaw 011 will put the landmark line of sight on the Moon. [Long pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Go ahead. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston.
Loud and clear.
Roger.
Donn, we got real poor COMM here at Tananarive; like to give you an updated GET for this Moon star sighting of 147 plus 00 plus 00. [Long pause]
[Garble]. Jack. Is that a landmark? [Pause]
Roger. That's P23, Moon star sighting. Time should be 147 plus 00 plus 00. [Long pause]
[Garble] must be a little late on that. [Pause]
Okay.
[Garble] I had about 40 minutes of ATTITUDE HOLD giving.
Roger. Copy.
We're in ATTITUDE right now.
Copy. [Pause]
Hey. Jack. Log another food bag failure - corncrowder today, meal 3 [garble]. [Pause]
Walt, I didn't copy that; COMM is pretty poor here over Tananarive because of the low elevation angle on the antenna. We would like you to switch your TMP power to AUX for this COMM test that we are going to do over Guam. [Long pause]
Roger. When do you want me to switch?
Right now. Walt. [Pause]
Okay. Done.
Roger. [Long pause]
7, we are about 1 minute LOS Tananarive; we have a reak low angle pass at Carnarvon 146 plus 52.
[Garble] butterscotch pudding, but nobody'll take it. Walt and Wally are trying to con me out of my ham and applesauce by offerign me a whole meal for it. [Pause]
It's worth it. Sight unseen, I'll give a whole meal for it.
Walt likes cocoa, so we can palm off the cocoa on him.
I guess I am the only sucker ...
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger.
Roger. We just got you in the middle of your transmision, Donn. Could you say again? [Pause]
Roger. We were just recording some comments on our food up here. [Pause]
Okay.
We were saying that Wally and I were trying to give away our butterscotch pudding, but nobody wants it. Walt likes to collect cocoa, so we can give our cocoa to him, and both of them were trying to con me out of my ham and applesauce. Walt offered me a whole meal for one dish. I guess the message is that we get a little tired off the very rich sweet things, and we still go for the meats and the fruits and the salads. [Long pause]
Okay. Copy that. [Pause]
I tried to call you before over the last station. I had a corn chowder bag failure,the second one Of this type. It failed down where the spout comes out. It's failed down - right down where it goes into the bag itself, and the meal comes out some other hole. [Long pause]
Okay. Copy that.
And it always happens to my favorite food.
Roger. This is about the best COMM we've had. It's an elevation angle less than 1 degree. [Long pause]
That's pretty sensational. [Long pause]
We're 1 minute LOS Carnarvon; we'll pick you up at Guam at 147 plus 01. [Pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston through Guam.
Roger.
Walt, will you turn up your S-band volume? We'll start this COMM load check.
S-band volume up.
Okay. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Houstcm, I'm reading you loud and clear.
You are loud and clear, also. Welt, up over Hawaii, we're going to have a state vector and DAP load update for you - to send you. [Long pause]
Roger. [Pause]
And after the DAP data load, we'd like to get a verification of NOUN 47 and NOUN 48. This is... [Pause]
You'd like verification of what?
NOUN 47 and NOUN 48 in the DAP data load. [Pause]
Roger. Understand. So we'll go to ACCEPT on your call over Hawaii. [Pause]
Okay. Real fine.
Walt, if you're ready, I can give you the NAV check for this update over Hawaii - I can give it to you now. [Long pause]
We'll pick it up at Hawaii while you are uplinking us.
Okay. No problem. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7. [Pause]
Go ahead, Apollo 7.
Donn,'s turning his S-band up. Ne wants to give you his data. [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead.
Roger. I don't know if you read this on the computer. I've got P23 up, and I've got Alphard placed on landmark on the Moon, and these are the shaft and trunnion angles. Do you read them down there? [Long pause]
Roger. I'm copying them.
Okay. I'll tell you that was one whale of a lot easier than that crazy Earth horizon business. [Long pause]
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Guam; Hawaii at 147 plus 16.
Day 7, meal B, we ...
... are we going to review the next one?
... corn chowder food bag failed where the drinking spout goes into the bag. It pulled apart down - it was not an external leak. It was internal, it was where the drinking spout is scored. That's a similar failure to an earlier chocolate pudding bag failure. That's the third food bag failure that the LMP has sustained.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Five-by.
Okay. If you will go to ACCEPT, we will send you a NAV load and then a DAP update. [Long pause]
Houston, can we wait on this pass? We've got a DTO going here, and we need the computer for it. [Pause]
Okay. That is fine.
I'll take the PAD for the NAV check.
Okay. GET 154 plus 30 plus 0000 plus 1486 plus 03724 1368. [Long pause]
Roger. Jack, we will take your update. We are in ACCEPT. [Pause]
Okay. Coming up.
Okay. Readback follows: 154 30 four balls plus 1486 plus 03274 1438. Over. [Pause]
Negative on the last one, Walt: 1368. [Pause]
1368. Sorry. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. Wally, we are gradually picking up an increase in CO2 there. You may have gotten a bad canister at that last change. [Pause]
Roger. See on this particular test here, by the way, this very brilliant star count test has us right up in the perigee torque area. We are going to really hose the fuel out. [Long pause]
Okay. Copy that.
Now this one is on the experimenters, too. We are going to have some right interesting comments to make about celestial navigation when we get back. [Long pause]
There are going to be lot of people who are going to be interested. [Pause]
Hey, Jack, we are like reading 1 mm; shouldn't we go ahead, let this thing hang in here until it gets up close to 76? [Pause]
Roger. We are just trying to give you a little bit of a hack ahead of time, so you will know what to look for. [Pause]
Well, our criteria is 76, so we have not been concerned. It's just turned out to be the first one we've ever seen over one, that's all. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
May we have the computer?
Roger. 7, we would like to verify the DAP data load. Not at this tame, but some time later on. We would just like a verification on NOUN 47 and 47 in the DAP data load prior to tomorrow's burn. The computer is yours at this time.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, Apollo 7.
Roger. NOUN 47 plus two balls 164 plus - [Long pause]
Did you read?
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Jack, did you read NOUN 47?
Negative. Walt, you got it just as we were handing over stations here. Could you say it again? [Pause]
Can you read our DSKY? Can you read out DSKY, Jack? [Pause]
Negative right now, Walt.
Okay. NOUN 47 pllus two balls 164 plus two balls 551 plus 29560. NOUN 48 minus three balls 76 minus three balls 47 plus 02110. Over. [Long pause]
Okay. We copy that. Could you place your PMP power to NORMAL? [Pause]
It's in NORMAL.
Copy. [Pause]
Hey, Jack, somebody might write down and leave it on my desk for when I get back how many different COMM modes they've checked out on this flight. [Pause]
Okay. We'll get it to you.
Hey, Jack, do you have time for a map update? [Pause]
Map update in work. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. And I have your map update. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. I have your map update.
Go, Jack.
Roger. REV 93, time of the node 146 plus 58 plus 58, longitude 122.4 east. [Long pause]
We are about 1 minute LOS. We'll pick you up at Tananarive at about 148 plus 09.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. [Pause]
Roger. Jack, read you loud and clear.
Wally, I would like to ask you if you powered down? [Pause]
Affirmative.
Okay. Thank you.
Find our suit - heat rate must have peaked about - a suit temperature of about 64 degrees just before power down - and held there for a while after power down. Assuming that it will improve with power up plus holding real great for 4 to 5 minutes, and then it's pretty hot. We felt the heat very easily. Read that? [Long pause]
Roger. You were a little bit garbled, but I think we've got most of it. [Pause]
Okay. On the star check: only the two stars called up by the program were seen, no others with the sextant. [Long pause]
Roger. Understand.
And today will be very busy, and tomorrow, we have the big burn - burn 5. [Pause]
Go ahead.
We are deleting the TV pass tomorrow. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. We copy that. We are digesting that, Wally. [Pause]
Say again.
We copy that.
Okay, we were moving along like mad today.
[Garble] back today, and it looked awful [garble] I didn't want to do it before our first burn, but it can foul up our time lines considerably. [Long pause]
Roger. Copy.
Roger. [Pause]
That's about all I have for you. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Wally, is the suit temperature or cabin temperature getting a little more comfortable now that you have powered down? [Pause]
That's affirm. I should have told you: we are down to about 58 degrees right now. [Pause]
Okay. copy.
We're doing fine. [Long pause]
Jack, in your planning for subsequent maneuvers, you should try to avoid being out at SCS or PVS at more than 20 degrees as you pass through perigee. Over. [Long pause]
Okay. I copied that, Wally.
Roger. You're going to have to save that - [Long pause]
[Garble] that burn 4. On burn 5 we better ease up a little bit on ...
[Garble] the fuel and the attitude. [Pause]
Okay. Understand. We are getting pretty close to LOS Tananarive; we will pick you up at Guam at 148 plus 36. [Pause]
Roger.
And Mercury at 148 plus 33.
Apollo 7, Houston through the Mercury. [Pause]
Roger. Read you loud and clear. [Pause]
Roger. Read you also. [Pause]
[Garble] about 25 minutes [garble]. [Long pause]
Hey, Jack.
Go ahead, Wally.
Okay. I guess we'll chlorinate water tonight, about 149:50. [Pause]
Okay. Wally, you're about two-by here; you're pretty garbled. We might have a little better luck over Guam, which is coming up here. [Pause]
Okay. We will chlorinate water today. [Long pause]
Okay. We understand.
[Garble] down about 52 [garble].
Houston, Apollo 7.
Hello, Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read?
Roger. Go ahead, Apollo 7.
Have you had a chance to work up our fuel status after today's operations? [Pause]
Okay. Understand you want to get a present fuel status - fuel status now? [Pause]
That's affirm; any time.
Okay. We are summarizing that now; we'll probably have it up to you over Hawaii. [Pause]
Very good. [Long pause]
Apollo 7. Your fuel number for your onboard chart is 666. [Pause]
Roger. Readback: 666.
Apollo 7. Houston. One minute LOS Guam; Hawaii at 147 plus 51. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7. Houston through Hawaii.
Loud and clear.
Okay. Walt, I've got a little message for you here. [Pause]
Walt's off COMM right now. Do you want me to rely, or should I get him up? [Pause]
Okay. Wally, are you in the right seat? [Pause]
Say again.
Can you get in the right seat to do some readings of a couple of gages here? [Pause]
Stand by. [Long pause]
Go ahead.
Okay. Wally, prior to this O2 fan tank - O2 tank 2 fan cycle that we are going to give you here, we would like to read out phase A, B, and C on AC bus 2. [Long pause]
Roger. Phase A is 150.5, B 115.5, and C 115. [Long pause]
Okay. Now, Wally, we would like to turn O2 fans tank 2 ON now, and then read out A, B, and C again. [Pause]
Got the fans tank 2 ON now. Phase A is - went up just a smidgen - 116, B is about 115.7, and C is still 115. [Long pause]
Okay. Wally, after 3 minutes of fan ON, we would like to have you be reading AC 2 phase B when you turn the fans OFF. [Long pause]
Prior to, or subsequent?
Right during the switch operation, when you turn the fans in tank 2 OFF, be reading phase B. [Pause]
Okay. I'd say that's a pretty good job of sacking out that AC 1, AC 2 problem, anyway. [Long pause]
I didn't copy that, Wally.
That's a good job down there of sacking out that AC bus 1, AC bus 2 problem. [Pause]
Roger. Thank you.
I was kind of a crank when it first happened.
I don't blame you a bit.
I like to feel direct - direct coming home.
Hey, Jack, you with me?
Roger, Wally. Go ahead.
Would you ask someone in the support room how many frames per foot there are in the 16mm camera? [Pause]
Okay. We'll get it.
Thank you. [Long pause]
Hey, Jack, do you read?
Go ahead.
Okay. We just ran the switch valve test, and Walt looked at the phasing light on the switch; it dropped a smidgen - may be a quarter of a volt to half a volt. [Long pause]
Okay. Thank you very much, Wally. I have some RCS redline data for you. [Pause]
Stand by. [Pause]
Go ahead.
Okay. For service module - for an SCS service module RCS deorbit, the value is 581. [Long pause]
Roger.
Okay. For adapt RCS deorbit, the value is 520; and the value for hybrid deorbit, the value is 223. [Long pause]
Roger.
Okay. We show quad A is just a smidgen under the SCS redline but has ample margin for adapt deorbit. [Long pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Jack, on these landmark sightings that you call up to us for targets of opportunity... [Pause]
Roger.
... if you all could keep book on that - we missed Luzon this last pass; we might have had a whack at it. It's kind of hard to remember all those [garble]. [Long pause]
Okay. You are a little bit hard to read. We'll pick it up on the recorder here. [Pause]
On the landmark passes?
Yes. Go ahead.
If you can give us the time when they come up, whenver, that helps us quite a bit because we can write it on the flight plan. [Pause]
Okay. Real fine. After we hand over to Huntsville - to - we get through to Huntsville here, we are going to hand over to ARIA so you might turn up your S-band volume. In a couple of minutes, we'll have ARIA coverage on S-band for about another 4 or 5 minutes. [Long pause]
Very good. That was a good watch today, Jack. [Pause]
It's been a good day; we've done a lot. [Pause]
We sure did. [Pause]
We're looking forward to tomorrow.
Real fine. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. Wally, on that question that you asked: the 16 camera frame, there are 40 frames per foot of film. [Long pause]
How many feet do we have in each magazine? [Pause]
I didn't copy that last little, Wally. [Pause]
How much footage do we have in the magazine? [Pause]
Okay. Standby. [Long pause]
Wally, there are 130 feet per magazine. [Pause]
Roger. Thank you, Jack.
ARIA 3, go REMOTE. [Pause]
REMOTE. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA. [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7. Standing by. [Pause]
Houston standing by also.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS ARIA; pick you up at Tananarive at 149 plus 42. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Roger, Ron. Nice of you to get up and get to work.
How do you read?
Apollo 7, Houston, Tananarive. Standing by.
Good evening, Ron.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS; Mercury at 06. [Pause]
Roger. We read you. [Pause]
Roger. I read you that time.
Good evening, Ron.
Apollo 7, Houston. Standing by. [Pause]
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger. Same. [Pause]
Donn Eisele wants 20 clicks of water logged and two aspirin. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Hey, Ron, log the LMP with 15 clicks of water. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
How's it going down there?
Real fine; beautiful day down here today.
We got some beautiful pictures of it.
Very good. [Pause]
You guys getting tired of this long flight or anything? [Pause]
No, not realy. I'd like to be there with you.
We got room.
Good.
That hurricane was realy something to see. It stood out very clearly today. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go.
Hoger. We concur on negative TV tmorrow.
Very good. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Looks like pins have come undone again on LMP's BIOMED harness somewhere in there. [Pause]
Okay. Roger. We'll get it glued together.
Roger.
Okay. Ron, I'll get on it. The reason for that is because I've got kind of a spider's web of leads down here. Even after they made this harness over, I've got about 6 inches extra on one lead, and a couple others are apparently pretty tight, I guess. [Long pause]
Roger. I understand. [Pause]
But I've got this ground wire on, so whatever you do comes through good, doesn't it? [Long pause]
It was real good for a long time there, Walt; then last night, we noticed that it looked like maybe the ground lead was possibly coming partially loose or something like that. [Long pause]
The sensor, that is.
Okay. I'll take a look at it. [Long pause]
I've got a one-line update to your targets of opportunity for two balls 5; that's two balls 5. [Pause]
Go.
Roger. It's the area north of the Colorado River. [Pause]
North of the Colorado River? Seriously? [Pause]
Roger. Evidently it must be in the mountains up in there cause the river runs - [Pause]
Colorado River runs north and south. That sounds like Alaska. [Pause]
Me, too. [Long pause]
Ron, we're trying to figure out, just for the fun of it, what does burn 5 do to our inclination? Does anybody have a story on that handy? It's no big deal, just curious. [Pause]
Roger. Will check into it; I've got the - [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Long pause]
Ron, while I'm looking at it, do you have any typhoons in the Far East, or [garble] in the Phillipines? [Long pause]
I'll check on it. I don't recall seeing any on the map there this evening. [Pause]
Hawaii and Australua, wooly woolies? [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. About 1 minute to LOS.
Roger.
Now, your preburn inclination is 31.22 and postburn 30.08; GETI will be about 165 plus 00. [Long pause]
We thought we'd drive it in a little bit. Okay. [Pause]
And DELTA-V 1646, burn about a minute and 6 seconds. [Long pause]
Roger. [Pause]
North of the Colorado River we won't get to for awhile.
Yes. That's right.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. [Pause]
Roger.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Same. [Pause]
You're right. Tropical Storm Gloria is due east of Luzon about this tine, so you probably saw it when you were going by there. [Pause]
Roger. That's what we call a [garble], right? [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
That's two for Apollo 7 now, isn't it? [Pause]
That's correct. [Pause]
7, Houston. We've got a new update on the amount of film in your magazines. [Pause]
You have 80 feet in 16 mm, magazines. [Pause]
Fabulous. Oh, 80 feet rather than 130; that's not fabulous. Okay. [Pause]
Yes, that's right.
Okay. I'll have to do my arithmetic over again then. I guess you can save us by telling us how long we can run it, 1 frame, 6 frames, and 16. [Long pause]
Roger. I'll get that information.
Okay. [Pause]
We mapped the whole southwest corner of the United States with 1 frame a second on an 18 mm lens today. [Pause]
Okay.
That was from - oh, just west of San Diego all the way throuh to the hurricane on into Florida. [Long pause]
Roger.
That was done on S0368 movie in ease anybody gets excited. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Wallv, you might be interested; they're not even waiting for you to get back. We're using the third deck there for sumulations tonight for the next mission. [Long pause]
I'm sorry I missed that.
Roger. We're using - they're simulating the next mission upstairs tonight. [Pause]
Very good. Tell them to take better food along with them.
Okay. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. I have your film run times, there. [Pause]
Say again, Ron?
Roger. I have your film run time, your 16 mm run times. [Pause]
Okay.
At 1 frame, in 53 minutes 20 seconds. [Pause]
At 6 frames, it's 8 minutes 52 seconds; at 16, it's 3 plus 20. [Long pause]
Thank you. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. S-band volume up at 35 plus 30 for ARIA. [Long pause]
Roger. 35:30. [Long pause]
Ron, frame 152 on the Sierra mag was on the big island of Hawaii. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Huntsville AOS.
ARIA 3, go REMOTE.
ARIA 3, clear and loud. GO REMOTE. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 3 S-band. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA. 0ver. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, S-band up, please.
Apollo 7, [garble]. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. You broke up that time; say again. [Pause]
Roger, if you turn that S-band up, and we were a little behind.
Roger. [Garble] S-band up [garble] or not [garble]. [Pause]
Roger. You're still breaking up.
Roger. Hear you very weak. [Pause]
Roger. COMM's not too good this time.
Okay.
[Garble] real higg squall in the background. [Pause]
Roger. I copied that.
Apollo 7, Houston. You should be closer to ARIA now. Is the voice any better? [Long pause]
Say again, Ron. [Pause]
Still not much better. You're still breaking up, and I must be coming through quite weak still. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. One minutes LOS; Tananarive at 17.
150 hours 55 minutes and 10 seconds into the flight; magazine F, frame 153: it's just south of [garble] and [garble] in the area of Chile.

Frames 154 and 155 of Japan. [Pause]
Roger. Copy. [Pause]
On magazine Sierra.
Roger. [Pause]
7, Houston. If you've attempted BIOMED fix, we still have no joy. [Pause]
Hey, Ron, I went ahead and checked all these things. They're all made up, and I don't think there's athing else I can do, but I'll check them again when I go to bed in a little bit, but they look to me like every thing's okay.
Okay. We might have an internal break or something in one of the wires, and we'll work on it later; no sweat. [Long pause]
Along the peak of Mount Fujiyama, there's snow on the top. [Long pause]
Say again.
Frame 155 of Mount Fujiyama. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. [Pause]
Roger. Could you give me a readout of our O2 manifold pressure? [Pause]
Roger. We're standing by for lock-up - don't have it yet. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We're reading 104 now. [Pause]
Roger. [Garble] 103. [Pause]
Roger. 103. [Pause]
Roger.
Hey, Ron, the redundant component check is GO. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
7, Houston. Sometime when you get a chance there, we could use more or less a taste versus time summary on your water. [Long pause]
Say again?
Roger. We coluld use a kind of a taste versus time from chlorination on the potable water. [Pause]
Well, now you've brought the subject up - you Want to talk to him? [Pause]
We just put the chlorine in about 15 minutes ago, just before your pass. We are a little concerned about the rate to put it in. It's a rather brown-looking goopy thing at the base of the chlorine injector, and I'm not sure - rust or what - but I'm not sure that I'm happy with it at this time. [Long pause]
Roger. Houston. You went through a keyhole there, and we're still in one, really. At the base of what? And - [Long pause]
If I had that on my water faucet, I'd clean it off or get a new faucet. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
If I had it in my swimming pool, I'd call for pool service. [Long pause]
About 30 seconds LOS; Redstone at 46. [Pause]
Roger.
Belay that Red - Redstone at 14. [Pause]
Roger. 14.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. Standing by. [Pause]
Roger.
Roger. Loud and clear.
[Garble] just off Hawaii, we saw a big smoke trail [garble]. [Long pause]
7, Houston. Say it again.
We saw the smoke trail of a ship at about 07:45 GETI. [Pause]
Roger.
Seven minutes 45 seconds. Make Gordo Cooper happy to tell him that one. [Pause]
It sure will.
We haven't seen any smoke counts up in the Himalayas, and now it's night, so I guess we're loosers on that one. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Haven't seen any trucks of the Imperial Valley yet, either. [Pause]
Okay.
We'll look for water skiers on Taylor Lake this weekend. [Pause]
Very good.
7, Houston. About 30 seconds LOS. Walt, you might be advised it's the sternal connectors on the BIOMED that seem to be acting up. [Pause]
Did you say the sternal connectors?
Affirmative.
Okay. I'll check it over good before I go to bed.
Roger.
We'll have all of that just to [garble]. [Long pause]
I took care of my stern problem. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Roger. Thank you.
Roger. Loud and clear. [Pause]
Anithing more on the news down there, Ron? [Pause]
Roger. We're working on some.
Okay. Anybody have the Lima Sierra update? [Pause]
Roger. Your hydrogen margin is 2.6 pounds now; your O2 margin is 58 pounds; Lima Sierra 073/061, Sierra Foxtrot 075, Echo Kilo plus 003. [Long pause]
Roger. Thank you. [Long pause]
The Olympics are getting started tonight sometime; we don't have any information coming in on that yet. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Hey, Ron. How are the surgeons doing on curing colds for long range tonight? [Pause]
They're still working on it. Some guy down here is also working - facetiously, that is - to determine if you would have gotten a cold had you not been flown. [Long pause]
Had we not what?
Had you not taken the flight.
Roger. That's very significant. [Pause]
I don't know how he's gointg to do it, but he's working on it.
It could prove to be invaluable data.
I wonder what would have happened if our fathers hadn't met our mothers!
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. Opposite omni. [Pause]
Roger. Stand by. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. I have a one-line flight plan update. [Pause]
Wait one. [Pause]
The only thing we have to look forward to is China and Japan, so you won't have to write. [Pause]
Okay. Go, Ron.
Okay. It's at 154 plus 00, a fuel cell O2 purge. This is a little early, but it allows us to get another one in just prior to the burn. [Long pause]
Roger. Hey, Ron, tell the doctors not to worry about the cold. I always understood that it takes a week to get rid of it if you treat it and 7 days if you don't. Tomorrow's our eighth day, so it'll probably be gone. [Long pause]
Roger. [Pause]
The doctor really confirms that. [Long pause]
Houston. To verify up telemetry MANNED TO NORMAL. [Pause]
Always. [Pause]
Roger.
By the way, the guy I was talking about before on the colds: I just heard that over the news. It's not one of our guys. [Pause]
Oh, that's encouraging anyway.
Roger. [Pause]
Thank God we're not paying that cat.
Concur. [Long pause]
We have a little information here if you are concerned about maybe the drop in batter voltages that we were ... [Pause]
Go ahead.
Roger. Looks like it's a nominal-type thing. This downward shift corresponds to a nominal transition from the test to the plateau. [Garble] and it's ... [Long pause]
Roger.
...It normally happens just about where we have now, 8 to 14 amp-hours discharge out of the battery. And we're predicting an end-of mission voltage on batt A and B of 30 to 31 volts. [Long pause]
Roger. Right now, we are looking at Fujisan. [Pause]
Roger. Lot of snow? [Pause]
The usual white peak. [Pause]
Ron, how about someone marking our position now, and let us know how far away we were from Fuji? [Pause]
Willco. [Pause]
One fifty nine and 160 - 159 at Shikoku and 160 long shot - at Fujisan. [Pause]
Roger.
Hey, Ron, are you still with us?
A triangular island in the Pacific; at 153 hours 25 minutes and 12 seconds, we were almost directly over it; frame 161, magazine S.
153 hours 25 minutes and 12 seconds; we were almost directly over a triangular island in the Pacific, frame number 161, magazine S.

Apollo 7, Houston. The United States beat Yugoslavia in basketball today 73 to 58. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Row, you might be interested that the stock market is fired by rumors of a possible halt in the bcmbing of North Vier Nam, bounded ahead today in third highest volume in the exchange history. The volume of 21.06 million; Dow Jones was up 3.60 at 958.91. [Long pause]
Roger. That's the highest on record, isn't it? [Pause]
Not quite sure. I don't think so. [Pause]
It looks like Hurricane Gladis is expected to go ashore in a relatively sparsely populated area of Florida. [Long pause]
That's fortunate. [Pause]
It was also announced today that Mrs. John F. Kennedy will marry shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis. [Pause]
Oh. my! [Long pause]
Walt, I have your present battery ampere-hours if you have a minute. [Pause]
Roger. Go ahead with it.
Roger. A 30.8, B 28.4, and C is 39.0. [Long pause]
Roger. Thank you. [Long pause]
AOS Ascension at 12.
Thanks for the news, Ron.
[Garble] Jack.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. Standing by. [Pause]
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Good morning.
How are you?
Good shape.
I'd like to log in two aspirin and 15 clicks of water each for the commander and the LM pilot. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Pause]
Roger.

Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. Standing by. [Pause]
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Ron, this Donn. I'd like to register a strong complaint on the lithium hydroxide storage cans on the floor. That - A2, I believe is the number - they're the ones that are under Wally's couch. They're an old type of box left over from Block I. And the lids: it takes a tremendous amount of force to make them close. They're just not suitable at all. [Long pause]
Roger. I understand.
The new type ones with the rounded corners and the new latches are great, and they came in [garble]. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Apollo 7, Houston. Request you turn O2 tank 2 fan on for 5 minutes then off. [Long pause]
Roger. O2 going on. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS; Ascension 20. [Long pause]
Apollo 7. Roger.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. [Pause]
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Loud and clear. Donn, we would like to get a rundown on your health status: medication, sleep, and what have you. [Pause]
Say again.
Roger. Just a little resume of your status: cold, medication, sleep. [Pause]
Roger. I got about 5 hours sleep last night which seems like enough. I'm not a bit tired. We still have head colds. My ears are starting to clear up somewhat, but I still got pretty stuffy sinuses. Wally and Walt are still complaining of stopped-up ears and head. [Long pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
And we're assuming no medication on your part other than reported aspirin. [Pause]
That's correct. We decided to save the Actifed till the last day or so. [Pause]
Roger. Another thing for our future flight planing here on your procedures book in the control modes, if you could somehow give us a rundown: either number them down the page or some thing like that, and give me the numbers you have not completed, so we can kind of plan maybe on RCS fuel. [Long pause]
Okay, Ron. I'll do that a little later. I'm trying to eat my breakfast right now. [Pause]
Roger. No hurry.
Yes, I think we've covered most of them, one way or another. [Pause]
Roger.
I don't know whether, or you know how much data got down on the ball, but I think we have been in just about every control mode. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
You haven't had any PT for breakfast yet, have you? [Long pause]
Yes, I've got a little bit right here, right now.
Roger.
[Garble] anyway. You talking about fortified Tang? [Long pause]
Something like that. [Long pause]

Houston, go. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Say again. [Pause]
Oh, it was nothing. I was just acknowledging.
Oh, Roger. Sorry. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We've lost your BIOMED now. [Pause]
Roger. BIOMED was disconnected temporarily. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Verify O2 tank 2 fan OFF.
Roger, it's OFF.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. Standing by. [Pause]
Roger, Houston. [Pause]
Roger. You're loud and clear. [Long pause]
Say, Donn, we've got some more gold medal winers. [Pause]
Great, who are they? [Pause]
Roger. In swimming, the USA set a new record in the men's 400-meter free style relay in 331.7. Also the US women won the 400-meter medley relay in 428.3. That gives us a total of 17 gold medal so far. [Long pause]
Sounds pretty good.
Great. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Pause]
Roger.
7, Houston. We plan to run through program 5 over Redstone and power down again. Over the Canaries this pass. [Long pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. You ought to be right over typhon Gloria at this time. [Pause]
Okay. Thank you. I was looking for it. [Long pause]
I think I see it, Ron. It's just a big mass of white clouds directly beneath me, but I can't get a shot at it. We are not at the right angle. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Couldn't discern a particular pattern like we could on Hurricane Gladys. Where is Gladys now anyway? [Pause]
It's just about to hit the Florida coast down there kind of west of Tallahassee, I think. [Pause]
Oh.
Apollo 7, Houston. About 1 minute LOS; Redstone at 54. [Pause]
Okay.
Hey, Donn, just out of curiosity, were you testing the tissues between Redstone and Ascension on the last pass? [Pause]
Was I testing what?
The tissues.
Oh, tissues. No, I was taking a bath, as a matter of fact. [Pause]
Okay. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Houston, go.
Roger. Would like to advise that the tissues have been tested with a reasonable degree of success. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. [Pause]
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're ready for GNC power up. [Pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. Is the urine dump heater still in main A, and have you been cycling it at all? [Long pause]
Roger. It's in main A; we haven't touched it that I know of since we took off. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. LOS. Canaries at 25. [Pause]
Roger, Ron.
Apollo 7, Houston through Canaries. Standing by.
Apollo 7, Houston at Canary. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
Say again,
Roger. Apollo 7, Houston. We'll go CMC power down. [Pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS; Redstone at 28, and you're in your one-hundredth rev. [Long pause]
Oh. Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. [Long pause]
Roger, Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Roger. Go ahead, Bill.
Hello, Donn. I thought maybe you weren't reading me. I have a flight plan update when you're ready to copy. [Pause]
Okay. stand by. [Long pause]
Go ahead, Bill. [Pause]
Roger. If you'll look at page 2 dash 54, at 160 hours plus 25, delete the fuel cell purge. [Long pause]
Roger.
At 161 plus 10, DAP update. [Long pause]
Okay.
162 plus 30, waste water dump. At 163 plus 40, fuell cell O2 purge. [Long pause]
Roger. Fuel cell O2 purge at 163 plus 40. [Pause]
Affirmative. And if you'll look on the next page 2 dash 55, I have a few items there relative to the burn. [Pause]
Okay. Go ahead.
Right. The nominal time now for burn 5 is 165 hours even. It'll be quads Bravo and Delta for the two-jet ullage, MTVC for the last 30 seconds; the burn time will be 66 seconds, and you can delete the reference to battery charging there. [Long pause]
Okay. Got quads B and D, 165 on the hour, two-jet ullage, and the burn time is 1 minute and 6 seconds. Is that right? [Pause]
Affirmative. And delete the reference to battery charging. [Long pause]
Okay. Guess the DELTA-V changed some then, too, didn't it? [Pause]
We'll be updating that, and also ... okay ... [Pause]
Okay.
... the MTVC's for the last 30 seconds. [Pause]
All right. [Pause]
Okay. That does it. [Pause]
Okay. [Long pause]
Donn, just for your information, the total DELTA-V for that burn is 16 46. It'll be on the PAD when we send it up. [Long pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Redstone; Antigua at 49. [Pause]
Roger. Antigua at 49.
Apollo 7, Houston through Antigua.
Roger, Houston. Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston through Canary.
Apollo 7, Houston through Canary.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Roger. Go.
Roger. Just checking. Now, it's going to be about an hour here. See - [Pause]
Say again, Bill. [Pause]
Roger. It's going to be about 45 minutes before next acquisition. I just wanted to get a call from you before we had LOS here at Canary. [Pause]
Yes. Okay. Fine. Everything's here fine [Pause]
Good. Thank you. [Pause]
I've got two sleeping beauties and a sound ship.
Roger. Donn, how was your sleep last night? [Long pause]
Oh, it was pretty good. Not quite as good as the night before. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
We have estimated acquisition Honysuckle at 43. We'll need the S-band volume up, however; it's sort of a fringe pass. [Long pause]
Roger.
If we don't get you there, we'll get you at the Redstone on the hour, and that will be an hour from now. [Pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston through Honeysuckle. Poor contact.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. [Pause]
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7. [Pause]
Say, Donn, this waste water quantity is getting up pretty high, and we've been taking a look at this; it probably would be a good idea perhaps to dump this stuff before you do any NAV sighting, well before. [Long pause]
Yes, that's a good idea. Thanks, Bill. [Pause]
And go ahead and do it anytime, I suppose.
Alright.
Also, when I was updating the flight plan - if you have it there, you'll notice there's still an "H2 heaters an" at 160 hours and 5 minutes and, of course, I should have had that deleted. [Long pause]
Roger. I got that.
And, one additional item to catch up on, and that's this fuel cell O2 purge at 163 40. This should be done after the DELTA-V bias test. [Long pause]
Oh, okay. [Pause]
Thank you. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Pause]
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go.
Roger. I was just looking ahead. This passive thermal control DTO - [Pause]
Roger.
I'm wondering - if we follow the procedure that's outlined, if we're not going to put ourselves in that undesirable situation where we're pointed straight up, or nearly so, in the lower part of our trajectory - and I'm wondering if it might not be better to simply specify the time in which they want the roll rate - you know, with the three disks to begin - and let us simply get them a few minutes ahead and then C spelling pitch and yaw at the designated time. [Long pause]
Okay. Donn, stand by, and we'll bet that -
- their tight net band for - oh, about 20 minutes before we disable pitch and yaw, and our experience so far indicates that we can do a better job mannually in pulse of nulling these pitch and yaw rates anyway. [Long pause]
Roger. We've copied that, and we'll take a good look at that. [Pause]
Okay. I'm afraid if we do it the way it's outlined, it may cost us a fair amount of fuel, and it may screw up the test as well. [Long pause]
Roger.
Donn, your waste water quantity right now is reading 88 percent. [Pause]
Roger. Bill, I think I'll go ahead and dump it now.
Right. Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Redstone; Antigua at 20. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Antigua. [Long pause]
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Houston, log the CMP 12 clicks on the water gun. [Pause]
Say again the number.
Twelve.
Roger. Twelve. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Roger. [Long pause]
Donn, we show you down about 53 percent on the waste water, and just bring her right on down to 25 percent. [Pause]
Okay. Fine. Help me keep an eye on it. Bill, I think I'm going to power up the CMC, the IMU, and everything prior to the next night pass. I was looking ahead here; the burn time now occurs during the night pass which effectively wipes it out as trying to do an alignment, so I'm going to have to start a little early. [Long pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. We will need to send you an update over Carnarvon or Honeysuckle, and that's at about 16 plus 20 nominally, maybe 161 10. [Long pause]
Okay. I'll go ahead and power up everything at 161. [Long pause]
Okay.
Houston, Apollo -
Apollo 7, Houstoa. Go.
Roger. Could you give me a map update, please?
Roger. Stand by. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Map update for REV 101: GET 158 plus 48 plus 46, node at 59.3 west, 59.3 west. [Long pause]
Roger. Thank you.
And we're coming up on LOS Antigua. We'll pick you up at Canaries in about 3 minutes. [Pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston through Canary. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Roger.
All right, Donn. I'll be giving you a DAP or send - yes, giving you a DAP PAD and also a maneuver PAD at Carnarvon. That will be about 161 plus 10, and I'll have a P27 PAD standing by. Having a little trouble with our uplink at Carnarvon, but that's what we'll be doing when we come up on Australia. [Long pause]
Okay. I want to try and get a few pictures across there, too. [Pause]
Okay. [Long pause]
Hey, Donn, are you exercising? [Pause]
No, I'm soaking up the water that leaks around the [garble] when we dump over it. [Pause]
Okay. That answers the question. Our friendly doctor noticed thAt you must be scurrying around there. [Long pause]
Yes, I am. Every time we dump waste water, we get a big bBlob of water that leaks out around this fitting we've put on. [Long pause]
Yes.
[Garble] without stripping the threads. I think the problem is that there is no gasket or washer in it. [Pause]
Yes. Must be quite a nuisance. [Pause]
Yes. At least, we don't have to do it very often.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Canaries. I'm going to give you a call in a couple of minutes at AOS Madrid just to check the S-band, so we need the volume up. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. S-band volume up.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. I have a DAP data update and also a maneuver PAD, and if you'll go to P00 and ACCEPT, we'll send up your new state vector. [Long pause]
Roger. Going to ACCEPT. [Pause]
Okay. Now, Donn, I have the DAP data update. Of course it is brief, and the maneuver PAD will take a little while. You mentioned that you wanted to get some pictures over Australia so - sort of - you might take a look at that and either delay your readback or ask me to delay sending it to you. [Long pause]
All right, Bill.
Ready to copy?
All right. I get you. Why don't you give me the DAP data?
Okay. DAP data: minus 00078 Anus 0049 plus 02142. Read back. [Long pause]
Minus three balls 78 minus two ball 49 plus 02142. [Pause]
Readback is correct. I'm ready to give you the maneuver PAD when you're ready. [Pause]
I think I'll hold up here and get some pictures. [Pause]
Okay. Just let me know when you are ready to copy; and if we run to LOS of Carnarvon, be sure to turn your volume up before Honeysuckle. We'll have Honeysuckle acquisition at about 15. [Long pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. No need to acknowlege right now, but you've got a GO for a 121 dash 1. [Pause]
Roger. Thank you. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. You might check Your attitude right now. [Pause]
Okay. Roger.
And we're coming up on LOS Carnarvon in about 45 seconds; S-band volume up at 15. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through Honeysuckle. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through Honeysuckle. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. How do you read, Donn?
Loud and clear.
Okay. Let me know when you're ready to copy the maneuver PAD. And, also, with the previous DAP data update, that was for NOUN 48. [Long pause]
Rotger. Understand.
And let me know when you're ready to copy the maneuver PAD. [Pause]
Okay. You can go ahead now. [Pause]
Roger. And before I start, your state vector and target loads are in. Starting to read for SPS 5 slash PUGS, 16500 0000 plus 01110 plus 16300 plus 02034 2406 plus 0898 17280 29494 minus 078 minus 049 106 34 3548 201 164 18 0000 minus 3062 plus 11248 1239 000 000 000. Standing by for resdback.
Roger. SPS 5 slash PUGS 16500 0000 plus 01110 plus 16300 plus 02034 2406 plus 0898 17280 29494 minus 078 minus 049 106 34 3548 201 164 18 0000 minus 3062 plus 11248 1239, and all balls for attitude.
Ro6er. And for the attitude, it's out of plane, south, heads up. The NAV check - stand by - comments: MTVC takeover at TIG plus 36 seconds. Additional commments: manual cut-off at DELTA-V counter equal 100 feet per second, sextant star not visible after 164 plus 41. Also, if needed, your R, P, and Y align 171, 260, 014.
Say, I ran out of room to write. What were those numbers again - the backup alignment? [Pause]
For roll, roll is 171, pitch is 260, yaw 014.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. [Pause]
Roger, Bill. [Pause]
Roger. I'd like to clarify one item in the comments regarding the bias: the manual cut-off at DELTA-V counter equalled 100 feet per second. I read it as one-zero-zero and just wanted to make sure that you understood there's not a decimal point there. [Long pause]
Roger. I get you. You've deliberately loaded in a bigger number, and we cut off at a plus number manually by throwing the switch down, right? [Pause]
That's affirmative, but it's 100 and not 10. [Pause]
Right. I've got you.
Also, You did get the R, P, and Y align? [Pause]
Roger. I'll get that a little later. I'm right in the midst of an alignment here.
Okay. Sory to have bothered you.
No sweat. I plan to align this thing without mapping out the range, and boy, it's really wheeling around.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS. When it's convenient, you can go to BLOCK on your TM. [Long pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7. Houston through MILA. [Pause]
Roger, Houston, Apollo 7. [Long pause]
Bill, shortly after I left you and even while we were talking there, I [garble] the P51 and then do the P30 targeting - P40 and got a P52 alignment. I'd like to go through that at least one more time on a subsequent night pass, but as of right now, we're in pretty good shape on alignments. [Long pause]
Wal, I got the word that they took a look at the numbers over Redstone, and they looked very favorable. [Pause]
You mean the numbers in the computer?
Roger.
Very good.
Also, I would like to check one thing if you'll get the maneuver PAD. [Pause]
Got it right here.
Roger. The trunnion - trunnion is 201. [Long pause]
[Garble] too, did you not?
You read it back. I'm pretty sure you read it correctly; I just wanted to confirm. It sounded - I wasn't too sure about the first number, and so that's about two-thirds of the way down the PAD there, 201 for the trunnion. [Long pause]
Oh, yes. [Garble] star alignments. [Pause]
Would you say that agAin, please?
[Garble] backup alignment numbers - that was [garble]. [Pause]
Oh, yes. Well, I just sent those up because this was an important burn, and it was 171, 260, and 04_ for the roll, pitch, and yaw align. [Long pause]
Okay. Thank you. In case [garble] or something, I might have to use those at the last minute; I don't think it will happen, but ... [Pause]
Okay.
What I got to watch out for now is the fact we're lined up out of plane and this thing like to fly inplane. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. We still show you in ACCEPT. [Pause]
Roser. Thank you. [Long pause]
Also, Donn, I have a block data to read up. You're probably coming out of nighttime now, and to keep from having to give this to you over Carnarvon - you'll be coming up on nighttime pass - I'd like to get that to you as soon as possible, and then leave you free to use as much off the nighttime as possible on the next nighttime pass. [Long pause]
Good thinking, I'll get the block data out. [Long pause]
Go ahead with your block, Bill.
Roger. Before I start, I'd like to verify you have loaded the DAP with the DAP data update I gave you. [Long pause]
That's right.
Poger. Okay. Starting to read block data. 105 dash 1 Alfa plus 314 minus 0627 164 46 06 3446, 106 dash 1 Alfa plus 286 minus 0631 166 21 55 3485, 107 dash 1 Alfa plus 283 minus 1625 168 59 03 3038, 108 dash 4 Alfa plus 302 minus 1625 170 40 38 2787, 109 dash 4 Alfa plus 275 minus 1625 172 22 48 3072, 110 dash 3 Alfa plus 299 plus 1390 173 34 54 2890. Standing by for readback.
Roger. 105 dash 1 Alfa plus 314 minus 0627 164 47 06 3446, 106 dash 1 Alfa plus 286 minus 0631 166 21 55 3485, 107 dash 4 Alfa plus 283 minus 1625 168 59 03 3038, 108 dash 4 Alfa plus 302 minus 1625 170 40 38 2787, 109 dash 4 Alfa plus 275 minus 1625 172 22 48 3072, 110 dash 3 Alfa plus 299 plus 1390 173 34 54 2890.
Roger. Readback correct. Coming up on LOS; we'll have Canaries at 05.
Apollo 7, Houstou through Canary. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Donn, you might be interested: the S-IVB is just a bit ahead of you at about 400K, on the east coast Africa. [Long pause]
Oh, yes?
It's coming in.
Oh, it's coming in? Adios, big moose. [Long pause]
Houston, Apoll 7.
Go.
I think you need to give us a little advice along the way on these RCS quads. I'm going to switch them. I've already switched C, and I suspect A is getting down in that direction, perhaps B and D also. [Long pause]
Roger. Stand by.
I don't want to switch them until we have to, but I'd like you to help out.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. You're riding comfortable above on Bravo and Delta. You're getting fairly close to A, about 5 to 6 pounds above, and we'll keep you advised on that just like we did on Charlie quad. [Long pause]
Roger. Thank you. [Pause]
Roger. And you might check attitude again there. [Pause]
Roger. It's getting close.
Roger.
I'll try not to fire any thrusters.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're about 1 minute and a half here untll LOS, and we're transmitting through S-band. How do you resd? [Pause]
I read you fine, Bill.
Okay. Good. Thank you. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go.
Roger. Bill, could you find out exactly how many frames we have in this big set camera pack? Nominal numberr is something like 165. We appear to have more than that. I just wondered if anybody down there knows exactly how many. [Long pause]
I'll check. I'll try and get the word to you, but we're coming up on LOS. [Pause]
Well, whatever is convenient; no rash on it. [Pause]
We're checking. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We'll have Carnarvon at 40.
Apollo 7. Houston through Carnarvon. [Long pause]
Roger. Houston, this is Apollo 7.
Roger. Say, in reference to the passive thermal control test: we would still like to perform the test as per the procedure. A couple of points of clarification: the time of initiation is selected to get MAX time above 200 miles with channels disabled; also, the time to initiate attitude hold is 10 minutes past perigee so we shouldn't have too much of a problem there on the drag. [Long pause]
Okay. If you say so. We'll give it a whirl; if it's too bad, we'll probably have to modify a little bit going up. [Pause]
Okay. And. in that regard, there'll be two more of those tests, and they say if this is too expensive in fuel that we can just take a look at one of the two other tests that are coming up. We may just scrub one of those. [Long pause]
But I'm strongly suggest that if we get good results out of the first one. [Pause]
Well, they don't anticipate too much of a problem, but we'll just adopt a wait-and-see attitude on that one. [Pause]
Roger. Understand.
Also, in reference to your question on the casette: I've checked into this, and there are 165 frames MAX in there, and I asked them if you kept cranking what happened. Apparently, it just keeps turning, so you're not tajking any more pictures after that. [Long pause]
Oh, no, you've got to he kidding. Okay. Thank you for the dope. [Pause]
Right. Also, just for your informations on your pass over the States after the burn, you will be visible over Houston. [Pause]
Roger. Understand.
Just before sunrise. [Long pause]
I'm sorry, Donn; that's before the burn. [Pause]
Roger. Understand. [Long pause]
Say, Donn, how did the EMS DELTA-V test work out? [Pause]
We haven't done that yet, Bill.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Go.
Roger. Just gat a picture of Carnarvon.
Good. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. O2 tanks 2 fans ON 3 minutes, then OFF.
Apollo 7, Houston. Did you copy me on the O2 tank 2 fans? [Pause]
Roger, Bill.
Okay. And in about 2 minutes, we'll have LOS Carnarvon, and we'll require S-band volume up for Honeysuckle. [Pause]
Roger. Understand, Bill. And we just took three pictures, frame 3, 4, and 5 on magazine R of Shark's Bay, Carnarvon, and a terrain feature in Australia. [Long pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Roger. I've just been advised we're monitoring your condenser temperature on fuel cell number 2 at 174 degrees. This is 10 degrees higher than the other; there is a limit of 176 for alarm indication so you may get a light on that, but we are watcing it, and there is no cause for undue concern now. [Long pause]
Roger. You say if it goes up to 176 not to sweat it.
Roger. You get a light.
Right. I know; but we don't have to get excited about that?
Roger.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Honeysuckle; Guyamas at 20. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Guaymas.
I'd like to have ...
Roger, Houston. Good morning, Bill.
Good morning; how are you today?
Not bad. Say, I wonder if you could give me a readout on my fuel cell radiator 2 inlet and outlet test, please. Give me the trend for the last several hours. [Pause]
Roger. We're doing that very thing right now. [Pause]
We do have a partial warning light on, and it's reading about 177 or 178 on the condenser exhaust; the skip temperature has crept on up to about 435. [Long pause]
Roger. Our last reading on the fuel cell was 174, and that was 48 over Carnarvon. [Long pause]
Roger. I'm wondering about - if we get that trend, I'm sure you think it's probably a cooler pump failure, also. The other question I have is should we give some thought, to open circuiting the fuel cell now and throwing it on, letting it cool down a bit, putting it on just before the burn? [Long pause]
That's exactly our line of thinking; we'll get back to you on that just as soon as we take a closer look at the data here. [Pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Bill. [Long pause]
Go ahead, Bill.
Roger. In regard to your first request, we're still working on the trend. I told them to go back about two orbits. We suggest you open circuit the fuel cell and put it back on line at 165 plus 45. That's 15 minutes prior to the burn. Two fuel cells can handle the loads; however, the bus voltage is going to be about 26.5 to 26.6. [Long pause]
Roger. I concur. Say again the time for putting them back on.
At 164 plus 45; that's 15 minutes prior to the burn. [Pause]
Right. [Pause]
Got a morning report for you, Bill.
Okay.
Partial pressure O2 still 245 mm of mercury, so it looks like it's holding there. I'll knock off giving you those reading any more; I might take one the last morning. LMP 15 clicks of water this morning. I had 6 and 1/2 hours, maybe 7 hours of sleep. CDR had 4 and 1/2 hours of good sleep last night.
Roger. Understand. LMP 15 clicks of water, 6 and 1/2 to 7 hours of sleep, and the CDR 4 and 1/2 hours of good sleep. Also, Walt, you can turn the CRYO O2 tanks - tank fans off, tank 2 fans off.
They're off. Been off awhile.
Thank you. [Pause]
Good morning, Bill.
Good morning, Wally. How's everything?
Very good. Haven't heard you in awhile.
No, I've been on the off period here, I guess. [Pause]
Yes, they're trying to move us up earlier each day.
Right.
Understand you're a big TV fan of ours.
That's right. I've been running home from work just in time to watch. [Long pause]
Thought for today we were going to try for an Emmy for the best weekly series� [Pause]
I thought you were going to try for a Hammy.
Emmy.
Right.
Oh, you're coming back. I lost it. That's one for you. [Pause]
(laughing) That's a rare one. [Long pause]
That makes up for the involuntary "Oh, Boy" you gave us, anyway.
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houstibon. At the risk of belaboring the point, we'd like to confirm O2 tank 2 fans OFF and heaters AUTO. [Long pause]
Fans are off and the - I have one heater here on. Was that called ON during the night? [Pause]
Negative. That should be - [Pause]
Okay. The fan is off. [Pause]
Okay. For O2 tank 2, the fans should be off and the heater in AUTO. [Pause]
Roger. Understand. I'm going to turn the fan ON for 5 minutes. I had it off here. Looks like we may have had a heater go inadvertently ON instead of AUTO. [Long pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go Ahead, Bill.
Roger. You might tell Donn apparently he's trying to load that NOUN 48 there and having trouble in register 2. He's putting in a minus 49; and when he's checking it, it's coming back a 50. They say that's because of scaling into and out from. [Long pause]
Roger. I was having fun with that. If you put in a 49, it adds one; and if you put in a 48, it substracts one. There's no way to get 49 on there. [Pause]
They say that when you put the 49 in and enter it, it's okay. [Pause]
Yes, it's all right.
Okay.
I was just having fun with it. [Long pause]
Hey, Bill, notice how quickly our condenser exhaust temperature started coming dovn.
Yes, it's coming right down. [Long pause]
Hey, Bill, I'm thinking of manually balancing the hydrogen tanks right after the burn. [Pause]
Okay.
I'd like to have what you guys read out as quantites in H2 1 and H2 2. [Pause]
Stand by. [Long pause]
Walt, we're reading 42.6 in number - H2 number 1 and 39.2 in H2 number2. [Long pause]
Roger. I'll balance it after the burn. Tell Rita Rapp that ham and applesauce is a great dish. [Pause]
Roger. Ham and applesauce. We're coming up on LOS; we'll have Canaries at 39. [Pause]
As far as CDR's concerned, steak and eggs are better.
Amen.
Apollo 7, Houston through Canary.
Roger. Loud and clear, Bill.
Roger. Have you done the EMS DELTA-V bias test yet? [Pause]
Okay.
And as soon as you have finished with that, we would like a fuel cell O2 purge on all three. [Pause]
Roger. I'm going to go ahead and do that now. [Pause]
Well, we thought maybe that - no, I guess it wouldn't hurt anything. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. I have an update for the passive thermal control tests. However, if you are busy, we can hold off for awhile. [Pause]
Go ahead, Bill.
Roger. Passive thermal control, T zero 166 plus 50, T align 167 plus 16, attitude is 000. And that's it. [Long pause]
Roger. T zero 166 050, T align 167 plus 16, roll zero, pitch zeros yaw zero. [Pause]
Readback is correct. [Pause]
Bill, did anybody take into consideration our perigee torquing on that alignment? [Pause]
Yes, we had quite a discussion on that, Wally. And it turns out that - you spin this thing up about 10 minutes past perigee and go in attitude hold. They're willing to pay any penalty to get that thing set up for this so that you will be in the proper attitude at the proper roll rate as you go above 200 miles. If they use too much fuel on this, then they are willing to do away with one of the - or both of the other tests. [Long pause]
Okay. Let's have all of the DTO guys get together in a huddle and add up their willingness to spend fuel and see if it meets our budget. [Long pause]
Roger. Well, that's what we have already done, and they say they are willing to accept a cancellation of one or both of those later tests in order to get this done the way it is written out. [Long pause]
Okay. That's fair enough. I think we all - it's a new thing to all of us up here, and I think we should be aware of it. [Pause]
Roger.
I'm not complaining or anything there. It's a phenomenon that's going to hurt us every time. I'm explaining it right now, in fact. [Pause]
Roger.
I think I got advantage of it this time. It is driving me to the right attitude. [Pause]
Good.
Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up on LOS Canary. We may be able to get you at Tananarive at 01. Also, we would like the BIOME to CDR, and note we have lost CMP EKG; request check harness. [Long pause]
Lost CMP EKG. Roger. You notice that my main bus voltage, Bill, is runing right at 26 volts down here; it's going to trigger these lights on and off. [Long pause]
Roger. I just checked on that a minute ago, and we were reading 26.9. Let me check again, here. 26.7 to 26.6 we're reading here, Walt. [Long pause]
Okay. Well, it triggered off the master alarm a little bit ago, and I'm reading right at 26 on the onboard meter. [Pause]
Thank you very much. [Long pause]
Bill, what about the change of coolant pump?
Frames 5 and 6, taken at 163 hours, 59 minutes into the flight on the east coast of Africa.
Apollo 7, Apollo 7 through Tananarive. Over.
Roger. We're just now over Tananarive, and loud and clear.
Houston - Houston, do you read Apollo 7?
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
Roger. Loud and clear. The EMS bias test for the duration of the burn plus 30 seconds, which is when we turn it on, is 0.3 feet per second. [Pause]
Roger. 0.3. [Pause]
That's a minute and 36 seconds. [Long pause]
Bill, I would like to have you go over again what you have proposed for the DELTA-V counter setting on this burn. [Pause]
Okay. The DELTA-V counter setting will be 1728.0. What this does - it is 100 feet higher than the DELTA-V that you want to get, and you will turn the thrust switches off at 100.0 indication on the DELTA-VC counter, in other words, with a hundred feet remaining. [Long pause]
What is the reasoning behind that? The thing is built to turn itself off at zero. That's one of our primary checks on the SCS cutoff on the DELTA-V counter. [Long pause]
I'll turn it off if it doesn't turn itself off at zero. This is a complete departure from the way we normally use the DELTA-V counter and the SCS technique. [Long pause]
Roger. That is correct. However, the DTO calls for this as part of the test. I think it's in that little burn sheet on the inside cover of the flight plan. [Long pause]
The DTO is wrong, then. [Pause]
The DELTA-V cutoff in the DTO, as I see it - we've looked at it - says cutoff through thrust switches. I don't think enough people understand the EMS. I found that out as soon as we got it on board. [Long pause]
Walt, are you there? [Pause]
I'm here. [Pause]
Roger. We need fuel cell number 2 back ON at 164 plus 30. That's 30 minutes prior to the burn, instead of the 15 that I gave you. [Pause]
Okay. I'll do that, but it looks to me like it's going to - that will give us just about enough time to get up the alarm stage again. Donn is still reading 170 about on the condenser exhaust and 430 on the skin. [Long pause]
Let me see if I if get a compromise here.
Okay. I'll do - I'll go with whatever you guys want, but I would like to make sure we aren't jumping the gun. Also, I would like to know what your trim data shows on those radiators, so I will know whether to turn the pumps off or not. [Pause]
Roger. Stand by. I've asked for that. It's still in process. [Long pause]
Okay. Standing by. [Long pause]
Bill, do you understand the normal cutoff at a DELTA-V? That's what it's for. It will beat me any time. [Pause]
Roger. I understand that. In fact, the way I had understood this was that you were using the thrust switches to turn it OFF just to check them. It's part of a ... [Pause]
They better work; that's all we've got. They got three modes of cutoffs: G&N cutoff, DELTA-V counter going through zero, and then DELTA-V thrust switches. And I'm convinced that they must work, or I wouldn't be up here. [Long pause]
Right. This was a late change, Wally, and you have a 100 foot per second there to play with, so to speak. If they don't cut if off, then the DELTA-V will cut it off. [Long pause]
Roger. That's a late change to everything then; that is not the way we've been doing burn 5. And it says nothing about biasing the DELTA-V counter 100 feet per seccud. We've never done it. I'm hair-triggered for zero. [Long pause]
Hey, Bill.
Go.
I guess you have raised somthing in my mind. We did have an SCS burn where the DELTA-V counter did cut off, didn't we? [Pause]
Roger. That is affirmative.
Okay. Let's bias it about, say 50 fleet. I don't want to throw another 100 fleet per second on this beauty. [Long pause]
Wally, 50 feet bias - feet per second bias is okay. [Pause]
Okay. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Carnarvon; Honeysuckle at 22; S-band volume up. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. You might check the fans, might still be ON, O2 tank 2.
Apollo 7, Houstca through Honeysuckle. [Pause]
Loud and clear.
Roger. Did you get my call to check the O2 tank 2 fans? We are monitoring them still ON. [Pause]
I did, and I think you'll find them OFF now.
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Subsequent to our conversation on this DELTA-V setting, I just want to confirm that the setting will now be 1678.8. [Long pause]
Roger. We'll set it now.
Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston. A few minutes ago, you gave me the drift for the EMS DELTA-V bias test as 0.3 and 1 plus 36 seconds. I just wonder if I could get a readout of residuals from the EMS DELTA-V test. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Honston. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
The fuel cell condenser - looking at the condenser exhaust temperature of fuel cell 1 now, and the skin temperature, also. [Long pause]
But I do have fuel cell 2 back on the limes.
Roger. Thank you. [Pause]
[Garble]. Can you read me, Jack?
Apollo 7, Houston. Request a readout on the residuals from the EMS DELTA-V test. [Pause]
I ran the EMS DELTA - DELTA-V test is minus 21.7. [Pause]
21.7. Thank you. [Pause]
Hey, Bill, fUel cell 1 has got a skin temperature of about - between 435 and 440, and the condenser exhaust temperature is 178, it looks like now. [Long pause]
Roger. We are reading slightly lower tken that, but we are watching it. [Pause]
Okay. It seems to start coming down after I put two on the line, but I can't figure it out in regard to condenser exhaust temperature. [Pause]
We are studying the problem, too. [Pause]
Okay. We show number 1 coming, starting to come down slightly. We're about 1 minute from LOS Honeysuckle; Guaymas at 51 - excuse me, Huntswille at 47.
The time is 164 hours and 45 minutes. We are now in DAP control, NAV DEADBAND, 0.02-degree-per-second rate, and we are letting the DAP turn the spacecraft to the burn attitude. And then we are holding there.
Apollo 7, Houston through Huntsville.
Roger, loud and clear.
Houston, do you read?
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Roger. Bill, I just wanted to report the sextant star check was within a couple of tenths of a degree: very good. [Pause]
Roger. Within two-tenths of a degree. Thank you.
Right.
You have about 1 minute and -
On the alignment - this was a couple of hours ago - on the initial alignment, the gyro torquing angles were 1 degree, 2 degrees, and 3 and 1/2 degrees, respectively. [Long pause]
Roger. One degree. 2 degrees, and 3 and 1/2 degrees. [Pause]
Right. That was after the coarse align to the burn attitude. And at the fine align, torque angles were very small. [Pause]
Roger. Fine align wery small. I have an advisory regarding the burn, relating to the fuel cell operation. Number 1: make the burn with three fuel cells on line, of course, if at all possible. Number 2: it's okay to make the burn with two fuel cells; it would cost less than 1 ampere hour on the batteries. Number 3: if the condenser temperature exceeds 200 degrees F, remove that fuel cell from line except during the burn. [Long pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Walt, how are the fuel cells looking now? [Pause]
Roger that.

Roger. Our residuals are minus two balls 469 plus 00128 plus 0079; the DELTA-V counter is hardly visible due to the bright sunlight in the cabin at this time, even with the numerics still up, so we're having it cut off itself. [Long pause]
Roger. Understand. It cut off on the DELTA-V counter. [Pause]
That's right.
Thank you. [Long pause]
I'm reading 4.55 percent oxidtser left, and 3.8 percent fuel left on the SPS. [Pause]
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go.
That's your big mistake in changing the rules in real time. First off, we couldn't see the DELTA-V counter. [Pause]
Yes ...
Roger. We read that; I think that the situation is rather obvious now.
Okay. Let's then learn a big lessen from that. [Pause]
If you recall, we simulated that burn without doing that DELTA-V game. [Pause]
Roger. That Was a last mlnute change.
That's correct; it didn't hurt us. [Pause]
That's the reason we went along with it. [Pause]
The DELTA-V counter residuals is minus 17.2. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We have you in an 89 by 243. [Pause]
Roger.
Roger. I had a chnnce to look at the accelerometer; it was just smidgen under 1 g. [Pause]
Roger.
Which was a nice little experience for this long a period.
Right. [Pause]
It didn't even twitch a little bit when we took over a real nice transition into SCS MPDC. [Pause]

[Garble] completed either one.
Nice to hear. [Pause]
We may be mopping up water; we'll check that a little later.
Roger. That ought to have settled quite a bit out. [Pause]
We are realigning to the DSKY ALIGN.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Apollo 7. One minute to LOS; Canaries at 14. Over.
The changeover from the G&N control on the number 5 burn through the MTVC was very smooth. The error needles did not displace more than about 1 or 2 degrees, and the system responded very well coming back into null. And the roll went off about 2 degrees at the beginning of the burn on the G&N phase and came back in before I took over. I took over when all error needles were practically null, and the displacement was very minute, meaning that the ground update on the Q-ball was very good.
The burn proceeded normally until cutoff. One, the DELTA-V counter was hit by direct sunrays and was almost impossible to read. Two, a change in procedure that had not been planned for was implemented just before the burn. An extra 50 feet per secood was added to the DELTA-V counter to permit a DELTA-V thrust cutoff rather than a DELTA-V counter cutoff. And this, coupled with the sunrays on the DELTA-V counter, caused us to overburn 50 feet per second.
Apollo 7, Houston through Canary.
Roger. Hey, Bill. we've had our primary evaporator shut down for - coming on to about 36 hours, I guess, or 30 hours. How often am I going to have to reservice that? It's going to be suscepable to drying out just like the secondary, isn't it? [Pause]
Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston. Recommend leave primary evaporator as is. We will open up back pressure valve prior to 48 hours elapsed, and ground is not particularly worried about that. [Long pause]
Thank you. I'm glad they are not.
That's very reassuring. [Pause]
If you read, rock your tower, will you?
Roger. [Pause]
Hey, Bill, how come you let the third team stay on for the big burn? [Pause]
Well, we had to have some practice.
Yes, you'll have something to say in your press conference today. [Pause]
What's this! [Pause]
Aren't you having those duty press conferences when you break up? [Pause]
Oh, I've been working the graveyard shift. I haven't had any of those. [Pause]
Oh, the press corps goes to bed when you're working?
Right. Donn and I have been having conversations. [Pause]
Bill, we've been getting briefed during the day. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Canary; Tananarive at 31. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Our residuals are exactly 50 feet per second. [Pause]
Say again, Wally.
I said our residuals are exactly 50 feet per second.
Roger. Copy that.
The time, 165 hours 24 minutes; I don't remember if I recorded this or not, so I will do it again. The field of view in the sextant goes out to about 57 degrees; the field of view in the telescope is limited to about 38 or 39 degrees.
Time, 165 hours 30 minutes; I just mapped the field of view in the telescope and the sextant against the bright earth background. I find the telescope - both of them are symmetrical, that is, they are the same trunnion angle out to the edge of the field of vision all the way around. Telescope is about 42 degrees from the trunnion and the sextant is about 56 degrees. I noticed when we are looking at stars, that the field of view in the telescope seems to be more like 38 or 39. I think probably this is because there may be some greater light loss out at the edges that obscures stars, but does not obscure bright earth objects.

This is Apollo 7. Say again.
Put down a plot [garble] lake [garble] and Lake Victoria, frame 11, magazine R as in Romeo. [Pause]
Roger. Wally, just one thing on T align for this passive thermo control test: if you set in the T align that we have given you prior to 166 plus 50, you'll have to do it over again. [Long pause]
Getting good now. Did you say 166:507 Jack?
I'm sorry; that's 165 plus 50. [Long pause]
Starting out real nice down there today. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7. [Pause]
Go ahead, 7.
May I have the coordinates for the station at Tananarive? I'll try to get a picture of it.
Do it fast, though.
Roger. Stand by. [Long pause]
ApoLlo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Go ahead.
Donn. if you set in the T align that we gave you for this passive thermo control test prior to 165 plus 50, you'll have to redo it again. [Long pause]
We understand that. That's why we had it up there originally.
Okay. Real fine.
Yes, that's two for today. We've really got it in. [Pause]
Jack, why do I have to do it over, offhand? Is it that far in error, or did you say you were going to fine tune it? [Pause]
Well, what it does, you'll be over - one rev ahead on the integration there. [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7. Over. [Pause]
Hey, Jack, are you still there?
Roger, Walt.
Are you familiar with our fuel pump problem? Fuel pump 2? We got fuel pump 2 back on the line. Do you want me to leave it on until the condencer is off - temperature hits 200 and starts cycling back and forth between 200 on condencer exhaust and 380 on skin temp? Or just save it for when I need it? I'd just as soon leave it on the line, unless somebody else has strong druthers. [Long pause]
Okay. Walt, we would like to leave fuel cell on the line to see if TCE goes on up toward 200 again. [Pause]
[Garble] again, and if it's okay with you, I'll just leave it at 200 and cycle back and forth as per our cycling procedures. [Long pause]
Affirmative, Walt. [Pause]
Forget the Tananarive coordinates.
Houston, are you still there?
You still there, Jack?
Apollo 7, Houston. Go ahead. [Pause]
Roger. We have a large puddle of water on the aft bulkhead after our last burn; looks like it's probably a good pint. We've marked the perimeter of the puddle on the aft bulkhead, and somebody can calculate how much water was in there. [Long pause]
Roger. Understand.
You might make a note...
There is a kind of meniscus effect. This water sort of bunches up off the floor. [Long pause]
We also had water coming out of the water gun during the day, but not a lot. [Pause]
Okay. Copy that.
It's coming out in big drops. [Pause]
Have you been briefed on the problem we had on the fuel panel's number 5 burn with the 50 feet per second added? [Long pause]
Okay. Wally, the COMM here at Tananarive isn't too good. We'll pick you up over Carnarvon, and let's get a good rundown on it then at 165 plus 47. [Long pause]
Okay. [Long pause]
Getting to see [garble].
... a free ride.
On the onboard tape, we are getting a free ride again due to perigee torque.
At 165 hours 39 minutes, the water gun's putting out more gas than water at this point. [Long pause]
The local vertical attitude as to the perigee torque is 240 degrees pitch.
Roger. Copy that, Wally. We're just about to lose you over Tananarive. Pick you up over Carnarvon. [Pause]
You copying our perigee torque here?
I'm getting a 3 - about 0.35-degree-per-second pitch rate. Our pitch is about 250 degrees local vertical - now it's about 270.
Frame 13, magazine R for Romeo, horizon check at apogee of 240 miles.
Apollo 7, Housten through Carnarvon. [Pause]
Roger. I prepared your torque start on this one with the thrust on the perigee about 230 degrees local, pitch down 30 degrees, went right on down through 270; and as we climbed to a high apogee, there was not enough Q there to affect us, so we did a nice sweet loop right through apogee - [Long pause]
Roger. Copy that.
[Garble] through 90 degrees local vertical.
Roger. Copy that.
The remark I tried to make at Tananarive is let's not make changes in the system at the last minute. That's how I got a sweet little 50 feet per second overburn on that burn 5. [Pause]
Roger. Copy, Wally.
I thought we learned that a long time ago. It would have been 100 feet per second if I hadn't cut it down to 50. Our problem was the Sun hit right on the DELTA-V counter, and the burn switch was up full bright; and that was not sufficient to keep it illuminated. [Long pause]
Okay. Understand.
Now we did do burn 5 with MCC in the past. [Pause]
Okay. Wally, on the fuel cell: we have been plotting RAD IN and RAD OUT temperatures, and it looks like we got a good DELTA-T, so it appears right now that the coolant pump is working. [Long pause]
Good news.
Except what is the problem then?
Wally, we are really looking at the data here, and we are going to let you know as soon as we get some time history on the data after Carnarvon here. [Pause]
I think we're going to have a new page in that malfunctionbook.
What we would like to do is see if the condenser exhaust temperature will stabilize. That's why we would like you to let it go to 200. [Pause]
Got it.
We can't possibly have an internal problem, Jack. One of the things that surprised me was when I took fuel cell 2 OFF, fuel cell 1 then started to climb in condenser exhaust and skin temp and at a greater rate than fuel cell 3, although both of them were picking up the same amount of added load. Fuel cell 3 held everything right in there; its controls seem to be a lot better than fuel cell 1. And as soon as I put fuel cell 2 back on the line to pick up its share of the load, fuel cell 1 came back on down again. [Long pause]
Roger. We saw all that, Walt. We are looking right now at something in the regenerator there. [Pause]
Roger. Sounds about right.
And, Apollo 7...
[Garble]. To cut the 0.3 degree per second in pitch, and we will start looking for inertial. [Pause]
Roger. Nov, Wally, we showed ...
That's close to it, I figure.
We would like you to switch quad Bravo to secondary tanks now. [Pause]
Roger. Bravo secondary ON, Bravo primary OFF. [Pause]
Copy that. [Pause]
You must know something we don't on that one. Oh, you're reading that, aren't you? [Pause]
Roger. Wally, we used just, a little bit more than we expected duaring the burn on quad Bravo there. [Pause]
How close is the balance now?
Stand by. We will have it for you.
Good. [Pause]
Wallv, the difference between Bravo and Delta is 13 pounds. [Pause]
Okay. [Long pause]
Walt, I have this SPS propellant thermal control PAD to give you whenever you are ready. [Pause]
Wait one. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead.
Did you notice our DSKY?
Negative. I've been looking at the fuel cells. Stand by. [Pause]
And do you notice our inertial attitude? That's on you all. [Long pause]
We had free ride to 000; now, we got to go fly back again. [Pause]
Roger. Copy. [Long pause]
Hey, Jack.
Go ahead. [Pause]
Do you have the SPS propellant thermnl control update?
Roger. Your T zero is 167 plus 57, roll 004, pitch 183, yaw 020. [Long pause]
Is our T align required on this one? [Pause]
Negative, Wally. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, we are 1 minute LOS Carnarvon; we pick you up Honeysuckle. You want to turn your S-band volume up. [Pause]
Okay. What time do you pick them up, Jack?
We've got continuous coverage now. We are realty high; we've got wide overlapping coverage. [Pause]
Very good.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Pause]
Copy. But you sure have a lot of grass in the background. I'm keeping the volume down. [Pause]
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Would you check to see if with the Maurer movie camera, 18mm lens, at 1 frames per second, whether we overlapped on frame exposure? 0ver. [Long pause]
Okay. Wally, we have a real garbled signal here at Honeysuckle. I'd like to wait and get you through Hawaii. We pick up Hawaii at 166 plus 15. [Long pause]
Okay. The subject is the movie camera. [Pause]
Okay. I copied something about the movie camera, but I didn't get it all. [Pause]
Okay. I'll wait.
Roger.
The time is 166 hours and 6 minutes. I've just done the P52 to align for the passive thermal control test, and I've got some torquing angles here which reflect the error inherent in the coarse align. The numbers are plus 00970, minus 05627. That's 5-1/2 degrees in pitch, either gimbal, minus 00370.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Roger. I've stopped losing at playing the game with this deal on. Let's get a good mark on the perigee torquing. [Pause]
The whole thing's going to be automatic power as far as I'm concerned so that fuels on the ground test, and let's get some data on how fast it goes up at this high velocity at perigee. [Long pause]
Okay. Real fine, Wally.
As I see it, perigee is at about 43 just 7 minutes before the start of the test. [Pause]
Okay. Copy that. [Pause]
You might get prepared for fuel usage on this, too; I'd like to find out if this might be a setup you'd have just prior to a burn for some later mission. [Pause]
Okay. We'll get a real good hack on it as you go through.
Very good.
And I'm ready - what were you asking me about the movie camera? [Pause]
Oh, yes. I'm going to try to do some strip mapping. We did some in the States the other day when the hurricane was coming through. [Pause]
Roger.
And we shot at one frame a second with an 18mm lens, and I'm not sure whether we have overlap or not. Could you check on that? [Pause]
Okay. Will do.
And - we may need to use six frames a second, but, if so, we can handle that, too. [Pause]
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, Walt.
What about a map update when yon get a chance, Jack?
In work. [Long pause]
Okay. Walt, ready on your map update.
Go.
Okay. For REV 106, the time of the node is 167 plus 42 plus 37, longitude 157.3 degrees east. [Long pause]
Say the time again, please.
Roger. 167 plus 42 plus 37. [Pause]
Roger. Thank you. [Long pause]
And I have the morning news if you would like to hear it. [Pause]
I'm ready to copy.
We have the Xerox machine working. [Pause]
Roger. Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle 0nassis are to be married soon. She and her children left New York last night to join him at his home in Greece. He's one of the world's wealthier men, 62 years old, she's 39. We saw... [Long pause]
That's Greek to me.
Roger. We saw the spacecraft loud and clear this morning from Houston. [Pause]
Oh, great.
Very good.
[Garble]. [Pause]
And from the avalanche of cards and letters that Penny's gotten, everybody must have seen your sign. [Long pause]
Oh, no.
Hope somebody's reading them. [Pause]
We were trying for a - you can tell this on Bill Parker, he came back too fast - referring to a weekly series Emmy award, and he said "Hammy" award. It was broken today. [Long pause]
They'll understand; they were going to throw us in the category of specials. [Pause]
Roger. And Gladys is supposed to come onshore today near Tampa, early tomorrow. Winds are down to about 65 miles per hour; weather bureau calls it a minimal storm. [Long pause]
That's fortunate. [Pause]
And the US won its sixth gold medal in track yesterday by winning the high hurdles.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Roger. We lost you after the sixth gold medal report. [Pause]
That's all the morning news.
Okay. I send you one - thank the boys in the back room for the pitch and yaw gimbal setttngs; that was great on that engine. [Pause]
Roger.
Just slid right in.
Houston, Apollo 7. Are you through Honeysuckle [garble]. [Pause]
Say again, Walt?
You're coming through Honeysuckle, right? [Pause]
Can I confirm that that last map update that you gave was the next ascending node coming up? [Long pause]
Apollo 7, could you switch omnies? [Pause]
Roger. Jack, could you confirm that the map update that I have is for the next ascending node that is coming up? [Pause]
Stand by. [Pause]
I show 167 plus 43. Could you verify? [Pause]
Roger. Walt, the time of the node is 167 plus 42 plus 37; that will be for the orbit coming up. [Long pause]
Okay. Jak, if you get a chance in the future, we'd just as soon - we have the ascending node about ... [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
[Garble]. Two revs ahead because our chart is not as accurate as it used to be with our change in inclination. That way, we can have a more accurate chart for a longer period of time. [Pause]
Okay'. Walt, we just had a handover, and I didn't get all you said, but I th_wk the basic part of it is you'd like a map update about every two revs. Is that Charlie? [Long pause]
Negative. We'd like - whenever we call for a map update, we'd like to have it for about two ascending nodes in the future. 0ver. [Pause]
Okay. Copy that. [Pause]
Jack, you might tell the boys at Carnarvon we got a good picture of them today.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Did you get me an answer on that frame overlap?
It's in work.
Okay. We're about ready to strip here.
Okay. [Pause]
You can play the music.
Roger. [Long pause]
Houston, you have a little high cirrus today, but generally wide open. [Pause]
Roger. Concur. [Pause]
We see no thunderstorms in the Gulf, none to the west of you. There is a band of weather, approximately around the San Antonio area, and another band over towards New Orleans. [Long pause]
Roger. Thank you.
We are stripping at one frame per second.
Getting a good look at the hurricane, Jack. [Pause]
Roger.
She's high and wide. We are just passing the eye, got a glimpse of it. [Pause]
Took a photograph of it. That was frame 13 of magazine R. [Pause]
Okay. Copy that, Wally. [Long pause]
The Cape is loud and clear. We can see all the launch pad, and it looks like she's ready for business. [Pause]
We can see Saturn V on the pad.
Oh, Roger. [Long pause]
Jack, those guys over in Helmut Kuehnel's shop should have that answer for you by now on that film overlap. [Pause]
Roger. Wally, I've been riding them, and they say it's coming. [Pause]
Okay. Wally, I've got some happiness for you.
Go ahead.
Okay. For your fuel chart ...
Go.
... Okay. Present value on your chart should be 598. Your SCS redline 554, DAP redline 472, and the hybrid redline 236. How's that for happiness? [Long pause]
Very nice. We're up on it. [Pause]
And the quad balance is such that we have got all those redlines. [Pause]
Jack, does that 598 include the 60-80 pounds of unusable? [Pause]
Includes the unusable.
That's a chart update?
Roger. That's your chart update, Walt. [Pause]
Okay. I want to see what kind of fuel we use after this session.
Okay. [Pause]
We're whistling right through perigee. [Pause]
Are you plotting these on your chart down there, Jack? [Pause]
Yes, sir; I am.
Okay. Look at the difference between yesterday's number 666, and a 598. Like 68 pounds. [Pause]
Affirmative. We are calling it here. [Pause]
That's quite a big drop.
I agree. [Long pause]
Say, Jack, this is Donn.
Go ahead.
That seemed like an awful lot of fuel for no more than we've done since yesterday. Could you have someone run through their data down there and see if they can ascertain just when and in what condition we used up all the fuel? [Long pause]
Okay. We are doing a good analysis on it now, Donn. We will get it back to you. [Pause]
Okay. Because I don't think we should have used more than about 15 or 20 pounds at the outside for that burn today. [Pause]
Okay. In work.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead..
We've got an updated number for you on your chart; value. [Pause]
Go.
Okay. 628.
Ah, ha. That's a little better. That is much better hews. [Pause]
It's 30 pounds more happiness.
That's a heck of a deal, a real hump in that curve.
Roger. [Pause]
[Garble] about our fuel here if we keep that up. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are about to lose you at Antigua. We will pick you up at Ascension at 53.
Roger. We'll be passively thermaling.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Roger. Loud and clear. I'm pumping it out. [Pause]
Walt, something - a note of interest here. The TCE that you are reading on your gage is alrproximately 3 degrees higher than the actual value. [Long pause]
Roger. The - it triggered the master alarm at 178 yesterday [garble]. [Pause]
Okay. Copy that, Walt. And the answer, Wally, to your question on the 16mm camera: at 90 miles, when you are going through perigee, you'll have about 70 percent overlap at one frame per second, and at apogee of 265, you'll have about a 75 percent overlap. [Long pause]
Roger. Thank you. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7. Are you getting our data real time, or do you want us to be recording it? [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7. How do you read?
7, could you say again your message? [Pause]
The DTO requires low bit rate [garble] is it playing when we leave your control? [Pause]
Okay. Stand by, Walt. [Long pause]
Walt, we're playing the DSE as normal. We have a high bit rate over the stations. We'll put it low bit rate RECORD as we get LOS and opposite omni. [Long pause]
Roger. Just want you to know: we are doing a DTO now, and we will need the tape recorder back when we leave you. [Long pause]
We'll give it back to you as we leave you, Walt. [Pause]
Al_llo 7, we'd like to go quad Alfa SECONDARY. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, did you copy that?
Roger. [Long pause]
Walt, you are confirming quad A is in SECONDARY now? [Pause]
Affirmative.
Thank you. [Long pause]
Jack, say again about quad A.
Roger. Wally, we'd like you to switch to secondary tanks on quad Alfa. [Pause]
You want quad A SECONDARY. Is that correct?
That is correct. [Pause]
Quad A is now SECONDARY.
Roger. [Pause]
We're about 1 minute LOS Ascension; we pick you up at Tananarive at 08.
Houston - Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Roger, loud and clear.
The 36-minute point ended up almost exactly SEF, about 10 degrees - a little less than 10 degrees bank velocity. Pitch and yaw are essentially zero.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, opposite omni.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
I think you can notice our pitch and yaw staying in quite tightly here; we are just drfting with the roll rate. [Pause]
Roger. That's what we're seeing.
Roger. Just threw it to you.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead. [Pause]
Wally, on this SCS attitude control test tht's coming up: we would like to move it to - from 168:00 to 168:30; this will move it await from perigee,and you'll use less fuel. [Long pause]
Ah, ha. That's what I asked yesterday. 168:30? [Pause]
Roger. 168 plus 30, begin the SCS attitude control test, and you can cut it off at 169:10. Thought I'd help you out a little bit more: going 40 minutes rather than an hour. [Long pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Better take us T plus 3 hours into the test here. [Pause]
Say again, wally.
Okay. That's at the temperature part, I see.
Roger.
Okay. [Long pause]
I wish they hadn't had that in tight deadband. [Pause]
Also wish we had started at perigee.
Roger. [Pause]
It seems to be pretty close to the end of the test, so you can just make note of the numbers so I won't have to log them. [Pause]
Okay.
When you get LOS, just take your last number.
Copy.
Any rolls yet - any motions whatsoever - the drifting part. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
I'd say it's flying about a two - two and a half degree cone around the three zeros. [Pause]
Okay. Copy that.
This is very well. [Pause]
Wally, is that cone getting any bigger, or is it staying about the same? [Pause]
It seems to be getting just a little bit bigger now; it's going out to three as you can see. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
It is diverging slightly. [Long pause]
That proves a point; pitch is going out. [Long pause]
And the flight way rate developing which is making that pitch yaw develop. [Pause]
Copy that. [Pause]
And our Q is probably picking up - that's why. [Pause]
You're right at apogee now. [Pause]
Oh, it is now?
You're 20 minutes -
I'll be darned.
Oh, yes. We got 45 minutes to go, right? [Long pause]
How much more time do you have in this pass?
We are just about 1 minute LOS Carnarvon. We have a very low angle pass at Guam at 39, then Hawaii at 50. [Long pause]
Roger. I'm only about a minute away from end of test, so you can take these angles for us. [Pause]
Okay. We are copying them.
Roger. [Pause]
The reason yaw is decreasing, of course, is we are flying across the belly band now. [Pause]
Roger.
ApallO 7, Houston througgh Guam. [Pause]
Roger. Jack, incidentally, I'm manually balancing my hydrogen tanks now, and I'd appreciate it if you guys would keep an eye on those quantities and let me know when you think we're close on the balancing. You're a little more accurate than I am. [Long pause]
Will do.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. [Pause]
Roger.
