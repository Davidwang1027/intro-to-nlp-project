How does the weather look?
Not bad. About six to four-tenths scattered stratocumulus just coming in across Tallahassee at this point. See a little breakwater just south of there and the Jet [garble] going down to Orlando down by the ocean. [Long pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Just took a picture of the breakwater for you. That's frame [garble]. [Pause]
Did you request Crestview direct to Orlando? [Pause]
We use (laughter) Tallahassee direct to Canaries. [Long pause]
Right north of Daytona W, just about over Jacksonville, I guess. The sky is about three-tenths coverage, but the Cape is out in the clear. Do you have anything else you want to send up? It's a good day for it. [Long pause]
Nothing right now. [Pause]
We'll have you almost continuous coverage here through Canaries for another 15 minutes or so. [Pause]
Roger. I've got to get back to the store here and get this little food down. [Pause]
Okay. We'll stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Twenty-four hours and 6 minutes into the flight, five clicks on the water gun for the LMP. [Pause]
Roger. Copy. [Long pause]

Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Canary; we'll pick you up at Tananarive in about 15 minutes.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Roger. Loud and clear.
You're five-by, also. We'll have continuous coverage here through Carnarvon. ARIA 2 comes up when we lose Tananarive in about 8 minutes. [Long pause]
Roger. We have an observation for you: It's a confusing thing, we concede; but every tine we have transit at sunset or at sunrise, the particles that we have dumped through the dump system illumninate brightly as we have seen in the past. These affect the sextant and telescope observations severely. [Long pause]
Wally, I didn't quite get it. Are you saying that the dumps are affecting the sextant operation or is that... [Pause]
The reflection off the particles that came out the rear deck on water dump. [Pause]
Roger. Copy.
[Garble] stars, this would be a problem when we don't have the Earth to block out the Sun. [Pause]
Okay. Copy.
I would like to get that info to flight planing for subsequent flights. The recommendation was not to dump urine or water prior to a required sighting. [Long pause]
Okay. Copy that.
Roger. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Go ahead.
We have a COAS alignment for you.
Okay. Go ahead.
To place the X-axis of the spacecraft on target, the target must be located in the upper right Quadrant - the so-called northeast quadrant up 1 degree end right 1 degree. [Long pause]
Roger. Copy.
This is Apollo 7. I have the results of the Command Module RCS temperature check. [Pause]
Say again, 7.
I have the results from the commmand module RCS temperature check I've just completed. You may copy. [Pause]
Go ahead.
Roger. 5C and D and 6B, C, and D are all 5 volts. 6A is reading 4.90 volts. [Long pause]
Roger. Copy.
ARIA 2. Go REMOTE. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 2. Standing by. [Pause]
[Garble].
Okay. Walt, you're five-by. We're standing by.
ARIA 2 has acquisition, dropping in and out right at this time.
ARIA 2 has two-way lock; ARIA 2 has two-way lock.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. Standying by. Stand by. [Pause]
Roger. Read you loud and clear.
You're five-by. [Pause]
Walt, we pick up Honeysuckle in about 5 minutes. You might want to turn up your S-band at that time. [Long pause]
Roger. I give you and O2 partial pressure reading of 200 mm of mercury. [Pause]
Say again.
O2 partial pressure, 200 mm of mercury.
Okay. Copy that. [Pause]
Jack, I think you were breaking up. Did you say we should probably bring up S-hand on this pass? [Pause]
We pick up Honeysuckle in at 55 here. You can turn up S-hand volume if you want. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
By the way, how does S-band sound to you down there today?
Everything sounds res1 good. It is a real nice COM. [Pause]
Very good. We were surprised you fellows started talking over Tananarive this morning. [Pause]
Roger.
That was pretty bad yesterday.
Apollo 7, Houston. Could we switch your BIOMED switch to the commander? [Pause]
Roger. Ny pulse is down now.
Okay. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead.
Did you validate the BC [garble] 0197.8, is that correct? [Pause]
Stand by. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. That is the correct number at this time. We expect update, though, as we progress. [Pause]
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead.
Roger. just before band check, we're GO.
Roger. Copy. [Long pause]
Jack, could you give us an update on our ascending node? [Pause]
Roger. You want a chart update, is that - [Pause]
That's affirm.
Okay. Stand by. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. I have the orbital map update. [Pause]
Go ahead.
Roger. For REV 16, the GET of the node will be 25 plus 12 plus 45, longitude will be 168.5 west, a right ascension 06 plus 27. [Long pause]
Roger. Right ascension 06 and 27, and the crossing on the map is 25 plus 12 plus 45, 168.5 west. [Long pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Jack, on the cold I have, I took two aspirin before sleep last night and one Actifed. That is the total dose so far. Should I take another Actifed during this period? [Long pause]
Dr. Berry says, "Yes. Take another one during this period." [Pause]
Wilco. [Pause]
And we are currently doing the oxygen part of P5.8.
Can you read my intercom okay?
Fan 1 was turned OFF at 25 hours and 9 minutes. Correction, fan 2 turned OFF at 25 hours and 9 minutes.
While performing P5.8, the cryogenic zero-g test, the oxygen tank went to the 90 percent level, with the heaters OFF, the fans OFF [garble]. The pressure dropped very sharply, in a matter of several seconds, all the way down to 860 for oxygen tank 1 and 850 for oxygen tank 2 [garble].
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger, Houston. [Pause]
Apollo 7. We're going to pass - the present plans now are to pass the three NAV loads up to you - send three NAV loads up to you over Texas. Can you tell me how your last P52 came out? [Long pause]
Roger. Jack, the P52 came out fine. We got five balls star difference and [garble]. No problem with the optics. There will be [garble] and all came out fine. [Long pause]
Okay. That's real good news. We'll expect you to be in P00 sometime around 25 33 for these comand uploads here. [Long pause]
Fine.
Okay. One other message here this morning: the flight of Apollo 7 dominates the news this morning. We received a number of special messages regarding the flight, including one from President Johnson, who watched the launch on television at the White House. Here is his message to you. "Congratulations on the splendid beginning of this Apollo 7 flight. The nation is proud of you and the many in NASA, the services, and the private companies which have combined to make such a successful manned space flight. Everything in the President's office came to a halt as I and the Foreign Minister, Debret, of France watched with mounting excitement the magnificent launch of the Saturn IB. You can well imagine the great pleasure which filled the room as word came of your successful insertion into orbit. The path to the Moon takes courage, ability, and devotion to our goal. You are making a major stride in this star-studded way." Also, we received another message from Vice-President Humphrey, the Head of the Space Council, which says that the nation is proud of Apollo 7. Also, the Olympic Games start today in Mexico City. We'll keep you posted on the result.
Roger. Thank you.
Roger.
Hey, Jack, I just finished the CRYO fuel G test for the oxygen tanks at the 90-percent level, and it looked like there was very noticeable stratification at 910 psi. When I turned the heaters off and the fans on, the surface dropped in the left tank down to 860 and the right tank down to 850. All heaters and fans are back on AUTO now. [Long pause]
Okay. Roger. We copy. [Pause]
Jack, we look very good up here, and we've had our little crises, but [garble]. [Pause]
Roger. Thank you.
Jack, we just had a Program alarm 1105 downlink 25. Could you have somebody check that out for us? [Pause]
Okay. We copy that. We'll check it out.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger.
Roger. Donn, we would like you to key in ENTER so that we can look and see whether there were any additional program alarms. [Long pause]
Okay. Jack, I did, and nothing came up.
Okay. Real fine.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. If you will hit the RESET button, we can get rid of that program alarm 1105.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Jack.
Roger. If you will go to ACCEPT, we will send you up those three updates. [Pause]
Roger. You got it.
Okay. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. I have the MCC1 msneuver update that I'd like to give you whenever you're ready to copy. [Long pause]
Understand. This is an improvement on the last one?
Yes, sir.

Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Roger. Were you trying to send us some piano music then? [Pause]
Yes, we were trying to send you a NAV update for the CSM and target. And, 7, your sextant star check will not be visible after 26 plus 18 plus 00. [Long pause]
Roger. Twenty-six plus 18. Say, can you work up one for the COAS? [Pause]
Roger. Stand by. [Pause]
Apollo 7. There was no COAS star available at that attitude. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Our NAV loads are in and verified; the computer is yours. [Pause]
Roger. We've got it. Thank you. [Pause]
And, Jack, we'll be standing by for when we go ahead and restow the cabin gas analyzers and have it out of our way. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. You can go ahead and stow the cabin gas analyzers. [Pause]
Roger. Thank you. I'll give you one final reading.
Okay. [Long pause]

Roger. Thank you.
We're still in 8 hours of our prime time.
Roger. [Long pause]
7, you're 1 minute LOS; we'll pick you up at Ascension in about 3 minutes. [Pause]
Roger. We're in good shape here.
At 25 hours, 52 minutes, we'd like to log two suggestions for housekeeping. One is using the channel grip fitting on the water gun to pick up goblets of water, or droplets of water. The other is to clean the inlet screens that go in the red tip of the two hoses, knock it off on one screen, and then take the dust and debris off with tape.

Apollo 7, this is Houston. We will be monitoring through ARIA 3 at this time.
Probably showed the results of that [garble] exercise we did a few minutes after the NCC 1 burn. I started at...
Apollo 7, through Hawaii. Standing by.
Roger. Jack, I just did a preliminary T dash 20 to look at the hoosier, and I think I saw it, but it was a little hard to tell because of all the debris out there. I've been picking it up since sunrise and the AUTO OPTICS put something right in the middle of the sextant which appeared to be an object rather than just a point light source, and I'm sure that is it. Like I said, there is a lot of trash and debris [garble] it's kind of hard to tell. [Long pause]
Okay. Roger. We copy that, Donn.
Hello, Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read?
Read you five-by, 7. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. At 27 hours into the flight, we're fixing to take some pictures of the [garble]. [Pause]
Roger. Understand. And, Walt, over Texas in in about 3 minutes, we're going to have three NAV loads that we'd like to send you. There will be no NCC2 maneuver, and I'll pass you your maneuver PAD as soon as I get it. [Long pause]
Roger. Waiting and ready. [Pause]
About 3 minutes, we got a completion statement.

Apollo 7. Proeeeding down trip to direct Houston. [Pause]
Roger. Copy. [Long pause]
Hey, Jack, when we go past Houston, run outside and wave, will you. We want to look at you in the sextant. [Long pause]
And when you get back in, Jack, why don't you have the EECOM take a look at the performance of the fuel values and if they are matching up my performance curves. [Long pause]
Say again about the fuel cells, Walt.
How about having someone take a look at how they are doing with the specs on the performance curves. Looks a little low to me. [Pause]
Okay. Will do. [Long pause]
Apollo 7. Just cleared New Orleans; going direct to Orlando. [Pause]
Roger. Copy. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, your Houston. I have NSR PAD that I'll give to you whenever you are ready. [Pause]

Roger. Say again after NA, and it seems to me the CAP COMM's - there is a difference in purpose here - I think you're giving an NA for each line. [Long pause]
Roger. Let me read after the burn time. Burn time is 0 plus 08 NA NA NA. Do you want - did you get copy NOUN 34 NOUN 43? [Long pause]
Did not.
Okay? 027 17 all balls plus 1959 minus 05534 1750 001 096 000. I have a correction on the NOUN 33 time. That should be - the second should read 5600. [Long pause]

Roger. He's doing a pretty good job today. [Pause]
Thank you. You guys are, too.
Jack, how are we looking on our fuel budget? [Pause]
Could you say again, Walt?
This is Wally. How are we doing on our fuel budget? [Pause]
Okay. Just a minute. We'll get it right to you. [Pause]
[Garble]. [Pause]
Wally, on the RCS budget: we think we'll be right on nominal going into TPI. [Pause]
Great.
And Jack, okay, we've got our tape back now, I guess, or are we dumping it if we use another 32 pass again with no tape to log that stuff on. [Pause]

Houston, Apollo 7. Wish to commence battery charging on battery A; I would say a curve right now of about 2.3. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're about 1 minute LOS Carnarvon. In 2 minutes, we'll pick up ARIA 3 for about 10 minutes monitor pass, and going over the hill here, it looks like a real good burn. [Long pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 3. Standing by. [Pause]
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston through Guam. Standing by. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Guam; Hawaii in 8 minutes. [Pause]
Roger.
Roger. Jack, I've got the target instructions; it seams to be tracking pretty smooth now. I loaded in 29 hours, 20 minutes for first cutoff, TPI, and I got 29, 20, and 29 seconds back. Not too bad for a start. [Long pause]
Not too bad.
Apollo ? through Hawaii. Standing by. [Pause]
Thank you.
Jack, I've got about 8 minutes here [garble]. The thing is really taking in there, right on the money. [Long pause]
Roger. You're fading in and out, but I think I got it. You're tracking okay.
Huntsville two-way lock, out of range.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. Go ahead.
Why can't,we get the RECORD mode here? Donn has got a lot of comments he ought to be putting on tape. [Pause]
Thank, you. [Pause]
[Garble] Are you recording, this down there?
Are we recording?
Roger. I'm almost 3 minutes into this TPI solution here, and it seems like quite awhile. I was wondering when you are planning to take it off. [Long pause]
Roger. Donu, we're trying to mark the polar plot along with you here as you go through the solution. [Pause]
Whenever we call P34 or some such thing, you can expect it to drop the tracking or move off some, and then it will return after you get back to the basic program. For instance, the P34 solution just came back, and before we got it [garble] target [garble]. Also, I did an attitude maneuver of 3 or 4 degrees a minute ago which kind of started me [garble]. [Long pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger.
Roger. Walt, we'll have a clean tape for you to record the rendezvous on at Antigua LOS which occurs about 28.54. [Long pause]
Roger. 28.54.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. I have you TPI update PAD. I will give you when you are ready to copy. [Pause]
Ready to copy. Go.
Roger. 029. 183400 plus 150 plus 019 minus 075, 168/46 forward, 020/11 right, 003/03 down, 075/08, 01960 minus 0729 02240 35950 133 trunnion check. The GET of midcourse 029 plus 23 plus 00. Remarks: you will be flat at TPI.
Roger. That's flat at TPI mideourse. 029 plus 23 plus 00, TPI update follows: 029 183400 plus 150 plus 019 minus 075 168 46 forward 020 11 right 003 03 down 075 08 01960 minus 0729 minus 0240 35950 133 on the trunnion. Over. [Long pause]
Roger. Your elevation minus 5 minutes, I copy; it should be 02240.' [Long pause]
Is that - oh - 02240. [Pause]
Roger. Everything else correct. I'll give you a DELTA-VM cutoff in a minute. [Pause]
Your DELTA-VM cutoff will be 90.
Ninety, read.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Go ahead.
Roger. Walt, you have a clean tape on the DSE. You should have three switches in proper positian there, TELEMETRY INPUT should be HIGH. Your FORWARD REWIND switch should be OFF, your UP-TELEMETRY switch - COMMAND RESET to NORMAL. When you want to record then cycle the FORWARD REWIND switch to FORWARD, then OFF. [Long pause]
Roger. But we don't want to be recording at PCM HIGH yet; we want to still get all the RCS burn on high bit rate. Over. [Pause]
Okay. Stand by. [Long pause]
Okay, Apollo 7. You are GO the way you want to do it. We'll have a mixed dump, but that will be okay. [Pause]
Roger. Do you understand that I'll begining - I'll be stopping the tape and going to high bit rate for each of the RCS burns; and after the last RCS burn, I'll run at high bit rate right on into the rendezvous till the tape is up. [Long pause]
Roger. we understand that.
Alright.
Okay. [Garble] we normally do here.
Boy, it really looks great out there.
Yes.
Now, we'll be out over the Atlantic shortly.
A little sideways here. There it is. Want to write that one down, Walt? That's it, yes. That's the one we'll go for, and I'm not going to take any more marks.
If I would have known it was going to be that fast, I would have waited, but see, those other ones took about 4 minutes apiece.
Okay, let's go.
Okay. Right. Got them? Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. Standing by. [Pause]
Roger.
How is that time, Wally?
Okay. It's night. Wally, I'm just going to let that sit there for awhile because I don't want to terminate P20 just yet.
May be some help in AUTO OPTICS here.
Really? Man, that's cool. Yes, I think we got her wired. What I'm going to do is sit here and let P20 cook away, now...
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
... until after we get the backup data, and then I'll go on into P41, and you can start a slow pitchdown to start that burn attitude, and if it looks good, I suggest we go ahead and do the...
Apollo 7, Houston.
... DAP again. Okay, let it take it to their attitude and...
Go ahead, Houston.
Just for your information only, the tracking data across the States indicates that TPI could occur about 30 seconds earlier. All our other values remain unchanged. [Long pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Roger. What was our time, Walt? 16 something, wasn't it?
16:45. That's pretty good because they give us...
Roger. We show 16 plus 45 on our solution. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
It's been backing off 30 seconds. They said - it could be 30 seconds late. That's pretty good, that's a minute and a half. We're well within the ground rule, so that makes the DSKY sound pretty good to me.
Yes, well, I didn't like that. Yes, I am, Walt. I'll just stay down here. It's easier. Hell, this timer down here is wiped out. It just jumped another 10 minutes.
It's 11:07.
What have we got, Wally:
I'll give you MARK at 11 now, 7. I'll give you a MARK at 11.
11 minutes to go?
MARK.
Okay, I think I'll just use my wristwatch.
Okay. It's 28. I'll give you ten, 30, or do you want ten?
10:30 is fine. Well, 10 would be better.
okay. [Pause]
Thirty-five seconds. [Long pause]
Okay.
Ten seconds, three, two, one.
Huh? 10.
MARK. [Long pause]
MARK.
No, I don't.
Well.
Man, this is going to be tough, I think. Well, it's getting - what the hell are you shining in my eyes, Walt?
Oh.
It's dark out there, and all I can see is a flashing light. It's not all that bright.
Pretty good level?
Are they good numbers? [Long pause]
No, not yet. Wait a second.
Wally, it's no longer in automatic attitude control. I mean, it's not a complaint, but it is just holding attitude in DAP.
Okay.
19 plus 41.
Now.
What are we supposed to be...
Apollo 7, Houston. Tananarive in 10 minutes.
Okay, give me a holler at 8 minutes, gang.
Yes.
Yes, it's okay for now.
Rate?
Okay.
You got about 2 seconds here, and I think I can clear it.
That's the same engine.
Wait a minute. No, I didn't - that's a better one, isn't it?
I screwed up. I didn't [garble].
Well. Well, I lost it now.
Well, where did you go, you little devil? Well, I pulled off the eyepiece for an instant, and it's disappeared. And it's not on the telescope either. It's only that slight line [garble] P54 to show up in the telescope. And the sextant field is really too dim, so there you are.
Yes, I guess so; we'll have to. Well - I think it has gone to - AUTO OPTICS is gone now, and I've got to do it manually, and it's not there.
That's right.
Okay, Walt, I guess we better pitch down and go to the boresight attitude. And, well, we'll see what the hell we're going to get from the DSKY solution. I think we can go MANUAL if you want - probably be a little cheaper. And we could put it back to DAP when we get there.
Right.
Well, that was a surprise.
It's the [garble] attitude.
Okay, 52 degrees inertial is your pitch angle, Wally, and plus 9 degrees out of plane. Our vector should be less than out of plane at TPF of zero.
Well. Walt, oh, you don't have that. How did that check with the ground? They gave you some solutions, didn't they? Did they give you local vertical coordinates?
They didn't give us any local vertical?
Okay, let me see it.
Here we are, we're absolute - right on, 15.0, 7.9, and 1.9 out of plane. Wally, I suggest we take about half of that out of plane. Not, not all of it. Let's roll up about 5 down and then you take out about - about 4 degrees of yaw. How's that? Well, let it fly to its attitude, and then you can override it manually, and bring it into about 4 degrees. It'll be about 8 degrees out of plane and if we pull it back into about 4 or 5, I think it'll just about jibe with the ground.
Yes. Okay.
You're at CMC hold?
Okay, let me check that beauty. Alright? Here we go.
Is it there?
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
Well, you might, because you have less light loss in the window that I do in the telescope. I mean - whether or not you'll see it, I don't know. Hope we are a little closer now.
Okay.
Huh?
Well, just a minute.
What?
[Garble] a lot. Sure wouldn't want to have to put up with it, though. Okay.
Well, that's interesting.
Okay.
Okay, I'd take about half of that yaw back out of there. Yes, go left about 4 degrees. Yes, you can do it right in CMC, AUTO. Yes. It'll go over. Okay, there you go. Just hold that. Okay, I'm going to proceed from this display now. Now, when those flop over, it'll be time to burn. Actually, it'll happen about 15 seconds early.
What? This is your INERTIAL HOLD attitude. This is your ORB RATE, and it looks like it's going to be pretty close to 28 degrees. Move 17.6. Okay, Walt? 17.7.
Put it up after awhile. Okay.
15.7. Well, we'll overburn 0.01. Why don't you leave it propped here for a minute here, ahd then you can...
Very good.
Good.
That's it. Yes, burn it out. Okay.
Yes.
17.3 on the DSKY. It would - I don't know, it's 3, and then 6, then he starts jumping, so - You almost had them right in there. Well, just a minute, you're all - you are essentially all fore and aft. Man, perfect! Okay, I don't know if you want to - I'd leave it. I don't think you're going to do any better than that. We've got plus 1, plus 3, and minus 3 on the residuals. There's a chance that we're going to press on from there.
[Garble] residuals on the DELTA-V counter.
Okay, okay. Now, I want to - okay, LOW BIT RATE. I don't care.
Anybody seen my checklist? Goddamned thing, where did it go? Well, so much for that.
Wally, are you in CMC, AUTO? Okay, it should start maneuvering us back up there in a minute.
Okay.
There's my checklist.
Huh? You can keep that. Yes, okay.
[Garble] manual [garble].
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by. [Pause]
Roger. The residual was very low on that TPI.
[Garble]. [Pause]
Okay. I read them all, and they were very small. [Long pause]
Now, don't be scared, this is a phony mark. It's going to be a big number. At least, I hope it's a big number. First call going out to 7 via Tananarive.
Not all that big, is it?
Houston, Apollo 7. We made the TPI with the onboard solution, that's the computer solution, in DAP. [Long pause]
Walt, we've got real bad COMM here at Tananarive. We can read you saying something, but we can't make it out. [Pause]
The TPI burn was on the computer; onboard solution. [Long pause]
Me couldn't make it out. We made out the word TPI, and that was all. [Long pause]
Can you confirm that you've burned TPI?
That's affirm. Affirmative.
Roger. We got it. Tbank you. [Long pause]
Okay, I'll get you one in just a second. You want to give me a time hack?
Roger [garble] stand by.
Okay. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Okay, thank you. No, it's 5 minutes from the burn. I just wanted to see how long - how far away we were.
If you want to.
Wally, this thing is just barely visible in the telescope now. It is very bright in the sextant, however; flashing light.
Well, I'll tell you. That's really screwed up. We were doing fine up to then. I mean, hell, you lose it, you just have to - I didn't realize it would just flat disappear like that.
Man alive!
This flashing light is absolutely spastic, on the booster. It's bright as hell sometimes, and then again, you can hardly see it, and it's erratic, it's irregular, you know. It isn't - it's either moving around or else those lights are screwed up, I don't know which. Yes, probably turning around.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are 1 minute LOS Tananartve. We'll pick you up for a short pass at Carnarvon in 9 minutes.
Okay, you guys give me a call for - we got about 8 minutes past or 52, whichever. Might as well. Okay, thank you. Okay, fine, I'll get it for you. Okay, I'll do one more mark, and then we'll go for the backup.
Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read now?
No, you didn't either, or else you're going to use them right here. Okay, VERB 85 coming up. Now, let's see. 10 seconds? Man, I didn't get so far, did I?
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
That'll do it. Ready?
Okay. I'm going to get a mark in between here.
Good deal.
Yes, he may, especially when he gets sunlight. I think once he gets out in the Sun, it won't be so bad.
(Laughter)
Alright (laughter).
We should have a few minutes.
How many minutes, gang?
10. Okay. Don't lose track. I've got a watch running - after all, this timer down here is crummy - it's all screwy. Okay.
Okay, you finished? Okay.
Okay, I'm going to proceed at 22:30 and this will calculate a burn which we'll execute at this amplitude if it is big enough to be worthwhile. I hope it isn't. I'm going now.
We may be a little late. This thing is pokey compared to what our sim - the simulatorsr show. If it's late, we'll just burn it late, Wally. I don't think it'll matter all that much.
Okay - that's about - hit it one more time - 3.6.
Yes, let's see what it says, first.
Okay. I don't particularly want to take off 3.7 feet per second. I'll go along with your value, Walt. Okay, let's take off about 2 and let it go. I can't believe it. I don't - yes, sir, it's 2.
It'll - Okay, this is - Okay, yes. We're not - yes, Just wait until I get to the ...
Okay, have I got time to do a mark, or do you want to watch your data?
Walt, what time is it? Wally?
16 or 44, whichever you got.
Okay, that's all I wanted.
Okay.
Yes, it'll do that now and then. I don't know what the hell's the matter with it.
Well, wait a minute. What the hell is it doing?
Okay, got it, Walt?
Yes.
I'm going to have to get at least a mark in here. Oops, I can't do that yet. I have to get out of this thing now.
Where are you now?
Well.
You're going to have to get this a little late then, because I - it's coming out of these marks.
Okay, good. I need it.
The DSKY is not pulling it in too well right now on the optics.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
I am almost tempted to do the marks in the telescope. The damn thing's jumping around so much.
Okay. You dirty bastard, you ran off again.
Okay. Got it?
Is that your first or your second one now?
Is that your last one? Recently? Okay. All right.
7. One minute LOS; Guam in 7 minutes. [Long pause]
Roger. Coming up the pike.
Okay, we're performing our...
Roger.
... midcourse and we're calculating for a minute and a half. I do have Orion, Wally, and think if we go on up, he'll come right up in your window when you get up there. Now, this thing never did pull it back into sextant, and it got it in within a couple of degrees in the telescope. That's about as good as it did, so I don't know what the hell - and the problem with the backup solution is that all I can see is the damm flashing lights, and they are all over the place, and it's just hard to, you know, say what's the middle of the booster. Okay.
Oh, sob! Hey, we're in! Look at that: 0.07! I can't believe it. Okay, alright, let me do the procedure. Call up 41 just for the hell of it - not for the hell of it, but just to see what it can tell us.
That's great. Look at that.
No, nothing.
That's right.
The last midcourse requires no correction.
Real fine news. [Pause]
Okay, don't - don't do any more thrusting because I'm going to P00, and it's - it's on to you, Wally, and I think if you pitch down to -
Yes.
What was our last angle, Walt?
Okay, so if you pitch down to about 63, it ought to be there (laughter). I hope the hell it is.
It's going to be bright. It's flashing, and it's erratic, and sometimes it's weak, and sometimes it almost blinds you. I don't know - it must be moving around. Well, I can't do much down here. I might as well.
Yes.
Okay, Wally, I'll bring the whole thing up there. There you go.
Okay. Boy I can tell we're -
Wow! (Laughter)
About -
Apollo 7 coming right on up the pike.
Boy' What a trauma. Jesus Christ' What would you do -
I see it [garble].
You know, if you could - okay.
You are 2.7 miles by the DSKY and 31.8 closing. I don't really believe that.
I'll - I'm very suspect of this DSKY solution.
No, wait a minute, that's right. That's bleed-off.
Okay.
About 24-1/2 down. You are going to screw it up.
I hope we hit some daylight, for Christ's sake, before we get in there.
No, no, but...
Okay, you're 29 feet per second closing, according to this. How big is he in your scope?
Okay. You can go DAP if you want to.
We're about to start. And let me get the program 47 - or 50, please.
Okay. Yes, you want a theta? See if he's on, I'll get it for you; coming up. Okay, I got 88.6. Is he in the middle, Wally?
Okay, then add one, Walt, because your sextant's a little off. No, subtract one, I guess you would. The hell'with it! What the G&N is at this point doesn't matter - you're close enough to the line, It's just V going to - which way? Rotating, yes.
Wait a minute. Okay. Boy, we didn't get that! It won't matter. It doesn't matter; assume it'll just cost a little more; 47 hasn't come up yet, so if you want to get it all in - why - no. But that's all that you need, and hell, throw it in. We can estimate what you're shooting - what you're shooting here. It's okay. You can go now anytime.Yes. Either one. It matters not. Okay. It might be easier on SCS: you won't have to flip so many switches. Okay, he burned about a half a foot a seeond, right, Walt?
Yes, okay.
Well, we're fatter than a hog right here; we've got more DELTA-V than we can - well, so far, we've only used about 24. So, you're going to have about - What's that? I hope they'll he coming to daylight pretty quick. Hold it there for your DELTA-V's. Okay.
I'd say 1-1/2 miles.
Your - your DELTA - your - your - the DSKY solution at this point is - is fine. It's 23 feet per second, closing at a mile and six tenths out and that should bleed off to about - well, it just popped to 22, so I don't know which one's right, but we're - we're beating the zone and here comes daylight, thank God. Well, you may - (Laughter)
Well, okay. Daylight with 2 feet left. It's 1 degree...
Apollo 7, Houston through Guam. Standing by.
... 1 degree. You're better off [garble].
Okay, go SCS and we'll - huh? SCS is too sloppy? Why don't you turn down MIN DEADBAND? Well, you're not going to save enough from here on in to matter, I don't think.
(Laughter)
How big is he? Can you get a measurement on the diameter? Oh. Now - you mean he's whirling around. Yes. Can you? If you could - if you can just get a gross hack, like - is it a degree or a tenth or - okay. Okay, you better take off some. I'd take off so far - about 5 feet a second. Yes.
Just check it off. I got it on the - on the outfit here [garble]. Well, okay. You don't have to take it all off then if he's not half a degree. Okay. Maybe we should take the stop on [garble]. Okay. You didn't pull off the whole 5, did you? Okay. Alright. You mind if I reach over and jeer at that DELTA-V meter for you now and then? That'll help me, too. Okay. Fine.
What did he - if he's a degree, you better start pulling off. Okay. You better pull some off because he's coming in pretty quick. I'd pull off at least 5 more.
He's not a degree yet. Okay, even if he's a degree, he's 1200 feet. Now I'm talking the diameter, not the SLA panel. Good enough. Okay. Okay. Okay, you better pull some more off. Is he 1 degree yet? Okay, pull it off. I'd say pull off about 8. Yes. So make it 13 on your dial. Yes. I wish I could see him (laughter). Okay. Okay, I think it's just about on you from here on in. Well, good thing. She hit another [garble], huh?
You devil.
You on HIGH BIT RATE? Okay. Okay. Slowly, I hope (laughter). Okay. Good. Fine.
What's that? 130 degrees? Yes.
(Laughter)
This is it. Yes. 123 degrees (laughter). Where the hell is he? I'm going to sneak up and look. Maybe I can see him now. Yes, I can. You're in good shape. You're still quite a ways out. Well, from here on it's just drifting in. What is it, about a degree in your scope or a little bigger than that? Okay. Well.
Yes, [garble] in a while.
No. I don't know. You've been watching. I can't tell if it's drifting or not [garble].
I wouldn't worry about it. You're in good shape.
Yes.
This says 37 feet per second. I don't know whether that's right or not. That's NOUN 40.
Okay. Yes. I figure the - if this thing's right, you got - you're up to that.
Well, what the hell is it doing? It keeps integrating all the time.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Guam; Hawaii in 8 minutes. [Pause]
Roger. We're closing at about 7 or 8 feet, and we're just about locked up initially. [Pause]
Real fine, Wally.
Looks like we used between 50 and 60 feet per second. At this point, we're just essentially holding station, moving in slow. [Pause]
90.
Real fine.
You - I don't - I -
Hell, I don't know what I have frankly because these Goddamn numbers are jumping around on that DSKY like I've never seen it before. And I never do believe NOUN 40 because that son of a bitch sits there and integrates when there's nothing going on. So - I guess I'll have to eat my hat on that comment about...
What were we calculating?
We could in the simulator, however...
However, today it's just all over the lot.
I think I got most of it - we were pitching left and right there, and I couldn't quite keep up with - and I got one big one in here, 12 feet a second, I don't believe, because I don't think you ever burned that long in one direction.
Great. This is - hey, dad! You got to find what film?
A-men! It's really in now. [Garble] really rolling (laughter).
That's why it's so hard to see, you know. Sometimes those lights get you right in the face and the next time they don't even flash.
Upper or lower?
(Laughter) Hey. Break out the champagne, God damn it, we made it!
Right, I have a whole cup of coffee to celebrate that mother!
Yes. Get some 16's of that dude going around. That's great. That's a wild bomber, isn't it?
I need a drink (laughter).
How would you feel over there if that were a little bitty thing about l0 feet across and there were two guys in it? With no radar?
Huh?
Outstanding. Okay, watch it. He's coming in pretty fast. (Laughter)
I would say, Murphy, that you done made a rendezvous, or we done made a rendezvous. And we done stabilized it. Looks pretty good. See? Yes, I think that's close enough in [garble].
I want to record on tape, it looks like all four SLA panels are equally deployed now.
Yes, and - she's still coming at us.
(Laughter) Just at you!
Looks pretty sturdy to me.
I think on this fuel budget I'm just going to take this [garble] number for what it's worth, and use whatever PIPA bias is built in there.
Okay.
20. She's coming up on 21.
Yes?
Okay, Wally. You've used about 80. I guess we'd better knock off, huh? If we can get her stabilized and sit there, fine. If not, I guess we'd better shove off.
Well, we're not very far. You've got 200 or 300 feet, maybe.
Well, I don't know, I can't tell from where I'm sitting. How big is it in the sextant - in the reticle there, Wally?
Does he fill it? Is he - 10 degrees. Okay, he's about 120 feet, Wslt. I gave you a bum steer.
Yes.
Nice job, Walt.
Yes.
[Garble] 10 degrees.
Yes, look at that.
No, your midcourse solution saved our ass. If we'd burned that DSKY solution, which I wouldn't have believed anyway, but if we'd burned that midcourse on the DSKY we would not - probably slid up in there at night.
You didn't have any up until now, did you?
No, I mean at the end there. You didn't do any Z at all hardly.
What - what time is it? Well, the time was about right, too. We were pretty close to nominal.
Yes.
You look like [garble].
(Laughter) Hey, we're 2 minutes early, gang. (Laughter)
29:57. No, actually - with the TPI on here. We were just about on the nominal. I - I'd judge we've been here about 5 minutes station-keeping.
(Laughter) Okay. 19 and -
Okay. I'm going to have to say we used about - well, if I believe this NOUN 40, which I really don't, I don't think we used that much, but if you do, then we've used up about 80 feet a second, 78 - or so. Something like that. But I don't believe NOUN 40 because, according to the word I got, that thing integrates PIPA pulses both ways, and you know that -
Oh...PAO Apollo Control Houston here. 29 hours 59 minutes and momentarily we should acquire the spacecraft via Hawaii and hear more about how the rendezvous went. Here goes the first call.
[Garble]. Isn't that pretty? That thing...
Apollo 7, Houston over Hawaii. [Pause]
Go, man.
Roger, we're in station with it. About 150 out. It's - and tumbling in almost any random direction.Go ahead. [Pause]
Roger. Understand. [Pause]
It looks like the fourth SLA panel finally deployed fully. [Pause]
We got acme poor COMM this time, Walt. We stand by a little bit until we get in a little closer. [Pause]
Roger. Do you understand we are in stationkeeping with the S-IVB? [Pause]
I guess he doesn't (laughter).
Roger. We copy stationkeepings. [Long pause]
He did. Good.
Wow!
Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read now.
Loud and clear, Jack. Go.
Okay. You are real fine now, Walt; we have jast switched to S-band. [Pause]
Okay. This is Donn. Everything was pretty nominal as far as the solutions vere concerned. We had a DSKY solution of 3.6 to the midcourse, and Walt had a 1.7 solution on his charts. We split the difference and did 2 feet per second aft and then slid us riht in there; and except for a little hit of cross plane correction that Wally had to make at the tail end, we were nominal right up the pike. According to NOUN 40 estimates of fuel use, we used 76 feet per second. However, NONU 40 integrates velocity even when you are not thrusting, so I think we used somewhat less than that, probabaly on the order of 60 to 65 feet per second. [Long pause]
Roger. Copy that. [Pause]
Roger. On PCM high data, we had loss of contact with the S-IVB just prior to TPI; and in the confusion here, I didn't, get high bit rate data. The TPI burn - we hnd high bit rate data in the midcourse burn and the final RCS trusting on it. [Long pause]
Okay. Copy that. [Pause]
And, Walt, I have your separation PAD whenever you are ready to copy that. [Pause]
Wait one. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. How close are you now? [Pause]
Pretty close, at about - oh, at about 70 feet. It's tumbling rather widly, so we are starting to stay away from it. [Pause]
Roger. Understand.
Ready to copy, Jack. Go.
Okay. Separation PAD: 030 20 all balls NOUN 82 NA 1618 plus 1221 00020 30847 NOUN 48 NA 0 plus 05. Sextant star angle NA NOUN 34 NA 43, NA 359 310 000. Remarks: It will be a posigrade burn, REF, heads down using minus X thrusters; the burn will take plase in front of the booster.
The SLA panel - the SLA panel on the opposite side of one large sphere is sticking out of the engine. It does not have a flashing light? and the other three are working fine. [Long pause]
Roger. Copy.
What were the minutes on the GETI? I missed the minutes.
Okay. The minutes on GETI 20. [Pause]
Roger. Readback follows, you were little garbled at times. Check close, SEP burn 030 20 0000 1618 plus 1221 00020 30847 005. All the way down to roll, pitch, and yaw 359 310 000. Over. [Long pause]
Roger. That's correct. Did you copy the remarks?
Roger. Posigrade REF, heads down, minus X thrusters, from in front of the booster. [Pause]
Roger. And, Walt, on your charging of battery A - [Pause]
Say again.
On charging battery A, we'd like you not to stop charging - [Pause]
Say again, Jack.
Apollo 7. Do you read? Houston.
Roger. I am reading you. How me?
You're five-by.
What was your last question after mY readback? [Pause]
We do not want you to discontinue charging the battery A at .6 amps. We'll give you a cutoff charge. [Pause]
Roger. I copied below that.
You'll continue charging. We'll give you a cutoff time. [Pause]
I'll be standing by for your cutoff later.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We feel you're at the end of your tape on your DSE. If you concur, we'll take command and we'll dump it, and you can go back to your normal switch configuration. [Long pause]
Roger. We concur.
Okay. We're gonna dump.
Houston. [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
That's a real nice setup on the ground. Your solution And ours were pretty close; you did a real good job. [Pause]
You all did a real fine job, too.
Very good.
That's what we call teamwork.
Roger. That's a fact. [Pause]
Hey, Apollo 7. [Pause]
Apollo 7. Go. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Standby one.
Apollo 7, CAP COMM.
Apollo 7. Opposite omni. [Pause]
Apollo 7, CAP COMM. [Pause]
Apollo 7. Go.
Roger. Congratulations on a great job up there.
Thank you; we're [garble] todays.
Yes, listen; we need commitment on REV 45 and sub relative to TV from here on. [Pause]
Roger. We'll go along with that. We were awfully busy up here and behind when we started out this morning; we had to cut you off. [Pause]
Roger. Okay. And you are okay from 45 on. Is that correct? [Pause]
Yes, it is.
Okay. Fine. Thank you.
Real job, but we did them all withiw the period, and. the range really came up beautiful today. [Pause]
Roger. Okay. Have fun. We will see you later. [Pause]
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston. You are 1 minute L0S Texas; we will pick you up at TananariYe in 34 minutes. [Pause]
Roger. Ready to go.
Roger.
I know it will take awhile for you to dump that tape give us a call if you have the first tape ready. [Long pause]
Okay, 7. It's gonna take a little while to get the tape dumped. EECOM will let us know when they're ready, and we'll tell you when you can use it again.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. [Pause]
Roger,
Roger. Your voice is pretty, good this time. Between your chow there, I've got t block data number 4 to give you. [Long pause]
Ready to copy, Go. [Pause]
Say again. You are ready to copy?
Go ahead. [Pause]
Roger. 021 dash 4 Alpha plus 260 minus 1633 032 plus 53 plus 42 4933, 022 dash 3 Bravo plus 317 plus 1388 034 plus 13 plus 54 4523, 023 dash 3 Alpha plus 295 plus 1385 035 plus 49 plus 27 4775, 024 dash 3 Bravo plus 233 plus 1356 037 plus 24 plus 28 5013, 025 dash Alpha Charlie minus 021. Wait one, skipped GET: 038 plus 14 plus 11 4342.
Apollo 7, Houston. On your longitude for area 25 Alpha Charlie. [Pause]
Area 25 Alpha Charlie, I got lat minus 021 and no longitude. [Pause]
Roger. Longitude minus 0180. Area 026 dash Alpha Charlie plus 090 minus 0240 039 plus 49 plus 27 4159. Houston, over. [Long pause]
Roger. Houston. 021 dash 4 ALta plus 260 minus 1633 032 plus 53 plus 42 4933, 022 dash 3 Bravo, and I didn't get plus or minus on this, 317 plus 1388 034 plus 13 plus 54 4523. [Long pause]
Roger. Your lattitude is...
023 dash 3 Alpha plus 295 plus 1385 035 plus 49 plus 27 4775, 024 dash 3 bravo plus 233 plus 1356 037 plus 024 plus 28 5013, 025 dash Alpha Charlie minus 021 0180 038 plus 14 plus 11 4342, 026 dash Alpha Charlie plus 490 minus 0240 039 plus 49 plus 27 4159. over. [Long pause]
Roger. Your lattitude on area 223 Bravo is 2 plus 317. [Pause]
[Garble] everything else correct.
Everything up correct. [Long pause]
Just about LOS there, Wally. You and. Donn, we would like to have you do some troubleshooting on the BIOMED harness there when you get a chance, and maybe we can pick it up over Mercury. [Long pause]
Roger. [Garble] rendezvous. [Pause]
Roger.
[Garble] around. If you get a readouts we'd like to hear hov much RCS propellant we have left [garble]. [Long pause]
Affirmative. Go.
[Garble] Do you have it for us? [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston. I have a flight plan update. [Pause]
Roger. Wait one. [Pause]
Should we use the flight plan, or do we need the log book? [Pause]
Say again, Walt.
Did you plan to use the flight plan, or do we need the log book?
No, it's just one line. At time 33 30, the fuell cell purge of the O2 only. [Long pause]
Purge the O2 only of the fuell cell purge, and it has to be checked at the scheduled time. Right? [Pause]
Roger. It's at the same time, at 33 30. [Long pause]
It's duly noted. [Pause]
Round up to date due on our window status, the center hatch window nov is pretty badly blurred, I would say, useful only to detect the horizon. [Long pause]
Roger. You say it's hard to detect the horizon? [Pause]
Negative. It is just barely usable for detecting the horizon, rather than, looking through it. It would be usable for bank angles, and that's all. [Long pause]
Roger.
My left window, what I call my number 1 window - [Pause]
Roger.
- is now developing a film on the inner surface of the outer pane. [Long pause]
Althou it's not too bad at at this point, I would not shoot pictures through it. [Pause]
Roger. Copy.
I'll go on around the cockpit. The number 2 window, the one we use for rendezvous, is beautifull. And interestingly enough, small hairs like a fuzz, around the perimeter of all the windows that apparently just developed as a sort of dust, it's about three-quarters of an inch to an inch long. [Long pause]
Roger. Is that on all windows ow just the - [Pause]
That's on all windows, and I'm now over to number 4 window. It does have the same dust, and it's getting a little bit cloudy but only around the perimeter on the upper right corner, as you would think of the upper and lower with the X-axis horizontal. [Long pause]
Tt looks like the number 4 window may occlude out after a few more days. [Pause]
Roger. Looks like number 4 may occlude out after 3 or 4 more days, right? [Pause]
Roger. Number 5, I had to cello it now - it has a slight film on the inner surace. We'll be standingh by for IFR. [Long pause]
Yes, sound like it.
Naturally, we'll keep you updated on this, and we'll discuss where we're going. [Pause]
Roger.
Affirmative. The target was visually fixed during the final stage of braking about midway between Betelgeuse and Sirius on a line drawn between the two stars. [Long pause]
Reger. Copy.
And it's a very traumatic experience.
Sounds like it vas a good one. [Pause]
We arranged for an update, and I think John Young was on a while ago, on our fuel remaining, just to give us an academic theory. [Long pause]
I'll check.
[Garble] to pass on or maybe get fixed for subsequent spacrecraft. On panel C82, the QD that we hooked to the waste water servicing valve: that QD, after it's installed, provides interference with storage area B8 such that B8 cannot be opened and gotten into without taking down the QD again. [Long pause]
Roger. [Pause]
There's something I think we ought to make note of, Ron. The lightweight headsets are preferable to the COMM carriers due to the comfort of not having anything on your head but the plugs in our ears. We're using the plastic plugs rather than the rubber type nipples. [Long pause]
You're using your own molded plastic plugs, right? [Pause]
That's affirmative. [Pause]
Roger. From our calculations on the RCS fuel down here, it looks like it was pretty much nominal. We used the nominal plus a portion of the reserve, and so you're about right on. We're standing by for a further temperature stabilization to get a more accurate picture of it. [Long pause]
Roger.
On your tape recorders as you know, we've recorded a lot of high bit rate and not too many places to dump it. It's going to take about three revs. So you'll have no voice recording on your tape recorder for while. We'll let you know when it's available for use again. [Long pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Wally, we'd like to get an indication of how you're feeling up there and if the Actifed did you any good.
Apollo 7, Houston. About 1 minute to LOS Guam. [Pause]
Roger. I didn't, give an answer on the Aetifed or aspirin. You were cut out. [Long pause]
Roger. I need to get an idea of how you feel then if the Actifed was working. Do you have any further symptoms? [Pause]
My mucous is much thicker, and I think I probably should continue on Actifed and use aspirin when I go to sleep at night.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. [Pause]
Roger. We're recording you on humidities. [Pause]
Say again.
Roger. we're - hygrometer. [Pause]
Roger. Understand. [Pause]
Go ahead. We're standing by. [Pause]
Wally. we're just a little curious if you have had any indcations of a fever at all? [Pause]
Negative. I took my temperature. It's normal, and we've done the hand-holding bit on the forehead and it just appears that the nasal passage is very full. I haven't been coughing, I There's nothing in the lungs. [Long pause]
Roger.
I'd prefer to dry it up if I could, and I believe that the decongestant is my best bet. [Long pause]
Wally.
Go.
We would like for you to go ahead and stay ou the Actifed and continue with the aspirin then. [Pause]
Roger. What's the frequency of the usage? [Pause]
Stand by.
Say again. [Pause]
The Actifed once every 8 hours. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Wally, aspirin can be as often as two every 4 hours if desired. [Pause]
Roger. Thank you for your help. [Pause]
I'll follow that schedule until we land, we run out, or I feel better. [Pause]
Pretty hard to read that time, Wally.
Roger. I'll follov that schedule until we land, run out, or feel better. [Pause]
Roger. Concur.
Huntsville LOS.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute to LOS. We'll pick you up Tananarive at 32 plus 27. [Long pause]
Roger. [Pause]
That's 32 plus 37? [Pause]
That is affirmative.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Apoll0 7, Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Apollo 7. Go ahem. [Pause]
Roger. We request you terminate battery A charging at .4 amp. [Pause]
Roger. .4 amp.
Roger. We shoved .47 amp at Guaymas. Request onboard readout this time. [Pause]
Okay. We might check on are we getting my telemetry down? [Pause]
That's a negative telemetry on that, Tananarive. [Pause]
Roger. We sorta believe we had a wire pulled out that apparently pulled out, sooner to Tananarive adition. But we'll be getting off the tape dumps beyond this pass. [Long pause]
Roger. We should be able to get some on the Mercury at about 32 plus 50. [Pause]
Understand that at 32 after we're over the hill. [Pause]
Say again, amp. [Pause]
[Garble] and reading about .5 amp. [Pause]
Roger. Copy .5. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. You might be advised that our last check on the voice quality of the DSE is still very good. [Pause]
[Garble]. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Houston, Go.
Roger. We started our ECS redundant component check about 5 minutes ago, and I brought up suit compressor 2. The AC was, prior to shutting suit compressor 1 off, and at that time, I had a half amp undervoltage on main bus A and main bus B and reset okay. [Long pause]
Roger. Understand. When you turned suit compressor 1 off, you also had a main bus A and B undervoltge, and it reset okay. [Long pause]
Affirmative.
Main [Garble] power breaking. [Pause]
I had two on at [garble] once. [Pause]
Say again, Walt.
Did. you copy?
Negative on the last statement.
Had two on at once and up on the main bus A and main bus B undervoltage. I'm currently reding 27½ volts on each main bus. [Long pause]
Roger. Understand. [Pause]
And where is the next place where I'll be able to have you verify my main reg A and B? [Pause]
Roger. We should get that at Mercury. We pick them up at 32 plus 50. [Pause]
Roger. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 7. How do you read?
Apollo 7, Houston. Loud and clear. [Pause]
If you have somebody standing by, we would like to check our main oxygen rate. [Pause]
Roger. We're receiving the data; continue. [Pause]
Okay. [Pause]
Stand by; we just lost data.
Stand by till you get data back. [Pause]
Roger. That data is back in; continue. [Pause]
Main reg B valve closed. [Pause]
Okay. We're reading 10 - 10. [Long pause]
Ro6er. We ere reading 102.
Roger. Thank you. 102. [Pause]
Main reg B valve nov is back ON. Main reg A valve OFF. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Say again.
Standing by for your reading on the other valve. [Pause]
Roger. We are reading 105.
Understand 105, thank you. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Are you reading Wally'S BIOMED now? [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Affermative. It looks good now. [Pause]
We'll work on Donn's when he wakes up. [Pause]
Exercising right now.
It's a first!
Amazing!
The CDR is exercising, you say? [Pause]
Wall's exercising. [Pause]
I think you ought to pass that on to Deke. [Pause]
I'll call him on the phone. [Long pause]
Apollo, Houston. Number one surgeon certainly appreciates your efforts there. [Pause]
Roger. The lead came apart, apparently. [Pause]
Roger. We understand. [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7. The ECS redundant component check is complete; we did not close secondary radiators. [Long pause]
Roger. Understand. Did not close secondary radiators. [Pause]
Also wonder if - how long we want to go with the primary boilers without trying it and possibly reservicing it? [Pause]
Roger. Looks like right now we're going to work on that maybe on the next shift; I don't knov. On tomorrow. You have 1 minute LOS; be advised turn up your S-band volume at 33 plus 09. We w'll have a - S-band pass over Hawaii. [Long pause]
33 plus 09.
Hey, Ron. This is Wallly.
Go.
Do you have enough time to agree to bring the TV up? [Pause]
I'm getting an update on the time, and I'll pass it up later. [Pause]
Roger.
Roger. What is the time for the next TV pass and we will turn our S-band volume up till there would, be a lock-on on Hawaii. [Pause]
Roger. Concur.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Loud and clear. I understand.
Hey, sounds beautiful.
Very good. [Pause]
And now would you give us an ascending node update? A chart update? [Pause]
Roger. Stand by. I don't have one right now. Give you one shortly.
No rush.
And be advised on the TV usage; it's about 71 plus 40. [Pause]
Okay. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. There is your nodal update. [Pause]
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. REV 21, GET is 32 plus 40 plus 09. Longitude 71.1 east, right ascension 0618. [Pause]
Roger. We have that. Thank you. [Long pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We will have a handover to Huntsville at 33 plus 16, so stand-by for S-band volume decrease slightly before that. [Long pause]
Hawaii here, Apollo 7. [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Houston. Go. [Pause]
Wally, did you copy that at 33 16 we will switch to Huntsville? And that S-Band will break lock at that time? [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Houston, Apollo y, Houston. Do you re_ [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
[Garble]. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Roger. Ron, 7. Go.
Roger. We are back in VHF again. Missed your last comments on S-band. [Pause]
Roger. We have had LMP back on BIOMED as per flight plan. [Pause]
Roger. We confirm.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute AOS Tananarive 34 plus 03.
Huntsville LOS.
Apollo 7, Houston. Tananarive standing by.
Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read? Over.
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Roger. we have the instrument meter readouts for you if you have got time to take them. [Pause]
Roger. we have 1 minute to LOS. [Pause]
Forget it.
Roger. We'll check you on Mercury at 34 plus 25.34 + 25.
Apollo 7, Houston - Mercury. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Hey, Ron, vould you identify a filter for us please? [Garble]. [Pause]
Which one?
Serial number 1002, and the number on the other side, Sugar Easy Baker 33100050 dash 206. Over. [Long pause]
Roger. What was your request on this?
Want you to verify if that ts the 2A filter, the filter that is called out as 2A in our documentation. That is the only labeling on tis filter. [Long pause]
Roger. A filter you say? [Pause]
A filter for the 70 mm Hasselblad. Over. [Pause]
Roger. Copy now. [Long pause]
Walt, we would like some onboard reading: your battery charger current, and the Service Module RCS propellant quantities. [Long pause]
Battery current is still reading .5 amp, and I vould like to know what you have on it, and I will read you the onboard quantities in the Service Module RCB propellant. [Long pause]
Quad A is shoving 58 percent. Quad B is still at 93 percent where we launched at. Quad C is 65 percent. Quad D is showing about 68 percent. Over? [Long pause]
Roger. We copy, and we are reading .43 on the battery charger current. [Pause]
Roger. I will continue charging, and I am still reading .5 down the line, and you can give me a call when they cease charging. [Pause]
Roger. Will do.
Apollo 7, Houston. Do you want your temperature corrected onboard readout for the RCS? [Pause]
Affirmative. Please go with it.
Roger. Alpha five six - disregard. Bravo Charle six one and Delta is six four. [Long pause]
Five six six one six four. I have all the service test meter readouts. Are you interested in any of them in particular? I have them logged in the flight plan. [Long pause]
I will give you the RCS - comnand module RCS temperatures anyway. That is five C and D and six A, B, C, and D, all five modes except 60 C and 64.6. [Long pause]
Roger. We copy, and we would like the battery pressure if yon have it available. And, Walt, S-band volume up at 34 plus 44. [Long pause]
.4 volts, and it seems to be in a standard position. We check it before we make a urine dump, and it goes right dovn to .6 volts; and soon as you close the dump, it goes right back up to 1.4. [Long pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7. Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7. Loud and clear.
Roger. Loud and clear. You're coming down, down. Voice back up now. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Wally, we'd like to select Po at your convenience just to update the state vector. [Long pause]
Houston, ao you read [garble]?
Apollo 7, affirmative.
Roger. Do you want us to give [garble]. [Pause]
Say again. A little garbled that time.
We'd like to give you an update, We'd like to put the sextant calibration test when we call for 36 hours and 30 minutes into Dolm Eisele's wake period. [Long pause]
Roger. Sextant calibration test. We'll see if we can't move that into Donn, wake period. [Pause]
Thank you. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We're still looking on that dash 206 filter to determine which one it is. [Pause]
Roger. It's showing red; it's not green. We're hoping it's 2A. [Pause]
Roger.
Clear coil filter. It's one of those last little things thrown at us before we launched.
One minute to LOS. We're getting a lot of static on the ground down here. I was just wondering if you're getting it. [Pause]
say again. [Pause]
You are.
Go ahead. [Pause]
Ron, would you say again?
Roger. We're receiving a lot of static on the ground. Are you receiving any at all? [Pause]
Negative. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo - Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
This is Apollo 7. Do you ready
Roger. The dash 206 filter is the 2 Alpha filter, and it should be clear, hopefully. [Pause]
Say again.
Roger. The dash 206 filter is the 2 Alpha, 2A filter. [Pause]
Roger. Thank you. I have one question on potable water. We are scheduled to chlorinate at this time, and we have a completely full tank. OVer. [Long pause]
This tank has been full for some time, Ron. And it came up several months baek, there is a question as to how much ullage volume you have to have in the top of that tank before you chlorinate. I'm kind of concerned about the fact that the chlorination that we put in yesterday is probably still in that tank. [Long pause]
Roger. We understand your problem, and we'll get the word to you shortly here.
Okay.
CapCom, will you tell them that [garble].
We will wait till you get an answer.
Say again, Wally. Oh, I unerstand. We'll delay till we get an answer. [Pause]
CapCom from Flight. [Long pause]
Apollo 7. Houston. We are reading .41 on the battery charger, and you can terminate charging Battery A. [Long pause]
Understand. Stop charging, .41 amp. [Pause]
Affirmative.
I am still reading .5 on board.
Houston, Apollo 7. Over.
Houston. Go. [Pause]
Go ahead, Walt.
Roger. I show that we've probably been charging battery A now for about 7 hours. Is that consistent with putting the energy back that we took out during Boost and both SPS burns? Over. [Long pause]
Walt, took out 9.3, and looks like we put in about 4.5 hours.we put in about 4.5 hours.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We'd like to send a P27 update request accept, and I have a NAV check to give you. [Long pause]
Ready for NAV check. [Pause]
NAV check 036 15 4 balls plus 1875 plus 16885 1271. Read back. [Long pause]
Roger. Understand. 615 4 balls plus 1875 16885 1271. Over. [Long pause]
Roger. I didn't get your readback on the hours. 036 hours 15 minutes. [Long pause]
Ro6er. It's just the three. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. I've got some update for you on the RCS calculated quantities and your profile from battery status if you want to copy. [Long pause]
Roger. Did you read our readback on the NAV check okay? Go with your info on the RCS quantity and that update. [Long pause]
Roger. This will be an update on figure 3 dash 1 on your RCS profile. At 36 hours, you have 820 pounds. [Long pause]
Roger. Thirty-six hours, 820 pounds.
And your RCS ground calculated quantities are, in order, 56 percent, 63 percent, 47 percent, 63 percent. [Long pause]
Roger. I read 56, 63, 47, 63, and the total quantity again 8 [garble]. [Long pause]
Roger. Your total quantity is 820 pounds.

Thank you. [Garble]. [Pause]
Say again, Walt.
Roger. At 36 hours into the flight, what number do I go on my chart? [Pause]
Roger. You are going in 820 pounds, 820 pounds. [Pause]
Eight hundred and twenty pounds, and I copied 634767 [garble]. [Pause]
All right. Roger. Say it again? 56634763? [Pause]
Roger. Thank you. [Pause]
And your battery status? [Pause]
Say again.
Your battery status in ampere hours. [Pause]
Roger.
Bat A, 35.2; B, 30.4; C, 39.5.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Did you copy battery status last pass? [Pause]
Stand by. Roger. I had 35.6, 30.4 I think it was, and 39 somthing, Ron. It looks to me like we didn't fill up battery A again, and is aaybody giving consideration to do a second recharge of that battery some other time in the flight? [Long pause]
Well, that is a possibility. We wanted to cut it off at the .4 limit though - just to - so we wouldn't get into overcharge type of problem we were talking about before launch. And we are working on it now, and we can't really come up with an answer at the present time. We'll work on it and let you know. And Walt, I have a Lima Sierra update for you.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. I have a Lima Sierra update. [Pause]
[Garble] very weak.
Roger. Lima Sierra update.
Stand by. [Pause]
Go ahead.
Roger. Lima Sierra 074 slach 051. [Pause]
Roger. 074 slash 051. [Long pause]
T, Houston. One minute until LOS. Be advised Air Force 26, Navy 20. [Long pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Sorry about that.
Welcome to the club.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Go ahead.
Roger. On the water chlorination: about 8 ounces of water, then chlorinate. [Pause]
We got you clear for that one.
Roger. I have a flight plan update. Ready to cupy? [Long pause]
[Gable]. Go. [Pause]
Roger. Flight plan update 38 plus 40: delete MCC update , 39 plus 40: do option 3 vice option 2. Forty plus 10: cancel rendezvous NAV at 8 ... 80 nautical miles. Forty-one plus 00: waste water dump. Forty-two plus 35: sextant calibration previously scheduled at 39 plus 35. Over.
Roger. Over. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. S-band volume up at 37 plus 36. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, CapCom. [Pause]
Go ahead.
Hey, Wally, Deke here. We're not being recorded for a change. Just wanted to know how you felt about shuffling this sleep cycle around a little bit. Kind of looks to me at least - and speak up if you don't like the sound of it - but we have got a hell of a lot lost motion here when you might better be getting a little rest. [Long pause]
We are getting kind of pooped, and I think that is why we started off the way we did today. [Garble] needed the sleep more than we did. [Long pause]
You are very garbled. We're unable to read you. [Pause]
Roger. Donn is sleeping now, and he needed the sleep more than we did. [Long pause]
Roger. Understand that. I guess the question I am asking is whether you have got any allergy at all that All three to you knocking it off for a while. [Long pause]
Let's stick another daf with it and [garble]. [Pause]
Okay. We only have about 30 seconds left in thts pass. Why don't you think about it, and Tom or Ron will talk to you about it again over Guamas. [Pause]
Roger.Copy.
Apollo, Apollo 7. This is Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
What do you say there, Tom?
Roger. Wally, real good rendezvous you pulled off today. [Pause]
Yes,that's a little more traumatic than that other bird we used to fly. [Pause]
Understand. We were talking down here, and we'd like to discuss free flight [garble] period of time about looking ahead in the flight plan, about the possibility of you all going all three crewmen on the sleep cycle. I just want to discuss it for down the line, what Deke was trying to say. What do you think about it? [Long pause]
I don't think I'd be afraid to do it on another flight, but we're kind of reluctant right now. [Pause]
Okay.
The machine is working real well, Tom. [Pause]
I was looking at all the block data about 40 hours and also waste water dump at 41, and it's kind of quiet time after that for another 4 or 5 hours. [Long pause]
Very good. This IVA is no problem at All. In fact, it is an asset. [Pause]
Okay.
All the problem we worried about the spacecraft picking up motions from the crew, no such tbing. We can knock around the capsule like mad. You get to be quite a gymnast. [Long pause]
I want to ask you a question. How are the sleep bags working out? [Pause]
Not so hot.
Okay.
You miss the 1 g lying down. With the seat belts resisting, you are held down, and you feel better controlled and better contained, I guess. Sleeping bag, you try to find a place to stick your head or your arm to hold on. [Long pause]
Our analysis is the couch is probably a little better than the sleep bag. [Pause]
That is correct.
Okay.
We find the lightweight headsets are preferable to COMM carriers, too. [Pause]
Right. Reviewed the flight plan here. Understand when you went to the lightweight headsets - [Pause]
Yes. The cables for the COMM carrier is very objectionable and jabs you in the neck and the shoulder and keeps pulling your head around. [Pause]
All right. [Pause]
We are not at all hangry by the way. We are trying to get some exercise to keep ourselves going. That Exer-Genie's a heck of a good deal. [Long pause]
Works out real good in zero g? [Pause]
Hate to admit that, but it is probably one of the best spacy things we have had in years. [Pause]
Okay. Okay. On the sleep thing, Wally, it is strictly your option, obviously. We just got to thitnking maybe it will work out better, give you a little more, longer aessisons of it. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead.
We don't think we ought to SYNC Hasselblat here; We may be able to take one a little later. [Pause]
Roger. Understand about the camera. [Pause]
Hey, Tom. I would like to log some photographs here on magazine Q, starting the same [garble] the same [garble]. We started shooting about over the Red Sea, and we are continuing up to frame 12 right now. [Long pause]
Okay. We were recording, and we have it, Walt. Thank you. [Pause]
When are we going to get our tape recorders back? I see it is in motion now. Will we ever finish dumping all the tapes on the rendezvous run? [Pause]
Not yet, Walt. We are still dumping. [Pause]
Okay. We would like to get a GO as soon as we get that through. [Pause]
Roger. We will let you know as soon as it is finished.
Houston, Apollo 7. Over.
Go ahead, 7, Houston. [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. We go. [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7. Over. [Long pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, this is Houston. Go ahead. [Pause]
Roger. Tom, do you know if they ever got the voice dump right after [garble] the east end we put our comments on about the tape, and I'm not sure if they dumped [garble]. [Long pause]
Apollo 7. We'll check on it. [Pause]
Thank you, Tom.
Apollo 7, Houston. Will you give us opposite omny? [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Will you give us opposite omny? [Pause]
I heard the boys in the back room talking. You got it now. [Pause]
Roger. Apollo 7, Houston. It's talking quite a while to get all the voice data played back, Walt, and we won't really know for quite a while. Is there any particular GET on the voice you want us to check? [Long pause]
Roger. I know we rewound the tape at the Canaries, I think it was. I'm hoping we - right after boost, some time there about 20 minutes, I think, we put out description of [garble] by the tape and someplace the first hour [garble].
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. First made [garble] turns out from lift-off until Canaries, and because of rewind and eVerjghing, we do not have that on voice. [Pause]
You don't have that, huh?
Okay. When we get the tape back, we'll probably try to put some on it.
Okay. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We are about - we're close to LOS, and you gonna have the tape back. We've just about finished all the rendezvous dump. [Pause]
Roger. Thank you. We've just finished chlorinating the water again. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, this is Houston. We have aquisition at Redstone. [Long pause]
Roger, Houston. Loud and clear.
Apollo 7 Houston. Opposite omni, please.
Apollo 7, Houston. Would you give us the opposite omny now? [Pause]
Roger. That's back where we started. Is that where you want? [Pause]
Yes. You switched about the same time we say to switch, so ...
Apollo 7, Houston. Have 1 minute to LOS at Redstone. [Pause]
Roger.
At about 38, 8 minutes and 30 seconds, I spotted a satellite passing through the Southern Cross - at varying degrees. [Long pause]
I observed it by reflected light.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7, stanading by. [Long pause]
Roger. Read you about four-by, Wally.
Roger, we're reading you weak, too.
That's the time [garble]. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. You are comming garbled. Say again. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Say again, please. [Long pause]
Roger. Out. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Now reading you loud and clear, Wally. You happen to be in an attitude, and you have the camera available. There is a good area that we haven't had many pictures in. It's at 38 56 30, the upper end of the Persian Gulf down and to the right. If you have some time and camera, is fine; if not, no problem. [Long pause]
Roger. Say again the target.
Roger. The upper end of the Persian Gulf. It will occur in 38 56 30. [Pause]
[Garble]. [Pause]
okay. [Long pause]
Houmton, Apollo 7. Do you read?
Go ahead.
Roger [garble] night air glov 240 degrees [garble] all - almost all over the horizon an we sweep low. [Garble] . [Long pause]
Okay. You say all around the horizon, Wally? [Pause]
That's right, on the night sky.
Roger.
[Garble] Sirius came up [garble]. [Pause]
okay.
Hello, Apollo 7, Houston. Just looking at the DSKY. Are you pitched down about 90 degrees? [Pause]
That is affirm. Camera all ready.
Roger. Well, we have about 1 minute until LOS with Ascension, Wally, and we will catch you next time over the Pacific. [Pause]
Okay.
At 38 hours 48 minutes into the flight, we're taking color pictures Over Africa; magazine Q. These are up around frame 6. There's a beautiful shot of a crater. It might be Tabol.
At 38:50:35, got another picture of Africa. It's [garble].
LMP took one Actifed at 39 hours into the flight.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
This is Apollo 7. How do you read. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Apollo 7. How do you read? [Pause]
I am reading you about three by-three. I had a block data, but I will give it to you over Guam, in a few minutes - about 5 minutes. [Long pause]
That is a block data over Guam.
Video strength in clear. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]

ApOllo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston.
ADollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7. Go.
Roger. I have block data. Are you ready to copy? [Pause]
Stand by one. [Long pause]
Houston, go ahead [garble] could you call and stand by. [Pause]
Are you ready? [Pause]
Okay. Go ahead. I got it now.
Roger. 027 dash 2 Bravo plus 206 minus 02514 041 26 13 4104, 028 dash 2 Bravo plus 277 minus 0288 043 02 05 4193. 029 dash 1 Bravo plus 240 minus 0633 044 27 52 4158, 030 dash 1 Alpha plus 297 minus 0662 046 03 34 42146,031 dash 1 Bravo plus 317 minus 0662 047 39 29 4430 032 dash 1 Alpha plus 291 minus 0662 049 15 09 4650. Coming up on LOS.
Roger. Understand. I read back later then. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Roger, Houston.
Roger. Apollo 7, Houston. Ready for your readback on block data when you are ready. [Pause]
Roger. Stand by. I am right in the middle of a P52. Will be with you in a second.
Roger.
Sorry, Houston. I am ready with the readback.
Roger. Go. [Pause]
Roger. Area 0272 Bravo plus 06 minus 0254 041 2613 410, 28 dash 2 Bravo plus 277 minus 0288 043 02 05 4193, 029 dash 1 Bravo plus 240 minus 0633 044 2752 4128, 30 dash 1 Alpha plus 297 minus 0662 046 0334 4246, 031 dash 1 Bravo plus 317 minus 0662 047 3929 4430, 32 dash 1 Alpha plus 291 minus 0662 049 1509 4650.
Roger. Copy readback. Check one item on the third block: 029 dash 1 Bravo; second entry, plus 240. [Long pause]
Roger. Plus 240.
Roger. Read-back is correct. And Also 2A advisory: we had good voice quallity on the Redstone dump that we got on the last pass. [Long pause]
All very good. I got a couple of small items for you. Wally took a couple of aspirin and an Actifed, and he only took one Actifed. Walt took one Actifecl only. He feels fine. He has just got a little stuffy head cold, and I put some nose grease in mine because my nostrils are a little dry - because it smells good. [Long pause]
Roger. Understand. Wally took two aspirins and one Actifed, and Donn took one Actifed, and you took some nosedrops was it or cream? [Long pause]
Nose cream. It is a fluid they gave us in two tubes. Walt is the one that took the Actifed, not Donn. [Pause]
Oh, okay, Donn. Sorry.
Yes. Log us about 16 clicks of water here in the last 45 mtnutes or so. [Long pause]
Okay. And that is Donn.
Right.
Okay. [Pause]
You can tell them I had two good solid 7 hours of very good sleep and feeling great. [Pause]
Roger. Thank you. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We would like the BIOMED to number 1. [Long pause]
Understand. And I will do that after I - after I do this aligment. Does that mean you want to [garble] test counts? [Pause]
Roger. We lost the downlink on the BIOMED, and this is just to see if it's actually the circuit Or in the BIOMED harness. [Long pause]
Roger. I will do that in a couple of minutes. [Pause]
Okay. Fine. We have about one and a half minutas to LOS. [Pause]
You mean I get until next pass to secure this alignmet.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Canary. [Pause]
Roger, Houston. [Long pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. About 2 minutes LOS Canary. Next acquisition will he Redstone at 41 plus 17. That will be about 1 hour. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, this is Houston. [Pause]
Go ahead, Tom.
Roger. Donn, did you get P52 finished? [Pause]
Yes. I did it two or three times.
Roger.
Turned out fine.
Good show. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We have about 30 seconds to LOS. [Pause]
Okay. LOS. [Garble] take about one half hour [garble]. [Pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston through the Redstone. Over. [Pause]
Roger, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Donn, reading you about three-by. I want to check a couple of items. Have they performed the waste water dump that was scheduled for around 41 hours? [Pause]
Negative, Tom. We're going to wait until it gets to about 90 percent. That way we won't have to do it so often. [Pause]
Okay. Spec-1, we're going to give you the MC - we're going to send you an MCC update previously scheduled for 44 40 at 44 hours. [Long pause]
Roger. Understand. [Pause]
And we're planing the S-IVB tracking previously scheduled at 46 10. It will now be at 44 36. You should have a good update vectored on that, and the S-IVB will be at about 170 nautical miles. [Long pause]
Okay. Tom, how [garble] as soon as I get them, I'm going to write them down, and then you can give it to me a little later. [Long pause]
Roger.
Tom, are you still there? [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go. Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. We've just completed the 23 sextant calibrations. I think that your data [garble] is downrange. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We're about 1 minute to LOS, and you're starting to fade out. I understand you've completed the sextant calibration. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Did you experience a restart a couple of minutes ago? [Pause]
I experieced a restart during part of program 52 that I was using to find some stars I needed, I think it happened - it happened once before, the other day - when you go from zero optics to CMC and also hit the feed and you haven't waited 15 seconds. It's a procedural error, and it's just a momentary restart, almost program alarm. [Long pause]
Okay. [Pause]
Incidentaly, I have an O2 FLOW HI light. I suspect it's the same problem we had earlier - sensor failure. I haven't had time to troubleshoot it is sure yet, though. [Pause]
Okay. We'll pick you up - about 15 seconds to LOS, and we'll pick you up over the Canaries.onds to LOS and we'll pick you up over Canary's.
This is CDR with ATC high light. I suspect the same problem we had earlier. Except that I hadn't had time to [garble].
Alright.
Time, 41:34; I'd like to record the results of the P23 sextant calibration test. On this test I used Canopus as the bright star and Rigel as the dim star. Unfortunately, there wasn't any third star within the field of view of Canopus, but I just went ahead and put Canopus at the center reticles for the only other star we could get to, and that's Rigel. I started the P23 as per checklist, and [garble]. The only comment I have is that it's a rather tedious, timeconsuming, and fuel-costly procedure, and the benefits we gain by it, I don't think, justify it.
The trunnion bias check: when it was first displayed, NOUN 87 - P23 came up with 00000.
The second NOUN 87 which is the shaft and trunnion one - I had the two stars superimposed - was plus 29188, plus 1764 - correction plus 17674. The time was 41 hours 24 minutes into the flight.
At 41 hours 37 minutes, I'd like to record a fecal elimination. It took place about 40:45. My experience is about the same as Cunningham's. It's not too bad, if you take your time. I did strip down, took underwear off to do it. It's a process of hooking - reconnecting the BIOMED afterwards. I could only get one of the little screw-in plugs to stay up.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
Houston, Go.
Houston, Apollo 7. Go.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 7. Go.
Roger. In reference to the water dump: we're reading 70 percent now, predicting a 90-percent level at approximately 45 hours but no later than 46 hours. We'll have to dump at that time. It's right in the middle of a sleep period. Suggest dumping as soon as you can in order to prevent interrupting them in the middle of their sleep cycle. [Long pause]
Roger. I got you, Bill. They're already asleep, and the way we've got it rigged, it won't disturb either one of them. So I'd just as soon wait till 45 hours. [Long pause]
Okay.
Good thinking. Bill, could you give me those flight plan updates that Tom called awhile ago? I was right in the midle of a G&N exercise and didn't get to write it down. [Pause]
Okay. I'll start talking. I have about a minute and 15 seconds. Okay. At 44 hours, we will give you the MCC update previously scheduled for 44 plus 40. [Long pause]
Roger.
Okay. At 44 plus 36, perform S-iVB traking. That was previously scheduled ut 46 plus 10. At that time - this new time - the S-IVB will be at 169 nautical miles. The last item, at 45 plus 30, delete P52 IMU realign.
Roger, understand, delete the P52 IMU realign. You want us to do a fine align at that time?
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger, Houston, go. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Roger, Houstou. Go ahead.
Roger. How far did you copy on the flight plan update. [Pause]
Stand by [garble]. [Long pause]
I think I got it all, Bill. I've got the S-IVB tracking at 44 36 instead of 46 hours and delete the P52 realignment at 45 30. [Long pause]
Roger. That completes the flight plan update. I have a couple of items. We're still monitoring an O2 FLOW HI, check waste dump closed. Second item: we'd like BIOMD CMP. Okay. We're monitoring it now. Forget the BIOMED; it's okay. [Long pause]
Okay. Are you getting anything on me?
Yes, we are.
Okay. You're only getting half of it. One of those little plugs, I can't make up. I'll try again later to get it to plug in. [Pause]
Okay. [Pause]
I did have the waste vent open now, but I don't think that interferes with the O2 FLOW HI. [Pause]
Roger. Understand. It was open.
Roger. It was open for a little while there. It was stowage compartment. However, I've still got the O2 FLOW HI, and I just turned the vent off. [Long pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Cabin pressure looks normal. I suspect it's still a sensor problem. [Pause]
Okay. We're watching it. We have about 6 more minutes here. [Pause]
Okay. Any help you can give me on that, I'd appreciate it.
Roger. We'll keep you informed.
Apollo 7, Houston. We have about 2 minutes to Los Canaries. Your O2 manifold is dropping off. It's dropped from .96 to .74 in the last few minutes - O2 flow. [Long pause]
Okay. O2 flow.
Right.
Roger. I'm seeing the same thing. My onboard procedure leads me to believe it's still a failing sensor. Do you confirm that? [Long pause]
Bill, what do you have down there for O2 tank pressure? Mine is reading low - about 840. [Pause]
Okay. Stand by. [Pause]
Correction. Number 2 is reading low. Number 1 is about 860. [Long pause]
Coming up on LOS, you have 876 and 853 in one and two, and 846 in the surge tank. [Long pause]
Okay. Is that all right with everybody down there?
I think so. Stand by.
I guess you would tell me if it was not.
Roger. That's good.
[Garble] everybody [garble]. [Pause]
We'll need the S-band volume up for our Honeysucle pass at 42 plus 32. [Pause]
Roger. I'll change it.
Thank you.

Houston, Apollo 7. Go.
Roger. Reference the O2 Flow Hi. Analysis here indicates your O2 flow high. Indication on board was valid; at the time, you had 5.0 cabin pressure when the waste vent was open. Upon closing, the pressure gradually increased to 5.1. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Do you still have an O2 FLOW HI? [Pause]
Negative. Down to normal now.
Okay. One other item, the waste water dump. Recomend dumping 85 percent instead of 90 percent. They're not sure it's safe to wait till 90 percent due to possibility of overboard drain freeze. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Is the commander's and the LMP's cobra cable unconnected? Verify that it is not connected. [Long pause]
Roger. They're not connected up here. They're off of it.
Thank you very much. Also I have a - disregard. [Pause]
Say again.
Disregard.
Hey, Bill, would you log me 12 clicks from the water gun? [Pause]
Roger, 12 clicks from the water gun.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Redstone; Antigua at 43 plus 10. [Pause]
Roger [garble]. You got the [garble] okay.
Roger. 43 plus 10. You got the night shift, eh? [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up on LOS. I will have a flight plan update. Just a couple of items at Antigua.
Houston, Apollo 7. Go Antigua.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7. Go ahead.
Roger. I have a couple of things for flight plan update. [Pause]
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. Fuel ceil O2 purge at 45 plus 30. That's over Carnarvon. [Long pause]
Roger. Fuel cell O2 purge at 45 plus 30. [Pause]
Roger. And just as a matter of information, have you checked any of the G&N control modes? [Long pause]
Roger. We've used - maneuvered manually and DAP half degree per second and our deadband; we've done auto maneuvers, auto trip maneuvers, and same deadband; and I also used the minimum impulse controller in the LEB. [Long pause]
Roger. Five degrees per second, minimum deadband, auto trim, minimum deadband, and a minimum impulse controller in the LEB. [Pause]
Roger.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. Co. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Apollo 7. Houston.
There is a high pitched interference noise coming over VHF. Have you got any idea what it is? Are you picking it up down there?
High pitched interference on VHF negative. Stand by. [Pause]
Donn, this is about the same place last night where you picked up the music. [Pause]
There's some music along here, too. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. The NET is looking at it.
Okay. It's gone now.
Houston, Apollo 7. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Roger. I've got a hydrogen purge scheduled here at 44 hours. Do you want me to do that, or are we doing that just on demand, so to speak? [Pause]
Negative. That one has been deleted.
That's what I thought.
That's the hydrogen purge - fuell cell purge - at 44 hours. That has been deleted. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We will be giying you a CSM and S-IVB state vector update over Carnarvon. We will reqire ACCEPT when you get to Carnarvon, and we're estimating AOS Carnarvon at 43 plus 57. [Long pause]
Apollo 7. Understand.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute till LOS at Canary. If you need contact, we have about 2 minutes S-band after that at Madrid. [Long pause]
[Garble] Apollo 7. Understand. Thank you.

Loud and clear.
Roger. If you'll go to ACCEPT, we'll send up your state vectors. [Pause]
Going to ACCEPT. [Pause]
And I have a NAV check when you are ready to copy. [Pause]
Roger.
NAV check reads: 044 03 0000 minus 2170 plus 12234 1513. [Long pause]
Roger. Could you send that one again?
Roger. NAV check: 044 03 0000 minus 2170 plus 12234 1513. Read back. [Long pause]
Roger. 044 03 0000 minus 2170 plus 12234 1513. [Long pause]
Roger. Readhaek correct.
Okay. Apollo 7, Houston. The computer is yours. We have a little less than 2 minutes LOS Carnarvon. Request S-band volume up in about 1 minute or 2 minutes.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through the Redstone. Standing by.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Redstone. Pick you up at the Bahamas in about 12 mtnutes. [Pause]
Roger. Jack, I read you a bit faint. [Pause]
You're five-by, Donn.
Apollo 7, Houston. Standing by. [Pause]
Roger. Jack, I'm doing the P20 navigation right now. [Pause]
Roger.
I'll check the target out over Texas.
[Garble] section.
Houston, this is Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Roger. The target's still visible in the sextaut here. It's not as good as it was earlier. It's a different set angle because of the bright Earth background. I see through the base line of sight, but it's still there, and you can still track it one more time. [Long pause]
Roger. I've been following your marks, Donn, and it looks like you are getting in VERBAL 649; it looks like you're getting real good marks. [Long pause]
Yes. We update this thing on the order of optics tracking rate within, I guess, a couple of minutes at the last of the [garble]. [Long pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Target's not in sight here; it was earlier, but it's... [Pause]
Say again, Donn.
Apollo 7, Houston throgh Canaries. Standing by. [Pause]
Houston. [Pause]
Roger. Go ahead, Donn. [Pause]
[Garble]. [Long pause]
I couldn't read that, Donn. You brought two-by. [Pause]
I think the spacecraft [garble]. [Long pause]
Donn, we can't quite make that out. We've got you here for about another 5 minutes, and maybe signal strength will get a little bit better.
Apollo 7, Houston. How do you, read now? [Pause]
Loud and clear, Jack.
Okay. Donn, you are a little better there on S-band. [Pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. You are about 1 minute LOS Canaries. We'll pick you up over Carnarvon in about 28 minutes. [Long pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by. [Pause]
Roger, Houston. [Long pause]
Houston, the lights are still flashing on the S-IVB. [Pause]
Roger. Copy that.
And, Donn, as we go along here toward the end of our pass, which is about another 8 minutes, we'll pick up Honeysuckle. So you'll want to turn up your S-band. [Long pause]
Okay. [Pause]
And we have Honeysuckle for about a 9 minute pass, so we'll have you for about another 16 minutes; and then you've got a long stretch without anthing. [Long pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. Go ahead. [Pause]
[Garble], Jack.
Okay. I'm sorry, Donn.
Apollo 7 Houston. You want to turn up your S-band volume? We're just about to lose you over Carnarvon. [Pause]
Roger.
And, Donn, we want to make a radio check through this backup site at Honeysuckle, just to check it out. [Long pause]
Okey, Jack. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through the Wind Site. How do you read?
Apollo 7, Houston through the Wlnd Site. How do you read? [Pause]
Weak, but clear, Jack. I'll turn the volume up.
Okay. You're loud and clear here. [Pause]
Roger. Sounds pretty good. [Pause]
Roger. Thts is a backup site there in Australia.
Understand. Jack, I've been looking at this horizon preparing for this midcourse navigation business; and at night, there just isn't any horizon that you can define in the sextant at all. There is one in the telescope, but I don't think that's accurate enough. [Pause]
Okay. [Long pause]
The airglow band - or whatever it is - rides above. The real Earth is so wide that there's no way to use it that I can see for navigation. [Pause]
Okay. We copy that. [Long pause]
Donn, can you confirm whether you did the O2 purge on the fuel cell? [Pause]
Negative. I did not. I was working the LEB. I'll do that now.
Okay. Real fine.
Okay. Apollo 7, Houston. You've 1 minute LOS. The Wind Site will pick you up over Guaymas in about 24 minutes. [Long pause]
Roger, Jack.
Apollo 7, Houston. Standing by. [Pause]
Roger, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Roger, Houston. Go.
Roger. Opposite omni, Donn, and we're reading now 87 percent on the waste quantity. We are recommending that you initiate the dumping of the waste tank. [Long pause]
Roger. Opposite omni and 87 percent waste water. We've got a good lock with this antenna. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Jack, log me 12 click of water. [Pause]
Say again. Say again, Donn. [Pause]
I said just record 12 clicks on the water gun for me. [Pause]
Okay.
ADollo 7, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Go.
Roger. You have a GO for 47 dash 1. [Pause]
Roger. GO for 47 dash 1 and log the LMP for 12 clicks on the water gun. [Pause]
Will do, and good morning.
Good morning.
Hey, Jack. So far this urine dump system has been pretty doggoned good. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. I said the urine dump system has been working beautifully so far. [Pause]
Okay. Fine. Walt, did you have the VHF off just a minute agO? [Pause]
Yes, I did. I just got up, and I hadn't turned it on yet.
Okay. Fine.
Apollo 7, Houston through Canary. Standing by.
Roger. Hey, Jack. We have yet to activate the SPS line heaters. [Pause]
Roger. Copy that. They look like they're holding real good. [Long pause]
And I'm wondering, what are we planning on doing with the preliminary water boiler? [Long pause]
Roger. Walt, we're having a meeting down here on that very subject. We'll come up to you with a procedure for activatlng that primary water boiler to take it out. [Long pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Go, Houston.
We have a flight plan update here. The landmark tracking that was planned for about 47:40 - the weather is very, very bad in those areas, and we are recommending that - we are asking you to delete that landmark tracking exercise. [Long pause]
Roger. I just did a little bit using clouds as unknown landmarks and ran through the program. Seems to work okay. I got zero updates. [Long pause]
Okay. Real fine, Donn. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We are showing the waste quantity down below 20 percent now; it looks real good to us here. [Pause]
Roger. We're shutting it off right now.
Okay. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. you're one minute LOS Canaries. I'll pick you up in about 14 minutes at Tananarive. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Tananarive; Carnarvon in about 9 minutes.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Jack, could you give us a map update?
Will do. We're working on it. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston with your map update. [Pause]
Roger. Go.
REV 29: your GET is a node of 46 plus 06 plus 31; longitude will be 129.2 degrees west; the right ascension was 06 plus 01. [Long pause]
Roger. 46 plus 06 plus 31, 129.2 west. [Pause]
Roger. That was for REV 29. You are on 30 now. [Pause]
Thank you. [Pause]
What's the news this morning? [Pause]
Give you some scores if you would like. [Pause]
Go.
Any particular ones you're interested in? [Pause]
USC, UCLA. [Long pause]
Okay. Walt, Penn State beat UCLA 21 to 6. [Pause]
Boo. [Pause]
And USC beat Stanford 27 to 24. OklahomA beat Houston 21 to 17. [Long pause]
That's a sUrPrise. [Pause]
And here is a good one. Ohio State beat Purdue 13 to 0. [Pause]
Who beat Purdue?
Ohio State. [Pause]
Eat'em up, Buckeyes.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger, Houston.
Roger. Big news in the paper today was Apollo meets with second stage. [Pause]
What was that?
That was the big news. Apollo meets with second stage, front page stuff. [Pause]
Almost makes it worth it. I tell you, you had three of us sweating up here.
Apollo 7, Houston. Do you want to turn up your S-band? We are about 1 minute LOS Carnarvon. We Will pick you up over Honeysuckle and - almost instantaneous here. [Pause]
Wilco. [Long pause]
And, Apollo 7, just continuing with the morning news - basically, the headlines this morning are all about the rendezvous. They had another heart transplant in Houston early this morning. It is going well at last report. [Long pause]
Thank you.
Have you got the Air Force-Navy score? Air Force over Navy 26 to 20, Southern Cal over Stanford, Ohio State over Purdue, Texas 26 Oklahome 20, Notre Dame beating Northwestern 27 to 7. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. I have same flight plan updates here for you when you are ready to copy. [Pause]
Roger. Wait one. The last score we got was 27 to 7. Ready to copy in a second. [Pause]
Okay.
Ready to copy. GO.
Okay. At this G&N attitudes control test over Hawaii, we want to make sure that we have the high bit rate before we start it, and we acquire Hawaii at 49 08 45. It's a little bit different than it is in the flight plan; we just wanted to make sure we had the high bit rate before we started it. And the same way with the attitude control test which is at 50 40. On REV 33, the P52 IMU realign at 51 30, we would like you to - [Long pause]
A little slower, please, Jack.
Okay. The IMU realign at 51 30, we would like you to use option 3 instead of option 2. We would like to keep the current REFSMMAT, and also we would like you to report your giro torquing angles at the conclusion of this realignment. [Long pause]
Roger. Got you. [Long pause]
Okay. The - at 52 hours to P20 navigation, sunrise will he at 52 06. This might be useful for your S-IVB tracking at 320 miles. [Long pause]
Roger. 52 06.
And that's it right now. [Pause]
Okay. I have a question here on the attitude control test. You've got high bit required 20 to 30 minutes on the G&N attitude control test. Very shortly thereafter, you have 10 to 20 minutes of G&N attitude control test. How are we going to get all that and - are they going to get all that dumped so we can have our tape back? [Long pause]
Okay. Stand by here. I'll get EECOM on that. [Pause]
Can't you get a lot of that in real time, rather than in tapes? [Pause]
Yes, we can. Stand by, Walt. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, say again. [Pause]
We didn't call.
Apollo 7, Houston through the Huntsville. [Long pause]
Two-way lock. Out of range. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through the Huntsville. Standig by.
Apollo 7, Houston through Guaymas. [Pause]
Roger, Jack. [Pause]
Roger. Donn, we'd like to get some continuing remarks on your habitability there: how things are going, your living conditions, sleep and crew condition, and things like that. And by the way, Walt, we would like to ask you how you are feeling this morning and if that one Actifed that you took helped out. [Long pause]
Roger. I took one Actifed; my nose was slightly stuffy last night, but it didn't give me any problem while sleeping. I feel fine this morning. I feel in good shape. [Pause]
Okay. Reel good news.
[Garble]. [Pause]
If you feel like you want to take any more, let us know, okay? [Pause]
Roger. All of us are somewhat concerned. We all drinking out of the same water system and everything, and we all have one cold. But Wally seems to be getting a lot better, too. [Pause]
Okay. That's real fine news.
In general, it's been going reel well up here. It's reasonably comfortable: air temperature is fine, the humidity is fine. We're just perking along; and with a little extra time, everybody is in pretty good shape. Little exercise now and then so everybody is in good shape. [Long pause]
Okay. That's fine.
I got 7 solid hours of sleep last night; and Walt just had about six, and he's up Wally's still asleep. [Pause]
Okay. That's fine.
As far as humidity goes, I'd say it's relatively comfortable in here. Several things - small things we've noticed along the way, but most of the things we've worked out ahead of time, it looks like. [Long pause]
Okay. Copy.
I feel very strongly on the sleeping bit. The sleeping bag is not as good to have the shoulder harness and lap belt to strap you down against something, and I think we all feel kinda that way. [Long pause]
Okay. Copy that. [Pause]
Other than that, I think it is rather amazing how well and quickly we all been able to adjust to IVA. [Long pause]
Okay.
You might log that - from my personal observation at least - that there's far too much sweet in the diet, and I feel like we have more food than we need. I think Wally feels the same way. Donn seems to be eating most of his, though. [Long pause]
Okay. [Pause]
I would suspect that in another couple of days I'm probably just going to skip a whole meal in order to keep up with him. [Pause]
Okay. Copy. [Pause]
Another comment is that the exerciser is very, very good thing to make you feel better up here. I find that after we're up here - about the midle of the first day - we started noticing that your lower abdominal muscles seem to be a little sore. Always floating around in this seat position, and there is certainly enough strain taken off them, and now they kinda want to bunch up, and if we exercise once in awhile, we feel a lot better. [Long pause]
That's a good note. [Long pause]
Did you read that, Houston?
Roger. Copy that. That's real fine news. [Long pause]
And Walt, sometime - Walt and Donn, sometime after Wally gets awake and the three of you have a real good chance, we'd like to get a good status check on your windows. [Long pause]
Roger. I can give you that now if you'd like.
Okay. Let's do. [Pause]
Okay. Window number 5 is still - I'd say - in very good shape, nothing compared to the pictures I've seen of a bad window in Gemini. Window number 4 is still in good shape - I mean, no concern about taking pictures out of it at all. Window number 3 has been continually deteriorating since about the first day, and you can see moisture collected on the inside of the outer pane and kinda spotty in the middle. You can see horizons out of it, but not a beck of a lot more. Window number 2 is still in good shape. On the left front side of it, you can see a slight amount of discoloration that may eventually work its way in on it. And window number 1 is similar to window number 5 except that it seems to have a lot of these little snow flakes settling on it. Window number 1 is right close to the urine dump and probably is coming from there.
Okay. Copy that. [Long pause]
Okay. We'll have you all the way across the States; we'll just keep standing by. [Pause]
Okay. You might make note that I haven't had any problems with food bags yet. Several comments though; that pill is supposed to be broken up, and you're doing well when you get the pill inside the bag. I don't know anybody who's got fingers strong enough to break it. Also, the gum doesn't have any Velcro on it whenever it shows up, and it's turning out that it's pretty significant that everything have a patch of Velcro on it. [Long pause]
Okay. We copy that.
Also, the wet wipe that's packed with the fecal bags, they do not have Velcor on it, and they need it. [Long pause]
Okay. [Pause]
The temperature inside the cabin has been very comfortable. Wally and Donn put on their inflight coveralls. They got out of the suit. I've been in my CWG ever since, and I guess when we start with the show business, I'll have to get dressed for it. [Long pause]
Okay. Copy that.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
Roger, Houston. Go.
On the G&N control check that you were asking about - over Hawaii - that will be done over the states in high bit rate and real time. It won't require any DSE operation other than normal. [Long pause]
Roger. we will stand by for your verification that you have high bit rate before we start it. [Pause]
Okay. That's real fine.
