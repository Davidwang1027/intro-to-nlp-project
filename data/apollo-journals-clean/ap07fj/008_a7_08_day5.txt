Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Roger, you're very weak, Jack.
Houston, we believe your - you still at Tananarive?
Houston, Apollo 7.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Houston, Apollo 7. [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read?
Read you five-by. We're staning by here.
Roger. Think we better knock this run off here and calculate the amount of fuel usage. [Pause]
We've got over 3 hours in the bank of this test which is a lot better [garble] expected. [Pause]
Wally, we are not reading COMM very well through Tananarive here. [Pause]
We are terminating this test. [Long pause]
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 7. [Pause]
Okay, Apollo 7.
Roger. We've terminated the evaporator test. [Pause]
Wally, we have been monitoring the fuel usage very closely. They find the fuel usage is nominal for this test. We would like to continue test and use the secondary evaporator if to lower the EVAP OUT temperature. [Long pause]
COMM is very bad here over Tananarive; we will have a real good pass with you through Carnarvon. [Pause]
Roger. The primary evaporator is working fine again. [Pause]
Okay. Copy that, Walt.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're 1 minute LOS Tananarive. We'll pick up ARIA 1 in about 2 minutes. Monitor you there througgh Carnarvon. [Long pause]
Roger. We'll continue with the transmit. [Pause]
Roger. Copy. [Long pause]
Hey, Jack, this is Walt. Give me 30 clicks on the water gun in the last 3 hours. [Pause]
How many clicks, Walt?
Thirty.
Roger. Thirty clicks.
And CDR: 25.
Twenty-five to CDR.
Thirty for CMP.
Thirty for CMP.
ARIA 1. Go remote. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7. Stand by. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA. [Long pause]
Apollo 7. Houston through ARIA. Standing by.
ARIA 1, AOS. You may lock. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7. How do you read?
You're reading - I'm reading you five-by, and I have your block data number 11 whenever you're ready to copy.
Roger. Stand by for the copy. Jack, on the Hasselblad magazines: now they have the modified slide in it, and it's possible to take pictures with the slide still in place on the back. I think we'd probably be better off with a safety on those. We just got through taking four pictures with the back in place and wasted ... [Long pause]
Slide.
... slide in place, excuse me, and we wasted four shots there, and probably three or four other ones through the flight at random. [Pause]
Okay. I copy that Walt. [Long pause]
Jack, go ahead with your updates. [Pause]
Roger. Block data 11: 063 dash 4 A plus 305 minus 1599 099 plus 36 plus 59 3402, 064 dash 4 A plus 309 minus 1600 101 plus 13 plus 24 3578, 065 dash 4 A plus 269 minus 1600 102 plus 46 plus 04 2888, 066 dash 3 A plus 309 plus 1363 104 plus 04 plus 38 3403 plus, 067 dash 3 A plus 306 plus 1362 105 plus 41 plus 04 3607, 068 dash 3 Baker plus 261 plus 1344 107 plus 13 plus 10 2888.
Roger. That's complete, your block update, Jack? [Pause]
Affirmative.
A readback as follows. Did you start with 62 or 63? [Pause]
063 dash 4 A.
You're 063 dash 4 A plus 305 minus 1599 099 3659 3402, 064 dash 4 A plus 309 mius 1600 101 13 24 3578, 065 dash 4 A plus 269 minus 1600 102 46 04 2888, 066 dash 3 Alpha plus 309 plus 1363 104 04 38 3403, 067 dash 3 Alpha plus 306 plus 1362 105 41 04 3607, 068 dash 3 Bravo plus 261 plus 1344 107 13 10 2888.
Roger. That's correct. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Did you purge O2? [Pause]
I purged O2 at the regular scheduled time, which was several hours ago, I think. Wasn't it? [Pause]
Roger. We copy.
Check the time on that, will you, Jack?
Roger. That should have been at 94 hours. [Pause]
That's right; we purged at 94 hours.
Okay.
We're going through a meal now and probably have a gripe. The cracker-type food, chicken sandwiches: they are all crumbly, and we have a lot of problem with crumbs all over the cockpit. We have been rejecting a lot of this. [Long pause]
Okay. Wally,we copy that. You are about 1 minute LOS Carnarvon, and we won't get you again till Hawaii at 96 plus 45. [Long pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. [Pause]
We'we completed all data recording throug you. Are you, going to be dumping that tape now. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We are going to revind the tape here. We will dump it over the States. [Pause]
Roger, and can we secure this test? [Pause]
Roger. We will continue for 30 more minutes.
Okay. We are going to secure at 97 hours, Wally.
Roger. [Long pause]
Jack, this is Wally.
Go ahead.
This really a thrilling flight control task. One slow roll in an hour and a half. [Pause]
(Laughter) Roger. Copy that.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Say again.
Walt, I have this daylight scanning telescope star count PAD to give you whenever you are ready to copy. [Long pause]
Okay. It's the the daylight scanning telescope star count or the sextant star count, Jack? [Long pause]
Jack, how much fuel did we blow on that one that is impossible to use? [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7. [Pause]
Wally, we will give you a hack on your fuel use on this - the fuel usage we have copied so far has been between 17 amd 18 pounds, which is in the nominal for this test.
Jack, I'm ready to copy the update chart. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Okay. Walt, stand by one. [Pause]
Jack, on some of these [garble] let's assume we've learned something up here in 5 days that somebody else hasn't learaned yet. [Pause]
Say again, Wally. I missed that.
Let's assume we have learned something up here in the last 5 days that we didn't know before we came up. [Long pause]
Okay. I have this daylight star count PAD to pass up. [Pause]
Okay. We will take it.
Okay. GET of sunrise 98 plus 15, roll 000, pitch 097, yaw 000. GET of sunset minus 12 98 plus 56, roll 000, pitch 327, yaw 000. Your T align will be 98 plus 15, and the only remark ... [Long pause]
Do we have to do this T align for these angles? We have a REFSMVAT now. [Pause]
Roger. The T align is for those angles, and the other chagne on this is that the shaft will be 90 degrees and a trunion of zero degrees. [Long pause]
Okay. Zero shaft 90. Donn has got something to report. [Pause]
Jack, we did this test a couple of days ago with a 120-degrees angle up, and I just didn't see much point in it. Your ability to see stars is not so much the function of light transmission of the telescope as it is a matter of stray light you got coming in from loose particles flying around outside that look like stars and also in stray light that comes up from the Earth and whatnot, distorting the telescope picture. Jack, the point is that I don't think you are going to learn a lot from this. We know already that the stars aren't all the same [garble] adapter. [Long pause]
Okay. Donn, we've got real poor COMM. I can't quite copy. Let's wait until we get over the coast, and we will have a little better COMM. [Pause]
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Go ahead.
Roger. Appears to us that the evaporator might be drying out again. [Pause]
Darn right. [Pause]
Jack, I've been trying to tell you that with realignment we lose fuel, get into a new attitude, fly at two different attitudes to prove what we have already discovered in this flight: that you can't see stars in the telescope except jast after sunrise [garble] or just after [garble] sunset which we have been trying to tell the Project 0ffice for about 5 years. [Long pause]
Roger. Copy that. Wally, this test here has the telescope sunlight of sight at 70 degrees, which is the worst case, and we would kind of like to get this one in. [Long pause]
That's what I've been trying to tell you. With the best case, we didn't do any good. If you want us to do the test, all right; we will do it, but we are kind of tired of arguing whith peole who tell us to do this. I'm not talking about you, but the various things you don't know about telscopes. [Long pause]
It's a quarter after 12:00, Cape time. [Pause]
Houston, is the radiator degradation test over yet? [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. You can discontinue the raditor degradation test. [Pause]
Roger.
You appear wide open from here today. [Pause]
Go ahead. Apollo 7.
Roger. You look like you are pretty wide open on weather today. [Pause]
That's affirmative.
We remember last time. Over. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Go ahead, Jack.
Donn, while you are taking photographs during either this stateside pass - or the next one if you can fit it in - we like to get a picture of Tucson and a picture of a tropical storm which is presently just south of Cuba. [Long pause]
Understand. Tucscon and a storm south of Cuba. [Pause]
Roger. Tropical storm Gladys just south of Cuba. [Pause]
Which end, Jack? South of Haiti or south of the [garble]? [Long pause]
If you could give us latitude and longitude, that would help us. [Pause]
Stand by, wally. [Long pause]
Okay. Wally, the present position of this storm is south of the eastern tip of Cuba and east - western tip of Cuba and east off Yucatan Peninsula. [Long pause]
[Garble] up through the Cuban Islands? Okay. We got a pretty good fix on it. It will be on the next two passes, and we should get a cut of it. [Long pause]
Next pass, it looks like you would be in a little better position; it looks like you might even pass right over it. [Long pause]
Jack, this is Donn. Would you log me ten clicks on the water gun? [Pause]
Roger. Copy that.
Give Walt 15 clicks.
Fifteen for Walt.
And Schirra will take 20.
Okay. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, we show you are approaching Guaymas LOS. [Pause]
That's what you call skirting the issue, just going by the edge.
Roger. [Long pause]
Jack, on that Tucson-Phoenix, did you want the Pan-X or the 121? [Pause]
Stand by.
We'll get you that by the next pass.
Roger. Plenty of time. [Pause]
Jack. On that tropical storm coming up there: do you expect that to come up into the Gulf of Mexico? [Pause]
Right now, the forecast that is past, it is up into the west coast of Florida. [Pause]
I see. [Pause]
Jack, on that pass, would you log the following pictures, magazine S? Starting down around about 55. I got two good pictures of Houston, two of Nee Orleans, Mobile Bay, Pensacola. Wally got the Mississippi Delta, the Fort Walter area, and that was about it. The Cape was cloudy, patchy, broken. [Long pause]
Okay. Copy of that. [Pause]
Jack, I would recommend to the next crew that try to eliminate as much bite-size food; that's bothering all of us already. [Pause]
Okay. We copy.
The hot one [garble]. [Long pause]
However, the breakfast dring is going over very well, but we need a better type of food. [Pause]
Okay. Copy. I think he - wait till I get my sheet out now. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Go ahead.
Apollo 7, Houston. Regarding this daylight scanning telescope start count: we're not going to be able to do it with the present REFSMMAT because of the gimbal lock problem. We understood yesterday that we saw more stars than we anticipated at the 220-degree line of sight, and we would like very much to get this test in at the 70-degree line of sight. Over.
Apollo 7, Arollo 7, Houston. Did you copy?
Yes, we read you.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Roger.
Roger. You are five-by. Could you copy our conversation on the scanning telescope star count that we were giving you over Bermuda? [Pause]
I got you. Roger, Jack.
okay.
I've got some information for you. In minimum impulse and roll, if the stick is released, it will fire a jet in the opposite direction exactly as in the simulator. [Long pause]
Could you go over that again, please?
Okay. In pulse mode, minimum impulse ...
Roger.
... if one impulse is entered - say roll right - the stick is released and brought to neutral; it will cross neutral and roll left one pulse. [Pause]
Roger. Copy that.
It's the same as the sticks in the simulator; it's not unique. [Pause]
Okay. The other thing we wanted to ask you to do: you could do the H2 stratification test whenever you can fit it in there. [Long pause]
Roger. Thank you. That's inside the next half hour. [Pause]
Okay. We'd like you to put your tape recorder forward switch to FORWARD. [Pause]
Roger. Are you through dumping?
Affirmative.
It is in FORWARD.
Okay. The other thing we'd like to get is the general crew status with a status on each man. Could you give us kind of a complete rundown on each man, how they're feeling today? [Long pause]
This is CDR. I still have a rather thick mucous nose cold, but none of us are coughing. We're very well rested although last night was rather a short night; and we'll take advantage of the longer hours tonight to catch up again. We'we all had plenty to eat and to drink, if not too much. The sight of the food is just too rich for us. I'm still on aspirin, and I'm off Actifed at this time, and all of us are getting out of Actifed. We don't have enough left to keep taking it for the length of the mission. We'll use it prior to reentry. [Long pause]
This is the CMP. My only complaint is a head cold, just like Wally. I find that my ears plug up now and then. I would take the Actifed except for running out, and I want to save it for reentry in case we need it then. Other than that, I'm in good shape. I've had plenty to eat and drink, had plenty of sleep. No problem. [Long pause]
Are you still reading, Jack?
Roger.
Okay. I'm in good shape. I've been sleeping a little better every night, and my ears are just barely clear some mornings and sometimes not. I don't feel bad; I don't feel like I have a cold. I just feel like I'm pretty well stuffed up and on the verge of getting one. [Long pause]
Okay. Copied that. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, have any of you had indications of a temperature rise? [Pause]
Negative.
Okay. Fine. Sometime - no hurry on it - you might give us a count an your medication remaining. We kind of lost track here. [Long pause]
Okay. We've been logging it and calling it down, Jim, if you haven't gotten a report on every bit of it. One interesting observation, with a head cold, the fluids do not flow down the throat and cause any lung problems. It stays up in the sinuses. This is due to zero gravity, I'm sure. [Long pause]
Okay. Copy that. [Pause]
Jack, this is Donn. I just did a daylight P52. How it happened, we rolled over so that we're staring up to the stars. I did P52 and picked a pair that worked, so I lucked out. It turns out that you can, in general, see stars in the sextant provided it's not too close to the sun and provided all the optics will pull them in for you, but of course, it is impossible to see anything through the telescope under these conditions. [Long pause]
Understand ...
... by the stars I marked on explicitly. I assume they are right because the star difference angles was proper. [Pause]
Okay. Real fine.
I wouldn't want to hang my hat on that if I were going to the Moon, however. [Pause]
Roger. Understand.
I'd like to make the point; he confirmed the two stars by the star angle difference, like four balls 1. [Pause]
Okay.
And by the pick a pair. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We show that one panel is still isolated, and we're about to lose you over Ascension. We'll pick you up at Tananarive here at 497 plus 38. [Long pause]
Roger. That's a good call down there. Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. [Pause]
I read you, Jack. [Pause]
Roger. We're standing by.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Tananarive. We'll try ARIA 1 at 97:51; Carnarvon at 97:53. [Long pause]
Roger.
ARIA 1, go REMOTE.
ARIA 1, go REMOTE. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 1. [Long pause]
Apollo 7 - Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 1. Over. [Long pause]
AOS, ARIA 1 AOS. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 1. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
Roger. Jack, I tried to put the primary evaporator back on the line, and it didn't make it. [Pause]
Okay. I was trying to reach you through ARIA 1 to do that S-band DTO for ARIA. [Long pause]
We didn't hear you.
Roger. I didn't hear you, either. On your question about the film over the stateside pass for the pictures of Tucson: the film to use is S0121. [Long pause]
Roger. Thank you. [Pause]
Jack out of curiosity, how many different kinds of S-band passes are there? I'll give you time to figure that one out. [Long pause]
7, it appears to be about 20 or 30 different types of modes and conditions for S-band communication tries here. [Long pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. On the primary evaporator: did you reservice it before your attemps to put it back onthe line? [Pause]
Sure did. We serviced it over Canaries. [Pause]
Okay. Copy.
Temperatures are even running pretty hot. Can you confirm that both of my radiator panels are flowing now with the individual temperatures, please? [Long pause]
7, both of your RAD panels look good. [Pause]
Roger. Thank you. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
I will give you a medication count. There are three categories: Actifed, aspirin, and one more pill [garble]. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, I didn't - I copy that you are going to give us the quantity remaining of the three medications. [Pause]
Negative; the quantity used per crewman,
Okay. Go ahead with the quantity used.
Roger. CDR: Actifed six, aspirin 17, Lomatil two; CMP: Actifed two, aspirin two. [Long pause]
Copy.
LMP: one Actifed. [Pause]
Roger. Copy that. Thank you very much.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS Carnarvon; a shor pass at Guam at 98:07; Hawaii at 98:18. [Pause]
Okay. [Garble].
Apollo 7, Houston through Guam. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
7, we haven't had a window status check in a while. How are they doing? [Pause]
Roger. They're - why don't we give you a check the next daylight, Jack? [Pause]
Okay. Real fine. And the other thing I was kind of curious about, Wally, can you hear the thruster - the RCS thrusters - fire? [Pause]
Affirmative.
Okay. Real fine.
Only when they light off; we can't hear them when they're burning. [Pause]
Okay.
Right now, the main thing is you can hear a pulse. It sounds like your hearing - as Donn describes it - a water barrel, a thump, a clunkn, no hissing sound to them at all. [Pause]
Roger. Copy.
However, the thing seems to have almost a surge of power. It fluctuates back and forth on a sort of a cyclic beat, rather than steady, smooth application of power. [Long pause]
Okay. Copy. We're about 40 seconds from LOS Guam; Hawaii at 98:18. [Pause]
Roger. You might pass that description down to John Healy. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Rorer. That set of angles was very good this time. We found the Moon right in the middle of the telescope. [Pause]
Roger. Copy. We would like to send you up a NAV load, and I'm ready with a NAV check when you're ready to copy. Would you go to ACCEPT? [Long pause]
Okay an the NAV check.
Okay. Comming up. The NAV check as follows: 102 plus 30 plus 0000 minus 1154 plus 06596 1522. [Long pause]
Roger. Read back as follows: 102 30 four balls minus 1154 minus 06596 1522. Over. [Pause]
That's correct. [Pause]
Jack, did you get the impact of the Moon being in the telescope? [Pause]
Roger. We're discussing that right now.
Yes, you don't count stars when you look at the Moon. [Pause]
Roger. We're scrething our heads.
And it's inertial like we are. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. The load is in; we're finished; the computer is yours. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Looks good enough to us.
Huntsville two-wheel lock; no ranging.
Houston, Apollo 7. We should be able to hack the star count on the next pass. The Moon will not be in the next attitude. [Pause]
Roger. We copy.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're all ready for the keying test. [Pause]
Wait one on that keying test.
Roger. [Pause]
Okay. I'll go ahead and give you a keying test. We're coming up on a photo shortly. [Pause]
Roger, 7. Could you stand by one? We lost [garble]. [Pause]
Okay. I'll stand by. [Long pause]
Ready to go on the keying?
Not yet. We're still standing by. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We're ready for the keying test. [Pause]
Roger. It follows: (sounds of the Morse code) da (letter t) di-di-di-di (letter h) di-di (letter i) di-di-di (letter s) di-di (letter i) di-di-di (letter s) di-da (letter a) da (letter t) di (letter e) di-di-di (letter s) da (letter t) di-da-da (letter w) di-di (letter i) da-di (wrong letter, should be letter "t") di (letter e) da-da (letter m) di (letter e) di-da-di (letter r) da-da-di (letter g) di (letter e) da-di (letter n) da-di-di-da-di (wrong code, shold be a letter "c") da-di-da-da (letter y) da-di-da (letter k) di (letter e) da-di-da-da (letter y)
Keying test over.
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We are through with the keying test. You can reconfigure your spacecraft per the Flight Plan, and you only made two mistakes. [Pause]
Yes, I put a couple of dits instead of dashs, didn't I?
Roger.
Back to configuration.
Okay. Copy.
Last shot crossing States was 67, and Corpus Christi magasine 0. [Pause]
Okay. Copy that.
We are crossing the Gulf now, looking for the storm. [Long pause]
You can give us a MARK when you think we are adjacent to it. [Pause]
Okay. Will do, Wally. You got a little ways to go yet.
Jack, that looks like one big white overcast about 12 o'clock. [Pause]
That should be it. The tropical storm will be south of your flight path here; your flight path should take you right over Cuba, and the tropical storm will be south of the western tip of Cuba. [Long pause]
Okay.
We'll take a strip going into it; I think that's the best bet.
Okay. [Long pause]
We've got one big stormy area out here, Jack. I don't pick up a characteristic tropical storm. [Pause]
Okay. Right nov, the wind speeds are about 45 knots. Tomorrow sometime, the winds are forecast to pick up to 70. [Long pause]
If it comes up in the Gulf, you can all go down and bail my boat out. [Pause]
Roger. There are a few other people with the same problem.
Understand. They've got a better chance of getting to their boat than I have right now. [Pause]
I think you're right.
[Garble]. [Pause]
I think that is part of the duties of the support crew; we'll take care of it, Wally.
I think [garble] Jack. [Long pause]
Jack, frame 68 was the cloud cover that - not really a storm I could discern. [Pause]
Roger, copy. [Long pause]
Could you get our rates down there, Jack? [Pause]
Roger. Stand by.
Roger. The pitch rate now is not something I put in. It just comes from coupling with that little atmosphere of convectional air. [Long pause]
Wally, right now, it looks like we've got a pitch rate of pins .3. [Pause]
Roger. I don't think we have anithing to worry about on one or two pulses, and the spacecraft actually is torquing E itself in pitch, that's all. It's costing us earlier on the O radiator degradation test. We think it's just the way it goes through an attitude at a certain atmospheric affect, what little there is. [Long pause]
Okay. [Long pause]
That's a pretty good track of our attitude there, and I had - oh, less than one pulse in that direction in pitch, and you can see what happened. [Pause]
Okay. We'll get a little more accurate hack at it when we take a look at this strip chart. [Pause]
Right that's what I'd like to have you take note of.
Okay. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We'd like to have you turn your O2 fans tank 2 for 3 minutes. [Pause]
Roger. On. [Pause]
I finished the hydrogen stratification test, and it was about like the first one. There was a slightly noticeable pressure decrease when I turned the fans on, on the order of maybe 2 psi, something like that, and it's stabilized out right there. [Long pause]
Okay. Real fine, Walt.
Jack, note the pitch rate right now. It is decreasing, yet I have not turned any pitch pulses in, and there are no thrusters firing. It's a good pass to make note of what we're talking about. [Long pause]
Okay. We got it. We'll look at it real close.
Okay. There were no pitch pulses at that point. [Long pause]
We've been noting this all during the flight and thought on this this pass to get a record on it. Note the pitch rate is decreasing all the time. [Long pause]
Okay. We'll realy take a good look at it.
Okay. This is something we have a beck of a time trying to explain to ourselves. It was pitching in the right direction, so I wasn't going to take it out. It's almost going to pitch zero. [Long pause]
There was no IVA during tbat either, by the way.
Okay. Copy that. It sounds like you got a built-in ORB rate torquer there. [Pause]
Yes. See there. It's almost zero pitch. I haven't done a thing to it. In fact. I've got to do some more pitching to get up to the 326. [Pause]
Roger. That's what we're looking -.
[Garble]. That's two more. [Long pause]
We knew what was heating us up during the radiator degradation test. We were going through these kind of attitudes and had to work to get through them. [Pause]
Copy. We still were nominal on fuel during that whole test. [Pause]
Roger. Understand. But what we're telling you is about like this. I put three pulses, and it's back to zero again. [Pause]
Roger...
[Garble].
Hey, Jack, being nominal on that test implies that the three points were present. Donn and I - on numerous tries, the simulator ran below the nominal fuel usage on that thing where there were no torques. [Long pause]
That's real fine information, Walt. [Pause]
I put three more pulses in. [Long pause]
Houston, do you still read?
Roger. We are still reading you, Wally.
That's zero again with no pulses. [Pause]
You'll have some fun reading this one. Over. [Pause]
Say again.
You'll have some fun redusing the data on this one. [Pause]
We have people busy on it, and we are watching it right here. [Pause]
That's it. We think it is kind of an interesting phenomenon. I'm back to zero again. [Garble]. The best exercise in roceted direction [garble]. [Long pause]
Two more pulses. [Long pause]
And it's back to zero again. [Garble]. [Long pause]
Zero clocked her, coordinated command, and gave it about 0.2.
You might know it's not precise exept in COMMAND, but it is much more precise than it is in a simulator. [Pause]
Roger.
I could call 0.2 and give it to you. [Long pause]
Hey, Jack, how are we doing in our other consumables?
Well, I notice from the Flight Plan that 60 percent hydrogen test is nominally at 102 to 103 hours. Are we running pretty much nominal there or a little behind or what? [Long pause]
We are about to lose you here over Antigua. We will pick you up at Ascension at 56.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Pause]
Roger. Loud and clear.
Okay. You're loud and clear. Wally, on this pitch rate: it would help us out a little bit - we could get a little bit more data - if you would put your GDC on FDAI number 1. [Long pause]
What we had was right at 90 degrees. We're only locked into a deadband now, Jack. We're right about - pitched up at 090, straight up. [Long pause]
Okay. Copy. We get better data on that pitch rate for - on telemetry if we can put the GDC on FDAI number 1. [Long pause]
I see. Okay. Next time we see it, we'll do that. [Pause]
Okay, and - [Pause]
It appears that, apparently, we had the spacecraft pointed straight up, the command on the X-axis this morning, away from the Earth on the radial. [Pause]
You say that's when it occurred, when the X-axis was pointed away from the Earth? [Pause]
That's the way it was this time, and that's the wayit seems to be in the past. [Pause]
Okay. Real fine. That gives us a good clue.
It's not active now, CapCom?
No. It's rotated around now. [Pause]
Okay. Has it quit now, wally? [Pause]
That's affirm. We're nov about 140 degrees local Tertical. [Pause]
Okay. Real fine. And relative to Walt's question on the hydrogen usage, we figure you're about 1 pound above nominal. [Long pause]
Roger. And we look like we are even better off with oxygen. [Pause]
That's affirmative.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Ascension; Tananarive at 99 plus 13. [Pause]
Jack, did the doctor ever say anything about using this antibiotic as a preventative medicine up here? [Pause]
Stand by. [Long pause]
Okay. Walt, on that question: there is really not any need to use any of the antibiotic; they don't feel that would help or cure a cold. [Long pause]
Well, so far, I've been able to resist pretty much if getting one, but Donn's coming down I think a little bit better here, if there's some way I could hold it off, I would just as soon take the pill. Or do they just want me to go ahead and catch it, then treat it? [Pause]
Okay. We'll pick you up over Tananarive.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tanansrive. [Pause]
Roger. Jack ... [Pause]
You're five-by ...
We're powered down in the drifting flight configuration. [Pause]
Roger. Copy that. We'll be standing by.
We're going to activate the evaporator again. It gets awful stuffy in here if we don't have it running.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger. Five-by. We've been going over some of the results of the keying test we did over the States. It leads us to two questions we would like to ask. 0ne, was the PMP in AUXILIARY? [Long pause]
Negative.
And the next question, was the keying24 done with the panel switch ow the mike button? [Pause]
I keyed with the mike button on my control head. [Pause]
Okay. Thank you.
Jack, we have one for you.
Go ahead.
Okay. We powered down, and just checking over my CAL's, it would appear that the SPS logic bus 3 switch might help. Does it? [Long pause]
Would you say again? We didn't copy, Wally. [Pause]
Okay. I said I've got the SPS powered down.
Roger.
Does the SPS logic bus 3 save us any power? [Pause]
Okay. stand by.
... when added to the rest? [Pause]
Okay. Stand by. We'll get you the answer. [Long pause]
Roger. Log 15 clicks of water for the CMP. [Pause]
Okay. Will do.
And, Jack, when you get a chance, can we get an update on the RCS profile I have onboard? [Pause]
Okay. In work.
Thank you. [Long pause]
Walt, your RCS reading on your plot will be 714. [Pause]
Roger. 714. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, could you get us some results of your scaning telescope test ...
... when we operate the DMP on AUXILIARY, we seem to be [garble] a pretty good check on that, haven't we? [Long pause]
I'm sorry, Walt, I was transmitting somthing to you at the same time. Can you say again? [Pause]
Roger. We have, coming up over Carnarvon, PMP powered AUXILIARY with an S-Band check. Have we already satisfied some of those by an earlier operation in AUXILIARY for some time? [Long pause]
I guess I'm asking do you want to continue that test; should I plan on PMP AUXILIARY; and what were you saying when I transmitted? [Pause]
Okay. Walt, we do want to put the PMP to AUXILIARY. That puts us in our PCM down on the FM. [Long pause]
Put your ...
[Garble] a long time early in the flight like that? [Long pause]
Walt, w'll hit you at Guam at 99 plus 39 and Hawaii at 99 plus 53. [Pause]
Okay. And give me a call if you want PMP powered AUXILIARy. [Pause]
Roger. We want the PMP on AUXILIARY. That's just the configuration for the test.
Apollo 7, Houston through Guam. [Long pause]
Roger. I read you.
Roger. Five-By. We would like you to put your PMP power to AUX. [Pause]
Roger. AUX [Garble]. [Long pause]
I didn't copy that last one. Say again. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Looks like we're getting about two-by on the COMM here at Guam. After the COMM test at Hawaii, we would like to to have you comment briefly on the results of the scanning telescopes star count.
Guam M and O, Houston CapCom.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. How do you read AUXILIARY PMP? [Pause]
I read you five-by, Walt; and relative to Wally's question on a SCS logics bus, it will save us about 2 amps, and you can turn that switch off if you'd like. [Long pause]
Okay. We'llturn it off; It'll cool it down in here a little bit. It's been getting warm and stuffy. [Pause]
Roger. Copy that. [Long pause]
You wouldn't believe the way we're eating today. [Pause]
I bet I would. [Long pause]
When things get boring, we play IVA. [Pause]
Roger. Copy that. You're 1 minute LOS Guam; Hawaii at 99 plus 53. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Roger. Laud and clear. We just got [garble]. [Pause]
Okay. You're loud and. clear here. Go ahead. [Long pause]
[Garble]. [Pause]
Number 2 window is in real good shape, but the perimeter - it's fogging around the perimeter particularly in the upper portion. About - oh, it's very thick [garble] about half an inch in from perimeter and thins out to a perfectly good, clear window. The hatch window has never been usable since shortly after insertion into orbit. Large condesation inside now in the inner surface of the inner pane; and the center of the window, a circle about 5 inches in diameter, looks like snowflake crystals all across it; it's actually opaque. [Long pause]
Window number 4 [garble] fogging [garble] right around the edge, toward the inner surface of the inner pane - outer pane towards the minus Z axes, primaily, including from the edge, and it's [garble] half inch in worst spots, but it's still a perfectly ... [Long pause]
Okay. Apollo 7, Houston. We lost you on the handover there. We will pice you up with the last half of window 4 when we get good contact With the Huntswille. [Long pause]
You got one through three?
Roger. We copy window 3. we got cut of just as you started to give us window 4. [Pause]
Roger. We just broke the century hour. [Long pause]
Do you read, Houston?
Okay. Read you five-by. We are ready to copy window 4. [Pause]
Okay. Did you hear Wally's remrk we just broke 100 hours. [Pause]
Roger. We got that.
Window number 4 has started to occlude. It's on the edge abd starting its ray inward. At the worst spot now three-eights to one-half ... [Long pause]
Okay. Copy that.
Okay [garble] photography. The window number 5 starting to get some kind of a film on the inner surface of the outer pane, but you have to look pretty close to see lt. It is still perfectly visible for photography. [Long pause]
Okay. Windows 2 and 4 are sufficient for star work, but the other ones are not. [Pause]
Okay. Copy that. [Pause]
Jack, yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the entry of D. Eisele and W. Cunningham into this program. [Long pause]
We copy that anniversary. [Pause]
Is it, safe for champagne? [Pause]
Say again.
[Garble]. [Pause]
We didn't copy, Wally. Could you give us window number 1 again? [Pause]
I think the window is getting worse, clouding the vision due to the overboard dump. The particles depending on the spacecraft attitude to bounce off it or collect on it. [Long pause]
Do you read?
Okay. Got it.
My question was is Deke Slayton still in town? [Pause]
Okay. Our COMM with Huntsville is deteriorated. We're not reading you too well. We'11 pick you up over the States. [Pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Loud and clear.
You're loud and clear, too. Would you get your PMP switch to NORMAL? [Long pause]
And then we would like to have you configure for the relay mode.
Roger. [Long pause]
Like to get a readout on the GBC versus CMC. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Are you configured for the relay test here at Guaymas? [Pause]
Apollo 7, do you read? [Pause]
Roger, Apollo 7, do you read? Houston. [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7. Over. [Pause]
Go ahead. [Long pause]
We haven't configured yet, Houston. [Pause]
Roger. Copy. I understand you have not configured for the relay test.
Roger. I haven't have the cue yet. [Pause]
Okay. Would you put your PMP power switch to NORMAL and configure for the relay test. [Pause]
Roger. Configured.
Power PMP NORMAL and is configured for relay test. I ran out of it in order to get the contact with you again. I'm at Duplex A now and configured to relay. [Pause]
Roger. I understand, Apollo 7. You're configured for relay test. We're not performing the relay test. [Long pause]
Roger. Apollo 7, Houston. Counting one, two, three, four, five - five, four, three, two, one. Performing the relay test. [Long pause]
Houston performing the relay test - one, two, three, four, five - five, four, three, two, one.
This is Houston performing the relay test. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, two, one.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. We copied your RELAY mode check. How did it work? [Pause]
Well, there is some question on it. Can you confirm that you were in the relay mode per your COMM slide rule? [Pause]
That's affirmative.
Okay. Fine. Thank you. [Pause]
Did it work, or did it not? [Pause]
Ground didn't copy the rely so we had some question there.
Roger. We read you.
Magazine S frame 69: west coast of southern Mexico. [Pause]
Okay. Copy that.

How do you read?
Apollo 7, Houston.
How do you read, Ron?
Tananarive M&0, Houston CapCom. Are we getting out to you? [Pause]
Roger, CapCom, Apollo 7. Reading you 5 by.
Apollo 7. Houston. Transmitting in the blind. We're trying to find a piece of the data for the radiator degradation test around 96 hours. This was when we were considering terminating the test, and Walt, can you confirm tape recorder ON at that time? [Long pause]
Apollo 7. Stand by. [Pause]
Tananarive M and O. They rogered, Houston CapCom [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7. We turned that ON, ...
... right right on the minute. [Pause]
Roger. Understand yon did have it on. Thank you. [Pause]
That's affirmative. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS; Mercury at 11.
Roger, thank you. Good evening, Ron.
Houston, do you still read?
Apollo 7, Houston, Mercury. standing by. [Pause]
Roger.
Say, Ron. I wanted to confirm that we rechecked our switches for the RELAY mode, and everything was configured appropriately. We have ... [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Do you read, Ron?
I missed part of your comments there, but the RELAY mode worKed okay. [Pause]
Oh, it did work okay? Jack indicated that it wasn't conclusive. [Pause]
No, that was our mistake; it worked okay. [Pause]
Okay. And I understand we have the same check coming up in a couple of hours? [Pause]
Say again. What check?
We have the same thing coming up for another check over Hawaii in a couple of hours, and wanted to confirm that we did turn on the tape recorder for all those data points. And one of them - we were 3 or 4 minutes late on the radiator test, but the one in question that you asked about I believe we turned on right on the dot. [Long pause]
Okay. Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Long pause]

Apollo 7, Houston. One line Flight Plan update. [Long pause]
Go ahead.
Roger. At 102 plus 20, delete CRYO test at this time. [Long pause]
Roger. We did it earlier at 50 percent. [Pause]
Roger. We're estimating 60 - you'll hate about 60 percent O2 at aboutt 134 hours, something like that. We,ll update later on. [Long pause]
Roger. The O2 be done later, you mean?
That's affirmative.
Hey, Ron, we can just have a standing Flight Plan on that. It's supposed to be done at 60 percent, so we'll just do it when it gets to 60 plus or minus 5. [Pause]
Sounds good. [Pause]
Can we have a chart update too, Ron? [Pause]
Say again.
A chart update.
Wilco. stand by. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. I have your map update. [Pause]

Huntsville. Two-way signal too weak for valid range. [Long pause]
Huntsville. Two-way lock. Valid range.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Houston. Go.
Roger. Log the CMP 15 clicks on the water gan; the LMP, 30 clicks. [Long pause]
Awful garbled, Walt. Say again. [Pause]
Roger. Give the CMP 15 clicks on the water gun and the LMP 30 clicks. [Pause]
I can't read you here. We'll pick that - pick you up in Guaymas in about 2 minutes. [Long pause]
Apollo 7. Houston. Say again your last transmission now. [Pause]
Roger. Ron, I was just logging some water; 15 clicks for LMP and 30 clicks for the - excuse me 15 clicks for CMP and 30 clicks for the LMP. [Long pause]
Roger. Thank you. [Long pause]
Thirty seconds LOS; Tananartve at 20.
This is CDR. Some of our equipment is starting to show signs of age. The Exer-Genie, although used somewhat extensively, is starting to fray and not run smoothly. The bootees on my Teflon suit are starting to unravel and come apart. The microphone on my right-hand headset is cracked, and, except for being taped together, would not function.
The ear tube on Walt Cunningham's right-hand headset is coming apart. The COMM carrier connectors to the suits are all getting frayed at the fitting where they make up to the sUit. I think it is because we take these off and on with a great amount of frequency.
We've had a problem with the wristwatch straps. They are much too long for a normal shirtsleeve attire and are just about right for the pressure suit. They should be made as small as possible for the pressure suit, and then they might have a chance of fitting the wrist with two turns around it.
Now, one technique was used on Eisele's watch, to pass the watch through a Velcro band. And some technique similar to this might work for both suited and unsuited work.
We've had a continuous problem with the 70mm back in that the slider plate for removal of the back will not prevent actuation of the shutter. This is not designed that way in the stock Hasselblad; it has been modified nicely to cause this effect in our crew camera.
The last-minute changes in film seem to be par for the course in this business. And it's a big mistake to have four different ASA films onboard, particularly when we pass the camera back and forth rapidly in a drifting mode when a good target's available. We shot our S0117 the first day or so at ASA 64. And this was so we would not waste the 368 as well, which is also ASA 64. Now we have S0121, nominally for shooting at ASA 60, and soon we will be shooting Panatomic-X at ASA 45. This is not the way to run a railroad. There are many - there are many films available with a common ASA available. For high-speed work, naturally we prefer the ASA 1000.
At this point in the flight, over 100 hours, it's almost impossible to believe we started this flight out with the pressure suit on. The environment just doesn't even seem to be acceptable to the big lumpy. And I suspect that we are going to put them on with great misgivings after the time required. If our head conditions are not cleared up in time, I believe we probably will reject using those suits. This is not a decision at this point, but merely an opinion.
Apollo 7. Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.

Houston, Apollo 7.
Houston. Go.
Roger. You can give Walt credit for 12 clicks of water and give me 30. [Pause]
wilco.
And the water's tasting very good, so we'll chlorinate one more time and see how bat it gets, and that may be the last dose. [Pause]
I understand what you're saying.
Okay. Thank you. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
[Garble] and see where we stand. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. You're unreadable. [Pause]
We predict that we should chlorinate every other day so we'll see how that works out. [Pause]
Is Hawaii in RELAY modes? [Pause]
Walt, that's affirmative. Configure for RELAY mode prior to 103 plus 02. [Pause]
Wilco. Okay. We'll be on Duplex A as we go the hill now. [Pause]
Affirmative. And Walt, we'd like you to cycle O2 tank 2 fans ON for 5 minutes, then OFF. [Long pause]
Then what? [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite ommi.
Ron, we just made a big discovery. I just turned the O2 fan number 2 down ON, and it started our DET in the lover equipment bay. [Long pause]
Beautiful. [Pause]
Did you read that?
Affirmsaive. DET in the LEB atarted when you turned the fans on. [Pause]
That's correct. [Pause]
Always excitement up here. That lends credence to the theory that it does touch the spacecraft. [Long pause]
Say your last comment, Wally.
That lends credence to the theory that the fans do pulse the spacecraft. [Pause]
Roger. We - we'll read it back on the tape. I still didn't get you. [Long pause]

Okay. I've - w've been leaving number 1 in AUTO; is that your druthers? [Pause]
We started out the other way and Donn had it the other way, so it's ... [Long pause]
It's in AUTO, and the other one cycle on your callouts, right?
Tha's affirmative. So you have tank 1 in AUTO and tank 2 fans cycling now. [Pause]
ON for 5 minutes. [Long pause]
Purge on time. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Long pause]
7, Houston. We have 1 minute to LOS. Our O2 is about 63 pounds above the nominal Flight Plan at this time, and the H2 is abOUt a half a pound above the nominal Flight Plan. So we're in good shape. [Long pause]
Very good.
Apollo 7, Houston, Ascension. Standig by. [Pause]
Roger. Thank you, Evans. Any more local news around there to report? [Pause]
Roger. I can give you - looks like the end of the mission now predicted. The word I have, 25 percent O2 left, and about 6.8 percent H2 left. [Long pause]
Roger. I understand; that sounds good. About what I predicted on the hydrogen, I think, isn't it? [Pause]
I think so. On the fuell cells, perfformance is right down the mide. Purging is turning out nominal. Looks like we'll plan to purge O2 immediately prior to the SPS burn, and this should improve the load-sharing characteristics between the fuell cell and the battery. [Long pause]
Roger. I understand, and is the SPS burn nominally what it is in the Flight Plan? [Pause]
The SPS burns are still per Flight Plans, yes. [Pause]
Roger. Thank you. Did they tell you we're purging water before each SPS burn, too? [Pause]
Say again, Wally.
I don't know whether you got the report or not, but there is vast water collecting all over the plumbing on the ECS, and it forms rather large blobs that we're going tO have to take off before we get a burn going again [garble] that's all. [Long pause]
Roger. I understand you want to collect a11 the water at one place. [Pause]
Yes, not on the aft bulkhead.
Right.
[Garble] burn checklist. Did you get to see the TV picture where the [garble] kind of sharp today. [Long pause]
Yes, we did. It came through real good.
Very good. How has that onboard TV been showing up? Could you detect our motion, ar are we moving too fast, ar what? [Long pause]
No, it's real good. If you have a real fast movement, you get a little bit of a blur, but just in the floating movements. It turns out real fine, real fine. It's amazing; it's much better than anythig I've ever seen in ground testing. [Long pause]
Good deal. Is this taped during the [garble] so we can see it? [Pause]
Yes, it's taped. [Pause]
Yes, okay.
Donn said he [garble] but 6 years ago he got to me the way. [Pause]
Missed that, Wally.
Six years ago, he asked me that question. [Pause]
Only I had a tape on board, and I was about 3 minutes out on an Atlas. [Pause]
Okay. [Long pause]
You still there, Ron?
Affirm.
What's the status of our tape recorder; have dumped it recently? [Pause]
Roger. The last two passes we had ower the Mercury. It wasn't quite as good. We're checking it out at Redstone now. It was good up untill that time. [Pause]
Roger. How about a chart update if you have time?
Roger. [Long pause]
Walt, can you check - your tape recorder forward switch in FORWARD? [Pause]
It is.
Roger. And here's your Flight Plan update.
Go ahead.
REV 68, GET is note 107 plus 01 plus 55, longitude 15.9 east, right ascension 04 plus 47.
Frame 77 on Sierra back is of sunspots off the river in the valley just south of the Himalayas.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. [Pause]
Roger, Houston. Loud and clear.
Roger. I have a battery status if you're ready to copy. [Long pause]
Apollo 7. Opposite omni. [Pause]
Go ahead with the batteries. [Pause]
Roger. You presently have three; in A 32.7, in B 30.2, in C 39.5 ampere hours. [Long pause]
Roger.
For pre-deorbit, you will have in A 24.8, in B 22.2, in C 39.5, for total of 86.5 ampere hours. [Long pause]
Roger.
Predicted post finding time will be 35 hours. [Pause]
Roger. Understand, Ron. The only concern I have about battery charge is supporting the battery failure on a hybrid deorbit. [Pause]
Rodger. We concur. You might be interested: it's believed that we've had a slight change in the battery charger characteristics as a function off altitude, such that the charging voltage at the battery terminals is about two- to three-tenths volts lover than normal, and this would account for the decreased charging current. We're conting ground testing to better define this anomaly. [Long pause]
This was done subsequent to our lift-off? [Pause]
Say again, Wally. [Pause]
You say this was done after we took off, Ron?
That's affirmative.
It's good work that they found it out.
Yes, right. No additional battery charging is anticipated at this time. We recommend minimazing battery ON time for all burns. [Long pause]
That's kind of hard to do, but we'll do it. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
[Garble] we're going to break up and get Donn on watch shortly. He'll be with you on next call. [Pause]
Roger. Understand. Have a good night's sleep. [Pause]
Good night. Ron, did you have PSI system power up? We had it written here on the Flight Plan here at about 107:20. [Long pause]
Roger. It's in there. We're checing on it right now. [Pause]
We'll hold off an it then, I guess. [Pause]
If you need it. You can get it from Donn Eisele over the next Redstone. [Pause]
Roger. There's no problem there. It's just to run the state vector up. [Pause]
Yes.
I guess I'd like to still keep an iron in the fire on that battarey charge status. [Pause]
Affirmative. We're still working on it. [Pause]
Okay. [Long pause]
Walt, we've got the 101 backup batteries in Downey, and we're running tests on those tonight. [Pause]
Thank you, Ran.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Pause]
There you go - [Pause]
Hell, Ron, tomorrow maybe you can add a Baker-tare update to that. [Pause]
Baker-tare?
That's the other one I mentioned to you. Plus you gave me that for the Lima Sierra. [Long pause]
That is after the slant. [Pause]
Oh, Ron, how about the longitude on that chart update? We missed it. [Pause]
Roger. Just a second. [Long pause]
Roger. REV 68. [Pause]
Roger. Go. [Garble] 107 plus 02 55. What's longitude? [Pause]
Roger. Longitude 15.9 east, right ascension 04 plus 47. [Long pause]
Thank you. 107 02 55 is the time. Right?
That's Roger. And request batt C readout again; misse it last time. [Pause]
Batt C is 36 1 or 2. [Pause]
Roger. 36.4.
36.2.
36.2. Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Houston,'Apollo 7. I'm reading you.
Roger. Good morning. [Pause]
Roger. Haw are you? [Pause]
Getting along in good shape. Donn, on this again, I think that Walt gave me batt Bravo instead of Charlie voltage last time. Request batt Charlie voltage. [Long pause]
Okay. Stand by 1 minute.
Wilco.
Okay. I wonder how much it would foul them up if they delayed eating until they were an TV. [Long pause]
Ron, I read batt C as 36 volts. [Pause]
Roger. I understand. Batt Charlie 36 volts. [Pause]
I think that's down a little; I believe it was about 37 when we first got up here. [Pause]
We concur.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS; Ascension at 23. [Pause]
Roger. Ascension at 23. Understand.
Apollo 7, Houston, Ascension. Standing by. [Pause]
Roger, Houston.
Roger. Loud and clear. [Pause]
Ron, would you log me 15 clicks on water, please. [Pause]
I missed that, Donn. Say again.
Roger. Fifteen. clicks on the water gun.
Roger. Got it.
Okay, I just had a good, solid 8 hours sleep and feel pretty good. I've got a miserable head cold, but other than that, everything's going fine. [Long pause]
Okay. Sounds good, then. [Pause]
My only concern right now is what's going to happen to my ears when we reentry, but I hope by then I'll get over it some. [Pause]
We kind of feel that you will, and we hope, anyhow. [Pause]
I guess we'll cross that when we come to it.
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go.
Roger. We've had a little concern about the voice quality on the DSE there the last couple of dumps, and what we would like you to do is after this pass go ahead aud talk into the tape recorder, mention the time on it, and then give us a time at the next station there, and we can play it back and check it out that way real good. [Long pause]
Roger. You say you want me to record somthing on the tape end read the time onto it so you can check it next pass. Is that right? [Pause]
Affirmative, And then give us a time that you were talking info it. [Pause]
Okay. Will do. [Long pause]
Ron, I've got some results of a sextant star count we did at about 98 hours. [Pause]
Roger. Ready to copy.
At sunris, first off all, the moon was in the field of view, and that tends to vipe out a lot of stars, but at the sunrise, I counted 12 stars, at plus 04 two stars, plus 08 one stars and plus 12 three stars. [Long pause]
Roger. I copy, Donn.
Then they all went away, except a couple of bright ones right after sunrise. At sunset minus 12 four, minus 8 15, minus 4 30, and at sunset, I saw 40 or more. Of course, this was at the other attitude when the Moon was not in the field of view. I could see the constellation Sagittarius very plainly and all the other major stars that appeared in the teleseope at that time. [Long pause]
Roger. [Pause]
I recommend that we knock off the remaining star counts on the basis that we don't need - realy need - to put window shades up to get dark adapted becouse even if you are dark adapted, if you look in a telescope, you get belted with light; it ruins it anyway. And the best way to get dark adapted is to put your eyeball up there and leave it there for several mimutes. [Long pause]
I see. Okay. So the window shades are not doing any good is what you're saying there. Right? [Pause]
I think so; yes. I don't think the window shades would help that much.
Okay.
It's not the sunlight coming in the windows that keeps you from getting dark adapted anyway. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
I had roughly the same sort of light pattern in the telescope that I had an the earlier test. There was a bright ring around the edge of it and a broad bend across the middle off it, and this light pattern didn't disappear in the sunset. [Long pause]
All right.
In fact, on that second check, come to think of it, there wasn't any band across the middle. It was pretty clean scope, and I think it had to do just with the respect to the Earth, how close it is to the direction you're looking. [Long pause]
I understand. [Long pause]
Donn, ...
Yes.
... we never got the sunset - the sunset part of that first star count thing there. If it's convenient in your log, we'll take that. [Long pause]
Roger. I understand you did not get the data on the first one.
We got the suartse part of it, but not the sunset part of it. [Pause]
Roger. At sunset, we had thinning going on, and it wiped it out completely. [Pause]
O, I see. Okay.
There are so many fireflies, snow flakes, out there I couldn't see - tell the stars from the flakes. [Pause]
I understand.
Thirty seconds LOS. We'll pick you up Mercury on the hour. [Pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. stanad by. [Pause]
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Well, I put a short voice recording on the tape about - it was at 108:44. [Pause]
Roger. Copy.
That's give or take a few seconds [garble] I think it was about 108:33:40 actually, but that's the nearest minute. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Go aheed.
Roger. Donn, do you have time to give us a little run down where you found out the best place to sleep is? [Pause]
Yes. We're still sleeping under the couches in space, and that seems to work out best. We've tried free floating and tried keeping strapped down in the sleeping bags, and the latter seems to be better off. I think you can also sleep in the couches if you're strapped down, I guess, but if there's more than one person [garble] you're kind of in the way. The only problem with sleeping under the couch - at least on the right side; I haven't checked the left, but I know on the right - it tends to get hot under there for some reason; not hot, but a little warmer than the rest of the spacecraft. I dont think there's much air circulation. [Long pause]
Roger. Thank you, Donn. We copied. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston.
Hey, good morning.
Mr Eisele.
That's right.
Donn, what's the word - what's the configuation of your window shades when you have both of them asleep? Do you have most of your window shades up? [Pause]
Negative. We haven't even pulled them out of the can the whole flight.
Okay.
It doesn't seem to be a problem when you are asleep; you just try to bury your head under something down under the couch, and you don't even notice the sunlight much. [Pause]
Okay. Let me ask you one other question. Sack this out: what about with respect to that telescope and stars in the daytime; can you ascertain anything at all until you're past the terminator out of the telescope? [Long pause]
No, we started out to - you mean coming into sunset? [Pause]
Yes, in other words, doing a P51 during daytime. [Pause]
Roger. If you lucked out and it happened to end up with the optics pointed at the optimum position - that's, in other words, well away from the Earth and also well away from the Sun - I believe that, say 5 to 10 minutes from sunset or sunrise, you probably could see it. That's last night, at that one setting, [garble] in there, I could have done an alignment; but the problem of the P51 is that we don't have an alignment to start with, and you don't know how to point the thing. [Long pause]
Yes. All right. Real fine. [Pause]
[Garble] got, if you already had an alignment, you'd just rather do a fine align; you can do that okay. [Garble] and I have seen a number of stars in the sextant during daylight. [Long pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Pause]
Roger.
AOS Redstone at 32. [Pause]
Roger. Roger. See you at Redstone. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. [Pause]
Roger, Houston.
Roger. Reading you about three-by, Donn. [Pause]
[Garble] got both hands full and the mike slipped. Is that better? [Pause]
Say again slower; I couldn't read you. [Pause]
All right. Disregard. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read? [Pause]
Loud and clear.
Okay. You're coming in loud and clear. While we have some quiet time, I would just like to ask you a couple more of questions, Donn. When you're in the local horizontal attitude, can you observe the horizons out the rendezvous windows below you? [Long pause]
You mean how far below the X-axis can you see?
Yes.
I don't know. I've newer been precisely in that attitude to look. I don't believe you can, though. [Pause]
Okay. Well look. one ...
[Garble] I'm not shure, Tom, we haven't really done any precise local horizontal maneuvers yet. [Pause]
Okay. Well. down the line in the next day or so, if you get a chance, I wish you would do that so we can get our simulators calibrated. And, also, out the side windows - the 1 and 5 window when you're in local horizontal - if you will just make a pencil makk there, we can then get our simulators calibrated to that. [Long pause]
Okay. A good time to do that may be in the land mark tracking, because we'll be lined up with local horizontal anyway. [Pause]
Okay. If you can, just make a note of that and check because it will sure help us on getting these - you know, quantative data for the simulators and also to pass on to the other crews. [Pause]
Okay. Will do. Incidentally, the optics of the simulator are pretty realistic. What I'm seeing through these optics in here are almost identical with respect to star visibility so on. [Long pause]
Oh, okay. Particularly with the telescope, what we see in the telescope is about what you've got there in flight, Donn. [Pause]
That's exactly right. You have to keep your eyeball in there for several minutes before you can begin to see any stars. [Pause]
I see.
[Garble] using the telescope.
Okay.
[Garble] out the windows.
Okay. That is even at nighttime too, huh?
That's right.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Oh, hi, Bill. I just checked the Command Module RCS temperatures, and all six of them are pegged at 5 volts plus. [Long pause]
Roger. Understand. All the CM RC - CM RCS temps are pegged at 5 volts plus. [Pause]
That's right.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Redstone; Ascension on the hour. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Honston through Ascension. [Pause]
Roger, Bill. Apollo 7.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Houston. Go.
Roger. Could you give us an estimate on the time the CDR and LMP went to sleep? [Long pause]
Yes. Stand by; I'm looking at the log here.
Say again, please? [Garble]. [Long pause]
I think it was 109 hours, 108 hours. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. [Pause]
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7. [Pause]
It looks like we both have the night watch. [Pause]
Yes, it works out that way, doesn't it? [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Roger, Houston. 7. Go.
Say, I have a procedure here an this television operation which I'm just gonna pass up so you don't need to write it down. It's pretty simple. It involves a technique to get the best TV picture, and it sort of goes like this. When holding the TV, duaring the next TV period, take a look at the position of the AL switch and report the position. That's probably before you start taking the television pictures. Then about onehalf way through, during the period of television, change the position of this AL switch. The AL stands for auto light, although it isn't automatic. [Long pause]
Okay. I got you.
And...
Using the AL light.
All right. They will be coordinating with you from the ground. Also, another point, it takes the TV about 90 seconds to warm up, about a mimute and a half to warm up. [Long pause]
I see. Okay. We'll keep that in mind.
Right. Thank you. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. We would like to turn the O2 tank fans on for 5 minutes and then off. I'll remind you just about LOS. [Long pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. I may have passed that up incorrectly. If I said OFF, it should be ON. Turn them on for 5 minutes and then off. [Pause]
Roger. I got you; keep going now.
Apollo 7, Houston. Say, Donn, we're not getting anything on the BIOMED. Have you changed anything? [Pause]
Roger. I'll have it on in a couple of minutes.
Okay. Thank you. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni, please. Also, I have a little bit more information on that television. That AL stands for automatic light control. It's similar to automatic gain control in an electronic circuit, apparently, and it prevents a bright light source from sort off washing out the picture.
Roger. Go and understand.
Thank you. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up on LOS; Canaries at36. [Pause]
Roger. Read you. [Pause]
And you can turn the number 2 CRYO fan back off. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Through Canary I have a request. I would like a reading on pyro batt A, B, and batt C. [Long pause]
Roger. Batt C is 36.0 volts. [Pause]
36.0.
Stand by far the pyros.
Roger. [Long pause]
Bill, I'm reading 37.0 volts for both pyros. [Pause]
Roger. 37.0. In that position are you leaving the DC indicatar? [Pause]
Oh, it varies. I usually leave it on one of the main bus voltages. [Pause]
Good. That is what we'd like, main A or main B. [Pause]
Roger.
Thank you. [Long pause]
Hey, Bill.
Roger.
Ask the tower if they've got a recomended flap setting, too. [Pause]
Okay, will, and you might check the friction in the throtlle there. [Pause]
Roger. (Laughter) [Pause]
When I shake the stick mobile, you've got it. [Pause]
It says use plenty.
Apono 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Pause]
Roger.
Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Canary; Honeysuckle at 23. [Pause]
Roger. Honeysuckle at 23.
Roger.
Do you want S-band up far that?
(Laughter) Roger. S-band up for that one. [Pause]
Okay.Right.
Apo]lo 7, Houston through Honeysuckle. [Pause]
Bill. [Pause]
Okay.
Apollo 7. Houston through Redstone. I have a Flight Plan update when you're ready to copy. [Long pause]
Roger. Houston, go ahead with your flight update. Also would like to enter map update when you get through with this one. [Pause]
Roger. I'll give you a map update as soon I get through with the Flight Plan. [Long pause]
Bill, would you log me 40 clicks with the water pistol and two aspirin, please? [Pause]
How many clicks?
40.
Roger. Forty clicks on the water and two aspirins. [Pause]
In 4 hours. [Pause]
The Flight Plan update will start at 115 plus 10. CMC power up. [Long pause]
Roger.
Okay. You can delete the reference to CMC power up at 117 pins 20. [Long pause]
[Garble].
Roger. At 118 plus 00, add fuel cell O2 purge, also unstow and set up TV. That's at 118 plus 00 hours. [Long pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Next item is at 119 plus 04. TV ON. [Pause]
Roger. TV ON at 119 04. Do you want us to turn it on 90 seconds before that, and let it warm up, or is that the turnon time you want? [Long pause]
Roger. That'll take care of it. The Texas AOS is 119 plus 06, Texas acquisition at 119 plus 06, and sorry to interrupt, but we need oposite omni. [Long pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
And, Donn, you can let me know when you're ready to resume copy of Flight Plan update. [Pause]
Roger. I'm all ready.
Okay. At 119 plus 30, SCS attitude reference check previously scheduled at 89 hours and 50 minutes, 89 plus 50. That's just for information. And we'd like that SCS attitude reference check starting at 119 plus 30 at 30-minute intervals up to the time of the burn. [Long pause]
Roger. You want that at 30-minute intervals to burn time. [Pause]
So if you want to, make a tick at 120 plus 00 and 120 plus 30. [Long pause]
Okay.
Okay. The notation is 121 hours in reference to SPS burn 4; the time is 120 plus 43. [Long pause]
Roger. Understand that you're going to burn at 120 plus 43. [Pause]
Roger. And over there in the box where it says two-jet ullage , you can write in quads Bravo and Delta, quads B and D. [Long pause]
Roger. We got you on that.
Roger. And you can delete the line in reference to initiate battery charging. [Pause]
Okay. Got that.
Delete the half box in reference to the star count test there, the telescope star count test, sun line of sight, et cetera. [Long pause]
Roger.
Under the line where it says MCC update, add "For landmark tracking." You will receive an update for landmark tracking at that time. [Long pause]
Understand landmark tracking update.
Roger. And at 121 plus 20, P52 option 3. [Long pause]
Roger. [Pause]
At 121 plus 40, state vector voice update. [Long pause]
You say state vector voice updtate?
Affirmative.
What's that for?
Stand by. That's for the landmark tracking, in case you need it. [Pause]
Can't you uplink' it?
If required. That's in case you need it for the landmark tracking, it's not ... Roger. In case anything happens during the landmark tracking, you'll have a state vector to fall back on. [Long pause]
Oh, I get you.
Okay. You can delete the reference to the star count test 3 at 122 hours. Apolo 7, we're coming up on LOS Redstone. I'll pick you up at Antigua for the rest of the Flight Plan update. [Long pause]
Roger.
Antigua at 58.
Antigua at 58; understand.
Apollo 7, Houston. If you're still reading, the map update is REV 72, node 112 plus 56 plus 50, 74.9 degrees west.
Apollo 7, Houston through Antigua. [Pause]
Roger. Houston.
Roger. I'll go ahead with the Flight Plan update. Before I start, did you read the map update? [Pause]
I got as far as REV 72 and 112 plus 56. [Pause]
Okay. REV 72, 112 plus 56 plus 50, nodal crossing at 74.9 west. [Long pause]
Roger. Fifty-six plus 50 and then 74.9 west. [Pause]
Roger. And continuing with the Flight Plan update at 122 hours. [Long pause]
Roger. Go.
Roger. At 122 hours, delete the three references, H2 heaters ON, telescope star count, and fuel cell purge. Add. at 122 hours, 222 ORB NAV (except marks). At 122 plus 20, P23 update, star and gimbal angles.:+:+:-:-:-
Roger. At 112 plus 20, you got a P - what happened at 122? What did. you say about the landmarks again? I didn't get that. [Long pause]
Okay. That was not landmarks. Perhaps it is sufficient just to say at 122 hours P22 ORB NAV, and at 122 plus 20, P23 update. [Long pause]
Does that mean you want me to do a P - orbital navigation at 122? [Pause]
Affirmative. [Pause]
Now let's - okay. I don't get it. You want me to do an ORB NAV from 122 on to sometime, and also duaring that period, you are going to be reading updates to us? [Long pause]
Well, at 122 plus 20, there will be a P23 update star and gimbal angles. [Pause]
Okay. I figure that might be better off a little later after we get done with my orbital NAV. [Pause]
Okay. Let's talk about it in just a minute. Let me go ahead and go through the rest of the updates. At 123 hours, delete the reference to COAS calibration. At 123 plus 30, add P23 star horizon sightings. [Long pause]
You can delete the reference to the attitude control tests that occur at about 123 plus 45. [Long pause]
Roger.
At 124 plus 20, add G&N SCS power down, and delete the reference to P54 COAS evaluation. [Long pause]
Roger, Bll.
Okay.
Go ahead.
At 125 plus 30, delete the reference to P23. [Pause]
Roger.
And that is the end of the update. Let me check on this other thing. [Pause]
Okay. How long of this pass is this ORB NAV supposed to take? [Pause]
All right. Stand by. [Pause]
The ORB NAV takes one daylight pass. [Pause]
Roger. That is what what I thought.
Okay. And you are thinking that the P23 update is going to catch you right in the midle there. [Pause]
It shouldn't be too bad. Walt can probably write it down while we,re doing the rest of it. [Pause]
Okay.
How come you moved the P23 up 2 hours?. Is that to get done so we can get to bed? [Pause]
Affirmative.
I see.
We're coming up on LOS. And one other quick item - we just want to - at the point - at the risk of belaboring a point, Donn and Wally's - correction, Wally and Wart's sleep period lasts until 116 plus 00 hours. [Pause]
Roger. I got that. [Long pause]
We will have Canaries at 09. [Pause]
Okay. I'll see you then.
Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston through Canary. [Pause]
Roger, Bill.
Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up 1 min-ute LOS Canary; Carnarvon at 46 [Pause]
Roger.
113 hours 37 minutes; took four pictures of southern tip of India and Ceylon.
Frame numbers were 78, 79, 80, and 81, magazine F.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Carnarvon. S-band volume up at 53 for Honeysuckle. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Honeysuckle.
Apollo 7, Houston through Honeysuckle. [Pause]
Roger. Apollo 7. Read you.
Roger. [Pause]
Bill, would you log me another 24 clicks of water, please? [Pause]
Roger. Twenty-four clicks. Thank you.
Hey, Donn, how you feeling? [Pause]
Say again, Bill.
How you feeling today?
Oh, pretty fair.
Good.
I've got kind of a head cold, but other than that, everything's fine. [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
Just sitting here doing my daily dozen.
Oh, good. [Pause]
That's my only chance. Those other guys get up, and they monopolize it. [Pause]
Yes, I saw them on television this morning. [Pause]
Say again.
I saw them using the exerciser on television this morning. [Pause]
Oh, is that right?
Roger. Rubber-necking just like everyone else. [Pause]
Right. [Long pause]
Apollo 7. Houston. One minute LOS; Carnarvon at 14 - Redstone at 14. [Pause]
Roger. Thought maybe we were turning around abd going the other wat for a minute.
That's a pretty good trick if you can pull it off. Might wake the other fellows, though. [Pause]
Right.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston, Go.
Roger. I was just looking over this Flight Plan for the 8-hour active period. Looks like we're pretty well booked up. I guess the point I wanted to make is that the burn is to be the event of the day, and I take it that if we get behind or have any problems, we'll probably drop some of these other thing if we need to? [Long pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Redstone; Bagama at 31. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Antigua. [Pause]
Roger, Houston. Apollo 7.
Roger. Donn, I'd like a readout on batt C - Charlie - voltage. [Pause]
Roger. That's 36 volts. [Pause]
Thirty-six. Thank you. Also, Donn, I've been taking a look at the Flight Plan. And it may look a bit crowded, but we think everything could be gotten in there in the normal course of events in getting ready for the burn. However, we have looked at a couple of things here that could be deleted without affecting anything. First off, if you start getting crowded, you can scrub the photography entries, which sort of goes without saying. Second, you can scrub the SCS attitude reference check. And third, delete the P22 exercises associated with P52. [Long pause]
Roger.
You know, if you get in a bind. [Long pause]
Yes, I think we can get through it okay, Bill. I just wanted to point out that if we do get behind and if we do have any problem we we'll probably drop them. [Pause]
Roger. The point is well taken.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Antigua; Canary 43. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Canary. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go.
Say, Bill, insteadof powering up at 115:10 and doing a P23 trunion check, I think I'd just as soon wait and do that at the time we do the start of horizon landmark business - start of horizon navigation. [Long pause]
Roger.
In other words, I don't see any point in powering and maneuvering around to do one lettle check ... [Pause]
Right.
... when it would be easier to do the same thing a little later - catch them all at the same time. Probably.
Apollo 7, Houston. Regarding the power up at the latter time: just before the new state vector is agreeable here. [Long pause]
Okay.
And we'll change our Flight Plan accordingly.
Right.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Canary. We'll have onother minute at Madrid if you turn the S-band volume up if you need to call us. [Long pause]
Okay. [Pause]
And Carnarvon at 18. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Roger. Would you log me another 30 clicks of water? [Pause]
Say again the number.
Three-zero.
Roger. Three-zero.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Carnarvon; Honeysuckle at 26 so you can turn up your S-band volume in about 1 minute. [Long pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Request O2 tank 2 fans ON 5 minutes then off. [Pause]
Roger, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
Roger, Houston. Go.
Roger. I'm not shure I'll have the full time on this pass because of the keyhole. I'll have a block data for you at Texas, and we'll have Texas on the hour. [Long pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up on LOS Honeysuckle. You can get the fans back OFF in about half a minute. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7. Houston through Texas.
Roger.
Roger. I have a block data update when you are ready to copy. [Pause]
Stand by, Bill. [Long pause]
Go ahead with the update, Bill.
Roger. Block data: 075 dash 1 Alpha plus 311 minus 0650 117 24 04 3443, 076 dash 1 Alpha plus 302 minus 0650 119 00 11 3592. [Long pause]
Roger.
077 dash 1 Alpha plus 238 minus 0630 120 33 36 2888, 078 dash 4 Alpha plus 310 minus 1600 123 17 25 3410, 079 dash 4 Alpha plus 307 minus 1600 124 53 43 3520, 080 dash 4 Alpha plus 263 minus 1611 126 27 32 3137. Read back.
Roger. [Long pause]
075 dash 1 Alpha plus 311 minus 0650 177 24 04 3443, 076 dash 1 Alpha - I'll have to get the lat and long again from you - The time was 11900 11 3592, 077 1 Alpha plus 238 plus 0630 120 33 36 2888, 78 dash 4 Alpha plus 310 minus 1600 123 17 25 3410, 079 dash 4 Alpha plus 307 minus 1600 124 53 43 3520, 080 dash 4 Alpha plus 263 minus 1611 126 27 32 3137.
Roger. On the first block, the time was 117 plus 24 plus 04. [Long pause]
Roger. I got that.
Roger. And on the next block, the lat and long are plus 302 minus 0650. [Long pause]
Okay. Plus 302 minus 0650. [Pause]
Roger. And the fourth block: 078 minus 4 Alpha; the long is minus 1600. [Pause]
Roger. Minus 1600.
Roger. Readback is correct.
Okay. Thanks. [Long pause]
Go. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. You're GO for 92 dash 1. [Pause]
Roger. You're GO for 92-1.
Houston, Apollo 7. [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Roger. Would you log me one Lomatil, please? [Pause]
Would you say again, please? [Pause]
Roger. About half hour ago, I took one Lomatil [garble] [Pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. I'm having difficulty reading you. [Pause]
Roger. Understand.
Now you're very clear. Would you say again, please?
Roger. About 30 minutes ago, I took one Lomatil. Would you please log that? [Pause]
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston through Canary.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Canary; Carnarvon at 52. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
Go ahead, Houston.
Good morning, Donn. How are you this morning.
Oh, just fine, Jack. Just had a flight with this computer here. [Pause]
Roger. Donn, would like to get a battery C voltage readout here at Carnarvon. [Pause]
Roger. Battery C is showing 36.5, and good morning, Jack. [Pause]
Good morning, Walt, and how are you? [Pause]
Fine.
And we're going to be sending you a state vector and target load over Texas, and I'll have the memeuver PAD and NAV check to pass up to you. [Long pause]
Roger. At the same time?
Roger. And one other thing I wanted to discuss with you here at this time is the TV went over so well yesterday, we'd like to know if you could save one of your breakfast packages to demonstrate eating on television this morning? [Long pause]
We'll give them something interesting, but we'll probably be mostly through breakfast by then. If we have any food left, we will eat it for the audience. [Pause]
Okay. Would appreciate it if you could do it. [Pause]
We're going to eat - we're starting our breakfast now, Jack, and we're not going to want to schedule things around that TV cemera. [Pause]
Okay. Understand.
What's the news this morning, Jack? [Pause]
I'm getting it summarized now. Will be passing it up to you in a little bit. We'll pick up Honeysucle here. Walt, at 117:00. You want to turn up your S-band? [Long pause]
117:00. We'll turn up the S-band.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Looks like your primary evaporator is drying out again. [Pause]
You know, that thing runs fine all night long until you guys come on. [Pause]
Maybe it's me. [Pause]
That started down this pass, didn't it? [Long pause]
Jack, about that: Walt's just come on, too.
Good morning, Wally. Could we get you to set down the primary evaporator to go to DECREASE on the back pressure switch? And do not reservice it at this time. [Long pause]
You want another increase, don't you? I'm shutting it down, now.
Excuse me. INCREASE on the back pressure swich. [Pause]
That's in work. Whenever it dried out, I go ahead and close it up. You don't want it reserviced now? [Pause]
That is affirmative. [Long pause]
What we would like to do is have the reservice take place 117 plus 15. [Long pause]
Roger. Is that to be over a station, or do you just want me to write it down? [Pause]
You can do it on your own.
Okay. I'll give it 2 minutes of water at 117:15.
10 clicks of water for LMP.
On the sausage patties on the first series, I did not get enough water in it and could not eat it. This time I doubled the water supply [garble] and it looks eatable.
Apollo 7, Houston through Guaymas.
Roger. Ready to copy that data. [Pause]
Okay. The maneuver PAD: SPS4, minimum impulse 12043 all balls plus 00129 minus all balls minus all balls 1563 plus 0901 000 78 29705 minus 085 minus 055 burn time 000 42 1161 321 120 00 0000 minus 3103 plus 09634 1417; roll, pitch, and yaw are all balls. Remarks: heads-up, SES posigrade, the sextant star not visible after 120 plus 20 plus 00.
Roger. Jack, nice speed up that. Readback as follows: SPS4 12043 0000 00129 minus 5 balls minus five balls 1563 plus 0901 00078 29705 minus 085 minus 055 000 42 1161 321 120 two balls four balls minus 3103 plus 09634 1417; all balls on the attitude, heads-up, SES posigrade, the sextant star before 120 plus 20. Over. [Long pause]
That is affirmative. I have the morning news for you. [Pause]
Go ahead.
GO ahead. We're all on.
Apollo 7, before that, could we get you to go to ACCEPT, so we'll send up your target load and state vector? [Pause]
Roger. We're drinking our mornining coffee.
Roger. The Supreme Court acts of yesterday now assuare that all 50 states will have three candidates to pick from for the November election. The headlines this morning says, "Apollo 7 Sails On." And there is a picture of Harriet Eisele watchin the TV pass from the viewing room here at MCC. And at the Olympics, Al Herter became the first athlete in history to win a fourt gold medal. He has won the discus event in every Olympics since 1966, and that's about it from friendly newscaster. [Long pause]
Thank you, Jack. I aprectate that. Thanks, Jack.
Roger.
It seems like Mr. Herter is a very durable athlete.
He sure is.
Apollo 7. Houston.
Go ahead, Jack.
Roger. Guaymas has a visual sightings of you as you passed over. [Pause]
Very good. We have a picture - a couple of visuals of them. [Pause]
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. We have finished our update. The computer is yours. [Pause]
Thank you, Jack. [Long pause]
We'll buy it.
Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS Bermuda; Canaries at 117 plus 51. [Pause]
Roger. See you then.
Apollo 7, Houston through the Canaries. Standing by. [Pause]
Roger, Jack. How come we don't have our tape running? [Pause]
Stand by. [Pause]
Jack, while you are there, observe our pitch rate at this time. [Pause]
Okay. Stand by. I don't have that display called up, Wally. Just a minute. [Pause]
This is one of those free pitch rates again.
Ah so.
We are pretty well convinced that this machine does not want to fly X-axis vertical, either down or up. [Pause]
Copy that.
And that's how we get these gimbal locks in once in a while without even suspecting it - or a lot off rapid change of attitude. I think you can see my pitch rate will start decreasing; it's in four-tenths of a degree per second, and I have no pitch in. [Long pause]
Okay. I'm watching it now. [Pause]
All my chanels are off. Now should I go to - you want GDC on number 1 ball; is that what it is? [Pause]
Affirmative. [Pause]
I'll have to align it. [Long pause]
We'll give you 1620; you can watch that. [Pause]
Okay. [Long pause]
The computer's busy thinking the thing over. [Pause]
Had a pitch rate decreasing there; don't know if you can see that.
Roger. I can see that.
I didn't do a thing to it. It's not transferring, not to another; that's another point. [Pause]
Okay. Copy that. [Pause]
I could have blown a lot of fuel trying to do that. [Pause]
Roger. Copy.
But it wasn't worthwhile that we explore this one on this mission. I'm getting pitch towards zero for nothing. [Long pause]
Wally, your X-axis now pointed heads down toward the Eearth? [Pause]
Generally towards the Earth; that's right. We are - the S-IV - the big engine is sort of ahead of us, and our - the plus X is sort of trailing. You got the angles now. Now you notice the rates are almost stopped, and I haven't done anything to the spacecraft. [Long pause]
Okay.
Can you give us a chart update when you get a chance, Jack?
In work. [Long pause]
Roger. Walt, I have the chart update. [Pause]
Go ahead.
Okay. For REV 74, the time of the node 117 plus 23 plus 02, longitude 143.1 degrees west, right ascension of 04 plus 34. [Long pause]
Jack, now notice this, zero yaw rate, zero pitch rate. [Pause]
I got 117 plus 23 plus 02, 143.1 west, and 04 plus 33 right ascension. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Hey, Jack. Frame 86, magazine S: ground formation over the western end of Africa. [Long pause]
You read, Jack?
Roger. Walt, we are about 15 second LOS Canaries; Tananarive at 118 plus 21. [Pause]
Roger.
Magazine S. Frame 86.
A ground formation, west end of Africa.
At about 116:20, magazine S, frame 86, taken over the desert, the western end of Africa, a ground formation just past the Canaries.
Correction on that time - it was 117 hours 57 minutes and 30 seconds.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Go ahead.
Houston, Apollo 7. We read you.
Roger. Wally, we have been doing some looking into this torque business; there have been some calculation made that show that there is a five to tenths of a foot-pound torque possible going through perigee when you're broadside - going through perigee broadside to the direction of flight. This produces a possible rate of .03 degrees per second per second in pitch due to drag. I would like to ask you if this torquing rate that you experienced exists throughout a complete revolution, or is more pronounced - noticeable - at perigee only? [Long pause]
We have already discovered it's more pronounced at perigee; we were thinking here last night going across the States and across the Atlantic, and we could see it more strongly. Had a tendency to put a pitch up; it didn't matter what the roll was. As we came across perigee, we started torquing right back, and we tended to go in RCS most of the time. [Long pause]
Okay. Copy. And we do have some more information on your secondary switchover. [Long pause]
Go.
Okay. Our best data for your onboard gage readings for secondary tanks switchover are as follows. Are you ready to copy? [Long pause]
Go.
Okay. Quad A 46 percent; Quad B switch with tank quad D Dog; quad C Charlie 54 percent; quad D 49 percent; at present, quad C is the closest to switchover, the predicted switchover time should be approximately 140 hours GET. [Long pause]
Roger. And our meter readings are 46; Baker goes with Dog; 54 and 49 percent; we should switch over quads when they are indicating that to us? Over. [Long pause]
That's affirmative, 7. [Pause]
Thank you. [Long pause]
Hey, Jack, has that corelation between our onboard readings and the actual quantities been fairly consistent - with regard to the quantities coming down? [Long pause]
That's affirmative, Walt. We think the numbers we have passed you are pretty good numbers right now. [Pause]
Thank you. [Long pause]
O2 purge will be complete in 30 seconds.
Apollo 7. Houston. About 20 seconds LOS Tananarive; Carnarvon at 118 plus 26.
Roger.
O2 purge is complete.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger. Standing by.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Carnarvon. Would you turn up S-band for contact with Honeysuckle? [Pause]
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. I've got four balls 5 for triangle difference on Rigel - I've got five balls, excuse me, on Rigel and Sirius, and you're reading the torquing angles now. [Long pause]
Affirmative. We followed you all the way through 52 there, Donn. [Pause]
This is not the regular navigator. [Pause]
Okay. [Pause]
This is the alternative navigator.
Roger. Copy.
The torquing angles are 00007, minus 00011, plus 00007. We're on VERB 6, NOUN 93 on the final line of [garble] 15.
The time, 118 hours and 40 minutes.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. Standing by.
Roger. [Garble].
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Roger. Are you receiving our program?
It's not comig through yet, Donn. [Pause]
Roger.
Are you picking up anything, Jack?
Not yet, Donn. We're just about to get our handover to Texas. We should be picking up shortly. [Pause]
I see. Okay. We're not there yet. [Pause]
Wally's complayning. He says he's got a sinus that's getting heavy. [Pause]
Copy that. [Long pause]
Still nothing yet, Donn. [Long pause]
Apollo 7. Opposite omni. [Pause]
Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Could you switch to the omni antenna in between? [Pause]
Roger. [Pause]
There it is; there it is.
Okay.
Jack, are you receiving the picture now?
We're receiving the picture; it's a little bright. Could you bring it in a little? Roger. From_ the lovely Apollo Room high atop everything. [Long pause]
Roger. This is your captain speaking on this flight, and you can unfasten your seat belts and relax, and we hope we can make this flight enjoyable for you. At this time, we would like to demonstrate one of our minor problems here; in fact, I should tell you what time it is. Just one moment, and we'll get a compuiter on the line here. [Long pause]
It's in ENTER now.
Okay. We'll reset that. [Pause]
He's getting GET up. [Pause]
And we now have our time counting. It is 119 hours 9 minutes and some odd seconds into the flight. One of our problems at this time is making note of the small arrow here; we're not sure what it means in that up is not necessarily up or down, but we we'll discuss that at a later time. What you just observed was a fumbling attempt to get the keyboard working on our DSKY, which is our display keybord; and the numbers you are reading is the time generated from the onboard computer. I'd now like to show you Walt Cunningham preparing some our food at our food station. I'll bring you in close to show you what our food stations have. We have two buttons: the upper button is COLD, the lower is HOT; and there is a spout that Wally is now uncovering. When we depress the button, with the appropriate container over the silver spout, we deliver 1 ounce of water, be it hot or cold. At this time, Walt will get some of the food. One of the nice features of the food preparation on this flight is - a nice feature about the food is that we have hot water, and this this makes the food much more enjouyable and quite palatable. We are using a pair of surgical shears to cut open the upper portion of the plastic bag, and we pry open the spout, which will then interface with the tap. At this point, Walt is applying it to the tap. On this trip, we use cold water. We are reconstituting some fruit juice. You see him depress the button, and each depression supplies 1 ounce of cold water. This water is quite delightful. It's cold as hell; it's about 50 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit. At first, we were adding chlorine to the water daily to be sure there were no contaminations or bacteria that would develop in the water. This left a rather bad aftertaste. We are now adding chlorine approximately every other day.
He is now adding 5 ounces of water. You may notice the bubbles that are in the bag. There's a little bit of gas in the water; this does not cause us too much problems. If you get a lot of gas it does, and we have to clean the gas back out again. Fortunately, this has not happened too often. Then, the next step is to knead the bag; this mixes the powder concentrate with the water; and then we end up with a complete drink. We may have a zero-g demonstration available for you here, where we can spin the bag, and you will notice the bubbles are sort of breaking and falling apart. They do not form a solid mass of bubbles, but you can see in the center a rather interesting formation of bubbles. [Long pause]
I'd like to pass the camera now to Donn Eisele. I'd like to try to show you the problem we have with the water condensation underneath on the other panel. Here goes the camera to Donn. [Long pause]
While Wally is getting under the couch to demonstrate the suction that we use to clean up the water that has been accumulated on the cold pipes, I'll describe the systen that we do have. We have an overboard dump hose, which dumps the liquid we have in the spacecraft overboard through a heated vent; that hose has been passed to Donn, and he has a purge fitting attached to the end of it. I'm now going to go to the dump position on the waste management system, and Wally will be vacuuming up some water while Donn and I throw lighte on it. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. Could you give us the position of the switch on the TV camera? [Pause]
ALC is OUT.
We would like to switch that position to IN, to the ALC position. [Pause]
Roger. Is your picture satisfactory? [Pause]
It's a good picture; we're trying to improve it a little. [Pause]
Roger. We're trying to show you a picture of a plumbing fitting that has a lot of water on it, clinging to it. Can you see the water on the fitting? [Long pause]
Can you see the water on the fitting, Jack?
We're looking; don't quite see it. [Pause]
Okay. Can you see the fitting?
Affirmative. Could you go back to the OUT position? [Pause]
It's always worked better in the OUT position. Maybe you will see it when he starts sucking it up. [Pause]
Okay. Now he's going to suck up the water with the vacuum line we have. It's very, very small vacuum, but so far, it seems to have worked pretty well at taking water overboard. It's a pretty good size blob of water that's - yes - takes quite awhile. Are you observing that, Jack? [Long pause]
Affirmative. We got you five-by. We've got about another minute and a half of picture here. [Pause]
Okay. Okay. This is part of our regular preparation for a burn now, is to clean off what water we can see because after an SPS burn it seems to end up on the aft bulkhead. This water is formed by condensing on the cold glycol lines. Donn will finish out the run by showing you the MDC in front of the comander's station. Go ahead and talk, Donn. [Long pause]
All right. This is the comnander's station. The left-seat drivers controls the attitude of the spacecraft and also the operation of the main system. [Long pause]
This instrument in the middle is the heart of the whole thing, really. It is called Flight Director Attitude Indicator which is comparable to the artificial horizon in an airplane, exept that it operates in all three axes instead of just two. These various switches control the configuration of the manual attitude control system. We can hold an attitude, or we can free drift. We can have two or three modes to use the handcontroller. This is the handcontroller that you use to slide the spacecraft around various attitudes manually. These switches here control the electronics and whether or not the signals get from the handcontroller out to the little jets to fire them.
Are you still picking up the picture, Jack?
Negative. We just lost the picture. That was a real good demonstration of your little home there. [Pause]
Roger. See you tomorow, same time, same station.
Apollo 7. One minute LOS Bermuda. [Long pause]
We pick you up at Tananarive at 119 plus 43. [Pause]
Roger.
And, Walt, Low was in the viewing room, saw it all, sends you regards. [Pause]
Oh, thank you very much, Jack.
Jack, could you get a view of that water blob down there?
We couldn't pick up the water itself very closely, but we saw approximately what you were vacuuming. [Pause]
Okay. That's one of the areas; there are a number of them where they collect. There is one right inside where the steam duct is; I'm in there now. There's a real big blob of water. [Long pause]
Roger. Copy. we'll see you at Tananarive.
Apollo 7. Houston through Tananarive. [Pause]
Roger, Houston.
We're standing by.
Houston, Apollo 7. [Pause]
Go ahead, 7.
Roger. What are you doing about putting the water boiler back on here?
(Laughter) [Pause]
Walt, the COMM is real bad here at Tananarive. I could hardly make you out. Could you say again? [Pause]
Okay. It's a question of putting the water boiler back on the line. [Pause]
(Laughter)
Stand by. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston. You can bring the water boiler back on the line. We will take a look at it over Carnarvon at 120 plus 00. [Pause]
Roger. We'll put it back.
Roger.
ARIA 2, go REMOTE. [Pause]
ARIA 2 has AOS. ARIA 2 has AOS.
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 2. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 2. [Long pause]
Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 2.
