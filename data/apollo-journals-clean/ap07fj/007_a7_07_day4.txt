Apollo 7, Houston through Canary.
Roger. Go.
Roger. I read you five-by.
Jack, would you say again the burn time for burn3?
Roger. 75:48. We're going to be sending you up some NAV loads, and I'll be passing you up a maneuver PAD here.
Fine.
Apollo 7, Houston. If you will go to ACCEPT, we'll send you up a NAV load.
Roger. ACCEPT.
Okay. Walt, you might let me know when you're ready to copy your maneuver PAD.
Copy.
Roger. SPS 3, 075 47 5860 minus 00550 plus 02000 plus 00410 1601 plus 0903 02007 30584 minus 086 minus 046 0 plus 0930 3484, 323 075 05 all balls plus 1330 minus 05642 1256 000 000 and 000. Remarks: SCS control 20 seconds two-jet ullage using quads B and D. You will be out of plane to the south, slightly retrograde, slightly pitch down; the sextant star will not be visible after 075 plus 35 plus 00.
Roger. I'll hit the remarks first. We won't be doing a two-jet ullage on SCS burn, Jack, and burn 3, 075 47 5860 minus 00550 plus 02000 plus 00410 1601 plus 0903 02007 30584 minus 086 minus 046 009 30 3484 323 075 05 0000 plus 1330 minus 05642 1256; all ball on the roll, pitch, and yaw. It's SCS burns for 20 seconds, and you called two-Jet ullage. That's a negative on the two-Jet ullage. Out-of-plane south slightly retrograde and sextant star before 75 hours 35 minuutes.
Roger. The reason we are doing a two-jet ullage, Walt, is to even up the RCS fuel. When we do this, all the quads will be even, and we will be in fat shape for an SCS RCS deorbit redline.
You said a two-jet RCS, Jack, using two quads. We can't do it.
Jack, the only two-jet ullage we're going to do is on a G&N burn.
Roger. We'll come back with you over that, over Tananarive. And we have the load in, verified; the computer is yours.
Houston, Apollo 7. We have a NAV check.
Roger. Say again.
Go ahead.
From the period of 70 hours through approximately 72 hours, the timeline was rather awkward in that we had a problem with the MARK button on the computer. The whole team on board was a little behind the curve. They were sleeping well, finally, and I wanted for them to sleep awhile. We needed three men really to hook up the events in that - in a really effective time. The state vectors we were working normally would have been a very simple task for one man to run.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear.
You're five-by. On the - on this two-jet ullage: Wally, we felt that we could do a two-jet SCS ullage, RCS ullage, and save about 8 pounds of RCS fuel. You can do this by having the pitch and yaw channel switches at A and pulling pitch main A circuit breaker. How do you feel about that?
We've got to fly attitude energy, Jack, and that 20 seconds that will give you a pretty tight burn.
You will still have two-jet ullage attitude hold.
The main thing is I don't think a G&N burn will conserve fuel anyway.
Okay. If you are uncomfortable about it, we will go with the four jets. We just thought we could save about 8 pounds of fuel.
Okay. We will go four jets.
Okay. Understand.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. Wally, on this AC glitch, what they are doing is - we have a series of tests being run off line first, but we're using 106 at the factory to check out all the AC systems in the sensing system. At the Beach, they are testing the whole lashup, the CRYO stands, heaters, and everything; and we should have some data on this by tomorrow.
Okay. Tom, I think you should realize that all that trouble of going to the hybrid gears is that kind of glitch coming along.
That's right, and that is why we just decided to go ahead and do this burn 3 and get the perigee down.
Okay. We will be doing two jet here; we will have to kick it over for a while.
Okay. Then we have got plenty of time to pick it up later. No problem on that.
Okay.
And they don't plan - they are not suggesting running any test on hoard up there, what with the AC power. We will do it all on the ground and tell you what we find out.
Okay. We are knocking off all the fuels since we want to stay out of gimbal lock.
Say again.
We are knocking off all fuels except for one in gimbal lock.
Okay. What we are going to do is delete for the present all flight plan items after 72 hours to prepare for this burn.
Concur.
Debriefing on the period from 70 hours to 72 hours: as a result of the delayed pickup of the total crew, the events snowballed, and we fell behind on the alignment. We did manage to get the canister change number 6 completed on time. About this time, we were getting some help on the problem that we're supposed to...
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute to LOS Tananarive; we will pick up ARIA 2 in about 2 minutes and then on through to Carnarvon.
Roger.
And as a result of this, the rendezvous transponder test was pretty well blown apart. We did manage to get the TV camera out, in that that would seem to be the big crisis ever since launch day.
We did attempt, and wasted some fuel, on the alignment. Finally, I noted the beginning of the constellation Orion in the number 2 window. And I had Donn pick that up in the LEB. In the mark procedure utilized in the 50-50 termination, the procedure used when the MARK button wouldn't work. The PMP called - correction, the command module pilot made the mark at the shaft and trunnion angle - CMP timed the shaft and trunnion angles while the spacecraft was in tight DEADBAND, SPS limit cycle ON. The angles were read off by the CDR, and recorded by the LMP. The CMP then proceeded to the next position to record the shaft and trunnion angle, and the LMP called them out, and the CMP inserted them.
In this procedure, two stars were used for the first track in program 53. They were Rigel and Aldebaran, and the star angle difference was 00039. In program 54, the same two stars were used and relative holding, and the star angle difference was 00018. The gyro-torquing angle after this program 54 was 0002 on all four axes, less than 0.025 - less than 0.03.
This task worked out to be satisfactory so that we could have used it for any type of burn if necessary.
The - it was completed. We picked up Hawaii acquisition, and the call was made to get ready for the rendezvous radar transponder test.
And this was rushing us much too fast. We didn't have but 24 minutes' lead time roughly to heat the transponder up to operating temperature.
We used about 1 degree per second in pitch, using ACCEL COMMAND to attempt to get into the desired attitude for the transponder test.
This at least did help us, if the transponder test had failed to get into an ideal attitude for a Gulf Coast pass for the television.
The television camera results I assure - I'm sure, spoke for themselves.
It is necessary to observe, however, that this is compounding a rather difficult test.
In retrospect, my decision not to use the television camera prior to the first SPS burn wan sound. We had too much to do to get the television camera ready. There was too much attention paid to the results of the television camera rather than anything else, as wan typical in this pass.
I believe that television should be left as the last low-priority test objective in relation to any other event that may occur simultaneously.
Typically, with a television camera on board, the crew reacted to it, and we fortunately had no problems occur, but we were paying much too much attention to the TV camera and not to the spacecraft. This is why I object to the TV camera in the first place.
A candid-camera syndrome is a very awkward one to have in a spacecraft.
And this is the end of a...
ARIA 2; AOS in about 5 DB.
This is the command module pilot. Time is 72 hours 50 minutes. I'd like to register a coment or two concerning the optics.
In general, the optics drive is very smooth and much better than we've seen on any of the simulators. The visibility, however, in the telescope is no better, in fact, a little worse than what we experienced in the CMS at the Cape. It was most disappointing to find that you really do have to bury your eye in that thing for a good 5 to 10 minutes...
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
Roger. You are loud and clear, Jack.
You are loud and clear, Wally. We have a procedure for troubleshooting that loss of the voice and telemetry subearrier that we had. Are you ready to go?
I'll take it down.
Okay. We are just going to walk you through it. Walt, we would like you to switch the S-band transponder switch to PRIMARY, pausing in OFF as you go through from SECONDARY to OFF to PRIMARY.
Jack, I'll slide over to the right seat, and I will follow you up again.
Okay. We would like to switch the primary S-band transponder switch into OFF, pausing a bit, and then to PRIMARY.
S-band...
S-band transponder.
Okay. Going into PRIMARY, then OFF, then back to PRIMARY.
Okay. We got it.
Is that it?
Okay. Now we are going to wait a bit and look at some data here.
Roger. Do I have time to blow my nose?
Go ahead.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead.
Roger. Do you have a click, click, click in your receiver?
Negative. Negative, Wally.
Okay. Confirm that the digital pilot goes click, click, click, click, click.
Roger. Stand by.
Whatever that was, it stopped it.
Roger.
It must have been something wrong with Carnarvon's receiver - transmitter.
Keep checking on it.
Roger.
Okay. Jack, I think Carnarvon probably had to switch transmitters down there.
Okay. Stand by, Wally.
Roger.
Carnarvon, this is Wally Schirra. Nice to pass overhead again and good luck.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go, Jack.
Roger. On the results of this transponder shift that we've gone through: we've got our voice and telemetry subcarrier back. We are GO on the primary transponder. The problem was in the secondary transponder so we are GO the way we are.
Very good. I'll leave it this way.
Wally,do you still have the clicking in the receiver?
That is why I was complimenting Carnarvon. They got on it right away and clicked it off.
Okay. Real fine.
They were paying attention to us and did a very good job.
Roger.
Jack, I would say the team worked harder today than they did yesterday.
Say again, Wally.
I say the team worked harder today than they did yesterday.
You bet your life.
Good show.
Apollo 7, Houston. You want to turn up your S-band volume? We are just about to lose you over Carnarvon here.
Roger.
And, 7, looks like that right now we observe the primary evaporator to have dried out again.
It figures. A direct hit.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're 1 minute LOS Honeysuckle; Hawaii in 15 minutes.
without a well-defined pattern, it's pretty hard to find anything by itself.
This is the command module pilot at 72 hours and 50 minutes into the flight of Apollo 7. I'd like to register a comment or two concerning the G&N optics. First, the optics seems to drive very smoothly, and it's very easy to control in both RESOLVED and DIRECT at all speeds for landmark-tracking purposes or star marking or whatever. It's much smoother than we've seen on any simulator. The part that's disappointing, however, is the extremely poor visibility in the telescope. It's no better, in fact, a little worse than what we saw in the CMS, and you really have to bury your eyes in the thing for about 5 to 10 minutes to get dark adapted before you can recognize anything. In general, if you have bright stars in a well-defined, well-known pattern you can find them. We have had a fair amount of luck with the pick-a-pair routine. It appears that as long as we're looking at all sky and not much Earth in the field of view, the thing will work pretty well, so that's a help for doing P52. The tough part, of course, is doing 51's when you're coming up from scratch.
The field of view in the telescope ends at about 38 degrees trunnion. The field of view in the sextant, however, goes out beyond 50 degrees, which is a very curious thing, and we had not expected that. So, effectively, the field, the 20 - the 38-degree alarm that often comes up in the various programs is a real constraint as far as the use of the telescope.
This is CDR, we tried to...
From the glycol evaporator, we tried to salvage the water flow, and it did not take. Procedurally, we went from STEAM PRESSURE, AUTO to MANUAL; worked in the INCREASE position for 45 seconds; waited over 5 minutes for steam pressure to increase - no sign of increase - flowed water with the H2O FLOW switch ON for 2 minutes - no sign of increase in steam pressure - terminated attempt at that point to bring water boiler on the line.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Five-by.
Aloha. We would like to ask you whether you were able to accomplish the switching.
Jack, I have the tape recorder being rewound now. I'll give you a call when we're through rewinding; we'll be ready for dump. We did a P52 alignment in the last night pass; used Diphda and Aldebaran and got five balls, and the star angle difference should he on the tape.
Roger. Copy.
I mean the torquing angle should be on the tape.
Okay. Copy that. Walt, we would like to ask you whether you were able to accomplish the switching operation.
Do you read, Jack?
Apollo 7, do you read? Houston.
Apollo 7, do youread? Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Hello, Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, do you read? Houston.
Apollo 7, how do you read? Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Walt, we copied your transmission on P52. We would like to know whether you were able to accomplish the switching operation for the WSMR rendezvous radar test during the TV operation.
I had the heater on for only about 2 minutes. We had not counted on performing that, and the whole sequence idea was a bit too rushed. We probably should not even attempted it, Jack. However, we did turn the heater on for a couple of minutes, turned it to POWER; we read out the test meter readouts, and I don't know if we passed them down, but we got them logged on board here. The lockon - the signal strength never came up above about 1.4 volts, I think it was.
Okay. We copy that.
Did you have any results from WSMR?
Negative. There is no results from WSMR.
Okay. And since we're up pretty well on fuel now, we'd like to try again on the second callout.
Wally, it looks like we're gonna have a chance about - we may have a chance about 30 minutes after the burn to get - to try again over WSMR.
Okay. And that might be pretty good. We'll have a burning attitude and can psych out on that one.
Right.
We'll stay in burn attitmie and listen to S-band.
Okay.
Okay. Wally, I wanted to ask you a question. Did you have a problem with your BIOMED harness one time?
Yes, I did. Aren't you reading me now?
We're reading.
You're reading center now, aren't you?
Yes, we're reading center now. You want to go to LMP?
Okay. We have switched to LMP. You want LMP; center is LMP.
Okay. Real fine.
Just to give you a cable connection: the CDR is in the right seat, LMP is in the center seat, and CMP is in the left seat.
That is per flight plan burn 3.
Roger. We copy that.
Roger.
Jack, do you have enough time this pass for me to start a tape dump? It's rewound.
Negative, Walt. We'll hit you over the States for the tape dump.
Okay. Are you people in a position to command those tape dumps?
Affirmative.
Huntsville AOS. A two-way lock.
Huntsville LOS.
Huntsville AOS, and downlink signal is very weak. Downlink signal very weak.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Houston.
Roger. Wally, at your leisure, we'd like to get some command module RCS temperature readouts.
Okay. Stand by. We'll be coming.
Roger.
Roger. Jack, 5C reads 5 volts full scale. 5D is 5 volts full scale. 6A is 4.9. 6B is 5.0. 6C is 4.8. 6D is 4.9 volts.
Real fine. We have some - due to this transponder problem, we'd like to reconfigure some switches there, and then we will be back in the normal configuration for our COMM switches. Could we get you to put your power PMP switch to NORMAL?
PMP is set.
Okay. Okay. Your forward rewind switch to FORWARD.
Forward rewind switch to FORWARD.
Your record play swatch to RECORD.
RECORD.
Your telemetry input switch to LOW.
It's there; verifying.
Okay. Real fine. We're now back in normal configuration.
Okay. You asked about my BIOMED. I checked, and the lead was apart again.
Okay. Real fine.
It's too short. Thay've mustt have changed the thing since I tried it last. It was all right during flight preparations.
Jack, I still have the tape switch OFF. Do you want the tape switch ON?
Okay. We want the switches just like you've got them.
Okay. The tape is OFF, and the tape is rewound. No motion. Standing by for your dmnp. Could you summarize what you found wrong with the COMM system? Also, we should tell you that we could not get the glycol evaporator back on the line.
Roger. We copy that.
Okay. Apollo 7, did you try and reservice the primary evaporator?
That's affirm.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. To summarize our findings on the COMM system: we have found that the secondary transponder has failed. We have normal operation on the primary transponder, and except for the secondary problem, our COMM system is operating normally.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Wally, on that BIOMED harness - that problem that you reported. Do you think you'll have time to do any repair work on it?
Afraid not.
The next time you are reading me, if you aren't getting it, ask and I can plug it back in. It seems to pull out when we exercise or during a sleep period.
Okay. We copy.
It's no problem to hook it up.
One of the sensors is leaking. You better leave it out or pull it off.
Canary LOS.
Houston, this is CDR. Let me give you a check on this. I got a light; check my lead. Houston, did you receive?
Stand by, Wally.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're reading LMP data in the center seat.
Roger. We switched it over, and now it's over in the right seat.
Okay. We copy the switch.
Okay. We're getting good data.
We're getting that radio station interterence again.
Okay.
Apollo 7, opposite omni.
Our magazine, O for Oboe.
Roger. Copy.
Five, six, seven, and eight. Starting with Crestview - Pensacola area, Tallahasee, Jacksonville, St. John's river outlet to the Atlantic.
Okay. We copy magazine Oboe six, seven, and eight.
Roger. That was five, six, seven, and eight.
Copy.
Roger. Five, six, seven, and eight.
Hey, Jack, we need a map update.
Okay. Coming up.
Thank you.
By the way, these five windows, almost every darn one of them is looking at something.
I didn't copy that, Wally. Could you say again?
Roger. These five windows have a view almost all the time, except the center hatch window is useless for anything now,
Roger. Copy.
That would be a beautiful window to have working.
Roger. We agree.
Okay. Apollo 7, I have your map update.
Roger. Co ahead.
Okay. For REV 46, the GET of the node is 72 plus 57 plus 26. Longitude 178.7 degrees east, riht ascension 05 plus 28.
Thank you.
Jack, am frames 58 and 59, Bermuda.
Say again, Apollo 7.
Frames 58 and 59 magazine Oboe, we're on Bermuda loud and clear.
Roger.
Complete stratus just north of us for an awful long distance.
The Western Atlantic is pretty well clouded over.
Okay. We copy that.
I would say about 40 miles east of Bermuda, there's a long frontal line. It's running on a line about north and south. The tops are rather difficult to estimate. That's about all I can see at this time.
Okay. Copy.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're 1 minute LOS Bermuda; Antiguas not up now, so we'll pick you up over Ascension in about 10 minutes.
Roger. Thanks Bermuda for staying up for us; will be glad to take their picture. Ready to take a picture.
Apollo 7, Houston. It appears we got 85 degrees yaw. Do you concur?
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Apollo 7, Houston. Hov do you read?
Houston, read you loud and clear. How we?
You're five-by. We copied coarse align.
Apollo 7. We are realigning.
Okay. You're going to need to do P51 and 52 again. You go through P51 and then P40 and then P52. As a reminder, it will not be necessary to go to P30; however, if you do, you will have to reload the targets.
Did you copy that, 7?
Apollo 7, Houston.
Say again.
Roger. Could you copy my message about the programs?
Say again, Jack.
Okay. You'll go through 51 then 40 and then P52. As a reminder, it won't be necessary to go to program 30; if you do, you will have to reload the target.
Understand.
Okay. Real fine. One question on the primary evaporator: did you - did the steam pressure come up to NORMAL? After the serve - reservice?
Jack, the steam pressure did not move one iota.
OKay. Copy that.
Apollo 7. Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Would you go INCREASE for 45 seconds on your steam pressure control valve switch?
Roger. We'll try it again.
Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS Ascension; we'll pick you up over Tananarive in about 18 minutes. We'd like to watch our reservice over Cansrvon.
Roger. Understand. No response on EVAP pressure valve.
Roger. We copy that.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Okay. Houston, do you read. me now?
I read you five-by, Wally.
Roger.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Forty-five seconds LOS Tananarive; we will pick you up over Carnarvon in about 8 minutes.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, read you five-by.
Roger. We just resynchronized our MET of the MPC. It was running 5 seconds slow. The MET of the LEB is right on.
Okay. Copy that. And, Wally, we are standing by to watch your primary evaporator reservice, if you're ready for it.
Jack, as you're reading it, the steam pressure has come up.
Okay. We copy that now; we see it. The other thing is - the burn 3 flight plan activity - is of the SCS attitude reference check, and the SLA stamping - SCS SI& stamping we would just like to remind you of those.
Roger.
Apollo 7, we copied your clock problems. We would like to give you a GET hack at 074 plus 12 plus 30 in about 15 seconds.
Here we've got a 16 65 off the board.
Okay.
The water boiler light is on again.
Copy. I passed that check, due to your water boiler comment. I'll give it to you at 074 plus 13 plus 00.
We can take it any time.
13 is good.
Aren't you reading out DSKY?
Yes, we have a delay here, Wally. There's - four, three, two, one.
MARK.
074 plus 13 plus 00. We're reading the DSKY, but we have a delay down here so we're not quite accurate.
After the simulation, we're 7/100 of a second off.
Okay. Copy.
Okay. Jack, when you gave yours, I had 59 and 93.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Do you have any thoughts on why the evaporator didn't reservice the time before this?
We gave it 5 minutes. This time, we gave it a little bit longer. That may be the variable.
Okay. Copy.
If it was it happened between this one and the one you did; that may not be the answer.
Jack, it came back spontaneously like it did once earlier in the flight.
Roger. We copy that.
The EVAP pressure valve - or water control valve is frozen closed or something?
It more or less comes back on its own.
Okay. We copy.
When I see it coming back, I generally help it along by throwing a little water on it.
Walt, or Wally, do you think it might be a sticky solenoid in the water control valve?
Could be; it's that kind of a trouble.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Carnarvon; Hawaii in 18 minutes.
That's what we've got here.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Roger. Loud and clear.
You are loud and clear. We would like to pass up this WSMR rendezvous radar test data now - before we get all tied up with burn procedures.
Okay. We were just thinking about that ourselves. That's pretty close ESP.
Okay. Let me know when you are reade to copy.
Go ahead.
Okay. Your roll attitude will be 349.3, pitch 305.8, yav 061. Your GET AOS will be 76 plus 23. Estimated GET rendezvous radar lock 76 plus 25. There is a remark: the rendezvous transponder heater ON at 76 plus 00.
Roger. Understand. Attitude 349.3, 305.8, 061.0, AOS at 76 plus 23, lockon at 76 plus 25, heater ON at 76 plus 00.
Roger. That yaw attitude would be better at 060.8.
We will get it pretty close to 060, Jack.
Okay.
Roger.
Do you people have any druthers for S-band antenas covering this burn?
Okay. Stand by. We'll get it to you.
Jack, on this slosh test - that's all the more reason to ge to four jets. I want you to read the procedure during the burn.
Roger. Wally, we copy.
Okay. I'm going down into attitude now.
Hey, Jack, is the S-IVB still up?
Affirmative.
I don't know if we ever reported to you, but Wally and I observed it visually when it was about 400 miles behind us. What's its relative position now?
Okay. Stand by. We will give it to you exactly.
Within a mile or two would he good enough.
Apollo 7, the S-IVB appears to be about 700 and some odd miles ahead of you.
Roger.
Huntsville AOS.
Huntsville. Two-way lock, solid range.
Houston, Apollo 7. Over.
Go ahead.
I think we are passing over Baja California again. I took frames on magazine O: frames 55 and 56 Hawaiian Islands; 57 and 58 were Baja California, Gulf of California.
Roger. Copy that, Walt.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go, Houston.
Roger. We would like for you to turn your O2 fan 1 to ON for 3 minutes here.
Hey, Jack, every several hours, I've been switching funs like this.
Okay. Copy that.
Walt, when was the last time you did it on tank 1?
On tank 1 - oh, maybe an hour and a half ago.
Okay. We would like you to do it again here if you would.
Done.
Jack, I gave you the wrong frame numbers a while ago. I just uncovered 65, and it looks like about 58 and 59 with the Hawaiian Islands and 60, 61, 62 coming across the Gulf Coast of Mexico.
Okay. Copy.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead.
Did you get the fuel usage on that backup alignment technique?
I'll see if I can get some figures on that for you to pass up.
Okay. The fuel we had before we tried the alignment up here the fuel we had when we came across the States on the TV pass.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. You can turn O2 tank 1 fan off.
Tank 1 fan is OFF. Is it your wish, Bill, only to have one running at a time so I never lose two buses, or do you intend to keep them both off and put them on for the DSKY once in a while?
Okay. Walt, what we're going to do - that's what we have been doing - is having only one fan on at a time. What we are goin to do over Ascension here, we want you to turn the fans in tank 2 off, and then you'll have them both OFF; and after the burn, we'll turn the number 2 fan bank on.
Okay. I got both of them OFF now. You want number 2 back. ON?
Roger. Turn number 2 on right now; we'll turn it off at Ascension.
Roger. It's on. I just took frames 63 and 64 of magazine O.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Go.
Roger. On that question about the RCS fuel usage: for the period across the States and including the backup alignment, we - about all we can accurately predict is about 5 pounds of RCS fuel uSage.
You had to predict, Jack? You couldn't measure that, huh?.
This...
Again, we would like to have an update to our onboard charts now if you have it, and then one after the burn, please.
Okay. Coping up.
Jack,while you're at it, I'd like to have you consider eliminating the chlorination of our water today. It took just about - oh, about 3 before it started tasting palatable again.
Okay. Copy.
And we'll put chlorine in tomorrow.
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 7, are you in AUTO in the primary evaporator steam pressure?
That's affirmative, and I see thank you very much.
Okay.
This time I'm not going to try to increase it; I'm going to try to just turn the water on.
Okay, Apollo 7. We don't want you to do that.
Okay.
Must be dried out.
Okay. Stand by one.
Okay. I'm following malfunction procedures again; I'll attempt to increase it.
Okay. We concur on it.
It seems to be coming up.
Roger. We copy.
And, Walt, we suggest that you leave the back pressure valve closed until after the burn, and then we'll think it out. We'll have the answer to Wally's chlorination question after the burn, also.
Last night, we had some pretty bad water; it was pretty disappointing.
Okay. Copy.
I couldn't eat the last part of my last meal yesterday 'cause I didn't want to put that water in it.
Roger.
A lift-off agreement was that if it tasted bad, we'd stop; we're just proposing to knock off 1 day.
Okay. We copy.
Roger.
Houston, I've been able to get this up to a normal range so I suspect that with a little manipulation of the water flow, I can get this boiler operating again. That's the way I did it once before.
Roger. Copy. And, Walt, the figure to update your onboard RCS chart is 800 poundS, 800.
Understand. 800 now and will be standing by for one after the burn. And what does quad C have now?
Stand by.
We will pick you up over Ascension in about 6 minutes, Walt.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 7, Houston.
Hello, Apollo 7, Houston.
Hello, Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Loud and clear here.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Hello, Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger. You're now coming in loud and clear. I'll again remind you on the star check that the sextant stars are not visible after 75 plus 35.
Roger. We're set up now.
And I just wanted to recheck on what the stars look like. And also, Jack will talk to you now on the CRYO's.
Okay. We think we had a star check in daylight, but we're not sure.
Okay.
The approximate attitude and - I looked for the star, and it came in with AUTO optics. I'm pretty sure it was lined up, and I'm pretty sure I was looking at the right star in the daytime using a sextant only.
Okay. Real good.
Okay...
Get that? Sextant only.
And, Walt, the question you asked on quad C fuel: the readout is 177 pounds. Your omni antenna for the burn will be omny B Baker, and we would like you to turn the O2 fans in tank 2 to Off.
Tank 2 is OFF. 177, I assume that's quad C?
Quad C, Charlie.
Roger. And I've got an antenna B for the burn.

That's what we like to hear. That's good news.
Yes, that saves a lot of fuel.
Apollo 7, Houston through Guam.
Roger. We're standing in attitude now.
Roger. That was a real good burn, Wally. We confirmed your orbit on radar, 90 by 160.
Roger.
And we would like to have you turn your O2 fans tank 2 to AUTO.
Done.
Okay. And O2 fuel tank 1 to OFF, and remain in this configuration until ground cue.
Roger. Standing by.
Okay. After the WSMR radar test which is coming up, we will be ready to power down and set up housekeeping.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Guam; we pick you up at Hawaii in about 8 minutes.
Roger. We have our transponder heater on. We are working into attitude.
We couldn't copy that, Wally. Say again.
Roger. We have the transponder heater on; we are working into attitude.
Okay. Real fine. Real fine.

Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. Standing by.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Roger.
You're five-by, Wally. We had a real good look, close look at the SPS data, and it was right down the line. Real good operation.
Roger. Sounds like I got a good engine.
It sure does.
Apollo 7, Nouston. Opposite omni.
Apollo 7, Houston. Roger.
Okay. Wally, on your question on the chlorination: you may delete the chlorination for today. We'll ask you for some later data on the taste of your water as we go along.
Roger. I gotta agree with you. Very good.
Huntsville AOS.
Jack.
All right. Go ahead, Wally.
If there's a power down, I'd like to leave one of the blue bags there to check our speedup rate during drifting flight.
I'd like to start drifting flight with our rate almost to zero, and then we'll see how they develop.
Roger. We concur.
We heard a report last night that Lunney said it looked like we were very stable, but that turned out not to be true.
Which one do you plan to leave on, Wally?
DSKY lifters, we could get a check on this control board, we're another 2 deadband rate high, SCS attitude hold.
Roger. We copy.
Roger.
Got to prepare that square for the GTO.
Apollo 7, Houston. We should be getting the estimated radar lockon at this time.
Roger. We're still reading zero.
Roger. Still reading zero on the meter.
Roger.
Tune it just a little bit. It's coming up a little bit now.
Roger. Understand. The meter is coming up.
Roger. Came up about.1. It came up 1 volt.
Roger. One volt.
Good deal, terrific. Then it want down to zero. Yes, 'cause that is about 1.4 volts.
Roger.
It's solid on 1.5. Right at 1.5 volts.
Roger. Understand. Solid at 15.
Roger. That's good news. Set on 1.7.
Set on 1.7 there.
Roger.
1.7, almost 1.8.
1.7.
It's dropping off now; I think we're making lock.
Roger.
She came back up - about 1.6.
We're holding lock about 1.4.
decide to use that radar, setup sure a lot better.
Okay. now.
Looks like we beat the Gemini VI, Tom.
Roger.
Still holding lock 1.5. That's pretty spectacular.
Okay. 1.5.
Just dropped off - and she's zero. Tom, I'd say it's a good job. I think it's come to the end of the lock.
Okay. It's back to zero then, Wally?
Affirm.
Okay.
Pretty far down the pike by now.
Yes, you're gonnA be cutting across down around Mexico City shortly.
Si.
Okay. As soon as we find out the data, Wally, we'll call it back to you.
Okay. I'm sure glad to see you got that one.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Tom.
Roger. White Sands said they got locked on solid, had good data; they had you at 450 miles for 50 seconds.
Magnifico! Give them my compliments. You mean they copied itt
Yes, right - radar sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
Great news.
Good show.
Yes.
There's nothing on TV that'll stop me from O making the big trip.
(Laughter)
Some kind of small success there.
Yes, the DTO's are looking pretty good.
Roger.
They sure looked good on that SCS burn, too; that looked tight as the dickens.
It looked better to me than the G&N.
Yes.
It was as good, at least.
Roger. We have yaw 70 degrees at this time.
We're going to PAD down shortly so we won't worry about Saturday night.
Roger. I'll give your regards to MIT.
Say again?
We'll drop another gimbal on me.
Give them mine, 'too.
Okay.
Tom, we're planning to power down here; does that jive with your revised?
That's right; we're going to power down shortly.
Okay. We'll leave the B bag up.
Okay.
Tom, we'd like to go ahead and power down to G&N.
Say again?
power down to G&N now.
Okay. We're ready. You can go ahead and power it down.

Houston, Apollo 7. Did you call me? Over.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Your waste quantity is now about 77 percent, and you have a GO to dump at your convenience.
Roger. We will probably wait until it's closer to 90, Ron.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Tananarive standing by.
Roger, Tananarive.
Roger.
Good afternoon, Ron.
Yes, watched the tail end of your burn there, it looked real good.
You ought to feel it!
Apollo 7, Houston. About 1 minute LOS; we'll have your block data at Hawaii.
Roger, Ron, we'll copy them.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Loud and clear, Ron.
Roger. I have your block data in number 9 to give you.
Ready to copy.

Apollo 7, Houston. Your readback correct.
Roger, Ron.
Apollo 7, Houston. Let's check the one on fifty-first rev. The DELTA-V should be 34 20.
On 51 3 Bravo.
Roger. On area 051 3 Bravo.
342 Bravo, 34 20. Roger.
Roger. Just about LOS. We would like to start battery B charging over Hawaii after we pick up data.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Roger.
Roger. We have data; you can commence batt B charge any time.
Roger. Commencing now. Is there anything in particular you're observing there for starting this charge?
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. We just want to look at the voltage and the current. We would also like to get your onboard reading of the current when you start it up.
Roger. It's kind of interesting. The charger is showing DC amps zero.
That is interesting.
Not what you expected, is it?
Not quite.
Now that I'm on battery B, it's showing 2.2 amps. Do you read 2.2 amps?
I don't want a keyhole now, Walt. I can't compare it.
Say again.
I don't want a keyhole over Hawaii; we can't compare it. We'll pick up data here shortly.
Okay. On 37 volts, 2.25 amps.
Roger.
Walt, we're showing the 2.18 amps now and 37.4 volts.
Huntsville, two-wheel log, valid range.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston. About 1 minute to LOS.
Roger. We real production now on interior photography.
Roger.
We're trying to show just how mobile you can be inside of this thing.
Very good. Walt, for your information there, the cutoff on that charge will be.4 amp or ampere hours replaced.
Roger. Understand. Sounds like try to get to 4.4 amps first, or by bart A, right?
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Tananarive standing by.
Apollo 7. Roger. We just finished with the housekeeping.
Like sponging up a pint of water aft - off the aft bulkhead.
Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read?
Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read?
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS.
This is Apollo 7. Do you read now?
Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read?
Houston, Apollo 7.
78 hours and 10 minutes into the flight, we noticed a puddle of water that was formed between the suit stowage bag and the aft bulkhead. There was probably approximately 1 pint of fluid, which we identified as water. And by tracking around the spacecraft, we located the source as coolant line in - at the - below the commander's left shoulder in the curved panel at the corner, which has the perforated holes in it. We removed the panel with tool E and located the condensation on the line behind the panel. Apparently, this water settled to the aft bulkhead, probably during the last SPS burn, and it would probably be advisable for us to check that periodically and make sure we're not collecting any more condensed water.
Apollo 7, Houston, Mercury.
Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read?
Houston, Apollo 7. Over.
Apollo 7, Houston. Roger. We read you, and we request your battery charger current.
Okay. That can wait. We had a minor problem when we left you awhile ago. We could hear you call us over Tananarive, but we couldn't raise you. The SPS burn left a large puddle of water on the aft bulkhead. At first, we were very concerned about whether it was water glycol or water. We tasted it; it was water. We checked further and discovered it was underneath the suit bags. Since that time, we mopped it using the waterhose dump system. The water came from the coolant lines that we used to use and the water coolant lines and its condensation. We took a panel off - the small perforators panel - to determine how to work the problem. Houston, Apollo.
Roger. We copied part of that, I think, Wally. Looks like you've got water on your aft bulkhead, and it came from the water coolant line. I'm not sure of your condition at the present time - if it's still coming in or not.
we have it all mopped up. It's condensate water, we're positive. It will probably occur again. We have given a full story on the tape for the dump.
Roger.
Roger. I understand it's all on the voice tape for the dump, also.
Right. And the battery charge occurred. I'm showing about.6 amps. Looked to me like it jumped up real fast here and then takes a long time on the plateau.
Roger. We concur. We're reading.55 now, Walt.
Okay. I'll have to expect you keep me posted because I never got below.5 last time, and you got down to about.41.
Roger. We understand. We're estimating about 10 hours to get down to.41.
Okay. Why don't you and the rest of the gang have a drink for us to celebrate Donn and my fifth annuversary in the program today.
Hey, great! By golly, will do.
At this rate, I'll be an old man by my second flight.
Walt, we could also use your service module RCS quantity readings, and then we will correct them for you.
Roger. I'll give them to you. We haven't been too concerned with onboard readouts since we're going with your quantities.
Roger.
reading 54. RCS-B is reading - well, the same as it was. RCS-C is reading 60. RCS-D is reading 65. Over.
Roger. Say again Charlie.
Roger. Charlie is reading 60.
Roger. Filty-four, nothing or 93, and 60, and 65.
Roger. We have it. I think we'd be interested in your quantities for each of our quads.
Roger. We'll work it out and send it back.
And I ain't think we ever got a total quantity for our I need A numbers to put on my RCS profile as I carry in my checklist.
Roger. We're working up on all that, and we've a status coming up to you. It'll be coming up a little later.
We thank you. And we have our own estimate of the new service module RCS redline. Interesting to see what you guys come up with.
Roger. Wally, you might like to know that parts of your BIOMED harness has probably become disconnected again. We don't read the heart rate down there.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Opposite omni.
Roger. Walt, we'd like to request O2 tank 1 fans ON for about 5 minute now, then OFF.
Roger. Tank 1 fans ON.
If you get a chance, look down on the ground there. You might be able to see a big fire.
Where at?
I think you my not see it till the next pass; it's over in Hawaii.
Roger.
You say that big fire is to the west?
Yes. That's affirmative. We'll try to give you some pointing data for the next pass over.
Roger. Thank you.
Huntsville two-way lock. Downlink weak, too weak for valid range.
Huntsville two-way lock; valid range.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Houston. Go.
Roger. We also just discovered water coming out of our blue hoses, at least the one in the center couch. I haven't checked the other two yet, but we've got quite a bit of visible moisture flowing out of it.
Roger. Coming out of the blue O2 hose. Is that what you said?
Affirmative. And we've temporarily turned off the suit compressor so we could clean up - clean it up.
Roger.
The anomaly is going to be a problem here, but I can see the solution to the problum.
Roger.
Huntsville LOS.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Roger. We read you five-by, Ron.
Roger. We sure could use your battery manifold pressure, systems test 4A.
We read the temperature about a half an hour ago when we used it to dump something, and it reads 1.4 until you open the vent and when you open the vent, it reads about.5.
Roger.
Did you read? Did you read that, Ron?
Apollo 7, Houston. Roger. Read 1.4 and 0.5 when you opened the vent.
Roger. And we checked our lithium hydroxide canisters. They are dry. We have checked the suit circuit water and it's functioning in AUTO 1 and AUTO 2. It's remaining in AUTO 2.
Roger. Have you come to any specific point in the malfunction procedures?
Not yet.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go.
Roger. Looks like our battery charging current is decreasing a little faster then predicted, and we would like your onboard reading.
Roger. I am reading.5 amps.
Roger..5. We will keep you advised on it.
Walt, that volcano should he about 30 degrees down and 20 degrees left of local vertical at 80 plus 57.
Eighty plus 57 amd 30 degrees down and 20 degrees left.
Roger.
What?
Roger. Thirty degrees left, 20 down, and 30 left. No, belay that. Thirty degrees down and 20 left of local vortical.
Thirty down and 20 left at 80 hours and 57 minutes.
Affirmative.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS; Mercury at 35.
Roger. Mercury 35.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger. I have flight plan update for you. One line.
Go ahead.
Roger. Eighty-two plus 00; fuel cell oxygen purge.
Roger. We read you, Ron.
Roger.
that volcano, was that at 80:57?
Roger. Volcano time 80 plus 57.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Based on the trend, it looks like we'll terminate batt B charge, probably over Hawaii.
Roger.
We are still getting water out of our three hoses.
Roger. I understand.
Wally, is there any way you can maybe give us an estimate of how much water is coming out there?
Ron, the first time we hacked out of there, about a spoonful from the center one, and we were getting about - that's a teaspoonful - we're getting about half of that out of the left one, and just a little moisture out of the right one.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 7, Houston. While we're at it, any astimate on the quantity that was on the bulkhead?
About a pint. Quite a large amount.
Yes, I'd say so.
Apollo 7, Houston. Request BIOMED to position 3.
Roger.
Thirty seconds LOS; Hawaii at 53.
Hawaii 53. What islands are we gotng by?
Roger. Be going south of the big islands.
Roger.
Donn, turn those down, will you?
CMP, 20 clicks of water; LMP, 11 clicks of water.
Apollo 7, Houston, Hawaii via S-band.
Apollo 7, Houston. Hawaii M and O VHF for a bit.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger.
Roger. S-band volume up.
Roger. On S-band.
Roger. Hawaii M and 0 VHF OFF now.
We're stauding by this pass.
Apollo 7, Houston. I recommend terminate battery charging on B.
Roger. Terminate. I'd like to get a report from you on how much we have in B, if you get a chance - and also on A.
Wilco.
Roger. Ron, we got a good sweep down the entire chain. The big island itself is pretty well clobered with clouds, and you don't actually see Kilauea.
Roger. That's a heck of a note.
It's the clearest we've ever seen it out here over Hawaii, though. We've got very nice pictures of the entire chain. We took some movies, but we don't know how good they are.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS; Mercury at 82 plus 10.
Roger. Mercury at 82 plus 10.
Houston, this is Apollo 7.
Go.
Houston CapCom, Apollo 7.
Say again.
Go.
Apollo 7, Houston. Did you call?
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury.
Roger. Ron, read you loud and clear. How me?
Roger. Loud and clear.
When we left Hawaii...
I ended up with a failed switch in the number 2 handcontroller in pitch down. We discovered it in acceleration command. I will troubleshoot it when we get the computer back on the line after we power up.
Roger. A lot of static, Wally; say again.
Okay. Over Hawaii, just as we went by the big Island, the number 2 handcontroller failed in the pitch-down direction in ACCEL COMMAND and pulsed.
Roger. Copy.
I only got one pulse in pitch down, but I got continual pitch-down command and ACCEL COMMAND. I'd like to try to troubleshoot that. We'll try it in RATE COMMAND. I will troubleshoot that in the computer bulb when we power up.
Roger.
Say, Ron, do you have time to give us a map update?
Roger. Stand by. I'll get you one.
Okay. And have the doctors done any talking down there about the possibility of one or all of us having a cold and stopped up ears on reentry?
Roger. They've been thinking about it, and they will advise.
Okay. We've got something on board here in a medical kit called antibiotic. I was wondering if we ought to be taking it, or what? So far, Wally's, I guess, about holding his own on his ears. Donn may be getting a little bit worse, and I think my ears are still clearing up fairly well.
Roger. I think before antibiotics, they're concerned about temperature. Do you have a temperature? You know, before you go into the antibiotics.
We'll start wearing the oral thermometer a little bit and see where we stand, just for the experience.
Roger.
7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We'd like you to proceed with the waste water dump.
Roger.
We're reading 80 percent. What do you show?
Roger. We read 82.9.
Roger. We'll dap just after we LOS.
Roger. And any further water problems out of the hoses there, or any results of the humidity survey?
We haven't had any more water coming out the hoses for about the last 40 minutes. The humidity survey indicates that water is going to condense out.
Roger.
We'll give you the readings om the last run if we can go.
Roger. Our last humidity reading. Are you ready to copy?
Affirmative.
At Wally's suit inlet hose, I'll give you wet then dry, 54/66. The inlet to the cabin heat exchauger 58/68. At the condensate pipe, we had a temperature on the pipe of 52. The wet bulb in the area was 58. The dry bulb in the area was 73. Over by the right-hand window, we had a 68/72. Over.
Roger. We copy.
7, I have your map update.
Go.
REV 52, GET node 81 plus 52 plus 02, longitude 42.4 east, right ascension 05 plus 19.
Roger.
CDR, one Actifed, two aspirins at 81 hours and 15 minutes; LMP, one Actifed.
CDR, one Actifed; 82:23.
Correction, that's Lomotil at 82:23.
Apollo 7, Houston. Hawaii standing by.
This is Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. You're real weak.
Roger. Read you loud and clear.
Roger.
adjust our sleep cycle here. This 5½ hours is not too appealing with burn 3 already out of the way.
Roger.
We would like to add an hour and a half to each of our sleep cycles.
Go. May I copy that, Wally?
Okay. That will give us each 7 hours. So we'll stay on watch for an hour and a half here and sack it out with Donn tomorrow or later.
Okay.
Very good. What we'll do is just add an hour and a half to each of our sleep schedules.
So far it looks good down here.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone.
Roger, Ron.
Roger.
We're standing by for an RCS quantity update.
Roger. We had it just about all fixed, and then you guys used some over Hawaii. We're working on it.
Sorry about that.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Apollo 7,...
update tomorrow afternoon sometime.
Say again, Walt.
Why don't you see if Jack can pass us up a Lima Sierra update tomorrow afternoon sometime.
Wilco.
Ron, it's completely dry underneath the suit bag at this time.
Roger. That's good to hear that. I was a little curious how it stayed in one place down there.
I massed that. Ascension at 08.
stuck in there by adhesive.
Roger. I understand.
stuck between the two.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger. I have some data for you if you are ready to copy.
Go ahead.
Roger. Your total usable service module RCS fuel is quad A 48 percent, Bravo 57 percent, Charlie 48 percent, and Delta 57 percent.
What does that all total up to in pounds, Ron? Do you have that?
Roger. For your chart update, it's 687 pounds at 83 hours. I have your new redlines if you'd like those also.
Forty-eight percent usable - that's a number I have - I'm not sure that is - how much do I have in that quad that's usable?
Walt, say again.
We also have to switch at 43 percent, and I don't think it's 43 percent usable. It's 43 percent...
Apollo 7, Houston. Are you saying when to switch to secondaries?
Negative.
We switched to secondaries at 43 percent, and I need to know an absolute percent in the quad - not a percent usable - if you have that number.
Roger. We'll get it for you.
And the number for the chart you said was 683?
687.
687. Thank you.
And I have your battery totals.
Go ahead with the battery.
Roger. Batt A 33.2, batt B 30.8, batt C 39.5.
Roger. You're getting low, low there. I hope you are still considering a different chart sometime, around six or so.
Roger. Walt, we're still evaluating this. We're working very closely with the manufacturer, and we should have some information probably sometime tomorrow.
Roger. Thank you, Ron.
And be adwised the voice quality of the DSE is still good.
Roger. Understand. Thank you. Were you giving me usable or a number to go on my chart when you gave me the chart update?
The chart update is what you go on the chart with on the poundage. The percentage was the total usable, as calculated on the ground, not a correction factor for your gages.
Roger. Our chart includes 58 pounds unusable. Do we add that to the number you gave, or did you give us the number for the oradinate there?
The numnber for the oradinate.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're readng about 84 percent on the waste water to quantity. Just about LOS now.
Roger. We are going to commence dumping in 5 minutes.
Roger. We will pick you up at Mercury at 44.
Say again, Wally.
The last number we had vas 808; looks like I missed 20 pounds less than 4.3.
Roger. I understand.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. Standing by.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. Standing by.
Roger. We read you loud and clear.
Roger. Same here.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute till LOS; Redstone at 15.
Roger. We're just breaking down now, and we'll be changing crews. Wally and I are getting off here.
Roger.
We get off here.
Say again, Walt.
I was just repeating we get off here.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone.
Apollo 7, Redstone. Standing by.
Roger. Ron.
Hey, good morning.
How are you?
Getting along great. Yourself?
Oh, just fine; I just got up. Had a good night's rest. Wally and Walt are sacking out now.
Okay. Good.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go, Ron.
Roger. We want to cycle the O2 tank fans at this time. Turn them on and - - for 5 minutes and then off.
Roger. I've got 1 ON at the moment; 2 OFF. You want me to turn 2 on for a bit?
Negative. We thoutgh O2 tank 1 fan was OFF. We would like to turn on tank 1 fan at this time.
Okay. Well, they're just the other way around.
Okay. Stand by, then.
Okay. Donn, let's go ahead and cycle tank 2 fans ON for 5 minutes and then OFF.
Roger. We've got a couple of reports for you.
Roger. Go.
Roger. We had canister change number 7. at 82:30, and we - Wally and Walt - checked the command module RCS temperatures at around 83 hours, and they were all 5 volts. All except 6A, and that was 4.9.
Roger. Copy.
Ron, we have a number of 687 pounds RCS. Now is that total, or is that just the usable?
Donn,that is usable propellant.
Okay. So I can add - for our chart up here, I can add the 58 pounds that we've got included in it?
That's affirmative. You can.
Roger. In the future, when you give us the totals, would you please have the usable added in because that's what we plotting on this 2 little card we've got.
Roger. You want the ordinate when I give you the update. Is that correct?
Roger.
That makes us feel better. We wondered what happened to all the fuel all of a sudden.
Okay.
Donn, I want to make sure you save three of your decongestants for use prior to reentry.
Roger. We got you on that.
Roger.
I've got about 1 minute to LOS, Donn.
Understand.
You might be interested to know that the little TV yesterday morning was much, much better than any ground testing I had ever seen.
Is that right? Boy, that's great.' Did you see it on the commercial?
That's affirmative, and it was really great.
Outstanding.
Apollo 7, Houston. Ascension standing by.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS; Mercury at 18.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Houston. Apollo 7.
Roger. Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Mercury. I would like to brief yon on a USB test. It involves a couple of switches.
Okay. Co ahead.
Roger. Just about time LOS Mercury, we would like power TMP to AUX and the S-band volume up for that Guam pass; and this will be at about 25 minutes, 85 hours and 25 minutes.
Okay. Will do. You want power TMP to AUX and S-band volume up.
Right. And if the test doesn't work out, I will try and come back on VHF. Otherwise, at LOS Guam, you can put the pover TMP back to NORMAL.
Roger. Understand.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. We would like power TMP to AUX any time now.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go.
Roger. Would you confirm the H2 fUel cell purge that is in the flight plan?
Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston. Negative. We are updating that real time. You can disregard that entry.
Roger. That is what I thought; the heaters are off. I've got a couple of reports I would like to make.
Go.
Okay. When Wally went to sleep, which was about 84 hours, he took two aspirins amd 20 clicks of water; and when I went to sleep about 77 hours, I took two aspirins and an Actifed and 20 clicks of water.
Roger. Understand. Wally at 84 hours: two aspirins and 20 clicks. Donn at 77 hours: two aspirins, one Actifed, and 20 clicks.
That is affirmative.
Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston. I'll have a block data at Redstone.
Roger. Understand. Block data at Redstone.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Guam; Redstone at 50.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 7. Go.
Roger. I have a block data when you are ready to copy.
Go ahead, Bill.
Roger. Before I start, we would like to confirm the TMP power back to NORMAL.
Roger. It is NORMAL.
Okay. Block data, starting to read: 057 dash 2 Alfa plus 242 minus 0270 089 0620 3382, 58 dash 1 Charlie plus 200 minus 0600 090 3041 3332, 059 dash 1 Alfa plus 270 minus 0640 092 0654 3349, 060 dash 1 alta plus 310 minus 0644 093 4329 3409, 061 dash 1 Alfa plus 306 minus 0645 095 2000 3659, 062 dash 1 Alfa plus 254 minus 0640 096 5238 2888. Read back, please.
Roger. 57 dash 2 Alfa plus 242 minus 0270 089 0620 3382, 058 dash 1 Charlie plus 200 minus 0600 090 3041 3332, 059 dash 1 Alfa plus 270 minus 0640 092 0654 3349, 060 dash 1 Alfa plus 310 minus 0644 093 4329 3409, 061 dash 1 Alfa 306 minus 0645 095 2000 3659, 062 dash Alfa plus 254 minus 0640 096 5238 2888.
Readback is correct.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are still showing real time on SM, and would you check TMP power NORMAL again?
Oh. Roger. I got it now.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Redstone. Ascension at 17.
Roger. Houston.
86 hours 13 minutes; a filament failed in the right-hand LEB floodlights.
Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Ascension. Standing by.
Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Ascension. Standing by.
Roger. You're very garbled, Houston.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up on LOS Mercury at 53.
Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Mercury standing by.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Bill, could you get me the static vent update for our orbital map?
Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston. The GET for the nodal crossing is 84 plus 49 plus 48.
Roger. Understand. 84 plus 49 plus 48.
Right. And it will be 3.1 west...
Roger. Tnank you.
and it is REV 54.
Roger.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Guam. I will have a flight plan update at Redstone, and it has several items.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Houston, stand by one. I'll be with you in 1 minute.
Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7. Go.
Roger. Donn, I have a rather extensive flight plan update; and what I'd like for you to do is just follow me with the flight plan, and we'll go through here from about 88 hours right on through up to 100 hours.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Apollo 7, Houston. Just let me know when you're ready to copy.
Roger. Go ahead, Bill. I'm ready.
Donn, do you have the flight plan there?
Roger.
Okay.
Roger. I've got it right in front of me.
Right. Good. Because I didn't want you to have to write it on anything else. At 88 hours, delete the reference to P30.
Roger.
Okay. Now on the next half of the page, from 88 to 90, you can delete everything on that page, and there'll be two additions so you can just draw a line throigh all of those if you want.
Should be what?
We'll delete, cancel all the actions listed from 88 hours to 90 hours.
Right. I got that.
Okay. At 89 hours, there'll be a CMC power up, program 5.
What time?
89 plus 00.
Roger. 89 hours power up?
Boger. At 89 plus 30, you'll get an update for RAD degradation test; that'll be a state vector and time of ignition.
Okay. Are you ready for 90 hours?
Bill, you're cutting in and out. I'm only getting about half of this.
Okay. I'll say again. Did you get those two additions? Did you get the one at...
Negative. All I got was delete everything from 88 through 90 and then power up at 89.
Roger. Okay. At 89 plus 30, there will be an update for radiator degradation.
Just a minute.
Okay. At - are you still reading?
Roger. You want the whole G&N up at that time or just the complrcer?
Well, let's see. Right, that's correct, that's a complete power up at 89 hours.
Okay.
And at 89 plus 30, the update will be for the radiator degradation test. Starting at 90 hours, you can delete everything on that page.
Roger.
And at 90 hours and about 10 minutes, you can put in there P51.
Roger.
At 91 hours and 42 minutes, a P52.
Wait a minute; 91 hours is in the day time.
91 42. Donn, we're getting ready for LOS here. I'll talk to you at Antigua.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Canary.
Apollo 7, Houston. We'd like to continue with the flight plan update when you're ready.
Roger. Go ahead, Bill.
Roger. I think we were talking about 91 hours and 42 minutes, a P52, and you were questioning nighttime; and the nighttime is starting to move back a little bit because of the change in the orbit, and that should be all right just after sunset.
Roger. I didn't get the minutes on that: 91 42 for a P52?
Eoger. That's right: 91 plus 42. Okay. On the second column of page 2-36, starting at 92 hours: at 92 25 23, we have an MCC update. You can scratch through everything except the GO/NO-GO. And at 92 plus 35, add "Initiate radiator degradation test".
Roger. Say again that time for that.
92 plus 35.
Okay. Got it.
Right. You can delete the P30 - all the references to preparation for the burn, of course; you can delete those. At 93 plus 15, add "H2 strat test (percent)" is what they'll estimate you have at that time.
So that will be at 93 plus 15, H2 strat test (60 percent).
Roger. Got it.
And the canister change does stay in.
Okay.
At 94 hours, fuel cell O2 purge.
Okay.
Next page. 94 hours plus 30, unstow and set up TV.
Roger.
And, of course, the - you can delete the items in there about the radiator degradation test and H2 heaters ON at 95 hours.
Okay.
At 95 plus 25, TV ON. That will be at Texas AOS; 95 plus 25, TV ON.
Roger. I got you.
Okay. On the next column, at 96 plus 40, delete the reference to the ECS radiator degradation test.
Roger.
At 97 hours, add "End radiator degradation test". You will have started it up about 92 35.
Okay.
Also, at 97 hours, you'll receive update for scanning telescope star count. That'll be at 97 hours, update SCT star count.
Okay.
And for that, the sun line of sight (LOS) will be 70 degrees.
Roger.
At 97 plus 40, program 52.
Roger. Is that option 3?
Stand by. Be at C align time. At 98 hours, the test - the SCT star count will be performed.
At what time7
98 hours.
98 even?
Affirmative.
I don't understand that. That's right in the midle of the night pass, isn't it?
Roger. And it continues into the day.
that's going to be a little hard to - you going to realign at 97 40 and then do the test at...
Roger. Just on the further edge of LOS. If you read, that is affirmative.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Go.
Roger. Acquisition Redstone. I have one final item here on the flight plan update.
Ready to go.
Roger. At 99 plus 30, we will have a G&N, N and SCS power down.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Redstone; Antigua at 17. And when we come up on Antigua, we would like for you to be in P00. We'll have a state vector for you at that time.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Go.
Roger. We have a state vector to send to you if you could ge to P00, please.
Stand by one.
Apollo 7, Houston. If you don't get your computer up here, it's all right. We can give this to you at Canary, but I do have a NAV check I can give you when you're ready to copy it.
Roger. Stand by. I'm still on a 51 here.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go.
Roger. I'll take that update now if you can send it up.
Roger.
Go to ACCEPT if you want to uplink.
Roger.
And, Donn, while it's coming up. I have a NAV check here when you're ready to copy.
Roger.
Go ahead with your NAV check, Bill.
Roger. 092 05 0000 minus 1796 minus 14661 1566. Read back.
Roger. 092 05 0000 minus 1796 minus 14661 1566.
Read back is correct.
Apollo 7, Houston. About 1 minute LOS Antigua.
Roger.
And it will be Canary at 28.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Apollo 7. Go.
Roger. We would like for you to cycle the - stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston. Which of your O2 tank fans is OFF?
Number 2 is OFF.
Number 2 is OFF. Roger. That's what we thought.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are through with the computer.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. We'd like for you to cycle your O2 tank 2 fans ON for 5 minutes, then OFF.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Canary; Carnarvon at 05. Just for a time hack, you can turn those fans back off about 38.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 7. Go.
Roger. Acquisition Carnarvon. Standing by.
Roger.
Donn, I noticed you were going through the malfunction procedure there - appeared to be just about the time we were losing you at Canary. Did you find out anything in that?
Roger. I found out whatever it was went away, I think, at least up to now.
Whatever it was went away, huh?
Right.
Did you arrive at that just from going through thin malfunction procedure? Is that how you did that?
Well, not totally.
Okay. Disregard.
Wait until Wally gets up here. He may want to do it again.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Honeysuckle; Redstone at 32.
1, 2, 3, 4. One - one update.
Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Redstone. Standing by.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Redstone; Antigua at 50.
Apollo 7. Roger.
I gather you were in kind of a hurry to get us to work down there today.
We have a few things. Roger.
I suggest somebody for tomorrow get to work on the sleep plan. You've cut us out of an hour's sleep already.
Roger.
And three have colds. I asked for an hour and a half sleep for each of us last night, and that apparently was ignored.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Go. We're just about to LOS.
At 90 hours and 40 minutes -
The sighting by - of the red airglow that was reported on the Mercury flight was experienced. It was a reddish-brown glow about the color of the lower half of the night airglow. The night airglow is about 2.8 degrees above - the top of the night airglow is 2.8 degrees above the horizon. This particular glow is 4 degrees above the top of the night airglow and 1-1/2 degrees thick.
The glow faded approximately 1-1/2 minutes later. It was confirmed by Cunningham who also was looking out my window.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. I just checked in the flight plan here regurding Wally's query there over Redstone, and I didn't get all of it, but it was something about the sleep cycle being shortened. And when I come on, the time line showed the commander's and LMP's sleep cycle extended to 91 hours. Is that the way you understood it?
That's affirmative. But you did have someone moved up the radiator test right in the middle of it.
We got the radiator test initiated at 92:30. Right?
Roger. Stand by.
We're just gonna have to put on our headsets and go to work up here.
Apollo 7, Houston. We acknowledge the error on the ground here.
Okay. Let's have the ground get to work and look at the sleep/rest cycles. We had to initiate the request as it was to get only 5 hours per shift sleep scheduled this last night. I asked for an extension and got it. I want the rest of these work periods worked out now. Apparently, we can move up burn 3. How about giving us a chance to get some sleep?
Apollo 7, Houston. Understand.
Houstaa, Apollo 7.
Go.
Roger. Bill, can you check - I think I'd like to go ahead and try to activate our primary water boiler before we commence the radiator degradation test. And than if the - we have any problems while doing the radiator degradation test, such as our primary water boiler goes down, find out if it's okay to activate the secondary loop with the radiator bypass. Over.
Roger. Stand by.
Roger. Walt, I have something here, and I think it's pretty close to what you said. I'll go through a recommended procedire here.
Okay. Is it something I have to write down or not?
No. Why don't you listen to it first? I think it's just what you wanted there.
Go ahead.
Step 1, prior to test, reservice evaporator, if not already reserviced. Step 2, begin the actual test. Three, activate primary evaporator in AUTO mode. Four, if evaporator dries out, close back pressure control valve and wait 15 minutes. Five, then reservice evaporator and reactivate in AUTO mode. Six, if evaporator dries out again, close back pressure control valve and shut down evaporator. Seven, continue test. Eight, if evaporator out count exceeds 80 degrees Farenheit, activate secopdary loop with radiators bypassed and continue test.
Only one question with that. The 80 degrees Farenheit - the rule in the past has been activate secondary loop if the temperature of the glycol evaporator outlet exceeded 60. Can you confirm that?
Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston. Regarding the 80-degree count, they say they are willing to go that high. If you activate the secondary lower than that, it compromises the test. I said that I thoight that we ought to go ahead and look at working it at 60, and they're checking into it.
Okay. Understand. I don't think there's any great big problem with letting it go a little higher, Ron. I think we've got a good chance of not having to activate it anyway, but that's just a conjecture now.
Okay.
Bill, I mean, sorry.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead, Bill.
Hey, Walt, I have a DSE recording plan for this radiator degradation test, and I'd like to pass it to you over Canary at a time that it would be convenient.
It has to do with leaving it in high bit rate for portions of the test.
Okay. Why don't you pass it to the Canaries? We're losing...
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Acquisition Canary.
Roger. Did the O2 partial pressure this morning about - almost 33 minutes ago was 240 mm of Mercury. Ready to copy your recording update.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Roger. We can now report that the handcontroller is GO.
Roger. Handcontrol is GO.
That's affirmative. The anomaly has disappeared, and I'm quite surprised you all weren't somewhat concerned about that; that wiped out our hybrid deorbit for awhile. I
We were concerned.
You'll have to clear some time for me before I get a critical test.
Roger. There was quite a lot of concern down here.
Roger. Well, it takes awhile to cheek those things out.
Roger. Also...
Let's go.
Okay. On the DSE recording for radiator degradation test, I'll read a few commets first. For radiator degradation test, spacecraft will be left in high bit rate. Spacecraft COMM system will be set up for high bit rate record by command. At the following time, place the tape recorder forward switch to FORWARD for 3 minutes, then to OFF. Ready to copy times? At 92 plus 57, 93 plus 37, 94 plus 29, 95 plus 08, 96 plus 01, 96 plus 33. Comment: do not use up telemetry command RESET switch during radiator degradation test. Note: you can only record voice while tape is running as scheduled above.
Okay. I've got the time in, and I'd like you to repeat the last comment. The attention is to - I assume you people are going to rewind and leave us with a fresh roll of tape to start with? And, we'll put it to FORWARD; I also assume you were going to leave it with my command here, and I'll have to hit COMMAND RESET switch at the start of test. I will go to FORWARD for 3 minutes and then to OFF at the following times: 92 plus 57,93 plus 57, 94 plus 29, 95 plus 08, 96 plus 01, 96 plus 33. Over.
Roger. The second time was 93 plus 37, and also you do not go to COMMAND RESET.
Okay. Understand you are going to have everything set up, and all I will use is tape recorder motion switch going to FORWARD at those times.
That's affirmative.
And we can record at the time the tape is running. Was there anything else in that last comment?
Negative. That's correct. You can only record voice whille the tape is running as schedulled at these times, and you did get...
Roger. And I assune you got a plan to dump all that out and give us a fresh tape as soon as possible afterwards. Did you read my comment that, at 91 hours into the fight, O2 partial pressure was 240 mm of Mercury?
Roger. At 91 hours, O2 partial presaure 240 mm. Also, we're setting up for a 10-hour sleep cycle for toight.
Ten hours is - How about eight?
Bill we can't do that, sleep five one time and ten the next. Try to get nearer an average of eight. We'll go for eight tonight, and that will be plenty.
Okay.
At 91 hours and 20 minutes into the flight, we took some pictures of the coastline. Hey, Wally, could I have the data?
91 hours and 20 minutes into the flight, we took several pictures on magazine S, looks like from about 43 to 47, over a coastline ending up with a large island.
Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Carnarvon.
Roger, Houston.
Apollo 7. I have a couple of items. First, in reference to the secondary loop activation during the radiator tests, we have confirmed that 80 degrees EVAP OUT TEMP is an acceptable harware limit. However, secondary loop may be activated before 80 degrees Fahrenheit as physical comfort dictates. Two, in reference to the handcontoller anomaly we would like to know which check or test did you use to verify the acceptable perrormance?
Roger. We used the standard malfunction procedure starting with the CMC troubleshooting technique. If the thing passed that test, then we went on with the rest of it - it's on page 15 - page - it's item 2, page 14 - and the final was the time itself in there where the anomaly occurred. It did not occur there again.
Roger.
zero.
And. There was a discrepansy with the malfunction only implied. This is the failure vhere the controls are stuk ON. Where the malfunctione occurs, the function will not occur.
Roger.
And in that same case, the final two digits on number 1 register of the DSKY would be 75 for pitch down. If the thing was stuck on 75, it saw immediately; it could not show.
Roger.
And, Bill, do you want me to follow the procedure that was passed up the first time we reactivated the primary water boiler? I had several steps here. I think you were probably there when you passed it up even.
Stand by on that.
Do you recall the one?
Yes, we know; we want to confirm.
And when you get it, we can use a chart update, please.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. I have a chart update.
Go.
Live 57 node at 89 plus 16 plus 24, 71.4 degrees west.
Roger.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. Yes, we vould like for you to activate it just as you did yesterday.
Okay. And if it checks down, you want to wait 15 minutes again, right?
Affirmative.
All right, just for my own information, what is a 15-minute wait, if it shuts down like that?
Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston. We will get that answer. It will take a few mimutes.
Okay. Thanks, but you understand I just wondered why we wait 15 minutes before we try to reservice the thign. I don't quite understand it.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. I've been informed that flash freezing is the reason for waiting 15 minutes.
Roger. Thank you.
Bill, is that any relation to Flash Gordon?
Oh, boy.
That's the first "oh, boy" for the flight.
Roger. You got me again.
That's the first "oh, boy" we've logged for the flight.
I'm having bacon and toast and peaches and...
Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up on LOS Carnarvon. S-band volume up, please.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Roger. Do you have any preference on the antenna for the radiator degradation tests?
Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are workin on it.
Apollo 7, Houston. The antenna for the radiator degradation test will be omni Alfa. There may possibly be a switch to B Bravo, but now it looks like A is the good one.
Roger, Bill.
We've got some beautiful pictures of the great barrier reef in New Zealand this morning.
Good. How many frames roughly? Oh - disregard.
It was about 5 frames - some frames 43 to 47.We weren't quite sure where we were until we got that, chart update. It was frame 38 to - 43 to 47 on magasin F.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute until LOS; Texas at 19.
Roger.
We're recording the effect of the second P52 alignment in preparation for the radiator test. Time is 91 hours 57 minutes. Our gyro-torquing angles are 0.044, 0.019, and 0.001. Star difference was zero, and the stars were Canopus and Ajax - correction, Canopus and Acrux.
Apollo 7, Houston through Texas.
Roger, Jack. Go.
Roger. Standing by. Donn, haw are you this morning?
Just fine, Jack.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. We'd like to know whether you have shown any restarts on the computers since we last talked to you at Carnarvon.
That's affirmative. We're now flying to attitude for the radiator degradation. I had loaded P30 incorrectly the first time. In loading P30 - trying to load it correctly - we ended up giving it an insoluble problem - here and got a restart on it.
Okay. Thanks, Walt.
We may be just a tad late getting the attitude. Why don't we give you a hack at the start time when we start the radiator degradation test? It may be a few minutes after 92:35.
Okay. That's fine.
Walt, we show two restarts here since we last saw you at Carnarvon.
We did it twice.
Ah so.
We're still in the P40, and we proceeded, to the end - trying to proceed to the end of P40, and it still didn't light the answer, and then we just reselected P00.
Okay. Fine.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're not receiving any BIOMED data. Do you have the harness hooked up?
Roger. We have the CDR connected, and he's busy with his own radiator test.
Roger. Underatand.
We have other things happening right now.
Say again, Walt?
He'll be back on BIOMED in about - shortly.
Okay. We'll be standing by.
Apollo 7, Houston. You have a GO for 77 dash 1.
Roger. Go 77-1. And we will be in attitude and starting radiator degradatoon test on time.
Roger. Copy. We're about to lose you over Bermuda; pick you up Canaries at 92:36.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Canary.
That was 92:35, and we have mannualy selected radiator 2.
Roger. Copy that.
The evaporator seem to be working for now. I wouldn't - I don't know how long we can count on it.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. We would like tape recorder forward switch to OFF, and then your DSE will be configured for this test.
Tape recorder forvard is OFF.
Hey, Jack, we have the water boiler operating, but it - in very fact - seems to be driving us against the stops here. Looks like it is going to cost us more than we had thought it would.
Roger. I'm watching it.
Apollo 7, 1 minute LOS Tananarive; Carnarvon at 93:11.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
Roger, Houston. We've been in this - we're been in this mode now for about 36 minutes, Jack, and we were in ATTITUDE HOLD and pitch and yaw, and the machine was spitting out pulses at the rate about nine to ten a minute and - which was pretty expensive. Doun has now gone to - with the pulse mode no ATTITUDE HOLD on all three axes and seems to be doing better on the thing, but you might take a look. We would like to have a figure on board here - if you can get it to us - how pulses to the pound of fuel?
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go, Jack.
Okay. Walt, on your question on the fuel usage and minimum impulse: fuel usage is about.01 pounds for each engine that pulses, so if you are using two jets for each axis, it's.02 pounds evry time it pulses.
A hundred pulses to a pound.
Yes, so you are going to get - you can get 100 jet firings per pound.
Roger. Understand. Thank you very much. We had 35 minutes worth at about ten pulses - nine to ten pulses a minute.
Okay. Copy that.
Now we are dawn to two to four pulses a minute.
Roger. Understand. And we have got about 30 seconds till we lose you here. Do you want to turn up your S-band volume! And we'll pick you up over Honeysuckle.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Honeysucle; Guaymas 93 plus 49.
Roger, Houston.
Apollo 7, Houston throyh Guaymas.
Roger, Jack.
Roger. I hear you five-by.
Roger.
I would like to ask you how the H2 stratification test went.
I haven't done that test yet. If thing get pretty well settled down, I will go ahead and run it; but it's not critical, and I'm not at 60 percent yet on either gage.
Roger. Understand. And, also, I would like to verify the position of - that the hand control power switch is at BOTH.
That is correct.
Okay. Fine.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Can you verify with your individual temps that we actually are selected radiator 2?
Apollo 7, Affirmative. We can verify that. We are watching it.
Also, if everyting is runningh nominal on this thing, we obviously don't have any battery degradstion. Is there any reason for...
Say again, 7. You got cut out.
Stand by. Is there any reason for running it the full 4 and 1/2 hours if we find that the radiators are working good? It would be nice if we could save the fuel if we could draw coclusions earlier.
Roger, 7. If it's at all possible when we look at that thing, we will try to cut it off earlier.
Roger. Understand. You know what I'm getting at, Jack.
Yes, I do.
Apollo 7, Houston. We would like you to place your O2 fan and tank 2 ON for the next 5 minutes.
Wait one.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We would like to send you a new state vector. Would you go to ACCEPT?
Okay. Let me take a little check. We're trying to monitor something on it, but.
Jack, can you aplink to that display? We're using that to fly by.
Roger. I figured that, but what we would like to do is to give you a...
That's okay, Jack. I'll turn loose.
Okay. We can send this at Canary if you rather wait.
It's clear now.
Okay. Coming up.
Apollo 7, I'm ready to give you the NAY check PAD when ypi are ready to copy.
Wait one.
We'll take it later.
Oay. Just let me know when you are ready.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are through with update; the computer is yours.
Right.
Apollo 7, Houston. You can turn your O2 tank 2 fans off.
Apollo 7, Houston through the Canaries. Standing by.
Do you want tank 2 fans on for 5 minutes?
Roger. You can turn them off now. Did you have them on for 5 minutes, Wally?
Negative. We have't turned them off yet. You want the tank 1 fans on for 5 minutes, right? We have the number 2 on now.
Okay. Wally, number 1 should be in AUTO and number 2 should be on for 5 minute and then off.
We had it on for 5 minutes.
Okay. Then you can cut them off whenever you are ready.
Do you want that ON or AUTO Two was in AUT0. Do you mant it ON?
Okay. After 5 minutes, Wally, tank 2 fans should be O-F-F, OFF.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are not reading the CDR's BIOMED data. Would you switch to LMP?
Oh, 7, we just got CDR data.
Roger. I just came on the line.
And I have this NAV check data PAD to pass up to you whenever you are ready.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. The NAV check GET is 094 plus 15 plus 00 00 plus 2310 minus 01215 089.8.
Repeat the whole, thing, will you please, Jack?
Roger. GET is 094 plus 15 plus 00 00 plus 2310 minus 01215 089.8.
Roger. 094 15 four balls plus 2310 minus 01215 089.8.
Roger. That's got it.
What's the hot scoop in Houston today?
Roger. We're about 10 seconds LOS Canary; Tananarive at 94 plus 30.
Roger. Do you have news in Houston?
Oh, it was real fine this morning.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
just crossing the States here up aroud Madagascar.
Roger. You're loud and clear. We monitored your fuel real closely during that first rev in the radiatator degradation test, and we show a usage of approximately 5 pounds. We are really watching it. We'll let you know. And I'll let Gino read you the morning news.
Good morning up there.
Roger. This is of the coast between Madagascar and Africa.
Wally, this is Geno. I've got a little news if you want to read - listen.
off the harbor at Dar Es Salaam.
7, this is Houston.
This is Apollo 7. Go.
Walt. I got a little morning news here if you would like us to send it up.
Yes, go ahead. Go ahead.
Okay. This morning the headlines have described your burn yesterday - your last burn, as "perfect." However, it goes on to say there was a 9-minute burn.
Beauhifal.
Randy Matson won an Olympic Gold Metal in his shot yesterday and so did Houston's sprinter Jim Hines who won the 100-meter dash in 9.9.
That's moving!
And the Astro's lost four ballplayers to Montreal in the expansion draft in the Natioual Baseball League.
Who did they lost?
Stand by. We'll get that for you later; I'm not sure. Wire services also picked Southern Cal as the number 1 college team in the nation, and I think Donn wii appreciate this next statement. Somehow, when Ohio State managed to slip by the Boilermakers last Saturday, they slipped into the second ranking.
Roger. I'm surprised they are not first.
I don't know how they won that saturday. Hey, it looks like your cards and letters are coming in here real strong over the past 24 hours, and your TV ratings on the Monday morning show are pretty high.
Was it announced on the Today show, or were we on it?
You are going to have a couple hundred million people standing by. As a matter of fact, with a little work, we have managed to book you for another week.
We've got our straw hats; we'll try to make a show.
Okay. Wally, it was realy a good show yesterday. The Astros lost Bateman, Brand, Pukes, and Herrera.
catcher.
The weather looks real - looks good today in the Madagascar area.
Roser.
Gene, frame 49 was a small island on the north side of Mdagascar.
Roger, Wally.
A small island similar to an atoll type.
Sounds like you guys are riding a real Cadillac up there. Things have been going real good from where we sit.
We've had some traumatic experiences what with the AC 1 end AC bus 2 slipping out. Water all over the place, but it looks to be in good shape now if nothing goes wrong.
Actually, we've found the most unconfortable suit was material.
You are 1 mtnute LOS Tananarive; we'll see you at Carnarvon.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
Roger.
Jack, we were a little late on that last 3-minute tape damp business. It shouldn't be that clean. I don't think, though.
Roger. Copy that, Walt.
Jack, can we have a chart update, please?
Coming up; stand by.
Roger.
Okay. Ready for your map update?
Go.
Okay. For REV 60, the time of the node is 95 plus 11 plus 44. Longitude 162.3 west, right ascension of 05 plus 02.
Thanks, Jack.
Give them a call; that's real great the way they come up with it in a hurry. I appreciate it.
Roger.
Jack, we're going to need an update on the sleep cycle here. We can't let Donn go to sleep for the next hour.
Okay. We'll figure that out, Wally.
Calm or not, we're going to regroup on him. At 9:00 a.m. Cape time, we've caught him in our bed.
Roger.
No rush; we'll just hang in here.
Okay.
Jack, do we have a TV pass today?
Roger. You have a TV pass, Wally.
Okay. We'll be on top.
Okay. The time of TV will be about 95 plus 25, which is about - oh, about 45 minutes from now.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Do you want to turn up your S-Band so we can lock you up over Honeysuckle?
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Roger. I had to use that gray tape that and taped that BICOMED lead together that kept coming apart. I also used it to tape the microphone together and the lightweight head set, which started, coming apart. The gray tape is pretty good gear.
Roger. Copy that.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Wally, on the sleep cycle there, we have 96 to 116 blocked out for a crew sleep cycle. This can be used in any way that the crew sees fit for a sleeping arrangements.
Very good.
Well, Jack, good ole scene in sight here again. I have Perth at night.
Houston, did you read?
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7. Houston. Copy that.
Roger.
Tha's the home of Sloans Lager where I have good beer these days.
Roger. Wally, they had an earthquake at Perth 2 days ago.
Oh, really? That's terrible.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are about 1 minute from LOS Honeysuckle; we'll pick you up at Huntsville at 95 17.
Roger. Out.
Huntsville AOS.
Apollo 7, Houston through the Huntsville. Standing by.
Huntsville two-wheel log, valid range.
Apollo 7, Houston through the Huntsville. Standing by.
Apollo 7, Houston through the Huntsville.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger. Reading you five-by, Wally.
Jack?
Go abead.
I could not hear your last transmission.
Okay. You're a little garbled - a little backgroud noise, but readable.
Hey, Jack. Understand TV coming on at 95 plus 25 Over.
Roger. Your TV time is 95 plus 25.
Jack, if we start transmitting the TV at 25, how soon do you people see that in the Center?
Walt, it has to go through the scan converter, and it doesn't take too long. We get it fairly soon.
When we initially started, we're coning down to Texas; and in the end, we end up coming through the Cape. That right?
I couldn't get that, Walt. Huntsville isn't real good, but we will catch you at California here.
Roger. Do our first TV transmissions go through Texas, and then in the end, we are transmitting through the Cape?
That is affirmative.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Go.
Roger. We'd like you to switch your S-band AUX switch.
Switch S-bana AUX to what?
S-band AUX to TV.
Roger. Going to TV.
It's on.
Roger.
How's it going, Jack. Do you read?
Not, yet, Donn.
Okay.
Starting to come through now, Donn.
Okay.
Can you see anything yet?
We're just getting - just starting to pick you up now.
Okay. We're starting to pick you up. You're looking good. It's a good picture. Looks like we can see the straps in the center seat zero g.
Roger. Can you see me? I'm in the left seat.
Affirmative.
Okay.
Looks like "From the lovely Apollo Room, high stop everything.
That's right. Coming to you live from outer space, the one and only original Apollo orbiting road show, starring those great acrobats of outer space, Wally Schirra and Walt Cunningham.
Just a minute, Wally. Let's see. Oh, it's a little message to Deke Slaton. A little bit closer, Wally. Kind of looks like something about "Are you a, are you a..."
That's right.
Looks like it says "Are you a turtle. Deke Slayton?"
That's right.
You get A for reading today, Jack.
Here comes another one. Walt, oh, that-a-way, that's the way to turn it. It says. "Paul Haney, are you a turtle?"
You'll get a gold star; perfect score!
And there is no reply from Paul Haney there.
You mean he's speechless?
Apollo 7. Houston. Would you close the back pressure valves and go to INCREASE?
Roger. Stand by.
It's a real good picture.
Roger.
You might take us on a lithe tour of your castle there if you have a chance.
Okay. Stand by.
Think we can work that out. Let's take it off the bracket and pan the cockpit a little bit.
At this point, we are looking across the cockpit over Walt Cunningham's chest toward Donn Eisele, who's controlling the spacecraft for the radiator degradation test. There you see a pen cruising by, and I need to make some notes, obviously. From there, we concentrate on the left seat's attitude control. You can see possibly two of the instruments for attitude control over there. In the center panel, we have many of the switches that position the machine, that are complicated to fly. And we monitor our systems on this side. At this point, Walt Cunningham is working on the glycol evaporator steam pressure and the waterboiler. We've had quite a few problems on this, but we've a few of them solved with a little extra special attention.
Looking across the cockpit to the right, we have most of our electrical power controls, fuel cell controls. Then as we continue across the cockpit, we'll come to the right side and that window where you can see the Gulf Coast outside, and with the weather and winds, we'we got surf galore.
The outside doesn't show too well due to the ORB rate, Wally.
I am now going to work my way down into the lower equipment bay where we have our navigation station. Here you can see the heart of the navigation system of the Apollo spacecraft - the command module, that is - the sextant and telescope. The near large object is a monocular type device - is the telescope, and adjacent to it - the small instrument - is the sextant. We acquire a known star in the telescope, put it in the center of the telescope, and then acquire in the sextant where it can be marked on a rather carefully graduated set of gimbals to give us the exact position of the star.
I'm now panning over to Wally who is going to get the telephoto lens out of its stowage compartment, and we'll attempt to do a little out-the-window photography.
Walt, the out-the-window doesn't show up very vell, Walt, due to the ORB rate...
Do you want to skip the out-the-window?
No, we'd like you to keep it inside. The ORB rate just makes it impossible to see much outside.
Roger. Understand. Okay.
Wally, this is Gene. Deke just called in, and we've got your answer, and we've got it recorded for your return.
Roger. Real fine.
We'll now show you the lower eqipment bay where we have the water control and oxygen control panel and one panel where we can also change the lithium hydroxide in flight - to change out carbon dioxide remoral.
I've just opened one of our food bays, and whenn I pulled the curtain down, you'll notice that we have a real good package that is portable. This bay is near empty. We'll switch to another bay starting tomorrow.
This an empty food bay with food rolled up rather tightly for the first 4 days of consumption. Our dietitian, Rita Rapp, will appreciate how tightly we repackaged the empty, torn-up packets of food.
And now, we will rotate the camera around through the lower equipment bay back out towards the cockpit. I'm sure - the spaghetti that you see, which is the COAS cable, that I'm holding. Walt Cunningham is working with our exercise device, using a bicycle motim to stimulate his cardiovascular system. You can take the same device in all the and use the arms in a curling motion to create an exercise in the upper torso, I'm going to swing now to the other side of the cockpit where you can see Donn is still maintining the attitude of rather a tight dedband to prepare for our radiator degradation test.
You can say we have our lighter moments.
Have you got Haney's answer yet?
No, Haney isn't talking, Wally.
Roger. And how much more time do you on want this machine?
Somebody tells me he isn't talking, but just buying.
He is buying. Thank you very much. Very good.
We will now take you down below the couches to our storage area. This bottom opens up to be a sleep station. The object below is a headrest - swings off and stows. The large bulky bag that you see off to the camera left is where our surface suits are stored at this time.
Jack, do you still have the picture working pretty well?
The picture quality isn't as good now after the handover to the Cape, but we can still make it out.
I'm going to take you through the area where the water is collecting.
This is the area where water was condensing on the pipes, just below the commander's left shoulder. You will notice that the panel here was refrigerated, and with the there is water condensation on the pipe. We vacuumed it off period/icaly, and it forms a large ball of about the size of a ping pong or golf ball.
Okay. Wally, we've lost the picture now. We copied the water condensation, and we saw the beginning of your transmission on the water condensation there.
Very good.
That was a real good pass.
Say, Jack, we've got the steam pressure off the peg, but we don't seem to be able to put it back up in the boiling range, and we are not boiling now.
Walt, we would like you to reservice the primary evaporator at 45 over the Canaries.
Reservice - you want 2 minute of water flow?
That is affirmatve, Walt; 2 minutes of water flow.
Roger. I treasure mine, Deke; it took me 6 years to get that back to even.
I couldn't copy that, Walt.
Remind Deke it took 6 years to get that question back to him.
Roger.
It's almost sixth anniversary.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Bermuda; we'll pick you up at Canary at 95 plus 46. That was a real good tour of your castle there.
Very good.
Roger. Welcome aboard.
Hey, Jack, does that go out live?
That went out live.
Is Deke Slayton out of the press conference now?
Deke isn't here right now, Donn, but Harriet's in the Control Room and watches all.
Roger. Very good. (Laughter)
Roger. Understand. Tell her hello for me.
You just did; she's nodding her head.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston through Canary.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. You are 1 minute LOS Canaries; Tananarive 96 plus 01. And, Walt, when you get the evaporator reserviced, you can put it back on the line and put the switch in AUTO.
Okay. I'll give it 2 minutes of water now.
