Inboard cut-off [Garble].
Ignition... [and we're up to thrust.] [Pause.]
You're looking good, 7.
Oh, beautiful. Tower has really jettisoned. It went way out.
Houston, do you read Apollo 7?
Roger. Five-five, Wally. You're looking good; real fine.
[Garbled] I couldn't receive you VHF.
Okay.
Tower jettisoned beautifully; did you read that?
Yes, we didn't get that, but we got Go.
Okay.
I'm reading him VHF now, Wally.
Okay.
I'll count you in on 4 minutes.
Okay.
Okay, Donn?
Yes.
Trajectory and guidance are Go, Apollo 7.
They just broke off.
Roger. She looks real good. A little bumpy ride on this stage, but very pleasant.
They gave up.
Okay, we can continue with this now. It's [garble] but while you're there, let's get the pyro breakers off.
Real fine.
On my Mark, it will be 4 minutes, Wally.
Okay.
Three, two, one.
Mark. Apollo 7, systems are Go.
Roger. Looking real fine here, Walt.
Gimbals are tight.
Gimbal check looks very good.

You're looking real fine, Apollo 7.
Roger. She's riding like a dream.
Six minutes, and we're really going.
Roger.
This center-window view is sensational.
You mean you finally got to look after the BPC went?
Man, that was a real fine...
You'd think they raised a whole circus tent in front of us.
Roger. [Pause.]
Kind of dark on top, isn't it? [Pause.]
You're right on the old button.
Very good. [Pause.]
Apollo 7 is Go at 7 minutes and [garble] Omni D [at this time.]
You cut out there, Walt. Say again?
[Garble].
[Garble].
You're kind of garbled, Walt.
Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read?
Seven loud and clear. How me?
You're coming in very garbled.
Roger [garble].
You're also garbled, Donn. I can make it out; you're right on the button, right on the mark; you're looking good.
Okay [garble]. [Long Pause.]
Eight minutes and guidance is Go.
Okay. Copy guidance Go. We copy step press and PU shift.
[Garble].
You're very garbled, 7. I'll just keep talking to you; you're looking real fine.
[Garble] bumpy road, very, very [garble].
[Garble]. [Long Pause.]
You're looking real good, Apollo 7.
Roger, we're Go for orbit at 9 minutes.
Roger. Copy. [Long Pause.]
[Garble].
I couldn't make it out, Wally, but you're looking real good.
[Garble]. [Pause.]
Apollo 7, Houston. Your trajectory and CMC [Command Module Computer] are Go.
Beautiful. Roger.
We have a predicted SECO [Sustainer Engine Cut-Off] of 10 plus 20, 10 plus 20.
Mark. Mode IV, Mode IV. [Long Pause.]
Omni Delta, Apollo 7. [Long Pause.]
SECO!
Roger. Copy.
How do like that [garble].
Man, it felt like something shooting me clean out of the seat.
