Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. Standing by.
Roger.
We're refilling the PLSS tank; we took some oxygen out of it.
Roger. Copy that.
When we first picked up the masks, one of the test buttons was depressed, and we turned on the oxygen. We had full flow through it.
Okay. Copy.
It was still a mandatory DTO.
Did they make much noise, Wally, through that depressed button?
Yes, you could hear it very easily, Tom.
Okay.
But Donn and I were still grabbing for masks rather fast.
Okay.
Well, Wally, an interesting point: about 4 more hours the total man hours up there will exceed Gemini 7.
Four more; very good.
We don't have all the PM ON, but I can imagine DELTA-P lights are all three ON.
(Laughter) Affirm. Yes, we found out we had 11 days food for 12 days work, but we'll only be short, one meal.
Roger.
I passed the word down for all command pilots to check their Flight Plans from liftoff to splash for work rest cycles and for meals.
Okay.
We ended up with 12 working days and about that many days sleep.
Yes, we'll talk to you down at the Cape, too, as soon as you get down there.
Roger.
Hey, Tom, what you might do is take a look at those sleep-day awake cycles and pick out the meal you want there, too. Sometimes they try to slip a sleep cycle in between meal B and C, for example, and you end up eating dinner for breakfast if you follow this schedule.
Will copy.
Gemini 7, Cape.
Go ahead.
Okay. Let's try that one more time. Apollo 7 from Houston. Does that sound more up to date?
Roger. Check. Say again, Deke.
Hey, listen, let's go over this reentry thing one more time since we've got a little slack here in good communications. Let me tell you what I...
One of the things I plan on doing after we break off the burns today is put on my suit and see how we stand in the couch with the helmet off.
Roger.
I'd like to give you a report on that. That'll happen, oh, probably an hour and a half or 2 hours from now.
Okay. Let me tell you...
Go ahead.
Let me tell you what our recommendation is, and then your office is going to have to play it by the best knowledge you've got up there. Okay. We're recommending you come in with the torso on obviously for the leg protection which we talked about yesterday.
Roger.
And secondly, if you can valve salvo with the helmet popped loose, keep the helmet on at least down through 50,000. Pop it so you can clear your nose, and then have it on for protection on landing. That, of course, is optional. The glove situation is the same. I don't think it matters whether they're on or off. The backup to that would be to come in without helmets or gloves, and in that case, we think you ought to provide yourselves with some head protection on the head rest.
Roger. Our problem is if we pop the helmets off, we'll have to have the gloves off to get them back on.
That is correct.
And for restraint I don't think - it's very hard to maneuver them around, and we're a little worried about getting them back on again, particularly if we pick up drogues and then the 1 g environment, and there we've got three bomb shells running around the cockpit with us on landing.
Yes, I think the glove situation is pretty clear cut. I don't think you ought to mess with those. I think it may be desirable to have head protection from the helmet on landing, however, if we can figure out how to do it.
Yes, we're keeping it and just cock it back and get to our noses.
That was what we were thinking.
But the odds of making up the neck rings again are pretty slim when we are restrained.
I suspect that's true, but I think you're probably still better off with the helmet on and the head loose than not on at all.
Okay. We'll play the game up here today.
Okay. Fine.
Roger. Thanks, for at least giving us an option on it.
Roger.
Hey, Deke, I hope somebody meets us with a safety razor on that carrier.
Say again, Walt.
Somebody meets us with a safety razor on that carrier.
Roger. I think there may be a couple.
The caption in the Flight Plan is beards are NO-GO.
Got that.
that pulse control is beautiful.
Copy.
Is Tom still there?
Roger.
Okay. For roll, Tom, with one ring, it's 8 pulses for two-tenths of a second.
Yes.
For pitch and yaw, it's about 10 pulses per two-tenths of a degree per second.
Okay. Got it, and that's using just the one ring there, right? Are you using just -
Just rings in the roll, yes.
Yes.
The pitch is pure.
Okay.
Apollo 7, Houston. Wally, does the sound on minimum impulse sound like Gemini with those cracks?
Negative. It sounds like, the best description we've thought of is like hitting on steel drums in a steel band.
Yes. Okay.
It's sort of like the Gemini, but a lot worse. Very discernible, every one of them.
Okay.
They are in a different tune. The pitches are about one note lower than yaw, and roll is sort of all individual note.
Okay.
Land ho.
Say, Jack, can you give me a map update for the closest...
Okay. Stand by. Okay, Walt, I've got it. Are you ready to copy?
Go.
Okay. You're coming up on REV 137 here. The time 217 plus 25 plus 25. The longitude of the node 144.1 degrees east.
Copy.
Frame 61, magazine R for Romeo, and very close behind the time off the west coast.
Okay.
And a very uninteresting.
Our target is wide open.
Roger.
Jack, if you'll watch the you'll see the trunnion start to decrease, and we're tracking AUTO optics on the target.
Okay. We're watching P22.
roll right about 5 degrees to optimize on the target pickup.
Okay.
Jack, you can see her sitting just about at ORB rate, pitch down, a little bit to go. We got a better view.
Guaymas, we can see your station.
Guaymas, Apollo 7. Buenos dias and muchas gracias.
We copied, Wally, but I don't know whether Guaymas got it or not.
Roger.
It sounds Spanish to me.
Si.
How's our cut for going over Mexico City?
Stand by one, Wally.
Okay. It looks like you're going to be coming fairly close to Mexico City.
Yes, it looks like that from the path we're going. North or south? Looks like we're going to be north.
That's what we show.
Roger.
Tom, one of the real kicks out of this left seat is you can sit here and just scrunch it down like a submarine commander working with a periscope. I've got the line in right now with number 1 eight ball, and we can just cruise back and forth with no strain at all.
Okay. That's out of the number 1 window and the eight ball.
Number 2 window and the number 1 eight ball.
Roger.
You can drop it down about 2 or 3 feet on the slightest motion. This IVA stuff is great sport. No problem at all.
Out in front of the number 1 ball to take the rates out.
Wally, Houston. What about when you're in local vertical in the dock position. Can you see the horizon pretty well?
Yes.
Okay. And I asked Donn late the other night when you were asleep, to make some marks on that side window just with a pencil so we can calibrate the simulator later on, you know, for the attitude out the side window.
Oh, you mean for zero pitch?
Yes.
Tom, I can give you a couple of figures on that. If your head is laying in the center couch at zero pitch, the horizon cuts through right about the middle of the rear side of both number - both side windows, number 1 and 5.
Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Now, you can't see across the cockpit and see the horizon, though. That's the center couch.
Okay.
Don't give up that center window. That's a dream if they can get it to be fixed up right.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Landmark is a NO-GO with solid overcast.
Okay. Copy. Wally, the power down that was scheduled at 217, we would like to delay that in order to get a state vector update to you probably through Guam about 217 30 and then we can power down after that.
Roger. Are you going to check our instrument, or have you found that it is all right?
Okay. I haven't gotten the report on that, but I'm waiting for it, and I will get it up to you as soon as I get it.
I'd like to get that before we power down. I'd rather not screw it up tomorrow.
Okay.
What is the new time for power down?
Okay. The power down will be about one half hour later. It will probably be about 217 45. We want to get the state vector update at Guam, and if we don't finish it there, we'll get it through Hawaii.
We'll keep a computer on the line till we get a GO on the erasable.
Okay. Real fine.
Apollo 7, we'll pick you up at Ascension at 47.
And the sixth magazine, R for Romeo...
Landmark 144.
Apollo 7. Houston though Ascension.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger. Wally, we have got an update on the Flight Plan for a sleep period here.
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. CMP sleep period from 216 through 225, CDR amd LMP from 225 to 234.
That's affirm, but -
9 hours apiece. We'll see -
maybe we can stuff into it.
Walt, the nodal crossing on REV 137 is 114.1 east.
On 137?
Affirm.
On that last one, we got five marks and corrected the landmark.
Oki. Copy that.
It was wide open on the coast only I found that the landmark had a three-fourths mile uncertainty, and we picked it up and got a picture of it, too.
Sounds real good, Walt.
We are trying to get pictures of the landmarks that don't have any.
Okay.
Hey, Jack.
Go ahead, Walt.
Roger. We've taken numerous packs of 70mm, S0121. The first batch we took we shot at ASA 64 so we wouldn't have to reset the light meter for S0368, and all the other S0121 packs have been shot at an ASA of 50, and I would like to make sure that you get that to the people that process these. I've marked the pack that was shot at ASA 64.
Okay. Copy that.
This is really a great machine for taking pictures out of. There are five windows; almost every time you glance up, there is one of us on it.
That sounds like a pretty good technique there, looking with one of the five windows there.
Yes, we're really in great shape. Even in drifting flight -
We have really got a lot of good pictures.
Good show.
I wish we had a heck of a lot more film up here.
Okay. We have 1 minute to LOS over Ascension, and we are going to gave a data dump over Guam this time, Wally.
Roger.
On magazine R for Romeo, on landmark 227, on the east coast of Africa, the landmark is wrong. There's a bridge over what was a strip of land. There's a photograph on magazine R, and the landmark-checking exercise may not have worked out. The frame number on magazine R for Romeo is 63.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Roger, we're powering down the SCS only now.
Jack, do you read?
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, we're about to lose you over Tananarive. We'll pick you up at the Mercury at 208.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. Standing by.
Roger. Wally, we will stand by for Guam.
Are you going to update there?
Affirm. We are going to update at Guam.
When do yon want the - are you going to go on the erasable?
Wally, we are going to make another erasable at Guam when we get a good elevation angle as a further check on the Carnarvon data which we are having a hard time getting back from Carnarvon.
Okay.
Apollo 7, opposite omni.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. If you will go to ACCEPT, we will send yon the state vector update.
You got her.
Okay. Coming up. Then I have the NAV check for you when you are ready to copy.
Go, Jack.
Okay. 221 plus 30 plus 0000 minus 2953 minus 05172 1803.
Roger. 221 plus 30 plus four balls minus 2953 minus 05172 1803.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. We are finished with the dump - I mean, we are finished with the state vector update.
Say again.
We are finished with the state vector update. The computer is yours.
Good.
Okay, Apollo 7. We are ready for your E mod dump; could you key in the...
Just a second.
Houston, this is Apollo 7.
Go ahead.
Okay. The computer system is clear.
Okay. We are ready for the VERB 74.
Computer is syncing, apparently.
Okay.
On the way down.
Roger.
Okay, Apollo 7. We are about to lose you here at Guam. We pick you up at Hawaii at 45.
Okay. Wally, we are through with the E mod dump.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Roger. Loud and clear.
You too.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger, Jack.
Okay. Donn, it's going to be about an hour before we have a print-out of this E mod dump, and you can leave the computer powered up at your option.
Roger. Wilco; and Donn is in bed.
Okay. Somebody else has got a high voice then.
Wilco. Over and out.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, Wally.
Can you read the DSKY?
Affirmative.
Notice how tight I'm holding it in. Pulse now.
Are you impressed?
Roger.
Pardon?
Affirmative.
That's pretty tight, isn't it?
Roger.
Come on, you can see through that one.
What - have you got all the switches off, Wally?
The CDU's are locked up; the IMU is powered down. Donn just came out of his bed. He was wondering, too.
I was looking at SCS rate.
No fair. That is pretty tight pulse, isn't it, Tom?
Yes, that's really holding it.
Okay. I'll be a good guy.
Well. Wally, next time around we will give you a call, and you should be passing over this Typhoon Gloria, and it will probably be nighttime, but you should see lots of thunderstorms down below you, just over the Mercury.
We got a picture of her earlier today.
Okay.
She's pretty big one. I didn't see it; Donn did. And the eye was very apparent and a very large storm.
Right. It's given the Mercury a few swells out there.
Ah ha. It reminds me of a former Mercury CAP COMM.
Has Alan B. been in today?
No. I was going to remind him of it, though, whenever I saw him.
(Laughter)
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Roger. Looks like the only DTO we still have running here, we got to make another cut at the CRYO stratification test. I'd like to know what are your intentions and what percentage to do that. I would like to not save that thing until Monday night, for example.
Okay. We will get it to you, Walt.
It takes quite a while till somebody pressurizes it. It will take a couple of hours, probably, to run both of them.
Okay.
Well, Jack, could you give me an update when the time is appropriate for us to look for Gloria?
Okay. Will do.
Good.
And I guess we need an update on our fuel expended for the day - actually, it should be the fuel remaining - for the chart.
Okay. In work.
Roger.
Okay. Wally, on information, you should be ready to receive -
7, are you reading? Houston.
Reading you now. You were cut out there, though.
Okay. We had a handoff. You should be seeing Gloria about 219 plus 04, somewhere around that time, and the chart update values - 539.
Roger. Thank you, 539.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Guaymas; we will pick you up at Tananarive at 37.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Roger, are you reading at Tananarive today?
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Roger. Tom, we're reading you.
Roger. You reading us loud and clear?
There's the usual amount of noise.
Hey, Tom, we've decided we're only going to stay up here one more day.
correction, 1 more day.
Say again, Wally.
We think - all of us have decided we're only going to stay up here one more day. We're going to come back Tuesday morning regardless.
I think all of us are thankful we have 1 more day. then we can come back home again.
Roger. Evidently you're reading us. We can barely read you. I'll give you a social update. Father is taking Jo to the ball game this afternoon. In fact, Lo and Harriet are also going to the ball game.
Lo and Harriet going to the ball game, too?
Roger.
That's news.
What game is it?
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
We would like to do a fuel cell O2 purge.
Go ahead, we have acquisition.
I can't help you until we get acquisition.
Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Tananarive; Mercury at 01.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury.
Roger, Jack.
Walt, your E mod dump is GO. You can power down the computer.
Roger.
Jack, who is playing the Oilers today?
The Jets are playing the Oilers today.
Okay.
Fendell's giving five points.
I'll take him.
Hey, Ed - I mean Tom, tell Ed I'll go for two and take the Oilers and five.
He's covered.
Candy from a baby.
We'll call the results up in about 5 hours or so.
If we're blacked out up here, we'll power down the computers shortly, and wait to see if Gloria's hanging out around this area.
Okay. You should be coming right up on it now, Wally.
Roger.
I agree; nobody should miss Gloria.
It's a real big G, I guess.
No comment.
We have a shoreline that seems very brightly lighted up ahead of us here.
Say again, Wally.
A shoreline about - oh, 50 or 60 miles long, and it's lighted up; looks like about two or three cities.
Roger.
We saw some lightning, and a lot of it - oh, about a minute or so ago.
Roger. You should be passing over it about now, or already passed over the main part of the eye.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're ready to purge the other fuel cells.
Houston, this water gun after 10 days use is getting difficult to operate the trigger you use to squirt it; you have to force it back and forth. The cold water tap on the food preparation panel down there also seems to be getting just a little bit tough to operate.
Okay. Copy that, Walt.
Apollo 7, Houston. We ran into the same thing with the water gun in the later Gemini flights. It became stiffer as the days progressed.
Roger. Thanks.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Guam; we pick you up at Hawaii at 21.
Roger.
I don't know it we told you, but the water that seems to be the freest of gas is the hot water spout.
Okay. Copy.
I think that's why we're fans of the reconstitutable food.
Roger.
Apollo 7. Houston through Hawaii. Standing by.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Yes, Jack.
Walt, what we would like to do is get - sometime here, get a heater profile on those SPS heaters. Can you copy? It won't take any attitude control or anything; just some heater ON times.
How long will this thing take to run?
It's a total of 6 hours; I got same times here for you.
Okay. I'll stick with the Flight Plan, and we'll probably get finished up when Donn's up.
Okay. Real fine. Let me know when you are ready to copy.
Okay. Are these the SPS line heaters that I asked you to turn on and check about 2 days ago?
That's affirmative.
Okay. It's going to help to use the A/B position. I saw no change at all in the A position today.
Roger.
Walt, let me know when you are ready to copy this and the Flight Plan.
I'm ready to copy.
Okay. At 220 plus 57, put the heater switch in A, the SPS line heater switch to A. Okay. At 223 plus 57, put the SPS line heater switch to A/B.
And, at - you want to terminate the test at 227 plus 11 or any time the propellant temperature or oxidizer T align temperature reaches 75 degrees.
Did you copy that, 7?
Jack, I read termination, and I read the 223 plus 57, and after that I couldn't read you.
Okay. Let me give it again. We are over the Huntsville here, and I'm only reading about two-by. At 220 plus 57, SPS line heaters to A. At 223 plus 57, SPS line heaters to A/B. Terminate the test at 227 plus 11, or any time the propellant temperature, or line oxidizer line temperature reaches 75 degrees.
Jack, I assume you're collecting the data on it. Do you want any data from me?
Okay. Walt, the only thing we want yon to note, if you switch the heater position when you are not in station contact, would you log the time.
Okay. Will you be in station contact at 220 plus 57?
Affirmative. These times are all predicated on being in station contact at that time.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay. We are about 1 minute LOS Huntsville; we'll pick you up at Tananarive at 220 plus 13.
Roger.
Huntsville LOS signal very weak, VHF down is also varying in amplitude. Huntsville LOS.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Roger. Jack, how do you read?
Reading you about two-by.
Yeah, would it be possible to slip that - piece that for P22...
Jack, would you check my running the hydrogen stratification test about 20 to 15 percent range ow longer.
some place in that range, no lower, and the O2 stratification test between, say, 30 and 45 percent, no lower than that?
Walt, you're coming weak and garbled. Copied the "did I check about the stratification test." We are in the process of doing this now, seeing if we can move it up a little.
Roger. Out.
I'll check with you at Mercury.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Tananarlve; we pick up the Mercury at 37.
Apollo 7, Houston through the Mercury. Standing by.
Jack, how do you read?
Hey, Jack, how do you read?
You're about four-by, Walt.
Okay. I don't know if you read my last contact or not. I wanted to see if we couldn't schedule the CRYO stratification test for no less than 15 to 20 percent on the hydrogen and probably no less than 30 to 35 percent on the oxygen. This is to preclude being involved with it some time late Monday.
Roger. Walt, we're doing that. We're trying to move it up a little bit - oh, we're talking around 232 hours now.
Okay. Thank you very much.
Jack, we have a third crewman verifying all three oxygen masks now; I just made a mandatory test of the third one.
Okay. I copy that.
Apollo 7. Opposite omni.
And, Walt, I have the block data number 24 for you.
Roger.
I'm ready to copy, Jack, and tell John Llewlyn we're glad we never had to verify how accurate or disaccurate this stuff was.
Say again on that.
Tell John Llewlyn we're glad we never had a chance to verify the accuracy of these blocks.
Roger.
Jack. Go.
Okay. Block data number 24: 141 dash Alfa Charlie minus 181 minus 0100 222 plus 51 plus 52 6955, 142 dash Alfa Charlie minus 040 minus 0080 224 plus 26 plus 00 6134, 143 dash Alfa Charlie plus 028 minus 0200 225 plus 58 plus 13 5734, 144 dash Alfa Charlie plus 101 minus 0310 227 plus 30 plus 42 5293, 145 dash Alfa plus 230 minus 0270 229 plus 06 plus 36 4372, 146 dash 2 Charlie plus 288 minus 0270 230 plus 43 plus 18 3726. End.
Roger. My readback follows: 141 dash Alfa Charlie minus 181 minus 0100 222 plus 51 plus 52 6955, 142 dash Alfa Charlie minus 040 minus 0080 224 plus 26 plus 00 6134, 143 dash Alfa Charlie plus 028 minus 0200 225 plus 58 plus 13 5734. Over.
It was just a break, Jack. 144 dash Alfa Charlie plus 101 minus 0210 (should be 0310) 227 plus 30 plus 42 5293, 145 dash 2 Alfa plus 230 minus 0270 229 plus 06 plus 36 4372, 146 dash 2 Charlie plus 288 minus 0270 230 plus 43 plus 18 3726. Over.
Roger. That's got it, except that should be 142 dash Alfa Charlie.
Houston, Apollo 7. Over.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Roger. SPS line heaters going to A.
Roger.
Can you give me a readout on my O2 manifold pressure, please?
Roger. 102.
Roger. 102.
Can you hit me again with the manifold pressure?
103.
And the redundant component check is still in work. I'll give you a GO next sight.
Roger.
Hey, Jack. Redundant component check looks like it's GO.
Roger. Copy that.
Apollo 7. We are 1 minute LOS Hawaii; Ascension for a short pass at 221 plus 38.
Roger.
Magazine R, 64, 65, and 66, of the east coast of South America and Argentina.
Argentina, Uruguay or - oh, that's in very - it's the very southern tip of Brazil.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. Standing by.
It's about time you got back on.
How are you reading?
Roger. A little garbled there, but good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Hey, Ron. Log LMP for 25 clicks of water.
Roger. Six clicks?
Houston, Apollo 7. Over.
Houston. Go.
Roger. Ron, will you log me 25 clicks of water, please?
Wilco. Twenty-five clicks.
Hey, Ron, we'll all be off COMM here for about 30 seconds. We are trying something.
7, Houston. Say again.
Roger. I will be off COMM for about 30 seconds here.
Roger.
Back with you, Ron.
Roger. About LOS. We still show your secondary glycol loop activated.
Yes, I've got them secured there now. We've been all tied up with trying to simulate the few things about reentry now. We're trying to rig couches so it's okay with heads - helmets off.
CDR, 35 clicks of water in the last few hours.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Roger, Ron.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. Standing by.
Roger, Ron.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. We show the secondary loop still on. Is that your intention?
It is off now.
Ron, I just finished putting the suit on.
Roger.
Without gloves - without a helmet. Do you read?
Roger.
And strapped in, blocking my feet up, and I feel that is the way we are going to come in Monday morning - Tuesday morning. It is with suits, no gloves, no helmets, and I'm going to pad the headrest on either side and wear our COMM carriers, not our lightweight headsets.
Roger.
Our heads are still too stuffed up to try to come in with our helmets on and take them off and try to blow our nose.
Roger. Understand.
Okay. You might pass it on to Deke that I actually got in with a suit on, strapped down and tried it out.
Will do.
Very good.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS; Hawaii at 34, and I may have some ball scores here shortly.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. Standing by.
I hear you loud and clear.
Roger. The same.
What's the late news on a Sunday evening?
I've got a final on the Dallas and Minnesota football game. Dallas 20, Minnesota 7.
That's nice. Any scores on the Oilers yet?
No, they just started at three.
Oh, I see.
I don't have the score yet.
Looks like our Kansas boy, Jim Ryun, got second in the 1500 meters in the Olympics.
Oh, really. He's the miler, isn't he, Ron?
Roger.
Who got first?
Kip Kano of Kenya.
Yes, he's pretty reliable on it.
Right.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone.
Roger.
Roger. When you get a chance, request pyro A and B volts and batt C volts.
Roger, Ron. Batt C is reading 36 volts.
Roger.
Looking over tomorrow's Flight Plan.
Go.
I see no hole for the TV game, except for the 237-hour period. And there I think we would have it as a very passive affair, where we don't do anything to set it up; just hook it up and let her rip.
Roger.
Now the next period just prior to 239 hours, I'd say we were busy.
Roger.
So during that ninth period, I guess we'll come across the States, the 237 plus 30. Looks like we could do it if we just plug it in and turn it on.
Roger. I'm not sure what we had scheduled or if we had any. Let me check, and I'll pass the word up.
We're not volunteering; that's our only out, though.
Roger.
Our series ends tomorrow.
Hey, that's right.
Yes, we had it coming on Monday morning, Tuesday morning, correction.
Right.
Telling you ahead, happily.
That's good.
Pyro A 36.8, pyro B 36.8.
Roger. And I have your ampere-hours remaining.
Roger. Wait one - look, I've got another hour to run on SPS line heaters A before going to A slash B, right?
Concur.
Go ahead with batteries.
Batt A 26.7; correction, 27.6 for batt A. Batt B 25.2, batt Charlie 39.5.
27.6, 25.2, 39.5.

Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. Standing by.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger. The same.
7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Walt, you might be interested to know that when you were operating on the secondary loop there, the primary outlet temperature went down to about 9 to 10 degrees.
Glycol evaporator outlet?
Negative. Your radiator outlet temperatures.
Ok ay. The heaters didn't come on, though?
Negative. Everything is operating normally now, though.
Did it go down to plus 9 or 10, or minus?
Plus. Plus 9 or 10.
Okay. No sweat. That's my fault, Ron. We were busy fiddling around here with the reentry plans, checking out the couch stuff.
Roger. I just thought, maybe, you'd be interested.
Hear it's brisk.
It sure is.
Do you have a copy of our canister card there?
Wait one, and I can pick it up.
Okay.
7, Houston. I have it now.
Apollo 7, Houston. I have your canister card now.
Roger. We just did change number 19.
Roger.
Which puts canister 21 in.
Roger. One more to go.
And then they had it that way, but we'll do it. I think we'll put number 1 back in again and we're all done.
Roger.
Both guys are getting along. We found we were out of a meal when we got all done today, too.
I see what you're saying.
There's no crisis there. We're just thinking about it.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS; Mercury at 50.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury.
Roger, Ron. I read you loud and clear.
Roger. The same. We have no data from Mercury this time.
Okay.
We'd like to delay switching to AB on the SPS line heaters until we acquire Guam.
What's wrong down there?
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead - go ahead, Ron.
Roger. We're using the FM BIOMED channels for some special instrumentation that are different instrumentation. So we'd like to cycle the CRYO fans, tank 2 fans, once we acquire Guam. Now, I'll give you the go on it.
Roger.
Say, Ron, you have a map update for us?
Affirmative.
7, are you ready to copy?
Go.
Roger. REV 141 GET 233 plus 26 plus 34, longitude 21.7 east.
Ron, do you mean 223 or 233?
Roger. I mean 223 - 223.
That's a real up update?
Yes.
we'll have that redone.
Apollo 7, Houston. Request SPS line heaters to A/B and your temperature readout.
Well, we were right there when you called for it, and I'm reading on my gage, for what it's worth, about, oh, 67.
Roger.
Walt, we're reading 65 down here, and we'll delay the CRYO tank fan cycle until Redstone. Not enough time, now.
Well, I can do it by myself, can't I?
Negative. We'd like to get some - we've got some special readouts coming down on it. We'd like to pick it up over a station. Both the ON and the OFF cycle of the fans.
Okay.
And, 7, I have a one-line Flight Plan update.
Go with it.
Roger. At 224 plus 47, it's a down voice backup check over Ascension. We will command all switching from the ground.
Roger. I'll stand by, then.
Roger.
Approaching AOS Redstone at 21.
Roger. Redstone, 21, and see if downvoice backup node's on our COMM slide rule, Ron.
On magazine N, frames 40 and 41, the Tuamotu Archipelago, southeast of the Canton tracking station about longitude 140 to 145 west.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone.
Roger. we're waiting for data before we cycle the CRYO fans.
You say you're troubleshooting the switch on the backup?
This is part of it, but we're using the FM that we use to have the BICMED on it, to get some more data.
Roger. We've got that.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Apollo 7, Houston. Request O2 tank 2 fan ON.
Roger. We have our.
Roger. Twenty clicks for LMP.
15 clicks?
Roger.
Say, Ron, we just went by the Tuamotu Archipelago out here, and for 4 minutes solid we went by coral reefs, atolls, I should say.
Roger.
That seems [garble more than nothing at all.
Wow!
You should be locked up with him for 11 days.
That's right.
7, Houston. I've got some football scores here. New York 20, Houston 14.
Bad news.
Roger.
Are you sure that's the correct score?
That's affirmed.
Looks like New York had a good day.
Roger.
only gave me five points.
San Francisco was 26, New York 20; Cleveland 30, Baltimore 20; St. Louis 31, Washington 14; Chicago 29, Philadelphia 16; Green Bay 14 and Detroit 14.
They are slowing down this year.
Jack.
What about the Rams?
Apollo 7, Houston. O2 tank 2 fan OFF.
Roger.
7, Houston. One minute LOS; Ascension 47.
Roger. What time Ascension?
At 47.
Roger.
7, Houston. L.A. 27, Atlanta 14.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Roger, Ron.
Roger..
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Apollo 7, Houston. Voice check. You'll be coming down - down voice backup.
Very well. Do you want me to configure now?
Negative. We have configured from the ground. All you have to do is talk.
What am I here for?
(Laughter) Just talk.
I'm testing down voice backup, and I wish I had those little command switches so I could throw my own.
Yes, right. That's a pretty good deal; all you punch is one button and it switches all those things.
Are you coming through?
That's right. Ask them if they can rock their spacecraft down there, will you?
Okay. That down voice backup, that's good voice; nice and clear.
Okay. Would you ask them to please switch my ranging back on and down voice back up to where they would like it?
Roger. Your ranging is still on.
Thank you. You get better down voice without it.
Roger. We concur, but we want to test it this way, also. That's why we're checking this time now, Walt, is ranging down voice backup.
Say that again.
Roger. We are checking down voice backup along with ranging on this test.
I understand, Ron.
By the way, L.A. beat Atlanta 27 to 14.
Roger. They're still undefeated then. Right?
I assume so. San Diego over Denver 41 to 17.
Okay. I'm going to bed. Good night, Ron.
Roger. Good night. We'll see you tomorrow.
Hello, there.
Hey, good morning.
How did the Oilers do?
Not too well. They lost to New York 14 to 20.
Oh.
Hey, Donn.
Yeah, Ron.
Roger. You better check your food. Wally said he was one meal short there and not quite sure where he's going to get it so you better check your food and see if he's eaten yours.
Yes, thanks for the tip. I'll be keeping an eye on him...
Okay....
I don't know what he did while I was asleep.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS. Mercury at 26.
Roger. Mercury, 26.
Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. Standing by.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.

Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS; Redstone at 57.
Roger, understand.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Loud and clear.
7, Houston. We'd like to power up the CMC over Redstone and then power down over Ascension.
Okay. Fine.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Go.
Roger. We're just about due for a cycle on our H2 heaters, and we can finish this last CRYO H2 stratification test there if it's convenient for you to turn the H2 heaters and fans off at this time.
Roger. I can turn the heaters and fans off at this time.
Roger. Proceed and then this will start the H2 stratification test.
All right. Fine. Starting at 26 02.
Roger.
7, Houston. We read 233 psi in tank 1 - H2 tank 1 and 231.3 in tank 2.
Roger. 233, 231. Thank you, Ron.
Roger.
our meters read - well it's a little hard to resolve it that close - I'd say about 228 and 226 on our meter.
Roger. Copy.
Looks like we're about 5 pounds below you.
Apollo 7, Houston. About 30 seconds LOS; Ascension at 23, and your state vector is good.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Roger. Read you, Donn.
Roger.
7, Houston. They verify SPS line heaters were turned off.
Negative. They were not turned off. Did you want them off now?
Wait one; stand by.
7, Houston. We were predicting that we would be up to 75 degrees here, but the curve tapered off, so we will advise when to turn them off.
Okay. I'm still reading 72 degrees right now.
Roger. Concur.
Could you give me the hydrogen pressures again, please?
Roger. Right now H2 tank 1 232, H2 tank 2 230.
Roger.
And - Apollo 7, Houston - we're GO for CMC power down.
Okay.
7, Houston. Have you ever taken the optics eyepieces off and looked through the optics out there?
Have we taken them off, did you say?
That's affirmative, or do you normally leave them mounted in position?
Oh, about fifty-fifty. Sometimes we put them away, and sometimes we just leave them there. It depends on what we're going to do; if we're going to be real active in the LEB doing other things, we usually put them away because they're in the way.
Roger. I've got little a degradation type thing I'll pass up to you here shortly.
Okay. Fact is, they're stored right now.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. You can turn the H2 heaters on now, and that stratification test at your convenience.
Okay. Heaters going on now.
Roger.
On this optics degradation, what we want to do is remove the sextant and telescope eyepieces, and then observe the internal lens of both the sextant and the telescope. This would be with your eyeball about a foot away from the panel during a dayside pass with the optics pointed somewhere above the horizon.
Okay. Optics pointed where, above the horizon?
Optics above the horizon. And you should be able to observe some deposits on this objective lens similar to the ones that are on the windows.
Well, there may be some, but it sure doesn't affect the view that you...
Okay.... get through the optics eyepieces.
They're as good now as they were when we took off.
Say again, Donn.
Okay. I say with the eyepieces installed, the view the view through the sextant telescope is as good now as it was when we lifted off.
I still didn't copy that very well, Donn.
Just disregard.
You're clear now; say again.
Okay. When the eyepiece is installed, the view through the optics will be as good now as it was at the start of flight.
Roger. Understand. What we would like to do is get your evaluation with the eyepieces off and see if you can see any deposits on those lens off.
Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS; Mercury at 03.

Roger. Give me a couple of minutes.
Roger.

Roger. Go ahead, Ron.
Roger. On the H2 pressures, we show 256 and 254.
Ron, you faded out...
say again.
Roger. Your H2 tank pressures, 256 and 254.
And - 7, Houston - our oxidizer line temperature now reads 80 down here.
7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS; Redstone at 32, and verify SPS line heaters off.
7, Houston. Verify SPS line heaters off.
Roger. Line heaters are OFF now. The maximum temperature we got was 72 degrees.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. Standing by.
Roger, Houston.
Roger.
I completed that stratification test, and there doesn't appear to be anything.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 7, Houston. I have a Flight Plan update when you're ready to copy.
Okay. Ron, stand by for just one here.
Roger. No hurry.
Go ahead with your Flight Plan update, Ron.
Roger. At 228 plus 20, optics degradation test. That's what we were talking about a while ago. At 229 plus 50, oxygen fuel cell purge; at 230 plus 00 02, CRYO stratification test number 3. We will advise further details later.
Okay.
At 232 plus 00, extend playmate's sleep period to 234 plus 00.
Roger. Got that.
Normal SPS burn prop ACCEPT. At 236 plus 00, dump waste water to blank percent - it's about 50 percent. We'll update that later.
Okay.
We want to get the right amount to be in the tank for deorbit.
Is there a right amount for deorbit?
That's affirmative. They're full, in other words, for deorbit. About 90 percent is what we're trying for.
Oh, I see. Okay.
At 236 plus 50, backup GDC/IMU alignment; delete SCS backup align. At 237 plus 16, TV turnon.
Ron, I don't see how that's going to work out too well. We're here - that's right in the middle of the pass that we're doing this alignment, and you've got to be darkened down from in here.
Wait a minute; I think I stated that wrong. That should be 237 plus 16.
Yes, I see what you mean. Okay, Ron. But you may not get it because if we're not finished with that alignment, we're going to keep on with it.
Roger. It's just a passive TV pass anyhow.
Okay. Wait a minute. Was that the end of night period? Oh, I guess it is; my Flight Plan's a little low.
Yes, it was also there at CDR request.
Right; I've got it here. Yes, that'll work out.
Okay. TV pass is 237 plus 18 to 237 plus 30. At 237 plus 30, oxygen fuel cell purge.
At 238.
You're fading out...
Ron.
Roger. We're about LOS; I'll pick you up at the Canaries at 03.
Okay.
Apollo 7. Houston through Canaries.
Roger. This is Apollo 7.
Roger. Loud and clear, Donn. We can continue with the Flight Plan update, if you're ready.
Go ahead.
Roger. Did you get the fuel cell O2 purge at 237 plus 30?
No. I'll start there.
Roger. At 237 plus 30, oxygen fuel cell purge.
Okay. We just had one at 230.
That's affirmative. This is the one just prior to burn to make the fuel cell take more of the load.
Oh, I see. Okay.
At 238 plus 30, delete Bravo prior Huntsville and Alfa prior Guam or Guaymas.
Roger. At 239 plus 06, present GETI burn 7.
Okay. I've got a change on that - on the one I gave up to you. At 230 plus 00, delete that CRYO stratification test.
Yes. Now it looks like the heat leak is such that the heat leak into the tanks is equal to the usage out, and the pressures are remaining constant now; so you can't do one.
(Laughter) Oh, okay.
Roger. And one thing I wanted to make clear at 236 plus 50...
Yes.
Roger. That's a backup GDC alignment, and the IMU is not to be caged. It's an alignment test.
Right. We'll leave the IMU in their zone, probably fly back to it.
Roger. A little advanced information: looks like you only have about 12 to 13 minutes to get those stars in there, and we plan to pass up some information for a local vertical attitude and kind of an AOS time at the stars.
Oh, okay, fine. That will help. Why do you say that we've only got 12 or 13 minutes?
That's the only time the stars will be in the field of view.
Oh, swell.
And they'll start going under the horizon after that time.
Oh, that's not such a hot deal, is it? This is supposed to be our backup alignment method. If we've only got 12 minutes per night pass to find them, that's kind of a difficult thing to do if you don't have help.
Roger. We understand. That's the best we can do at this setting, though.
Oh, it looks like a poor choice of stars.
I copied that.
Yes, that's interesting. I noticed during the curious night pass that the other cross was just barely above the horizon, and that was only for a few minutes, and then it started going down.
Roger.
7, Houston. We could use a kind of a crew status report there on yourself if you've got a chance.
Roger. I'm still holding up. Had a real good night's sleep - a good 8 hours, I guess - and cold seems better; at least, I'm not blowing my nose as much, and my ears stay clear more than a greater proportion of the time than they were earlier.
Yes, that sounds real good.
I don't know whether Wally and Walter's have improved or not; I don't think they have, to speak of. I took one Lomatil before I went to sleep. That was around - well, whenever it was that I went to sleep.
Roger.
I took it about 215 or 216.
What was that - 215 or - oh, that was the time. Okay.
About that, 215 hours or thereabouts.
Roger.
And I haven't kept too close a track of the water; I think it's been around 20 or 30 clicks.
Roger.
A combination of before I went to sleep and then after I got up.
About 30 seconds LOS at Canaries; we've got Madrid for about 1 minute.
Roger.
It will be Redstone at 08.
Roger. Redstone at 08.
Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. Standing by.
Roger, Houston.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Houston. Go.
I looked through the optics, and I couldn't tell much in the way of dirt in there. The sextant looked clean as a whistle. There were some little light spots in the telescope which could be dirt particles catching light, you know, reflecting.
Roger. But you didn't see anything that looks like the command module windows?
That looked like what?
Any of the deposits we have on the command module windows.
No, I couldn't tell anything like that. You mean on the surface - the inner surface of the - next to the spacecraft, or are you looking through the whole thing?
Well, looking through the whole thing and also on the inner surface anywhere that you can see.
No, I didn't see anything like that - that looked like our window degration at all.
Roger. Copied.
They were clean as a whistle except for the little specks on the telescope which do not apparently affect the field of view when you've got the eyepiece in.
Roger. Sounds good then.
Yes, I haven't noticed any change at all in the way the stars look or the ground looks from the day we took off.
Roger.
In fact, on some of the flights, I'd like to suggest they rig up some type of a deal where you could mount a camera on there and take pictures through it. It's an excellent window for that kind of thing.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. I've got about three Flight Planning questions here on the completion of things.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. Has a second sextant calibration test been performed?
No, we haven't done that.
Roger, and -
I guess the first one didn't come out too well. I mean, I only got one star.
Roger. And how about the optics calibration test? Have two of those been performed?
Don't know what that is. You mean the COAS calibration?
No, that's the first part of P23. It's that trunnion bias check thing.
Oh, yes. No, I did that the same time I did the sextant calibration.
Roger. And how about the window photography as described in the DTO S-20.16?
I haven't taken any pictures. I think Walt and Wally have taken some along the way. I don't know if we did it exactly to that DTO, but I think we got most of it.
Roger. I understand. And - 7, Houston - opposite omni.

Thank you. And I have a block data to pass up. This is a fairly brief pass here at Carnarvon. I'll get you at Honeysuckle at 24 and require S-band volume up at that time.
Roger.
Bill.
Roger. Go.
Could you give me a map update, please?
Roger. Have one right here. For REV 146 GET 232 plus 28 plus 05, 116.8 west.

Block data: 147 dash 1 Bravo plus 263 minus 0630 232 plus 09 plus 47 4102, 148 dash 1 Alfa plus 299 minus 0645 233 plus 46 plus 42 3550, 149 dash 1 Alfa plus 293 minus 0644 235 plus 25 plus 39 3075, 150 dash 1 Alfa plus 237 minus 0630 237 plus 07 plus 05 2811, 151 dash 4 Alfa plus 294 minus 1615 239 plus 48 plus 35 3073, 152 dash 4 Alfa plus 298 minus 1615 241 plus 29 plus 11 2839. Standing by for readback.
Roger. Can you give me that last one over, please? The time.
Roger. 241 plus 29 plus 11.
Okay. 147 dash 1 Bravo plus 263 minus 0630 232 09 47 4102, 148 plus 299 minus 0645 233 46 42 3550, 149 plus 293 minus 0644 235 25 39 3075, 150 plus 237 minus 0630 237 07 05 2811, 151 plus 294 plus - minus 1615 239 48 35 3073, 152 plus 298 minus 1615 241 29 11 2839.
Readback is correct.

Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Antigua.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger.
I have a couple of things to discuss there, Donn, to put into the Flight Plan for Flight Plan update.
Oh, okay. Go ahead.
Right. First item: we propose to dump waste water at 236 plus 50 - excuse me, 235 plus 50. That will be at the end of a night pass, and this will allow plenty of time for the stuff to disperse before the next night pass. And also, we'll be timed to give us the proper quantity for reentry. Now at 235 plus 50, we'd like to dump to 40 percent waste quantity, and we would like to get pretty close to that number if possible because this is going to insure us of the right quantity remaining at time for reentry.
Okay.
So I gave you a wrong number there. I corrected it, but to make sure: at 235 plus 50, dump to 40 percent.
Roger. I've got it. At 235 plus 50, dump tape.
Also, second item for information, we're looking at north set stars, and the analysis now is favorable. We'll have the information soon, that is if the crew wants the information.
I see. We could use the north set stars if we had to do a real backup alignment.
Affirmative.
All right. We'll take them if you've got them.
Yes, Donn, that is correct. You could use them for a backup alignment. They will be visible longer, but the primary reason for looking those thing up was to have two stars that would be visible for a longer period of time for doing this test.
Oh, I see. You're saying you want to use two other stars for the test.
That's affirmative. We're proposing that - or at least, we're prepared to provide you with that information. Let me put it that way.
In coming in, are we going to end up with the same - in other words when we fly back to null on our GDC ball, that will be the same as when we bring it up for the burn?
Affirmative.
All right. Well, I don't care. It really doesn't make that much difference. We're trained on the south end stars.
Okay. Well, I had - we had understood there was some reason to be worried about those because they wouldn't be visible long enough. These two stars that we have will be Navi and Polaris, stars 3 and 5. And they should - they will be visible for a longer period of time. That is why they went to work and got this information.
Oh, I see.
They are still looking, trying to find out exactly what the periods are for the - that is the periods of visibility and then the duration of the time they will be visible.
Yes, that may not be a problem. Actually, if you gave us the pitch, roll, and yaw align, we can just put those numbers on the IMU ball, and that ought to put the south end of the right position.
Okay. The way I understood it was that because of the geometry of the orbit and the daylight problem, they would be visible for short periods. However, we'll just sort of hang loose on this for right now.
Well, Ron said that they would be visible about 12 minutes. Twelve minutes would be plenty if you've got them right in the telescope to start with.
Copy.
That may not be enough.
Okay. We'll stand by. We have that information available.
Good. I prefer to use the south end stars if we can, because we trained on that a little more, and we know what we're doing. I think.
Okay. Fine. Request opposite omni, please.
Okay.

Hey, Bill, I took a look at that south set star and those two stars, and you're right; they're not much good, but then the Cross went out of sight in about, oh, I guess 6 to 8 minutes.
Roger.
So I think we better go with the north side if we can get them.
Okay. I'll start working on it right now.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Go.
Right. On this procedure (page 33 on the checklist) - that's on this backup alignment - the two stars will be Navi, star number 3 instead of Acrux; and Polaris, number 5 instead of Atria.
Okay. Stand by, and I'll get that written down here.
Okay. And the procedure, of course, will remain the same.
Okay, Bill. I got it. The way it reads now - maneuver the stars Navi number 3 on the 50-degree mark and Polaris number 5 on the R line.
That's correct, and, of course, you have all the information written in there if we can go either way depending upon the situation. But since you made the change, we'll assume now that we are sending all of our information up the north set stars.
Right. I'd like to do that.
Okay. Apollo 7, Houston. you're GO for 164 dash 1.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston; One minute LOS Antigua; Canaries at 50.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Canaries. Standing by.
Roger, Bill.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Roger. I just got a fast alarm, and a fuel cell 3 light came on. However, all cockpit meter indications are indicating NORMAL.
Roger. We're looking.
Apollo 7. Houston.
Go.
Roger. We've been watching it for some time. The condenser exhaust temperature has been dropping down; there's nothing to worry about; it'll come back up as soon as you power up. Apparently, this has been a slow trend they've been monitoring from the ground.
Oh, I see now. Ours has dropped below the green bank; I've got 155 here.
155. Roger.
Okay. We'll use batteries and compute it as usual and figure it'll come back up when we power up.
That's affirmative. And you still have a fuel cell 3 light?
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. We have a number 3 that tends to run cool, and number 2 tends to run hot. Number 2 is carrying a little more load than the others that's on both bus. What do you people think of swapping; in other words, put three on both buses and two on 2 only?
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston. We're talking that over; we'll get it to you at Carnarvon.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Canary; Carnarvon at 25. We'd like to have P00 in ACCEPT for Carnarvon acquisition; we'll give you a state vector and a target load.
Righto. I'll have it.
Thank you.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. I have the maneuver PAD when you're ready to copy.
I'm ready. Go ahead.
Roger. SPS number 7, 239 06 1100 minus 00000 minus 01 000 minus 02020. Donn, could you go to ACCEPT, please?
You've got it.
Roger. Continuing to read with NOUN 22: 2303 plus 0901 02083 24647 minus 073 minus 131 008 05 2831 276 238 24 0000 minus 0942 plus 13557 2307; roll, pitch, and yaw all zeros. Standing by for readback.
Roger. I got the SPS burn number 7, 239 06 1100 minus all balls minus 01 000 minus 02020 2303 plus 0901 02083 24647 minus 073 minus 131 008 05 2831 276 238 24 0000 minus 0942 plus 13557 2307 all balls.
Right. You faded out. In NOUN 42 up there, for the apogee height, 2303.
Roger. 2303.
Okay. And comments: SCS AUTO with SPS, out of point north, pitched up 70 degrees. And also in the comments section, I have the backup align information.
Okay. Pitched up 70 degrees. Is that what you got?
Affirmative. Out of plane north, pitched up 70 degrees.
Right and heads up. That is a backup?
Affirmative. That's right. It is heads up.
Go ahead and give your backup angles now, Bill.
Right. For the backup alignment: roll 035, pitch 003, yaw 006. Comments: backup align stars are north set, both stars available after 5 minutes in darkness.
Okay. Roll 035, pitch 003, yaw 006, north set, 5 minutes after darkness.
Affirmative. Readback is correct.
I understand. These are the angles that when we're in position with the north set stars and we fly back to NULL on the GET, we'll also be at NULL on the INE pole.
That's affirmative. That's the way I understand it.
Okay. That ought to do it.
Donn, before you put your pad away, would you confirm in NOUN 42 the C - 020832?
Roger. 02083; got it.
Thank you. Readback is correct.
Okay. Thank you, Bill.
Okay. Donn, it's your computer.
Okay.
Both loads are in.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni, please.
Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up on Carnarvon LOS. S-band volume up at Honeysuckle which will be about a half minute from now.
Okay, Bill.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni, please.
Roger.
Go.
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Nothing, Bill. I was just responding to your call there.
I'm sorry.
No sweat.
Apollo 7. Houston. Approximately 1 minute LOS Honeysuckle; Guaymas at 04

Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go.
Hey, Donn, monitor your yaw. We show a slow drift over toward 270.
Roger. I'm keeping an eye on it.
Okay.
I'm hoping that the pitch and yaw so we don't quite get over there.
Okay. We'll keep an eye on it here; we have a long pass.
Okay.
Very good.
Okay. Took P52 using Rigel and Aldebaran. Oh, you guys are reading this, right?
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Antigua; Ascension - Canaries, rather, at 26.
Roger. Bill, we'd like to finish this fine align check.
All right.
Apollo 7, Houston through Canary. Standing by.
Roger.
Go ahead.
Apollo 7. Houston. We're monitoring about 75 degrees in yaw.
Roger. Thanks, Bill. I just caught it. I was hoping I could get away without firing the yaw, but I had to.
Roger.
Hey, Bill. We have lost downlink, and you didn't give the tape back that last time. I did the fine align check; I used Sirius and Rigel. I got five balls starting with Eperus, got plus four balls 8, plus three balls 24, minus four balls 3 for the torquing angles in the fine align check.
What were the last two on the fine align check?
Plus four balls 24 and minus four balls 3.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up on LOS; Tananarive at 46. and Carnarvon on the hour.
Roger. We'll see you then.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
Hello there.
Hello. Do you have a residual from your EMS DELTA-V test?
No, haven't done it yet, but I imagine it's 21.6 like it always is.
Okay. And, Donn, just for the record, did you get the canister change?
Negative. We'll get that.
Okay. No sweat.
Good morning, Bill.
Good morning.
Hey, this is Wally. I'd like you to have the surgeon give us some dope on Actifed. We're not sure whether my symptoms with it are right or not, but my mucous thickened up and tended to dry up a little bit. It got a lot thicker as a result of treating myself with Actifed. Does it dry up the nostrils and the sinus, or does it just sort of thicken it up?
Stand by. The surgeon is nodding his head and said that's a common response.
That it thickens the mucous?
It thickens it and also maybe dries up your nose.
How about your sinuses? Will it dry up your sinus?
It shrinks them down.
Does, eh?
Roger.
Well, let's make our point. We're about ready to start on Actifed about every 8 hours, right up to retro, and we're just not sure if it's a smart move or not.
It - as far as the surgeon is concerned, it's a recommended procedure.
Roger. We'll go that way.
Okay.
Hey, Bill.
Roger.
We've tried and tried since last night to find out how we're going to change canisters 22 times, when we only started with 22 canisters including the two in the lithium hydroxide canister.
Okay. I had originally designed that thing; I'll explain it to you later.
Well, for change number 21, we can put can number 1 back; but for 22, it leaves me cold.
Okay.
I think we'd better go back to the drawing boards for that one, Bill.
No comment.
Our point here, Bill, is maybe we had better not change this one now. If we just stretch these out - none of them have gone very far - we're less than about one-tenth of a millimeter right now. If we stretch this one out and move the next one back a little bit, we've got them through the flight, I think.
Roger. I see what you're saying. I agree.
What he's saying - in 101, we should at least try for a silly millimeter longer.
Oh, boy.
That's two for you.
Bill, I told you to get us a new writer.
Thought you were setting me up there the other night. I'm afraid to say anything anymore.
(Laughing) Yes.
Hey, Bill. Happiness is a package of bacon squares on day 10.
Roger. Sounds like you have quite a few useful comments on the food there; I've been reading the notes.
You ought to see what we've written.
How do they spell "blacch"?
Check with Sparkey Schultz, there.
We think you ought to look that one up in your Funk and Wagnalls.
We'll bridge the gap.
Apollo 7, Houston. LOS Carnarvon in 1 minute; S-band volume up at that time for Honeysuckle.
Okeydoke.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni, please.
Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni again, please.
Houston, did you call S-band?
Roger. Opposite omni.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up on Honeysuckle LOS; Hawaii at 29.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. Standing by.
Aloha.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Roger. Go.
Right. Just by way of a reminder, we'd like to remind you that when in DAP control, we'd like all channels ENABLED, and DAP loaded to fail quads Alfa and Bravo to save some fuel on these two quads.
I understand that about the DAP load. What did you say before the DAP load?
Just as a reminder.
Okay. If it was only the DAP load, we are aware. Thank you very much.
Right. Thank you.
It is our intention not to change - make canister change 22 in the Flight Plan until about 49 hours, unless CO2 partial pressure dictates otherwise.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Roger. You're coming in a lot better now. It's our intention not to make canister change number 22 as called out in the Flight Plan until about 40 hours.
Roger. Understand.
And that - unless CO2 partial pressure goes up, we'll make canister change number - I guess it's 23. We will make 21 at about 40 hours. We'll make canister change 22 at about 50 hours. And we will put canister number 1 back in - canister number 2 back in then.
Okay. I understand. That's okay.
We'll put the canister back in that we took out first, whatever it was.
Right. I understand what you're saying.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Roger. We're in the process of doing this backup alignment. I've got as far as getting the stars where they should be and aligning the GDC. We're now flying back to three zeros on the ball. Let's check our error against the IMU.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7. Houston.
I'd like to record a comment concerning the optics quality of the telescope.
Roger.
We focus very sharply on the reticle pattern and on stars and so forth in the center of the telescope. As you get out toward the edge of it, the fringe area, it gets a distortion, and you get some fuzziness; this makes it very difficult to pick up stars out on the edge of it. Reminds me of a cheap pair of binoculars that you might get at Sears on sale or something.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Are you - you're getting our DSKY on the downlink, are you?
Affirmative.
Okay. Those numbers you see are the errors in this procedure. Looks pretty good to me.
You can't argue with that.
Let's argue. To make the point a little plainer, the attitude set thumbwheels are also included in this summation of errors because all I did was set in nine balls to fly the GDC error needle to NULL. So the bias from that is also included.
I understand.
Roger.
Hey, Bill, do you have a map update for us? One that's on this rev, say?
Stand by. We have REV 149, time is 236 plus 58 plus 44. 173.9 degrees east.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston. Also like to remind you about the waste water dump scheduled at 235 plus 50.
Wilco.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
We show water dump down to 40 percent. I assume that 40 percent guarantees us we won't have to dump anymore before reentry. We can restow our attachment? Over.
Okay. That is using the figures they have been able to determine on the flight; that's correct.
And we'll end up with how much of the waste water tank then at 250 hours?
About 90 percent.
Okay.
You got a little...
We're going to restow this thing. This is going to be our last dump.
What if we go an extra 3 hours, what would happen?
Stand by.
We won't worry about that.
This is kind of academic; we're worried about a trickle flow through the urine dump, that's all.
Okay.
So we're not worried. We'll make this dump, and that's it.
All right.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
Through with downlink now. Do you show the cabin pressure holding steady? We've got an O2 FLOW HI on, and I think - it looks to me like the cabin pressure might be falling a little bit.
Cabin pressure's holding pretty constant here. I've been looking at it, but stand by.
Apollo 7, Houston. No, it still looks good here; you might check the waste vent and direct O2 valves.
Roger. We are dumping water.
Oh, yes. That's probably it. I'm reading about 46.8 percent now.
Roger.
Are you seeing rates down there, Bill?
I can see quantities; I'm getting readouts.
No, no maneuvering rates.
Looks like I just lost - I lost part of my display here, but I was watching then, yes.
We're building up to almost two-tenths of a degree in percent already in yaw since the dump.
Yes, I see it.
Okay. Let's take it out now.
One-tenth of a degree in the other two axes.
Roger.
Let's go to LOCK now. We don't want to go any farther. It's pretty fast to get...
two-tenths of a degree per second.
Okay. I'm making a comment.
Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up on LOS; Tananarive at 21.
Hello, Bill, did you read?
Negative.
Okay, on the water - waste water dump. I let the rate build up to almost 0.2 degree per second in VENT and corrected it back to the opposite direction to about 0.1 degree per second. It's now at 2.2 degrees per second back again. Report use considerable. The vent, of course, is causing the spacecraft to go to the right.
The last remark on the water vent - coupled with the perigee-torque phenomenon, so the two may be complementary, even if they are aligned out of plane at this time.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
Good morning, Donn.
Hi, Jack. How are you?
Fine.
Good.
Have a good weekend?
Good morning, Jack.
Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Tananarive; Carnarvon at 36.

Apollo 7, opposite omni.
Tell Ed I admire his astute judgement.
Roger.
Apollo 7, opposite omni.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. Wally, as we go over the hill here, we are looking at the primary evaporator; looks a little strange. If it dries out, you might shut it down and leave it shut down; we'll pick you up next time. We are about 45 seconds LOS here at Carnarvon. We do have Honeysuckle for another 4 minutes if you want to turn up S-band.
Wilco.
We'll go ahead and shut it down, Jack.
Okay. Does it look strange to you. Walt?
Yes. I'm going to shut it down.
Okay. We do not have Honeysuckle, so we'll pick you up at Hawaii at 02.
Wilco. 02.
Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead.
Roger.
Houston. Apollo 7.
Co ahead, 7.
Jack. I've got one more helpful hint to offer on this backup alignment.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. In order to prevent the optics from dripping off the shaft and trunnion angle, you set - merely turn optics power off when you get if set up, and they will stay right there.
Okay.
I think the point to make note of is that we are really tracing out what amounts to an optics shaft tie-up anyway. You could consider it just that way.
Okay. Copy that, Walt.
Hey. Jack, on the primary evaporator here, I went to MANUAL and increased for a minute, and it really didn't do much; then it started coming back up. I went to AUTO again, when I noticed the setting in here with the evaporator outlet temperature about midrange and the steam pressure in an acceptable spot. And I don't see either one of them moving at all now.
Okay. Copy that.
So I am going to start looking for a separate problem on that.
All right.
Apollo 7. Houston.
Go.
Okay. Wally, on the primary evaporator there, the pressures and temperatures look normal to us down here on the ground. We would like to shut the evaporator down at this time; and some time after the burn, we will reservice it again and then use it prior to entry.
Okay. You don't want to reservice it when I shut down?
Negative.
And what are you showing glycol EVAP OUT temperature?
44.1.
Yes. Well, when this is controlling, it controls down around 40.
Wally, it shouldn't be boiling now. You RAD OUT slow, and it's - you are mixing.
Understand.
If you will notice, Jack, I don't have manual control of the steam pressure valve.
You have gone to INCREASE now?
I went to INCREASE for about a minute and a half when I shut it out earlier, with no noticeable effect on the back pressure - the steam pressure. Subsequent to that time, it come up. When it got within a working range, I went back to AUTO. I just attempted to manipulate it again, with no noticeable effect on it. That's why I think there is something fishy with the back pressure control. It is secure now as much as I can secure it, and if we just let it sit here, it might end up drifting on up like it did before. I won't reservice it until some time before reentry then.
Okay. We will give you a cue.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead. Go ahead, Wally.
Roger. We are starting with ALC out; we are dark in here with floods on. Is that correct?
For even light, if you are going to show pictures of the panel or something like that, you should put ALC in. For spot effects, then ALC should be out.
We have got floods around us here that are pretty bright. We will try out first, all right?
Okay. That is fine, and if it does not look like a real good picture, I'll tell you to change the position of the switch.
Very good.
Have you got a spectacular for us this morning?
Negative.
Okay.
We are just going to be at our duty stations.
All right.
Okay. We are just starting to pick it up, Wally. The picture is not real clear yet. Okay. There, it's coming in. From the lovely Apollo room high atop everything - you might try a different position on the ALC switch. Let's see how that helps.
How is that, Jack?
Okay. Let's go back to the other position; I think you were right. Everybody out of the pool.
This morning, we are at our regular crew stations passing over the United States about an hour and a half before our seventh and final burn, before our eighth burn tomorrow morning on retro fire. Donn Eisele is down in the lower equipment bay on a backup alignment technique. We had the platform aligned at this point before burn number 7. I don't know whether you can note or not, Jack, but I'm moving from the front of the attitude indicator down below up to the window, getting ready to check for dawn. It should be arriving just any moment now. I think you can the ease in motion. None of us are strapped in; we feel very comfortable where we are.
Roger. It's coming in very clear.
Roger. We thought we would try to give each of you a closer look at our beards this morning, to prove that we have been here, and we are not funs of the beard club. I will not admit to the fact that there is any grey in this beard. My hairdresser is the only one that knows.
Roger. We can't see the grey; you're safe.
Roger. I was wondering where the grey went. Well, I'm going down below now and let Donn get up on the couch; you can check his beard and his configuration for the day.
Hey, Donn, you want to move over to your - oh, that's it.
Wally's going to move the camera a little bit. You have three professional cameramen up here now; so when we get back, we expect to get our union cards. I was performing a backup alignment procedure that could be used in the event of a computer failure to get the inertial platform aligned for a particular maneuver. That has been completed now. That was one of our test objectives on this flight, and it came out very good. We came within a quarter of a degree of the actual alignment that we wanted. Wally and I have been taking turns watching the eight balls over here keeping the spacecraft somewhere near the attitude we need for the burn, and a little later on we will bring it in precisely. Our number 1 cameraman, is now coming down to dolly up on Walt Cunningham and his beard.
Wally, there appears to be a few pieces of lint an the lens. Thank you.
Now, we would like to give you another demonstration. that we've noticed right about this time is the little bit of atmospheric pressure causing the spacecraft to move at this altitude, as we near the perigee, and that's what Donn's looking at on the dial right now., Walt, why don't you tell them where you are now, and point the camera over your head.
Okay. We are just about, due for an O2 purge. Because of the time, I'm going to go ahead and start the O2 purge in fuel cell 1. We have three fuel cells that have been running very nicely for 11 days. I've got a camera sticking in the window here, a 16mm Maurer camera, which we have been taking strip photographs for the ground at various times, and we are presently going to stow that. We're trying to get the cockpit clean for the burn, which is due here in a couple of hours.
We keep behind our couch here, a large bag which we call a temporary stowage bag. In order to preclude having to take items all the way down to where we originally got them, during the flight, we drop them in the temporary stowage bag, such as your meals, and like the camera was just done now.
A rather interesting phenomena we're noting out the window, it's light now. It's very hard to tell on camera in that the details are very fine. We see about three or four different contrails from aircraft flying at high altitude, but obviously not as high as we. They show up very neatly, some people call contrails, vapor tail; they extend for hundreds of miles.
I remember the one we saw, was it yesterday or the day before, over Africa, Wally.
Right. Now, we've got an interesting one below us over the Gulf Coast.
And as you look out the window towards the horizon, you can get a good view of the day airglow. There is a very interesting band of color that runs between the actual earth surface and up where the dark blue or black of the sky begins. It's a very pretty, very toned blue color.
I'm now going to pan bank one last time across the cockpit here, and I guess this will end our weekly series with this broadcast. There is our navigator.
Navigator here.
The view this morning is very fascinating; we're looking all over the Gulf Coast area and looking now at Lake Ponchartrain. We can see the bridge standing out very clearly. There's a slight cyclonic disturbance in the cloud structure, which is probably the very bitter end of our friend Gladys. I hope our friends in Florida where we left some time ago, have not suffered too much with Gladys.
We have one more sign for you to close out our weekly series, and we plan to drop in tomorrow and see how everybody held out.
Could you move it a little closer? Let's see, Donn, you want to help him out there. "As the Sun sinks slowly in the west.
This is Apollo 7, cutting out now.
A very good one, Wally.
Time for a commercial.
We got a good look at the last bit of Gladys just off the coast.
Roger.
Looks like it still might be dumping a little rain in the Cape.
On - Glays is - looks like -. About north of Jacks -.
Isn't it just about off the coast of Jacksonville!
No, Wally, Gladys is up around 40, 40 degrees north.
0h, it is, We're seeing the tail end of it, I'm sure.
Well, it looks like about, 67 degrees west, and 40 degres north. That was the position at 0400 Zebra this morning.
Roger. How is the weather in 164 dash one area?
Weather is real good there.
Well, I think we are just about getting warmed up to the. In that case, I've got a feeling today that when we come over 164-1 - our splash point that is - that we won't use the word impact.
Okay, Wally, I'll give you a kind of a hack when you pass close to us here, so you can take a look at it.
Roger. Are we working it now, or is it the next rev?
No, the next rev. It will be way north of you. In just a few minutes, I'll give you a hack and it will be slightly north of you, of your present position.
Okay. We'll try and give you a weather report.
I'm not really worried too much about the weather, as long as the ocean is nice and smooth.
Understand.
What we are facing up to is this is a great spacecraft, but we know it's a lousy boat.
Okay. Wally, you are about 65 degrees west now, and your latitude looks like about 24 degrees north, and so that would put 164 dash 1 about 240 miles north of you now.
Roger. Walt will give you a report, he's looking that way.
As near as I can see, there is nothing but very widely scattered cumulus to the left for one tenth coverage that way.
Thank you.
Do those signs come through fairly, clear to you, Jack?
They do when you get close to the camera; it was pretty clear today.
What did you think of those beards?
Well, they are there. We can't tell whether they are 3 inches long or a half inch long.
I'd say about 101 mm.
Hey, Jack, note that the steam pressure is very slowly creeping up here, and that's long after I quit operating it. We may have a sticky, valve back there.
Okay. It looks fairly normal to us. It looks like it might have been a little bit dry.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead. 7.
Roger. One of the interesting things we've noted; I don't think we have brought it to your attention here. If you recall going to a monkey cage and watching monkeys grab bars, the monkeys always grab the same place. We found ourselves in the same condition here; using our hands and feet to maneuver about, and we always hit the same traffic spot.
Roger.
We've become very acclimated to this.
I think he's trying to tell you we've gone ape.
I think we guessed that.
We're getting to the point where we get free rides with this perigee kick, we're just about attitude again. It's going to be kind of tight in this burn; it is right at perigee and out of plane.
Yes, that's right, Wally.
I think that is probably the biggest surprise in the whole mission was the effects of this perigee torque. If you buck it, it can cost you dearly in fuel.
I guess it's kind of like the old aileron roll on the 86.
Very good. It's about that kind of surprise, too.
7, could we get your up-telemetry COMMAND RESET then NORMAL?
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. Standing by.
Roger. Copy. We're standing by.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead, 7.
Roger. What's the sunset time?
Donn, the next one coming up is 238 plus 12.
All right. Thank you.
Apollo 7, you're 1 minute LOS Ascension; Tananarive in 57.
Roger.
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Roger. Jack, fuel cell 2 seems to be a little more temperamental today than it has been in the last 3 or 4 days. We're going a little faster and a little higher. Dose the trend indicate that for the next hour and 6 minutes, we will state our activity.
Okay. Walt, you're about three-by here at Tananarive. Copy fuel cell 2 being a little more temperamental today than previously.
Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
Roger. Loud and clear.
You, also.
Apollo 7, we are about 1 minute LOS Carnarvon; we'll pick up Guam at 25.
Roger. Jack, on our EMS bias test for the 30-second count into the burn, and the duration of the burn it went 0.1 foot per second.
Roger. Copy that.
A pretty good DELTA-V. I wish the upper half were like that.
Seems that way.
You look in your lens?
Apollo 7, Houston through Guam.
Roger. Loud mad clear here.
Loud and clear.
Jack, would you reconfirm our DELTA-V as 208 feet per second? The reason I ask, the DSKY came up with a total velocity of 225, and that's quite a difference.
Roger. We have 208.3 on the DELTA-V counter.
Roger. I got that. I just wanted to make sure I was right.
Do you have to downlink, Jack?
Affirmative, Walt.
Donn, we are allowing about 17 feet a second for tail-off here on this burn.
I see; we are getting more than I thought we would.
Roger. That was a change we made into the tail-off into the computer.
Yes.
7, we are I minute LOS Guam; we pick up Hawaii at 38.
Downlink yet?
Negative; we have lost downlink; we'll get it again at Hawaii.
Star check: that's 283.14, 276.99 is the shaft and trunnion to be right on the star.
Okay.
Could you say again the trunnion, Donn?
Trunnion 276.99.

Go ahead.
Roger. We'd like your O2 tank 1 fans OFF now to prevent an AUTO cycling during this burn.
It's OFF.

Okay, Jack.
Five, four, three, two, one.

Hey. Jack.
Houston, Apollo 7.
Go ahead.
Did you get us au RCS quantity readout as of this minute?
Okay. Donn, I am going to be coming to you over Ascension with the chart readout as well as the Flight Plan update.
Roger. Understand.
Hey, Jack, I would like to go ahead and open circuit fuel cell 2 and save it for the burn tomorrow.
We show that TCE is coming down now, Wally. We are reading 190.
I show 192. It peaked out at what, about 195?
No, we showed 192 on the TM here.
That's just before the burn. Looked like it was about 195 on my meter, dud you want to go ahead and let it run with this?
Yes, we will let it run right now. We will see you over at Ascension. We've got about 1 minute LOS here.
Okay.
We will pick you up at 17 at Ascension. We will have a Flight Plan update for you there.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
Loud and clear, Jack.
Okay. That burn looked pretty good down here; how did it go up there?
Right on the mark. It's a beauty.
It looked the same way down here. I have this Flight Plan update to go over with you.
Okay. We will discuss it.
Okay. Are you ready to copy this material in the book here? They're mostly deletions.
Will copy.
Okay. They are mostly deletions here. We still want you to do the PIPA bias EMS bias test which is scheduled at 239:50.
You say cancel that?
No, negative. We still want you to do that one.
We did it before the burn, which is much more significant. It's already done.
We didn't do the PIPA bias yet.
Oh, you want the PIPA bias?
Roger.
Okay. The EME bias is complete.
Okay. And at 240, you'll have that canister change which you have already been given; you want to delete the sextant calibration test. Okay. I'll be passing you up a state vector and a NAV check along with the landing block data number 26; I'll be sending you a state vector, and I'll be giving you the NAV check.
Roger.
Okay. At 240:30, we'll initiate a charge on batt B. We want to charge batt B, the lowest battery, to verify their repeatability of the lower than expected battery charging performance that we have observed. They have run some chamber tests out at Downey to duplicate this charging, and we have concluded that it's a safe and useful thing to do, which will give us some added electrical capacity. But even without battery B, we've got sufficient electrical capacity for any kind of entry and stay time on the water.
What kind of stay time?
18 hours.
Eighteen?
Well, we got more than -
substract from about 30 hours; that's more than 48.
Okay. It's 18 with the hybrid reentry, Wally, but we have got way more than that.
Okay.
And coming into - and everything else that I don't mention stays the same - you still have the photography, and at 241, we'll power -
We are cancelling out H2 heaters and purge?
Roger. Yes, that's all done; we picked that up a little later. H2 heaters and the purge are cancelled, the G&N power down at 241. And -
241?
Yes, 241 plus 00.
G&N and SCS, right?
Right.
Okay. What I need, and you might do that now, is get the fUel reading.
Okay. I've got that for you.
And if we have the fuel, I'd like to read the SCS up for awhile and use that fuel for photography and pulse mode.
Okay. Your RCS chart value is 496 pounds.
Okay. It looks - let's use some of that fuel today; we can't use much of it tomorrow.
Okay. Wally, stand by on that value here; I'll be giving you an updated one here. Let's go ahead and finish this Flight Plan update.
Okay.
At 241:10, we want to delete the P23 trunnion bias check.
Roger.
And at 242, then you'll delete that power down?
Okay. We can power down the G&N.
Yes, power down to G&N.
Okay. We'll leave the SCS up for now.
Okay. For that, you'll have your power down at 241, and then we are just deleing the power down at 242. We're just powering you down an hour earlier.
You still have the window photography, at 24 -
Okay.
You still have the window photography at 242:30, over the chlorination - okay, over 244, we want to delete the cryogenic stratification test.
CRYO out at 243. Do you want more chlorine in?
Roger. The chlorination still stands.
Okay. We are just about right on that, so I think it would be just about right to run it every other day.
Okay, fine.
okay. Coming on that next page of 244, you'll delete the stratification test.
Roger.
Everything else on that page stays the same; there is an addition at 245:40. That's the H2 line heaters on; and at 246, an H2 fuel cell purge; and you will be deleting the canister change at 247; and you are picking that up at 250. And the remainder of the Flight Plan looks pretty good, Wally.
Okay. I'd like to start stowing the cockpit today, and I'd like to drop that humidity survey; we filled in the block on that anyway.
Okay, we'll - and -
We'll do the humidity survey at 245:20.
Okay. We'll let you know on that over Tananarive. Your chart value updated is 503, and the doctors have come up with a recommended Actifed schedule to give you the maximum crew comfort on reentry. They are recommending each crewman take one tablet at 241, another tablet at 249, and a third one at 257, and this is, the 257 one, is the most important.
Okay. Got that. Jack, broadcast in the blind at Tananarive if we don't answer.
Okay. Will do, Wally.
Okay.
We are just about to lose you; Tananarive at 32.
Jack, has the O2 been deleted for the rest of the mission?
Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
Roger. All and clear, Jack.
Okay. You're about four-by.
Well, very good.
Jack, our CO2 is reading quite low, less than one tenth of a mm of mercury. I would ride a little bit more there. It seems to be a very normal gage.
Okay. Wally, we are going to have to wait until Carnarvon to get it; we've got an 8 minute pass at Carnarvon. I got something about a tenth of a mm, but I didn't quite copy all.
Say again.
Let's wait till Carnarvon to get your last transmission. We pick up Carnarvon at 48.
Okay. There is another question.
No, Wally, we don't have any other information for you. We'll see you at Carnarwon.
Roger. Standing by.
Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
Roger. Loud and clear, Jack.
Roger. Loud and -
Jack, I think what you heard me say is that we would like to check our fuel budget and use the SPS for about two revs or more, depending on how the fuel goes, to get some photography to finish up our films.
Okay. Wally, I'll be coming to you with some DAP redline values and some recommendations on that.
We'll have to do it right away, unless we're down that low. That will be all right; we'll use SPS to come down on the DAP redline. That sounds good.
Okay.
We buy the SPS, obviously.
You're sure looking good.
Jack, on that canister change at 240 even, we've got pretty good canisters in there now. We're less than 1 mm of CO2. I think I would like to let this known canister run along to about 3 mm in CO2 and then go ahead and change it out and put back in the - our last brand new one, and then we won't have to count very much on the one that was in there at launch.
Okay. Walt, let us get back to you on that.
Okay. Walt, on your proposal there on the canister changes, we concur.
Thank you.
Okay. Wally, you might be interested that your orbit we're tracking is now 90.0 by 231.1.
Roger.
Do you know what we read onboard? 230.9 by 90.0. I think.
Yes, I copied that. I wrote that down.
Do you read 231 even as what you are painting?
Negative, 231.1.
Sorry, you are off by.2 miles.
I'll tell FIDO.
Tell him to watch out, with all of this high calorie food, we may be as big as he is; we don't know yet.
Roger. Copy that.
So far, unless he's gone over 200, though he has improved since that last simulation.
Roger.
Jack, you might send a call to the Pollution Control Board and have them check that smoke off Galveston. It looks terrible today.
Okay. Copy that, Wally.
Okay. Wally, I've got some recommendations for RCS fuel here.
Go ahead.
Okay. A and D are your best quads. B and C are above the DAP redline, not uncomfortably now, but I recommend that you be very sparing when you use quads Baker and Charlie. And so when you are maneuvering don't use more than 5 pounds of RCS fuel for this - your picture-taking.
Roger. That's just about all we need.
Okay, fine; and we're recommending B and D roll.
B and D roll. Roger.
Jack, are you getting this PIPA bias numbers in downlink?
If you will just wait a minute, Wally, we'll catch you. Okay. We're getting them now.
Would you like me to read you the results, or have you got my results off the DSKY?
Roger. We'll copy that now, Donn. Just give us a few seconds here, and we will have it all down.
Okay.
By the way, on the schedule for the Actifed, we looked at our schedule for the flight about 3 days ago and Dr. Walt Cunningham, mostly, finalized it, and there was one minor anomaly in the whole schedule.
Okay.
So the doctors are doing pretty well down there.
Okay. Donn, would you read out PIPA bias; I guess we lost it. We lost the data.
Okay. Jack, the PIPA bias I got was X plus 0.09, Y is 0, Z plus 0.08. The bias compensation as presently loaded: it's plus 10504 plus 0 plus 0.07440. So they are all very close to axis.
Okay. Copy that.
Jack, unless I don't understand this EMS, what I do to EMS bias is run it in DELTA-V and AUTO for the 30 seconds prior to the burn and the duration of the burn. That's all I am ever going to do in flight anyway. If somebody has some better ideas, I'll do it.
Okay...
After all, that's all you use it for.
Okay. We copy that.
Okay. We are about to lose you over Carnarvon; we'll pick you up at Guan on the hour.
Roger. I'm going to coarse align and plane enroute.
