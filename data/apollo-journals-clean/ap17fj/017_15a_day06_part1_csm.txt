Hello, America; Houston. Standing by.
Hey, Houston; America. Man, you wouldn't believe it. I finally got my suit on.
I'm checking it off here. Right now I'm at 108:10. I'm - haven't - changed the canister yet. Let me check and see if I can have time to do that or not.
Okay, I'm VOX. Do you hear me now?
Okay. I'm Simplex Alpha and VHF, Right. Now, we're B. Okay. We're Antenna Right, plex B.
Okay. I don't read you at all, Jack.
Okay. I'm down to Simplex Bravo.
Yeah; go ahead.
I'm talking on B now. How do you read?
No, I don't read you at all either, Jack.
No, I don't read you!
Okay. I've got everything on in my Auto panel. Let me try the other one for backup.
Yep, I'm on Left. I'm on Left? Let me go to Backup.
I don't have you, yet.
Okay.
Hey, I finally got you!
Okay. You were kind of clipping there for a little bit. I got the last part of your transmission.
Okay. I heard that it was just - I missed the just - It was just warming up, but I got the loud and clear.
Okay. I read you loud and clear; that's VHF B.
Yeah, I didn't hear you at all that time.
Yeah, you're still clipping. All I got was "now."
Okay. "How do you read now?" I got that.
Then I missed that part of it.
Okay. Loud and clear, Gene.
Now, you're still clipping, Jack. Can you move your mike a little bit closer or something?
No, I didn't read you at all that time.
Not clear.
Well, you're going to have to yell or something. I still - you're still clipping yourself out, Jack.
No, I didn't read you that time.
Okay. Okay; switching to Alpha.
Bravo is Off; Simplex Alpha is On.
Don't read you.
Don't read you.
Okay. I don't read you guys at all, except through the tunnel.
Okay. Got you loud and clear that time. And, Gene, can you verify the capture latches are all engaged?
I didn't read you at all, Jack.
Didn't read you.
Okay. I got you that time, and check the capture latches.
Okay?
Yeah, I'm up in the tunnel, but go ahead.
Okay. I read you. Go ahead.
Okay. I'm getting the probe umbilicals installed now.
Okay, Gene. Can you look at the capture latches? I've got it preloaded here now.
Okay. Preload the - it's pushing on by, so I'll going to - preloaded.
Okay.
What do you mean; probe locked?
Yeah, it was locked. Oh, the drogue. Yeah, Yeah. Yeah, it's locked in there.
Min Deadband, Att Hold. Okay. I got that right now. Wait a minute; I don't have SCS. Let me give you SCS.
Okay. There we go. Plus 356.95, plus 106.34, and a plus 001.49.
Right?
America, Houston.
Okay, Houston; America. 0105 and 0, correct?
Yes, sir.
That's interesting. I don't know how it got off attitude.
Yeah, I was going to ask you the same thing. You might have knocked a - a stick or something while everybody was flailing around down there. Could you...
Maybe - maybe I hit the stick or something. Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, Gene. We're Min Deadband, Att Hold at 0105 and 0.
Okay; Verb 6, Noun 20: 000.32, 104.40, 359.55.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. I forgot to release the docking latches. Okay. I'll go up and release docking latches 1 and 7.
Okay.
And if I just put the - No, I'll do that.
I was going to say you could read the probe temp if I put the circuit breakers in.
Okay. There's number 1. One releases; two releases, and it's free...
Seven.
One release, two releases, and it's free.
Okay. Docking Probe circuit breakers; two of them are going Close. Main A. Main B. Probe Extend/Release is going to Retract. Ah ha, I've got two barber poles!
That's a good sign.
Okay. Docking probe circuit breakers are going Open. Okay. Extend/Releases, and they went gray, of course, when then went open. Okay. Extend/Release to Off. Verify probe extend latch engage indicator's not visible. Well, I'll go back - it wasn't a while ago, but I'll go look again. Only if you hit Extend with the circuit breakers in. Mighty fine. It's still back inside there. Extend latch is still engaged.
Okay. Standing by. Go ahead.
Okay. 000.44, 104.63, 359.69.
America, Houston, in order to get on and stay on the time line, I'll remind you about the lithium canister after PDI; we can let that one go. And if you'd like to let the camera business slide until after your suit check and we'll get those things. I'll come back and remind you of those, too.
Okay. I've got the - the cameras all set. I got them out, anyhow. I don't have the - the right values on the lenses yet; but, anyhow, the camera are out and they're loaded.
Okay.
I've got mag OO on the Hasselblad.
Okay, Houston. Why don't I go ahead and get the PGA ver out of the way, and then we can get some of the - data, or would you rather get the data up first?
No, it's your choice. Why don't we go ahead and get the PGA, and I'll just sit on these PADs, and could you tell me if you ever got around to playing with the squelch on the VHF?
Well, I did. And, let's see, we're at Squelch A now. I've even got it all the way down to 1, and I still don't hear them.
Okay. You did get a satisfactory check on your side, didn't you?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
I got a satisfactory - Every once in a while I can hear them now; they're cutting in and out somewhere, I don't know where.
All righty.
Okay. Squelch A is sitting at about 4.
And, America, we'll give you a state vector if you give us Accept.
Okay. You have it.
Thank you.
Houston, America. How much time to AOS, yet - LOS?
Oh, about 29 minutes.
Oh, okay. Got a little time for the PGA ver then, I guess.
And it's your computer, anytime you want to get to it, Ron.
Okay.
Ah ha, I got the old helmet and gloves on!
More cables all over the place here than I know what to do with.
Well, this place looks like a pigpen - you've run the same course everyone else has, I guess.
I got cables and hoses and...
Son-of-a-muck - I hit the stick again. Now I got to unlock it.
Okay. You want me to maneuver back to attitude, Gene?
We're out of attitude just a little bit.
Well I'm Min Deadband, but I maneuvered out of attitude. You want to go back to regular attitude?
Okay, Houston. flow return is Closed. Suit Flow valve. The other two are closed; mine is open, and I got the inner connect in between the other ones.
Sounds good.
How's the old suit pressure? Okay. Looks like pretty good. Okay. O2 flow is lower limit. Okay. Let's go up to Press. Here we go. That's going up to Press, and it feels like it's going up.
And terminal Direct O2 on air to O2 Flow High.
Okay. Wait a minute, Jack. I'll just go to Receive on the VHF. I'll just go to Receive on the VHF, Jack.
Okay. Let's see, and there's a Delta-P of about - 6½ - Now we're going to cycle suit circuit return here. Okay. It's out; it's back in. Okay. Now we can squirt a little more O2 flow in.
Whoo hoo! - There we go. Man, oh man!
Direct O2 is Off.
That's coming down. Shoot! I'm reading 4.5 in my suit. Is that right?
5.
Looks like about 4 on our data, Ron.
Well, I'll be darned. The old suit gauge read 4.5.
that close in there. Let's say about maybe nine or something like that. That's closer to four. Can't tell for sure what it feels like. Anyhow, the O2 flow is down. It's not leaking very much. I'm reading about a 0.3. Something like that.
Okay. We're - we're showing 4.2 to 4.3 on our pressure spread, and you're cabin and suit pressure gauges probably show something similar. And we show that the flow rate is down.
Oh, okay. That's not too bad. That's pretty close.
Yeah. And the O2 flow is staying pretty good.
let's go to Depress on this thing, huh?
Sounds good.
Okay; so it looks like it's sta - stable there, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
Okay. Let's go to Depress.
And my ears are pretty good. If you guys are okay I'm going to go to Off. Save a little time here.
America, I don't know if I copied you correctly. You don't want to go to Off on that Suit Test valve until the pressures are back down to normal. If that was what you asked.
Or are you already there?
I changed my mind.
Yeah. My ears are popping to meet demand - I changed my mind, I'll let it go down slowly.
Okay.
Okay. And we've got about 20 minutes before LOS, so there's no hurry on those PADs. I've got them standing by when you're ready, and didn't know what you - what you had in mind about working on these things. We might get - you might get started on the hatch integrity check, if you get to that point, and I can give you the PADs while you're waiting for it to bleed down or whatever it turns out to be convenient.
Okay. Let's see, I guess it's about time to - Integrity check; okay.
Okay. And I guess the LM is going to be asking you for a Noun 20 pretty soon like, here.
Okay, Challenger; America here. I'll go back to CMC.
Stand by. Okay, go.
Okay; 002.15, 104.36, 359.69.
And Houston, do we want to release those docking latches before they do their hot fire? I don't think so. Do we?
I'll check. Stand by.
You're right, Ron, we'll - we'll just hold up on that release on the latches until the hot fires are over. So, when you get your copying hand ready, why, we'll give you some PADs. We'll clean that one up.
Okay. Let's see.
Reading 2 SCS. Integrity check - Okay, it didn't...
Okay, Houston. Let's see - where are we going to start on the PADs?
Okay. And you might go to Block on the computer, too.
Okay.
Okay. The first thing I'll give you is the Sep PAD.
Okay. Let's go.
And that is on page 113.
Okay.
Okay. Noun 33 is 110:27:55.00. Roll is 0, 105 pitch, and yaw is 0.
Okay. Noun 33, 110:27:55.00, and roll, pitch, and yaw are as depicted: 0, 105, and 0. Right?
That's affirm.
Okay; got it.
Okay. The next thing I have for you is a P24 PAD that goes on page 115.
Okay. Suit Test valves in Off now. On page 115 - Okay; got it.
Okay. It'll be 17-1; 110:58:13; T-2 is 111:00:30; 01:00; 01:...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hold it, Ge - hold it. Okay, Wide Deadband Att/Hold, that's what I'm on. And Amer - Houston; America, I missed T-2 on.
Okay. Are you ready to go back to it now?
Okay; ready for T-2.
All right, sir T-2: 111:00:30; 01:...
Shoot!
00; 01:26; Roll 015, 297, 000; North 02. Over.
Okay. I'll read back what I have. T-1 110:58:13. I missed T-2. TCA is 01:00; T-3 is 01:26; Roll 15, pitch 297, and 0; North 02. I presume 17.1.
Yes, sir. And T-2 time is 111:00:30.
Okay. 111:00:30.
That's correct.
Challenger said something every time you talked on that one.
Hey, Jack, could you go to Receive only on the VHF for a little bit?
Okay.
And, Houston; America. You can go ahead on the next PAD.
Okay. On page 113, I've got a DAP load for you.
Okay.
Okay. The weight: 37983; plus 0.40, plus 0.91.
Okay, CSM weight is 37983; pak to off, plus 0.40; yak to off, plus 0.91.
Okay. That's correct. And the last one comes up on page 121, and it's a LM P76.
Ah ha; okay.
Okay, Noun 33.
Okay, 121 - Got it.
All right, sir. 112:02:51.92; minus...
Okay. Wait a min - Hold it. America, Challenger. The hot fire - you want Free, Challenger?
Challenger, America. You want Free for the hot fire?
Okay. Going to Free now.
And, Houston; America. You can try that one again.
All righty. Noun 33 is 112:02:51.92; minus 0007.5 and all zips for Y and Z.
Okay, try that Noun 33 again.
Houston, America. We're cut out on Noun 33 again, and I've got minus 0007.5 and X, Y, and Z are 0.
Okay. And the time, 112:02:51.92.
Okay, Noun 33 is 112:02:51 - 112:02:51.92.
That's correct.
Okay, Challenger; America. You're in Att hold. You didn't get very far off that time, either. That's good. Okay.
Okay.
Okay, Challenger; America.
Okay. I'm going to turn off B3 and also my roll jets, and then I'm going to undo the docking latches.
That's - verified Transponder is Off.
Say again about umbilicals.
All I get is umbilicals. I didn't get the question.
Verify. I have those down here.
And jet Bravo 3 is Off.
Okay, Ron, we're about 5 minutes from LOS. And the only thing that you wouldn't be able to do following right down your checklist is to get the VHF data on and check the tape recorder at LOS. The rest of that stuff you can follow right on through, and we'll remind you on the lithium change after descent. So it looks like we're caught up again.
And, America; Houston.
Okay. Number 1 is disconnected; and, Houston, could you watch my O2 flow - as I disconnect these things?
Okay, number 5. One, two - and it's fully released, and the hook is off of the docking ring. Okay. Number 6 is - one, two - and it's fully released, and the hook is off of the docking ring. Okay, 7 is released, and the hook is off of the docking ring. O2 flow still okay?
Yes, sir. Looking good.
Okay, here's number 8. Here's one, two. And the chute's fully released, and the hook is off the docking ring.
Okay, here's number 9. One, two, and she's fully released; the hook clears the docking ring. Okay, number 10. Here's one, two - fully released, and the hook clears the docking ring. There's one, 11. Okay, handle's free; J-hook clears the ring. I've only got one more to go. There's the first latch there's two latches came over. And the hook stays clear; the handle is free. And, by golly, they're all off. Hey, Challenger; America. You're hanging on those three little bitty things.
Okay. I put the old - hatch in.
Okay, Ron, we're within a minute of LOS. Your O2 flow still looks good, and the rest of the stuff that you can get on the VHF is going to be just fine. You're right on schedule now.
Okay. I'll get that VHF stuff and then put the hatch in.
Okay, we're in Receive Only to B Data.
Hey, Challenger; America.
