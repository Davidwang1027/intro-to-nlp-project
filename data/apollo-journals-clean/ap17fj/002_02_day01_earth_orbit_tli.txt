Houston, can you confirm - Main Bus Tie A/C, Off?
Stand by on that, Jack.
I've been carrying very low amps on the Bat Bus, and I did not see a drop. I'm carrying about 2 amps now. Volts are 3 - 30.5. [Long pause.]
Jack, go ahead and take the B/C motor switch Off. [Pause]
Okay. It's Off. And I confirm that one.
And we think it's the EDS Power switch and the fuel cell [garble] switch that are drawing the current that you're seeing there.
Okay. That could well be.
Okay, Jack, we're going to lose you in about 1 minute off of Vanguard here and see you at 52:20.
Roger; we're pressing. Thanks, Bob.
Okay, Bob. Everything is looking Go onboard. Everything's stable. We can see the APS firing, and our attitudes look good.
Geno, everything's in good shape down here. The booster's in good shape; you're looking good; and their AOS time is 52:20 as I gave you.
We got that, babe. We'll see you coming around.
Good show, babe. A little late but a good show.
Outstanding ride. [Long pause.]
EMS Function, Off.
Okay, it's Off.
Trans Control Power is Off.
Okay, Rate 2.
CM RCS Logic is Off.
Launch Vehicle Stage switch, Off, verify.
Okay. Yes, sir. It is Off.
They're locked.
Normal and latched.
Okay, I'm going to have to loosen up here and get at that.
17, Houston. We're hanging with you here. Looks like you're hanging in Vanguard a little longer than we expected.
Okay. And install the COAS.
O2 High Flow.
Okay. Let me get Repress Package valve, Off. Look at those aps - that amplifier.
Okay, and Suit Circuit Return Valve.
Hmm. Well, you got to...
Three of them right in here.
Let me know when you're ready for checklist stuff.
Boy, I tell you, I'm sure glad I didn't have to use any SPS stars out there. I never would have seen them. Look at that. Okay, here you go. Your first sight. You're looking to watch the sunrise. Jack, get out here.
There's some lightning out there. See it?
Yes, sir. What have you got 16 54 on there for, anything?
What time is it? Twenty-two. Yes, we're that much early.
Oh, it's just orange! You know. It starts out orange and then gets - becomes bright, and now it looks like a [garble]...
Okay. Four Heaters to Primary - l, 2, 3, 4. They are Primary.
180 degrees. GN2 valve Handle to Vent.
I don't know. I haven't done it yet [laughter].
I want you to pull it to Vent.
You're over the Atlantic, guys, looking out your window.
Okay. You want this reset?
I have the Optics Power, On.
G&N Power is On.
They're all gray.
Optics, Zero to Off, and then Zero
They're eight gray.
Optics, Zero...
Okay. Helium Tanks Temp, and...
Optics Mode to Manual.
Optics Coupling is Direct.
Okay, all the quads are Go.
Speed is High.
They're all nominal.
Okay, Command Module. They're both nominal.
There it is.
Drinking Water Supply valve, On.
COAS Tunnel A and B is Closed.
Okay, I'm going to Secondary.
Mark it. It's Normal.
Ten more seconds, Gene.
Okay, you can go to the Bypass.
Okay, it's back to Bypass.
Glycol Reservoir Bypass is Open.
Out is Closed.
In is Closed.
Well, I don't know whether I meant it or not, but it looked like it was On.
Mark it.
Okay, it's Off.
"As you set forth on the final Apollo expedition to the Moon, I want to have my personal best wishes for a successful mission and safe return. I am sure your voyage of scientific exploration will be the crowning achievement in a program which has expanded Man's horizons, brought great credit to your country and lifted the spirits of people all over the world. Godspeed to you all." Signed Richard Nixon. The Flight Dynamics Officer, continuing to process tracking data following orbital insertion, reports that there is a small amount of out of plane error showing up in the orbit. This it is believed is due to a small error in the Instrument Unit of the Saturn third stage. However, the orbit is very close to nominal; about 90 nautical miles by 93 nautical miles [167 by 172 km]. And we look very good, both with respect to the spacecraft and with respect to the Saturn third stage which must perform that burn, putting Apollo 17 on its trajectory toward the Moon. At 34 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston.
Okay, Flow Control, Power - Power. Primary Glycol To Rad valve, Normal. Push. That's why I want to get going.
Primary Glycol To Rad - Push. It's Normal.
Okay, ECS Rad Heater, Prim 1. Okay, Prim Out below Prim In. We're already there. That's beautiful.
It is.
Glycol Evap, Temp In, going to Auto.
Okay. Potable H2O Heater going to Main A.
We're in Manual. Increase must be increase temperature.
Okay, you're going to see some Master Alarms here, gang.
Master Alarm.
Two's good.
35:10.
The computer is - the computer is with both of our clocks up here.
33 Central Standard Time, 1:33 am Eastern Standard Time. Again, that time 12:33 Central Standard Time, 1:33 Eastern Standard for the post-launch press conference at Cape Kennedy.
Number 5. Check my amps once more.
Your gauges all look good, huh?
Surge Tank Pressure. The Cryo Fans; we'll leave them the way they are.
Heaters are On and up.
Rad talkbacks are gray.
Main Reg B is going Closed.
Emergency Cabin Pressure's - 1.
Okay, push to test.
Okay. B is going Open.
A is Closed.
Okay, it's going to 2.
Push to test.
Main Reg A is Open.
Okay. Emergency Cabin Pressure is in Both.
Give me a battery relay bus reading when you turn the [garble] on.
Five Bravo is about 3.45.
Okay, Ron - Well, Jack can pick up - he can pick these things up, so we don't miss any of them. And you can start getting some cameras out.
Primary Rad talkback - gray.
Okay. It's back on.
Okay. You want a nominal - Let's see, what do I want to do? S-IVB TLI-1?
Let's see here. We got to get a camera out, huh?
Okay. And I'm double checked here on normal - normal and latched.
There it went - with that switch.
Okay. You got all the optic stuff; right, Ron?
Okay, you guys. Except for - except for one check over here, which I am going to have to unzip here to do, I think...
Okay, let me tell you what you want.
Hello, Houston; how do you read 17?
17, read you loud and clear.
Hey, we're going real well up here, Bob. Have no significant anomalies as yet; and we've just about completed our part of the insertion checklist. Gene has his SCS check yet, and Ron's got some P52 numbers for you. And the only thing I've seen so far is a - some spurious Master Alarm without caution and warning that seem to be associated with moving switches on panel 2.
Okay. Can you get a sudden - what switches anywhere - any [garble] any switches on?
So far, it's been fairly random. Some that I remember is the Secondary Coolant Loop Evap switch, the Lamp Test switch, - see - I think I got one with the Temp In Auto switch. Gene got one doing something. I can't remember exactly what it was.
Okay...
Probably random.
...we copy. Jack, we're standing by for that P52 data. We've only got about a 4-minute - a 5-minute pass here. We'll take the 52 data, and I got a few updates for you.
Okay.
Okay; 52 data is coming. Noun 71 is 24 and 30; Noun 05 is .01; Noun 93s are plus .080, plus .029, plus .018; and we torqued at 35:25.
Okay. We copy that. Okay, while we're filling in some here, you might want to know this, Jack. Your sunset and sunrise times in the Launch Checklist are all off by 8 - approximately 8 minutes and 30 seconds. That every - sunset and sunrise will occur about 8 minutes and 30 seconds sooner than in the - in the Launch Checklist. That's an approximate number.
Okay, we got you.
Okay. And on page 2-17 of the Launch Checklist, you're going to want to delete all reference to Honeysuckle AOS and LOS and delete all reference to Canaries AOS and LOS.
Wilco.
And we want to add an Ascension pass; AOS at Ascension, 01 plus 54 plus 00, and Ascension LOS will be 02:00:16. [Pause.]
Okay, Bob; you're going to have to repeat that.
Okay, stand by. Let me give you a page. On 2-17 - let's go Hawaii AOS first of all. On Hawaii AOS, on page 2-17. AOS...
Go.
...is 01 plus 17 plus 24. Hawaii LOS, 01 plus 22 plus 49. [Pause.]
Gotcha. Now what about the Ascension?
Okay, here - give you the Ascension again now. AOS, 1 plus 54 plus 00. Ascension LOS will be 02:00:16. Over.
Okay, I got those. Hawaii is 1 plus 17 plus 24, and LOS is 1 plus 22 plus 49. And Ascension is AOS, 1 plus 54:00; and LOS, 2 plus 00:16.
Roger, Jack. Good copy. And booster's looking good down here and you're looking good.
Okay, and I'll do a better job of itemizing those switches. We were pressing pretty hard, and I'll - I'll be able to go back and get most of them, I think. And we'll keep an eye on it - on the Master Alarms.
Roger, Jack. We understand. And I think we copied most of what you said there, and we're working on it.
Okay, Bob; other than that Master Alarm, all is well on America, and I understand the booster is looking good to you.
That's affirmative.
And, Bob, let me add that not - we did get spurious Master Alarms without switch movement, but many came with switch movements. We've had about seven.
Okay; understand. [Pause.]
That was only after insertion. [Pause.]
Seven times that your heart doesn't need, huh?
Oh, we were paying attention to a sunset that was the biggest...
Sunrise.
...or sunrise or something that we saw. It was the biggest rainbow I'd ever seen.
Beautiful. [Pause.] We can't wait to hear what you had to say about that - the ignition on the S-II. It sounded pretty spectacular.
Bob, just let it be said that that was quite a booster ride. When we get a chance a little later...
Roger.
...maybe we'll be able to tell you something.
We're about ready to lose comm here. You're looking great, guys, and we'll pick you up in Hawaii here shortly.
Okay, we're looking at the deserts of Australia right now and, again, everything's good onboard.
Roger. Pick you up at 01:17:24.
Rog.
Well, I'll tell you [garble].
Okay, 11, 6 [garble].
Don't let it out, Ron.
Verb 16, Noun 20.
Would you believe the GDC drifts just like it does...
Okay, sports fans. You want to extend the docking probe or do you want to wait?
There are some pretty lively looking clouds down there.
Docking Probe circuit breakers, two, Closed.
[Garble] go to Extend. It's out. Okay. Do that. Go to Retract. Go gray?
Let's see - yes, better get back.
Maps are hard to get out. Hey, you want a map?
Yes, we're there.
Hello, earthlings. We're back with you.
Roger, Jack. Read you loud and clear; how us?
You're loud and clear. And no change systems-wise that I've seen.
Roger, Jack. Any more Master Alarms?
We had one when Ron's - looked like his neck ring hit panel 2. [Garble]
Okay. Sounds like we had something loose in panel 2, huh?
Yeah. I don't know - it may be annoying, but so far it doesn't seem to be a problem.
Roger. Just for your information, everything is looking outstanding and no problems. We're taking a good look at the data here at Hawaii, and we'll make a Go/No-Go decision about 60 seconds after acquisition at Goldstone. But there's nothing right now to lead us to believe that zero opportunity will be required.
Okay, Bob, understand that. We are prepared, however. Spacecraft, other than those Master Alarms, is looking very good. We got the docking probe extended. The SCS reference attitude check is complete.
Roger. [Pause.]
Okay, Bob, I just remembered another switch that I think gave us a Master Alarm was H2O Quantity Indicator.
Roger. Copy that, Jack. H2O Quantity Indicator.
Roger we're - 17, we're going to lose you in about 30 seconds. But when you get over the stateside here, we're going to take - take the dump on the data, and we'll read it out real carefully so when you get in TLC we ought to be able to see where that Master Alarm glitch is coming in to.
Okay, Bob. And - yell at me if you want anything done on the comm with this change in AOS/LOS stuff.
Negative on that right now. We'll see you at 01:28:59 through Goldstone.
Okay, 01:28:59, Bob. We'll be there.
Roger, Gene.
We sam - we saw all three stagings, now, or all three ignitions.
Yes, 90-degree launch azimuth means we're on our next latitude. We're coming up on our next latitude, which is Cape [garble] latitude - the next latitude will be for the Cape.
Turn on your lights, San Diego. Boy, it's pretty near over my home, I guess.
Yes.
17, Houston. We're back with you.
Okay, Bob. We're still same as before and ready when you are for TLI.
Roger.
I can see the lights of southern California, Bob.
Roger, Jack.
We're going to be going a little bit south of that area.
Right. Your ground track looks like it's taking you right up over the mid part of Baja California.
Yes, sir; I'll believe that. I'll bet you I can see Ensenada right now.
Roger.
Bob, I expect he'll probably be able to see the lights of Silver City, too.
Well, I'm sure going to be looking for them, I'll tell you. [Long pause.]
Jack, just for your information, you'll probably - when you come up a little farther in this orbit here and get over Mexico, you should be able to see all that bad weather that was giving us so much worry and had Tindall and New Orleans and everything all messed up this morning when I went through there. They had a pretty bad line of weather along there.
I was assuming it wasn't too bad. I think you made it, didn't you?
Oh, yeah, I made it, but I had to - you know, I had to work at it. But it's a - we were - I was worried about it getting down as towards MILA there after - you know if we had to scrub and go tomorrow night. Boy, I'm sure glad we got you off tonight.
Guess who else is.
No, I can't - I wouldn't believe that.
Parker can't make it back. He's got to come back on the Gulfstream. So you might have to have Young on for a while after we do a TLI.
Hey, you just wouldn't believe, Bob, the lights you can see in the west right now. It must be absolutely clear.
Roger, Jack. Sounds spectacular. [Pause.] Jack, people in the room here want to know if you've been down your checklist yet?
Oh, we got that out of the way in about 5 minutes. Have we missed something?
There's a different checklist here we're talking about.
[Laughter.]
If you're talking about the Flight Plan, yes.
Roger.
What a waste.
If I'm not mistaken, we must be just south of Arizona now. Is that right, Bob?
That looks real good. Yes, you're over Mexico there, and looks like you're - oh - maybe a hundred miles south of the border there.
Okay. I was pretty sure I was looking up in the Phoenix-Tucson complex there.
Roger. Understand.
Beautiful...
Little better than [garble] Florida.
The west is always that way. [Pause.] I wish it was daylight so we could see Sonora and that country. That's spectacular, I'll bet you.
Roger. [Garble].
Man's field of stars on the Earth is competing with the heavens, Bob.
Bob, you're coming through with a large squeal right now in the background.
Understand, [garble].
Okay, I think we got the Gulf Coast showing up now by the band of lights, Bob.
Roger.
Okay, Bob. Assume the booster is still looking good, and we'll be Go for a nominal TLI.
That's affirmative.
Okay.
And you're still coming up with a loud squeal.
Roger. [Garble].
17, how do you read?
Would you believe we're just south of Houston now, Bob? [Long pause.]
17, are you receiving Houston now?
All right, Bob. You came up unreadable with the squeal that time.
Am I still squealing? This is Houston.
That's affirm. You're very loud, almost unreadable with the squeal. [Pause.] Bob, why don't you give us the short count?
Geno, don't change anything. We think it's a ground site situation here, and just stand by.
I believe it's in the VHF, Bob. [Long pause.]
Okay, Bob. I'm not sure exactly where we are, but I'm looking out - to an awful lot of horiz - lights on the horizon out there at 12 o'clock, and an awful lot of lightning in the clouds out there.
Roger. I - we show you just about over the middle of the Gulf. Looking ahead, you're probably seeing the very southern tip of Florida there.
It looks like almost the entire Florida peninsula has got lights - out by in it somewhere.
Roger. How does my comm sound to you now, Gene?
Okay, give us a quick short count.
Roger. Short count follows: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; short count out.
Bob, you're all right now.
Okay.
And can you give us a feel for what the final weather was at the Cape - at launch?
Yeah. Let me get that for you. The reason why we had that problem on the comm is we just handed over from Texas to MILA, and we're - and you're going through MILA now. And it's great. So we have a little problem with our Texas site.
Okay.
The television coverage had you all the way through staging very well on - and the S-II ignition. Then, you went right behind a cloud for a while, but they were tracking you pretty well.
Okay.
They also - cut in for about a half minute or so and showed a view of the crowd in just the available light from the booster, and it stood out pretty well.
Okay, Bob. We're going right over Florida now, looking down at Miami. A beautiful view of the Keys all lit up, and I just saw a shooting star right over Miami.
Roger. [Long pause.]
That's a very, very fine view of Miami. Hard to believe.
I'll bet they sat there and watched you go. [Long pause.]
Looks like we're right over the Bahamas now, Bob.
Roger. I'll buy that. [Pause.]
Well, I'm not easily impressed, Bob. But I'm certainly impressed by this one.
Roger. What's the CMP doing? We haven't heard much from him. is - is he at the other window?
He's crawling around looking for things down in the LEB.
[Laughter.] Okay. They won't let you have a window tonight, huh, Ron?
No, I'll catch one here pretty quick. [Pause.]
Just a reminder, if you haven't already done it. There's no need to unstow the TV, because due to this late launch, there's just no site available.
Okay, Bob. We're not going to unstow it.
Bob, I don't - I guess there's no site available for some time, is that correct?
That's affirmative. And if I can pull one of you guys away from a window, I've got a TLI plus 90 PAD.
Oh, I'd love to copy that. Just a minute.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 17. How do you read?
17, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. Lost you there for a minute. We had good signal strength all through that, so I figured it was your problem.
Roger. We're just waiting here - You ready for the PAD?
We were calling you, and you missed us. So you might think about that. Ready for the PAD.
Okay. It's a TLI plus 90, SPS/G&N; 66953; minus 0.59, plus 1.88; ignition time, 004:40:01.48; minus 0351.8, minus 0000.1, plus 3378.2; roll is 180, 073, 003; Noun 94 [means Noun 44] is - HA is not applicable, HP is plus 0020.1; 3396.4, 4:50, 3380.8; sextant star is number 11, that's 11, 342.4, 32.3. Stand by. 17, Houston; are you still reading me? [Long pause.]
Hey, Houston, if you read, we're reading you. Got you all the way through the trunnion on sextant star.
Okay, we'll have to wait and pick you up at Ascension. We just had a keyhole pass at Bermuda, and a little bit of a pass at Vanguard.
Okay, I'll wait for you to finish that, and on the readback. Okay.
That's affirmative. Stand by. We've got Vanguard, I can continue on with - after trunnion, the boresight star is not applicable, Jack. Noun 61, plus 13.29, minus 032.00; 1099.2, 34904; GET of .05G, 024:38:09. Want to read back that much of the PAD, Jack?
Okay, Bob. It's TLI plus 90 PAD, SPS/G&N; 66953; minus 0.59, plus 1.88; 004:40:01.48; minus 0351.8, minus four zeros 1, plus 3378.2; 180, 073, 003; HA is NA; plus 0020.1; 3396.4, 4:54, 3380.8; 11, 342.4, 32.3. Boresight is NA; plus 13.29, minus 032.00; 1099.2, 34904; 024:38:09. Over.
Roger, Jack. Good readback except burn time is 4:50 and not 4:54. And we'll be losing you here in about a minute, so wait on the rest of that PAD. Just a reminder for Ron, we'll be standing by at Ascension for the next gyro torquing and we, might have a drift update on the IMU there. [Pause.]
Okay, he copied that. And we'll wait for the rest of the PAD.
Okay.
Burn time was 4:50 - I think that was when you started to cut out.
Roger.
17, this is Houston through ARIA. How do you read? Over.
17, Houston. Through ARIA, how do you read? Over.
17, Houston. Through ARIA, how do you read?
17, Houston. How do you read through ARIA?
17, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. You're back with us. I'll finish up that TLI plus 90 PAD so we can talk a little here if you want.
Go ahead.
Okay. Set stars are Sirius and Rigel; R-align is 318; 148; 358. There'll be no ullage. Okay. Down at the bottom of the PAD we've got the P37 for Lift-off plus 9. GET is 009:00; Delta-VT, 4897; longitude, minus 175; GET of 400K, 033:49. Over.
Okay, Bob. Zero - Sirius and Rigel; 318; 148; 358; no ullage; 009:00; 4897; minus 175; 033:49. Over.
Okay, Jack. Good readback.
Okay, Bob. We had - as usual - up here [laughter] a spectacular sunrise, and Gene wants to talk to you.
I got some numbers on Ron's P52 for you, Bob.
Okay; standing by to copy. Go ahead.
Okay. Noun 71 were stars 22 and 24; Noun 05 are all balls; Noun 93s are all minus. They're 00.037, 00.007, and 00.021. That's minus 37, minus 07, and minus 21; and they were torqued at 01:51:40.
Okay. We copy. [Long pause.]
Bob, we're over - what might be - intermediate to low stratus that have a very strong crenulation pattern - pulling out some geological terms here. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it flying.
Roger.
Looks like about a north-south lineation with a very strong crinkling, roughly east-west.
Roger. Copy that; that's interesting. You know, you're just directly over that South Atlantic area. Your - you - your path just kind of kept you going right between the - Africa and South America, right dead center all the way. [Long pause.]
And, 17, just for your information, we've searched all the data we can, and we cannot find anything wrong with the spacecraft or the booster at all. Everything is looking real fine, and the only problem in the air is that - those Master Alarms which you have reported - we're not able to tie in anything common yet to any of those things either.
Okay, Bob. We have not had any for - quite some time, I think, since the last time we talked to you about them.
Roger. Understand. We'll probably get a good workout on that after TLI and try and track it down a little more.
Okay. But, also, we have not really been doing much switching since the insertion checklist was complete, either.
Roger. Understand. It's got you glued to the windows, I guess, huh?
They are interesting; I'll say that.
Well, I certainly am, Bob, and - again there's a big - a fairly continuous intermediate cloud deck, I think. And it has patterns comparable to what I've seen on pictures of ice floes.
Roger. Understand.
And [pause] of pack ice; I should say pictures of pack ice in the Antarctic. [Pause.]
17, Houston. We've got two questions concerning the Master Alarms. One, do you get the Master Alarm on the LEB also; and, two, do you get the tone with the Master Alarm?
We did get the tones. The Master Alarms were on both - panel 1 and panel 3. I can't tell you about the LEB right now. Maybe Ron can.
No, I didn't pay that much attention.
Okay.
Hey, Bob, there was something interesting I wanted to get around to tell you. The - Mission Timer down in the LEB, when Ron went down there to get things squared away, was about 15 seconds or so behind all the other clocks.
Roger. We copy that.
Okay; and we reset it - re synced it - and it's been running okay. I don't know whether that's a clue to anything or not, but apparently it happened either during launch - or somewhere before we got down there right after insertion.
Okay, we're going to lose you here in about 9 seconds. You are Go is looking great, and we'll work on it, and if you get another MEV, will you check the LEB for us?
Yes sir, I sure will do, Bob. We'll see you. What's our next AOS?
Stand by. Carnarvon at 2:25.
Thank you.
17, Houston. How are you doing?
Stand by. It's Carnarvon at 02:25...
Thank you.
I see you're trying.
17, Houston. How are you doing?
Well, we're pretty good. You're wavering here a little bit on signal strength.
Okay. We've got a TLI PAD any time you're ready to copy it, Jack.
Goodness; okay, let me get rid of something here. Ron, I'm putting that right underneath you.
And, guys, we'd like P00 and Accept, please.
Okay.
You'll get a CSM state vector if you'll give us P00 and Accept.
Got P00 and Accept.
Okay. Let me have my favorite PAD.
Okay. Here's the TLI PAD. Time base 6 at 3:02:57; 180, 312, 000; 5:51; Delta-VC is 10359.6, 35582; 000, 345, 040; extraction will be at 300, 165, 320; 312.0, 306.0, 57:10, yaw is 0; ejection time, 4 plus 39 plus 00. Over. [Pause.]
Okay, Houston. Here's your TLI PAD. 3:02:57; 180, 312, 000; 5:51; 10359.6, 35582; 000, 345, 040; 300, 165, 320; 312.0, 306.0, 57:10, 000; ejection time, 4 plus 39 plus 00.
Good readback, Jack; and we'd like Omni Charlie, and it's your computer, and you've got your state vector.
Okay. You've got Omni Charlie. [Pause.] And, Bob, we had almost a completely weather-free pass over Africa and Madagascar. And the scenery - both aesthetically and geologically - was something like I've never seen before, for sure.
Roger.
We got odds and ends on the tape and quite a bit on the film.
Roger; good show. Are you saying that you didn't have any weather over that southern Africa there?
Not very much. Barely broken clouds in some places. Most of the countryside was clear.
Roger.
There were - patterns - like I haven't even seen in textbooks. Maybe I haven't been looking enough, but some of the desert and grassland patterns were - had the appearance of ice crystals almost, except on a megascale, if you - have ever looked at ice crystals in sand.
Roger. [Pause.]
Or, better yet, ice crystals on your car window when you - get out early in the morning up in northern areas.
Roger. And just be advised, we'll be standing by for the Go/No-Go for Pyro Arm when we get to Hawaii, and we'll be giving you a Go for TLI about that time.
Okay; and we'll be ready. [Pause.]
And, Ron, in - on the Launch Checklist, on 2-25, on the manual and nominal S-IVB TLI-1, add 34 degrees on the nominal PAD for all the pitch angles; and on the manual PAD, add 34.5 degrees to all the pitch angles, and you'll have it right.
Okay, Bob. You [garble]...
And...
...let me get set. That's - okay, we'll just add 34 to the nominal and 34.5 to all the manual ones [garble]...
And you'll want to do that on your cue card also, Ron.
Yeah, that's affirm. [Pause.]
And we're about ready to LOS; we'll see you at Hawaii.
Okay, Bob, we'll see you...
02 plus 50 at Hawaii.
Okay, 50. And we'll be into our TLI checklist, and - we'll be ready for that Pyro Arm.
Okay.
Apollo 17, Houston.
Go ahead.
Houston, this is Apollo 17. Go ahead.
Hey, Ron, you're sounding great. Good voice here.
Oh, yeah, we've got things all set up here and we're kind of standing by for a logic check whenever you guys can give us a Go. [Pause.]
Roger. As soon as we get some TM in here, we'll give you a Go. [Pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
17, Houston. We're ready for the logic check.
Okay, Bob. [Pause.] Okay. Wait 1. [Pause.]
Okay. SECS Arm breakers are closed.
Roger.
Okay; and Logic 1 is On, Mark it...
...and Logic 2 is On...
...Mark it. [Pause.]
17, you're Go for Pyro Arm.
Thank you; understand Go for Pyro Arm.
17...
And, Bob, in case you're interested, there - all through the nightside pass here - there's a - quite a strong - well - stronger than I would have ever expected - horizon glow off to the north. I suspect that, I think Gene said a while ago that it's around on his side also.
Roger. Guys, I've got the word you wanted to hear; you are Go for TLI - you're Go for the Moon.
Okay, Robert. Understand. America and Challenger with their S-IVB are Go for TLI.
That's affirmative.
You're a sweet talker.
We try to please here, Gene. [Pause.]
You know, somehow, Bob, I knew you were going to say that - we were Go - and that you try to please.
We've been working together too long, huh? [Pause.]
Not long enough, yet. [Long pause.]
And, 17; Houston. You're about 1 minute from LOS, and we'll pick you up at Goldstone at about 3 hours and 00 minutes; and that's only a couple of minutes prior to time base 6 start.
Okay, Bob. We'll be with you.
Roger.
Bob, that glow is actually above the horizon, just in case you're curious. I can see - stars below the top of the glow - down closer to the Earth.
Roger, Jack.
17, Houston. We're with you again, and you're looking good.
Okay; mighty fine, Bob.
And, Bob, we've got the Pyros Armed now.
Roger. [Pause.]
And you can expect some different Omni calls as we go LOS and AOS again.
Okay.
I always expect that, Bob.
Roger.
Sep light is On, on time.
Roger. [Pause.]
And it shows time base 6 right on time, Gene.
Okay. [Pause.]
We'd like Omni Delta, please. [Pause.]
Okay, you've got it.
Roger.
I'll just switch, Bob. I won't give you a call.
Roger. [Pause.]
Sep light was Out on time.
Roger, Gene.
Comm check, Bob. [Pause.]
17, Houston; go ahead.
I was just checking with you; you're so quiet down there, we almost forgot you were there.
Roger. Don't want to forget me. We're just watching everything; we can't find anything wrong, so we're just trying to keep quiet here.
Okay, Bob. We're watching the S-IVB tanks pressurize.
Roger. [Pause.]
You ought to look for the good things rather than the bad.
Well, that's good when we don't find anything wrong.
Can't agree more. [Long pause.]
17, the chilldown is in progress, and the tank pressures are looking good.
Okay, Bob; looking good here.
17, Houston. You are Go at 3 minutes prior to ignition. You're looking good, and you're going to - we're going to have A - ARIA coverage all the way through the burn until Ascension.
Roger; understand, Bob. 57:10, ORDEAL Operate...
We're in average g.
Roger. We confirm it. [Long pause.]
SEP light On at 3:06.
Roger. [Long pause.]
17, you're looking great on the final status check here, and you're Go for TLI. [Long pause.]
[Garble] 42, the SEP lights are Out.
Roger. [Long pause.]
The light's on and we have ignition. [Long pause.]
17, Houston. You're looking good, and the thrust is Go.
Bob, you're down in the mud, but we're Go onboard at 20 seconds.
Roger. [Long pause.]
[Garble] antenna. [Long pause.]
One minute, Houston in the blind, and we're Go.
Roger, Gene. We can barely hear you through the ARIA, but you're Go. [Pause.]
You have reasonable signal strength, but you are unreadable. [Long pause.]
Everything's Go at 1:30. [Pause.]
Confirm a PU shift, and Go at 1:45. [Pause.]
17, Houston, We can confirm PU shift, and you are Go. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston, 2:30 - in the blind - we're still Go.
Roger, 17. You're Go; looking great.
Okay, Bob. Got that. Understand we're Go from the ground; and it's a good ride, although it's rumbling around a little bit.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Three minutes, and we are Go.
Roger, Gene. [Pause.]
Bob, we're going to TLI right through sunrise.
Roger; understand.
Okay, 3:30 is Go. We have - 17 is Go at 3:30.
Roger, 17. [Long pause.]
Okay, Bob, 17 is Go at 4:30. You're still unreadable.
Roger. How do you read me? You are Go, by the way.
Okay, we got you that time. Understand we're Go on the ground, and we're still Go here, and we're TLI-ing right through sunrise.
Understand. [Long pause.]
17, Houston. Your burn time is nominal.
Roger. Understand burn time, nominal. [Long pause.]
Cut-off at 52.
[Laughter.] Did you read the DSKY?
We don't have the DSKY. You have to read it to us, Ron.
Okay. VI is - I got a 00 and a 00 and Noun 95 VI is 35573 - is a plus 9.
And, Bob, the EMS is minus - EMS is minus 19.4, minus 19.4.
Roger. We copy that.
And it was an auto cut-off - auto cut-off on time.
Understand a guided cut-off on time. Looking great.
And I am watching tank pressures - are venting, the tanks are venting.
Understand. The tanks are venting.
