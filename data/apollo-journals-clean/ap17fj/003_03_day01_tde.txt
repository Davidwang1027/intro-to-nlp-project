Okay, Houston, how do you read?
17, Houston. We'd like Omni Delta.
Okay. I picked it up a little bit. How do you read now?
Read you loud and clear.
Okay. I hope you got all that. It was a beautiful burn, right through sunrise. Did you get the numbers?
Yeah, we copied your VI and your EMS numbers, and we've got a number for you. Maneuver start time will be at 3 plus 33 plus 27. [Long pause.]
Okay, we got you. Maneuver at 03:33:27.
That's affirmative, Jack. [Pause.]
You guys didn't tell us we couldn't see anything going through the sunrise.
[Laughter.] Roger. [Long pause.]
17, Houston. We're making plans here for a spacecraft Sep time of 03 plus 43. [Pause.]
03 plus 43. Roger.
17, Houston. We're copying cabin press of 5.9 this time.
Roger. We - we just got it, Bob.
Okay.
Thank you.
Frame 65 for the LMPs mag November November.
Okay. We - we are maneuvering, Houston.
Roger. We're watching it. [Long pause.]
Now we've got a few very bright particles or fragments or something that go drifting by as we maneuver.
Roger. Understand. [Pause.]
There's a whole bunce of big ones on my window down there - just bright.
It looks like the Fourth of July out of Ron's window. [Pause.]
Yeah. Now you can see some of them in shape. They're very jagged, angular fragments that are tumbling.
Roger. They look like fluid of some sort?
Not to me. They look like pieces of something.
Roger.
They're very bright.
Jack, we'd like Omni Charlie.
Bob, for the most part, these fragments are not - or are tumbling at a very slow rate. I tried a couple pictures of them - different settings. You may get an idea of what, at least, the patterns look like.
Roger. I've got you. We're all ears on these fragments if you think you can figure out what they might be.
Well, you know I - I don't know. There are a number of possibilities. If you had some kind of a - I got the impression maybe they were curved a little bit, as if they might be - off the side of the S-IVB. And that's a wild guess...
Okay. RCS Logic is [garble]...
...ice chunks, possibly. Or maybe there's paint coming off of it.
Rog. I noticed on one trip up the elevator last week near one of the flags. I thought it was on the S-II, but it might have been on the S-IVB. Looked like it was peeling. Maybe that's what you've got.
And the S-IVB maneuver is complete.
[Garble] on Main A.
Okay. We'll set the old clock.
Okay. And the - with the maneuver complete, the fragment field is essentially static, except for very slight tumbling within the fragments.
Roger. Copy that.
Every once in a while, a fragment of considerably higher velocity than the others goes across my window. But that's very rare.
Roger. [Pause.]
Hey, that's that field of view I saw out my window, Jack, do you see it now?
Yes.
And, Bob. At least, there - there's no apparent relative motion between fragments.
Roger. Understand.
I'll take two pictures about a minute apart if I can. And it'll be Frame 70. [Pause.]
Okay. Frame 70.
And, Bob. This is Geno. My impression is that they are - flat, flake-like particles. Some may be 6 inches across. And, although there's no relative motion between the two, most of them seem to be twinkling. And I think, for the most part, they're all moving away from us.
Roger, Gene. Thank you. [Long pause.]
Okay. We've got 0180 and 0 on the old thumbwheels.
Okay. [Pause.]
Roger, Ron. [Pause.]
Okay. Trans Control is Armed.
[Garble] two Armed.
Controller number 2 is Armed.
[Garble] SECS Logic [garble].
Okay. SECS Logic is Closed; SECS Arm are Closed; Logic Power is On.
Okay.
17, Houston. You have a Go for T&D.
Okay. A Go for T&D. [Long pause.]
Okay. We'll Arm the Pyros. [Pause.] And we'll hit the GDC Align.
And maneuver's complete. Okay 0180 and 0, on the GDC. [Pause.] No. It's just [garble] it's kind of diddling.
Okay. Delta-V in Normal. [Long pause.]
S-IVB, okay. [Pause.] Okay, switches are all set.
Okay; 59:30.
Okay. Let's start the DET.
Tickity-tick-tickity.
Houston. We're running at 59:30.
Roger.
Okay. [Pause.]
Okay. That's Launch Vehicle Sep, push button.
Okay. [Pause.]
MC in Auto. [Pause.]
Next?
Separation, Houston.
Okay, check the covers. Okay. And check the other ones off.
They're all...
Okay, I'm going to start the - My god, look at the junk! Okay; there's 15 seconds. Pitch her up. Okay, we'll Proceed on the... [Pause.]
Okay, we've already Proceeded, James. [Pause.]
Okay, we've checked her out. [Pause.]
Houston, we're right in the middle of a snowstorm [laughter].
Roger. And we'd like Omni Delta.
Hey, look at that burst. It's going to be bright as all get out.
And there goes one of the SLA panels.
Yep. [Pause.]
We're not there yet. Long ways to go yet. It's on the other side of the Earth, if the simulator's any good. [Long pause.]
Oh, man!
There goes another SLA panel, Houston, going the other way.
Yes.
[Garble] normal [garble].
I've...
Hey, there's the booster!
Roger. Bet you never saw the SLA panels on the simulator.
No, but we've got the booster and is she pretty. Challenger's just sitting in her nest.
Roger. We'd like Omni Bravo, now, Jack. [Pause.]
Okay, I'll plus-X it. We'll see the - oh, you can't see [garble]. [Pause.] Okay. Oh, I can't see my COAS.
And, Houston, some of the particles going by the window...
Okay, did you change the DAC?
...were obvious enough - fairly obvious to me - paint.
Okay. We'll buy that. [Pause.]
Okay. There it is. [Pause.] Okay, did you change the DAP? Got Att 1/Rate 2? [Pause.]
Okay, Houston, you want the High Gain? [Pause.]
Roger. We're standing by for it, and the angles as published on L/3-3 should be good.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, it's flying pretty good. [Long pause.]
Okay, we're in Reacq here. [Long pause.]
Houston, how do you read? We don't have a very good knock - lock on here in Reacq.
Roger, Jack. We're reading you pretty good - voice. [Pause.]
Okay. It looks like it's improving. It dropped off - signal strength dropped off, and now it's picking up again.
Roger.
We're getting good signal now, Jack. [Pause.]
Jack, the High Gain is looking good. [Pause.]
Oh, okay.
I'm guessing. I don't know - about a hundred [garble]...
That's good news. It seemed to smoo - slew very smoothly, so it looks all right.
Roger, Jack.
Att 1/Rate 2? [Long pause.]
I can't tell you too much, Bob, from the center seat other than Captain America is very intent on getting Challenger at the moment.
Roger. I can believe that. [Pause.]
Yeah, I'm coming in a little slow, but we've got plenty of time. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. While we're moving in here, I can see a few chunks of that platy material, possibly paint, down in the SLA sort of bouncing around between the S-IVB and the LM.
Roger. [Pause.]
But, so far, LM looks very clean. Can't see anything abnormal from this view yet.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Isn't it, though? That thing is really stable out there.
Yeah. Can you see it at all, Gene? [Long pause.]
Got one little chunk coming out - it just came out of the SLA, and it's spinning along a long axis, and it looks very stable.
Roger.
Every once in a while, a small particle flies off of it though.
How big of a chunk are you talking about, Jack?
Say again?
How big an item are you talking about?
Oh, I - reference to the thrusters, about the same diameter as the thruster on the LM.
Oh, Roger.
That's how long it was, and about - oh, a fifth that thick or that wide.
Roger.
And I don't think - I don't think it's more than a quarter of an inch or maybe even less thick. [Pause.]
That same particle, Bob, came by and as it was spinning, it was throwing off pieces of itself - radially out.
Roger. We copy.
There's small ones come floating by and it looked like flakes. [Long pause.] And I think I caught three of the four SLA panels going as we were maneuvering. I've got one out the hatch window now. It's quite a ways out...
Roger.
...and tumbling in all three axes.
And I saw the fourth one out my side, so we saw them all. [Long pause.]
Area around the two spacecraft is cleaned up pretty well by now. There are just a few fragments moving around. [Long pause.]
Now she's coming in. [Long pause.]
Rover looks in good shape, so far.
Roger, Jack. Can you see down on that quad? Is that what you're looking at?
Yes, I'm looking right at it. [Pause.] And I got a good view of the MESA top anyway. It's pretty well covered, but it looks all right also.
Roger.
All the antennas look good; thruster quads all look great. I could see all four of them a minute ago.
Okay, about 10 feet there, Gene. Stand by for a [garble] on the barber pole. [Long pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
All right; in good shape. [Long pause.]
About now. [Pause.]
Capture, Houston.
Roger. We copy.
Okay, we're Free; rates look pretty good. [Pause.] Let's lock it together.
Okay. You ready?
Ready. She's lined up not bad.
Okay.
Prime 1.
Mark it. Stand by.
Here she comes. [Pause.]
Ka-chunk. By gosh!
Okay, Houston, ripple fire; but we still have number A barber pole.
Roger. We copy.
And we have a Master - and a Master Alarm.
Roger.
We got - we got the most of the latches, but A is barber pole, and B is gray.
Okay, check both circuit breakers; they're In. Yeah, Okay. [Pause.]
We had one clear fire, maybe one or two latches and then a ripple fire on the rest.
Roger.
And, by the way, I had a good view into the AOT, and I can still look in there, and it's very clean.
Roger. [Long pause.]
In fact...
Ron and Gene, we saw your Master Alarm. Did you have any - anything on the matrix light up?
No, not a thing. I looked.
Roger.
Okay, Bob, we're going to go ahead and take a look at that docking malfunction before we press on here further and check this barber pole out.
Roger, We're working some words up here. We'll be back with you in a second on that, Gene.
Okay. We're down on the checklist through the EDS Power breakers, Open.
Understand. [Long pause.]
And, Houston, in case we didn't tell you, it's talkback A that's barber pole.
Understand. We have it. [Long pause.]
Say - say, Gene, we don't think it's a problem. We'll find out what it is when you get in. We think we should just press right on with the Flight Plan checklist and keep going. [Pause.]
Okay, we concur with that. Okay, we'll press on, Bob. [Long pause.]
Okay, Bob. We just got a Master Alarm when I went to the Retract Prime, from 1 to Off.
Roger. We copy that. Looks like panel 2 is jinxed up there, huh?
Okay, O2 Heater number 3 went to Auto. [Pause.]
Roger. We copy that.
Okay, Bob. We're reading a Delta-P of greater than 4, and I'm going to open the Pressure Equalization Valve now.
Roger, 17. We copy that. [Long pause.]
Okay, the Delta-P is coming down, Bob.
Roger. [Long pause.]<
Gene, while you're watching that, I just thought you'd be interested. We talked to some of our friends down at the Cape who watched the launch, and they said you were aglow all the way until you faded into - you couldn't tell you from a star. They saw staging, and they could just see you as a star way off in the distance until you faded out. Not a cloud in the way at all.
Beautiful. Okay, we're at - we're at 2, and we're monitoring it for 3 minutes.
Okay.
And, Houston. While we're checking the integrity here, on mag Alpha Alpha, there's about 50 per cent.
Mag Alpha Alpha, 50 per cent. Roger.
Okay, Bob. That's 3 minutes. It's - Delta-P change is less than 0.1.
Three minutes and less than 0.1.
We are pressing on. [Pause.]
Rog; press.
Okay, you want cabin's at 4.8 now; Repress is about empty. [Pause.] Okay. No, not yet, it's still getting a little bit. [Pause.]
That Repress Package Valve is kind of noisy. [Pause.]
That's all the Repress O2. We'll turn that Off.
Okay, Houston, the Repress Package is empty now, and we're down to a Delta-P of 0.2.
Roger. We copy that. [Pause.]
And, 17. Just be advised, you're going to have an S-IVB non-propulsive vent start 04:18:27- You've got about 3 minutes on that.
[Laughter.] Okay. Thank you.
Can you reach [garble] there?
Yeah, I'll get them.
Okay, Bob. We seem to be holding Delta-P at about 0.2. I suspect that's probably zero.
Roger. We copy that. [Pause.]
And the cabin pressure's about 4.5. You want us to wait until 5 psi for the Emergency Cabin Pressure Selects?
Negative on that. Let's just go ahead and just press on.
Okay. [Pause.] They should be Both.
Okay, Emergency register working. [Pause.]
Coming down though, Gene. Let's wait until it gets down a little ways. [Long pause.]
Yeah.
Yeah. Straight up and down as well. [Pause.]
Up point one. Must be the non-propulsive vent that's banging. [Laughter.] Here comes all the - look at all the stuff going again. It's really glowing.
Your non-propulsive vent gives quite a glow.
Roger, Jack. [Pause.]
It looks like a rainbow. Dark one. [Long pause.]
Okay. Repress Package to Fill. [Pause.]
That ought to take the surge tank down a little bit. About at what? 400? [Long pause.]
500 on the surge. [Pause.] No, they ought to be closed off by now, I think. Yeah.
17, Houston.
Go ahead.
Rog. Be advised, you don't have to wait until 5 psi cabin to go ahead and open the hatch.
Okay, we're not, Bob. We're pressing on with it now.
Roger.
Okay, it looks like we're going to maintain about 400 on the surge. [Long pause.]
Okay? [Pause.]
Okay, Houston. The hatch is coming out.
Roger. [Pause.]
[Laughter.] I don't know what you're going to do with it. [Pause.]
Put it up here in the - in the - on the couch. [Long pause.]
There we go.
Hey, that's a lot lighter than it used to be. [Laughter.]
There's going to be a lot of happy people down there, Bob. I haven't checked them all, but visually, they're all locked.
Understand, Gene. All of them are locked.
Let me give them a good check.
Yeah. You'd better check them, because we got a barber pole on that one. [Pause.]
Okay, here's one that didn't come over.
What is the position of it?
7... [Long pause.]
7 and 9? [Long pause.]
Okay, Bob. Maybe we aren't all going to be so happy.
Go ahead.
Okay, 7, 9, and 10 - the handle is flush; the bungee is vertical, but the handle is not locked down, and the - and the red button is showing. And I can pull each one of them back slowly. I haven't done anything with them. That's 7, 9, and 10.
Roger. We copy that. The handle is flush; the bungees are vertical, but the handle is not locked down, and the red button is showing on 7, 9, and 10.
That's affirm. [Long pause.]
Okay, Bob. Bob, I just pushed the handle on 10 home a little bit and it did lock. And the red button is flush. So that leaves me 9 and 7.
Roger; understand. [Pause.]
Geno, go ahead and try the handle on 9 and 7; and, if that doesn't work, cock them and refire them starting with 9, please.
Okay; the handle doesn't work. I'll have to recock them.
Okay. [Long pause.]
When you trip it with your - did you cock it twice?
Yeah.
And it took two cocks to make it go?
Yes.
Okay.
Okay, 9 cocked twice; it tripped. It is overcenter and locked.
Roger. How about the barber pole now?
Okay. Wait a minute, I've got - Docking Probe Main A circuit breaker's In and gone to Retract, and it's gray.
Okay...
Aha! That did it.
Roger. [Pause.] And... [Long pause.]
Okay, Bob. Cocked 7 twice and tripped it, and it's overcenter and locked.
Roger.
I think that takes care of them all.
Good show. [Long pause.]
Okay, [pause] Docking Probe circuit breakers are Out and Extend/Retract is Off. [Pause.]
Because it belongs on the probe. [Garble] it's painted yellow, it belongs on the probe.
Okay, Bob. The umbilicals are connected.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston, 7-Delta on the test meter is now reading 1.0, it jumped up to 2.6, and is now back to 1.0.
Roger. We copy. That's good. [Long pause.]
There we go. Okay. There, we're going up in the tunnel.
Pretty good ham sandwich. [Long pause.]
Okay, Bob, the hatch is back in. [Pause.]
Roger, Gene.
17, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Rog. We've got some new - new angles here for you. [Pause.]
Stand by a minute, and let me find a place to copy them.
What - what kind of angles are they, Bob?
They're your Noun 22 attitude maneuver for APS burn out of the hatch window. They're in the middle of the page L/3-5.
Oh, okay.
Instead of 270, we want 274.
Wait 1. We're not quite with you.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay. I think I'm with you at 3-7; go.
It's on 3-5, Jack, middle of the page there. Those Noun 22s.
Okay, I take it back; 3-5, middle of the page.
Okay. You notice there's three angles there - 270, make that 274. [Pause.]
Okay. That the only change?
And the - no, the next one, the 129-8, change that to 164. [Pause.] And 4.3 on the yaw, change that to zero. It's close enough; zero on the yaw. [Pause.]
Okay. We got them 274, 164, 00.
Roger, and the High Gain angles that you've got on the Flight Plan are close enough and should do it. [Pause.]
Very good.
Okay. We're 6 frames a second. [Pause.] Okay, what - what did [garble]. Range [garble]. [Pause.]
Okay, I'll - I'll leave it at 10 feet and about an f - f/8. [Long pause.] Okay, [garble] at set. [Long pause.] Because I had that one to 0180 to 0. [Long pause.]
Okay, Bob. We're aligning our GDC, and the next thing we'll pick up will be the SECS Arm circuit breakers. And we'll give you a call on the Logic.
Roger, Gene. [Long pause.]
Okay, Bob. While we're waiting, does the balance on the...
I see what you mean [laughter].
...H2 and O2 flow in fuel cell 3 - well, actually, in all three fuel cells, look pretty good to you? [Long pause.]
Jack, the flows look just right for the current.
Okay. Used to seeing them more or less lined up, and I hadn't calculated any farther than that.
Roger.
O2 - O2 seems a little higher H2, relatively speaking. [Laughter.] [Long pause.]
Okay. That's pretty close. [Pause.] Verified: SECS Arm breakers are Closed.
Okay, Houston. We're ready to come up with the Logic. [Pause.]
Okay, Houston, Logic 1 is coming on now and Logic 2.
Roger. [Long pause.]
And, Houston, just to keep track of EMS null bias check that time, was - went from 100 to 100.7 in 100 seconds. [Pause.]
17, we'd like to just verify on that top line S-IVB/LM Sep circuit breakers - both of them are Closed?
Okay, we'll verify them again. We doublechecked them.
Okay, we just didn't hear your call and we want to make sure of that. Didn't want to miss anything here.
Okay. They are - they are verified Closed, and Jack just checked them again.
Okay. You are Go for Pyro Arm and Go for extraction.
Okay, Go for Pyro Arm; Go for Pyro extraction - or LM extraction [laughter].
Okay, Pyro Arm.
Okay, we'll Arm the old Pyros. There's Pyro A; Pyro B.
Servo Power number 1 [garble].
TVC Servo Power, AC 1.
Trans Control Power, up and On.
Trans Control Power is On.
Okay, Rot Controllers are Armed. [Pause.] Okay, I'll wait just a little bit on that - EMS to Normal. Get Delta-V [garble]. [Long pause.]
Okay, EMS to Normal? Push right there. Yep.
Okay; on my mark, the S-IVB/LM Sep will come on.
Okay, and then I'll back it off to... [pause]. Okay?
Okay, on my mark, S-IVB/LM Sep: 3, 2, 1...
Mark it. Okay, we got it.
Oh, ho! Man, did we! There she goes. Yeah; LM came with us.
Okay, we're CMC, Auto. All right. We've got six tenths. It's all right. Okay, whoopee-dee-doo! [Pause.]
Safe the Pyros. [Pause.] Okay, Logic'S Off. [Pause.]
SECS - SECS Arm breakers are Open. [Long pause.]
Now I think we ought to go to the maneuver pretty quick. Otherwise, the S-IVB will be so far away you can't see it. [Pause.] Okay, you ready to maneuver?
Okay, CMC in Auto, caged. Away we go. [Pause.] That - that [garble] wasn't as bad as the original Sep. [Pause.]
Yeah. [Pause.]
Came right out, though.
Mapping Camera and Pan Camera are Off. [Pause.]
Okay. [Pause.] Power's Off. Hey, Jack. Hand me the Hasselblad. I think we're bowing the right direction. [Pause.] Yeah, the Moon is there. The Earth is - that's the Earth. [Pause.]
Servo Power's Off, yes.
The Earth just fills up window 5. [Pause.] Okay, f, infinity, about a 250th, f/11.
What - what do you have? A zero in there? Hey, I lost my watch. Turn the AC Off. Yeah, AC's Off. Whoo, what a beauty! What a beauty! Yeah, the Earth. I can't see the S-IVB. It's gone. [Pause.]
Look at that.
Yeah, Madagascar and Africa. Mada... [Pause.]
[Garble] see it.
Got to be.
Yeah, as soon as I find the S-IVB, we'll... [Pause.]
Hey, there's Antarctica. It's all full of snow. [Pause.] Okay. You want to look? [Pause.]
Yeah. [Pause.]
Yeah. Oh, there it goes, there. [Pause.] Looks kind of empty down there without the LM...
Okay, Bob, we're looking right up the dome of the S-IVB. [Pause.]
Roger. We copy that. We're standing by for your Go for yaw maneuver. [Long pause.]
Yeah. We can give them a Go for - for the yaw, can't we? We can see it now.
Yes, we can see it. You've got the Go for the yaw. [Pause.]
Roger. Thank you, 17. [Pause.]
Looks like she came out of there clean as a whistle.
17, Houston. The yaw maneuver will be starting in about 4 plus 52, a little less than 2 minutes from now.
Okay.
Sounds like you are taking a picture of that old dome out there, huh?
Oh, we're at the end. [Laughter.] We're at the end - you know. [Long pause.]
[Garble.] [Long pause.]
Hey, there it goes. Look at the aft fire of the thing.
And we can see it firing now. [Pause.]
Roger, 17. Yaw maneuver started. [Long pause.]
The old S-IVB had a flare for the dramatic, but it certainly did its job for us.
Roger, Jack. [Pause.]
Preliminary data indicated that you are about as nominal as you can be.
That's the way we'd like to keep it, Bob.
You'd better believe it.
Okay. She's - as we're looking at it, she's pitching up. She was looking right at us - we were looking right at the dome - and now she's pitching up. The shroud around the IU seems to be totally intact. It - it looked like a super clean separation. I can't really see where there's any paint or anything externally chipped off the - the booster from here. We're beginning to - to pick up the bell. It's really a shame you don't have this - this whole thing on TV; it's really quite a sight.
Roger. We concur with that. [Long pause.]
The Mylar and the gold coating on the inside of the shroud that's now visible is also intact. [Pause.] It looks like you could use it again if you could get it back.
Well, it's got a job to do when it hits the Moon yet. [Long pause.]
Okay, Bob. We've - we're almost looking at it broadside now.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay. She's spitting a little; looks like the yaw maneuver may be complete. [Pause.]
We got a - full view of the - entire J-2 from here; and no kidding, Bob, the whole bird, the shroud at the top by the IU, the separation plane down by the S-II, from here all looks as clean as a whistle, all the way.
Roger, Gene. If you're happy, we'd like a Go from you for the evasive burn.
Okay. You're going to burn on the booster's plus X-axis, is that right?
That's affirmative.
Let's get a picture or two here yet, and we'll give you a Go. [Pause.]
And, Gene, it'll be about 7 minutes until the evasive burn; 5 plus 03.
Okay. You have a Go. [Pause.]
And for your reference, at frame 105 I started a few 250-millimeter pictures of the S-IVB. [Pause.]
Roger, Jack. [Long pause.]
And, Bob, the entire sky, as far as I can make it out through the hatch window, is completely filled with our twinkling flakes. [Pause.]
Roger. We copy that.
I saw a couple particles go by the window awhile back, and it looked a little bit like insulation in this - these particular case - styrofoam insulation, but in flat flakes.
Roger that.
That was right after we separated from the S-IVB.
Roger.
CSM Sep - CSM Sep, Bob.
Roger. Understand.
Bob, I know - I know we're not the first to discover this, but we'd like to confirm, from the crew of America, that the world is round.
Roger. That's a good data point. Have you gotten a good look at any of that weather down there on the Antarctic?
Well, on Ron's window number 1 - maybe he can tell you a little about it.
You know, it's real funny there in Antarctica the - You can see the snow, but there isn't any weather at all in it. All of the weather's around it in the water.
Rog.
That's where the moisture is. [Pause.]
I don't know what to take a picture of. [Long pause.]
I can't see the U.S. at all.
17, Houston.
Go ahead.
Look's like you've got a superconservative CMP up there. We've run off some numbers - Looks like you used about 40 pounds of RCS on the T&D, and you've used about a total of 42 pounds RCS total; so we're hanging right in there. Beautiful.
Very fine; glad to hear that.
[Garble] velvet touch.
Still a little bit too much, but that's not bad.
We'll be glad to leave all that extra, I hope, in the Service Module when we get home. [Long pause.]
It's in the Volkswagen pouch down there. [Long pause.]
Oh, I'll change the lens now.
17, Houston. It's about 30 seconds from the evasive maneuver burn.
Okay.
Here, Jack, can you see him good? Check the settings there. I took an f/22 stop. [Long pause.]
There it goes, Bob.
There it goes; finally.
Roger.
17, Houston. The evasive burn is complete, and the LOX dump will be at 5 plus 24 plus 20.
Okay; 5 plus 24 plus 20.
Roger.
He's going to be gone, I think, before we can see it. [Long pause.]
And, Bob, you can tell Frank to forget the - returning that phone call I made to him a couple days ago.
Rog. Understand.
All my questions are answered.
Think you've had enough booster briefings, huh?
Yep. I figure this is probably the best one of all.
