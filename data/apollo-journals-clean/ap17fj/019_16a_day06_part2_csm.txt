Okay. Challenger, America.
America, Houston; standing by.
Okay, Houston. This is America. We're floating free out here. The Challenger looks real pretty. The residuals on the P41 were plus 1.9, minus 0.2, and 0. Undock and sep was on time.
Sounds good.
America, Houston. When you have an opportunity, how about cycling the High Gain to Wide and back to Reacq?
Okay, Can do.
Thank you, sir.
Okay, America. How about going back to Narrow on the antenna. And could you verify what you loaded on Noun 34? It went by so fast on the downlink, we didn't get it a chance to look at it.
There, you got it?
Okay. That looks good.
Does that look okay?
Yes, sir. Sure does.
Okay. No update then, huh?
That's correct.
Okay.
America, can you verify that you gave us Narrow on the High Gain?
Okay, Houston; America. Had 50 percent on mag Charlie Charlie when I changed mags there for the landmark tracking. And let's see, frame 110, I think - or 112 - let me look on that one.
Hey, Ron; listen. This ridge you're coming on over - just stick your hand out the hatch and grab a rock.
Looks like it's pretty low down there.
Well, when you're up here looking at where you are, it even looks lower.
I'll bet.
Hey, Challenger; America.
Okay, Challenger; America. Good luck on your PDI burn there. I'm going to track your landmark for you.
Okay, babe; have a good time, and go get that landmark.
Okay. Coming up on 30 seconds to T-2. Expect the Auto pitch rate, and remember, the good old Sun is going to be staring at you...
Beautiful results.
Oh, Houston, I got so excited on that, I forgot to turn the camera On.
Challenger, America. You want to try VHF Ranging - Ranging and Rendezvous Radar compare?
Okay. Transponder's On now.
Okay. There goes Reset. Now.
Ah-ha! it works! Point - 0.50 miles.
Okay.
Okay, 0.50 or 0.49 miles.
Okay, I'm going to turn the Ranging, Off, then. The comm's a little better that way.
Okay, Houston, you copying the 93?
Okay, Houston; America, ready to copy. PAD's here, and you have Accept.
Why don't I get started to the Verb 49 attitude, then I'll get the rest of the PADs, okay?
And, Houston; America here. While we're maneuvering, I'll go to Receive on the VHF, and you can send those PADs E to N up.
Okay, Jack, can you go to Receive only on your VHF there? I've got all these PADs to pick up now. I'll call you when - when I'm all through.
Okay, Challenger; America. I'm through with all the PADs now.
Challenger, America. You still with me?
Okay, I got something like "yup".
Okay, I just wanted to make sure - voice check if we still have the VHF comm.
Okay; loud and clear. How me, Jack?
Challenger, America. Read you loud and clear. How me?
Okay, America, we show you inside of 20 minutes, saying you have a Go for circ.
Houston, America. Roger. We'll do our best.
Okay, we're in burn attitude, and we don't have any sextant star check this time. And we're in P40; got a 58 10; align the old GDC.
Okay, GDC is aligned.
Stab Control and SPS breakers are Closed. Manual Attitudes are Rate Command.
Limit Cycle's Off. Deadband, Min. Rate to Low. Servo Power's in Rate Command.
Okay, Delta-VCG is in CSM. Gimbal Drive Pitch and Yaw is in Auto. Standing by for the bus ties.
Okay, America. About a minute until LOS. All systems look good. We'll see you on the other side with a good Circ.
Okay. Mighty fine.
America, Houston standing by.
Hey, Houston, this is America. Good burn.
The Noun 85's were plus 1.70 and a minus 0.6. They are trimmed out to 00 and a plus 0.1. Delta-VC was minus 10.0.
Also, Houston, I lost the landmark at 24:01 instead of 24:19.
Okay, America. We've taken one last look around your bird and it's looking good. So at least your half is Go for PDI.
And, America; Houston. We haven't watched you load P24 yet.
Yeah, that's a good point, I'll go ahead and get it.
Coming up on T-1.
Five seconds to T-2.
Hey, Challenger; this is America. I heard you all the way down. That's great. Beautiful.
And, America; we have a Stay for T-1.
