And, America, I have a Pan Camera photo PAD whenever you're ready for it. It'll go on page 129.
America, Houston. The LM has a Stay for T-2.
Okay. T-start: 114:03:11; T-stop: 114:33:18.
And, America, we're ready for the High Gain to Auto.
Okay. You have it.
Yeah. It's a good thing it's in the sextant because you can't see it in the telescope. Because the Earth is in the field of view.
Okay. If those look good to you, I'll torque at 20.
Okay, Houston; this is America. I think I'll go ahead and use a shaft to 00.12, and a 57.470.
Okay. Go on the H2 tank, thanks.
Okay. H2 Fans, number 1, Off.
Okay. It's all - it looks good, Ron.
And Rendezvous Transponder is Off.
Okay. Pan Camera Power is coming Off.
And the VHF is Off to Receive Only - is Off.
Okay. We're in Deploy/Retract. Circuit breakers are In.
SM/AC Power's On, and those circuit breakers are In. So 181's squared away.
Okay. Data System is going On.
IR is going On.
UV is going On. Okay. Let's open a few covers.
Okay. Mapping Camera. Laser Altimeter. Barber pole, and then a gray.
IR; barber pole, and a gray.
UV Cover; a barber pole, and a gray. And we'll try timing the old Mapping Camera. See how she does this time.
Mark it.
Okay. Got my clock running.
Still barber pole.
Mark it.
Okay. We wanted to take 11 into A, and stow number 9, which you're going to take out, into A-9.
Okay. The old lithium hydroxide canister's changed.
Okay. I'll give you Houston time. It's 14:35:21 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5.
Okay, America. We're about 3 minutes from LOS. All systems look good. And GNC has noticed that you've got the Optics not in Zero, and next time you're down that way, it would make everybody feel better if you'd put it there. It's not - not something that you have to do right away.
And a [garble] to that.
In degrees, minutes and seconds, the latitude has been pinned down to 20 degrees, 9 minutes, 50.5 seconds north; longitude 30 degrees, 46 minutes, 19.3 minutes - or seconds east, which is about 639 meters east of the designated landing point - the premission landing point. For those newsmen who have the landing site with the grid coordinates on it, that corresponds to DN.0 by 84.2. At 113:45 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
00 pm. To repeat, estimated Press Conference in about 20 minutes, approximately, 18 minutes to be exact, in the small Briefing Room in Building 1. Some 42 minutes away from acquisition as the Command Module, America, comes around on revolution 14. Meanwhile on the surface, to repeat the estimated landing site. It is right down the line on the Ground Track. However some 369 meters east or short of the predesignated, premission landing point.
America, Houston.
Just about to make it.
Map Camera is Standby.
America, Houston. We're reading you. How us?
Okay; just about have you, Houston. But not quite.
[Garble] vent's closed. Okay, Houston. This is America. Looks like we have you for good now.
Okay. Bus Ties are Off; Pyro Bus Ties are Open. Let's see about Bus A and B. I think those are Open. Yes, they're Open.
Okay; Relay Bus Bat B is Open - coming Open. Getting around to battery charger. Bat Charge to Alpha and then to Bravo. Both about 30.
Okay. Pan Camera Power is Off. And - let's see. Is the time for the Lunar Sounder stuff?
Okay. Lunar Sounder Operate is in Standby. Recorder is going On. Radar is going On. Recorder is gone Off. Off to center; not to Heaters. And the Mode is going to VHF.
High Gain to Auto.
Okay, America. We're ready for the HF Antenna Extend test, and, just for your information, White Sands got one of the rockets off. The other one was a No Go.
America, Houston. We'd like to try Antenna 1 again. We'd like you to go Extend for barber pole plus 3 seconds, then Off, then Retract.
Okay. HF for number 1 to Retract, now. And a barber pole.
Okay; it's Off, and the talkback is gray.
Ron, Houston here. On that one, we followed your Retract current in for 7 seconds, and then it went into stall; so it apparently is the track - it's retracting normally up to a point, and then goes into stall. We'd like you to press on and do Extend on HF Antenna 2. And we're going to press on here, probably thinking like maybe we won't get the antennas in. And on Antenna 2...
Okay. Number 2, Extend. Barber pole 1001, 1002. Off. Okay; number 2 going to Retract, now. Barber pole 1001, 1002. Hey! Okay; it went gray - and back to Off.
Okay. Recorder's going On. And we'll extend number 1. Let me get the clock going here. Okay; 3, 2, 1...
Mark it.
Hey, I think I can see a light spot down there on the landing site where they might have blown off some of that halo stuff.
Hey, it's gray now on the number 1 Extend.
Okay; number 2 is going to - it's Off. And number 2 is going to Extend.
Hey, I can see number 2.
Okay; we'll turn it off.
Probably dark down there. Mapping Camera to Off.
Okay; Mapping Camera to Standby. Laser Altimeter, Off. Image Motion, Off. Barber pole; gray.
Mapping Camera to Off.
Let's see. Pan Camera Self Test, Off. And it's after sunset. UV, Off. IR is Off. Data System is Off. SM/AC Power, we're going to get that Off. SM/AC Power is Off. Okay; it looks like 12. Lunar Sounder to Operate.
America, while we're waiting for this Lunar Sounder to operate for 2 minutes, could you - could you say again those coordinates you gave us. I dug out the map TL 25-8, and I got the 83.3, but what was the azimuth coordinate on that, Ron?
Mark it. Barber pole; gray.
Okay; she's Standby. Mode has gone to HF. I'll select, I'm going to need Bravo. Too bad. Do old High Gain, Manual and Wide. That's 12 and 211.
Okay; minus 12, 211. High Gain Antenna Power is Off. Bit Rate is Low. Okay; ready for the HF part of it?
Okay. Operate at 15. Barber pole and then a gray.
Sounder to Standby at 17.
Okay; Bit Rate - Bit Rate to High.
17:40, went to Operate.
18:40. Lunar Sounder, Standby.
Okay; we're maneuvering to VHF test attitude.
Okay, Houston. I'm about ready to press ahead, if you all are?
Okay. High Gain Antenna Power is On. We go to Manual and Wide. Minus about 12, and Yaw about 21 or something, 211. [Garble] on the High Gain. Ah-ha, Auto. Looks like it worked pretty good. Okay. Mode to VHF. Find it - there it is. Mode to VHF.
Operate.
Okay. It went to Standby at 30.
Mode is gone to HF. Recorder is Off. Lose a little comm here, huh? Maybe. Okay; there's Bravo. Select Omni. The High Gain at minus - Manual, Wide. Minus 10 and 25 for AOS.
Okay; good. And High Gain Antenna Power is going Off.
H2 tank 2 Fans are On, now.
Hey! You know, you'll never believe it. I'm right over the edge of Orientale. I just looked down and saw a light flash myself.
Just about to lose you.
Spacecraft real time; PCM and real time will not be received.
Okay, the old Recorder going On. VHF reminding myself that it's On. Recorder's to VHF. Sounder to Operate. Stand by for 1 minute. Okay. Tape recorder [garble] I'm sure. No, no, wait.
[Garble.] Stand by. Pull film for 1 minute. [Garble] 11 frames.
Okay, Houston. This is America. Looks like you're with me now.
Okay, I've got to switch to window number 3 for end of target. Say again, the target number.
Okay.
You know you look at - next to Macrobius A, there is a kind of a dark halo-type crater there. Very small one. And it doesn't have the appearance of a hummocky crater rim to it, at all. It looks like the material just kind of spreads out all over the area, but it doesn't have a hummocky appearance to it. I'm going to take a look at that again when I come back - on back around on the other side. There's a small mound down in the bottom of the crater, also. It's a domical-shaped structure in the bottom of that small crater. It's right next to J3. North of J3.
No, it still looks like that area that's blown away there is Dog November - between Dog November and Dog Papa. And about 83.4 or something like that.
Copy.
At your convenience, High Gain to Auto.
Okay.
Okay, Pan Camera Power - Let's see. Pan Camera Power is Off.
You know, it's funny. It wasn't as bright - That pass over - This last pass - as it was the time before.
I hope you haven't - I hope you haven't spilled any; and, by the way, LMP is on the surface now, too.
Okay, Mapping Camera is going to Standby. IM Pitch Motion is Off. Altimeter - Laser Altimeter - is Off. UV is Off. IR is Off. Okay, UV cover - box. UV Cover is Closed; barber pole, gray. IR Cover is Closed; barber pole, gray. Okay, Map Camera Laser Altimeter - we'll leave that one Open.
Bob, one little notice. Supplies I had this morning. Might made notes, so I wouldn't forget about it. It was when you go to tunnel vent, it takes a heck of a long time to vent that tunnel. In the simulator down there, you go to tunnel vent, and it flips right down and vents. And I was beginning to wonder if it - if it was leaking or something.
Roger; it's in the Flight Plan. But it's just before you're going to get busy on that orbital science photo. You might of - you might go to the window earlier or something.
Ron, you're 5 minutes to LOS here. And you're looking real good all around the room. No problems with any of the systems that we can see. We'll see it at 118:29. And we'll be with you for another 5 minutes here.
Roger.
You've got a Lunar Sounder HF pass at 1 - starting - at 119, for a site - well, actually a 2-hour, no, 1-hour that you could probably grab some food at that time.
America, Houston.
Okay. Magazine SS is full.
Okay. Good idea. Reacq and Narrow.
TEI-26, SPS/G&N; 37630; plus 0.53, plus 0.97; 139:41:14.32; Noun 81's plus 2450.7, minus 2097.8, minus 0807.1. Roll is 187; pitch, 104; yaw, 323; rest of the PAD is not applicable. Good old Sirius and Rigel for set stars; 133, 200, 030. Ullage, four jet, 12 seconds. Longitude of the Moon at TIG will be minus 160.39. Over.
Okay. Readback. TEI-26, SPS/G&N; 37630; plus 0.53, plus 0.97; 139:41:14.32; and 81's plus 2450.7, minus 2097.8, minus 0807.1. Roll 187, 104, 323. Sirius and Rigel; 133, 200, 030. Four jet, 12 seconds. Lunar longitude at TIG is minus 160.39.
Good readback, Ron. And the Earthshine photo PAD is at 121:05 in the Flight Plan.
And, Ron, we'd like the Recorder, On, on the Lunar Sounder.
Okay. Recorder, On.
Just talked to the homefront, Ron. And I guess some of you guys will do anything to get out of - get away from putting up...
Okay. Finally got mag ZZ on the ole Nikon.
Okay; 49. Omni Bravo. And set the High Gain Manual and Wide, minus 74.
Okay, Ron. We're - It looks like we're about 30 seconds in front of Operate. Right there on Operate.
Ron, when you get a chance, we'd like H2 Tank 3 Fan to Off.
Okay. H2 Tank 3 Fans are Off.
Ron, I know you're wondering. All the data so far on the Lunar Sounder has come out real good, and the HF pass is looking real good.
Gene became the first auto-mechanic on the Moon as one of the rear fenders fell off the Rover right after they deployed it, so he had to tape it on with some tape.
You can't pack them in there, you have to - yes...
Well, I can see Reiner Gamma real well out window 3.
Okay, I want to switch to window 3. A little better to try and get some pictures.
Okay, Ron. No [garble] for picture taking, but you need to select Omni A when you get a chance.
Well, I didn't see any slices down there that time.
Ron, you're about ready to go over the hill. You're looking really good.
Hello, Ron. How's it going up there?
Houston, America. The mag Lima Lima is on frame number 54 now.
Houston, America. I got to unplug you for a little bit. I'm so tangled up in my hoses here, I'm getting strangled to death.
Houston, do you need Omni Bravo yet? Will you give me a call when you want it?
...within the crater rim.
Okay. H2 tank 2 Fans to Off.
Well, South Massif just went into a hole, too, so...
Were you able to see the Sul- Sulpicius Gallus Ridge there, Ron?
Okay, Ron. You're about 2 minutes from T-start time, but again bias your T-start time with respect to the crater Eratosthenes.
Okay, Ron. You're about 30 seconds from T-start time.
Okay. I think I got her.
Mark it.
Mark it.
Mark it.
Hack it.
Mark it.
Hack it.
Hack.
Mark it.
Mark it.
Mark it.
Mark it. You probably should be able to see Encke out there now. That's your last target there.
Okay; will do.
Okay. Got her in sight now.
Okay, Ron. Did you get that mag finished up?
Omni Alpha.
Can you still see - see things in Earthshine or is it getting pretty black down there?
Okay; that's my last picture off.
Oh, okay.
Houston, America. [Garble].
Thank heavens.
Ron, are you out - glued to a window, or are you just eating now?
Okay, Houston; America. Bat C is about, oh, 36.8 or 9, something like that [cough].
Pyro A is 37.
Pyro - okay. Pyro A is 37; Pyro B is 37. Bat C is oh, 36.9. Okay. I think you want the quads now, [garble].
Okay. Alpha is 82. Bravo - a 78. Charlie is 80. Delta is - about 83.
Okay. Tank 2 Fans are going On. H2, that is.
And, Ron, we'd like Omni Bravo.
Okay. You have Omni Bravo.
Ron, you're less than a minute to Lunar Sounder, Operate and Standby.
Mark it.
You can go Recorder, Off, now, Ron.
Okay. Recorder - is Off.
Okay. Radar's coming Off, Data System is coming On.
High Gain Antenna is going to Power.
Manual, Wide.
74, 280.
Okay. SM/AC Power is coming On.
Mapping Camera is Standby. Self test to heaters.
UV is On. IR is On.
[Cough] UV Cover is going Open. Barber pole and a gray.
IR is Open. Barber pole and a gray.
Ron, if you're finished there, we would like the - Accept. We got to get on monitor load, and we got a state vector for you tonight.
Okay. You have Accept.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay. I checked out the tone booster, and it's hooked up.
Well, I guess I'd better chlorinate the old water.
Hey, Ron. You can go to Block. The computer's yours.
Are we going to leave tank 3 - I mean, tank 2, H2 Fan, On, all the time?
Rog. H2 tank 2 Fan, On, for all night.
Only thing we've got, Ron, is it looks like you've got to get the Bat B off the Charge and then - configure the comm, and you are all ready to bed down.
Okay. Battery B relay's breakers In. Charger's Off.
Ron, we just been debating here; you need to be sure to do the knobs at the minus 10 and plus 25.
Ron, everything's looking great down here. It was a really great day, really busy. We're sorry about that eat period; and it's been real - lot of - lot of things accomplished.
Ron, just a reminder on the S-Band Normal, Voice, Off, when you're ready to - back out.
Okay, Ron. We're going to drop the up-link here in 1 minute, so see you tomorrow.
[Garble] Voice is going Off. You can call me, but I can't call you. [Laughter.]
