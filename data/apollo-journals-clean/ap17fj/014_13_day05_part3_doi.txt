Gray? Gee, that was a minute and 30 seconds.
Oh, yes. Manual and Wide. 2 Minus 5, 15.
Yes, Omni Delta.
It's Standby.
It's Stereo.
It's Power now.
Okay. Power.
Okay. High Altitude.
Okay. Then the next things we're going to do - Don't do them yet - are Laser Altimeter, On; then Image Motion, On; then Mapping Camera, On; and Pan Camera - I'll give you a T-start on it. And then Image Motion, Increase...
Oh, there.
Okay. We're rounded out a little bit more now...
Okay. Let's see. We got another minute or so. Ron, yours is f/2.8 at 1/250, infinity.
Okay. Laser Altimeter, On.
On.
Another 2 minutes for the Mapping Camera.
I'll cue you on time. Oh, that's Korolev with that big central - that ridge. It's really a - I don't think you can quite see Korolev yet.
Mapping Camera, On.
Yes.
Yes. Laser...
Yes.
Yes.
Okay, it's On now.
Okay. We've got about a minute to go for the Pan Camera.
I'll give you a Pan Camera start here. I don't know...
Operate.
Okay. Barber pole. 1, 2, 3, 4.
This is Doppler right here in front of you.
Okay, just before you get to it, there's a little crater. See this little crater at the left of it here at - as you look at it, at 7 o'clock?
Okay, Ron. You ought to be about f/4, I'd say.
Okay, 5 minutes.
Jack, on your side, you ought to have McKellar coming up there in the foreground a ways. It's - it's pretty subtle on that side, isn't it?
Okay, just as you go past Crookes, you can go to 5.6.
Ron, you want to hold 5 - 5.6 now...
Okay. And f/8 is about - you want to stay - stay at 5.6. Right?
Ron, I'd say that's Daedalus over there.
Mark it. Low Altitude. What's my next one, Gene? You got anything?
f/8. Okay.
Okay, this is Aitken. Got Aitken.
Yes, f/8 is still good.
So I might be a little bit ahead of you, because I can see these things before you could, but you're coming up on - on Heaviside and - and Keeler now.
Here's a good example of a crater hitting the wall, guys, where the material apparently slumped down into it, and it's now a - has a linear bottom rather than a cone bottom. You get the impression that this part back here has been powdered almost everywhere except...
Oh, okay. There's Gagarin.
That crater in Keeler there is the one that Jim Lovell used as the landmark track, down on the north rim.
In the - in the central peak in Keeler, you can see some ridges right across the top of the mountainous ridge that are running in a - lineations running in a east-west trend. See that, Jack?
There's a population of elongate craters - looks something like the highland version of your sea. Every once in a while, you see those kind of craters.
Oh, there's the Star Chaplygin, Ron. See it? Out here?
Man, the Star looks - is just a very dense white halo within about a - looks like a half a crater diameter. And inside, you can see very dark masses streaked by very light masses in a - in a radial downward direction.
Okay. I can't see Gagarin, no. What's this, Chap - Chaplygin here - with the...
I just lost it.
Well, I thought it had some stuff on the crater floors, but I sure don't see it. Oh, there it is! Yes, I got it right here.
Jack, you got another minute on the Pan Camera.
Mark it.
Okay. It's going to High.
We're right here, Ron.
We're supposed to have those big - Oh, there it goes. Yes, out over here. Yes. Okay. There it goes. Boy, I tell you, it sure helps to have...
Yes, what's that one that has the slumping down there south of - of Green?
This is where you get your back sore.
What is that? Do you have any idea? Big long chain?
Yes, it's a Y-shaped central peak is the...
Okay. Laser Altimeter is Off and going just to Retract...
Okay. Barber pole.
IR to Close.
IR is Closed...
UV is Closed.
Pan Camera to Operate at 18:05. It's 17:05 now. Coming down.
No, no, just leave it there, but I'd just like to know when it is.
Mark. It's operating.
I can't find A-4. My eyeballs are shot. A-4, enabled.
A-1 and C-2, okay. A/C Roll is Off.
Okay, Ron. Now we're coming over Lobachevsky, right now. Right here.
Frame 66. That's a really strange - those are very light gray areas that are around the rims of craters. Looks like it might be related to that swirl.
Mapping Camera, Retract. The talkback was gray.
Okay. We're in Omni Delta.
Okay, Houston. We're with you in Omni Delta.
that is much darker than the others...
Roger, Ron. Read you loud and clear.
Okay, Robert. We should have gotten everything right on up through AOS here in the Flight Plan.
Good show.
And the Pan Camera should be running right now.
Okay, Houston. America here. We stopped the orbital photo path, frame 59. And at about the sub-stellar point, we took 59 to 66, and frame 67 was taken of the, oh, the dark slide on the corner of Lobachevsky.
What have we got coming up there, Jack?
Roger, America.
Those frames that Ron mentioned - this is Jack - that he mentioned were taken of a area where there's a much lighter gray albedo. Rather than the tannish gray, it's pure gray material that generally is on the rim crest of a number of craters. It may be related to the swirls that we see elsewhere.
Roger, Jack.
Did you go High Gain yet? Three minutes.
Okay. 42, 43, Pan Camera, Stop.
Bob, we're...
Pan Camera, Off, on cue.
Roger, America. We're tracking you on the map here, watching it.
Okay.
Al-Biruni has got a - variations in the - in its floor, variations in albedo. It almost looks like a pattern as if water were flowing on a beach. It's that irregular. Not in great areas, but in small areas around on the southern side, and the part that looks like it's a water-washing pattern is of a much lighter albedo, although I cannot see any real source for it. The texture, however, looks about the same.
Roger, Jack.
And Houston, America. For your info, it took an hour - an hour - a minute and 45 seconds for the map - your Mapping Camera to extend and a minute and 45 for it to retract.
Roger, Ron. Copy. 1:45, extend and retract.
Bob, what's our altitude now?
Looks like you're crossing - you're just about 90 miles, but we'll firm that up here, Gene. You're 90.8...
Okay.
America.
Okay; thank you.
Bob, this is Jack. And the question of these irregular swirls that we've got in Mare Marginis, and we are looking just north of Nep - Neper now. I tell you, in the mare, there just is no visible relief. Although there seem to be some sinuous systematics anyway to the distribution. Like, there'll be a very dark area associated with the light area. And that dark area is darker than the mare. I think the pictures will show that. Now, in the highlands, however, the - the light albedo areas, which are very comparable, that appear to be swirl-like patterns of the same type, seem to be associated with a crest of crater ridges and other high points. We're on over - right over a concentration of these now in the northern part of Marginis, where the rule of a - of the light areas being associated with a - either - either symmetrically around a much darker area than the normal mare, or on one side, and in this case, generally the south side - of a dark area is - that rule is very clear. And that also seemed to hold in the back side that there was a slightly darker region between areas of light-colored swirls.
Roger, Jack. We understand, and we're standing by. We have a DOI PAD and some other updates.
Okay. We'll go back to work.
America, Houston. We'd like Pan Camera, Off.
You're reading our minds, Bob.
It's Off.
Roger.
It's off.
Pan Camera'S Off, and we'd like Accept. We've got the DOI target load, the CSM state vector, PIPA - and an SPS tailoff constant.
Okay; you've got Accept, Bob.
Roger, Gene. And there will be no PIPA bias.
Okay.
Bob, I can start with that PAD if you want to.
Roger. We're standing by. I'll start with DOI-1. Are you ready to copy?
Go ahead.

Good readback, Jack.
Okay. What else can we do for you?
Stand by 1, here. I've got an addition for Ron on that comment about that F Crater landmark. Let me get it. It's right here, and I'll come right up to Ron on it.
Okay; I'll stand by.
Ron, this additional comment will have - the crater is 8 nautical miles north of your track. You will lose the landmark at a 36-degree elevation angle. Over.
Okay. It's 8 miles north, and I'll lose it at 30 degrees. Okay; so that'll be pretty quick.
Thirty-six degrees; pretty quick still.
Is that the one on Family Mountain?
Stand by on that, Ron. Let me look at the book here. And I'll get Farouk to help me out on that one.
Okay, Houston. I've got F Crater, now. I'm all squared away. Thank you.
Okay, Ron. It's - it's right in the middle of that landing site 4 of 4 which is right before Ignin in the book on your - on the Landmark Tracking Book. And it's right dead center on that page.
Okay, I've got it now. I wrote down 404; it's 4 of 4.
Okay, Houston. We've got a good shot of the landing site.
Rog. Understand. And Roger, Ron.
The shadows, Bob, go all the way across the Scarp and very long pyramiding shadows go all the way past Family Mountain. It looks like the Sculptured Hills are lit up on this side, but it almost puts the entire North Massif in shadow, from where I stand.
America, Houston.
Quite an interesting place to land down there.
America, Houston.
We can now, I think, see contrast down in the shadow. And the only part of the scarp that's visible - I think Jack picked it out - as being right where Lara is.
Roger. America, Houston.
Roger; go ahead.
Roger. Just some words in your - You'll be going through your systems checklist here and you'll probably see that it says dump the waste water if it's greater than 85 percent and you are at about 89.6 percent. We'd - we'd like you not to dump the waste water until the nominal time in the Flight Plan. Do not dump the waste water during this systems check. Over.
Okay, and I understand that was about 94 hours as I recall.
That's affirmative. That's where the nominal time is and that is where we'd like it dumped.
Okay.
Bob, that's a - a fantastic black-and-white shot of the landing area with the shadow stretching across most of it.
Roger. Understand.
Bob, I can now see down in through the shadow. I can see - Bear Mountain, I can see - I can't really make out the - the slide yet. Most of the North Masstif - Massif are still in shadow due to the - due to the Sculptured Hills. And just at the point where we can start really to see through the shadows and see the - some hummocky terrain on the North Massif, it just went out of my next reach. But, I did see some sort of albedo change that went across the canyon about in the vicinity of the - of the scarp.
Bob, with respect to the landing site - this is Jack - when we had near - or were closer to low phase angle, approaching it - when I first had it in view - there was a clear lightening in the area of the light mantle. It was not sharply defined, but around the crater Lara and Nansen and to the west of the scarp - there was very clearly, slightly brighter - reflectivity.
Roger, Jack.
Houston, America. The Mapping Camera and Laser Altimeter covers are Closed. I'm going to Enable A-1, A-2, and C-2.
Roger, Gene.
Yeah, it looks like the old gravity gradient worked there or something. I didn't see it get out of attitude at all. Did you all see any movement at all?
Max error was about 0.2 - 0.3 of a degree, Ron.
Okay.
I'm sorry, Houston. I should have cued you on changing the SPS pressure indicators. You want to see that again?
Stand by on that.
Jack, it's not required to go back and do them again. We watched it on telemetry.
Okay. I'll try to remember to be a little more informative.
No problem, Jack; no problem.
Okay, Houston. There are the torquing angles.
Roger. We see them. They look good.
Just for another little matter of interest - once the Earth is in the field of view, which it's about - looks like it must be about 12 degrees from Regulus - it's so bright, that it blacks out any - blanks out the telescope for any star recognition. However, it worked real good, in the sextant. You can see the star real well. You just have to assume it's Regulus, though.
Roger. Would that star angle difference...
Okay, I'll torque at 30.
I torqued at 30 - 09:30.
Roger. We copy.
And the first - the first star angle difference was - you know, you can get a little bit lax about it - if you want to spend a little time at it, you can get five balls every time, looks like.
Rog, Ron. With that star angle difference on the second one, I can assume it was Regulus. I think you're safe in your assumption.
Oh, yeah. Right.
He had to do it, or else I'd have to go down there and do it.
Roger.
America, Houston. P40 looks good.
Okay. Mighty fine; we'll go ahead and maneuver to attitude then.
Roger.
Houston, I think I've put the wrong number in on the Pitch. We'll correct it. It's 228, isn't it?
That's affirmative, Gene.
Okay, we'll fix that.
America, Houston. We'd like the High Gain to Auto.
You've got it.
Roger.
America, Houston. We'd like you to hold off switching to Omni Charlie until we cue you on that.
Wilco.
Bob, this is Jack.
Go ahead, Jack.
Was there any indication on the seismometers of an impact, about the time I thought I saw a light flash on the surface?
Stand by that - we'll check on that, Jack.
Don't worry about it. Some - I thought somebody was looking at it. It could have been one of the other light flashes.
Rog. We copied the time and...
I have a place marked.
passed it to the back room.
Okay, I got it marked on the map, too.
Okay, Bob. The star sextant checks out okay.
Roger, Gene. Good show.
America, Houston. You are Go for DOI and you can leave the High Gain selected. We're holding good.
Okay, Robert. DOI. the High Gain.
Ro - Gene, say again. You were way down in the mud on that one. Can you say again, please?
Roger; understand. We are Go for DOI, and you have the High Gain.
That's affirmative, Gene. Just...
Hey, Bob, I know I've argued against this kind of thing, but you got tenths on that burn time?
It's 0.1 on that.
Okay, 0.1.
Jack, just some words from the back room on you. The - There may have been an impact at the time you called, but the Moon is still ringing from the S-IVB impact. So it's masked any other - would mask any other impact. So they may be able to strip it out at a later time, but right now they don't see anything at your called time.
Just my luck.
Bob, log us for a picture of the Earth at 92:40 on mag Oscar Oscar. And we're on frame 68.
Roger, Jack; we've got that.
You've got a lot of healthy weather out there in the Pacific today. Looks like most of those things we talked about yesterday, up in the Hawaii region and also in the south, have intensified.
Roger.
America, Houston. We're about 3 minutes until LOS and everything is looking great. No changes since our Go for DOI. We'll expect to see you at 93:34:24.
We'll see you at 93:34:24, Bob.
Roger, Gene.

Yes, but there's a whole bunch of them right between there, and I want - Let me take one more look at that now.
Yes. I've got the whole back side, essentially.
These guys are Italian. How high are those mountains in that central peak?
Okay. There's a dark halo, and then there's a bright one.
Okay, Gene, as soon as I finish this P24, you can give me those - those new Noun 89s to load up.
I've got it right here. You want it? No, this is not the Flight Plan; this is...
Whereabouts are we, Jack? I don't have a map.
We're 107 degrees west now - east, 107 east. And AOS is like - - like in 1 minute. I'm sorry, like in 3 minutes - 3 minutes.
Well, we are - our field of view is.

There's Al-Biruni, isn't it?
Hello, Houston; America.
America, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. The burn was good on all counts, 22-second burn. It was on time, VGX, 1982; roll after the burn, 357, 225, and 003. Residuals were plus 0, plus 0.2, and plus 0.1.
