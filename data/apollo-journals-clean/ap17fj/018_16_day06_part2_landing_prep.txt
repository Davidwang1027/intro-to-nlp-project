Forward. Command Reset.
Simplex. Okay, Challenger; America. I need a. I'm going to to you.
Turn off your Vox.
It's verified, Ron.
Yes. Sure am, Ron.
Ron, is the tunnel vented yet?
Oh, what the heck was that? The O2 Flow just went up for some reason. Suit Circuit return or open. That did it.
You got about l0 minutes to go.
Okay.
Okay. It's a flight trim for P41.
Okay. Stand by. Twenty - something seconds yet. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
Mark it.
You're backing off; we're free.
Okay. I'm maneuvering now.
Hello, Houston. Challenger? Hello, Houston. Challenger?
Hello, Challenger; Houston. You're very, very weak. Over.
Okay, Houston. Challenger checkout is complete and we're looking at America, the beautiful.
Okay, Geno, I understand you're undocked. But we're not reading, but about 10 percent of what you're saying. Standby.
America, Houston; standing by.
Okay, Houston. This is America. We're floating free out here. The Challenger looks real pretty. The residuals on the P41 were plus 1.9, minus 0.2, and 0. Undock and sep was on time.
Sounds good.
Houston, this is Challenger. Won't hold on the steerable antenna yet. It looks like I'm getting oscillations in my uplink signal strength, and then it gradually drops off to zero.
Okay, Jack. We're reading you better now. Understand.
Okay, Gordo. If you're reading, you got the words. We are undocked. Landing radar self test was Go. We're ready to press on to the DPS throttle check, and we've been looking at America, the beautiful. It's rare form.
Okay, Geno. We've got that. It sounds good.
Okay, and the residuals on P47 at undocking were 0, minus 0.1, and 0.
Okay. We copy that. We'd like you to try the steerable again.
Okay, Houston; we've got it.
Okay. You sound real good; loud and clear.
Okay, let me give you some Noun 20 angles, if you want them.
Go ahead. Ready to copy.
The LM: plus 301.09, plus 284.53, plus 359.48; the CSM: plus three zeros.35, plus 104.67, plus 000.52; the time: 110:24:00. Over.
Okay, Jack. We got that.
Okay, Gordo; we're ready. DPS throttle check. I'm ready to hit Engine Stop.
Stand by. Okay; we're ready.
Okay. And the light is on. The Reg light is On.
Roger. We're showing the Engine Arm circuit breaker may be out. Would you check that?
Okay. I'm sorry, Gordy. A little - We missed that here. Okay, we'll try it again.
America, Houston. When you have an opportunity, how about cycling the High Gain to Wide and back to Reacq?
Okay, Can do.
Thank you, sir.
Okay, America. How about going back to Narrow on the antenna. And could you verify what you loaded on Noun 34? It went by so fast on the downlink, we didn't get it a chance to look at it.
Gordy, if the throttle test looked okay, I'll go Engine Arm Off.
Okay. It looked real good. Go ahead.
There, you got it?
Okay. That looks good.
Does that look okay?
Yes, sir. Sure does.
Okay. No update then, huh?
That's correct.
Okay.
Okay, Gordy, the Master Arm is coming on.
Roger.
I got two good lights.
Two lights.
Okay; on my mark. Descent Prop Isol Valve. 3, 2, 1...
Mark it. We heard it.
Roger.
Okay; looks good.
Gordy, there was a slight upward - Gordy, there was an upward fluctuation in pressure in the manifold when we fired that. It's back to where it was, prefiring.
Okay. That's what it should have done, Jack.
Okay, Helium Press, Descent Start. 3, 2, 1...
Mark it. We got it.
Okay; looks good onboard. About 240 both sides.
Okay; looks good on the ground.
Say, Gordy, this thing sounds a little bit like my stomach sounded a couple of days ago.
Roger that.
AGS coming on to Standby.
Okay. Master Alarm and AGS light.
Okay, 10 110:52:00 for the time on the AGS.
Roger, Jack.
Geno, we show Jack's Suit Isol valve in Suit Disconnect. Should be in Suit Flow. Would you check that for - for us, please?
Yeah. He's in Suit Flow now.
Okay. Thank you.
I'll tell you - I'll tell you, this LCG sure makes a world of difference up here.
Roger.
Hey, America; Challenger.
Hey, Ron; listen. This ridge you're coming on over - just stick your hand out the hatch and grab a rock.
Looks like it's pretty low down there.
Well, when you're up here looking at where you are, it even looks lower.
I'll bet.
Challenger; Houston. I have a new AGS K factor for you.
Stand by a second.
Go with the K factor.
Okay; it's 109:59:59.94. Over.
109:59:59.94.
That's right.
Gordo, this is spectacular. It is absolutely spectacular looking at that Command Module America down there coming across the surface. We're just tracking him at about a 30-degree dive angle.
Sounds great.
Okay, babe; have a good time, and go get that landmark. Don't forget - No TEIs. See you in about 3 days.
Geno, Houston, with a couple of items.
Go ahead, Gordo.
Okay. Your perilune seems to be...
Hey, we got the landing site, Gordo.
Okay. I'll hold...
Gordo, we got the landing site. We're coming right over the front of it. Stand by a minute. You can see the Slide. I think you can see the Great Cross.
Roger.
We'll get a picture of America coming right across it.
All righty.
Super targeting.
Gosh, we've got Family Mountain; we've got - of course - the Massif; we can see the Scarp; we can see the light mantle; I've got the Great Cross, Camelot, Sherlock.
Believe it or not, Houston, they're all there.
How about that.
I see possible structure - possible structure in the upper part of the South Massif, little bit east of Station 2. It's subhorizontal, dipping to the southeast.
Houston, I can even see Poppy, right where we're going to set this baby down.
Very good.
As a matter of fact, I can see Rudolph. I can even see the triangle: Rudolph, Frosty, and Punk. Man, Gordo, this is absolutely spectacular.
Sure sounds like it.
We can watch Ron track - we can watch Ron track right on through the landmarks. I don't know what kind of results he got, but he sure had a nice smooth track from here.
Roger.
Gordo, you can go ahead and update us with those words.
Okay. Your perilune is shifting west. PDI will be a little higher than nominal: 10.7 miles or 65,000 feet; should be no problem. And, from the time you first came around until we had a solid lockup on the steerable on this acquisition was about 3 minutes. We're going to try to speed that up some on the next time around. We'd like you to just keep trying the steerable until we come to you - and say, "stop trying." Over.
Okay, Gordy, understand that; and apparently this time, had I let it - had I waited a little longer, it would have dropped to zero and then come up, because that's what happened when I finally got you. I'll give it more time next time.
Okay.
And, Jack, I've got lots of PADs for you whenever you're ready.
Okay, Gordy; go with the PADs.
Okay. The first one is a P76 with a CSM circ.
Go.
Okay. Noun 33 is 111:57:30.09; Noun 84: plus 0070.5, plus five zeros, and minus 0000.5. Go ahead.
Okay. 111:57:30.09; plus 0070.5, plus all zeros, minus four zeros 5.
Okay. Good readback. Next one I have is the No-PDI plus 12 abort, item Echo.
Go ahead.
Okay. Echo is 113:02:00.00; Foxtrot, plus 0103.4, plus five zeros, minus 0050.0; Noun 42: 0142.0, plus 0005.4, 0114.9; burn time is 0:48; 000, 272; 373...
Okay. Just a second. Give me a transponder, and we'll start with the radar. Jack's tied up right now.
373 is 0182.0; AGS Delta-Vs: plus 0103.7, plus five zeros, minus 0049.3; Golf, 113:57:00.00; Hotel, 11 - I'll start over - 115:36:45.00; and the No-DOI-2 Delta-VX, 0096.6. Two remarks: throttle profile is 10 percent for 26 seconds, 40 percent for the rest of the burn. Over.
Okay, readback. 11 - No-PDI plus 12 - 113:02 all zeros; plus 0103.4, plus all zeros, minus 0050.0; 0142.0, plus three zeros 5.4, 0114.9; 0:48; all zeros, 272; 0182.0; plus 0103.7, plus all zeros, minus 0049.3; 113:57 all zeros; 115:36:45.00; 0096.6; remarks: throttle profile 10 percent for 26 seconds; 40 percent for the remainder.
Okay, that's a good readback. Item India: 112:49:52.35...
Say, Gordo.
Go ahead.
Gordo, Gordo. Hey, Gordo; stand by. We want to finish the radar VHF test; and when I go to P52, you can finish the PADs.
Okay.
Okay. We're in VHF Ranging, and I've got you on radar, Ron. We'll be quiet for a second and see if you can get a lockon.
Ah-ha! it works! Point - 0.50 miles.
Okay.
Okay, 0.50 or 0.49 miles.
Okay, Gordo. The VHF ranging and radar checks out very well.
Okay, sounds good. Tell me when you're ready for item India again.
We cut you off, Ron.
Okay, I'm going to turn the Ranging, Off, then. The comm's a little better that way.
Go ahead, Gordy.
Okay. India is 112:49:52.35; 11:01, plus 0002.2; attitude is 002, 108, 290; plus 56900, Juliet: 115:36:45.00; Kilo: 117:35:45.00. Go ahead.
Okay. It's a PDI PAD; 112:49:52.35; 11:01, plus three zeros 2.2; 002, 108, 290; plus 56900; Juliett, 115:36:45.00; Karen, 117:35:45.00. Go ahead.
Okay, that's a good readback. Lima is 113:14:24.91; Maytro, 119:34:30.00; and November is 114:57:19.09; And your T-2 at PDI - T-2 will be at PDI plus 24:33.
24:33?
That's affirmative.
Okay, Linda is 113:14:24.91; Mary is 119:34:30.00, and Nancy is 114:57:19.09.
That's a good readback.
Okay, one thing left, Jack, is the SHe pressures on the PDI page.
Go ahead.
Okay; at TIG, the pressure will be 1310; plus 1 minute, 1410; 2 minutes, 1400; 3 minutes, 1310; and 4 minutes, 1230. Over.
Okay, I got those. Thank you.
Roger.
You're loud and clear.
Roger, America. Have a good burn. You look just as pretty in earthlight as you do in sunlight.
We see that. Looks like a good job.
Yeah, but it's not an easy one, Gordo.
to Receive only. Hey, Challenger; America.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jack, can you go to Receive only on your VHF there? I've got all these PADs to pick up now. I'll call you when - when I'm all through.
Okay, Receive only. We got your Go, Gordo?
That's affirmative, torque them.
Challenger, we need Aft Omni and select the steerable to Slew. And Low bit rate.
Challenger, select Forward Omni, please.
Okay, Gordo, the COAS alignment's good and the DAP is reset.
Okay, and like the rest of the spacecraft, the platform's beautiful, there's no drift compensation or PIPA bias update. Over.
Beautiful. It's kind of like a
Like to give you one update, you can write it in the Timeline, page 8; the T-1 time is PDI plus 17:00. Over.
Okay; T-1 is PDI plus 17:00, we got it.
Roger.
Okay, Houston, you got P00 and Data.
Okay.
Gordo, can I start maneuvering to the AGS cal while you're getting those updates - uplinks ready?
Okay, we'd like the steerable back again. Try Pitch of minus 25, and Yaw of minus 72.
Okay; you got the steerable.
Okay, we need High bit rate.
We're starting the uplinks now. We'll get that in before we go to the AGS cal attitude. Over.
Okay, Gordo, I've got - I've got the Earth and the direction I have to maneuver is nothing but good for the high gain, so I'll start over slowly.
Okay.
Challenger, Houston. It's your computer. Up-data link off.
Roger.
Still with you.
Okay, I got something like "yup".
Say again, Ron.
Okay, I just wanted to make sure - voice check if we still have the VHF comm.
Okay, I'll have to give you another one here in a minute.
Okay, how do you read?
Okay; loud and clear. How me Jack?
You're loud and clear.
Challenger, America. Read you loud and clear. How me?
Okay, America, we show you inside of 20 minutes, saying you have a Go for circ.
Houston, America. Roger. We'll do our best.
Challenger, Houston. You're Go for DOI-2.
Thank you, Gordo, We're Go here for DOI-2.
Okay, Houston, did you get the AGS cal numbers?
Challenger, that's affirmative.
Okay, it all looks pretty good to me. 546 may have been a little more than specs, but it looks pretty good.
Okay, looks good here.
Jack, have you got to an Omni? If you have, go Low Bit Rate.
Okay, We've got you on an Omni and Low Bit...
Okay.
57:28. The Lunar Module DOI, or Descent Orbit Insertion burn number 2 also will be behind the Moon before we reacquire the spacecraft. That is scheduled for 112 hours, 2 minutes, 40 seconds. It's a fairly small burn of 7.6 feet per second, which will lower the pericynthion of Challenger down to 6½ miles - nautical miles with apocynthion staying at 61.5 nautical miles. During the next front side pass, comes the moment of truth with powered descent, and touchdown at Taurus-Littrow landing site as Challenger lights off the big descent engine at 112 hours, 49 minutes, 52 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. The ignition countdown clock in the control center is counting down to PDI, some 59 minutes, 17 - 16 seconds until ignition with landing shortly under 12 minutes later, depending on the amount of hover time available. The broadcast line will be brought up again just prior to Acquisition of Signal as America and Challenger come around on the front side again on revolution 13. And at 111 hours, 51 minutes; this is Apollo Control.
Ron, do you still read us?
I got that part. Loud and clear.
Mark it.
Okay. Bat Bus B - AC. That's slow coming up any minute. good shape.
Okay. Helium valves in Auto - N2A. Servo Power, 1; got it; 2's going on. Okay. controller's at AC. Directs are Off. BMAGs are uncaged. No hardovers. Go to SCS. Okay. Pitch 1;
Okay. MTVC - TVC, MTVC - TVC. Looking good. Okay. Neutral, returns to zero. Okay, no MTVC. AC/DC on the old Power. Put up the Directs. Cage the old BMAGs. Okay. BMAGs are Rate 2. DSKY Release. 50 18, Proceed. 18. The 50 18 says we're there. Uncage the old BMAGs, and there's the 50 18.
1, 2, 3, 4, - ah-ha! We have drift. Plus 0.4; plus 0.9; 3 minutes and 60 seconds to go.
59.9. The Delta-VC burn time was 4 seconds. burn time plus 1. Manual with the Directs On. burn.
Okay. is Normal. Control Power is Off. Delta-V plus 8. before I take another. Okay. Average g. is on. You guys still hear me? Challenger, America. Do you read?
Okay. At 17 seconds. There's ullage. We have ullage. 99 Proceed. Oh-ho! down! Ho - Ho! burn.
Mark.
Okay. Burn is complete. And all good residuals.
Ron, we're 210 from the burn.
And we're burning right at the terminator, Ron.
Okay.
Okay. We'll update the state vector.
21 minutes until we.
Okay, A.
Okay. PDI. unless you want to say something. call you.
Okay, Challenger, you're loud and clear on the Omni. How did it go?
Okay, The burn was Go. We're in a 7-mile perigee on the PGNS, and we had 0, plus 0.1 and plus 0.1 residuals.
Okay, sounds good.
Ok - Okay, Gordy, I'm going to try the high gain I had you locked up once, and then I lost you. Let me try it again.
We concur. Go ahead, Jack.
Okay, Gordy, that's my fault. I didn't know you were uplinking. You've got the Omni, and I'll leave it.
Okay, we'll stay on the Omni for the uplink.
Okay, Gordy, ED Bats are 37.2, both batteries. The ascent battery On time was 112:19:00, about 4 minutes late.
Okay, Jack. Copy.
Jack, we want Battery 3, Off for preconditioning.
Roger.
Challenger, we'd like you to verify that the...
And we did, Gordy.
is egress.
That's verified.
Roger.
And do you have a 231 update?
Stand by. Negative. No change, Jack.
Roger.
Okay, Gordo, how do you read CDR on Vox?
CDR, you're loud and clear on Vox.
Okay. How do you read the LMP on Vox?
Loud and clear, Jack.
Okay. Gordo, up until this time, the bird has looked beautiful - perfectly plain. All the check's have come out just as advertised.
Okay, sounds good.
And we're looking at 9 minutes and 5 seconds from PDI.
Challenger, do you see a Verb 33 out of DSKY? If you do, Enter it.
Okay, it's there, and I will Enter.
Roger.
Okay, it took; and I'm showing P00.
Okay. Your computer; the uplink's in.
Okay, we've got a tone on the upvoice backup.
Roger.
Verb 47 coming in at you, Jack. Okay, hit it. Okay, I got it. 240 - wait - 231, 569, 00, that's supposed to be. Okay, 569, 00 240s are the same - 569, 00.
Okay.
Okay, 254 is plus 01944.
Okay.
Okay, 262 is minus 00143. Okay, 400 plus 3, and I'll watch it.
How's it look?
It's - it's had that all the way along - a little bit of roll bias.
Okay. That's good. 400 plus 1.
400 plus 1 is in.
Okay, and we do have your needle. We do have your needle.
Okay.
Okay, and there's Verb 83 looking at you.
My Crosspointers are Low Mult for you.
Okay, and there's Verb 83. Give me a 317 and a 440.
Challenger, Houston. We'd like you to try the high gain once more. Pitch is minus - Pitch is zero and Yaw plus 59.
Are you happy with this, Jack? Let me 63.
Yes. Go ahead.
Okay.
That's good.
Gordy, understand no Noun 68 prior to P63 or Noun 69, right?
That's affirmative.
you need to ask him anything, I'll try the high gain.
No. Go ahead; try it.
Try the high gain, Gordy.
Okay.
Okay, it's locked up in Auto.
Roger.
And, Gordy, be advised that you're clipping on your first word.
Okay, Jack. We'd like you to set 410 in the AGS to all balls. Plus all balls.
That's 410, 410 not 400. Check that again.
That's affirmative; 410.
Thank you, Gordy.
You better go back and check 400 now.
It's okay. I fixed it.
Okay.
Oh, man, are we down among them, babe! Whooh!
Challenger, Houston. I have a PDI TIG update. It's 112:49:51.87. And Noun 61 cross range should be a plus 2.8. Over.
Okay. Say the seconds again on the PDI.
PDI seconds are 51.87. Over.
Okay. And the cross range?
Cross range is - is a plus 2.8. Over.
Okay, Gordy. That clock checks with - with our time out of P63. The Landing Radar breaker's In, I've got altitude, velocity, power. We're coming up on 4 minutes.
I'll give you the final trim at 4.
Okay.
Challenger, Houston. You're Go for PDI.
Oh, thank you, Gordy. We are Go up here for PDI; doing the final trim at 4.
Hello, America. Do you read Challenger?
Yes, that's a good point, I'll go ahead and get it.
Hey, Jack, you can check your watch.
Okay.
At 2 minutes, I'll get the Master Arm.
All right.
30 seconds, I'll get the Engine Arm; and we'll watch the PGNS tapemeter pick up average G. If you give me a Go on the ullage, I'll back up the ullage.
Okay.
And I'll back up the Start.
Challenger, should we lose the steerable,...
You get the steerable.
go Forward Omni.
Roger. Forward Omni.
down a little bit.
Okay, 02:41.
Okay, we picked it all up. Power still good.
Okay. Coming up on 2 minutes; I'm changing over here.
Okay.
Master Arm, On. Two minutes.
Okay, Houston. 2 minutes. Master Arm is On. I've got two good lights.
Roger.
Mode Select is PGNS.
Okay. Once again, in average G, I'll get the Engine Arm (switch). You confirm the ullage, I'll get the Pro. I'll back up the ullage and get the Start.
Roger.
Challenger, we're going to leave Batt(ery) 3, Off...
Auto, Auto.
until after ignition. We'll call you.
Roger. Yeah, I should have put that on like we talked about.
