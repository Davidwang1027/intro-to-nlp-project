(Music) "Good Morning America, How Are You"
Good morning, America. How are you? [Long pause.]
This is America. That's a good way to wake up.
Good morning, America. How are you? you'll be gone a million miles before the mission's done.
[Laughter] Okay. [Long pause.]
Houston, America. Are you reading okay now?
You're loud and clear, Ron. How are we?
Okay; mighty fine, Joe. [Long pause.]
Let's hear it again, Joe. [Pause.]
Are you serious?
Well, I just got on a headset. You never had a chance to...
Stand by. Here it comes.
...wake me up before. [Laughter] [Long pause.]
It's coming at you, America. [Pause.]
Okay. [Long pause.]
(Music: City of New Orleans by John Denver)
How about that?
Thank you, Joe. That's great. We're moving on.
Don't you know?
And a big eight-wheeler. [Long pause.]
And, America, you're 10 minutes from LOS, and the spacecraft looks great. [Pause.]
Okay, Joe. That's good to hear. And we're starting to move now, and we'll be ready for you when we come around.
All righty. [Pause.]
How long are you with us this morning?
Oh, not too many more minutes. [Pause.]
Hope we didn't keep you up last night.
The pleasure was ours, Jack. [Pause.] We devoted our 8 hours to selecting your wakeup call this morning and got a little help from the news room pool on that suggestion.
Well, that was a good suggestion. I had forgotten all about that song. That's a good one. [Long pause.]
You ought to find the 'Golden Rockets' for us some morning.
You'll wish you hadn't asked. [Pause.]
17, this is Houston. You'll be pleased to hear that the IR in the SIM bay is returning some beautiful data to us here.
Hey; great, Joe. That's good to hear, by gosh.
What are you learning, Joe?
Hotspots on the Moon, Jack. [Pause.]
Well, we know we had one going around it. We didn't know we had any on it. [Pause.]
Houston, the LM/CM Delta-P is 0.4.
Copy that. [Pause.]
Where - where's your big anomalies, Joe? Can you summarize quickly?
Jack, we'll get - get that for you next pass.
Well, don't worry about it. I think we're going to have a lot of things on our mind the next pass. But we're just passing over Orientale again, Joe, and in Earthlight, it's probably one of the most spectacular sights in nature. [Long pause.]
Copy that, Jack. And I can imagine.
Joe, can you imagine waking up anywhere else? [Long pause.]
17, we'll think about that 'til you go LOS. [Pause.]
Rog. [Long pause.]
17, about 30 seconds to LOS. We'll see you on the other side. It's going to be a good day.
Righto, Joe.
No, unfortunately. It doesn't mean we can't have any, though.
Where are - where are the drink bags?
We put those - are you going to wear yours in the suit this time? What did you decide?
I take it back. I take it all back. You do have things screwed on yours.
Fill it to the line or you'll get a big old air bubble in there. I don't know. Big old air bubble. Know where you can get the air bubble to where the hose is. Wait a minute. Tone booster was in A - what - 8?
Yes, I've got most of the air out of that, Jack. Just a little bubble. What's [garble] after CST down here?
How about an extra can of mixed fruit?
Thank you, sir.
We go up to 57? There's my coffee. You going to want some, Gene?
Okay. Who took this stuff?
Oh, man! Get some exercise today!
Can you read out the voltage on that other battery?
For a while, but I hope it's not the last meal we have together.
I understand that, Gene. But here they've got you getting the suits out to put the drink bag in. Then, they've got you removing the probe and drogue.
Okay, at...
In a couple of minutes, I'll take care of the SIM bay. We want all jets enabled before LOS. Do that - LOS.
Very good. It's the only way I can drink a lot of water is to drink these juices. Water is - Since I left New Mexico, I just haven't been able to drink much water. No. Well, I'm sorry. You're the only one there. Watch it, now. Somehow or another - Ron, I'll tell you - Let's see, I've got what, three fecal bags in there now? And I think I can recognize them but I - I can't remember to label those darn things. It's such an ordeal - Well, someone else - I tell you - process of elimination - you guys recognize yours and what's left is mine.
Oh, no. Ten minutes - no, it's not - [garble] 5 minutes here pretty soon. We should be through now, we're 3 minutes behind. Yes, okay - then we got to get the couches in shape. The next big set of events is getting that tunnel clear. And right now, IR Cover's going to go Close.
That's a good technique, Gene. You're to be congratulated. Looks like you did a good job.
Okay, you got that, Ron? Logic Power? Two of them Off? IR's coming Off. Yes. And give me a - verify.
Do you want to save this cup - this coffee? See what's coming up here. Okay, then we get in the helmet - then we get in the LCGs. We capped our transducers, but...
Gene, you want to - Yes. Direct O2 is Off.
Okay, Houston. We're with you and we're in the process of getting the tunnel pressurized and moving right towards probe and drogue removal.
Okay, Jack. Good morning.
Good morning, Gordy. Welcome aboard.
Thank you. [Long pause.]
I take it you're going to pick up the - the reports - post-sleep reports later. Is that correct? From Ron?
Any way it's convenient to you.
Well, we're moving towards getting the suits on. Unless you want me to take 5 minutes here, we'll leave it alone and let Ron give it to you.
That'll be fine.
Everybody ate and drank and slept just about like last night.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Good morning, Gordy.
Good morning, Commander.
Tell Joe I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to say hello to him, but I did hear his presence being evident.
Okay. We'll pass it along. [Long pause.]
Houston, America. The tunnel hatch is out.
Okeydoke, Ron. [Long pause.]
Gordy, how does America look to you this morning?
Beautiful, as it has all the way to date. [Pause.]
Okay.
Okay, Houston; America. The old probe is underneath the couch.
Okay.
Houston, America.
Go ahead, America.
Okay. How are Jack's EKGs and stuff. He's going to tape them now.
Let me get a check.
[Chuckle] Wait a minute, he's not plugged in. But, you know, he's had them on all night. Were they good?
Stand by. [Pause.]
Yes, when he was plugged in we had good signals.
Okay; good.
America, Houston. If someone's near the telemetry switch, if you go to Accept, we'll give you a state vector. [Pause.]
Okay. You have Accept.
Okay. And as we're supposed to update your trajectory, which is looking good - predicted perilune at PDI without DOI-2 would be 11.9 [nautical miles], a little lower. So that means that DOI-2 will be a little less, in terms of Delta-V, than nominal. But, otherwise, looking good.
Okay. Did you say 11.2 for perigee, now - without DOI-2?
I might have said that. It's 11.9 predicted at PDI time without DOI-2.
Oh okay, 11.9 predicted without - at PDI time without DOI-2.
That's right.
Okay, so DOI-2 will be a little less than predicted.
Affirmative.
I'm repeating it to these guys that are getting suited here, see.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay. I have your vector now. You can go back to Block.
Okay. We'll go to Block.
America, Houston. You owe us a reverification of the docking tunnel index angle. [Pause.]
Okay. Let me check it. [Pause.]
Well, I kept [garble] thinking it might move back to zero, but it hasn't moved - plus 1.2.
Okay; plus 1.2. For your information, Ron, on consumables this morning, we're running 6 percent above the Flight Plan line on RCS. On the hydrogen, we're about 8 percent above the line on Tank 2; right on the lines on the other two hydrogen tanks. And on the O2, we're running our standard 4 to 5 percent below the line on oxygen Tank 1; Tank 2 is right on; and Tank 3 has now gained to about 3 percent above the line. All looking good.
Okay, Houston. Hey, that's mighty fine.
Houston, America.
Go ahead.
Okay, I'll give you the Commander's food from yesterday.
All right. Ready to copy. [Pause.]
Four bacon squares, cornflakes, orange beverage, two sips of coffee, a vitamin. Okay, Meal B: chicken and rice soup, meatballs and sauce, orange PA drink, and caramel stick - one caramel stick. Okay, Meal C: potato soup, beef and gravy, citrus beverage, a chocolate bar, a package of pecans. [Pause.]
Okay. We're with you so far. [Long pause.]
Okay; Commander's medical log: PRD 17036, 6½ hours of good sleep, one Seconal last night, three bags of fluid.
Roger.
Three bags of water, let's - I better put it that way, I guess. [Long pause.]
Okay. Here we go on the LMPs food.
Okay.
Okay; two bacon squares, scrambled eggs, two apricots, cocoa, and a coffee. Meal B: fruitcake, cit - citrus beverage, hamburger, and a coffee. Meal C: lemonade, beef and gravy, ambrosia, cereal bar, and tea. [Pause.] I guess that's it.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Hey, Houston. Why don't I give you LMPs menu this morning too - day 5?
Okay.
Then I won't have to get back in their pages. Okay. It's a sausage patty for the LMP - sausage patties, cinnamon-toasted bread, instant breakfast, coffee with K, and a grape drink, and a vitamin. [Pause.] Okay, for the Commander on day 5: spiced oat cereal, sausage patties, instant breakfast, and vitamins.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay; for the LMPs medical log: PRD 24108, 7¼ hours very good, one Seconal last night, 3½ cans of water.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay. We're ready to go on Command Module Pilot of the spaceship America and his [garble] menu.
Go ahead, captain.
Okay, bacon squares, scrambled eggs, cornflakes, orange juice, [pause.] two coffee, three caramel candies - that's three sticks of caramel candy. Meal B: chicken and rice, meatballs, butterscotch pudding, orange PA drink. I missed the vitamins up there in A, too. Okay, Meal C: potato soup, beef and gravy, chicken stew, orange GF drink, tea, chocolate bar, and a package of pecans. [Long pause.]
Okay; CMP medical log: PRD 15034, and about 5½ of good sleep; a little trouble getting to sleep last night, and I woke up early this morning. I took a Seconal; didn't seem to have much good - much effect, and I had four cans of water.
Roger. [Pause.]
I think I was on the biomed all the time last night, too, so you can check out that sleep.
Okay, Ron, While you've got that book with you, I can give you a one-line change to the E-memory load as a result of our changing the short-burn constant.
Okay. Stand by 1 here.
Okay, Houston; America. I've got the right page now.
Okay. It's page 1-43. It's load Delta. Identifier number 5; the old value is 01606. Change that to 01637. [Pause.]
Okay. It'll be load Delta, and the octal identifier 05, and its new value is 01637.
That's correct. [Long pause.]
Okay. The LMP has got his suit on. They're connecting up the LCG water connection, and he's still unzipped.
Okay, Ron. In the Flight Plan, you're coming up on a Verb 45 and then going to P00 prior to the P52. After going to P00, we'd like you to change to B/D Roll from A/C. Over.
Okay. We'll change the B/D Roll. Looks like we're going to run into a problem on our P52 down here, with these guys getting suited. Is it really necessary now? [Pause.]
There's no time criticality on that. When they're out of the way, go ahead with it.
Okay. Good.
Okay, Houston, how do you read the LMP?
LMP, you're loud and clear.
Okay, Gordy, I'm opening the hatch.
Okay. [Pause.]
And the light's still on.
Rog. [Long pause.]
Okay, Gordy. Index 1 plus - or plus 1.2.
Roger.
Okay, Houston, I'm going to skip the P52 here for a while and maneuver to the docking attitude - undock attitude, that is.
Roger. [Pause.] Stand by on that one, Ron. [Pause.]
Wilco.
We want to be sure we can get some stars - good stars in the undock attitude. [Long pause.]
Ron, this is Houston. We didn't see you do a Verb 45. Over. [Pause.]
You're right. Good one.
And if there's any - if you - if there's no reason why not, we'd just as soon you go ahead and do the P52 now. Finish that off and then start the maneuver. Over.
Okay. The big reason is that Gene's getting into his suit right now.
Okay.
As soon as he gets out and gets in his suit, well, I'll do a P52 maneuver.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Ron, Houston. Can you give us Auto on the High Gain? [Pause.]
Okay. Just a second, Houston. [Long pause.]
We're transferring to LM Power, Houston.
Okay; Off, Reset, back to Off.
Okay. We have LM Power.
Okay. That was 107:49:28.
Roger. [Long pause.]
LM Water's Open, and O2's Open.
Roger. [Long pause.]
Okay; 3-4, Houston, in the LM. And step 1 is good.
Okay.
Okay. Step 2 is complete.
Okay, Jack.
And I'm going off of CSM comm, and I'll be coming at you before long on - on S-Band, if I can.
Okay.
Ron, Houston. We've taken a look at stars available in the undock attitude, and they don't look too good. We suggest you use the present attitude for your 52 and then maneuver. Over.
Okay. I'm just about to get Gene out of the way here, and then I will.
Okay, and we're less than 3 minutes to LOS now. So when you finish that 52, we'd like you to copy down the Noun 5 and 93s for us.
Okay; will do.
America, Houston. About 1 minute to LOS. Nothing further for you. We'll see you on the other side. [Pause.]
Okay, Gordo. We're hustling like hell. We might make it. [Laughter]
Roger.
59 Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 17. We've had Loss of Signal at this time as Apollo 17 coasted behind the Moon on the tenth lunar orbit. Approximately 47 minutes until the spacecraft both come around the far side as the crew prepares to transfer into the Lunar Module; that is, Cernan and Schmitt prepare to transfer into the Lunar Module. Get it powered up in preparation for today's activities of the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver number 2 and ultimately the landing at Taurus-Littrow and the first extravehicular activity. As they come around the Moon on the eleventh revolution, they will have checked out the Lunar Module with a few exceptions such as they will deploy the landing gear after Acquistion of Signal. Also at that time, both spacecraft, Challenger and America, though still docked, will be on separate air to ground links. The Lunar Module will be on the normal channel; the Command Service Module link, with Ron Evans, will be piped into Room 161 in the News Center building for those newsmen covering the mission who prefer to listen to the Command Service Module orbital science activities. As Apollo 17 went behind the western limb of the Moon, the orbit measured 12 nautical miles at pericynthion and 60.2 at apocynthion [22.2 by 111.5 km]. Some maneuvers coming up - the next major maneuver for the Lunar Module will be the Descent Orbit Insertion number 2 which at this time is predicted, or is calculated to take place at a Ground Elapsed Time of 112 hours, 1 minute, 59.1 seconds. Total burn time of 21.8 seconds for a Delta-V or velocity change of 7.6 feet per second, which will change the orbit to an apocynthion of 60.4 nautical miles [111.9 km] and a pericynthion, or nearest approach, which is just uprange of the landing site, of 6.7 nautical miles [12.4 km, 40,700 feet]. The big maneuver of the day, of course, is Powered Descent and Landing, which at this time is calculated to take place at a Ground Elapsed Time of 112 hours, 49 minutes, 27 seconds, lasting 11 minutes and 57 seconds, plus whatever hover time is available as they get down to the landing site. Total Delta-V, or velocity change, to get out of orbit and break into the descent path and ultimately the hovering and touchdown at Taurus-Littrow is 6,693 feet per second [2,040 m/s]. Some 43 minutes now away from acquisition as Apollo 17, America and Challenger, come from behind the Moon on orbit number 11. And at 108:04 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
[Cough] What do you need? A helmet? Tough - tough. Well, there's a label on the outside; I haven't looked on the inside yet. Okay.
What? 108 - coming up on 108:12 in 20 seconds. Set it 108:12:15 then - 30 seconds from now. Set it for 15, I missed it. Okay, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19...
I can't find any stars.
Yes, we're upside down in the wrong attitude. I can't find any stars. Slow - stop.
Okay. We're finally going to maneuver to the attitude.
Well, we don't have our suits on yet, but we finally got in alignment. We're moving to attitude. It'll be awhile yet. If you want to, I'll go ahead. I can put my suit on at the same time.
Yes. You need to get to attitude faster?
Are you with - Houston? Okay. I'm going to take my helmet off then, and try to get dressed.
There we go. Should have done that in the first place. [Long pause.]
Okay, Okay.
Challenger, this is Houston. How do you read?
Hello, Gordy, this is Challenger, we're reading you loud and clear.
Okay. You're readable. Lots of background noise at the moment. [Pause.]
Okay. We'll update you in just a minute.
Okay, Gene, that's locked. [Pause.]
Okay. Another one is verify locked. The band was up. So you're locked here; the red thing is in.
Okay.
And I'll [garble] you up.
Okay, and I got it over here.
Okay. Okay. Comm checks.
Let me give them an E-memory dump. I can press on. Gordy, Jack'll update you in just a second. And I've got some words for you, but I'd like to give you an E-memory dump as soon as you get the steerable.
[Garble] they got the steerable. Okay.
Okay, Gordy. How do you read the LMP? This is your S-Band T/R in secondary power amp check.
Okay, LMP. You're clear. Lots of background noise though.
Okay. I'm going to bring up the steerable.
Okay; go ahead. [Long pause.]
Okay, steerable [garble]. [Long pause.]
[Garble] going to make it?
[Garble] switch here, I have to wait for this one. [Long pause.]
Pitch is good. [Garble.]
Okay. YAW minus 0.2.
Yaw is good. [Long pause.]
Do you know where our scissors...
Okay, Houston. How do you read?
Okay. You're loud and clear, Jack.
Yeah, they're in the...
Okay. Okay.
[Garble] data file.
Hey, Ron. We need to check out that VHF. You ought to get that done before you close up, Ron. Houston, we'll be right with you. We're going to check out our VHF. Let me finish this part of it, and then - we'll get that.
Okay. You want to read that to me, Gene - the S-Band?
Okay. Where are you now?
I'm right here in the middle of the page.
Okay. S-Band PM.
PM.
Secondary...
Houston, How do you read the LM?
Loud and clear, Jack.
Okay. We're in step 2, and - we're giving you your second S-Band check. And I'm going Track Mode Auto.
Okay. You sound good. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston, I can hear the antenna rumbling up there, but - I still have not peaked. Still reading 3.7.
Okay. You're loud and clear, Jack. It looks like a good lock to us.
Okay. We'll leave it - Okay. I'll leave it there, and I'm going Biomed Right.
Roger.
Okay. Squelch is Off. How do you read?
Still loud and clear.
Roger. Okay [garble].
Hello, Houston. I'm ready to give you an E-memory dump.
Okay. We're ready to take it. Go ahead.
Okay, Ron, how do you - Ron, how do you read on Simplex Bravo?
I do not read you. Coming at you.
Okay. I don't read you at all, Jack.
Hey, Ron, I do not read you. Check your VHF switch.
Okay. I'm down to Simplex Bravo. [Pause.]
Yeah; go ahead.
I'm talking on B now. How do you read?
I do not read you. Do you read me?
No, I don't read you at all either, Jack.
No, I don't read you. [Long pause.]
Okay. I've got everything on in my Auto panel. Let me try the other one for backup. [Long pause.]
Yep, I'm on Left. I'm on Left? Let me go to Backup.
Okay. I've got you; I got you.
I don't have you, yet.
Okay.
Okay. How do you read on VHF Bravo? You're loud and clear.
Hey, I finally got you!
That was my fault, Ron.
Okay. You were kind of clipping there for a little bit. I got the last part of your transmission.
Okay. It was just warming up. You're loud and clear now.
Okay. I heard that it was just - I missed the just - It was just warming up, but I got the loud and clear.
Okay, Houston. I've got a couple I want to pass on to you.
Go ahead, Gene. [Pause.]
Okay. When I first put in the...
Okay, Ron, how do you read now?
...LGC breaker...
Okay. I read you loud and clear; that's VHF B.
Stand by, Houston.
Am I clipping now, Ron?
Yeah, I didn't hear you at all that time.
Am I clipping now?
Yeah, you're still clipping. All I got was "now."
Okay. How do you read now?
Okay. "How do you read now?" I got that.
Okay. I guess we're okay. It was the squelch.
[Laughter] Then I missed that part of it. [Pause.]
Ron, how do you hear, Gene?
Okay. Loud and clear, Gene.
Okay; very good.
How do you read the LMP now, Ron?
Now, you're still clipping, Jack. Can you move your mike a little bit closer or something?
Okay. How do you read now?
No, I didn't read you at all that time.
How do you read now?
Not clear.
Okay. I've got the Squelch to full decrease.
Well, you're going to have to yell or something. I still - you're still clipping yourself out, Jack.
Okay. Do you read Gene, Ron?
No, I didn't read you that time.
Okay. We're going to press on and get these VHF checks Go. We can cut them.
Okay. Okay; switching to Alpha.
Bravo is off; Simplex Alpha is on. [Pause.]
Okay, Ron. How do you read on Alpha?
Don't read you.
How do you read on Alpha, Ron?
Don't read you.
How do you read the LMP on Alpha, Ron?
Okay. I don't read you guys at all, except through the tunnel. [Pause.]
How do you read on Alpha, Ron?
Okay. Got you loud and clear that time. And, Gene, can you verify the capture latches are all engaged?
Okay. How do you read me?
I didn't read you at all, Jack.
This is Gene. How do you read me on Alpha?
Didn't read you.
Okay. Let's press on. You're getting us intermittent. We can get it.
Okay. I got you that time, and check the capture latches.
Okay, Houston. I'm pretty sure the VHF...
Okay?
...is all right. It seems to have something to do with the Squelch setting, and it's probably because we're so close.
Okay. We concur. We'd like you to press on and not worry about the VHF any more for now.
Okay, Gordo. We are. Here's a couple of quick ones. When I pushed the LGC DSKY breaker, In, I did not get a restart light. The keyboard came up with 400 in R-2. The LGC light was already on, and it went off as prescribed. When I did a Verb 35, I got all the proper lights except when the LGC and ISS lights came on, the entire Caution and Warning dimmed. One more item. In our DAP setting, we are reading in our checklist for R-1 plus 645 and for R-2 plus 641. The DSKY DAP came up plus 641 and plus 645. It just reversed those numbers. And I'm going to deploy the landing gear.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. Master Arm is on, and B light is on.
Roger.
Roger. Are you ready for a landing gear?
Yeah, I'm up in the tunnel, but go ahead. [Pause.]
Ron, if you read, the landing gear is coming on my Mark.
Okay. I read you. Go ahead.
3, 2, 1...
Mark.
Hey, Houston. We got a good one out front.
Sounds good.
[Laughter]
We show them all deployed.
And the flag is gray. Okay. The flag is gray.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. The Primary Evap Flow time, 108 - Evap Flow time 108:16:55. And I'm ready to copy your abort constants and a DOI-2 pad.
Okay, Jack. Here come the abort constants. 224 is - 6...
Stand by, Gordy.
Okay. Stand by. [Pause.]
Ron, when you get the tunnel closed out, I'll need you for an IMU coarse align.
Okay. I'm getting the probe umbilicals installed now.
Okay. I'll need your Noun 20s, when you get a chance.
Okay, Gordy. You can go ahead, and you have Data on the Updata Link.
Okay. We'll have the up-link in a minute. 224 is 60470, 29364, 60386, 00594, 32772, 54404. Go ahead.
Okay. 60470, 29364, 60386, 00594, 32772, 54404.
Okay. That was a good readback. Ready with DOI-2 when you are. [Pause.]
Okay, Gordy. Go ahead.
Okay. The - it's DOI-2; TIG time is 112:02:40.92; Noun 81 is a minus 0007.5, Delta-VY plus all balls, and Delta-VZ is plus all balls.
Okay, Gene. Can you look at the capture latches? I've got it preloaded here now.
Noun 42, 00615...
Okay. Preload the - it's pushing on by, so I'll going to - [garble] preloaded.
...plus 00067...
Okay.
...00075; burn time 0:22, 000, 074...
What do you mean; probe locked?
Yes, it was locked. Oh, the drogue. Yes. Yes, it's locked in there.
And 373 is a 0122.7.
The AGS Delta-Vs are NA.
Okay, Gordy. 112:02:40.92; minus three zeros 75, plus all zeros, plus all zeros; 00615, plus three zeros 67, three zeros 75; 0:22; all zeros, 074; 0122.7; rest of PAD NA.
That's correct, Jack. [Long pause.]
Okay. Stand by - I've - let's see. Okay.
Okay. I need your numbers then. Noun 20.
Okay, Gordy. I'm going to start the lunar batt check, and it'll be silent.
Okay. We're watching.
Ron, I need your - your Noun 20 numbers. [Long pause.]
Okay. There we go. Plus 356.95, plus 106.34, and a plus 001.49.
Okay. I got 356.95, 106.34, and 001.49.
Right?
Challenger, we want to get the attitude tweaked back up closer to the normal before doing the coarse align. [Pause.]
America, Houston.
Hey, Ron, they want a more normal attitude for you. You're not quite nominal. [Long pause.]
If you're talking to me, it's about 0 - 104.7 and then 0. [Pause.]
Challenger, the uplink's in there. It's your computer.
Okay, Gordy. Thank you. And, Ron, let me know when you're tweaked up, and then go Min Deadband, Att Hold. [Pause.]
Okay, Houston; America. 0105 and 0, correct?
Yes, sir. [Long pause.]
That's interesting. I don't know how it got off attitude. [Pause.]
Yeah, I was going to ask you the same thing. You might have knocked a - a stick or something while everybody was flailing around down there. Could you...
Maybe - maybe I hit the stick or something. Yeah.
Yeah. [Pause.]
Okay, Gene. We're Min Deadband Att Hold at 0105 and 0.
Okay. Read out Noun 20.
Okay; Verb 6, Noun 20: 000.32, 104.40, 359.55.
Okay. I got all those.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. I skipped a step on Lunar Bat, Off/Reset; I'll go back.
Okay, Houston. I forgot to release the docking latches. Okay. I'll go up and release docking latches 1 and 7.
Okay.
And if I just put the - No, I'll do that.
Jack, we need the - we think you missed a step. We need to -
I was going to say you could read the probe temp if I put the circuit breakers in.
CDR, Lunar Bat, Off/Reset.
Yeah. That's right, I'll go - that's affirm; I'll go back. Stand by.
Okay. [Pause.]
Okay. There's number 1. One releases; two releases, and it's free...
Okay. I'm back to Lunar Bat - LMP Lunar Bat Off/Reset.
...Seven. [Pause.]
Roger. [Pause.]
Okay, Gordy. For the LM, I've got 300.88, 284.40, and three balls 45. How does that sound?
One release, two releases, and it's free.
Stand by. We're checking. [Long pause.]
Okay. Docking Probe circuit breakers; two of them are going Close. Main A. Main B. [Pause.] Probe Extend/Release is going to Retract. Ah ha, I've got two barber poles.
Okay, Geno. Those angles are okay.
That's a good sign.
Okay, figured they were. They're going in.
Okay. Docking probe circuit breakers are going Open. [Pause.] Okay. Extend/Releases, and they went gray, of course, when then went open. Okay. Extend/Release to Off. Verify probe extend latch engage indicator's not visible. Well, I'll go back - it wasn't a while ago, but I'll go look again. [Pause.] Only if you hit Extend with the circuit breakers in. [Pause.] Mighty fine. It's still back inside there. Extend latch is still engaged. [Long pause.]
Okay, Ron. On my mark, I'd like an 06 20.
Okay. Standing by. Go ahead.
Okay, 3, 2, 1...
Mark it.
Okay. 000.44, 104.63, 359.69. [Pause.]
Okay. Got those. [Pause.]
Okay, Challenger. We've got those angles here on the ground...
Okay...
...for both spacecraft.
Fine, Gordy.
Okay, Houston, ED bat, 37.2, 37.2 at 109:14:00.
Roger. [Pause.]
And all battery indications onboard were normal, once I got started.
Okay. They looked good to us, also. [Pause.]
America, Houston, in order to get on and stay on the time line, I'll remind you about the lithium canister after PDI; we can let that one go. And if you'd like to let the camera business slide until after your suit check and we'll get those things. I'll come back and remind you of those, too.
Ron, I want you to stay in that Min Deadband Att Hold. I'm going to do a P52.
Okay. I've got the - the cameras all set. I got them out, anyhow. I don't have the - the right values on the lenses yet; but, anyhow, the camera are out and they're loaded.
Okay.
I've got mag OO on the Hasselblad.
Houston, this is the LMP. A couple minor things on the back-side checkout. The secondary glycol pump, when I started it, the sound and the pressure was ragged, oscillated around - 20 psi, and then stabilized. After about 15 seconds, it sounded smooth. It had a sound as if it was cavitating a little bit; but, after that, it was smooth. Over.
Copy that, Jack.
Okay, Houston. Why don't I go ahead and get the PGA ver out of the way, and then we can get some of the - data, or would you rather get the data up first?
And on step 3 on page 3-15...
...When I went to Suit Fan 1, I got a Master Alarm...
No, it's your choice. Why don't we go ahead and get the PGA, and I'll just sit on these PADs, and could you tell me if you ever got around to playing with the squelch on the VHF?
...but all other indications were okay, and the Master Alarm reset.
Okay. [Pause.]
Okay. I'm sorry. I misinterpreted the words there; I should have gotten that. Forget that one.
Well, I did. And, let's see, we're at Squelch A now. I've even got it all the way down to 1, and I still don't hear them.
Roger. We concur. [Pause.]
Okay. You did get a satisfactory check on your side, didn't you?
Okay, Geno. You need some help?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
I got a satisfactory - Every once in a while I can hear them now; they're cutting in and out somewhere, I don't know where.
All righty. [Long pause.]
Okay. Squelch A is sitting at about 4. [Long pause.]
And, America, we'll give you a state vector if you give us Accept. [Pause.]
Okay. You have it. [Long pause.]
Thank you.
[Garble] what star you got, 30? Or no, what star?
Loaded it? Okay. Okay, and those are the numbers. [Pause.] Hey, that's good. Okay. You ready to mark? What do you want first? [Pause.]
[Garble].
[Garble].
Jack, we'd like to take a look at the glycol pump pressure. Can you close the Glycol Pump Secondary pressure breaker?
Better finish this. [Long pause.]
Gordy, you want the secondary?
That's affirmative; panel 16, Glycol Pump Secondary breaker - third row, in the middle.
Okay. We've got a Glycol light, and the temperature is 50.
Okay. The pressure looked good there. We'd like that breaker back open. [Pause.] The Master Alarm you have is normal.
Roger. Understand it.
Houston, America. How much time to AOS, yet - LOS?
Oh, about 29 minutes.
Oh, okay. Got a little time for the PGA ver then, I guess. [Pause.]
And it's your computer, anytime you want to get to it, Ron.
Okay. [Pause.]
Ah ha, I got the old helmet and gloves on. [Long pause.]
More cables all over the place here than I know what to do with.
Well, this place looks like a pigpen - you've run the same course everyone else has, I guess.
[Laughter] I got cables and hoses and...
Son-of-a-muck - I hit the stick again. Now I got to unlock it.
Ron, keep in Min Deadband Att hold. I've got to finish the P52.
Okay. You want me to maneuver back to attitude, Gene?
No, just stay where you are.
We're out of attitude just a little bit.
Just stay where you are, and put it in Min Deadband.
Well I'm Min Deadband, but I maneuvered out of attitude. You want to go back to regular attitude?
No! N O, no! [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. [Garble] flow return is [garble] Suit Flow valve. The other two are closed; mine is open, and I got the inner connect in between the other ones.
Sounds good.
How's the old suit pressure? Okay. Looks like pretty good. Okay. O2 flow is lower limit. Okay. Let's go up to Press. Here we go. That's going up to Press, [pause] and it feels like it's going up.
And terminal Direct O2 on air to [garble] O2 Flow High.
Hey, Ron. This is Challenger. We're going to be off your loop for awhile, so we can finish the marks.
Okay. Wait a minute, Jack. I'll just go to Receive on the VHF. I'll just go to Receive on the VHF, Jack. [Long pause.]
Okay. Let's see, and there's a Delta-P of about - 6½ - Now we're going to cycle suit circuit return here. Okay. It's out; it's back in. Okay. Now we can squirt a little more O2 flow in. [Long pause.]
Whoo hoo! - There we go. Man, oh man! [Pause.]
Direct O2 is Off. [Pause.]
That's coming down. Shoot! I'm reading 4.5 in my suit. Is that right?
5.
Looks like about 4 on our data, Ron.
Well, I'll be darned. The old suit gauge read 4.5. [Pause.]
[Garble] that close in there. Let's say about maybe nine or something like that. That's closer to four. Can't tell for sure what it feels like. Anyhow, the O2 flow is down. It's not leaking very much. I'm reading about 0.3. Something like that. [Pause.]
Okay. We're - we're showing 4.2 to 4.3 on our pressure spread, and you're cabin and suit pressure gauges probably show something similar. And we show that the flow rate is down.
Oh, okay. That's not too bad. That's pretty close.
Yeah. And the O2 flow is staying pretty good.
[Garble] let's go to Depress on this thing, huh?
Sounds good.
Okay; so it looks like it's sta - stable there, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
Okay. Let's go to Depress. [Long pause.]
And my ears are pretty good. If you guys are okay I'm going to go to Off. Save a little time here. [Long pause.]
America, I don't know if I copied you correctly. You don't want to go to Off on that Suit Test valve until the pressures are back down to normal. If that was what you asked.
[Laughter]
Hello, Houston.
Or are you already there?
I changed my mind.
That looked to be a pretty good alignment from where I saw it. There's 07 for you.
Okay. We copy. [Pause.]
Yeah. My ears are popping to meet demand - I changed my mind, I'll let it go down slowly.
Okay.
Okay. And we've got about 20 minutes before LOS, so there's no hurry on those PADs. I've got them standing by when you're ready, and didn't know what you - what you had in mind about working on these things. We might get - you might get started on the hatch integrity check, if you get to that point, and I can give you the PADs while you're waiting for it to bleed down or whatever it turns out to be convenient. [Pause.]
Okay, Challenger. Torque them. [Pause.]
Okay. Let's see, I guess it's about time to [pause] Integrity check; okay.
Okay. And I guess the LM is going to be asking you for a Noun 20 pretty soon like, here. [Long pause.]
Hello, America; Challenger. We no longer need your Min Deadband.
Okay, Challenger; America here. I'll go back to CMC.
Okay. But I would like a Noun 20 from you on my mark.
Stand by. Okay, go.
Okay; 3, 2, 1...
Mark.
Okay; 002.15, 104.36, 359.69.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Okay, Challenger, we've got the Noun 20s, both spacecraft. [Pause.]
And Houston, do we want to release those docking latches before they do their hot fire? I don't think so. Do we?
I'll check. Stand by. [Long pause.]
Challenger, Houston, we're ready anytime for the RCS pressurization. You might turn the data switch off.
You're right, Ron, we'll - we'll just hold up on that release on the latches until the hot fires are over. So, when you get your copying hand ready, why, we'll give you some PADs. We'll clean that one up.
We just got that, and we're going.
Okay. [Pause.]
Okay. Let's see. [Pause.]
Reading 2 SCS. Integrity check - Okay, it didn't...
Master Arm is On; I've got one good light - System A.
Okeydoke.
Okay, Houston. Let's see - where are we going to start on the PADs?
Okay. And you might go to Block on the computer, too.
Okay.
Okay. On my mark; 3, 2, 1...
Mark it. We heard it.
Okay. The first thing I'll give you is the Sep PAD.
Okay. Let's go.
And that is on page 113.
Okay.
Okay. Noun 33 is 110:27:55.00. Roll is 0, 105 pitch, and yaw is 0. [Pause.]
Okay. Noun 33, 110:27:55.00, and roll, pitch, and yaw are as depicted: 0, 105, and 0. Right?
Okay, Challenger. We saw it, and it looks good. RCS looks good.
Looks good onboard, Gordo.
That's affirm.
Okay; got it.
Okay. The next thing I have for you is a P24 PAD that goes on page 115. [Pause.]
Okay. Suit Test valves in Off now. On page 115 - Okay; got it.
Okay. It'll be 17-1; 110:58:13; T-2 is 111:00:30; 01:00; 01:...
Okay, Houston. Verify high bit rate - and, Ron, we need you in Wide Deadband Attitude/Hold.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[garble] hold it. Okay, Wide Deadband Att/Hold, that's what I'm on. And Amer - Houston; America, I missed T-2 on.
Challenger, we verify high bit rate.
Okay. Are you ready to go back to it now?
Okay; ready for T-2.
All right, sir T-2: 111:00:30; 01:...
Okay. Here we go, Houston, with the cold fire check.
...00; 01:26; Roll 015, 297, 000; North 02. Over. [Pause.]
Shoot!
Okay. All set.
Okay. I'll read back what I have. T-1 110:58:13. I missed T-2. TCA is 01:00; T-3 is 01:26; Roll 15, pitch 297, and 0; North 02. I presume 17.1.
Yes, sir. And T-2 time is 111:00:30.
Okay. 111:00:30.
That's correct.
Challenger said something every time you talked on that one.
Okay, Houston. PGNS Rate Command (Cold Fire), AGS pulse (Cold Fire) check.
Okay; press on.
Hey, Jack, could you go to Receive only on the VHF for a little bit?
Sure, Ron.
Okay.
And, Houston; America. You can go ahead on the next PAD.
Okay. On page 113, I've got a DAP load for you. [Pause.]
Okay.
Okay. The weight: 37983; plus 0.40, plus 0.91. [Pause.]
Okay, CSM weight is 37983; pak to off, plus 0.40; yak to off, plus 0.91.
Okay. That's correct. And the last one comes up on page 121, and it's a LM P76.
Ah ha; okay.
All right, Houston. Step 4. AGS Rate Command (Cold Fire), 4 Jet Secondary Coil (Hot Fire) check.
Okay, Noun 33.
Okay, 121 - Got it.
Okay. Go. We're looking good so far.
All right, sir. 112:02:51.92; minus...
Hey, Ron. We're going to have some hot fires here. We're going to have some hot fires here in a minute.
Okay. Wait a min - Hold it. America, [garble] Challenger. The hot fire - you want Free, Challenger?
That's affirm. Go CMC Mode Free.
Challenger, America. You want Free for the hot fire?
That is affirm. We want you Free, Ron.
Okay. Going to Free now. [Pause.]
And, Houston; America. You can try that one again.
All righty. Noun 33 is 112:02:51.92; minus 0007.5 and all zips for Y and Z.
Ron, go Receive Only.
[Laughter]. Okay, say that Noun 33 again.
Houston, America. We're cut out on Noun 33 again, and I've got minus 0007.5 and X, Y, and Z are 0.
Okay. And the time, 112:02:51.92.
Houston, hardover looked good from here.
Okay; looked good down here.
Okay, Noun 33 is 112:02:51 - 112:02:51.92.
All right, Houston. PGNS Minimum Impulse (Hot Fire) check.
Okay.
That's correct. [Long pause.]
Okay, Houston. We had a sticky talkback red on System A, Quad 4. And it went to gray with a tap.
Okay, Jack.
Okay - Ron, the hot fire checks are complete. You can go into Wide Deadband Att/Hold.
Okay, Challenger; America. You're in ATT hold. You didn't get very far off that time, either. That's good. Okay.
Challenger, those all look good here.
And I think we got them all.
Okay.
Okay, Gordo. Understand. [Long pause.]
Okay. We're on the top of 3-28, Gordo.
Roger. We're with you. [Long pause.]
Okay, Challenger; America.
Go - go ahead, Ron.
Okay. I'm going to turn off B3 and also my roll jets, and then I'm going to undo the docking latches.
Okay, you want to verify your - your transponder is Off as well as B3?
That's - verified Transponder is Off.
Okay. And you did get the umbilicals. Right?
Say again about umbilicals.
You did get the LM-to-CM umbilicals, right?
All I get is umbilicals. I didn't get the question.
Did you disconnect the LM-to-CM umbilicals? Verify.
Verify. I have those down here.
Okay. Very good. [Pause.]
And jet Bravo 3 is Off. [Pause.]
Okay, Ron, we're about 5 minutes from LOS. And the only thing that you wouldn't be able to do following right down your checklist is to get the VHF data on and check the tape recorder at LOS. The rest of that stuff you can follow right on through, and we'll remind you on the lithium change after descent. So it looks like we're caught up again.
Challenger, Houston. We cannot completely explain the startup indications you had on the PGNS, but they are of no great concern. It looks good so far. The DAP gimbal trims are no problem. Don't bother changing them. And there will be no PIPA bias update yet, anyway. Over.
Okay. Understand. Was the checklist written backwards on that?
It was a Cape problem on their tape, and they had it reversed. But it's in the noise level, anyway. No problem.
Okay. [Long pause.]
Challenger, Houston. You have a Go for undocking and sep.
Rog; understand. A Go for undocking and sep. [Long pause.]
Okay, number 5. One , two - and it's fully released, and the hook is off of the docking ring. Okay. Number 6 is - one, two - and it's fully released, and the hook is off of the docking ring. Okay, 7 is released, and the hook is off of the docking ring. [Pause.] O2 flow still okay?
Yes, sir. Looking good.
Okay, here's number 8. Here's one, two. And the chute's fully released, and the hook is off the docking ring. [Pause.]
Okay, here's number 9. One, two, and she's fully released; the hook clears the docking ring. Okay, number 10. Here's one, two - fully released, and the hook clears the docking ring. There's one, 11. Okay, handle's free; J-hook clears the ring. I've only got one more to go. There's the first latch there's two latches [garble] came over. And the hook stays clear; the handle is free. And, by golly, they're all off. Hey, Challenger; America. You're hanging on those three little bitty things.
Okay. Fine, Ron.
Okay. I put the old - hatch in.
Challenger, Houston. About 1 minute to LOS, and we'll see you when you come around the other side, independently. [Pause.]
Okay, Gordo; understand. I'm in step 4, Rendezvous Radar mode [garble] to Auto.
Okay, Ron, we're within a minute of LOS. Your O2 flow still looks good, and the rest of the stuff that you can get on the VHF is going to be just fine. You're right on schedule now.
Roger.
And the radar has come out, and I'm in Radar Test now.
Okay. I'll get that VHF stuff and then put the hatch in.
Jack, just a friendly reminder to do the LOS procedures on the steerable. [Pause.]
Okay.
Okay, we're in Receive Only to B Data.
Hey, Challenger; America.
57, up live at next Acquisition of Signal as America and Challenger come around on the twelfth revolution, this is Apollo Control.
