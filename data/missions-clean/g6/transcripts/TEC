Hawaii, Gemini VI. Go.
How are you doing up there?
Very good. Completed the Plane-Change burn. No residuals. The fuel remaining is 75 percent.
Okay. You burned out all residuals and the fuel remaining is 75 percent.
That's affirm. We are now back to SEF aline.
Okay. If you get too warm, you can turn on your secondary loop if you like.
Want to do that?
Roger. We're back to one fan. I think we will turn on the secondary loop.
Okay. Will you turn your ECS O2 heater off?
Okay.
Roger.
You've got enough heat to maintain pressure. And I've got this Height-Adjust here if you would like to copy it. It's a tweak burn.
Secondary loop.
Roger.
Secondary loop on and - -
Roger. We'll give it a tweak.
Okay. We copy your pump is on. The GET B 03:03:19; Delta-V, 0.8; your burn time, zero plus 01; yaw and pitch are zero; Core 25, 00008; Cores 26 and 27 are zeros; use your aft thrusters; the maneuver is Posigrade.

Very good. We haven't heard him since - quite a long time ago.
Okay.

I don't want to blind you, Wally, on this thing.
Good. I'll go ahead Frank.
We've about 35 to go.
About 35 degrees.
Roger.
Got the dock light on?
...
The lights are on.
... turning dock light off.

Hurry up a bit so I can aline the platform.
I have to get data.
Hey, hold it right there! Stay where you are!

You want me to do that or do you want me to stay where I am? I better stay where I am, I guess.

Right on the line.
Where's our plot?
Right there.
Start getting the point. You can talk to them about that.
Yes.
Gemini VII, VI. From our plot on the data point, looks like we're right on the line. The last data point was 38 degrees at about 22 miles.
Pitching up at 10 minutes.
Yes.
Okay. I'll pitch up and look at you again, Frank.
Pitch angle ... I better stay locked on.
I got him.
Blinking?
You're blinking.
Looks like you're blinking, Frank.
Okay, that was him.
A little to the right.
About 50 degrees.
About 50 degrees, Frank.
Okay, let's get that data point.
Right on.
What do you get, Wally?
It's 7 forward, 5 left, 7 up.
5 left and 7 up. Go get him!
Up first?
Yes. You can get thrust orthogonally if you want to.
And forward last.
Yes. Up and left.
Yes.
Okay. We have to track 15 to 17.
About 55 degrees, Frank.
Affirmative. Affirmative.
He wants ... you to ...
Yes. We need a tad up.
Good.
A little below. I'll take it off the ball.
Wally, range rate, if you get a chance.
Okay. About 105 to 110.
Okay.
Good show.
Recording.
Range-rate reading 110. The attitude is approximately 55 off the ball. The range is 13.06.
Good.
Roger. About 62 degrees.
Very good.
Wally, how did it seem to track him with respect to stars on that reticle? This is just an evaluation.
My stars look pretty bleak out there.
I don't have any. There's the dock light.
You're right on it now, Frank.
Very good.
Okay. Coming up to 15 minutes.
Pretty good track. Dock light is bright as the Agena.
If you get a chance, you can get me some range-rate readings.
Less than 100. About 90 now.
Good show!
It's really bright now, isn't it? (Dock light.)
Yes.
16 minutes.
Sneaking up to meet you, Frank. Directly abeam and to the left are two stars called Castor and Pollux.
Pitch.
Ballpark pitch is about 70 degrees.
The idea is we go ...
Yes.
Boy, the dock light knocks out the ACQ lights, doesn't it?
Yes. Why don't you tell him? I'm too busy.
Frank, you're just what we thought before. Your dock light completely wipes out the ACQ lights.
Oh no, no, no! (Don't turn dock light off.)
7.77 (Range.)
Okay. Zero addresses 25, 26 and 27. That's better.
74.2. Okay. 25.
There are some stars out there. Good!
You got 19 minutes?
Coming up on 19.
Sure do. I'd get the data otherwise.
27 ...
Okay. Good show, Wally!
Do you see Castor and Pollux?
Oh, yes, I sure do.
We're going to perform the backup check.
Yes. Okay. Stand by ... Okay, you've got 3 seconds to go, Wally. 2, 1. MARK.
Got it.
We're about 10 degrees ahead of schedule but that isn't too bad. We transferred a little late ... with no sweat, Wally.
Yes.
Okay. Next data point will be at 22 minutes.
Right.
Okay. The next correction will probably be - may be a little bit up. Here it is; I have it for you on the plot. We're right there.
Oh, yes.
Here's where we transmit. We're coming right up to it.
... there are 20 minutes to go.
22 is 94.3. And that is 14.3. The total.

I'm going to say 60 percent up.
That's it, right?
I can't get a photo.
Oh, yes.

Did I hear something?
Our HF is ...

Probably. I'll retrack the HF a little more.
You got a big string hanging on the back of you.
That's the strap we've been talking about.
Yes. It looks like you have a big rope hanging from the back, Frank. It's probably the strap you've been talking about.
Yes, and you have one too. How about coming around and looking me over?
Be very glad to.
Gemini VI, Gemini VI, Houston CAP COM. Standing by.
Oh, oh! Sunlight!
Houston, this is Gemini VI. Go ahead.

That sun is blinding.
Hello Houston. Gemini VI.
Holding 120.
Gemini VI. Houston is standing by.
Roger. We're all sitting up here playing bridge together.
Well we have a - what range are we, Tom?
Roger. We have 120 feet steady.
Roger. Understand. Stationkeeping at 120 feet.
I can't see him.
Can you see him?
You got a lot of stuff all around the back end of you. Must be the ... off from the ... test ...
I can't see him. If you can probably keep --
Let me know how close you think we are, Frank. I can't see it at all. The sun's in my eyes.

Okay ... Up a little bit, just a little bit. You're right on it in yaw, Wally.
I got the radar needles. That's all I can see. Completely in the sun.
You want me to stay stationary now, Wally? We're almost face up.
This is VII.
Go ahead, Frank.
I'm going to go ahead and put it on Inertial neutral here and stay right on the horizon, if that's what precious wants.
Great ...
Say again.
That will be fine, Frank.
Okay.
Houston, this is Gemini VI. Propellant remaining is approximately 50 percent.
Roger. Copy. The OAMS remaining, 50 percent.
Gemini VI, Hawaii CAP COM.
Go.
Okay. We're showing you GO here on the ground. Can you give me your status?
We're in formation with VII and everything is GO here.
Roger. Congratulations! Excellent!
Thank you. A lot of fun.
You guys really are showing a ... of droop on those wires hanging there.
Stop ... it on me.
Where are they hanging from?
Well, Frank, it looks like it comes out at the separation between - it might be the Fiberglas. It's approximately - oh - 10 to 15 feet long.
The separation plane from the booster, right?
Affirmative.
That's exactly where you have one, too. It really belted around there when you were firing your thrusters.
Looks like about 8 or 9 feet long and double wire.
Right.
We're going to take a picture of it.
Gemini VI, Hawaii.
Go ahead, Hawaii.
I've got an update for you if you're not too busy to copy either - a short one.
I'll let Tom talk to you.
Okay.
Okay. Gemini VI ready to copy.
Okay. D-8 06 35 00; pass at Hawaii; Rev 4. D-8 08:10:00; pass at Hawaii; Rev 5. That's it.

Okay. Very good. You've got it.
VI and VII, Hawaii. We'll be standing by if you have anything for us.
There just seems to be a little traffic up here, that's all.
Call a policeman.
It was pretty trying during the terminal run. As we looked out, we could see the two Gemini stars casting off to the right of Gemini VI - correction - VII. They were all in a line.
Roger.
We've lost you, VI.
You've lost sight of me, sir?
Roger.
I must affirm a few little things.
Okay.
Keep to your left now.
This is the night light, is it?
Say again.
This doesn't act like a night light, or is that an experiment light?
No. They should both be off.
VI, what's your range?
20 feet.
Roger.
The flag or the letters are ... Looks like they're seared as much at launch as they are when you come back from reentry.
Jim, noticed your blue field is practically burned off.
Right.
Gemini VI, Houston.
Go ahead, Elliot.
Do you have an estimate of your TPI fuel and braking fuel?
Roger. Stand by.
Gemini VI, we're interested in Delta-V's on the terminal phase initiation and the braking, and also several million people are interested in a little more description of the braking and your stationkeeping.
Roger, Elliot. Gemini VI. We've initiated with a Delta-V that was 031 forward. It started initially at 007 up and decreased to 004 up at initiation and right 001. At the completion of TPI we had 62 percent fuel remaining.
Roger.
And now for the big questions.
We have about 49 now, Elliot.
Roger. 49 percent now.
That's affirmative. Our first stick course was 007 forward, 005 left, and 007 up. The final mid-course was 004 forward, 06 right, and 003 up. This pretty much conforms with the plot. We're a little bit below the nominal line there - of the plot at that time. In the braking, we knocked up 27 feet per second Delta-V with our brakings. There's 27 feet per second aft - a total of about 14 left.
Roger. 27 feet per second aft and about 14 left.
Roger. 14 left was the final one.
Roger.
And we will hit position at 120 feet per. We have indicating 50 percent fuel.
Roger. Copy.
R-dots, all the way through, looked fairly nominal and the one backup solution that I did get for the mid-course reads very close with the closed loop.
Roger, Tom.
Right now, we are SEF VII and BEF and we're - oh, I'd say what - 10 feet apart.
Roger. About that.
Yes.
Say again, your range, VI.
About 10 feet.

Gemini VII and VI, would you continue with the description of your stationkeeping?
Right now, VI is about 10 feet above and to the left of VII. We're just flying nose to nose, approximately 15 feet apart.
Roger.
We can very clearly see the horizon scanners up ...
Wally, I can see your lateral thrusters are firing out about 40 feet from what we - visual, from what we can see.
How are they doing?
We can't tell now. We're in too close. But when you were doing your Braking Maneuver we could see them ... quite a bit out.
I'll come back in, so we can get nose-to-nose a little bit.
Looks like those wires guillotined off the booster and not at the spacecraft ...
Yes, you have the same thing, only it's in back of yours.
The wire bundles, of course.
Gemini VI, did I understand you to report that thruster plumes were seen 40 feet out?
That was Gemini VII, and I'm sure they saw them that far. We could see them; looks like within a ... down with them.
Houston, on this Braking Maneuver our lateral thrusters fire quite a ways out.
Roger, VII.
Yes. What's confusing?
Gemini VI, would you switch your adapter C-Band to COMMAND?
Gemini VI, adapter to COMMAND.
What did you say, Wally?
You guys sure have big deals.
Ha! ha! ha!
If you're in white, you're in style.
Right.
Gemini VI, Houston.
Go ahead, Elliot.
On that update at Hawaii, those remarks of the pass at Hawaii, Rev 4 and Rev 5, actually do not apply to you. Those were instructions to Hawaii.

How's the food supply holding out?
Oh, it's in good shape.
It's holding out, but it's the same thing day after day.
... point off. Right, yes.
We picked you up, Wally, when the sun reflected off your adapter.
Yes.
Wally, is it good to see the lights on final?
Affirmative. It's good.
Okay.
At what range could they see?
Usually just before transfer, but the ...
This is on the long range ... transfer.
Roger.
Gemini VI, have you been doing any In-Plane Fly-Around?
No, I've been just looking around. We're trying to get ready for a night pass here ...
Roger.
Hey Wally!
Go ahead.
When we get around to the next stateside let us try it for about 5 minutes, will you? I'm after - the fuel is bouncing up a little bit.
Sure.
Okay.
I'm going to platform for the nighttime pass, if you want to back off just a little bit.
When I get in there you're going to leave the platform up?
Yes, we're going to leave it up.
Okay.
That will help you there, Frank, or ... back a little more?
That's okay. I ... in the plat mode now.
Roger.
... on the line right now.
Roger.
This gauge is bouncing right around 15 percent if you look at it right. ... to the left ...
Oh, good. I think we better pitch over.
Gemini VI, Gemini VI, Houston CAP COM. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Houston. Go ahead.
Could you give us a report on your night stationkeeping?
No trouble at all. We're about 20 feet apart, using the docking lights and the cabin lights of the spacecraft.
Roger. Understand no trouble at all. 20 feet apart. Using the docking lights on VI.
We're using the docking lights from VI to illuminate - -
Roger, understand. Docking lights on VI to illuminate VII.

Did you wipe your mouth, Jim, after you ate?
You must have just wiped your mouth, Jim. Did you?
Yes. Right.
How's the visibility through these windows? They're pretty bad from this side.
Yes. It's pretty bad. We noticed ... that some see through the windows. They are pretty bad on this side.
Through your window, they're right on top of us.
Gemini VI, Houston. We'd like a report on whether you have done a Fly-Around yet on the day side.
Negative. We canceled that to get the ...

Roger. 47 percent remaining.
The forest fires really kick them out, don't they, Jim?
Right. They've been there all the time, Wally.
Yes. That fire down there to your left is an oil fire, I think.
Oh, you see one there from the air?
Right. Maybe that was down to your left. It's ... night.
Okay.

Yes, that's obvious to us, yes.
We wanted to roll about 180 degrees to the right or left and to get that blob of ice in the sun.
Okay.
Try out the water boiler outlet.
180 degrees to the right. How's that?
Fine.
Gemini VI, Hawaii CAP COM.
Gemini VI.
Okay. I've got your Sep Maneuver update if you're ready to copy.
Stand by.
VI is ready.
Okay. Radar and track and solid telemetry on both vehicles. Okay. We're showing you GO here on the ground. And here we go: GET B; 11 plus 14 plus 29; Delta-V, 9 feet per second; burn time, 0 plus 15; yaw 00, pitch 00; Core 25, 90090; Cores 26 and 27 are all zeros; and it will be a forward firing thruster burn; Retrograde Maneuver.
Roger. The separation is 11 plus 14 plus 29; Delta-V, 9.0 feet per second; duration, 0 plus 15; yaw 0, pitch 0; Core 25, 90090; 26 and 27, all zeros; thruster is forward-firing; retrograde burn.
Okay, Tom. You got it all and here's what we'd like you to do prior to making the burn. We'd like you to move 5 to 10 feet north of Spacecraft VII and about 50 feet behind. This is prior to making the burn. Now the reason for this is to keep the Spacecraft VII D-4/D-7 instrument away from the sun.
Affirmative.
Are you worried about us getting between the sun and him?
That's what it looks like.
We've never been there, we watched out for that.
Okay, Wally, that's where they'd like you to go just prior to making the burn. Okay?
Okay. I'll just try to keep our shadow off of him all this time.
Roger. Very good. You will be having the UHF 6 over the RKV.
Roger.
Gemini VI, Hawaii.
... that's a fine place to start to burn some, Wally. I think they just did not want the IR sensor pointing into the sun.
Got you, Frank.
I have both eyes on your water boiler outlet ... looks like a small ... about the size of a tube.
Okay, VI and VII. We'll see you tomorrow.
Thank you.
Roger. Good show here.

Roger, and VI on your OAMS status, your fuel remaining is 148 pounds; oxidizer remaining, 193 pounds. Our calculations show that to be an actual 43 percent remaining on propellant, and that was calculated prior to your last sep burn.
... I cut you out. Would you say again after quantity?
Roger. Did you copy the fuel and oxidizer remaining?
No.
Okay. Propellant quantity remaining actual, 43 percent.
Roger. Understand 43 percent. We're reading about 32.

... looks like a very easy pass ...
Roger.
Australia, we're all ready for it and ... both day and night station ... no difficulty at all.
Roger.
Pressure's now pulse mode and platform on.
Roger.
We didn't have any trouble. We were pulsing all around looking at ...
Sounds like fun.
Sure is.
Got a bunch of pretties running around the back of that thing.
Did you get some good pictures?
Oh, we sure hope so. We snapped about ... four rolls of color about 50 ... Hasselblad.
Roger. Have a good night's sleep. I feel like a baby sitter. I tuck you in every night, and now I'm baby sitting for four of you.

Your cuff is full-scale.
We have a valid blood pressure. Standing by for a food and water report.
Gemini VI, standing by for your food and water report.
Also like to get a cabin temp reading and your suit inlet temp reading.
Roger. On the food and water report, both Pilots have consumed two meals. We'll add up the water for you in a minute. Cabin temperature, 84. The suit temperature was 58.
Roger. I'd like to get a propellant quantity remaining and an OAMS source pressure.
32 percent indicated propellant quantity. OAMS source temperature is 70 degrees; psi is 1650.
Copy. 1650.
We have a valid oral temp on Command Pilot.
Okay, at your convenience we'd like you to run a cabin temp survey and just record it in your log book for post-flight. We'd like the cabin's ambient dry and wet bulb, suit inlet dry and wet bulb. Remove the blue nozzle and check directly in the O2 flow. If possible, we'd like a hatch surface temperature and side wall surface temperature.
Okay. We're going to relax after a hard day's work. You'll get that jazz sometime tomorrow.
That's affirmative. At your convenience.
Okay.
I'd like your evaluation of your posigrade burn.
No residual.
Roger.
Carnarvon CAP COM, Gemini VI.
Gemini VI, Carnarvon. Go ahead.

Okay, Tape Recorder Power circuit breaker on.
Tape Recorder Power circuit breaker on.
Okay, place your Tape Playback switch to the RESET position, momentarily, then beck to COMMAND.
Put the RESET to COMMAND.
Gemini VI, Carnarvon. Seems like we've got the same problem with your tape recorder as we had on VII. If you can reach it, try to tap it. Maybe we can get the tape motion.
I thought I had this trouble with ... Station before.
Copy.
Right. Okay, stand by VI. I'm going to VII now and get a purge.
Roger.
Gemini VI, Carnarvon.
Gemini VI. Go.
Okay, I have some instructions for you. Okay, you can power up. I would like to bring your computer up, and bring you up to power, and bring your radar up to standby; after 5 minutes turn radar on and copy radar readings every 10 minutes, between Carnarvon and US.
What we want there is range, pitch and time.
Okay. We've got our computer on, it's in PRELAUNCH. Turned radar on at 42 minutes elapsed time.
Roger. What we want off your radar is your time, range and pitch.
On Spacecraft VII?
That's affirm. We already turned the transponder on.
Okay, he'll be aft of me. That's correct, right?
That is affirm.
Okay, we'll get to look at you all now; we're purging.
Also I have a flight plan update for you, whenever you're ready to copy.
Are you ready to copy, VI?
That's affirmative. Go ahead.
Okay. Time 22 25 06; crew status report at Carnarvon. That completes the update; it was just a short item. Can you position your Cryo Gaging switch to ECS O2, please?
Roger. ECS O2. At 22 25 06 crew status at Carnarvon.
At Carnarvon ... two.
Carnarvon, Gemini VI.
Go ahead VI.
Roger. I checked the Command Pilot. One Actyfed pill at 35 minutes past 21 hours. That's from nasal congestion.
Can you repeat, please?
Roger. I took one Actyfed (Spell Actyfed) pill at 21 hours 35 minutes.
Roger. We copy. Okay, you can turn your Cryo Gaging switch back to OFF, VI.
Roger. We're going around to pick up VII.
Gemini VI, Houston.
Gemini VI, Gemini VI, Houston.
This is Gemini VI. Go.
Roger, Gemini VI. Request that you kick the tape recorder. We feel that the tape might be out of the limits which, by kicking it, we might get good tape operation.
Roger. I'll kick my foot.
Also, we'd request any range, elevation, and time that you may have gotten by now from the line of sight to Gemini VII.
Roger. We have a lock-on now, ... at 21 50 we had a range of 22.24 nautical miles ... at 22 plus 00 we had a range of 17.63 nautical miles and we still have a positive lock-on. At 51 we have a range of 16.0 nautical miles.
Roger. Read back, Gemini VI.
Roger. 21 50, we have a range of 22.24 nautical miles; at 22:00, we have a range of 17.63 nautical miles.
Roger, Gemini VI.
... VII.
Gemini VI, Texas CAP COM. We'd like to remind the Command Pilot to put the oral temp probe in his mouth at this time.
You just ruined a good breakfast.
Sorry.
Go ahead.
Hello, Houston, this is Gemini VI with the water, food and sleep reports.
Roger. Gemini VI, Houston Surgeon. Go ahead.
Roger. Command Pilot has a total of 129 half-ounce drinks and three meals, Pilot has 113 half-ounce drinks and three meals.
Roger. Copy three meals apiece, one with 129 half-ounce drinks and one with 113 half-ounce drinks for the Command Pilot and Pilot, respectively. Can you give us a report on your sleep?
We slept approximately 5 hours apiece.
How good?
Gemini VI, Houston Surgeon. Would the Pilot send us a blood pressure while we're waiting for the Command Pilot's oral temp?
Roger. Houston, double purge complete on Section 2.
Roger on double purge complete on Section 2.
Place your Fuel Cell Control 2 circuit breaker off.
Roger. Completed.
Repeat Step 5. Open -
Cuff is full-scale, VI.
Open-circuit readouts on 2A, 2B, and 2C voltage.
Open-circuit voltage readouts on 2A, 2B, and 2C are all off-scale high, about 32 volts.
Put back on line.
Roger. Section 2 coming back on-the-line.
Command Pilot VI, oral temp valid.
After 10 minutes, Crossover off.
Houston, Section 2 back on-the-line and Crossover still on.
Gemini VI Pilot, blood pressure valid. Command Pilot blood pressure. We're standing by.
Roger.
Gemini VI, Houston. Place your Tape Recorder Power circuit breaker off.
VI has Power Recorder circuit breaker off.
I'm sorry, that's an error. Place your Tape Recorder Control circuit breaker off.
Roger. Control off.
VII, this is VI. Would you flip on your acquisition lights again for me, please?
Cuff is full-scale, CP.
Acquisition on, VI.
Roger.
Command Pilot VI, pump your cuff up again; you've pulled your bulb off.
Cuff is full-scale.
Gemini VI, Houston. We'll be standing by for any time, range and, if possible, Address 59 Theta readouts, between you and VII.
Roger, Houston. ... get the word on the Theta, - we have the range.
Roger. We request to have that information, please.
Roger. The range at 20 - at our GET of 21 50 00 plus 22.24. The range 22 plus 00 plus 00 was 17.63. The range at 22 plus 12 plus 00 was 18.33. The range at 22 plus 20 plus 00 was 19.55. The range at 22 plus 30, range was 26.31.
Roger, Gemini VI. Can you tell me if the Spacecraft VII is above your altitude or below your altitude?
He is above our altitude.
He was above you when you got those readings?
That is affirmative, and I have him in sight with reflected lights here.
You have him in sight with reflected light?
That's affirmative.
We have both high ACQ lamps of reflected light.
Can you give me an estimation of the elevation angle - -?
... got for you but we want to get cleaned up in here; to track him only proves that we're able to rendezvous and we've done that. We'd like to get the cockpit stowed fairly soon here.
Roger.
So we know what radar range and Theta is already. You want to give us an update on what the real retro time is?
Gemini VI, Houston. Understand. Will you have any non-nominal stowage?
We're considering leaving the water bags in the right aft box and not changing them to the left-hand box; otherwise, they will be identical.
Roger. Water bags in the right aft as opposed to the left aft box.
That is correct. They will be where they were for launch.
Roger. Same place that they were in launch. And I'd like to reverify that, at the time these readings were taken, Gemini VII was above you.
That's affirmative.
Thank you very much, Gemini VI.
Roger. 4 or 5 degrees above. We can see them now.
4 or 5 degrees above; thank you very much.
We're trying - would you give us an update on our 17-1 retrofire time, just so we can prep up to it?
Roger.
14 53 21 GMT. GET is 25 15 55. Gemini VI, Houston. Did you copy?
Roger. We have a GMT of 14 plus 53 plus 51. GET RC at 25 plus 15 plus 55.
Roger. That GMT is 14 53 21. Your GET is correct.
Roger. Gemini out.
Gemini VI, Houston. Please verify Tape Recorder Power circuit breaker on. Tape Recorder Control circuit breaker off.
That is affirmative. Our Tape Recorder Power is on, Control is off.
Thank you very much, Tom.
Gemini VI, Houston Surgeon. You noticing some effect from the Actyfed yet?
I'm using less Kleenex. I miss also not being able to ... during the early morning reveille.
Roger, Gemini VI.
We should ..., but we're doing okay.
Roger. Copy, VI.
Good morning, Captain Schirra.
Good morning, Chris. That was a ball!
You're doing great. Let's put it down on the elevator.
Number 3 or Number 2?
Your choice.
Roger. We'll try them both.
Stand by. We'll have to change the targeting.
... getting set up for that rendezvous.
... or we'll be on the boat.
Roger.
VI, VII.
Go ahead, Jim.
Want to wager who gets closest?
...
I need some payola there.
We're going to make the bet out of contact with ground stations.
Gemini VI, Canary.
Roger. Radar coming off.
Very, very good. We'd like your computer in PRELAUNCH.
Roger. Going there. It's in PRELAUNCH.
Roger. Thank you.
Sorry we don't have too much for you there, VI.
We really regret that on those fuel cells.
We copy that.
Good show, Canaries.
Roger. Thank you.

Roger ... that first ...
Say again, Gemini VI.
... make the reentry charts up ...
Gemini VI, Carnarvon CAP COM. You're breaking up on us. Could you say again, please?
Roger, Roger. On these updates here, we didn't receive that. How about going real slow with it. Okay?
Roger. Say again. For Area 17-1 bank angle 00 degrees; the RN minus RP will be a plus 107; second reading - bank angle, 44 degrees; the RN, RP will be 0; third one - at 90 degrees bank angle, RN minus RP will be a minus 197. Do you copy?
Roger. I copy on 17-1 bank angle 00 degrees; RN minus RP, plus 107; bank angle of 44 degrees; RN minus RP, 0; 90-degree bank angle; RN, RP, minus 197.
That's affirmative.
You're looking good from the ground.
Roger. We're just completing some of our major stowage jobs.
Gemini VI, Hawaii CAP COM.
Go ahead, Hawaii.
How are you doing this morning?
Real good. Just about squared away for retro.
Very good. We show you GO here on the ground and I don't have anything for you, Gemini VI.
Negative ... all that stuff was done coming across the States.
Roger. Understand. If you need anything, give me a shout.
Okay. Thank you, Hawaii.
Gemini VII, Gemini VI. Can you see us?
Negative.
Sure can't.
You can now, can't you?
No. Sure can't, Wally.
We're in the light. We'll put the docking light on.
We're just drifting. I don't know which way we're looking at.
Okay.
Gemini VI, Gemini VI. Place your ... on, please.
Roger. They're on.
Roger.
Roger, Houston.
Gemini VII, this is Gemini VI. We have an object, looks like a satellite going from north to south, probably in a polar orbit. He's in a very low trajectory traveling from north to south and has a very high climbing ratio. It looks like it might even be a ... Very low. Looks like he might be going to reenter soon. Stand by one ... You might just let me try to pick up that thing.
We got them too, VI.
That was live, VII, not tape.
You're too much, VI!
...
Gemini VI. Stand by for an update on your computer for a retro. Are you ready to accept it?
Gemini VI. Affirmative. We are in PRELAUNCH.
Roger. You're ready.
Elliot ... updated your book. We moved out of PRELAUNCH to CATCH-UP and then back to PRELAUNCH.
Roger. We'll send it again.
Affirmative.
Gemini VI. I'm ready to give you a readout on the MDIU quantities so that you can check them. Are you ready to copy?
Stand by one second, will you?
Gemini VI is ready to copy.
Roger. Address 03, 38549; Core 04, 61388; Core 05, 07513; Core 66, 65384; Core 07, 35999; Core 08, 40014. Are you copying, VI?
Got all through 6, you faded out on 7. Repeat for 7 on. You faded out.
Roger, Tom. Core 07, 35999; Core 08, 40014; Core 09, 12421; Core 10, 02346; Core 11, 29217. Do you copy?
Roger. Copied all of them. We'll check the MDIU.
Okay. Why don't you read back those real quick, Tom?
Roger. 03 is 38549; 04 is 61388; 05 is 07513; Core 66, 65384; 07, 35999; 08, 40014; 09, 12421; Core 10, 02346; Core 11, 29217.
Roger, Tom. For your information, our T/M verifies this, and we have run out a solution and it looks good. Would you read 03 back? I was interrupted. I did not get your read-back. I think it was correct.
Roger. 03 is 38549.
Roger. They all check, Tom.
We'll give her a go.
I've got an Area 17-1 update for you also.
When you're ready to copy.
Go.
GET RC 25 15 58; RET 400K; 20 plus 15. RET RB 26 plus 38, bank left 55. Do you copy?
Roger ... GET RC 25 15 58; RET 400K, 20 plus 15; reverse bank, 26 plus 38; bank left 55 degrees.
Roger. That's correct, VI.
Gemini VI, we want to try another tape dump here, just one more try. Would you place your Tape Recorder Control circuit breaker on, and verify the Tape Recorder Power circuit on?
Roger. Tape Recorder on, Control circuit breakers are on.
Roger.
Houston, Gemini VI. All cores check satisfactorily.
Very good, VI.
Gemini VI, Houston. How are you coming on the retro preparations? Getting everything stowed away?
Roger. We have one camera out and we'll throw it down in the box when we're all finished up.
Very good. Don't let that satellite get away from you.
You sure did let it get away from him.
Gemini VI. We have no joy on your tape dump. We'd like you to place the Tape Recorder Power circuit breaker off and leave the Control circuit breaker on.
Roger. Power off, Control on.
Roger, Tom.
Houston, Gemini VI. Do you have the latest ... readouts for the nominal?
You're very weak, VI. Say again.
Roger. Do you have the latest nominal IVI rate with the readouts?
They're the same as we gave you on preflight. The 308 number.
Houston, this is Gemini VI. I'm going to suggest ... stowed.
Say again, Tom. You were just a little fast there. Something about stowage.
Roger. Give us the IVI coverage again. It still doesn't look right.
Roger. It's 308 amps - - stand by.
And 117 down.
Roger. Copy 308 amps and 117 down.
Roger.
Tananarive, Gemini VI. Request a time hack on GET.
Roger, Gemini VI. This is Tananarive. On my Mark it will be 14:14:30.

Roger. The recovery is .5 cloud cover, 10 miles vis, 3 knots and 360 degrees from the north, seas are 3 feet and very light, barometer 30.06.
That's affirmative. We'd also like to have you close the Tape Recorder Power circuit breaker and make sure that the Tape Playback switch is in the COMMAND position.
Power circuit breaker is closed and in the COMMAND position. Could you give us a hack on our GET?
Roger. Let's see, you're at 24 hours and 54 minutes and approximately 35 minutes, 35 seconds.
Can you give us the Mark at 53 45?
MARK. 53 45.
Roger. We're right on it.
Roger. We've got about 2 minutes to your 20-minute mark on your event timer.
Check.
Gemini VI, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Go ahead.
During retrofire go ahead and use both rings. After retrofire turn Ring B off and do not use it, only Ring A, unless both rings are required for attitude control.
Roger. That's what I wanted to do.
Roger. They do not want you to dump it after drogue deploy.
You mean leave the fuel in the lines?
That's affirmative.
Ten seconds. 3, 2, 1.
MARK.
I'm with you.
Roger. Your TR is right in sync with the ground.
Flight says on the Ring B clear the lines, but leave the motor valves off.
Roger, that's an OFF position, right?
Roger.
Carnarvon, our final PQI reading is 29 percent. This is Gemini VI.
Roger, VI.
Gemini VI, Carnarvon CAP COM. We'll have LOS shortly. You are looking good here on the ground. We'll see you back at the ranch.
Roger. Thanks for all your help. We've had a good day.
Roger. It was our pleasure. Carnarvon bids you good-bye.
Roger. I'd like to come and see you someday.
Gemini VI, Gemini VI, Houston CAP COM. How do you read?
This is Gemini VI, loud and clear.
Roger. Can you confirm TR minus 4 plus 16 check list complete?
Affirmative.
Roger. Standing by for countdown.
Both rings are ...
We didn't copy that, VI.

Gemini VI, I'll give you a time hack to start your counting-up test. Plus 3 minutes and about 15 seconds.
Roger. I feel like I need them.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
MARK.
Roger.
Okay, you all squared away?
All set here, thank you.
Okay. Did you get retrojett?
That's affirmative. I called that out. I guess I had no hack time at that point.
Okay, very good.
Right on time.
Roger.
