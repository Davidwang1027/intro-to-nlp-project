Roger, Friendship Seven.
This is Friendship Seven. I had a big storm in sight off to the south, of course, for a little while and had lightning flashes going around on top of the clouds. I could see it very clearly. Over.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. Opening visor, going to eat. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
This is Friendship Seven. Having no trouble at all eating, very good. In the periscope, I can see the brilliant blue horizon coming up behind me; approaching sunrise. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. You are very lucky.
You're right. Man, this is beautiful
This is Friendship Seven. Have eaten one tube of food, shutting the visor. I've had no problem at all eating. Oh, the sun is coming up behind me in the periscope, a brilliant, brilliant red. Over.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. It's blinding through the scope on clear. It's started up just as I gave you that mark; I'm going to the dark filter to watch it come on up.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. I'll try to describe what I'm in here. I am in a big mass of some very small particles, that are brilliantly lit up like they're luminescent. I never saw anything like it. They round a little; they're coming by the capsule, and they look like little stars. A whole shower of them coming by.
They swirl around the capsule and go in front of the window and they're all brilliantly lighted. They probably average maybe 7 or 8 feet apart, but I can see them all down below me, also.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Can you hear any impact with the capsule? Over.
Negative, negative. They're very slow; they're not going away from me more than maybe 3 or 4 miles per hour. They're going at the same speed I am approximately. They're only very slightly under my speed. Over.
They do, they do have a different motion, though, from me because they swirl around the capsule and then depart back the way I am looking.
Are you receiving? Over.
There are literally thousands of them.
This is Friendship Seven. Am I in contact with anyone? Over.
This has been going on since about 1 plus 15. Over. Just after I remarked about the sunset. I looked back up and looked out the window, and all the little swirl of particles was going by. Over.
This is Friendship Seven. This is Friendship Seven, broadcasting in the blind again on HF.
This is Friendship Seven, broadcasting in the blind. Sunrise has come up behind in the periscope. It was brilliant in the scope, a brilliant red as it approached the horizon and came up; and just as the--as I looked back up out the window, I had literally thousands of small, luminous particles swirling around the capsule and going away from me at maybe 3 to 5 miles per hour. Now that I am out in the bright sun, they seem to have disappeared. It was just as the sun was coming up. I can still see just a few of them now, even though the sun is up some 20° above the horizon.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven. This is Guaymas Com Tech, Guaymas Com Tech, transmitting on HF-UHF. Do you read? Over.
Hello, Guaymas Com Tech, Guaymas Com Tech. This is Friendship Seven. Receive your HF loud and clear. How me? Over.

This is Friendship Seven. I still have some of these very small particles coming around the capsule. Over.
Friendship Seven, Guaymas Cap Com. Say again, please. Over.
This is Friendship Seven. Just as the sun came up, there were some brilliantly-lighted particles that looked luminous, that were swirling around the capsule. I don't have any in sight right now; I did have a couple just a moment ago, when I made the transmission to you. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
This is Friendship Seven. For the record, number, the number two film that I'm putting in the camera is the number four roll.

Roger, 04 plus 32 plus 40 for Hotel.
Friendship Seven, Guaymas. If you have a chance, could you give us a blood pressure check? Over.
Roger. Friendship Seven. Will give blood pressure check. I still have some of these particles that I cannot identify coming around the capsule occasionally. Over.
Roger. How big are these particles?
Very small, I would indicate they are on the order of 16th of an inch or smaller. They drift by the window and I can see them against the dark sky. Just at sunrise there were literally thousands of them. It looked just like a myriad of stars. Over.
Roger. Are they moving by you or floating with you? Over.
Some of them almost float with me. Most of them appear to be moving at about 3 to 5 miles an hour away from me. I'm going just a little faster then they are. Over.
Roger.
Friendship Seven, Guaymas Cap Com. We have a scope retract indication on ground. Believe it's ground failure. Over.
That is affirmative. The scope is extended. The scope is extended. Over.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. A lot of cloud cover. I cannot see land yet. Over.
This is Friendship Seven. Yaw is drifting out of orbit attitude and will bring it back in. Over.
Roger.
Friendship Seven, Guaymas. I said the, I have an indication of scope retract. Your say your scope is out, though? Over.
That is affirmative.
Roger.
Friendship Seven, California Cap Com. We have your scope as extended.
That is affirmative, Cal, scope is extended.
Roger, we concur here.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. Yaw drifted out of limits about 20 degrees to the right. I'm bringing it back in manually at present time. Over.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. Back on ASCS.
Friendship Seven, Guaymas. You were on ASCS when it started drifting out. Over.
That is affirmative.
This is Friendship Seven. Now on fly-by-wire to hold orbit attitude.
This is Friendship Seven. I have the land in sight out the window. Controlling manually, on fly-by-wire.
Friendship Seven. Is the ASCS OK now? Over.
I'll switch back on to it now and see.
This is Friendship Seven. Negative. Seems to, well, standby one.
This is Friendship Seven. Affirmative. Seems to be controlling now. There may be some drift to the right, however. Over.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. It drifts about out 20° to the right and then gets a large pulse to kick it back over to the left. It goes in about, the rate runs over to about 3 degrees per second, to the left.
It's drifting again in yaw. Over. And once again pulls through.
Cape Com Tech. Do you read? Over.
Roger, Cape Com Tech. Friendship Seven. Over.
Hello, Cape Com Tech. Friendship Seven. Over.
Friendship Seven, this is Cape Com Tech, Cape Com Tech. Do you read? Over.

Hello, Cape Com Tech. Friendship Seven. Over.
Friendship Seven, this is Canaveral Com Tech. How do you copy? Over.
Friendship Seven to Canaveral. Read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
Friendship Seven, Canaveral Com Tech. Read you loud and clear. Standby for Cap Com. Over.
Roger.
Friendship Seven, Cap Com. Would you give us the difficulty you've been having in yaw in ASCS? Over.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven. I'm going on fly-by-wire so I can control more accurately. It just started as I got to Guaymas, and appears to be it drifts off in yaw, to the right at about 1° per second. It will go over to an attitude of about 20°, and hold at that and when it hits about a 20° point it then goes into orientation mode and comes back to zero, and it was cycling back and forth in that mode. I am on fly-by-wire now and controlling manually. Over.
Roger. Understand. Do you have a retrofire time for 2 Bravo and 2 Charlie?
This is Friendship Seven. Negative.
OK, 2 Bravo, 00:01:50:00; 2 Charlie, 00:02:05:59. Over.
Ah, this is Friendship Seven. Understand 1 Bravo is 01 plus 50 plus 00; 2 Charlie, correction 2 Bravo is 00:01:50:00, 2 Charlie is 02 plus 05 plus 59. Is that affirm?
That is affirmative. Standby one, please.
This is Friendship Seven. What appears to have happened is, I believe, I have no one pound thrust in left yaw. So it drifts over out of limits and then hits it with the high thrust. Over.
Roger, Seven, we concur here. Recommending you remain fly-by-wire.
Roger, remaining fly-by-wire.
Seven, this is Cape. The President will be talking to you and while he is talking I'll be sending Z and R cal.
Ah - President.
Go ahead, Mr. President.

During the first part of the flight, when I had trouble over the west coast of the United States, I had a problem with the yaw, with no low thrust to the left; now I have thrust in that direction but do not have low thrust to the right. When the capsule drifts out in that area, it hits high thrust and drops into orientation mode, temporarily. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. This is Zanzibar Cap Com. Continue with your 30-minute report. Over.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven. Thirty-minute report follows: Head movements cause no nausea or no bad feelings at all. I am surprised that I can look as close to the sun as I can; the sun is shining directly on my face at present time, and all I have to do is to shade my eyes with my eyebrow.

Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. Sun, I want to make a mark here when the sun goes down. Sun is on the horizon at the present time, a brilliant blue out from each side of it. And I'll give a mark at the last. The sun is going out of sighs. Ready now, MARK (2:09:06). There's a brilliant blue out on each side of the sun, horizon to horizon almost. I can see a thunderstorm down below me somewhere, and lightning.
And I am not night adapted right now, so I cannot see any of the zodiacal light.

Roger. Exhaust temperature?
Exhaust temperature 50 [degrees]. Over.
Roger. Are you in fly-by-wire?
Negative, I am on manual at present time. I'm down to 60 [percent] on automatic fuel, so I cut it off and I'm on manual at present time. Over.
Roger. How is your yaw thruster problem? Over.
This is Friendship Seven. I am getting some erratic indications in all axes. When I align everything on orbit attitude by the instruments I am considerably off where I should be. I'm rolled some 20° to the right; I'm also yawed to the right a little bit. Over.
Roger, understand. Are you satisfied with the fly-by-wire and manual proportional systems? Over.
Fly-by-wire is not functioning in yaw low right. Over.
Roger, low yaw right.
That's affirmative. When I first had trouble with it, it was malfunctioning in low yaw left, and now low yaw left is operating okay, but low yaw right is not operating. Over.
Roger. Have you tried caging your gyros and re-erecting them. What do you think about this? Over.
Negative, have not yet. I want to get an alignment as soon as I get back in daylight and do just exactly that. I think my, I'm probably not--my scanners are probably not working right. Over.
Roger. Will you confirm the Landing Bag switch is in the off position? Over.
That is affirmative. Landing Bag switch is in the center off position.
You haven't had any banging noises or anything of this type at higher rates?
Negative.
They wanted this answer. Do you have your retrosequence times 2 Dog, Easy, and Golf from Indian Ocean Ship?
Standby one. Yes, 2 Easy, and Golf, yes, I do have those.
Roger.
Do you have any, are you ready for Z and R Cal? Over.
Affirmative, go ahead.
Cal coming through.
Any comments on weightlessness, etc.
Negative, I have no ill effects whatsoever. I don't even really notice it now. I'm just, very comfortable.
Fine.

Go ahead, Woomera.
The Cape advises that you conduct this horizon check and cage the gyros, before California.
Say again, please, Woomera, did not understand.
Cape advises that you conduct this horizon check, and cage the gyros before California contact. Over.
Roger, understand before California contact.
Roger. Would like to confirm your control systems status, fly-by-wire low yaw right is inoperative.
That's affirmative.
Good in all axes. Over.
That is affirmative
Can you give status on your ASCS system? Over.
This is Friendship Seven. ASCS started out operating, it would drop into orientation mode in yaw and that would throw the other axes out. It was doing this for a while it world drift off slowly, yaw right and there would be no correction until it went out about 20° . Then it would come rapidly back across and correct itself from a 20° right attitude, would come back across to a left attitude in orientation mode. This continued for a while. I took control, that was right after Guaymas. By the time I had gone over Africa the condition had just reversed, had just reversed. The same thing, only the other direction. Over.
Roger, I understand.
Friendship Seven, if you're ready, could we conduct this 30 minute report? Over.
Friendship Seven. Roger. All switch fuses still same position. Squib is armed. Auto Retrojettison is off. ASCS mode selector is normal, rate command, gyro, normal. Manual fuel handle is pulled. Automatic fuel is still on. Retro-Delay, normal, Landing Bag is off. Everything else on sequence panel is normal. Fuel. ...
Could we have a blood pressure check? Start your button, then exercise the bungee cord, then start your blood pressure check again. Over.
Roger. Friendship Seven. Blood pressure coming on.
Roger, Friendship Seven. We're reading your blood pressure, what kind of result on your visual acuity test? Over.
Roger. Friendship Seven. Visual acuity still good. Can read same lines I did when starting out. Over.
Roger. Would like to go through this 30-minute report again, starting with the Auto Retro-jett switch. Go ahead.
Auto Retro-jettison is armed. I'm having to break this in the middle because I need to keep looking out the window to control accurately. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. ... discussion. Over.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. Auto Retro-jettison is off. ASCS mode selector is normal, rate command, gyro normal. All "T" handles are in except manual, and it is out. I am controlling manually at present time. Landing Bag switch is off. Sequence panel is all normal except for that. The control fuel is 60-82 [percent]. Attitudes at present time on manual control are roll 5 [degrees] right, yaw 15 [degrees] right, pitch --34 [degrees] in orbit attitude. My time from launch is 2 plus 33 plus 60, MARK! Correction that would be 2 plus 34 on that mark. Did you receive? Over.
Yes.
Roger. Cabin pressure is 5.5 and holding. Cabin air is 95 [degrees]. Cabin excess water light is still on. I'm turning it down a little bit more yet.
Cabin relative humidity is indicating 20 [percent]. Coolant quantity is 66 [percent]. Suit is 68 [degrees] on temperature, pressure 5.8 indicated, steam temperature, 50 [degrees] in suit circuit and comfortable. Oxygen is 65-100 [percent] amps 20. Voltages: main 24, 25, 25, 25; standby one is 25, 25; isolated 29; and back on main. Fans is 113, ASCS 113. I have two warning lights on, the excess cabin water and fuel quantity. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Aeromed would like to know whether you have conducted your exercise on bungee cord. Over.
Negative, I have not done that recently. Will conduct that now as part of this check. You had a blood pressure.
You are fading now. Standby for Canton in a few minutes. This is Woomera Cap Com, Over and Out.
Okay, exercise conducted. Blood pressure starting.
This is Friendship Seven. Woomera, are you still receiving me? Over.
This is Friendship Seven.
Friendship Seven, Canton Com Tech.
Hello Canton Com Tech. Friendship Seven. How did you receive UHF-HI? Over.
Friendship Seven, Canton Com Tech. Reading you loud and clear. Standby for Cap Com.
Roger. Canton Cap Com, Friendship Seven. Fuel 62-75 [degrees], oxygen 65-98 [percent], correction 65-100 [percent], amps 23. My condition is good. The sunrise is coming around the capsule right now. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. This is Canton. We have TM solid; go ahead, Over.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven, and now that the sunrise is starting, I have all these little particles coming around the capsule again, just at sunrise.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
I also can see the light on my, on steam from the thruster when I operate it. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Are, are your thrusters working, are all your high thrusters working okay. Over.
This Friendship Seven. Affirmative, operating okay.
This is Friendship Seven. I think my, I can see a little bit of steam spitting against the dark sky here occasionally from my pitch down manual thruster. Over.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. All these little particles; there are thousands of them; and they're not coming from the capsule. They're something that's already up there because they're all over the sky. Way out I can see them, as far as I can see in each direction almost.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
Friendship Seven, this is Canton. Our telemetry here indicates that everything is okay. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
Friendship Seven, this is Canton. Our Aeromed would like to hear any comments you have on weightlessness, nausea, dizziness, taste and smell sensations. Over.
Friendship Seven, I have no sensations at all from weightlessness except very pleasant. No ill effects at all, I'm not sick; feel fine. I have had no, no dizziness: I've run the head checks, the head movements and have no problem with that. I've run the oculogyric check and have no problem with that. I haven't been able to use much of the equipment this orbit, however. I've been mainly concerned with this control problem. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Our fuel quantities here agree with yours. Our 150 fans inverter temperature is 200 [degrees]. The ASCS temperature is 190 [degrees]. Out
Roger, Friendship Seven.
Friendship Seven, this is Canton. Do you have all the retro times that you need? Over.
This is Friendship Seven. I believe so. I have Foxtrot coming up here, I mean Golf coming up, at 00:03:00:39. Is that affirm?
Standby one.
This is Friendship Seven. I'm trying to get some pictures of these particles that are outside here. Over.
Friendship Seven, that time we have for Golf is 00:03:00:39. Over.
Roger.
Friendship Seven, this is Canton. We also have no indication that your landing bag might be deployed. Over.
Roger. Did someone report landing bag could be down? Over.
Negative, we had a request to monitor this and to ask you if you heard any flapping, when you had high capsule rates. ...
Negative.
... this was. Over.
Well, I think they probably thought these particles I saw might have come from that, but these are, there there are thousands of these things, and they go out for, it looks like miles in each direction from me and they move by here very slowly. I saw them at the same spot on the first orbit. Over.
Roger.
Friendship Seven, what control mode are you in presently?
This is Friendship Seven. I am in manual. While on the dark side, I aligned myself with the horizon, when up to 0 0 0, and caged the gyros and uncaged again. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Will be losing contact any minute now, you have reentry checks to make and approximately 10 minutes, until California contact. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
Friendship Seven, this is Hawaii Com Tech on UHF and HF. How do you read? Over.
Say again, Com Tech, what station?
Friendship Seven, Hawaii Com Tech on UHF and HF. How do you read? Over.
Hello Hawaii. Loud and clear; how me? Over.
Hello Hawaii. Friendship Seven. Loud and clear; how me? Over.
Friendship Seven, this is Hawaii Cap Com, I read you loud and clear. What is your status report? Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven, ah.
He has contact, we're putting air-to-ground on.
This is Friendship Seven. Fuel 62-74 [percent], oxygen 64-98 [percent], amps 23. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. The first part of your transmission was broken up; could you say again, fuel?
Roger, fuel 62-74 [percent]. Over.
Roger. Read 62-74 [percent], Friendship Seven. Cape would like to know if you have made the visual check on the gyros yet?
This is affirmative. During the dark side I went to 0 0 0 as best I could and caged and uncaged the gyros. I'm rechecking this at present time. Over.
Roger. I'll stand by until you complete your checks and we'd like to get the results.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
Hawaii, this is Friendship Seven. Are we getting scanner ignore? Over.
There are no ignore indications on the ground as of now, Friendship Seven. Hawaii. Over.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven. When I aligned in, standby one.
This is Friendship Seven. Roll appears to be about 20° off. At present time, I am indicating 20° right roll when I am lined up perfectly with the horizon. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Understand you still have a 20° error in your attitude indication after caging the gyros.
This is Friendship Seven. That's affirmative. It's drifted off again. It was correct at that time; it apparently has drifted off. It's about 20° off in roll.
Friendship Seven, could you give us a readout on all three axes; we'd like to compare ground readouts.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Roll indicates 19 [degrees] right, yaw, 2 [degrees] left, pitch --22 [degrees]. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Read you loud and clear.
Friendship Seven, Hawaii Cap Com. Can you estimate the drift rates you are getting?
This is Friendship Seven. Drift rates are very difficult to pick up for some reason. I have not been able to get real accurate drift rates. I feel that. ...
Do you still consider yourself GO for the next orbit?
That is affirmative, I am GO for the next orbit.
Roger, I understand. At present time ground concurs.
Roger.
Could you, could you give me a readout on exhaust temperature, please?
Friendship Seven. Roger. Exhaust temperature, 47 [degrees].
Friendship Seven, Hawaii Cap Com. Could you read exhaust temperature please?
Roger. Exhaust temperature 47 [degrees].
Roger. Understand 47 [degrees].
Surgeon requests a blood pressure readout if convenient at this time.
Roger 47 [degrees].
Correction, Roger, blood pressure, 47 [degrees] on steam temp, blood pressure on.
This is Friendship Seven. I have a pretty good run here on, on yaw check. I believe my yaw is pretty accurate. Roll is off by about 20° to the right at present time.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Roll is off by 20° to the right; yaw looks pretty good. Hawaii. Over.
That's affirmative.
Friendship Seven, Hawaii Cap Com. MCC confirms that they are GO at the present time for third orbit.
Roger. Friendship Seven.
Friendship Seven, Hawaii Cap Com. Do you read? Over.
Roger, Hawaii. Loud and clear, how me?
Are you ready to copy?
Friendship Seven. Go ahead.
This is Friendship Seven. I have a better alignment now on the day side, I believe, on these, on the attitude. I will probably cage and uncage gyros again. Over.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is California Com Tech, California Com Tech. Do you read? Over.
Roger, California Com Tech. Read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
Hello, California Com Tech. Friendship Seven. How me? Over.

Hello, California Com Tech. Friendship Seven. Loud and clear; how me?
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is California Com Tech, California Com Tech. Do you read? Over.
Hello, California Com Tech. Friendship Seven. Loud and clear; how me?
Friendship Seven, California Cap Com. Read you loud and clear, John.
Say again. You came in garbled that time. This is Friendship Seven.
Friendship Seven, this is California Cap Com. We read you loud and clear; how me?
Roger. Receiving you much better now, Wally. Very good. Fuel is 62-62 [percent], oxygen 62-95 [percent], amps are 25. All systems are still go. I have had some erratic ASCS operation. I caged and uncaged on the night side and it appears to be working fairly well now although I was drifting again in roll a moment ago. It appears to have corrected itself in roll, however, without me caging again now. Over.
Good, John. We have a go all the way on this. I'd like to give you your inverter temperatures. Your fans are 215 [degrees], your ASCS 198 [degrees]. We're not going to do anything about them. Looks real good.
Okay, fine.
Will you give me your attitudes and we'll check those with ground.
Roger. I'll go back into orbit attitude, drifting toward it at present time. Do you have TM solid now? Over.
Good here.
Roger. Roll is 5 [degrees] left, yaw 3 [degrees] right, pitch -- 32 [degrees], right now.
Roger, have your readings.
John, we check almost right on the button with your attitudes within 2°.
Roger. I appear to have a little bit of drift in the scope yet though.
Roger. You probably don't have a good reference yet, do you?
It's rather, it's more difficult to pick up drift than I thought it would be. Your best drift really is to look out the window and try and get something moving away from you out the window.
Roger, I've got you there.
You understand that your capsule elapsed time is running about a second slow compared to GET.
No, I did not; I was not aware of that on the elapsed time.
Roger. This will affect your sequence time. I'll give you 3 Alpha if you're ready to copy.
Standby.
Roger, ready to copy 3 Alpha.
Roger. 3 Alpha corrected for the second error will be 03 plus 11 plus 26. Over.
Roger, 00:03:11:26.
You have your end-of-orbit time, and that has not changed and I believe you have Area Golf also.
That's affirmative. I have Golf at 03 plus 00 plus 39 and Hotel at 04 plus 32 plus 40.
That is correct. You can correct your Area Golf by subtracting one second and subtract one second from Hotel.
Roger. Understand for my retrosequence for end-of-mission is 04 plus 32 plus 39. Is that affirm?
Negative. That should be 04 plus 32 plus 38.
Plus 38. Roger. Does Cape want me to set that into clock at present time? Over.
Negative, we have not had those instructions. I'll have Arnie check for you.
Roger. I am still operating on prelaunch time of 04 plus 32 plus 28. Over.
Understand.
This is Friendship Seven. Coming across the Gulf of Lower California at present time in the scope.
Roger.
John, for your information, the clocks will be set over Canaveral.
Roger, understand clocks will be set by command, is that affirm, or do they want...
That is negative. They, on contact with Al, they will have you change the clock.
Roger, understand. Friendship Seven.
For your information your O2 is holding. It seems to be working; it's reading about
Roger, Friendship Seven. Cabin temperature is holding steady at about 90 [degrees]. I still have excess cabin water light on and my, I have the cabin water turned almost completely off at present time.
Roger, it sounds like it's working out all right anyway.
Roger, it's doing okay. We'll make one more orbit okay.
I assume you are still on manual proportional; is that correct?
That's affirmative, I'm still on manual.
Friendship Seven, Guaymas Cap Com reads you loud and clear. Over.
Roger, Guaymas. Read you loud and clear, also.
John, the Aeromeds are real happy with you; you look real good up there.
Ali right, fine, glad everything is working out. I feel real good, Wally. No problems at all.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is Texas Com Tech. Do you read? Over.
Hello, Texas, this is Friendship Seven. Read you loud and clear. How me? Over.

Roger, Texas Cap Com. Loud and clear. How me?
Loud and clear. We have no queries down here. Continue with your observations please.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven. Systems all operating normally. I gave my quantities again. There's no need to waste more time on those. I am pitching down to about 60° to make observation. Over.
Roger, we confirm down here on the TM. Over.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. Just passed over El Paso in good shape. Could see town through some of the clouds, Over.
Friendship Seven, flying over complete cloud deck at present time.
I'm pitching down to 60° at present time. Orbit attitude in roll and yaw.
This is. ...
Canaveral Com Tech. How do you copy? Over.
Hello, Canaveral Com Tech. Friendship Seven. Loud and clear; how me?
Roger, Friendship Seven. This is Canaveral Com Tech. Copy you loud and clear, also. Standby for Cap Com please.

Roger, 00:03:22:26, for 3 Bravo. Is that affirm?
... 3 Charlie 00:03:40:18. Over.
Roger, 00:03:40:18 for 3 Charlie.
That is correct. At this time change your retro setting manually to 00:04:32:38. Over.
Roger, 04 plus 32 plus 38.
Roger, retrograde time is reset to 04 plus 32 plus 38. Over.
Roger, Seven. We recommend for the third orbit that you use gyros as you desire either normal or free so that in the event prior to retrofire on the third orbit that the scanners and ASCS do not program properly you may use your gyros in the free position for attitude reference. Over.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven. I have a fair, pretty good line-up now on the gyros, I believe. The check that I made on the night side was okay but they drifted off again, apparently rather rapidly in fact. I got another check on it and they seem to have corrected back pretty good now. I did not have to cage them again. Over.
Roger, Seven, we understand. The only problem is that you may not have enough light time prior yo retrofire.
Roger.
Let the gyros work in the free position if you desire. Over.
Roger. Friendship Seven.
Also, Seven, we recommend that you allow the capsule to drift on manual control in order to conserve fuel. Over.

Friendship Seven, this Bermuda Cap Com. We read you loud and clear.
Roger, Bermuda. Hear you loud and clear also.
Seven, this is Cape. Over.
Go ahead, Cape.
Correct your 3 Bravo time to 00:03:22:22. Over.
Roger, 00:03:22:22 for 3 Bravo.
Well, Seven, I'm having trouble, the seconds should be 32. Over.
Roger, 00:03:22:32.
Good Show.
Roger. Roger.
Hello Bermuda. Friendship Seven. It's over to you. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. We have nothing for you, you're in good shape.
Roger, this is Friendship Seven. I have the Cape in sight down there. It looks real fine from up here.
Rog. Rog.
As you know.
Yea, verily, Sonny.
This is Friendship Seven, Flor-, I can see the whole state of Florida just laid out like on a map. Beautiful.
Very good.
Even from this position out here, I can still see clear back to the Mississippi Delta.
This is Friendship Seven, checking down in Area Hotel on the weather and it looks good down that way. Looks like we'll have no problem on recovery.
Very good. We'll see you in Grand Turk.
Yes, Sir.
In fact, I can see clear down, see all the islands clear down that whole chain from up here, ... I can see way beyond them and area Hotel looks excellent for recovery.
Friendship Seven, Bermuda Cap Com.
Go ahead, Bermuda.
Cape recommends that you reenter on ASCS with manual for backup.
Roger, this is Friendship Seven. Understand recommend ASCS with manual backup.
This, this operation of ASCS has been very erratic. I have not been able to pin it down to any particular, one particular item. It went off one direction in yaw at one time; it went off the other the next time. I felt for a little while that pitch was drifting. It seemed to have a little stuck thrust in pitch at one time and I have to keep correcting that and that corrected itself and then I was off in roll just after I came off the dark side this time. Over.
Roger, understand. I have all that down. Could you give us a blood pressure please?
Roger. Standby.
Friendship Seven, can you give me both your primary and secondary oxygen?
Roger, primary oxygen is 62 [percent], secondary is 94 [percent].
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. I'm letting it drift a little bit to the right here to look up north.
Friendship Seven, Bermuda Cap Com.
Go ahead Bermuda.
Your fans inverter temperature is 205 [degrees] and your ASCS temperature is 195 [degrees].
Roger, sounds real good, Gus, fine.
You're in good shape.

Friendship Seven, this is Canary Cap Com. How do you feel?
This is Friendship Seven. I feel fine; no effects whatsoever, none.
Friendship Seven. Are you still seeing the particles around your capsule?
Negative. I don't seem to see them around here on this side. I saw a few, just a few just after I left Canaveral and turned around facing forward. They were coming toward me at that time. I was going, so I know that they were not coming from the capsule at all. I saw the particles in huge quantities at each sunrise so far. Over.
Say again, Friendship Seven.
The particles I saw were mainly at sunrise each time around. Over.
I understand. What control mode are you on?
This is Friendship Seven. I am in manual. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Friendship Seven, this is Canary Cap Com. The Aeromed wants to talk to you. Over.
Roger. Go ahead, Aeromed.
This is Canary surgeon. Are you having any nausea, or have you experienced any nausea at all during the entire flight?
This is Friendship Seven. Negative. I have felt perfectly normal during the whole flight. I feel fine. Over.
Very good. Back to Cap Com.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, do you want your inverter temperatures at this time?
Roger. This is Friendship Seven. Go ahead.
Roger. We're turning you over to Canary Systems.
Friendship Seven, this is Canary Systems. How do you read?
Go ahead, Canary Systems, go ahead.
The systems on the ground look fairly normal at this time. The temperatures are a little bit on the high side but there's nothing critical showing up. The latest reports show that the inverters are about 200 [degrees] and 210 [degrees]; this does not seem to be critical. They should be holding all this level. Do you understand?
Roger. Friendship Seven.
All other systems are as you reported to me.

Hello, Atlantic Ship. Friendship Seven. Over.
Friendship Seven, this is ATS Cap Com. Read only the last part of your transmission. Say again, please.
Atlantic Ship, This is Friendship Seven. Wish you would pass to Cape. I let the capsule drift around to the 180° position and I am having to reorient at present time. When Iain all lined with the horizon and the periscope, my attitude indications now are way off. My roll indicates 30° right; my yaw indicates 35 [degrees] right; and pitch indicates plus 40 [degrees]; I repeat plus 40 [degrees] when I am in orbit attitude. Over.
Did you receive?
Roger, Friendship Seven. I read you a little broken. You have discrepancies in attitudes of 30° right in roll, 35 [degrees] right in yaw and plus 40 [degrees] in pitch. Confirm, please. Over.
That is affirmative. I am realigning the capsule at present time and wilt cage and uncage the gyros before I go on the dark side. Over.
Roger. We will standby.
This is Friendship Seven, ATS. Do you receive?
Roger, Friendship Seven. Reading you loud and clear. Over.
This is Friendship Seven, in orbit attitude present time, caging gyros.

Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is Zanzibar Com Tech transmitting HF UHF. You're weak and garbled, weak and garbled. Do not copy. Over.
Roger. Friendship Seven. I receive you rather garbled, also. My condition is good. Fuel 5, correction, fuel 64-48 [percent]; oxygen 52-92 [percent]. Over.
(ATS) Friendship Seven, this is ATS Cap Com. I'm reading you very clear, very clear. Could you give me the reason for the errors in your attitudes, please?
This is Friendship Seven. That's a good question. I wish I knew, too. These errors have been off and on all during the flight. I have caged and recaged the gyros, caged and uncaged the gyros. I'm back in orbit attitude now but it is not, the attitude indicators are showing orbit attitude but it's not. By looking out at the horizon, I am about 20° right in roll and 20° too much on pitch down. I'm down to about probably 55° down in pitch by visual observation and about 20° right in roll. Yaw appears to be holding okay now. Over.
(ATS) Friendship Seven, ATS Cap Com.
Atlantic Ship, this is Friendship Seven. Over.
This is Friendship Seven, approaching sunset.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is Zanzibar Com Tech transmitting on HF UHF. Please acknowledge on HF. Over.
This is Friendship Seven recording. A lot of dirt on the windows from the retrofire and lot of stuff on here looks like, ah, we might have smashed some bugs even on the way up off the pad. Looks like blood on the outside of the window, maybe. It makes it real, very difficult to observe anything when they get around on the sun side.
Friendship Seven. The sun is going down again now. Coming off automatic in yaw, and yawing a little bit to the left to observe it.
Mark, the sun is down.
And can see little or nothing of zodiacal light at the moment.
This is Friendship Seven, flying with yaw handle pulled. Controlling on manual yaw.
The way the horizon looks is a very orange band. Just as the sun goes down and extends way off either side, probably 45° each side of the sun, comes up into a lighter yellow, then a very deep blue, then a very light blue, on up to the black of the sky.
Once again I can see lightning flashing under me, very clearly.

Hello, Zanzibar Com Tech. Friendship Seven on HF. Do you receive me now. Over.
Friendship Seven, this is Zanzibar Cap Com reading you weak but garbled.
Roger. Understand reading me weak and garbled.
This is Friendship Seven. I took the capsule off of automatic in yaw only to go left to look at the sunset. It's back on automatic at present time in all three axes; I'm backing it up with manual. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven, understand you're in automatic control in all three axes, backing up with manual. Is this affirmative. Over.
That is affirmative.
There's quite a big storm area under me. It must extend for, I see lightning flashes, as far, way off on the horizon to the right. I also have them almost directly under me here. They show up very brilliantly here on the dark side at night. They're just like firecrackers going off. Over.
Zanzibar, this is Friendship Seven. Did you get my fuels when I reported them? Over.
Repeat your last transmission. Over.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven. Fuel is 60-55 [percent], oxygen is 60-92 [percent], Amps are 22. Over.
This is Friendship Seven. All voltages are 25, or above. Over.
This is Friendship Seven at 3 plus 42. We should be just about over Johannesburg, I cannot see anything of southern Africa on this pass. Over.
Zanzibar Cap Com. Do you read? Over.
Roger, Zanzibar. I'm reading you weak but readable.
Zanzibar Cap Com, Friendship Seven on HF. Can see long streaky clouds down below as we, going off to my right up into sort of a general weather pattern. That's 3 plus 44.
This is Friendship Seven. An observation on control system operation: It appears that whenever I go off on manual, or fly-by-wire and maneuver for any lengthy period of time, that somehow we induce considerably, considerable errors into the gyro system. I come up with all kinds of attitudes. That time for instance, when I yawed around 180°, and held for a little while, and came back again, I had errors of 30° in roll, 35 [degrees] in yaw and plus 40 [degrees] in pitch.
This is Friendship Seven, going on manual pitch.
This is Friendship Seven. Several times I have felt that I had a partially stuck thruster or one that was just partly operating in pitch down and just then again I had a pitch up rate going and all at once I felt a down thrust and it pitched down on me. Again there, it repeated again that time, so I think I have a stuck pitch thruster occasionally.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is Indian Com Tech. How do you read? Over.

Roger. 04 plus 32 plus 38. I have correction, plus 37; I have 38 set on my retrosequence because of error in my clock of 1 second. Over.
That is affirmative. We assume you have an error in your clock. Over.
One second error, that is affirm. Request you confirm with Cape that I have 04 plus 32 plus 38 as correct retrograde time. Over.
Roger. That's affirmative.
This is Friendship Seven. The ASCS is drifting again. I'm indicating 25° right in yaw. Over.

Friendship Seven, this is Indian Cap Com. Surgeon would like to talk to you. Over.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven.
This is the surgeon here. Have you switched to secondary oxygen for any reason during this hop? Over.
Negative. I don't quite understand the decrease in secondary either unless it's the bottles are beginning to cool down, but they shouldn't cool that much.
We're reading 90 [percent] on the TM. How about you?
I am reading 90 [percent] also.
Somewhere about 65 [percent]. This is Indian Surgeon. Out.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven. This thing is slipping in and out of orientation mode and wasting fuel at present time. I'm just going to try and hold it on orbit attitude manually. Over. Or on fly-by-wire. Over.
Roger. Manually by fly-by-wire. Over.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. Checking different control modes on fly-by-wire. I have no low thrust to the right. Over.

Roger. This is Friendship Seven. 30-minute report: ASCS is major item, still not operating properly. I am on fly-by-wire at present time. I have no low thrust to the right fly-by-wire. Over.
Roger, understand no low right thruster on fly-by-wire.
That is affirmative. Got it?
We would like to send you a Z and R Cal sometime during your 30-minute report. ...
Roger. Fine.
You want to start down the 30-minute report there?
This is Friendship Seven. In 45 more seconds I would like to have you send a message for me, please. Over.
I want you to send a message to the Director, to the Commandant, U.S. Marine Corps, Washington. Tell him I have my 4 hours required flight time in for the month and request flight chit be established for me. Over.
Roger. Will do.
Think they'll pay it?
I don't know. Gonna find out.
Roger. Is this flying time or rocket time?
Lighter than air, buddy.
Rog.
We're sending you a Z and R Cal, hear.
Very well.
Coming now.
Are you going to start down on this procedure, or this 30-minute stuff?
Yes, all the fuse switches are still in the same position, Gordo. I haven't changed any of those. Squib is armed, Auto Retrojettison is off. I am on fly-by-wire, auto, and gyro normal. All "T" handles are in. The sequence panel is normal except for Landing Bag in the off position. The attitude indicator has been rather erratic, they drift very rapidly sometimes. Especially when I maneuver myself and then come back onto ASCS. It seems they have been thrown way off at that time.
Roger.
My retrograde time 04 plus 32 plus 38 for capsule time which corrects for I second error in this clock.
On that, MCC recommends you change that to 00:04:32:37 shortly after you get done with these others.
Roger. Okay, cabin pressure is still holding at 5.5. It's been there ever since we left. 90 [percent] on cabin temp, relative humidity is back up again now to about 36 [percent], coolant quantity is down a little bit too, we may have had a small water leak some place since we have that much increase in humidity, cause it was down around 20 [percent]. Our coolant quantity, though, is down around 62 [percent] now. The suit temperature is 70 [degrees] inlet; cabin suit pressure is 5.8. Steam temperature is 4 point, is 48 [degrees]. Oxygen is 60-90 [percent]. Amps are 24, ASCS is 11, about 115 now. Fan, is 110. Over.
Roger. All your switches outboard?
That's affirmative. On the right side, everything is outboard except the fuel quantity warning light which is on. I have that switch inboard to cut the audio.
The only 2 switch fuses in the center off position, on the right, are Retro Jettison and Retro Manual. Over.
Roger. Comfort control settings?
Control settings on the water?
Rog.
Water on, on cabin temperature is setting number 2. Setting on the suit temp is beyond the 1.7 mark. I repeat, beyond the 1.7 mark which is the maximum setting.
Roger. I understand. What is your opinion on the gyro problem, John?
Well, I don't know. I want to start lining up just as carefully as I can here in a minute and see whether the scanners will pick it up and correct it in so that we have a good retrofire attitude. If it is not, I'll aline it myself. Over.
Roger. Do you have your three Dog, Easy, and Hotel times from Indian Ocean Ship?
Yes I did. I got these okay.
And, now I gave you the recommended change in the retro clock to 00:04:32:37. On your retro, using ASCS, you'll be using high torque thrusters for retrofire mode there. What do you say about retroing by ASCS and backing up by fly-by-wire?
Well-well, you can't, you couldn't do it on ASCS and fly-by-wire. You mean on manual.
No, I meant you could go ASCS by fly-by-wire and back it up on manual proportional.
Yes. If the ASCS appears to be programing and holding a good orbit attitude I'll let it go on ASCS and back it up with manual. If not, if it appears that the gyros are cocked as they were a little while ago, then I'll just stay on manual retrofire, I think and let it go at that.
Are you in manual proportional or fly-by-wire now?
I'm in fly-by-wire now.
This is Friendship Seven. I am going to as near orbit attitude as I can establish here on the dark side.
Friendship Seven, Woomera Cap Com. We have contact UHF and TM solid.

This is Friendship Seven. I can notice a little crackling on fly-by-wire switches when I operate fly-by-wire; it comes in on the head set.
This is Friendship Seven. Turned around, yawed 180 [degrees] to see the sunrise here, and also to see these little, these little gadgets here that I don't know what they are.
They do not seem to be coming from the capsule at all. There are too many of them. They're all spread out all over the place; it looks like they're some of them might be miles away.

Friendship Seven, do you read on UHF? Over.
Roger, read UHF loud and clear.
Friendship Seven, Hawaii Cap Com. Reading you loud and clear on UHF.
Friendship Seven, we have been reading an indication on the ground of segment 51, which is Landing Bag Deploy. We suspect this is a erroneous signal. However, Cape would like, you to check this by putting the Landing Bag switch in auto position, and see if you get a light. Do you concur with this? Over.
Okay. If that's what they recommend, we'll go ahead and try it. Are you ready for it now?
Yes, when you're ready.
Roger. Negative, in automatic position did not get a light and I'm back in off position now. Over.
Roger, that's fine. In this case, we'll go ahead, and the reentry sequence will be normal.
Roger, reentry sequence will be normal.
Friendship Seven, have you completed your pre-retro check list?
This is Friendship Seven. Going to pre-re, check list at present time.
Roger. I'll standby.
Friendship Seven, Hawaii Cap Com.
Go ahead, Hawaii.
Have you completed pre-retro check list at this time?
That's affirmative. I'm just now completing it.
Roger. Can you comment again on this, the attitude system with respect to the, respect to the visual reference, how you feel about this at this time?
Well, it's into, it's in and out of orientation mode right now and is wasting fuel, in yaw. I may have to cut it in yaw, I don't know. It appears to be correcting, though, at the present time or maybe the scanners are correcting it okay now.
Roger, what mode are you in now?
I'm in ASCS, automatic.
Understand.
Did you understand the Cape would like you to change your clock by one second, to 00:04:32:37?
Negative. I'll change it right now.
Okay. Time is now 04 32 and 37.
We confirm with TM readout.
Roger.
Everything looks good on the ground. The inverter temperatures are a little high; 225° on the 150, 212° on the 250. Everything else looks pretty good.
Roger.
Surgeon would like to know ff you're still comfortable.
Roger, I'm in very good shape. I'll go through exercise bit in just a minute here, as soon as I get done with check list.
Okay, going through light test. Okay, checks okay.
Okay, 5 minutes to retrograde, light is on.

Don't do that, you want to go to the East Coast.
Roger. Fire retro light is green.
All three here.
Roger.
Roger, retros have stopped. A hundred. ...
Keep your retro pack on until you pass Texas.
That's affirmative.
Check.
Pretty good looking flight from what all we've seen.
Roger, everything went pretty good except for all this ASCS problem.
It looked like your attitude held pretty well. Did you have to back it up at all?
Oh, yes, quite a bit. Yeah, I had a lot of trouble with it.
Good enough for Government work from down here.
Yes, sir, it looks good, Wally. We'll see you back East.
Rog.
All right, boy.
Fire Retro is green.
Roger.
Jettison retro is red. I'm holding onto it.
Good head.
I'll tell you, there is no doubt about it when the retros fire.
Gathered that from your comments.
Everything is looking good, I'll give you a fast readout here. Fuel is 29-27 [percent]. The cabin pressure holding 5.5, cabin air is 88 [degrees], relative humidity is 33 [percent]; coolant quantity, 58 [percent], temperature is 71 [degrees], suit temperature is 71 [degrees], suit pressure is 5.8, steam temperature is 53 [degrees] in the suit, oxygen is, primary 60 [percent], 89 [percent] on secondary.
Looks pretty good on this end. How did the attitude seem to hold? Did you have any diversions in yaw at all?
Negative, very close. I backed it up and worked right along with the ASCS and it looked like it held right on the money.
Roger, we didn't notice any particular disparity here.
Roger, good. Do you have a time for going to Jettison Retro? Over.
Texas will give you that message. Over.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven, cutting yaw on automatic and I'll control that manually; it keeps banging in and out of orientation.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
Hello, Texas. Friendship Seven. Over.
Friendship Seven, Cal Cap Com. Do you read?
Roger.
Consideration about leaving retropack on, they will inform you over Texas.

Yes, sir.
Do you notice any contrast over the coastline, John?
Say again.

Roger, Texas, go ahead.
Roger. Reading you 5 square. Standby for Texas Cap Com.
Roger.
This is Texas Cap Com, Friendship Seven. We are recommending that you leave the retropackage on through the entire reentry. This means that you will have to override the 0.05g switch which is expected to occur at 00:04:43:53. This also means that you will have to manually retract the scope. Do you read?
This is Friendship Seven. What is the reason for this? Do you have any reason? Over.
Not at this time; this is the judgment of Cape Flight.
Roger. Say again your instructions please. Over.
We are recommending that the retropackage not, I say again, not be jettisoned. This means that you will have to override the 0.05g switch which is expected to occur at 00:04:43:53. This is approximately 4¼ minutes from now. This also means that you will have to retract the scope manually. Do you understand?
Roger, understand. I will have to make a manual 0.05g entry when it occurs, and bring the scope in manually. Is that affirm?
That is affirmative, Friendship Seven.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven, going to reentry attitude, then, in that case.
Friendship Seven, Cape flight will give you the reasons for this action when you are in view.
Roger. Roger. Friendship Seven.

Say again.
Standby.
This is Friendship Seven. Going to fly-by-wire. I'm down to about 15 percent on manual.
