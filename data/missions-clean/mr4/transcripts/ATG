Lift-off.
Loud and clear.
Loud and clear. José, don't cry too much.
Okey doke.
OK, it's a nice ride up to now.
Loud and clear.
Roger.
OK. The fuel is go; about 1 ½ g's; cabin pressure is just coming off the peg; the O2 is go; we have 26 amps.
Roger. Pitch 88, the trajectory is good.
Roger, looks good here.
OK, there. We're starting to pick up a little bit of the noise and vibration; not bad, though, at all. 50 secs., more vibration.
OK. The fuel is go; 1 ½ g's, cabin is 8, the O2 is go, 27 amps.
And ...
Pitch is ...
4, 5 ...
Pitch is 77; trajectory is go.
Roger. Cabin pressure is still about 6 and dropping slightly. Looks like she's going to hold at about 5.5.
Eh ...
Cabin ...
Believe me, O2 is go.
Cabin pressure holding 5.5.
Roger, roger.
This is Liberty Bell 7. Fuel is go, 2 ½ g's; cabin pressure 5.5; O2 is go; main 25, isolated – ah, isolated is 28. We are go.
Roger. Pitch is 62; trajectory is good.
Roger. It looks good in here.
Everything is good; cabin pressure is holding; suit pressure is OK; 2 minutes and we got 4 g's; fuel is go; ah, feel the hand controller move just a hair there; cabin pressure is holding; O2 is go; 25 amps.
Roger, we have go here.
And I see a star!
Stand by for cutoff.
There went the tower.
Roger, there went the tower, affirmative Chase.
Roger, squibs are off.
Roger.
There went posigrades, capsule has separated. We are at zero g and turning around and the sun is really bright.
Roger, capsep is green, turnaround started, manual handle out.
Oh boy! Manual handle is out; the sky is very, very black; the capsule is coming around into orbit attitude; the roll is a little bit slow.
Roger.
I haven't seen a booster anyplace. OK, rate command is coming on. I'm in orbit attitude, I'm pitching up. OK, 40 ... Wait, I've lost some roll here someplace.
Roger, rate command is coming on. You're trying manual pitch.
OK, I got roll back. OK, I'm at 24 in pitch.
Roger, your IP is right on, Gus, right on.
OK. I'm having a little trouble with rate, ah, with the manual control.
Roger.
If I can get her stabilized here, all axes are working all right.
Roger. Understand manual control is good.
Roger, it's – it's sort of sluggish, more than I expected.
OK, I'm yawing.
Roger, yaw.
Left, ah.
OK, coming back in yaw. I'm a little bit late there.
Roger. Reading you loud and clear, Gus.
Lot of stuff – there's a lot of stuff floating around up here.
OK, I'm going to skip the yaw, ah, or roll because I'm a little bit late and I'm going to try this rough yaw maneuver. About all I can really see is clouds. I haven't seen any land anyplace yet.
Roger, you're on the window. Are you trying a yaw maneuver?
I'm trying the yaw maneuver and I'm on the window. It's such a fascinating view out the window you just can't help but look out that way.
I understand.
You su-, ah, really. There I see the coast, I see.
4 plus 30 Gus.
4 plus 30, he's looking out the window. A-OK.
I can see the coast but I can't identify anything.
Roger, 4 plus 30 Gus.
OK, let me get back here to retro attitude, retro sequence has started.
Roger, retro sequence has started. Go to retro attitude.
Right, we'll see if I'm bad, not in very good shape here.
Got 15 seconds, plenty of time, I'll give you a mark at 00:00:05:10.
OK, retro attitude is still green.
Retros on my mark, 3, 2, 1, mark.
He's in limits.
OK, there's 1 firing, there's 1 firing.
Retro 1 (Cuts off Bell 7).
Roger, retro 1.
There's 2 firing, nice little boost. There went 3.
Roger, 3, all retros are fired.
Roger, roger.
OK, yeah, they're fired out right there.
Roger, retrojettison armed.
Retrojettison is armed, retrojettison is armed, going to rate command.
OK, I'm going to switch.
Roger, understand manual fuel handle is in.
Manual fuel handle is in, mark, going to HF.
Roger, HF.
Liberty Bell 7, this is Cap Com on HF, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. How do you read 7?
I got you.
...This is Cap Com on HF, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. How do you read 7?
... Here, do you read me, do you read me on HF? ... Going back to U ... Boy is that ... Retro, I'm back on UHF, and, ah, the jett ... the retros have jettisoned. Now I can see the Cape and, oh boy, that is some sight. I can't see too much.
Roger, I am on UHF high, do you read me?
Roger, reading you loud and clear on UHF high, can you confirm retrojettison?
OK, periscope is retracting, going to reentry attitude.
Roger. Retros are jettisoned, scope has retracted, you're going to reentry attitude.
Affirmative.
Bell 7 from Cap Com, your IP is right on.
Roger. I'm in reentry attitude.
Ah.
Roger, how does it look out the window now?
Ah, the sun is coming in and so all I can see really is just, ah, just darkness. The sky is very black.
Roger, you have some more time to look if you like.
7 from Cap Com, how do you feel up there?
I feel very good, auto fuel is 90, manual is 50.
Roger, 0.05 g in 10.
OK.
OK, everything is very good, ah.
I got 0.05 g and roll rate has started.
Roger.
Got a pitch rate in here, OK, g's are starting to build.
Roger, reading you loud and clear.
Roger, g's are building, we're up to 6.
There's 9.
There's about 10; the handle is out from under it; here I got a little pitch rate coming back down through 7.
Roger, still sound good.
OK, the altimeter is active at 65. There's 60.
Roger, 65,000.
Okay, I'm getting some contrails, evidently shock wave, 50,000 feet; I'm feeling good. I'm very good, everything is fine.
Roger, 50,000.
45,000, do you still read?
Affirmative. Still reading you. You sound good.
OK, 40,000 feet, do you read?
35,000 feet, if you read me.
30,000 feet, everything is good, everything is good.
Bell 7, this is Cap Com. How...
Cape, do you read?
25,000 feet.
Approaching drogue chute attitude.
There's the drogue chute. The periscope has extended.
This is...we have a green drogue here, 7 how do you read?
OK, we're coming down to 15,000 feet, if anyone reads. We're on emergency flow rate, can see out the periscope OK. The drogue chute is good.
Roger, understand drogue is good, the periscope is out.
There's 13,000 feet.
Roger.
There goes the main chute, it's reefed; main chute is good; main chute is good; rate of descent coming down, coming down to – there's 40 feet per second, 30 feet per, 32 feet per second on the main chute, and the landing bag is out green.
Ah, it's better than it was, Chuck.
Hello, does anybody read Liberty Bell, main chute is good, landing bag is on green.
And the landing bag is on green.

And I'm in the process of putting the pins back in the door at this time.
OK, I'm passing down through 6,000 feet, everything is good, ah.
I'm going to open my face plate.
Hello, I can't get one, I can't get one door pin back in. I've tried and tried and tried and I can't get it back in. And I'm coming, ATS, I'm passing through 5,000 feet and I don't think I have one of the door pins in.
Roger, Bell 7, roger.
Do you have any word from the recovery troops?
Liberty Bell 7, this is Card File 23, we are heading directly toward you.
ATS, this is Cap – this is Liberty Bell 7. Do you have any word from the recovery troops?
Negative, Bell 7, negative. Do you have any transmission to MCC? Over.
Ah, roger, you might make a note that there is one small hole in my chute. It looks like it's about 6 inches by 6 inches – it's sort of a – actually it's a triangular rip, I guess.
Ah, roger, roger.
I'm passing through 3,000 feet, and all the fuses are in flight condition; ASCS is normal, auto; we're on rate command; gyros are normal; auto retrojettison is armed; squibs are armed also. Four fuel handles are in; decompress and recompress are in; retro delay is normal; retrobeat is off; cabin lights are both. TM is on. Rescue aids is auto; landing bag is auto; retract scope is auto; retroattitude is auto. All the three, five pull strings are in. Going through some clouds to 2,000 feet. ATS, I'm at 2,000 feet; everything is normal.
Roger, Bell 7, what is your rate of descent again? Over.
The rate of descent is varying between 28 and 30 feet per second.
Ah, roger, roger, and once again verify your fuel has dumped. Over.
Seven ahead at bearing 020. Over.
OK. My max g was about 10.2; altimeter is 1,000; cabin pressure is coming towards 15.
We'll make up.
Temperature is 90.
We'll make up an eye rep.
Coolant quantity is 30; temperature is 68; pressure is 14; main O2 is 60; normal is, main is 60; emergency is 100; suit fan is normal; cabin fan is normal. We have 21 amps, and I'm getting ready for impact here.
Can see the water coming right on up.
Liberty Bell 7, Liberty Bell 7, this is Atlantic Cap Com, do you read me? Over.
OK, does anyone read Liberty Bell 7? Over.
Liberty Bell 7, Liberty Bell 7, Hunt Club 1 is 2 miles southwest you.
Liberty Bell 7, this 9 Card File. We have your entry into the water. Will be over you in just about 30 seconds.
Roger, my condition is good; OK, the capsule is floating, slowly coming vertical, have actuated the rescue aids. The reserve chute has jettisoned, in fact I can see it in the water, and the whip antenna should be up.
Hunt Club, did you copy?
OK, Hunt Club, this is...don't forget the antenna.
This is Hunt Club, say again.
Hunt Club, this is Liberty Bell 7. My antenna should be up.
This is Hunt Club 1...your antenna is erected.
Ah, roger.
OK, give me how much longer it'll be before you get here.
This is Hunt Club 1, we are in orbit now at this time, around the capsule.
Roger, give me about another 5 minutes here, to mark these switch positions here, before I give you a call to come in and hook on. Are you ready to come in and hook on anytime?
Hunt Club 1, roger we are ready anytime you are.
OK, give me about another 3 or 4 minutes here to take these switch positions, then I'll be ready for you.
1, wilco.
Hey Hunt Clubs, Card File, Card File 9, I'll stand by to escort you back as soon as you lift out. I keep another aircraft at least 2,000 feet.
Ah, Bell 7 this is Hunt Club 1.
Go, go ahead Hunt Club 1.
Roger, this is 1, observe something, possibly the canister in the water along side capsule. Will we be interfering with any TM if we come down and take a look at it?
Negative, not at all. I'm just going to put the rest of this stuff on tape and then I'll be ready for you, in just about 2 more minutes, I would say.
1 roger.
Liberty Bell 7, Cap Com at the Cape on a test count. Over.
Liberty Bell 7, Cape Cap Com on a test count. Over.
Any Hunt Club, this is 9 Card File.
Station calling Hunt Club, say again.
This is Niner Card File, there's an object on a line in the water, just about 160 degrees. The NASA people suspect it's the dye marker that didn't activate; ah, say it's about, ah, ¾ of a mile out from the capsule. Ah, after the lift out, will you take a check on it? Over.
Ah, this is Hunt Club 1, roger, we will have Hunt Club 3 check at this time, you copy 3.
Hunt Club 1, I believe he said ¾ of a mile?
This is 9 Card, that is affirmative.
OK, Hunt Club. This is Liberty Bell 7. Are you ready for the pickup?
This is Hunt Club 1; this is affirmative.
OK, latch on, then give me a call and I'll power down and b hatch, OK?
This is Hunt Club 1, roger, will give you a call when we're ready for you to blow.
Roger, I've unplugged my suit so I'm kinda warm now.
1, roger.
Now if you tell me to, ah, you're ready for me to blow, I'll have to take my helmet off, power down, and then blow the hatch.
1, roger, and when you blow the hatch, the collar will already be down there waiting for you, and we're turning base at this time.
Ah, roger.
