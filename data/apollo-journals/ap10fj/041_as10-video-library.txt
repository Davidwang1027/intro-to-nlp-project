Apollo 10 Sequence Photography (16-mm)
Apollo 10 returned 15 magazines of 16-mm cine photography using SO-368 colour film balanced for exterior lighting (CEX) and SO-168 colour film balanced for interior lighting (CIN). Eleven of the magazines contain plottable scenes of the lunar surface. Four magazines contain coverage of activity inside the spacecraft, the docking and the outside view during re-entry. Very good lunar surface detail was obtained from high and low angles, near vertical sequences as well as in many panoramic views. Most exposures were good except near subsolar when the rendition of scene was poor.

16-mm Data Acquisition Camera
The Data Acquisition Camera is a modified movie camera and is an improved version of the earlier Gemini-type 16-mm sequence camera equipped with new-type external film magazines which greatly enhance the photographic capabilities. Primary use of the camera is to obtain sequential photographic data during manned flights. It is used for documentary photography of crew activity within the CM and for recording scenes exterior to the spacecraft. Bracketry installations at each rendezvous window facilitate use of the camera for CSM-LM docking photography to recording engineering data. Camera modes of operation (frame rates) are variable as follows: time, 1 frame per second (fps), 6 fps, 12 fps, and 24 fps. Shutter speeds are independent of frame rate and include 1/60 second, 1/125 second, 1/250 second, 1/500 second and 1/1000 second. Camera power is obtained from the spacecraft electrical system via panel-mounted 28V DC utility receptacles. Camera operation is manually controlled by an On-Off switch located on the front of the camera. Camera weight, less film magazine, is 1.8 pounds (0.8 kg). When mounted at either spacecraft rendezvous window, the camera line-of-sight is parallel (+2 degrees) to the CM X-axis. Camera accessories include a power cable, film magazines, lenses, right angle mirror, and a ring sight, which are described in the following paragraphs. The remote control cable, can also be used with the 16-mm Data Acquisition Camera.
Power Cable. The power cable provides the necessary connection between the spacecraft electrical power system and the 16-mm camera. The cable is approximately 108 inches (2.74m) long and weighs approximately 0.23 pound (0.4kg). 28-Volt DC utility receptacles are located on spacecraft panels 15, 16, and 100.
16 mm Film Magazine. Film for each mission is supplied in preloaded film magazines that may be easily installed and/or removed from the camera by a gloved crew member. Film capacity is 130 feet (40 metres) of thin base film. Total weight of magazine with film is approximately one pound (0.4kg). Magazine run-time versus frame rate is from 87 minutes at one fps to 3.6 minutes at 24 fps. Each magazine has a film-remaining indicator plus an end-of-film red indicator light. Future plans include film magazines of 400-foot capacity. Quantity and type of film supplied is determined by mission requirements.
Lenses. Three lenses of different focal length are provided for use on the 16-mm camera.
10 mm. A medium wide-angle lens, the field of view being 41.1° x 54.9°. It is used for internal crew activities and equipment when details are required. Focus is from 6 inches to infinity with aperture openings from f/1.8 to 22. It has two spike-like handles for setting f-stop and distance with the gloved hands.
18 mm Kern. A lens of slightly wide-angle design and high optical quality. Primary use is for vehicle-to-vehicle photography while bracket-mounted at left or right rendezvous window. It is also the widest angle lens that may be used with the right-angle mirror. This lens is usually stowed on the camera. Viewing angle of 24 x 32° and weight is approximately 0.80 pound and has two spike-like handles for setting the f-stop and distance with the gloved hand. This improved lens has larger numbers for reading while in the EV spacesuit.
75 mm Kern. A medium telephoto lens design with excellent optical properties. Primary use is for photography of distant objects and ground terrain. Usually used on the window-mounted camera. Viewing angle of 6 x 8°, weight is approximately 0.80 pound. This lens is similar in appearance to the new 18-mm lens and has two handles for f-stop and distance, gloved hand settings, and larger printed numbers. It also has a sunshade.
Right Angle Mirror. This accessory, when attached to the bracket-mounted 16-mm camera and lens, facilitates photography through the spacecraft rendezvous windows along a line of sight parallel to the CM X-axis with a minimum of interference to the crewmen. It adapts to the 18-mm and 75-mm lenses by means of bayonet fittings.
Ring Sight. An accessory used on the 16-mm camera as an aiming aid when the camera is hand-held. The concentric light and dark circular rings, as seen superimposed on the view, aid the user in determining the angular field of view of the sight. It is attached to the camera by its shoe sliding into a C rail. It is also used on the 70-mm camera.
Data Acquisition Camera Mount. This device facilitates in-flight mounting of the 16-mm camera at the spacecraft's left or right rendezvous windows during zero g. The mount is a quick-disconnect hand-grip that may be attached to a dovetail adapter at either rendezvous window. The camera attaches to the mount by means of a sliding rail and a friction lock screwed against the camera by a knob. Two marked locating stops are provided for correct positioning of the camera at a window, one for the 18-mm lens and one for the 75-mm lens. Mount alignment is such that installed camera/lens line of sight is parallel to the CM X-axis, +1 degree.
16-mm Camera Sextant Adapter. The 16-mm camera can be used to take photographs of the Moon through the CM sextant during lunar orbit, using camera sextant adapter. The adapter is an optical unit about 20 cm long that mounts directly on the Guidance and Nav Panel 122 SXT socket. The camera attaches to the adapter by means of a bayonet fitting.
DAC Timing Cable. The DAC timing cable function is to supply 28V DC to the 16-mm DAC and route the shutter closure signal to the RHEB panel 227 and the PCM junction box. The DAC timing cable is 32 inches long with a connector at each end. The DAC connector has an orange index mark and is labeled P1 - DAC PWR. The connector for panel 227 is a large 90 elbow, has a blue grey index mark, and is labeled P2 - PNL 227. At launch, the cable is coiled, secured with a utility strap, and stowed in L2. After mounting the DAC in the right rendezvous window, the DAC timing cable is unstowed and the connector (P1 - DAC PWR) is mated to the camera. The SC1 INST PWR switch on panel 227 is verified in the Off position, the cable connector (P2) is connected to the panel receptacle, and the panel switch is placed to the PWR position. The shutter closure signal is sent to the PCM junction box when the camera is operating.
16-mm Camera Operation. The camera mount (grip) is removed from stowage and attached to the dovetail at the appropriate rendezvous window. The 16-mm camera and accessories are unstowed as required. The selected lens is attached. An optional right-angle mirror may be installed on the lens. A ring sight may also be installed on the camera for hand-held use. A film magazine is installed on camera. The correct exposure is determined. The lens aperture and focus are set. The camera mode (frame rate) and shutter speed are set. The power cable is installed on camera. If required, the camera is installed in the mount at the window. The Utility Power receptacle switch is set to Off, the camera power cable is connected to the appropriate receptacle and the Utility Switch is placed to the Power position. Filming operation can be started by pressing the Operate button (switch) on the front of the camera. To stop the camera, the Operate button is pressed again.
