This is Apollo Control. We don't expect any further conversation with the crew on the pass, In the event that we do hear anything, we'll come back up and play it back for you. At the present time Apollo 10 is about 48 minutes from Loss Of Signal, at the point at which it will be going behind the Moon on this the sixth revolution. And we're 87 hours, 22 seconds now into the mission. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 87 hours, 47 minutes. We're about 1 minute, 20 seconds now from LOS and it appears that all three crewmen are asleep at this time. We have about 5½ hours of sleep period left. At present time the spacecraft is in an orbit 61 nautical miles (113 km) by 59 nautical miles (109 km) and our velocity is about 5,343 feet per second (1,629 meters per second), or about 1 mile per second. We are now 30 seconds from Loss Of Signal as the spacecraft approaches the end of its sixth revolution. And after having observed all spacecraft systems on both the LM and the CSM, flight controllers here in Mission Control have concluded that everything is continuing to function normally. And we are now showing Loss Of Signal. We'll reacquire Apollo 10 in 46 minutes at which time we'll get another look at all the spacecraft systems. Continuing to monitor the performance of both Snoopy and Charlie Brown. At 87 hours, 49 minutes; this is Apollo Control.
Apollo 10 begins its seventh lunar orbit at about 088:05:00.
This is Apollo Control; 88 hours, 32 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 10. We're 1 minute, 50 seconds from reacquiring Apollo 10 as the spacecraft comes around the front of the Moon on its seventh revolution. We don't anticipate any communication with the crew. It appears that they are all asleep. At least that was the indication we had prior to losing signal from the spacecraft on the previous revolution. We will stand by for Acquisition Of Signal and we'll listen briefly, and in case we should get any call from the spacecraft. We're now 30 seconds from reacquiring Apollo 10 and here in Mission Control we're also in the midst of a change of shift. Flight Director Pete Frank and his Orange Team of flight controllers coming on to replace the Maroon Team headed by Flight Director Milton Windler. And we're still standing by for confirmation from the network controller that we do have acquisition of data from the spacecraft. And we've been advised by the network controller that we do have data from the spacecraft at this time. This is Apollo Control. It's now 5 minutes, 10 seconds into the front-side pass on this, the seventh revolution around the Moon. We'll have Loss Of Signal in 1 hour, 7 minutes approximately from now. And we'll continue to monitor spacecraft systems and stand by, should the crew awake and decide to put in a call to the control center here. We have about 4½ hours left in the present rest cycle. And all indications at this time are that the crew are all sleeping. A change of shift press briefing is scheduled. We expect that will occur in about 20 minutes at about 10 minutes to five Central Daylight Time. At 88 hours, 41 minutes; this is Apollo Control.
088:34:54 Young (onboard): This thing ain't going to be shut. You know?
088:35:00 Stafford (onboard): [Yawning] That was the finest sleep I could get. Have you got all that information? Oh, you don't?
This is Apollo Control; 89 hours, 47 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 10 spacecraft has just gone over the hill. The end - toward the end of the seventh lunar revolution. We have some 44 minutes, 15 seconds until Acquisition Of Signal again. Apollo 10 crew is still asleep. Lunar orbit measurements are 61.5 nautical mile (113.9 km) apogee, 58.7 nautical mile (108.7 km) perigee. As you were - those are apocynthion and pericynthion respectively to get into lunar terminology rather than Earth terminology. And it shows the next revolution Acquisition Of Signal at 92 hours, 32 minutes, 25 seconds. The Orange Team of flight controllers have settled in for tonight's activities. Coming up on manning of the Lunar Module, preparations for today's rendezvous sequence. And at 89 hours, 49 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
Apollo 10 begins its eighth lunar orbit at about 089:55:00
This is Apollo Control; 90 hours, 32 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We've just had Acquisition Of Signal as Apollo 10 came over the hill beginning the 8th revolution around the Moon. The crew has a little less than two hours remaining in the sleep period before beginning a very busy day; powering up, manning the Lunar Module and doing the complete rendezvous sequence which will include a sweep down within 8 nautical miles [15 km] of the lunar surface quite near Apollo landing site number 2. We have an hour and 11 minutes remaining in this revolution before Loss Of Signal. If the crew should waken and begin talking to the ground we'll come up again with the circuit. And at 90 hours, 33 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control; 91 hours, 44 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We've just had Loss Of Signal from Apollo 10 as it went over the hill on the 8th revolution - lunar revolution. The spacecraft systems are functioning extremely well. In fact, one of the shortest hourly reports on record has just come into the Control Center from the spacecraft analysis staff support room, about a half a page long. And most of the entries say systems performance normal. No change in status, and so on. As the spacecraft went over the hill, Commander - Apollo 10 Commander Tom Stafford had a heart rate of about 53, respiration rate 8; the Command Module Pilot John Young had a heart rate of 57, respiration 11; cabin pressure holding at 4.9 pounds per square inch; cabin temperature 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Centigrade); orbital weight now calculated at 68,144 pounds (30,910 kg). Apollo 10 is in a 58.4 by 61.7 nautical mile (108.2 x 114.3 km) lunar orbit. One hour and 25 minutes until alarm, wakeup alarm time. We'll have Acquisition Of Signal again at 92 hours, 30 minutes through Madrid, which is just less than an hour from now. At 91 hours, 46 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
Apollo 10 begins its seventh lunar orbit at about 091:50:00.
092:25:24 Young (onboard): [Garble]. Huh? [garble].
092:28:54 Cernan (onboard): Reacq mode's been working like a charm.
092:29:17 Cernan (onboard): Yes. Yes.
092:29:27 Young (onboard): [Garble].
092:29:57 Young (onboard): Do what? [Garble].
092:30:15 Young (onboard): [Garble].
092:30:28 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] Reacq? [Garble].
092:30:31 Young (onboard): Yes.
092:30:33 Cernan (onboard): [Garble].
This is Apollo Control; 92 hours, 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We've just had Acquisition Of Signal from Apollo 10 as it came around from the back side of the Moon on the 9th revolution. The nominal awake time is some 40 minutes away. However, if it appears the crew is awake at the present time, we'll begin the day's activities. The flight surgeon will sample the incoming biomedical data to try to determine whether they indeed are awake. From heart rate, respiration and so on, he can tell pretty well what a man's status is. No call from the crew yet. After the crew has awakened, their first job of course will be to have breakfast, report their crew status on sleep to the ground here in Mission Control Center, get a Flight Plan update on the day's activities, and prepare to repressurize the Lunar Module and the Lunar Module Pilot will be the first man across into the LM through the tunnel, at about 94 hours, 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, followed some 10 minutes later with the commander going over; Tom Stafford. Heart rates and respiration rates are up slightly above what they were at LOS on the - or Loss Of Signal - at the 8th revolution. Still awaiting word from the surgeon as to whether the men are awake or not. Surgeon reported to the Flight Director Pete Frank here, that it appears that the crew is still in light sleep; Flight Director said, "We'll leave them alone for a while." Next Loss Of Signal as the spacecraft goes around the back side of the Moon again on this revolution will be some 1 hours, 8 minutes from now. Still no conversation with the spacecraft; we'll come back up when the communications do start for the day's activities, and at 92 hours, 35 minutes, Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control; 92 hours, 51 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We are anticipating a wake-up call to the crew of Apollo 10, which will be in the form of music again, apparently. Standing by for music to go up to the crew; pleasant way to start the day.
092:51:44 Lousma: ("The Best Is Yet to Come" played here.)
092:52:34 Lousma: Apollo 10, Houston. Reveille Reveille!
092:52:43 Stafford: Roger. Understand reveille. I didn't think that sounded like the Marine Corps Hymn there, the music that was coming up. But it did sound pretty good.
092:52:56 Lousma: Roger, 10. We copy. Go ahead and have your breakfast, and we're ready to go when you are.
Comm break.
092:55:08 Stafford: We're a bit ahead of schedule. We've already had breakfast and gone through the redundant component check.

092:55:14 Lousma: Roger. We have a consumables update and Flight Plan update when you are ready.
092:55:23 Stafford: Go ahead.
092:55:26 Lousma: Roger. Your consumables update valid at 93 hours; your RCS total was 77 per cent: quad A, 75 per cent; quad B, 81 per cent; quad C, 77 per cent; D, 81 per cent...
The geometrically opposite SM RCS quadrants are displaying a good propellant balance, indicating good performance and propellant management.
092:55:46 Cernan: Go ahead, Houston, with the consumable and Flight Plan update, Jack.
092:55:55 Lousma: Apollo 10, Houston. How do you read?
092:56:01 Lousma: Apollo 10, Apollo 10. Houston. Over.
092:56:07 Young: We read you loud - We read you loud and clear, Jack.
092:56:13 Lousma: Apollo 10, Apollo 10, Houston. Your consumables...
092:56:15 Stafford: We read you loud and clear.
092:56:16 Lousma: ...update follows. Valid at 93 hours: RCS total, 77 per cent; quad A, 70 - 75 per cent; quad B, 81 per cent; quad Charlie, 77 per cent; quad Delta, 81 per cent. That's 8 per cent ahead of your Flight Plan. Your H2 totals 34.5 pounds, O2 totals 435 pounds. Over.
092:56:57 Young: Roger. We got it.
092:57:02 Lousma: Roger, 10. I have a Flight Plan update when you are ready.
092:57:13 Young: Okay. Go ahead with it. Over
092:57:16 Lousma: Okay. At the end of your postsleep checklist, add these items. At 93 plus 45, terminate battery B charge. At 93:50, dump waste water to 36 per cent. I repeat, to 36 per cent. All lunar orbit activities are about 12 minutes later than the Flight Plan. I have your nominal burn times, if you want them.
They are 12 minutes behind the Flight Plan timeline due to the slightly extended Trans Lunar Coast (TLC) duration.
092:58:03 Young: No. We'll get that later, Jack, thank you.
092:58:07 Lousma: Houston. Roger.
092:58:13 Young: Okay. That was terminate battery B charge on waking up and dump the waste water to 36 per cent.
092:58:23 Lousma: Roger, 10. That's affirmative.
092:58:34 Young: Is that all the update? Over.
092:58:38 Lousma: Roger, 10. That's the end of the update.
092:58:45 Young: Okay. Thank you.
092:58:56 Cernan: Good morning, smiling Jack.
092:58:58 Lousma: Good morning. You boys have been up a while, I see.
092:59:06 Cernan: Yes. We tried to sneak up on it just by - just about a half hour or so. Or more.
092:59:12 Lousma: Roger, 10. I know you're busy. If you have some time to listen sometime when you are interested, I have the local newspaper, again.
092:59:25 Cernan: Go ahead. We would like to listen to it.
092:59:32 Lousma: Okay. One kind of interesting thing was John's horoscope this morning; says, "Everybody you know has something helpful to offer. Listen carefully while you make the rounds quickly. Put in a busy day and assemble your results in the evening." Now here goes the news. Springfield, Massachusetts: students at Springfield Technical College told President Edmund T. Garvey they were taking over the Administration Building. Garvey was nonplussed. The students, about 40 in number, marched into the building Wednesday night armed with mops, brooms, scrub brushes, and staged a "clean-in." They said they would clean all night. A student spokesman said the clean-in at the 1,200-member campus was to support the administrative policies of the 2-year-old school. Safi, Morocco: on Friday, Thor Heyerdahl will set out from here to cross the Atlantic in a papyrus boat. The man who must keep his papyrus boat together with rope and string bought his third wife this year, and is now complaining about the price. She cost about 60 dollars in Egypt, much more than the going rate in Chad, where Abu Debrine learned how to make papyrus boats and hitched onto Heyerdahl's expedition. If he succeeds in reaching Mexico in his boat, modeled after a 4,700-year-old Egyptian craft, Heyerdahl will consider he has strengthened the argument that the great early civilization of the Americas learned from the Pharaohs. Debrine is packing pictures of wives A and B, smiling side by side, into his kit for the reed boat trip. A photo of wife C, who has less seniority but is more expensive, gets a less prominent place. Good grief, Charlie Brown. Paris: Allied negotiators headed into the Vietnam talks today with what sources close to the meeting said were optimistic that discussions of proposals by President Nixon and the Viet Cong could bring progress. U.S. delegation sources said Henry Cabot Lodge, Chief U.S. negotiator, would comment, on the Viet Cong's 10-point peace plan Washington said included some points meriting further study. The chief North Vietnamese negotiator indicated he and his Viet Cong counterpart were still studying the Nixon eight-point proposal. Washington: Warren E. Burger, an Appeals Court judge with a reputation for being strong on law and order, was picked Wednesday by President Nixon to be Chief Justice of the United States. Burger, 61, a member of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington since he was appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956, is known as a strict constructionist, the type of judge Nixon promised to elevate to the court during his campaign, last fall. Plymouth, England: solo around the world sailor, Nigel Tetley, was pulled from the Atlantic by a tanker crew today when his boat sank 14 days from home. Tetley's wife, on hearing the news, said, "It is our home that is gone. All my pots and pans have gone to the bottom of the sea." Tetley was competing in a global race sponsored by a London newspaper. Moscow: Moscow TV showed the Apollo 10 astronauts in a 1-minute broadcast. It said it was live from the American space capsule. And do you remember that unemployed local philosopher? He now says that while he believes in the future of color television, he thinks that because of your flight, it will go round and round in people's minds for a while yet. Here is a sports story: Houston 3, Montreal 2, and Houston has just climbed out of the cellar. New York 5, Atlanta 0; Chicago at Los Angeles, a night game; just heard from the back room that Los Angeles beat Chicago. Over.
093:03:46 Cernan: Boo!
Comm break.
093:06:10 Lousma: Apollo 10, Houston. We've got a couple of items here we'd like your help on. We have a temperature rise in the helium tank in quad Alpha, so what we'd like you to do after LOS, we'd like you to roll 180 degrees and then come back to the normal attitude at AOS for S-band acquisition. In addition, we'd like your crew status report, and we'd like you to include some information on the cabin environment during the night to see if there is any change in it since the evaporators were not on the line. Over.
093:06:57 Cernan: Yes. It was fine. Its normally chilly self. We didn't need to turn off all that stuff.
093:07:09 Lousma: 10, Roger. [Long pause.]
093:07:31 Young: Okay. Could we have an update on when you expect LOS? Over.
093:07:38 Lousma: Okay, 10. LOS is going to be at 93:42, and AOS will be at 94:29. Over.
093:08:04 Young: Roger. 93:42 and 94:29. [Long pause.]
093:08:20 Young: Okay, Jack. On that roll, do you want a roll to 180 degrees, or roll a Delta angle of 180 degrees?
093:08:29 Lousma: 10, we want you to roll a Delta angle of 180 degrees.
Young's question is whether MCC-H want a change (Delta) of 180 degrees in roll or a manoeuvre to the 180 degrees position in roll. This attitude change is to put SM RCS quadrant Alpha into the shade to reduce it's temperature whilst the spacecraft is out of contact behind the Moon, returning to the nominal attitude just prior to AOS so that they are in the right attitude for immediate reacquisition via the S-band antenna.
093:08:38 Young: Okay. That's what I figured; just trying to clarify it, though.
093:08:41 Lousma: Roger, 10.
Comm break.
093:10:26 Cernan: Jack, the ECS redundant component check is complete, and it looks good from here.
093:10:32 Lousma: Roger, 10. We copy.
093:10:55 Cernan: Jack, crew status report: We all had about six pretty good hours of sleep. We've eaten breakfast this morning, and the readings on the dosimeters are, in order, 26037, 05307, 15039.
093:11:19 Lousma: Okay, Gene. Copy 6 hours sleep and 26037, 05307, 15039. Thank you.
093:11:30 Cernan: The cryo fans have been cycled, redundant component check is complete. I'm about ready to purge the H2 here in about 5 minutes, and then we'll get the battery and the water dump here before too long. I might take the batteries off the line, that charge off the line, maybe 10 - 15 minutes early, if it's compatible with our suiting up and everything.
093:11:56 Lousma: Roger. We copy. And the battery action is all right by us.
093:12:04 Cernan: Okay.
Long comm break.
093:15:48 Lousma: Apollo 10, Houston. We'd like you to cycle the heaters on the hydrogen cryo tanks; number 1, Off; number 2, Auto. Over.
093:16:00 Cernan: 1, Off and 2, Auto, Jack.
093:16:03 Lousma: Roger. Thank you.
093:16:05 Cernan: And I'm ready to purge the fuel cells. I'll start with fuel cell 3, oxygen then hydrogen.
093:16:14 Lousma: Roger. We copy. We're standing by.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. Apparently the crew is busy at the present time doing some housekeeping chores, washing the breakfast dishes, and so on. The wakeup call which turned out not to be a wakeup at all because the crew had already been awake and had had breakfast, was playing up to the crew Tony Bennett's record of "The Best Is Yet To Come." The crew reported they all had 6 hours of good solid sleep. They gave their radiation dosimeter readings on all three crewmen, and from the ground they were given Flight Plan updates of a few changes in the Flight Plan, moving a few operations around slightly. We're still 23 minutes away from Loss Of Signal on this the 9th revolution around the Moon. We'll continue to monitor the air-to-ground and leave the circuit live until we do have Loss Of Signal. Ground Elapsed Time is now 93 hours, 19 minutes. Acquisition Of Signal, the next revolution, 10th revolution, will be at 94 hours, 28 minutes, 50 seconds. The crew has not as yet been passed up the new times for the maneuver sequence, all the maneuvers that have to go into the rendezvous such as the Descent Orbit Insertion, the phasing, coelliptic sequence, constant delta height, etc. These likely will be read up to them during the next revolution. Apollo Control standing by on air-ground for resumption of communications with Apollo 10.
093:23:07 Lousma: Apollo 10, Houston. I have a map update for rev 10 if you want it.
093:23:16 Cernan: Hold it just a minute, Jack.
Long comm break.
093:27:48 Cernan: Hello, Houston. This is 10. Are you reading us?
093:27:50 Lousma: That's affirm. Loud and clear.
093:27:55 Cernan: Okay, fine. [Long pause.]
093:28:45 Cernan: Houston, the fuel cell purge is complete, the H2 purge line heater is Off, and I'd like to go ahead and terminate battery B charging at the time.
The purge line which carries H2 to the fuel to purge them has an in-line heater. Just prior to a fuel cell purge the heater is switched. The cryogenic temperature of the H2 could cause the water by-product to freeze in this line if it was not heated. The fuel cell itself creates sufficient heat from the power generation reaction to avoid the cells themselves freezing.
093:28:55 Lousma: Roger. We copy. Stand by one on the batt. Apollo 10, Houston. You are clear to terminate battery charge.
Termination of the routine charging of the CSM entry battery B.
093:29:07 Cernan: Okay. Thank you, Jack.
Long comm break.
093:32:46 Lousma: Apollo 10, Houston. We'd like you to verify that all the fans are off in the cryo tanks. Over.
093:33:07 Cernan: Negative, Jack. I had them cycling. Thank you. I'll turn them off at this time.
093:33:12 Lousma: Houston. Roger.
093:33:18 Cernan: I got too many meters running, I guess, right now.
093:33:26 Lousma: Take your time, but hurry.
093:33:46 Cernan: Jack, give me another hack on when LOS is, would you, and AOS?
093:33:51 Lousma: All right. LOS is at 93:42. AOS is at 94:29. And I have your map updates for 10 and 11 when you're ready.
093:34:46 Cernan: Okay, Jack. Go ahead.
093:34:48 Lousma: Okay. Map update, rev 10: 093:42:40, 093:54:35, 094:28:50; sunrise 093:52:22, sunset 095:04:46. Rev 11: 095:41:06, 095:52:52, 096:27:16, sunrise 095:50:58, sunset 097:03:22. Over.
The map update times are given for each revolution and are hand written on the Flight Plan. The times given for Rev 10 are LOS, 93:42:40; sunrise, 93:52:22; crossing 150°W, 93:54:35; AOS, 94:28:50; sunset, 95:04:06. For Rev 11 are LOS, 95:41:06; sunrise, 95:50:58; crossing 150°W, 95:52:52; AOS, 96:27:16; sunset, 97:03:22.
Flight Plan page 3-53a - Map Update.
093:35:58 Cernan: Okay, Jack I got all those and good, I don't - I don't need to read them back.
093:36:04 Lousma: Houston. Roger.
093:36:13 Cernan: I think we're in pretty good shape except for the waste-water dump which we've got yet to go right now.
093:36:18 Lousma: Roger. We copy. And you're dumping to 36 per cent.
093:36:26 Cernan: Okay. We'll dump to 36.
093:36:53 Cernan: Houston, we're starting the waste-water dump now.
093:36:56 Lousma: Roger, 10. We copy. [Long pause.]
093:37:52 Lousma: Apollo 10. Houston. We wanted to remind you to actuate your GDC, optics power and potable water. Over.
093:38:10 Cernan: Okay. Optics power coming on right now and potable water, GDC On.
Long comm break.
The G&N Optics Power switch on panel 100 has two positions. In the On position supplies DC operating power to the optics subsystem via the Power and Servo Assembly (PSA) on both main buses.
The Att Set switch on panel 1 is set to GDC (Gyro Display Coupler) prior to GDC alignment.
The Pot H2O Htr on panel 2, is switched off as part of the pre-sleep procedure. No as part of the post sleep procedures the heater is turned back on again. It provides 28 VDC to the potable water tank heater via the selected main bus. The heater is required to warm the water being provided as a bi-product of the reaction in the fuel cells.
Potable H2O Heater - Panel 2.
093:41:42 Young (onboard): [Garble] stand up [garble].
093:41:46 Stafford (onboard): You know [garble] see?
093:41:56 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] see it coming down through the...
093:41:57 Unidentified speaker (onboard): Yes.
093:41:58 Stafford (onboard): Got it?
093:42:17 Lousma: Apollo 10, Houston. We're going to lose you around the corner. We'll pick you up in about 46 minutes.
This is Apollo Control, 1 minute to Loss Of Signal as Apollo 10 goes around behind the Moon in the 9th revolution.
093:42:25 Cernan: Okay. To give you a status, we've got two guys - one suited - John's getting suited. I'm on my way to the LM here as soon as we complete the waste-water dump.
093:42:33 Lousma: Roger.
093:42:34 Stafford (onboard): Oh, Just a minute, John. [Garble]. Let's see; who's got...
093:42:38 Cernan (onboard): [Garble].
093:42:51 Stafford (onboard): [Garble].
093:42:52 Cernan (onboard): [Garble].
093:42:53 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] today with the suit off. Feels good...
093:42:55 Young (onboard): Okay.
093:42:58 Stafford (onboard): ...[garble]. I've got my helmet bags, and I'm all suited and ready to go. [Garble] watch that while you [garble].
This is Apollo Control. We have had Loss Of Signal with Apollo 10. The crewmen who will go aboard the LM, the Commander and the Lunar Module Pilot, are now preparing to repressurize the LM, go in through the tunnel, power up all the LM systems, complete the checkout, and prepare for the day's activities which will be about an 8-hour sequence of several maneuvers in lunar orbit to simulate everything but an actual landing, the lunar landing mission that will be carried out on Apollo 11. Some 44 minutes to acquisition of Apollo 10 on the next revolution. That will be at 94 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. And at 93 hours, 44 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
093:43:08 Cernan: Yes.
Very long comm break.
093:43:09 Stafford (onboard): You what?
093:43:12 Cernan (onboard): I can file these things out of the way, that we don't need. He's got, the Flight Plan. Now we got... [Garble].
093:43:24 Stafford (onboard): OK. Let me have them here, Gene-o; and you can...
093:43:37 Stafford (onboard): [Garble]. How about giving me my - You going to take that whole checklist over there? Just leave me the activation; that's all I need.
093:44:57 Stafford (onboard): OK, babe. I'll be following you on the schedule.
093:45:07 Stafford (onboard): What? I put it down where it was supposed to be, on that bag.
093:45:28 Stafford (onboard): Hey, turn off the waste-water pump; turn off the vent, John. Huh?
093:45:43 Stafford (onboard): What's there? OK.
093:46:59 Stafford (onboard): What, John? Yes. Yes, we did [garble] he did? I thought he terminated! Okay. I'll go to SPS [garble].
093:48:14 Stafford (onboard): From 135 [garble].
093:48:18 Cernan (onboard): I can't get [garble].
093:48:22 Stafford (onboard): [Laughter.] 135 to 215 [garble].
093:48:45 Stafford (onboard): I'm going to put my toothbrush down here. Did I - I put it over here, John? [Garble]?
093:48:51 Young (onboard): [Garble].
093:49:44 Stafford (onboard): Coming up on 93:50 in 15 seconds. You want to check the event timer? I'll give you a hack in 9 second; at 93:50. Okay.
Apollo 10 begins its tenth lunar orbit at about 093:50:00
093:50:09 Stafford (onboard): Okay. Stand by. I'll get this.
093:50:13 Young (onboard): Ready for LM Power. Stand by. Go.
093:50:20 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] on LM Power.
The source of electrical power is now transferred entirely to the LM batteries. Up to this point, the CSM has provided an alternative source for the LM systems.
093:50:36 Stafford (onboard): [Garble]. Oh, boy.
093:50:53 Stafford (onboard): You want these interconnects on Gene's hose? No. You're on the [garble] Now, get this out of the ways and put an interconnect on it. Are the interconnects down in the bag, there?
093:51:24 Stafford (onboard): Okay. You [garble]? You want to roll to 3 - 3 fif[teen] - 315. What'd you do John?
093:52:24 Stafford (onboard): Okay, here's the [garble], John. You can put that on that [Garble]. Right here.
093:53:20 Stafford (onboard): Okay, Gene-o's [garble] hose for interconnection.
093:53:44 Stafford (onboard): Where do you want to put these, John? You can stick that [garble] You need one more connection, [garble] for Gene-o (cough).
093:54:20 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] 315. Yes. Hey, you stopped at 330. I'll give you one more chance, babe. OK, let us know [garble] roll the [garble]? I think we're configured, babe. I'll get out this activation. Yes, we're running a good 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Huh? OK, well we'll try to stay way ahead of schedule, and that'll give you time, huh?
Stafford is commenting on the current roll attitude that Young has stopped at. It is at 330 degrees instead of the prescribed 315 degrees.
093:55:31 Stafford (onboard): Oh, shit. Boy, this quad A did get hotter than a son of a bitch. 400; B is 375; C is 350 - 350 - psi - No, wait; [garble] the psi is right up there around 5,000. It's up there around 5,000, I know.
Stafford is commenting on the SM RCS Helium tank supply pressure and temperature. It is displayed on a meter on panel 2.
RCS Indicator selection switch and Temperature/Press meter - Panel 2.
093:56:09 Stafford (onboard): Oh, shit. It's over 400 degrees. No wonder they [garble]. I wonder if [garble] made.
093:56:24 Stafford (onboard): What - what'd you say, Gene-o? What? OK, coming up on 93:56. I'll give you one at 93:57; OK? You've got 20 seconds to go.
093:56:53 Stafford (onboard): 4 seconds - 93:57. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
093:57:02 Stafford (onboard): Mark.
093:57:04 Stafford (onboard): 93:57- You get it? The what? Okay; 17, 18, 19, 20. The what? Okay, 93:58. Yes. Okay. Okay; you've got 20 seconds to go to 58. Yes, I'll connect you [garble].
093:57:53 Stafford (onboard): 10 seconds. 4, 3, 2, 1...
093:58:02 Stafford (onboard): Mark it.
093:58:05 Stafford (onboard): 4 - 3, 4, 5, 6. Fixed? Okay? You've got LM power all squared away yet, babe? Get into the LM (cough), José. AOS, babe. AOS. I'm going to disconnect these LM power cables, Gene-o. Okay? Get it AOS. Okay, LM power is coming disconnected.
093:59:50 Stafford (onboard): Okay. Yes. Didn't you hear me? You did? Huh? Which one do I...
094:00:06 Young (onboard): Oh, okay. I see what the problem - Excuse me.
094:00:08 Stafford (onboard): Okay, let's get these stowed; these are good souvenirs.
094:00:12 Young (onboard): Okay. Put those up, huh?
094:00:16 Stafford (onboard): That's both of them, babe.
094:00:19 Young (onboard): I'll put them in the temporary stowage bag. That's a safe place.
094:00:22 Stafford (onboard): Yes, that's fine.
094:00:52 Stafford (onboard): OK. Just keep busting on ahead, babe. Shit. I'm getting this thing cleaned up up here.
094:01:09 Stafford (onboard): John?
094:01:10 Young (onboard): Yes?
094:01:11 Stafford (onboard): You got a wet rag, babe? And I'll clean up this deal on the LM, in case...
094:01:17 Young (onboard): I know I saw me a wet rag down there somewhere, but I sure haven't got one, I tell you.
094:01:22 Stafford (onboard): I have one in my - (Cough)...
094:01:39 Young (onboard): I'm just freaking helpless.
094:01:40 Stafford (onboard): You got your suit on?
094:01:57 Stafford (onboard): Are we supposed to reverse suit hoses here, to get cooler? Yes.
094:02:02 Young (onboard): Yes.
094:02:46 Stafford (onboard): Oh, where did you put our - I've got a towel in my - trouser pocket of a...
094:03:02 Young (onboard): Well, let's go.
094:03:04 Stafford (onboard): That's the TV camera you're banging all over the place.
094:03:07 Young (onboard): Well, shit. What a mess!
094:03:12 Stafford (onboard): (Cough) It is pretty bad, isn't it?
094:03:15 Young (onboard): Guarantee it is. I put them down in there. Remember [garble]?
094:03:21 Stafford (onboard): Where?
094:03:22 Young (onboard): My [garble].
094:03:23 Stafford (onboard): Yes. Where, John?
094:03:25 Young (onboard): Back in hack, there.
094:03:26 Stafford (onboard): In the [garble]?
094:03:27 Young (onboard): Yes.
094:03:37 Stafford (onboard): Get through?
094:03:40 Young (onboard): I think [garble] done [garble].
094:03:59 Stafford (onboard): Good shape.
094:04:38 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] hard to beat, John.
094:04:40 Young (onboard): That's right. You get the [garble] through a [garble].
094:04:49 Stafford (onboard): You know it.
094:04:51 Young (onboard): [Garble].
094:04:56 Stafford (onboard): You want to put that stuff back there?
094:04:58 Young (onboard): Yes, [garble].
094:05:53 Young (onboard): Okay. How much [garble]? Alright. Put these things up here. [Garble].
094:06:10 Stafford (onboard): Okay. I think you've got to go up to the...
094:06:42 Young (onboard): What the hell is that?
094:06:44 Stafford (onboard): That's Gene-o's S-band,
094:06:46 Young (onboard): Wow; poor Gene-o. That's all I get to say.
094:06:51 Stafford (onboard): Shit. I don't know if there is a way we can get that thing good and clean. I wiped it off.
094:06:56 Young (onboard): Got a lot of Mylar down in here.
094:07:04 Stafford (onboard): OK, I'll get up there [garble]. I'll just take this thing in with me.
094:07:12 Young (onboard): Say; you have my gloves, babe.
094:07:14 Stafford (onboard): Yes. Thank you.
094:07:22 Young (onboard): Check and make sure your two gloves are mates.
094:07:24 Stafford (onboard): Yes. How about you, babe?
094:07:29 Young (onboard): OK. I thought maybe [garble].
094:07:31 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] pick the whole [garble] if you want to. [Garble].
094:07:43 Stafford (onboard): Hey, Gene-o. How about knocking my helmet bag down here to ECS? It might [garble] my hoses, [garble] the whole thing right there. [Garble].
094:08:12 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] you, too. How's; that quad [garble]?
094:08:19 Young (onboard): [Garble] your temperatures.
094:08:26 Stafford (onboard): Temperature is over 400. Look at the pressure in the other one.
Stafford is again commenting on the SM RCS Helium tank supply pressure and temperature.
094:08:33 Young (onboard): [Garble] damn fool [garble] there. [Garble].
094:08:37 Stafford (onboard): See, D is up; A, B, C, D. About 400 degrees.
094:09:07 Stafford (onboard): Had a barbecue there last night.
094:09:06 Young (onboard): Why the freak didn't they say something about it last night? That's stupid.
094:09:12 Stafford (onboard): Maybe they'll cool down now.
094:09:16 Young (onboard): I don't know if they will or not. A is right there.
094:09:23 Stafford (onboard): Yes, if you stay 180 degrees or more away.
094:09:27 Young (onboard): Babe, that ain't why it got hot.
094:09:55 Young (onboard): Flipped quads A and B and didn't flip quad A.
094:10:04 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] C and D quads?
094:10:14 Stafford (onboard): That's what you're worried about [garble].
094:10:18 Young (onboard): Come on, Tom.
094:10:24 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] little while yet. It's still [garble] on there [garble].
094:10:41 Young (onboard): Hang on, Tom. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, Tom.
094:10:45 Stafford (onboard): What's the matter, babe?
094:10:46 Young (onboard): You've got my [garble].
094:10:48 Stafford (onboard): Oh. You want some chewing gum, John?
094:10:51 Young (onboard): No thanks.
094:10:52 Stafford (onboard): Huh? You don't?
094:10:54 Young (onboard): No. OK.
094:11:09 Stafford (onboard): I'll put two or three water bags in this temporary stowage bag [garble].
094:11:16 Young (onboard): OK, you can go ahead and go into the LM and activate the ECS, if you want to.
094:11:21 Stafford (onboard): I've got to wait.
094:11:24 Young (onboard): For what?
094:11:31 Stafford (onboard): Well...
094:11:41 Young (onboard): What do I do to turn it off?
094:12:00 Stafford (onboard): Okay, John. Babe is the only thing you have to do...
094:12:04 Young (onboard): Yes.
094:12:06 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] the LM stuff and [garble]...
094:12:09 Young (onboard): Yes?
094:12:11 Stafford (onboard): ...and [garble] the TV.
094:12:13 Young (onboard): Okay.
094:12:14 Stafford (onboard): The monitor will come on for you, [garble].
094:12:19 Young (onboard): That's alright. That's just the way it was. That's fine.
094:12:22 Stafford (onboard): Okay. Some [garble].
094:12:25 Young (onboard): Okay.
094:12:27 Stafford (onboard): That's all you got, to do. And, you've got it on the wide zoomer?
094:12:33 Young (onboard): Yes.
094:12:34 Stafford (onboard): Okay. So there's a big field of view in the little glass here. Are you focused with your zoom?
094:12:41 Young (onboard): Why don't we take the top - why don't we take the thing off and run a little? Get the monitor adjusted [garble].
094:12:47 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] see it operate. [Garble].
094:13:02 Young (onboard): [Garble].
094:13:10 Stafford (onboard): Yes.
094:13:11 Young (onboard): [Garble].
094:13:12 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] TV? [Garble] to use just the [garble].
094:13:27 Stafford (onboard): What you looking at?
094:13:29 Young (onboard): Looking at the window. I'm looking at the Earth.
094:13:31 Stafford (onboard): Looking at the window, or my head? My head bothering you?
094:13:34 Young (onboard): No that's great.
094:13:36 Stafford (onboard): What is?
094:13:37 Young (onboard): Looking at the window of the LM.
094:13:38 Stafford (onboard): Okay.
094:13:41 Young (onboard): Good picture.
094:13:42 Stafford (onboard): Beautiful.
094:13:45 Young (onboard): [Garble].
094:13:49 Stafford (onboard): Okay, TV off. How'd it come out, (cough) [garble]?
094:13:55 Young (onboard): I'll tell you; they put it on [garble] more than that [garble].
094:14:06 Young (onboard): [Garble].
094:14:12 Stafford (onboard): Do it that way?
094:14:13 Young (onboard): Yes.
094:14:14 Stafford (onboard): Okay, they'll switch the TV [garble].
094:14:35 Young (onboard): Okay.
094:14:18 Stafford (onboard): That thing is all set up; let me recheck your Hasselblad for you. About, you know, f:11 at 1/250. You want this slide out [garble]?
094:14:30 Young (onboard): Yes.
094:14:41 Stafford (onboard): Okay.
094:14:59 Stafford (onboard): Okay. The only thing, as far as final details, you can [garble] the S-band, you can [garble].
094:15:05 Young (onboard): Okay. [Garble].
094:15:10 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] S-band, Attitude Deadband, the [garble] spacecraft [garble].
094:15:45 Stafford (onboard): [Garble]. Could you move that to my - [garble]?
094:15:50 Young (onboard): Yes.
094:15:52 Stafford (onboard): Yes. [Garble].
094:15:53 Young (onboard): [Garble] freaking hoses.
094:15:57 Stafford (onboard): Yes, [garble].
094:16:02 Young (onboard): [Garble].
094:16:03 Stafford (onboard): [Garble].
094:16:04 Young (onboard): [Garble].
094:16:05 Stafford (onboard): [Garble].
094:16:11 Young (onboard): [Garble] see this TV. It's sure getting dark out there.
094:16:17 Stafford (onboard): You're not in there.
094:16:22 Young (onboard): [Garble] retrack other one?
094:16:24 Stafford (onboard): No. No. That's OK.
094:16:30 Young (onboard): [Garble]?
094:16:31 Stafford (onboard): No. No, I want to wait. Get the S-band [garble].
094:16:35 Young (onboard): I don't know.
094:16:37 Stafford (onboard): Maybe they're down in one of these - [garble] here.
094:17:08 Young (onboard): Hey. Is that any part of it, right there?
094:17:13 Stafford (onboard): No. [Garble].
094:17:18 Young (onboard): I couldn't read the panel too...
094:17:20 Stafford (onboard): No, not too good. Couldn't get - No, that's part of the suit.
094:17:38 Stafford (onboard): Isn't that the suit [garble] in back of you, John?
094:17:41 Young (onboard): Yes. That's - No. Something like that. [Garble].
094:18:51 Stafford (onboard): [Garble].
094:19:09 Young (onboard): OK. If you want to stay ahead, you're going to have to go out to the LM.
094:19:11 Stafford (onboard): Right now? [Garble].
094:19:15 Young (onboard): Well - you'll be 30 minutes ahead if you go now. Because IVT [Intra Vehicular Transfer] to the LM is definitely Go...
094:19:23 Stafford (onboard): Well, I...
094:19:24 Young (onboard): ...activate ECS and checkout, connect with ECS, suit-fan water check, glycol pump check.
094:19:35 Stafford (onboard): I'm coming in. What, Gene-o? Two APCs; okay.
094:19:50 Stafford (onboard): You got [garble]? No, I've got [garble].
094:19:54 Young (onboard): Yes. Shit. You've got [garble].
094:20:32 Stafford (onboard): Okay, John, I am going to disconnect this. This suit [garble], right - here.
094:20:37 Young (onboard): Where?
094:20:38 Stafford (onboard): Right at them.
094:20:43 Young (onboard): Don't hang the hoses in the tunnel, because - I'm fixing to get the gear out first.
094:20:50 Stafford (onboard): Okay, Gene, I'm coming in. Okay. I'll let you configure the...
094:20:55 Young (onboard): Hold it. Wait, wait, wait. (Sneeze) Scat! Freaking thing.
094:21:00 Stafford (onboard): If you're not too tired, coming off?
Stafford transfers into the LM Snoopy.
094:21:04 Young (onboard): Huh? Yes.
094:21:26 Young (onboard): Take it easy. See you in a couple of hours.
094:21:29 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Okay.
094:23:28 Young (onboard): Okay, you guys, we're going back to the right attitude for acquisition.
Flight Plan page 3-52.
Flight Plan page 3-52a - Graphic.
This is Apollo Control; 94 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We should have Acquisition Of Signal now in the 10th revolution as Apollo 10 comes around from behind the Moon. We should, for the first time, begin hearing the call signs, Snoopy for the Lunar Module and here...
094:29:15 Young: Houston, Apollo 10. Over.
094:29:27 Lousma: Go ahead, Apollo 10. Houston.
094:29:33 Young: Roger. Tom and Gene are in the LM, checking things out.
094:29:39 Lousma: Roger. We copy.
094:29:40 Young: We've gotten through the steps. We changed the canisters. We've got the LM power on. LM cables are disconnected and stowed. I and Tom are in our PGAs, and you got the roll CAL from last night.
094:30:00 Lousma: That's affirmative. We have that.
094:30:27 Lousma: Apollo 10, this is Houston. We'd like to have the CMC for an uplink.
094:30:35 Young: Roger. Wait a second.
094:30:45 Young: I read you guys loud and clear.
094:30:57 Young: You have P00 and Accept, Houston.
094:30:58 Lousma: Houston. Roger.
094:31:10 Young: We just got a VHF B check and it's so much better than the simulator, Tom says you can't believe it, and I agree.
094:31:16 Lousma: Roger, 10. Thank you.
094:32:00 Young: Houston, Snoopy is giving you a call on S-band. This is Charlie Brown. Over.
094:32:04 Lousma: Okay, Charlie. We're not reading Snoopy yet.
094:32:23 Young: Are you reading them, Gene? They are reading you, there, Houston.
094:32:30 Lousma: Snoopy, this is Houston. We are not reading you.
094:33:50 Lousma: Hello Snoopy. This is Houston.
094:34:00 Young: Houston, Snoopy is calling you and he reads you apparently.
094:34:04 Lousma: Okay, Snoopy. Understand you are reading us. We are not reading you yet. You might try Downvoice Backup.
LM Backup S-Band Down Voice. The LM backup voice transmission is accommodated via S-band by routing the low pass filter output directly to a speech processing network. This network provides 24db of speech clipping. This mode is set by setting the Biomed Telemetry switch on panel 12 to Off and the Voice Functions switch to Dn Voice BU.
Biomed Telemetry & Down Voice BU switches - Panel 12.
094:34:29 Young: Oh, it's touchy comm!
094:34:37 Young: He is using Downvoice Backup.
094:34:42 Lousma: Hello, Snoopy. This is Houston. How do you read? Over.
094:34:47 Young: He wants to know how you read, Gene-o. You hear him?
094:35:00 Lousma: Charlie (Brown), this is Houston. We're not reading Snoopy.
094:35:03 Young: Roger. Roger. He's changing antennas now.
094:35:26 Cernan (in Snoopy): Hello, Houston, Houston, this is Snoopy. How do you read? Over.
094:35:31 Lousma: Hello there Snoopy this is Houston. Reading you now, but quite a bit of noise in the background. Over.
094:35:40 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay. How do you read me now, Jack?
094:35:42 Lousma: Okay, Snoop. I don't hear the noise now, but you're way down in the mud.
094:35:50 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay. I'll try and talk louder. The noise was because I was on ICS (intercommunication system) PTT (push to talk) Downvoice Backup and you had a high Freq in here. I'll bring you up to date. You might get your activation and checkout list out and wait a second - I'll Tell you where we are.
094:36:12 Lousma: Okay, Snoopy. We've got the - we've got...
094:36:13 Cernan (in Snoopy): Turn to page 20...
094:36:18 Cernan (in Snoopy): Tom. are you done - with ECS second?
094:36:18 Lousma: Snoopy, this is Houston. We've got the Checklist out. Go ahead. And, be advised you are still down in the mud.
094:36:20 Stafford (in Snoopy): [Garble]. Push.
094:36:28 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay. I'm yelling as loud as I can. We are on page 29. On page 29. I just finished the LGC self-test. The spacecraft is all Go; I found nothing wrong with it. Tom is in here suited. He's up through page 29. I'm ready to do the S-band TR power amplifier check, and then I will do the steerable check, and I will go out and get suited while Tom continues. Are you with me?
094:37:01 Lousma: That's affirmative, Snoopy. We are reading you.
094:37:08 Cernan(in Snoopy): Okay. I'm presently on high voltage taps, and I'm ready to go S-band transmitter/receiver secondary and power amplifier secondary. Are you ready?
094:37:18 Lousma: Stand by one. Snoopy, this is Houston. Go ahead.
094:37:23 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hey, John. I think I've got your helmet here.
094:37:28 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay. Go ahead and I'll wait 60 seconds.
094:37:30 Stafford (in Snoopy): John, do I have your helmet? I don't want the cover on it. How about giving me one of those other helmets.
094:38:18 Cernan (in Snoopy): Hello, Houston. Houston, this is Snoopy. How do you read on Secondary? Over.
094:38:25 Lousma: Snoopy, this is Houston. We have a lot of noise in the background; hearing you very weakly.
094:38:30 Stafford (in Snoopy): You're loud and clear to us.
094:38:36 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay. I read you loud and clear, I'll go back to Primary at this time.
094:38:40 Lousma: Roger; Hear you're going back to Primary.
As part of the S-band transmitter/receiver power amplifier checks, Cernan is selecting the Secondary power amplifier using the switch on panel 12. The quality of the comm via the Secondary power amplifier was not acceptable so he is now switching to the Primary power amplifier in an attempt to improve the quality. The power amplifier circuit breaker on panel 16 would already have been closed.
S-Band Power Amplifier switch - Panel 12.
094:38:47 Cernan (in Snoopy): Tom, are you checking these things off? How far along are you?
094:38:51 Stafford (in Snoopy): I'm squared - I'm waiting for - to get John on VHF A Simplex down there on the list.
094:38:56 Cernan (in Snoopy): Are you done with the suit fan check?
094:38:58 Stafford (in Snoopy): Oh, yes. that shit's all finished. I'm all finished, babe. I'm down to VHF A. Okay.
094:39:10 Stafford (in Snoopy): Go.. Coming to you. John.
094:39:13 Cernan (in Snoopy): Hello, Houston, this is Snoopy. I'm ready to do the S-band steerable antenna check.
094:39:31 Cernan (in Snoopy): Hello, Houston, this is Snoopy, I'm ready to do the S-band steerable check.
094:39:42 Young: Houston, this is Charlie Brown. Snoopy is ready to do the steerable S-band antenna check. Over.
094:39:55 Lousma: Snoopy, this is Houston.
094:39:57 Young: Houston, Charlie Brown. Over.
094:39:59 Lousma: Snoopy, this is Houston. Request you try turning your ranging switch Off. Over.
094:40:08 Young: They want you to try turning your ranging switch Off, Gene-o.
094:40:12 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay, Houston. This is Snoopy with the ranging switch Off. How do you read?

S-Band Function-Range switch - Panel 12.
094:40:16 Lousma: Okay. Gene, We're still hearing you very weakly, and a lot of background noise, over.
094:40:26 Cernan (in Snoopy): I don't doubt about the background noise. We got it in here, but I can't do anything except eat these mikes from here on out
094:40:45 Cernan (in Snoopy): Houston, this is Snoopy. I'm ready to go with the steerable test, if you're ready.
094:40:54 Lousma: Hello, Snoopy. This is Houston. Go ahead with the steerable check. Over.
094:41:04 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay. Hey, John, are you in the attitude as prescribed?
094:41:08 Young: Yes. Just about.
094:41:10 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay.
094:41:14 Lousma: Charlie (Brown), this is Houston. We're still reading Snoopy very weakly with a lot of background noise. You may have to relay some.
094:41:25 Young: Roger.
094:42:08 Young: Okay, Snoopy. We're at the attitude.
094:42:11 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay. And I should have good high gain lock. Hello, Houston, this is Snoopy. How do you read on high gain?
094:42:31 Lousma: Oh, that's much better now, Snoop.
094:42:38 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay. I don't know if that's any sign. That was a piece of cake. I hope it works that way.
094:42:45 Lousma: You're coming in loud and clear now, Snoopy.
094:42:52 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay, Jack. things are going, so far, real well up in here. I'm about ready to go off the loop here, go back and get suited up, and we'd like to stay ahead of the game if we can. All my voltages look real good. Just to bring you up to date: I'm, reading 30.2 on the commander's bus and 30.2 on the systems engineer's bus. Inverter number 2 is in the high side of the Green. Battery number 6 is reading 37 and battery number 5 is reading 37.
The LMP, Eugene Cernan has entered the LM Snoopy first to commence the systems activation, commencing with the Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS). Meanwhile, CDR, Thomas Stafford has remained in the more spacious CM where he has donned his pressure garment with the assistance of CMP, John Young. The LMP and CDR are about to swap roles, temporarily.
Cernan is commenting on the voltage of the two ascent stage batteries, 5 and 6. They are both currently displaying 37 volts DC. The inverter switch on panel 14 has been set to inverter 2 and is displaying the AC bus voltage on the Volts indicator also on panel 14. It is currently indicating at the top of the scale. The inverter output to the AC bus is regulated at 115 volts AC. Should the AC voltage fall below 112 volts DC, the Inverter caution light is illuminated on panel 2.
094:43:26 Lousma: Roger. We copy, Gene.
094:43:31 Cernan (in Snoopy): And our glycol temperature started out at about 70 or 75 and it's come down very slowly, and is now within the green band. I guess it's about 50 - 48 degrees right now. Our SHe pressure looks good, within the nominal limits; and our ambient pressure looks good; and our ascent helium pressures look good, also.
The primary glycol coolant loop temperature is being read from the indicator on panel 2. The temperature will normally settle out at 40 degrees F, it is cooling down from the initial high temperature as the pumps circulate the coolant to the cold plates and rails.
The descent propellant pressurisation is provided by supercritical helium (SHe) and ambient helium. The ambient helium provides prepessurisation of the descent propellants. The supercritical helium cannot be used for the prepessurisation because the helium circulating through the fuel/helium heat exchanger may freeze the fuel before the fuel flow is established. The supercritical helium is introduced after DPS ignition. Both the SHe and ambient helium tank pressures are monitored by selecting the required output on the Helium Mon(itor) rotary selector switch on panel 1 which will then display the reading on the Helium indicator also on panel 1. The initial ambient pressure should be on the order of 1,600 psia at 70 deg F (21 deg C), and the SHe pressure is nominally 1,555 psia at -400°F (-240°C).
The ascent engine propellants are pressurised by gaseous helium supplied from two tanks. The nominal pressure is 3,050 psia at 70°F (21°C). The ascent helium tank pressures can be monitor again by using the Helium Mon rotary selector switch on panel 1, selecting the appropriate tank and displaying the output on the Helium indicator.

094:43:55 Lousma: Roger, Snoopy. We copy.
094:44:00 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay. Jack, the next time I see you, I'll be dressed for the occasion.
094:44:04 Lousma: Roger. We'll be looking forward to it, and we'd also like to keep ahead a little bit.
Lousma is encouraging the crew to try and stay ahead of the Flight Plan time line, so as to have some time available to deal with any issues that may occur, especially considering this is only the second test flight of the LM and the first in lunar orbit.
094:44:08 Lousma: And, Charlie (Brown)...
094:44:11 Cernan (in Snoopy): That's okay, babe. I'm going back to suit up.
094:44:15 Lousma: Roger, Gene. And, Charlie Brown, we have a Landing Site 2 track pad when you're ready.
094:44:28 Young: Roger. Landing Site 2 track PAD, Go.
094:44:32 Lousma: Roger. 096:47:24, 096:52:24; 000, 270, 000, north 11 19 21 - what's this? - and your site is 130.
094:45:05 Young: Roger. 096:47:24, 096:52:24; roll, 0; pitch, 270; yaw, 0; north 11 miles.
094:45:22 Lousma: Roger, Snoopy. And we've got a 1921 and a 130.
The Landing Site 2 landmark tracking update is recorded on the Flight Plan as shown below.
130 (in Mare Tranquillitatis)

094:45:33 Young: Yes. Bet you.
094:46:11 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hello, Charlie Brown. Snoop would like to do a VHF A Simplex check now.
The VHF system is only used for voice communications between the two spacecraft and for ranging by the CSM. The VHF checks are carried out to confirm the correct system configuration in both spacecraft. The VHF B system has already been checked out satisfactorily. The following sequence is followed to configure the LM and test the VHF system:
On panel 12:
VHF A XTMR switch Voice, VHF A RCVR switch On, VHF B XTMR switch Data, TLM PCM switch Lo, Comm Ant: VHF select FWD, at the same time the CSM selects VHF Ant-SM Left.
Unstow the LMP outboard armrest to provide access to the LMP-ACA (Attitude Controller Assembly).
Audio: VHF A switch T/R (transmit / receive), Comm: TLM Biomed switch Off (the crewman should ensure the comm cable is not powered)
Request CSM remove transfer umbilical suit (used during IVT (Intravehicular transfer) between CM and LM by CDR and LMP) power.
When headset sound has ceased, disconnect the transfer umbilical comm cable from the PGA (Pressure Garment Assembly) and connect the LM comm cable to the PGA (transferring voice comm source from CM to LM).
On panel 16:
CB (circuit breaker) Comm: SE Audio close (push in), this supplies power to the crewman's comm carrier.
Perform VHF comm check with CMP in CSM, using the PTT on the ACA.
LM Attitude Controller Assembly.
Perform comm check with CMP in CSM, using the PTT/keyer on the umbilical.
PTT/keyer on the PGA electrical umbilical assembly.
Request verification of CSM reception of LM LBR (low bit rate) data, if desired. (The CSM cannot verify this LBR data onboard so it must be recorded on the CM DSE, the recorded data dumped to MSFN (Manned Spaceflight Network) where it is again recorded on the ground and the data verified.).
On panel 12:
Audio: Mode switch VOX (voice operated transmission)
Perform comm check with CSM using VOX, the audio volume, VOX sensitivity and the squelch settings should be adjusted at this time to suit the mission conditions.
Audio: Mode switch ICS/PTT
LM communications controls - Panel 12.
094:46:15 Young: Roger. Going VHF A Simplex.
094:46:18 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger, John.
094:46:26 Young: Snoopy, Charlie Brown. How do you read?
094:46:33 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger, Charlie Brown. This is Snoopy. I'm reading you loud and clear. How me?
094:46:43 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay.
094:46:44 Young: Snoopy, Charlie Brown. How do you read? Over.
094:46:45 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger. John, you're really blasting me out. I'm reading you loud and clear.
094:46:55 Stafford (in Snoopy): How do you read me, John?
094:47:06 Young: Snoopy, Charlie Brown. Do you read?
094:47:08 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger. I'm reading you loud and clear, John.
094:47:16 Lousma: Charlie (Brown), this is Houston. Snoopy is reading you. Over.
094:47:24 Young: Roger, I know it. I read him loud and clear on Bravo.
094:47:55 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hello, Charlie Brown. Snoopy. How do you read on Simplex A?
094:48:04 Young: Tom, I can hear you, but just barely. I've got the squelch turned all the way off.
094:48:13 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. You're coming through loud and clear. I'll tell you what, I'll increase the squelch here a little bit.
094:48:22 Stafford (in Snoopy): How do you read now, John?
094:48:30 Young: I can hear you talking in the background, but I don't understand anything you're saying. Let me switch antennas.
094:48:37 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay.
094:48:45 Young: Snoopy, Charlie Brown. Over.
094:48:47 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger John you're coming through and loud and clear.
094:48:54 Young: I don't hear you, Tom.
094:48:56 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay.
094:48:57 Young: Hey, can we go back to VHF B?
094:49:00 Stafford (in Snoopy): Let's go back to B Simplex.
094:49:22 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hello...
094:49:23 Young: Houston, this is Charlie Brown. Do you have any suggestions?
094:49:29 Lousma: Stand by one, Charlie.
094:49:30 Stafford (in Snoopy): Charlie Brown, Snoop. How do you read on VHF B? Can you read me on VHF B?
094:49:39 Young: I read you loud and clear, Tom.
094:49:41 Stafford (in Snoopy): Let's stay here.
094:49:43 Young: Okay.
094:49:50 Young: Can we try Duplex B? Over.
094:49:57 Stafford (in Snoopy): Stand by.
094:50:06 Stafford (in Snoopy): Go ahead on Duplex B.
094:50:20 Young: Snoopy, Charlie Brown. How do you read? Over.
094:50:21 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger. Loud and clear, John, really loud and clear.
094:50:33 Young: I can't hear you on Duplex B, Tom.
094:50:37 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. Let's go to B Simplex and stay there awhile, John.
094:50:48 Lousma: Charlie (Brown), this is Houston. Snoopy wants to go to B Simplex. He's reading you; you're not reading him.
094:50:57 Young: Roger. I read you loud and clear on B Simplex, Tom.
094:51:01 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger. I'm reading you loud and clear on B Simplex, too, John. Let's just stay here.
094:51:35 Young: Houston, Charlie Brown. Can you work this problem, please?
094:51:37 Lousma: We're working on it, Charlie (Brown).
094:52:44 Lousma: Charlie, this is Houston. We're finished with your computer. You can go to Block.
094:52:53 Young: Roger.
094:52:55 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay, Charlie Brown. Snoopy. You want to give me a time hack on Verb 16 Noun 65? Or your mission time. It doesn't matter.
Verb 16 displays the time on registers R1 in hrs, R2 in mins & R3 in secs to two decimal points, Noun 65 samples the AGC time.
This procedure is undertaken in both spacecraft with the CDR giving a countdown to co-ordinate the depression of the DSKY Enter key at the same time. The displayed time is compared. The LGC clock can be incremented if required to synchronise it with the CMC.
094:53:14 Young: Okay, Snoopy. Time hack follows: 94:53:17, 18, 19, 20.
094:53:26 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. We're in good shape, here, until we get an update. It looks good. Let's go, and give me Verb 05 Noun 01 1706, Enter. See if that's changed and give me the numbers, babe.
094:53:54 Young: Roger. Verb 05 Noun 01: three balls 12, 13256, 332, 66.
Verb 05 Noun 01 1706 Enter displays TEphem (time of ephemeris update) on R1, R2 and R3.
TEphem is a time value (24 bit time, expressed in centiseconds) which is the difference between the UTC time used for reference and the UTC lift-off time.
094:53:58 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. Got it. thank you.
094:55:05 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy. Over.
094:55:08 Lousma: Go ahead, Snoop. Houston standing by.
094:55:14 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. If you have high gain lock, I'm ready for my E-memory dump on page 33.
094:55:31 Lousma: Snoopy, this is Houston. Put your update link to Data, and we are ready for the E-memory dump. Over.
094:55:39 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay.
094:55:53 Stafford (in Snoopy): Updata link to Data and E-memory dump coming at you.
To initialise the E-memory dump the crew type Verb 74 Enter on the LM DSKY. This dumps the contents of all eight banks of the LGC memory for downlinking to MCC-H. The dump is automatically repeated to ensure the data is received correctly by MSFN. MCC-H can check the entire contents of the E-memory to establish if the LGC is operating correctly.
094:55:56 Stafford (in Snoopy): Mark.
094:55:58 Lousma: Roger, Snoop. We copy.
094:56:01 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hello, Charlie Brown. Snoopy here.
094:56:10 Young: Go ahead, Gene. This is John.
094:56:11 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay, José. How are you doing? I'm ready to do that docked alignment - the docked alignment if you are. How are you doing there?
094:56:25 Young: Okay. I'm about ready.
094:56:31 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay, John. When you get all squared away, we go in the minimum deadband attitude hold, hold the rascal tight; and then on your mark if you can give me Verb 06 Noun 20, and then just hold it until I get my alignment squared away.
Verb 06 Noun 20 in the CMC displays the present ICDU (Inertial Coupling Data Unit) angles, in roll, pitch and yaw to two decimal points on registers 1, 2 and 3. The 3 ICDU's provide an interface between the inertial subsystem and the computer. It functions primarily as an analog-to-digital or digital-to-analog converter. It converts IMU gimbal angles from analog-to-digital form, and supplies the CMC with this information. Stafford will be using these angles as part of the LM IMU coarse align.
094:56:52 Young: Okay. I'm going to SCS and then deadband.
094:57:04 Young: Okay. We're in Min deadband.
094:57:07 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. If you're in Min deadband attitude hold and when it all settles down there, give me Verb 06 Noun 20, and we'll have at it. Over.
094:57:16 Young: Roger. Verb 06 Noun 20: it's 13807 20094 00055.
094:57:34 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. Reading them back: number 1, 13807; number 2, 20094; number 3, 00055. Over.
The ICDU angles Young has passed to Stafford are: roll, 138.07°; Pitch, 200.94°; Yaw, 000.55°.
094:57:44 Young: That is correct.
094:57:45 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. Hold it there and we will be at it.
Comm break.
094:59:51 Lousma: Charlie Brown, this is Houston. We have your DAP update PAD when you're ready.
Flight Plan page 3-53.
095:00:01 Young: Roger. Go ahead.
095:00:03 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. John - John, you can go ahead and release it, the minimum deadband. We're all out on the course align and we're squared away.
The ICDU angles passed from the CSM 'Charlie Brown' need to be amended by manual calculations to take into account the difference in the orientation of the IMU's in the two spacecraft. Additionally the docking roll calibration angle must be read off the docking tunnel scribed scale and factored in to these calculations.
The calculation made is:
OGA LM = 300° + Rc - OGA CM
IGA LM = 180° + IGA CM
MGA LM = 360° - MGA CM
(OGA = Outer gimbal angle. IGA = Inner gimbal angle. MGA = Middle gimbal angle for the appropriate spacecraft.)
The relative spacecraft axis orientations.
The crew in the LM Snoopy enters the resultant angles into the LGC by keying Verb 41 Noun 20 Enter. The DSKY will flash Verb 21 Noun 22 requesting the crew to key in the angles in each axes to drive the LM IMU gimbals to this orientation. Whilst the CDR is performing this procedure in the LM, CMP John Young has set the DAP to deadband to narrow band ±0.5° so that the combined spacecraft orientation is kept within tight limits. Now that the coarse alignment is complete the minimum deadband can be opened to wideband ±5.0° to reduce the amount of CSM RCS activity.
095:00:11 Young: Okay. Go back to CMC in Auto.
095:00:14 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. And real fast here: if you can give me a Verb 06 Noun 20, we'll mark it forward and call the ground on a fine align.
095:00:26 Stafford (in Snoopy): Let me know and I'll give the Enter on Verb 06 Noun 20. Are you ready?
095:00:29 Young: Okay. Go ahead.
095:00:30 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. 3, 2, 1.
095:00:31 Stafford (in Snoopy): Mark it.
095:00:35 Young: You got it.
095:00:36 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. Read it to me babe.
095:00:37 Young: Let's do another one, Tom. I was a little late on that one.
095:00:43 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. Just a couple of seconds. Okay. Counting you down: 4, 3, 2, 1.
095:00:53 Stafford (in Snoopy): Mark it.
095:00:55 Young: Okay. Plus 13801, plus 20067, plus 00048.
095:01:12 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. Was the first one 138?
095:01:16 Young: Right. Plus 138.
095:01:17 Stafford (in Snoopy): 03801, plus 20067, plus 00048.
CDR Stafford has request a second readout of the ICDU angles so he can confirm the gimbal angles he has entered.
095:01:25 Young: Right.
095:01:26 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay.
095:01:56 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy.
095:01:58 Lousma: Go ahead, Snoopy.
095:02:02 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger. Did you read out that John's Verb 06 Noun 20?
095:02:08 Lousma: That's affirmative. We copied: 13801, plus 20067, plus 00048.
095:02:18 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. And here are my gimbal angles: plus 16070, plus 02023, plus 35973. Over.
095:02:31 Lousma: Okay, Snoop. We got you: plus 16070, plus 02023,plus 30 - correction - plus 35973.
CDR Stafford has now read up to MCC-H the IMU gimbal angles for them to be checked on the ground.
095:02:44 Stafford (in Snoopy): That is correct and we're still running about 35 to 45 minutes ahead of time. Over.
095:02:53 Lousma: Snoopy, this is Houston. We would like you to check your T-ephemeris. We think it's incorrect.
095:03:01 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. I'll recheck it. Thank you.
095:03:19 Young: Okay. I got three balls 12, 13256, and 33266 - here, Tom.
095:03:28 Stafford (in Snoopy): And that's exactly what I've monitored. If you read my DSKY, I've got it three balls 12, 13256, 33266. Over.
095:04:51 Young: Instant sunset.
095:04:56 Lousma: Roger, Charlie (Brown).
095:05:09 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy. I'm going to jump way ahead and get my rate gyro check out of the way.
095:05:14 Lousma: Roger, Snoop. We copy.
095:06:20 Lousma: Charlie Brown, this is Houston. We're going to have to do a P52 and then repeat step 7 on your activation 35.
095:06:38 Young: Okay. You've got to have a P52 first, huh?
095:06:41 Lousma: That's affirmative.
095:06:53 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hey, C.B. (Charlie Brown)?
095:07:02 Stafford (in Snoopy): You want to get this thing out of the way? You want to get this out of the way first?
095:07:06 Cernan (in Snoopy): I got to do a P52 right now, babe.
095:07:15 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy. I'm standing up here in the hatch. Do you want us to do a P52 right now or do you want us to start working on the hatch to get that out of the way? Over.
095:07:28 Lousma: Snoopy, we want you to get the P52 in before we go LOS, which is going to be in 33 minutes.
095:07:31 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. We'll both check this bear up here, John.
095:07:55 Cernan (in Snoopy): Hello Houston, Houston. This is the LMP back in Snoopy.
095:07:58 Lousma: Roger. We read you loud and clear, Gene-o.
095:08:05 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay, Jack. I'm getting on my hoses here and I'll be with you in a second.
Comm break.
095:08:38 Stafford (in Snoopy): Is that the way it's supposed to be?
095:08:40 Cernan (in Snoopy): I think that's right. You got your [garble]?
095:08:43 Stafford (in Snoopy): I'm sorry. It looks good to me.
095:08:55 Stafford (in Snoopy): I'm sorry. Gene-o.
095:09:22 Stafford (in Snoopy): I'm sorry. Turn the ...in and lock.
095:09:50 Cernan (in Snoopy): Are you done up there?
095:09:51 Stafford (in Snoopy): No.
095:09:52 Cernan (in Snoopy): Huh?
095:09:53 Stafford (in Snoopy): No. I got up to the...
095:09:55 Lousma: Charlie (Brown), this is Houston. Let's take an option 1 on that.
095:09:55 Cernan (in Snoopy): Go ahead.
095:09:56 Stafford (in Snoopy): Keep that on.
095:09:59 Cernan (in Snoopy): Who are you talking to?
095:10:01 Stafford (in Snoopy): John. I got the docked alignment in but they wanted a P52 in.
095:10:07 Cernan (in Snoopy): Did you look at that hatch real good babe?
095:10:10 Stafford (in Snoopy): I'm not ready to close it yet.
095:10:12 Cernan (in Snoopy): No, but did you look at the seal real good?
095:10:14 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. I wiped it off with a rag, and I'm going to rewipe it.
Stafford and Cernan are ensuring that the LM hatch seal is free of the Mylar insulation particulate contamination.
095:10:27 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay, Tom, how far are you - did you - do you are you still on Omnis or something?
095:10:32 Stafford (in Snoopy): Oh, yes. We still have 30 minutes left for contact with them.
095:10:36 Cernan (in Snoopy): Oh, okay. We're right here then, huh?
095:10:40 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes, I've already gone - I've got the E-memory up out of the way, and I've gone ahead and got the rate-gyro check out of the way. All that stuff is done now.
095:10:44 Cernan (in Snoopy): TEphem - this is all done?
095:10:45 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. Keep going. I got all that stuff done. All this is done. All that.
095:11:00 Cernan (in Snoopy): You got the alignment stuff in, too?
095:11:03 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. It's done.
095:11:06 Cernan (in Snoopy): How far did you go down here?
095:11:08 Stafford (in Snoopy): I got that done but they said we have to do it again since he didn't have a fine align. Okay, so we'll have to make another one.
This is Apollo Control.
095:11:18 Young: Aha! Today it picks up the LM.
We have 29 minutes left in this rev before Loss Of Signal. We're a little more than halfway across the visible face of the Moon in the 10th revolution.
095:11:20 Cernan (in Snoopy): What did he say?
095:11:22 Stafford (in Snoopy): Today it picks up the LM.
095:11:23 Cernan (in Snoopy): What picks up the LM?
095:11:26 Stafford (in Snoopy): Do we have any tape? Something to wedge.
095:11:30 Cernan (in Snoopy): No, not in here.
095:11:34 Stafford (in Snoopy): They told those people to leave that out?
095:11:40 Cernan (in Snoopy): Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy. I'm going to go ahead with the ascent battery activation and checkout at this time. Over.
095:11:49 Lousma: Roger. We copy, Snoop.
095:12:02 Stafford (in Snoopy): I'm going to turn the suit flow off and try to get these hooked up a little better.
095:12:33 Stafford (in Snoopy): That's the ECS probably, where you got it.
095:12:39 Cernan (in Snoopy): I just want the ascent batteries, Tom.
095:12:50 Cernan (in Snoopy): Houston, bus voltage on ascent battery alone looks like it's about 30 volts apiece.
There are two ascent stage batteries, numbers 5 & 6. The nominal voltage on ascent batteries alone is 28 VDC, so this readout is an indication that they are both healthy.
095:12:57 Lousma: Roger. We copy, Snoop.
Comm break.
095:14:20 Cernan (in Snoopy): I itch.
095:14:21 Young: Houston, you got those gyro torquing angles? Over.
095:14:26 Lousma: We're copying them down. Stand by.
095:14:40 Lousma: Okay, Charlie (Brown). We've got them.
095:14:45 Cernan (in Snoopy): Tom.
095:14:46 Stafford (in Snoopy): What?
095:14:47 Cernan (in Snoopy): Tom.
095:14:48 Stafford (in Snoopy): What?
095:14:50 Cernan (in Snoopy): Are you going to copy something down? Go ahead.
095:14:52 Stafford (in Snoopy): What do you need?
095:14:56 Cernan (in Snoopy): I want you to take this - see this chain? Just push it way down under my underwear. Just push it way down.
095:15:02 Lousma: Okay, Charlie (Brown) and Snoopy. We've got some switches for you to check on the VHF-A comm situation.
095:15:13 Cernan (in Snoopy): Way down. Just push it down. Okay? Okay.
095:15:15 Stafford (in Snoopy): For Snoopy.
095:15:15 Young: Roger. Go ahead.
095:15:16 Cernan (in Snoopy): It's down there now. I just wanted to make sure just push down under that underwear. Okay.
095:15:17 Lousma: Okay. For Charlie Brown: this is VHF/AM A Simplex basic check. Your VHF/AM A switch in Simplex, VHF/AM B in Off. VHF/AM receive only in Off, VHF ranging Off. And for Snoopy: VHF transmitter A to Voice, VHF receiver A to On, and on the commander's audio center your VHF A transmit/receive to TR.
095:16:00 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay. For Snoopy, that was VHF A transmit voice receiver On, and what was the last one?
095:16:04 Lousma: VHF receiver A to On, and on the commander's audio side, the VHF A TR to TR, and check all circuit breakers In.
From the Apollo 10 Final Flight Evaluation Report: "At 94 hours, 46 minutes, the commander attempted a transmission on Simplex-A; however, the circuit breaker supplying power for the keying relay was open, rendering VHF Simplex-A inoperative. Transmission on Simplex-A was attempted again at 95 hours 16 minutes. A check of switch positions for both spacecraft was performed. Both LM crewmen attempted unsuccessfully to transmit on Simplex-A. The commander then tried Simplex-B with no success; however, his Simplex-B switch had been left in the 'Receive' position from the previous check, and he could not transmit at the time. The commander then switched to 'Transmit/Receive' and Simplex-B performed satisfactorily. With the pressure of time, the crew decided to use Simplex-B. However, during the backside pass of revolution 11, VHF Simplex-A was tried again, and it performed satisfactorily The 'A' transmitter was used for both voice and ranging for the remainder of the flight. The most probable cause for the apparent failures of VHF Simplex-A was the numerous switch configuration changes in both vehicles. The two vehicles were not configured simultaneously for communications on Simplex-A."
095:16:20 Cernan (in Snoopy): Tom, you got - commander, are you on T/R?
095:16:24 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes, A. T/R, B is Receive.
Stafford is confirming the VHF system A and B settings on his audio panel 8.
Commander's audio panel showing VHF system switches - Panel 8.
095:16:29 Young: Roger. That was the setup I had there, Jack.
095:16:35 Lousma: Roger. Thank you, John.
095:16:38 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK we got them. Hello, Charlie Brown. Snoopy. How do you read on A Simplex?
095:16:48 Young: I read you same as before, Tom, which is unreadable.
095:16:52 Stafford (in Snoopy): Well, you try him.
095:16:53 Cernan (in Snoopy): John, do you read me any better?
095:16:57 Young (in Snoopy): Negative. I can hear you through the tunnel.
095:16:59 Stafford (in Snoopy): We've got problems.
095:17:03 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay. But you don't hear me any better, huh? Okay.
095:17:08 Cernan (in Snoopy): Tom. check all your circuit breakers over there, Tom.
095:17:10 Stafford (in Snoopy): I've got them In. I've got them In.
095:17:15 Lousma: OK, Snoopy and Charlie Brown, this is Houston. We're ready for you to do step 7 on your coarse align procedure.
095:17:27 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay, John. How do you read now?
095:17:36 Cernan (in Snoopy): Wait a minute. Let me...
095:17:37 Stafford (in Snoopy): We can't freak around...
095:17:37 Young: Okay. We're going to have to go back to - Okay, go ahead, Tom.
095:17:46 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay, John...
095:17:47 Young: Are you on Duplex B, Tom?
095:17:49 Stafford (in Snoopy): [Garble] Verb 06, Noun [garble].
095:17:50 Young: ...Simplex A?
095:17:51 Stafford (in Snoopy): ...and I'll count you down. Okay?
095:17:56 Cernan (in Snoopy): Can he read you, I wonder?
095:17:58 Stafford (in Snoopy): No.
095:17:58 Young: Hey, Tom, are you on Simplex A or B?
095:18:04 Stafford (in Snoopy): John, let's don't screw with them. Let's go on to B, and we'll get this stuff out of the way.
095:18:07 Cernan (in Snoopy): Go Simplex B, tell him.
095:18:09 Stafford (in Snoopy): Simplex B, babe.
095:18:11 Lousma: Charlie, this is Houston. He wants to go to Simplex B.
095:18:25 Young: Okay. How do you read. now?
095:18:27 Stafford (in Snoopy): John, I'm reading you loud and clear. How do you read me? Over.
095:18:33 Young: Now, I don't read you.
095:18:34 Stafford (in Snoopy): Ah, shit!
095:18:36 Cernan (in Snoopy): John, do you read me on Simplex B?
095:18:38 Young: Yes. Loud and clear.
095:18:41 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay, put your VHF...
095:18:42 Stafford (in Snoopy): Got it. Got it. Hey, John. We got it now. Let's go ahead with Verb 06, Noun 20, and tell me when you're ready, and I'll count you down. Over.
095:18:54 Young: Okay. Go.
095:18:56 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. 3, 2, 1.
095:19:00 Stafford (in Snoopy): Mark.
095:19:02 Young: Okay. Plus 13552, plus 19371, plus 00132.
095:19:16 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. I've got all those. Plus 13552, plus 19371, plus 00132. Over.
The crew are repeating the transfer of the ICDU angles.
095:19:24 Young: Check.
095:19:42 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay, Houston. This is Snoopy. Ready to copy my angles? Over.
095:19:45 Lousma: Go ahead, Snoop.
095:19:50 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. My angles at 06 20: plus 012. Pardon me, my first ... plus 16354, plus 01299, plus 35901, and I assume that you copy, John. Oh, pardon, that's 35906 on the last register.
095:20:06 Cernan (in Snoopy): 06, 06, Tom.
095:20:07 Stafford (in Snoopy): Oh, pardon us, 35906 on the last register.
095:20:10 Cernan (in Snoopy): Why don't you have them read them back?
095:20:14 Stafford (in Snoopy): He'll read them back. He should be able to read that.
095:20:17 Lousma: Okay, Snoopy. We copy, John. Then on yours we got plus 16354, plus 01299, plus 35906.
The LM IMU gimbal angles are again read up to MCC-H to be checked.
095:20:29 Stafford (in Snoopy): That's correct. Thank you.
095:20:33 Cernan (in Snoopy): And, Houston, this is Snoopy. The ascent batteries look good. The backup and normal feed is good. And my ED voltage is 37 on A and 37 on B.
095:20:45 Lousma: Roger. We copy. 37 on ED's.
095:20:48 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. We're ready for the probe and drogue.
095:20:54 Cernan (in Snoopy): Yes.
095:21:10 Stafford (in Snoopy): Charlie Brown, Snoopy. Our next step here - We got to have the hatch closed, so I'll stand by to help you with the probe and drogue when you're ready, babe.
095:21:19 Young: Roger.
Comm break.
Docking hardware.
CMP John Young is installing the CSM docking probe. The LM docking drogue is put in place by the Commander and checked by the CMP. Stafford now confirms that the probe capture latches are in place an engaged then he closes the LM upper hatch.
095:22:20 Stafford (in Snoopy): Here come the probe. Push there a little more. Okay. You got all three latches, John. No, they came out. They keep - they keep coming out. Now, it looks like you got them.
095:24:46 Cernan (in Snoopy): Houston, this is Snoopy. How about giving me the next LOS and the next AOS time, please?
095:24:52 Lousma: OK, Snoopy. Your next LOS will be at 95:40, and your next AOS will be at 96 27. And I have some LM gyro torque angles for you.
095:25:14 Cernan (in Snoopy): Stand by half a second.
095:25:45 Cernan (in Snoopy): Go ahead with your LM gyro torque angles.
095:25:48 Lousma: OK. LM gyro torque: X, minus 00730; Y minus 00700; Z, plus 00570.
095:26:08 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. I got X, minus 00730; Y, minus 00700; and Z is plus 00570. Is that correct?
095:26:18 Lousma: That's affirmative. You've got them right. There's one more thing we can try an our VHF situation. We may have the corona built up on our VHF A transmitter, so VHF A transmitter switch OFF for several seconds and then back to Voice. Over.
095:26:38 Cernan (in Snoopy): I don't think that will work Jack. When we just tried it again, it had been in the Off position. I put it to Voice. We'll give it a try here in minute, though.
095:26:45 Lousma: Roger.
095:26:52 Cernan (in Snoopy): I was suiting up while this comm problem started. Is it a VHF A Simplex mode?
095:26:57 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes.
095:26:58 Lousma: That's affirmative. Unable to transmit Snoopy to Charlie Brown on VHF A.
095:27:08 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay. That sort of blows the ranging capability doesn't it?
095:27:18 Lousma: That's affirmative.
With the apparent failure of the VHF transmitter, LM ranging data is lost. The backup procedure is to use the LM rendezvous radar to range the CSM.
095:21:30 Cernan (in Snoopy): That hatch good and clean, babe?
095:27:32 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. I've been cleaning it.
095:28:02 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes.
095:28:15 Cernan (in Snoopy): Houston, this is Snoopy. While they're closing off the probe and drogue and hatch, I'll copy some of those updates, burn update times, if you got them.
095:28:25 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay, John. Those latches are holding good.
095:28:29 Lousma: Roger. Stand by one, please.
095:28:47 Lousma: Okay, Snoopy. We have these burn times. They're nominal burn times; they'll change a little bit either way. Separation is 98:47:16. DOI, 099:46:02. Phasing, 100:58...
095:29:00 Cernan (in Snoopy): Wait a minute, Jack. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I can only copy them down one at a time. I want to copy them right in the book. Now go on with DOI.
095:29:19 Lousma: Roger. 099:46:02. Over.
095:29:30 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. Go on with phasing.
095:29:32 Lousma: phasing is at 100:58:25.
095:29:47 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. Insertion.
095:29:49 Lousma: Insertion is at 102:54:37.
095:30:00 Lousma: And, Charlie Brown, this is Houston...
095:30:01 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, and, I guess that's all we need right now, huh?
095:30:04 Lousma: Charlie Brown, this is Houston. Your roll jets to Disable, please.
095:30:13 Young: All roll jets - wait - wait a minute. We'll - OK, we'll disable the roll jets. Did we maneuver to the landmark tracking attitude with just the probe holding?
CMP John Young is checking whether the manoeuvre to the landmark tracking attitude should be made after the docking latches have been disengaged and the vehicles are only being held together by the docking probe capture latches. He would rather make this manoeuvre whilst the docking latches are still in place. The Flight Plan indicates that this manoeuvre should take place prior to disengaging the docking latches.
095:30:24 Young: We haven't released the capture latches yet, Jack.
095:30:28 Lousma: Roger. Stand by.
Comm break.
095:30:44 Stafford (in Snoopy): Looks like we're in pretty good shape ahead of time.
095:30:47 Cernan (in Snoopy): So far.
095:30:48 Stafford (in Snoopy): I'll get those things torqued in.
095:30:51 Cernan (in Snoopy): I got those numbers for you. I'll wait and let you do it.
Stafford is about to torque the LM gyros with the angles read up by MCC-H. This procedure uses LM program 52. Gyro Torque Only. Enter Verb 16 Noun 20. Input the outer, inner and middle gyro angles. When entry is complete enter Verb 50 Noun 25
095:30:53 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes, just - no hurry on it.
095:31:08 Cernan (in Snoopy): What is he doing?
095:31:10 Stafford (in Snoopy): He's working around up there doing something. I don't know what.
095:31:17Cernan (in Snoopy): Listen to that antenna, will you?
095:31:19 Stafford (in Snoopy): Just as long as it works, about 10 hours.
095:32:10 Young: Houston, this is Charlie Brown. Over.
095:32:15 Lousma: Go ahead, Charlie.
095:32:20 Young: Roger, What's the answer to that one?
095:32:22 Lousma: Okay. The answer to it is that, as soon as the tunnel is vented, you can use your roll jets. Over.
095:32:33 Young: Roger. Why don't we just maneuver to the attitude first then, and then preload the probe, then release the latches.
095:32:43 Stafford (in Snoopy): Be fine. While he's getting - Why don't we go ahead and torque this in?
095:32:57 Lousma: Charlie (Brown), this is Houston. Stand by one on rolling to the landmark track attitude. We'd like to update the LGC clock. Over. And we'll give you a GO when you can maneuver to the attitude.
095:33:10 Young: Roger. Roger. I'll go in there - I'll go in there and release the latches then.
095:33:18 Stafford (in Snoopy): Well, we better get our helmets on right.
095:33:21 Cernan (in Snoopy): He's going to release the latches. Yes, wait a minute. Tell him that.
095:33:27 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hey, John. Hold up. We'll get our helmets and gloves on here, and you can release them then .
095:33:39 Lousma: Snoopy, Houston. We'd like you to put your Updata Link switch to Data, please.
095:33:50 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay. It is in Data.
The Updata Link switch on panel 12 enables the DUA (Digital Uplink Assembly) to process digital uplinked data from MSFN.
Updata Link switch - Panel 12.
095:33:54 Young: Hey, Gene, you guys want to put your helmets and gloves on and release these latches?
095:33:57 Cernan (in Snoopy): Yes. I'll give you a call when we get them on, John, before you release them.
095:34:08 Cernan (in Snoopy): How does that look back there, Tom?
095:34:09 Stafford (in Snoopy): What?
095:34:11 Cernan (in Snoopy): My helmet.
095:34:12 Stafford (in Snoopy): Oh, yes. It's tilted too much. Just a minute. Oh - no - Let me - got it.
095:34:22 Cernan (in Snoopy): Squeeze it down around the back. Is that squeezed?
095:34:25 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. This freaking Velcro in this - both of these machines is horrible!
095:34:37 Cernan (in Snoopy): The Velcro is - is miserable.
The crew repeatedly bemoaned the functioning of the Velcro patches in both spacecraft and on their overalls and pressure suits. Pockets would open and tools float out, restraints to keep the crews feet on the LM floor would fail. They commented that the Velcro needed to have a higher shear strength to be effective.
095:35:05 Stafford (in Snoopy): And this ECS system isn't much better than what we squawked at in the altitude chamber. Soon as I start puffing I start breathing those - Gene-o, you want to give me one quick - push here?
095:35:30 Cernan (in Snoopy): You're not in a - in that Receive position...
095:35:32 Stafford (in Snoopy): Ah, shit I always try to leave it. Here we go. Go.
Comm break.
095:36:17 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay, Charlie Brown. We've got helmets and gloves on. You can open the latches.
CMP John Young has reinstalled the docking probe. He has preloaded the probe using the extend latch assembly to assert a load through the probe to drogue to ensure the load on the pressure seals between the two spacecraft is maintained once the docking latches are disengaged. LMP Eugene Cernan is giving CMP John Young the go ahead to retract the 12 docking latches. He releases them one at a time and cocks them in readiness for the next docking operation. He now reinstalls the CM forward hatch and performs a hatch integrity check to ensure a proper pressure seal. The two spacecraft are now being held together only by the docking probe capture latches engaged in the drogue.
CM docking latch and latch handle.
095:36:25 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. I've got the Cabin Gas Return to Egress...
The Cabin Gas Return valve is situated on the Suit Circuit And Canister Controls panel. It provides for return of cabin gas to the suit circuit under normal operations or provides suit integrity under rapid cabin decompression. In the Egress position, the valve is closed, ensuring the integrity of the suit circuit during unpressurised LM cabin operations.
Cabin Gas Return valve on the ECS Suit Circuit and Canister Controls panel behind the LMP station.
095:36:27 Cernan (in Snoopy): Don't we want to close that thing, Tom?
095:36:32 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. Tell him I'm going to close the hatch now.
095:36:37 Cernan (in Snoopy): Charlie Brown, this is Snoop. Do you read?
095:36:40 Young: Roger. Just a second.
095:36:42 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay. And we're closing our hatch at this time.
LMP is now closing and securing the overhead LM tunnel hatch.
095:36:44 Stafford (in Snoopy): That's about as clean as you can get it.
095:36:46 Cernan (in Snoopy): Push up on it. There you go.
095:36:49 Stafford (in Snoopy): Is that it?
095:36:53 Cernan (in Snoopy): That's it, babe.
095:36:54 Stafford (in Snoopy): Sure went in easy.
095:36:56 Cernan (in Snoopy): When this goes to Auto, let's make sure that we pull that thing down, after our check.
095:37:03 Stafford (in Snoopy): Make sure what?
095:37:04 Cernan (in Snoopy): When we go to Auto on that...
095:37:06 Young: Okay. And I'll disable the roll jets here.
095:37:13 Cernan (in Snoopy): Tom, put these up there where they belong now.
095:37:15 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. I'll put my bag over on the - You want to take your bag out of the way?
095:37:25 Cernan (in Snoopy): Yes.
095:37:37 Stafford (in Snoopy): I guess we should really go to Auto here.
095:37:38 Lousma: Snoopy/Charlie Brown. This is Houston. Our uplink is complete, and you have a Go for a maneuver to the landmark tracking attitude, and we have to have the OPS source pressure. Over.
095:37:43 Cernan (in Snoopy): Wait a minute. Let's see what it...
095:37:48 Stafford (in Snoopy): We've got to go to Auto. We don't...
095:37:49 Cernan (in Snoopy): Wait, wait. Let's...
095:37:53 Cernan (in Snoopy): Let's see what it says here.
095:37:55 Stafford (in Snoopy): When he vents the tunnel, he's going to suck us down.
095:37:57 Cernan (in Snoopy): Stand by one. Overhead Dump valve to Auto, Tom.
The Overhead Dump valve is situated on the LM overhead docking hatch. It provides for automatic LM cabin depressurisation and cabin pressure relief. In the Auto position, the valve can operate normally as an automatic pressure relief device.
Cabin Relief and Dump Valve.
095:38:01 Stafford (in Snoopy): Sure. Yes. Got to put that latch in there.
095:38:05 Cernan (in Snoopy): Pressure Regulator A and B, Cabin.
The Pressure Regulator A and B allows the Suit Press indicator to operate. Both valves must be set simultaneously to accomplish the desired pressure regulation. In the Cabin position, the regulated oxygen flow is permitted into the suit circuit at a maintained pressure of 4.8plus or minus 0.2 psia.
Pressure Regulator valves A and B on the ECS control panel.
095:38:08 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. Cabin.
095:38:12 Cernan (in Snoopy): Suit Gas Diverter valve, Push, Cabin.
The Suit Gas Diverter valve can be closed automatically by a signal from the cabin pressure sensor with the cabin pressure drops below 4.0 psia. The valve will also close automatically when the Press Reg A & B valves are set to Egress. In the Push-Cabin position, permits gas in the suit circuit downstream of the flow control valves to flow into the cabin.
Suit Gas Diverter valve is situated above the ECS control panel.
095:38:22 Stafford (in Snoopy): Push, Cabin. Okay, there's Cabin, Cabin - got an eye on Cabin...
095:38:27 Cernan (in Snoopy): Yes, I think - pull...
095:38:29 Stafford (in Snoopy): There. Okay. I've got the Cabin Gas Return, see, in case that thing blew out - that was open into our suit loop - the Cabin Gas Return. So we're okay. Cabin, Cabin, everything is sealed up. Cabin Gas Return is Auto and Suit Circuit Relief is Auto.
With the Cabin Gas Return in the Auto position it permits gas to flow into, but not out of, the suit circuit. The Suit Circuit Relief valve prevents overpressurisation of the suit circuit. In Auto it permits the valve to respond to aneroid device measuring suit circuit pressure.
Suit Circuit Relief valve on the suit circuit and canister controls panel.
095:38:48 Cernan (in Snoopy): Okay, Houston. This is Snoop. I read 5800 on both OPS's this morning when I came in.
095:38:55 Lousma: Roger, Snoop. We copy. 5800.
The OPS (Oxygen Purge System) is part of the Apollo EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit). It provides a backup source of oxygen should the primary supply from the PLSS (Portable Life Support System) fail or be expended. The OPS would also be used to supply oxygen to the LM crew should they need to make a contingency transfer between the LM and the CSM, going EVA and entering the CM via the main hatch. The pressure of the oxygen stored in the OPS should be at 5880 psia ±500psia. The readout Cernan has given indicates the OPS are in good health and ready for use if required.
095:39:28 Cernan (in Snoopy): Tom, will these things snap back there? They will. They ought to be snapped.
095:39:31 Stafford (in Snoopy): What's that?
095:39:32 Cernan (in Snoopy): I'll try and do it.
095:39:38 Stafford (in Snoopy): Do we have those gyro torquing angles?
095:39:41 Cernan (in Snoopy): Yes.
095:39:58 Cernan (in Snoopy): Right here, Tom.
095:40:01 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay, wait a minute.
095:40:03 Cernan (in Snoopy): Let me snap these things down out of the way.
095:40:04 Lousma: Snoopy, this is Houston. We are 1 minute from LOS. I recommend you lock your high gain antenna. Over.
The LM S-band steerable antenna has to be turned off when not in use. This prevents equipment damage due to possible overheating if the antenna drives to the stop after loss of phase lock due to Loss Of Signal with MSFN as the combined spacecraft go behind the Moon. This is done by placing the Track Mode switch on panel 12 to the Off position.
Track Mode switch - LM panel 12.
095:40:16 Cernan (in Snoopy): Roger. thank you.
095:40:53 Cernan (in Snoopy): Did you get those numbers, Tom?
095:40:54 Stafford (in Snoopy): 00730, right?
095:41:05 Cernan (in Snoopy): They can take the Velcro that's on these spacecraft and - I don't know what the hell they can do with them, but they can give it back. Ain't worth a damn.
095:41:08 Lousma: Charlie Brown, this is Houston. We notice an increase in your O2 flow. Recommend two return valves Closed with your helmets and gloves off. Over.
Young, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "When I removed my helmet and gloves, I got an O2 Flow High warning light; the reason for that was that the inflow valve had been closed as per checklist. I opened the inflow valve, but you know I was kind of nervous, because it indicated that we had a pressure leak, and when I vented the tunnel, the tunnel would not vent."
Young (continued): "...it was partially caused by the fact that it (inflow valve) was clogged by Mylar insulation that had been sucked in the second time and the other thing that caused it was that, when you have your helmet and gloves off with the inflow valve closed, you get a O2 Flow High (warning light). That's a standard operating factor."
095:41:37 Stafford (in Snoopy, onboard): Does the suit circuit flow hot and cold?
095:41:45 Cernan (in Snoopy, onboard): Yes. These god-dang things - we got to snap them after we get the helmets and gloves off. This Velcro is about as useless as a - god-dang!
095:42:03 Stafford (in Snoopy, onboard): It's all set. You want to - Okay. Is that a 3 or a 5?
095:42:15 Cernan (in Snoopy, onboard): Minus 00730.
095:42:17 Stafford (in Snoopy, onboard): Okay, I got the rest of them.
095:42:20 Cernan (in Snoopy, onboard): Minus 00700 and plus 00570.
095:42:24 Stafford (in Snoopy, onboard): OK.
This is Apollo Control. We've had Loss Of Signal as the Apollo 10 spacecraft went behind the Moon in this 10th revolution. We've got about 45 minutes, 15 seconds until Acquisition Of Signal again. We've got about 14 minutes of colour video tape to play back from the May 21st TV feed from the spacecraft to the Madrid tracking station, which was videotaped there and the tape flown to this country for a play back, and it was not relayed in real time. We'll roll this tape now.
095:43:37 Cernan (in Snoopy, onboard): Charlie Brown, this is Snoop. How are you doing?
095:43:39 Young (onboard): Roger. I've got them all unlatched and I'm visually inspecting them to make sure that they're all back.
095:43:45 Cernan (in Snoopy, onboard): Okay, give us a call when you get ready to - you know, vent that tunnel down there, and we'll watch our pressure.
095:43:52 Young (onboard): Roger.
095:44:36 Young (onboard): Okay, they're all released, Gene; and they look good. They're all well back from the [garble].
Young is checking the state of the docking latches.
095:44:44 Cernan (in Snoopy, onboard): OK.
095:44:50 Young (onboard): 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
095:46:50 Cernan (in Snoopy, onboard): Yes.
095:46:52 Stafford (in Snoopy, onboard): [Garble].
095:48:11 Young (onboard): Okay, Snoopy, the hatch is installed. I'm ready to vent the tunnel. Over.
095:48:16 Cernan (in Snoopy, onboard): Okay, we're watching it. Go ahead, John.
095:49:56 Young (onboard): Okay, you guys, give me a second or 2 to get a ... out of here.
095:50:00 Cernan (in Snoopy, onboard): OK.
095:50:17 Young (onboard): Shit!
095:51:48 Young (onboard): Okay, going to Vent.
095:51:50 Cernan (in Snoopy, onboard): OK. Go slow.
095:52:48 Young (onboard): Okay, have you got your Dump valve in Auto? Over.
095:52:53 Cernan (in Snoopy, onboard): That's affirmative. It's in Auto.
Cernan is confirming that the LM overhead Cabin Relief and Dump Valve is in the Auto position.
095:52:55 Young (onboard): Roger. I went to - I've been to Tunnel Vent, and nothing's happening.
Young is referring to the LM Tunnel Vent valve, the controls for which are on CM panel 12. With the valve in the LM Tunnel Vent position, the LM tunnel will be depressurized, venting the tunnels atmosphere out into space. This allows the integrity on the CM forward hatch pressure seals to be checked.
LM Tunnel Vent valve controls - CM panel 12.
095:53:16 Cernan (in Snoopy, onboard): We're holding pressure here.
095:53:22 Young (onboard): Roger. You understand my LM/Command Module Delta-P gauge is changing?
095:53:33 Cernan (in Snoopy, onboard): Yes, what about - Isn't there a Tunnel Delta-P position on that?
With the LM tunnel vent valve control in the LM/CM Delta-P position, the atmosphere in LM tunnel is connected to the Delta-P gauge, allowing the pressure differential betwen the LM tunnel and the CM cabin to be measured.
095:53:44 Young (onboard): Yes, there is. If this is what it takes, it's going to take a month to get it out this way.
Young is getting exasperated by the rate the tunnel pressure is dropping.
095:53:48 Stafford (in Snoopy, onboard): Yes, it's supposed to take quite a while.
095:53:55 Cernan (in Snoopy, onboard): Yes. I hope we're having the same pressure as you are. We don't want that one to decrease.
095:54:09 Stafford (in Snoopy, onboard): I remember Dave Scott said it takes quite a while.
095:54:14 Young (onboard): Yes, but we ain't got quite a while.
095:54:15 Stafford (in Snoopy, onboard): Yes. Look if there's any problem - hell, go ahead and maneuver, John.
095:54:22 Young (onboard): Alright.
095:54:41 Cernan (in Snoopy, onboard): [Garble]?
095:54:42 Young (onboard): Yes.
