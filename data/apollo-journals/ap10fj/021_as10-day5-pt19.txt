099:56:00 Stafford (in Snoopy): Beautiful. It throttled up to 20 per cent. Thrust chamber pressure went down to 20 per cent, but the throttle profile looked good.
The DOI burn occurred whilst the LM was behind the Moon. Data recording was in low bit rate, so detailed data on the DPS performance was not obtained. The result of the manoeuvre indicates that the DPS performance was very close to nominal. The burn was initiated at 13.1 per cent throttle setting and the throttle was advanced to 40 per cent at approximately 14 seconds until its conclusion.
099:56:07 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): I've go got some updates on there, I've got to copy down, Tom.
099:56:11 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): OK.
099:56:15 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): The first one is - What does it say on there?
099:56:20 Young (onboard): I show you in a 61.2 by 9.22 [nautical miles, 113.3 x 17.1 km].
LM orbit following DOI is resolved by CSM VHF ranging.
099:56:23 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Beautiful.
099:56:24 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Beautiful, John. Beautiful.
099:56:26 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): I've got to copy this thing right here. 100 degrees East at 33:31.
Cernan is getting an idea of the time remaining to the phasing burn. The LM Snoopy should pass 100° east longitude, 33:31 prior to the phasing burn ignition. This information was passed up to the crew as part of the phasing burn PAD.
The Phasing burn is performed with the DPS engine. This posigrade manoeuvre is used to establish a CSM lead angle equivalent to that which occurs at the cut-off of a nominal powered ascent from the lunar surface. This manoeuvre elevates the LM apolune to approximately 195 nm (361 km), placing the LM in a 'dwell' orbit to allow the CSM to overtake and be in the correct relative position at the time of the LM insertion burn. At the time of the phasing burn, the CSM is 9 degrees behind the LM and at the insertion burn it will be 16 degrees in front.
099:56:43 Young (onboard): [Garble] are you guys [garble] down in there?
099:56:47 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): I can tell, José. We're just going to be hot to get clearance around the other side for a final approach, but we're coming down, baby.
099:57:19 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): These are 10-minute hacks? Or 90 minute - They've got to be 10 minute hacks, not 10 second hacks.
099:57:23 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes, yes, yes.
099:57:26 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Alright. Take that.
099:57:35 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Tell you what let's do. Let's go ahead and load the phasing burn in unless we have an update for it. He hasn't given us an update has he?
099:57:48 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): No, call up 30 and let's load it in.
P30 is used to load the ignition time and the required Delta-V in each axis into the LGC, for burns of the DPS, APS and some RCS manoeuvres. This load is for the LM phasing burn. Once the TIG and Delta-V have been loaded, the LGC will flash Verb 06 Noun 42 and display what it expects the resultant orbit will be following this manoeuvre.
099:57:58 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): OK. So what's the time of it? I'll take it, Gene-o.
099:58:00 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Shit.
099:58:09 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): You got it right here, babe?
099:58:11 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes. Plus...
099:58:13 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): 100:58:25.20.
Cernan is reading out the phasing burn ignition time from the PAD Duke read up to him on the previous revolution. Stafford inputs this time as part of the P30 setup.
099:58:18 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): OK. Proceed.
099:58:44 Young (onboard): Holy smoke!
099:58:46 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): What?
099:58:47 Young (onboard): [Garble] down below the horizon.
099:58:50 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Yes, I believe it.
099:59:34 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): How much has that changed?
099:59:36 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): 5 seconds.
099:59:38 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): OK.
099:59:43 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): It's going to put us in a 191.8 by 11.6 [nautical miles, 355.2 x 21.4 km].
This is the P30 prediction for the resultant orbit in nautical miles following a nominal phasing burn.
099:59:56 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): OK.
Flight Plan page 3-58.
100:00:11 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Oh, shit!
100:00:13 Young (onboard): [Garble] tracking you guys.
100:00:14 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): OK, John.
100:00:28 Young (onboard): [Garble] fantastic.
100:00:30 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Baby. Oh, God! It'd be worthwhile to take some pictures right here.
100:00:39 Young (onboard): I can see the whole LM.
100:01:10 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Whoa, we're dropping down, Gene-o.
100:01:13 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): You bet your life we're dropping down.
100:01:54 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): The landing site is at 10:30, Tom.
100:01:59 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): 10:30.
The phasing PAD informed the crew that the LM Snoopy will pass over landing site 2, 10:30 prior to the phasing burn ignition.
100:02:03 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): You went P - through P30, huh?
100:02:04 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes. We're all loaded.
100:02:07 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Good.
100:02:08 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Phasing at 47; we pitch down 90 degrees.
100:02:12 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Right with it.
100:02:14 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): To PDI.
100:02:23 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): OK, at minus 40, yaw left 180? Right?
100:02:28 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Minus 47, we pitch down 90. And at 42, we yaw left 180.
The Flight Plan calls for the LM to pitch down 90 degrees at phasing minus 47 minutes, and then to yaw left 180 degrees at phasing minus 42 minutes.
100:02:36 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Beautiful. Look at those bears.
100:02:39 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): OK, that's 40...
100:02:41 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Where's my Hasselblad again? [Laughter.]
100:02:42 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Take them, babe, while you're coming down here.
100:02:46 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): This Velcro doesn't hold anything.
100:02:48 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Aw, shit!
100:02:49 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): That's the problem?
100:02:52 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Everything I turn around, the Velcro won't hold the Hasselblad.
100:02:56 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Well, babe, you can't - It's not in there?
100:02:58 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): No, I've got a mag. Do you have it over there?
100:03:02 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): No, you were shooting John.
Stafford is looking for the Hasselblad camera. Cernan reminds him that he was the last to use it, when he was photographing the CSM during station keeping.
100:03:03 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes.
100:03:04 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): This Velcro isn't worth a tinker's dam. There's no telling where it is now, babe. We got to find that before we go over that landing site. Look down on the deck.
100:03:23 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): No. Oh, here it is. Way back here. Got it. Got it. Got it.
100:03:34 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): They can take this damn Velcro and give it back to - whoever thought they invented this kind of Velcro.
100:03:49 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): OK. Coming down here we should be on black and white - f:4 at 250.
100:03:54 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): That's right.
100:03:55 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): f:4 at 250?
100:03:56 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): f:4 at 250th.
100:04:19 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): You know, this place is starting to look at home.
100:04:22 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Yes.
100:04:57 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): What are you taking, 6?
100:04:58 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Huh? I'm taking these at 6, and then I'm going to - I got to pick up this landing site at 33 min - 34 minutes when you roll back again.
Cernan has set the Maurer 16-mm sequence camera running at 6 frames per second as they make their low pass.
100:05:17 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Some of those little bitty bears have black stuff in them.
100:05:41 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): John, are you still reading us?
100:05:46 Young (onboard): Loud and clear.
100:05:48 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): OK. I just - you know, when I don't hear from you, I begin to wonder.
100:05:59 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): I tell you, babe, we's getting down among dem.
100:06:17 Young (onboard): Yes. I guess you're about straight under me now - 14 miles.
Young is estimating the LM Snoopy, to be 14 nautical miles [26 km] below the CSM Charlie Brown at this point.
100:06:23 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): I know why the AGS didn't work. That was my fault, babe. I didn't set it up for external Delta-V, but we got a good perigee out of it - 8.6.
See explanation of the error at 099:43:34.
100:06:31 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Rendezvous...
100:06:32 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): That was my fault.
100:06:33 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Oh, shit. Go ahead
100:06:53 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): There's what I call Jack's crater. Nice little volcano that I shot yesterday. It really stands out.

100:07:12 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Do I get a Verb - OK, we're synced. I want to Proceed out of here and get a Verb 82 - Verb 83.
Verb 83 is used to initiate routine 31 which displays rendezvous parameters calculated by the LGC. It will display Range, Range Rate and Theta. The Range and Range Rate are calculated by the LGC using the stored LM and CSM state vectors. The Theta is the angle between the LM +Z axis and the local horizontal plane at the current time, referenced to the direction of flight.
100:07:22 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Yes. Good idea.
100:07:23 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Mark.
100:07:35 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Do you know where the hell we really are, Tom?
100:07:40 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): No, I've got no idea, babe, right now.
100:07:43 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Hey, I don't mean that way. What's this big - coming up on 50 minutes. I don't know what that big mother is there, but you're going to pitch around here anyway at 47, aren't you?
50 minutes to phasing burn ignition.
100:07:53 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yep.
100:07:56 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): There's 329. That's pretty close. Where's Hermann's site. Is this Gene-o's?
In 1969, many of the features on the Moon's farside had yet to be identified and named by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The mare or basins were given Roman numerals as identifiers. Smaller craters were identified using Arabic numerals.
Stafford has misidentified a feature as crater 329. Crater 329 is today know as Maunder and is situated within the northern half of Mare Orientale. This crater is approximately 120° behind their current location.
Crater 329 in Mare Orientale shown on Lunar Farside chart 1 (LFC-1).
100:08:14 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Man, that's the prettiest volcanism I've seen..
100:08:18 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Hey, here's crater IX right here, I'll bet.
100:08:19 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes.
100:08:18 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Right here.
100:08:23 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes, we're coming up to crater IX. José, we're coming up to crater IX, I think. We'll be going straight across it.
Crater IX is now known as Mendeleev.

100:08:28 Young (onboard): Roger.
100:08:31 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Maybe you could tell us better where we are, babe.
100:08:33 Young (onboard): We're going right across old number IX. Sure are.
100:08:41 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Things are starting to move faster, John.
100:08:48 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): OK, Tom, all our - everything's looking good there, so far.
100:08:53 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): You know, instead of going there and yawing over 180, let's take some strips here. See, instead of yaw - phasing? Yaw left.
100:09:04 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Yes. and I would...
100:09:05 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Screw it! We're just going to stay here and take some photo stripping instead of - John?
100:09:11 Young (onboard): Yes?
100:09:12 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): OK. Instead of yawing left and yawing right, I'm just going to stay here and take some - I think it would be more interesting for the whole thing just to take strip maps here.
Stafford has decided to amend the planned changes in the LM attitude to simplify matters and maintain an attitude which will allow strip photography.
100:09:20 Young (onboard): I think you're right.
100:09:24 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): I'll buy that.
100:09:26 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): How about that, Gene-o?
100:09:29 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): The important film we want to get is down below, babe.
100:09:31 Young (onboard): Hallelujah.
100:09:38 Young (onboard): [Garble] be coming upside down.
100:09:41 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yeah.
CSM solo operations detailed Flight Plan, page 30
100:09:49 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Man, look at those craters!
100:10:00 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Tom, give me that when you get a chance.
The crew are sharing the Hasselblad camera.
100:10:01 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): You got it, babe.
100:10:19 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Look at that big one.
100:10:20 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): That's what I'm looking at.
100:10:22 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): My monocular's.
Stafford wants the monocular for a close look at the features they are observing.
100:10:26 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Hey, when I can't see the horizon, Tom, I get the feeling like we're in a dive bombing run.
100:10:29 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yeah.
100:10:35 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): OK, at 47 minutes - OK, you're going to stay at this attitude. That's fine.
47 minutes to phasing burn ignition. Cernan is confirming that Stafford has decided to change the attitude they will be flying.
100:10:45 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Did you ever call up Verb 83?
100:10:47 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yep. You're all set.
100:10:49 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): I wanted to check it against the AGS. Let me look at it again.
100:10:59 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Hey, there are some huge boulders.
100:11:01 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): You've got some?
100:11:02 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): You're damn right!
100:11:04 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Look at those bastards down in that crater.
Stafford's tone is very excited.
100:11:07 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Right here?
100:11:08 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes, that big deep one, right down below here.
100:11:09 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Let me look at them. Let me look at that- let me look at this one here. I - I just took a picture of it.
100:11:20 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): That hole right down below us there.
100:11:23 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Oh, you bet your ass there's some huge boulders down there.
100:11:33 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Tremendous boulders.
100:11:34 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Man, there are, Tom.
100:11:37 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Hey, John, with that monocular, you can really see some boulders now, babe.
100:11:41 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): You know, the surface around it looks fairly good, though.
100:11:42 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yeah.
100:11:43 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Here you go. You want this back?
100:11:46 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): You want the Hasselblad?
100:11:47 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Yes, I'll take pictures of it.
100:11:54 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Wish I could have got right down in that - right down in among those boulders - I tell you, there's some boulders down there, babe. Are we yaw a little?
100:12:08 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Yeah, just a little bit.
100:12:11 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Look at this cliff there, Tom, right in front of us.
100:12:13 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes. There's a cliff there that's at least two or three thousand feet (600 meters or 900 meters) tall.
100:12:16 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Oh, hell, yes. At least...
100:12:19 Young (onboard): Hey, you guys are really out there now.
100:12:21 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Oh, you know it, babe.
100:12:26 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Holy smoley, John. This is incredible!
100:12:34 Young (onboard): [Garble].
100:12:35 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Yes. You thought we were close at 60 miles!
100:12:37 Young (onboard): I still think we're [garble]. Does the terrain seem any different color down close to you?
100:12:47 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): No, I don't think so.
100:12:49 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): With the monocular, you can see some stuff.
100:12:50 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): But I'll tell you, there's some good sized boulders on the sides of these craters. Some of them are very obviously impact. But then there are some others that - look...
100:13:02 Young (onboard): [Garble].
100:13:03 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): They got to be - they got to be - volcanic.
100:13:23 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Time hack at 100 - 113:21.
100:13:27 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): John, do you know where we are? What we're over?
100:13:29 Young (onboard): No, I lost you, I gave it to the Auto optics and it screwed up and I lost you.
Using program 20, option 4, the CMC can point a specified spacecraft vector along the line of sight to the Lunar Module while constraining the spacecraft's rotation about this vector. This option is used to acquire the Lunar Module in the sextant field of view and maintain the line of sight.
100:13:35 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Oh, OK. Because I'm going to tell you when I think we're about over Neper, because we've got to photograph that area coming down.
100:13:41 Young (onboard): OK.
100:13:43 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Tom, you want this over there?
100:13:45 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yep.
100:13:46 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): (Cough) Get me that thing.
100:13:47 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): You've got it.
100:13:57 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Oh, look at that bear. Here's an old one. Hey here's - Gene-o - there's...
100:14:02 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): What are you looking at?
100:14:03 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Son of a bitch! I don't know.
100:14:04 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Holy smoley! Hey, look at that black thing in the bottom. Let me see what it is.
100:14:06 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Look at all those black things. Hey, John, I got something that's really standing out here-like-oh gee, can you ever see it! The monocular, Gene-o, the monocular.
Both LM crew members are getting very excited about what they are seeing close up.
100:14:10 Young (onboard): What are they?
100:14:19 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Alright. That's a fantastic crater. I don't know where that is...
100:14:21 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Let me look at it. Oops. Let me look at it.
100:14:32 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): They're big boulders, John. Gigantic! We're looking straight down.
100:14:43 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Gee, I'm really getting vertigo here.
100:14:47 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Yes, it's like - like that rendezvous from above, Tom, when we were looking straight down at the mother.
Cernan is referring to one of the rendezvous he and Stafford made with an ATDA (Augmented Target Docking Adapter) during Gemini GT-9A, in Earth orbit in 1966.
100:14:53 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): I nearly lost him - lost him in the light. I need to slant up some more.
100:14:58 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): OK. We're coming up on 43 minutes.
43 minutes to phasing burn ignition.
100:15:15 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Are you in Orb Rate? No, you're in Inertial, aren't you?
Cernan is referring to the ORDEAL FDAI 1 switch setting. With it in the Inertial position, the CDR's FDAI will display the spacecraft's attitude with respect to the IMU.
100:15:18 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): I'm Inertial. Need to be pitched up more.
100:15:22 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Your ball isn't moving. Is it?
100:15:24 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yeah, it is. Sure it is.
100:15:25 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): OK.
100:15:28 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Your's is moving, isn't it?
100:15:30 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Yes. We want to be seeing 180 upside down when we come into Neper here.
The FDAI ball will be inverted.
100:15:39 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): I pitched over too far. What I wanted to see, I didn't get.
100:16:01 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): This camera is getting red hot.
100:16:09 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): OK, babe, at 34 minutes, we want to be pitched up, because we will be approaching into the Neper area where we want to get - this - see, Neper here's at 34 minutes - we'll be right in here. We want to start looking - be seeing Neper coming over the horizon.
100:16:20 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes. (Cough)
100:16:34 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Look at that [garble] volcanic as the dickens. Let me have the Hasselblad.
100:16:42 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Let me see that a minute.
100:16:43 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): You've got it.
Cernan has now taken the monocular.
100:16:44 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Yes. There are a lot of - a lot of things got to be volcanic, babe.
100:16:59 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): And there's boulders down in those holes. Look at that new one.
100:17:10 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Now, that's all black in the bottom.
100:17:12 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes. That's black.
100:17:19 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): That little - that little crater with the fresh - you know, everything being fresh, it appears to me that the top of the soil - the soil is bleached by the Sun.
100:17:27 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yeah.
100:17:32 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): There's one.
100:17:45 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): There is a fresh - and look at the boulders on the side of that one.
100:17:48 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): You got it - got it..
100:17:50 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Give me that camera, babe.
100:17:52 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): OK. I got some - here.
100:17:53 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): OK.
100:17:54 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Here. Where is the monocular?
100:17:55 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): There it is.
100:18:00 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Oh the 250 (mm lens) right here would have gotten something.
100:18:12 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Oh, look at those boulders!
100:18:14 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Aren't they fantastic?
100:18:22 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): 40 minutes, babe. At 34, we ought to start coming into the Neper area.
40 minutes to phasing burn ignition.
100:18:34 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Now look at that one. The way those cliffs are so sheer. There's black underneath them, and when these fresh craters come out, there's - it's all white soil.
100:18:43 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes. Here's one that's coming right there.
100:18:50 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Oh, beautiful.
100:18:53 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): It's black. A landslide and there's a boulder so damn big you can't believe it.
100:18:58 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Let me see. Trade you. Here.
Cernan wants to swap the Hasselblad camera for the monocular, so he can see in close up what Stafford is describing.
100:19:06 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): There's a little crater on the rim of this one, and there's boulders laying halfway down.
100:19:14 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): You can see where the volcanism started, and it rolled out there.
100:19:24 Cernan (onboard Snoopy) I - I got to say, there's a lot of impact craters around here, though. God dang.
100:19:29 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes, there are.
100:19:30 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): A lot of impact craters. You know, this planet must have been beaten to death at one time.
100:19:37 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Oh, you know it.
100:19:41 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Must have been beat to death. OK, Tom, we're coming down to 34 minutes, and that's where we're going to start picking up - Neper ought to be coming over the horizon at 29:31. We ought to be coming over the be right over Neper.
100:19:53 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): OK. Landing Radar - Landing Radar circuit breaker Closed at 22 minutes.
The Landing Radar circuit breaker on panel 11, will be closed at 22 minutes before the phasing manoeuvre.
100:19:59 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): OK, we're ahead of time. We don't - we're in good shape right now.
100:20:09 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): There's boulders in every one of those little - little craters and on - on the ridges.
100:20:14 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes. That's on the new craters - even a few of the old ones have them right down at the bottom.
100:20:19 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): And the boulders are black. They're black...
100:20:22 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): They look like they're a mare.
100:20:23 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): ...and yet - and yet the stuff that comes out of the new craters is white.
100:20:26 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): White, but there's black around them.
100:20:27 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Yes. And there are some pretty sharp cliffs. Some of these seem to be windblown down, but there are some awful sharp cliffs. What a place! You know, it almost looks like this is a painting. Someone took a painting of something.
100:20:40 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes.
100:20:46 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Hey, John, this is really a great speed at which to go over the ground, I'll tell you.

100:20:50 Young (onboard): Yeah man.
100:20:59 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Oh, here's one that tossed boulders out of it.
100:21:02 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): You've got it?
100:21:03 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yep. It tossed boulders right out of the stuff.
100:21:05 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Look at that mother.
100:21:06 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): See it? Right there. You can see it.
100:21:07 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Yes. Yes.
100:21:09 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): This little one right here tossed boulders right out of the son of a gun. Still a bunch in there.
100:21:53 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): OK. Neper's got to be coming up there pretty soon. We're at 36.
36 minutes to phasing burn ignition.
100:22:03 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): This is where G (G mission-Apollo 11) wants to do their altitude - run here.
100:22:11 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes. You could track. You can track here - no problems.
100:22:17 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): I just going to keep - but we're going so slow, I'm going to stay at 6 frames a second, Tom.
Cernan confirms he is leaving the 16-mm sequence camera running at 6 frames per second onto magazine G. This includes an approach towards landing site 2

100:22:24 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes. Oh man. Oh, beautiful. Hey, I could even see a boulder for at least 20 miles [37 km] ahead. In that one crater right on your left, Gene-o.
100:22:33 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Yes. Yes. Oh, look at one, way up. Let me take a look.
100:22:34 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Yes. It's got a big black one right down in the bottom of it.
100:22:39 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Yep. I can - you're right!
100:22:41 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Talk about a boulder! That thing is big enough to - to crush a couple of houses.
100:22:45 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): They're lying all down the side and there's no - there is no little rim crater on it, either. They're just lying on the side.
100:22:50 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Shoot a picture of that one - that white one coming up right. in front of you.
100:22:52 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): OK.
100:22:53 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): You can see...
100:22:54 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Here you go.
100:22:55 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): ...where the white ran down.
100:23:03 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): We got to be coming somewhere near where Neper is going to be up there, pretty soon, and the Smythe Sea.
100:23:15 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Tom, look at the boulder on the edge of that one. Quick, look over here - way over there. Look at that black one, way - See it? See it?
100:23:20 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Oh yes.
100:23:23 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Look at that! Look at that. I don't know why I'm fascinated with boulders, but son of a gun - those black things stand out. Give me the monocular on that one.
100:23:43 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): At first I thought it was shadow on it, but it sure isn't, because we're looking - coming down right through the...
100:23:57 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): OK. At 33:31, we're going to coming up on 269 and 192 and Jansky.
33 minutes, 31 seconds to phasing burn ignition.

100:24:13 Duke: Roger. Reading you five-by, Charlie Brown.
100:24:17 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): I need to get local vertical.
Stafford is reminding himself that prior to the Landing Radar test, he has to pitch the LM up, so that the +X axis nearly corresponds to the local vertical, so as to present the Landing Radar antenna to the lunar surface.

100:25:17 Duke: Roger. Great. Sounds great. We copy.
100:25:19 Young (onboard): ...It was a good burn, he's in a 61.2 by 9.2 [nautical miles, 113.3 x 17.0 km] right now...
100:25:26 Young: ...nominal burn. He'll fill you in when he gets to you. But...
LM Snoopy should now be passing over 100° east longitude, just east of Mare Smythii.
100:25:30 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Look at that - look at the Earth! Look at the Earth!
Very excited comments at seeing Earthrise.
100:25:33 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Oh gee. Look at the Earth, John. Get it, get it.
100:25:42 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Oh my God, I can't believe it! It's just...
100:25:43 Young: ...at 6 miles, he was doing 65 feet a second [20 m/s] on my - 6 miles [11 km] from me, he was doing 65 feet per second [20 m/s]. At 3.8 miles [7.0 km] he was doing 73 feet per second [22 m/s]. I think that confirms this burn. They are down there among the rocks...
100:25:47 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): That's beautiful.
100:25:48 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): And that color film didn't work! That makes me so mad!
100:25:52 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): John, we just had Earthrise. Fantastic. Golly, John! Tom, get that if you can.
The 16mm camera with magazine D is quickly swung around to capture Earthrise.

100:25:58 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): I don't have any color film on this son of a bitch.
Stafford in a very annoyed tone, is referring to the Hasselblad camera.
100:26:01 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Try it once more, maybe it'll work.
Cernan is encouraging Stafford to try again a color magazine which has been malfunctioning.
100:26:03 Young: ...mumbling about the boulders and things right now.
100:26:11 Duke: Roger. Charlie Brown.
100:26:14 Young: They just saw Earthrise. They say they are looking up, looking up at the horizon now.
100:26:22 Duke: Roger.
100:26:28 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): You're panning that, aren't you, Gene-o?
100:26:30 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Yes.
100:26:31 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Be sure to open it up for the Earth.
100:26:33 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): Open it up?
100:26:35 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Oh, yes. Earth on that color is f:11 at 250, babe.
100:26:38 Cernan (onboard Snoopy): You mean, wider?
100:26:39 Stafford (onboard Snoopy): Well, f:11 at 250 is the Earth. f:11 at 250.
100:26:51 Cernan (in Snoopy): Hello Houston. Houston this is Snoopy.
100:26:52 Duke: Roger, Snoop. Go ahead.
100:26:54 Cernan (in Snoopy): We is Go, and we is down among them, Charlie.
100:26:57 Duke: Roger. I hear you weaving your way up the freeway. Can you give me a post-burn report? Over.
100:27:10 Cernan (in Snoopy): Yes. As soon as I get my breath.
100:27:12 Stafford (in Snoopy): It doesn't work.
Stafford is conceding that the malfunctioning color magazine on the Hasselblad camera isn't going work.
100:27:14 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. Our residuals. Our burn was on time. Our residuals were minus 0.1, minus 0.3 and minus 0.5. And that was the residuals for the DPS burn. We did not use the - We did not null anything out. We are at 61.2 by 9.2 [nautical miles, 113.3 x 17.0 km] and the AGS has at an 8.6.
DOI burn residual values are given in Roll, Pitch and Yaw in fps
100:27:36 Duke: Roger, Snoopy. We copy all the residuals, and it looks like we are all Go. Your DPS is looking good, and it's Go. Over.
100:27:46 Cernan (in Snoopy): Oh. Charlie. We just saw Earthrise and it's got to be magnificent.
100:27:50 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yeah, you can also tell Jack Schmitt...
100:27:52 Duke: Roger. We copy.
100:27:53 Stafford (in Snoopy): ...that there are enough boulders around here to fill up Galveston Bay, too.
Stafford is referring to scientist astronaut Harrison (Jack) Schmitt. Schmitt was heavily involved in the geological training of the astronaut crews, and would eventually be the LMP on Apollo 17 in December 1972.
100:28:00 Duke: He's copying, Tom.
100:28:09 Cernan (in Snoopy): The only trouble is - We're stripping lots of film for him. The spacecraft is looking good and there are no problems, Charlie, except it would be nice to be around here more often.
100:28:21 Duke: Roger. We copy. All your systems are looking good to us. Did you get your DPS pressure back? Over.
100:28:26 Stafford (in Snoopy): Negative.
100:28:27 Cernan (in Snoopy): That's a negative, but the DPS burn was smoothed out very smooth, well when we throttled up.
100:28:36 Duke: Roger. We got a good - good pressures here and the DPS is Go for phasing.
100:28:42 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger, Charlie.
100:28:44 Cernan (in Snoopy): Can you image, no color film in that thing? Huh? Yes. I ought to hit someone over the head with that -
100:28:54 Stafford (in Snoopy): Oops. OK. Landing Radar Test coming up.
100:28:58 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. At 28 - not yet, babe.
28 minutes to phasing burn ignition.
100:29:03 Stafford (in Snoopy): Well, I want to get it early.
100:29:16 Stafford (in Snoopy): I need - Have you got them locked on? I need a Verb 83.
100:29:20 Cernan (in Snoopy): Verb 83?
100:29:21 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. Go call P00 and then get us a Verb 83.
See notes at 100:07:12
100:29:30 Cernan (in Snoopy): Let me run through - through 30 real quick.
Cernan wants to confirm the configuration of P30 in preparation for the upcoming Phasing DPS burn.
100:29:36 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK.
100:29:49 Duke: Snoop, Houston. There will be no update on the phasing PAD. Everything is looking really good.
100:29:57 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK. Good. We'll be picking up our landing radar test and taking pictures here and it is a fantastic sight. You do have different shades, of browns and grays here. And right - the volcanism there is also a pure white near the edge, and the bottom is black, and we see some large boulders that are black to blackish gray.
Snoopy is over the Smyth's Sea area now.
100:30:24 Duke: Roger, Snoopy. We copy.
100:30:30 Stafford (in Snoopy): Have we got it? What time?
100:30:32 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, just wanted to check it. Go ahead.
100:30:37 Stafford (in Snoopy): 27 50, Proceed.
27 minutes, 50 seconds to phasing burn ignition.
100:30:38 Cernan (in Snoopy): Call your Verb 83.
100:31:11 Cernan (in Snoopy): There you are, Tom.
100:31:14 Stafford (in Snoopy): Here are some more boulders.
100:31:24 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. We've got 10 minutes to go before we get to Taruntius G and H.
100:31:26 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK.
100:31:29 Stafford (in Snoopy): What's our elevation now?
100:31:36 Duke: Charlie Brown, Houston. Can you see them down there among the boulders? Over.
100:31:45 Young: I saw them about 14 miles [26 km]. But then I turned this thing over to CMC to let it do an Auto maneuver and it lost them.
100:31:53 Duke: Roger.
100:31:58 Young: I was tracking them just manually. I don't see them anymore. I'm going to let it update it with a little radar - a little range, and see if that brings it in.
100:32:05 Young: Houston. This is Charlie Brown. Omni D. How do you read?
100:32:10 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, go into Hover.
The LM Landing Radar antenna can operate in two positions, position 1, descent or position 2 Hover. Cernan is prompting the LR to go into the Hover position so that it can lock it's signal on to the lunar surface, 40,000 feet + (12,000 meters +) below.
Diagram of the Landing Radar, showing the two positions of the antenna.
100:32:11 Duke: Roger, Charlie Brown. We copy. Out.
100:32:12 Cernan (in Snoopy): Are you in Hover, Tom?
As the landing radar has not yet locked on to the lunar surface, it has not transitioned yet from the Descent to the Hover antenna position.
100:32:13 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK, going to Hover.
100:32:14 Cernan (in Snoopy): A little early, but let's get it in.
100:32:17 Duke: Charlie Brown. Houston. Go ahead.
100:32:28 Cernan (in Snoopy): You got it?
100:32:29 Stafford (in Snoopy): Should be reading about 42,000 feet [12,600 meters] when she actually locks on.
100:32:33 Cernan (in Snoopy): There it is. babe - Oh. beautiful. How's it look?
100:32:35 Stafford (in Snoopy): A quarter of a degree down.
100:32:36 Cernan (in Snoopy): Why don't you just write it on there?
100:32:37 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hello, Houston, This is Snoop. It looks like this landing radar is doing real good.
100:32:41 Duke: Roger, Snoop, we Roger that. Over.
100:32:52 Stafford (in Snoopy): It looks to me we want to have a lock-on here, [garble] even early.
100:33:04 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, babe. Coming on at 25 minutes...
Approximately 25 minutes until the phasing burn ignition.
101:33:06 Stafford (in Snoopy): Go - go back to P00.
100:33:12 Stafford (in Snoopy): And straight up ahead, you can see the gulf from the highlands over to the maria area. It's a beautiful sight. Just like you're crossing over to a black and gray sea.
100:33:21 Cernan (in Snoopy): There goes the landing radar.
100:33:26 Stafford (in Snoopy): Landing radar looks like it's locked on solid.
The landing radar antenna now has a lock-on to the lunar surface.
Beam acquisition occurred at 100:32:22, and the beams acquired tracker lock within 2 seconds of each other. Slant range at acquisition was about 75,500 feet (23,000 meters), which corresponds to a true altitude above the surface of nearly 71,000 feet (21,650 meters). Radar lock was maintained until an S-band communications problem caused loss of continuous downlink data at 100:36:32. Sporadic data points were obtained until 100:41:43; at that time, the radar indicated a slant range of 50,460 feet (15,400 meters), equivalent to a true altitude of 47,400 feet (14,450 meters), or less than 8 miles (15 km) above the local surface.

100:33:33 Duke: Roger, Snoop. Over.
100:33:36 Cernan (in Snoopy): I don't believe this thing's failed, do you?
100:33:39 Stafford (in Snoopy): You out of film?
100:33:47 Stafford (in Snoopy): What did that circuit breaker blew.
100:33:50 Cernan (in Snoopy): You've got to be kidding.

23 minutes until the phasing burn ignition. Cernan is bringing the ascent stage batteries online, so that they can be monitored prior to the phasing burn maneuver, and available to power the spacecraft should an abort be necessary and the LM has to stage.
100:34:48 Stafford (in Snoopy): Oh, yeah, yeah, baby.
100:34:49 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK.
100:34:55 Cernan (in Snoopy): Houston. I got the ascent batteries connected at this time.
100:35:02 Duke: Roger. We see that. Thanks, Snoop. Over.
Snoopy.
100:35:05 Cernan (in Snoopy): I didn't realize there were so many things to do in such a short time.
100:35:08 Cernan (in Snoopy): Give me that thing, Tom, if you can?
100:35:11 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK.

100:35:26 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger.
100:35:30 Cernan (in Snoopy): Charlie, we're now about where the horizon is - almost, you know, level - at times seems a little bit high. We're coming into - to a mare area 22 minutes before, before phasing right now. The craters, the new craters, seem to throw out very, very light, light, almost whitish gray by comparison to the dirtier-color whites and grays and browns. Right over the rim - there appears to be almost every fresh crater, there's visible boulders both down in it, on the sides and on the rim.
100:36:07 Stafford (in Snoopy): Also, Charlie, it looks like we're getting so close all you have to do is put your tail hook down and we're there. (Laughter)
100:36:21 Duke: Hey, Snoop. Air Force guys don't talk that way.
100:36:28 Stafford (in Snoopy): Well, I did fly an F4 that had one on it one time, even though it's an Air Force bird. OK. We're coming right over to the maria. And it really smooth out here, comparatively speaking.
100:36:37 Cernan (in Snoopy): You should be starting to see Langrenus over there, T.P.
100:36:39 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes.

100:36:49 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger.
100:36:50 Young: OK, Houston. I've got them in the optics now. They're fantastic.
100:36:56 Duke: Hey! Great show, Charlie Brown.
100:37:05 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. We're at - I don't believe we're quite up to Taruntius yet. We're in - we're in the Foaming Sea - We're past the Sea of Waves and in the Foaming Sea. And the maria gets markedly smooth and flat. There's small craters - a lot of small craters down in it, but the basic surface is extremely smooth. And it appears that the craters go down into it, rather than - than the rims come up out of it.
Foaming Sea-Mare Spumans, Sea of Waves-Mare Undarum.
100:37:30 Stafford (in Snoopy): You can tell that this area is definitely lower than that highland area, just as the whole general area.
Several of the features along the orbital ground track were given unofficial names by the Apollo 8, 10 & 11 crews. On this chart official IAU names are shown in white and the crew unofficial names in yellow.
100:37:35 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. I think right over the horizon, we've probably got Taruntius H and Taruntius G coming up. See them, Tom?
100:37:41 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes, we've got them, Cernan...

100:37:53 Cernan (in Snoopy): Yes. When you look straight down, there's a definite three-dimensional effect where you can't really tell the depth of craters like we could in the past. And in some cases, you're not even sure whether - whether there is depth to them except that they look a little familiar. It's a little bit hazier and glarier. It looks like we're right over a sub-solar point about now.
The crews comments in the mission report indicate that the surface washout phenomenon was much less pronounced than had been expected.
100:38:31 Young: Boy! Are they down there among them!
100:38:34 Duke: Roger. Bet it looks like they're really hauling the mail.
100:38:36 Stafford (in Snoopy): What - what did you do?
100:38:37 Cernan (in Snoopy): Huh? I didn't do anything.
100:38:38 Stafford (in Snoopy): Oh, sorry.
100:38:39 Cernan (in Snoopy): Yes. We're doing it. Surprisingly enough, Charlie, it really doesn't look like we're moving too fast down here. It's a very nice pleasant pace.
100:38:50 Duke: Roger.
100:38:49 Stafford (in Snoopy): In fact, it's exactly like when - tell Deke it's like you went out and practiced the other morning in Florida, as far as the relative bearing rate, it's about the same.
A few days before the launch, Tom Stafford and Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton, flew a T-38 jet over Florida for to simulate the angular bearing rate they would experience during the low LM pass.
100:39:03 Duke: Copy. Out.
100:39:04 Cernan (in Snoopy): Seems like we're coming up on my side on Taruntius G and I believe Tom's got his Taruntius H right there on his side. These come out of the horizon differently. They seem to come over the horizon and be much closer to you down here, than up there at 60 miles [111 km].
100:39:19 Stafford (in Snoopy): Shit, look at the boulders.
100:39:22 Cernan (in Snoopy): And, again the craters in this area, are craters that are dug out of the surface and not craters that are throwing back from the surface. They're very low, flat rims.
100:39:44 Duke: Snoop, you're dropping out. Your voice faded out. We're standing by.
Pericynthion time: 100 hours, 43 minutes, 20 seconds.
100:39:56 Cernan (in Snoopy): Roger. It looks like we might be on the verge of [garble] loss of lock, here; I don't know.
The problems being encountered with the S-band steerable antenna, are due to the antenna not tracking the Earth. The antenna is in a fixed position. As the LM changes attitude the signal strength is gradually dropping. The antenna was in a fixed position due to the antenna track-mode switch on panel 12, being moved from the Slew to Off position, rather than being placed in the Auto position.
100:40:05 Cernan (in Snoopy): Tom, I think you've either got Messier B or Secchi up there on your left in front of you. See it?
AS10-29-4256 taken by Stafford from the LM looking SW showing Messier and Messier B.
100:40:11 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yep.
100:40:23 Duke: Hello, Snoopy. If you read, Houston, we think your aerial is not tracking us too closely. Could you pick us up on the signal strength? Over.
100:40:36 Stafford (in Snoopy): Houston, Snoopy. From this altitude, the maria still looks fairly smooth as far as overall approach characteristics coming into it.
100:40:44 Young: Snoopy, Houston said something about their signal strength or something.
100:40:48 Cernan (in Snoopy): Tell them again - tell me again what you want them to do there, Houston.
100:40:54 Duke: Roger, Snoop. We're getting data dropout. It sounds like [garble].
100:40:55 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. We're coming into Apollo Ridge.
AS10-29-4263, taken by Stafford from the LM, looking west, showing Apollo Ridge and other features on the approach to landing site 2.
100:40:58 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes.
100:40:59 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. There's Secchi on my right.
100:41:04 Duke: Roger. We copy Apollo Ridge.
Apollo Ridge at 42 degree east longitude.
100:41:04 Cernan (in Snoopy): There's Secchi on my right! OK, Houston. Houston, if you read, we have Secchi on my right. We're coming into Apollo Ridge. There's the first of the - here's Apollo Rille, right out the window! Very, very easily distinguishable at this point, and it appears to be a couple of hundred feet deep.
100:41:22 Stafford (in Snoopy): It's rounded.
100:41:44 Duke: Hello, Snoop. Houston. Do you read? Can you try to tweak up the high-gain signal strength? Over.
100:41:44 Cernan (in Snoopy): Houston, I'm on Omni. I'm not sure whether you're reading, but we're coming over the Apollo Ridge. I just had Secchi on my right - Apollo Ridge appears to be a couple of hundred feet deep, but very smooth at the bottom. We should have the Smokey Basin right out of Tom's window, on the left.
100:42:02 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yep.
100:42:06 Cernan (in Snoopy): Are you reading, Houston?
100:42:21 Cernan (in Snoopy): Hello, John. Are you reading?
100:42:26 Young: Loud and clear there, Gene-o.
100:42:24 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. I'm on Omni, and we got good signal strength. I don't know whether they're listening, but we're over Apollo Ridge and we're just passing Smokey Basin.
100:42:33 Duke: Charlie Brown, Houston. If you read, have Snoopy tweak up the high gain. We're not reading him at all. Over.
100:42:40 Young: Roger.
100:42:42 Young: Charlie - Snoopy, Houston wants you to tweak up the high gain. They are not reading you.
100:42:50 Stafford (in Snoopy): We're coming into perilune now.
100:43:05 Young: Snoop, this is Charlie Brown. Over.
100:43:07 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, they should have it now. OK. We just passed Mount Marilyn. We're losing high-gain lock. We can't hold them.
100:43:17 Young: Houston, Snoopy said they can't hold you on the high gain.
100:43:24 Duke: Roger. Stand by.
100:43:25 Stafford (in Snoopy): Boulders all over the place. OK, You got it?
100:43:35 Cernan (in Snoopy): Houston, we're on Omni and we just passed Mount Marilyn. As a matter of fact, there's Weatherford Crater, I believe, right in here.
Weatherford crater is named after Tom Stafford's home town in Oklahoma.
100:43:42 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. Where we ought...
100:43:43 Cernan (in Snoopy): What's the time, babe? We're at 14:40. OK. And here - we just...
14 minutes and 40 seconds until the phasing burn ignition.
100:43:54 Cernan (in Snoopy): ...there's Teresa Ridge - Right there! We're right over it!
Cernan is referring to St. Teresa Ridge.
100:43:58 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, T.P. We're coming up on the Bear Mountain. It's right ahead of us. And you should have Maskelyne A. Do you have a big crater, Maskelyne A, right there, right on the edge of our - right in front of you, down straight in front of you on the left?
100:44:13 Stafford (in Snoopy): Could they have...
100:44:14 Cernan (in Snoopy): We have Lonesome Mesa right here.
100:44:19 Stafford (in Snoopy): Is this Maskelyne A?
100:44:21 Cernan (in Snoopy): Houston, I don't know whether you read or not, but that's the best we can do.
100:44:24 Duke: Snoop, we read you. Standing by.
100:44:26 Young: They are still transmitting to you, Houston - but - they're reading you, Snoopy, and they're standing by.
100:44:37 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. We're abeam of - we're abeam of Site 1. Tom, give me that a minute. let me see if I can take a couple of pictures.
100:44:47 Stafford (in Snoopy): And I've got Censorinus A out here. Hey, let me - I've got Censorinus A, right here, bigger than shit.
100:44:57 Cernan (in Snoopy): Hey, I tell you, we are low! We are close, babe! This is, like, it! And it really looks pretty smooth down there, surprisingly enough.
100:45:03 Stafford (in Snoopy): Censorinus A has huge boulders all around the rim of it, falling on the inside and outside.
AS10-29-4291 taken by Stafford from the LM, looking south, showing Censorinus and Censorinus A.
100:45:05 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. I've got Maskelyne out here off my right side. We are coming up on Boot Hill which is very easy to distinguish, and Maskelyne. And I see the craters that are going to lead us right into the - right into the landing site.
AS10-29-4296 taken by Cernan from the LM, looking north, showing Maskelyne.
100:45:17 Cernan (in Snoopy): We've got Duke Island on the left, just past Boot Hill and we are coming up - I've got Wash Basin just off my right arm - very easily distinguishable.
100:45:33 Cernan (in Snoopy): Tom, ought to have Sidewinder Rille coming up on the left - Tom, give me that...
AS10-29-4299 taken by Stafford from the LM, looking west, showing Sidewinder Rille and in the distance Moltke.
100:45:36 Stafford (in Snoopy): Here it comes.
100:45:37 Cernan (in Snoopy): ...get Maskelyne.
100:45:41 Stafford (in Snoopy): What time did we pitch over, 11:40?
100:45:43 Cernan (in Snoopy): Yeah.
100:45:56 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. I've got Diamondback. Diamondback Rille is very easy to see. These rilles look like they may be as much as a couple of hundred feet deep and very smooth. The surface actually looks very smooth, like a very wet clay, but smooth with the exception of the bigger craters.
100:45:15 Cernan (in Snoopy): Oh, Tom, let me get a picture of those rilles! Diamondback.
100:46:18 Stafford (in Snoopy): Here. Sidewinder Rille is round along the edges. It is flat under, and smooth in the bottom. The ridges are definitely rounded, and it doesn't look like the sides are upturned. OK. I've got Moltke up here on the left and we are coming into the site.
100:46:39 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. The best description I can give you of these rilles is of a dry - a dry riverbed out in New Mexico or Arizona someplace.
100:46:49 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hold it, go VOX. OK. Here we are coming up on the site [garble] Moltke on the left.
100:46:55 Cernan (in Snoopy): [Garble] Maskelyne G [garble].
100:46:57 Stafford (in Snoopy): ...there's plenty of holes there, but there are a few smooth places.
100:47:09 Cernan (in Snoopy): There's Sabine. OK. We just went over crater number 12, we've got the landing site, Tom's got Moltke right out his left - right. Take a picture of that, babe.
AS10-29-4324 taken by Stafford from the LM, looking south, showing Moltke and US1.
100:47:34 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK.
100:47:35 Cernan (in Snoopy): ... almost like you could reach out and touch Moltke, and we're going just right over the landing site right this moment, and it's - a lot of - a lot of rounded-off craters, a few fresh ones, but basically, it looks pretty smooth, like a gummy grayish sand.
100:47:51 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK. My camera failed, I took so many pictures. There's still lots of small craters down there, but I'd say you have about 30 percent of the area that looks free. About 30 per cent. So if you've got Hover time, you can probably make it.
100:47:55 Duke: Snoop, Houston, Request Downvoice Backup. Over.
100:47:57 Young: Snoopy, Houston wants you to go to Downvoice Backup. Over.
100:48:03 Cernan (in Snoopy): ...I am, John, I'm in Downvoice Backup.
100:48:12: Young: That's where he is, He's in Downvoice Backup.
100:48:13 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK.
100:48:14 Cernan (in Snoopy): We're just going over the landing site right now, and we should be coming up on Ritter - Sabine and Ritter and then Schmitt.

100:48:25 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK, here is US 1. US 1 has got a rounded side, and it looks like the whole thing is slumped down an even amount, like it is a huge graben.
A graben is an area of surface that has dropped between two parallel faults.
100:48:33 Cernan (in Snoopy): Man, that must be - Tom, that must be seven, that must be a thousand feet wide.
100:48:39 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. US 1 is a good - oh, almost a good mile - a thousand feet to a mile wide - even a couple thousand feet to a mile wide. And the whole thing is slumped down. And the plain is still pretty pock-marked with craters, but it looks like you could be able to set down there.
100:48:56 Stafford (in Snoopy): We're going to phasing attitude.
100:48:58 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK.
100:49:04 Young: OK.
100:49:05 Cernan (in Snoopy): Goddamn film pack failed. I'm so fed up with this stuff failing.
16mm sequence camera film pack has failed.
100:49:10 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hey. Gene-o, what's the phasing attitude?
The attitude for the phasing manoeuvre as given in the PAD are, roll 000°, pitch 255° as displayed on the FDAI eight ball when it is in the Inertial mode.
100:49:11 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK.
100:49:11 Duke: Charlie Brown, Houston. Over.
100:49:13 Young: Go ahead. Over.
100:49:15 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. Let me...
100:49:18 Duke: Roger. We had a complete data dropout with Snoopy...
100:49:18 Young: ...I read you loud and clear.
100:49:22 Duke: OK. Roger. Pass it on: we got 9 minutes till burn; get in the attitude; and they're Go for phasing. Over.
The DPS phasing burn puts the LM in a 'dwell' orbit which allows the CSM to overtake and pass the LM so that when the LM passes over landing site 2 on orbit 13, the LM will be trailing the CSM by approximately 27 nautical miles (50 km). It will then be in the proper relative position for the LM insertion manoeuvre to simulate the ascent from the lunar surface during a landing mission.
100:49:24 Cernan (in Snoopy): I'm starting this right now, Tom.
100:49:32 Young: Roger. Snoopy, Houston says you're Go for phasing. Got about 8½ minutes now. Want to get you in the attitude.
100:49:48 Young: Snoop, Charlie Brown. Do you read?
100:49:56 Stafford (in Snoopy): Oh, look at this!
100:49:57 Cernan (in Snoopy): You know this god-damned film pack failed on me?
100:49:58 Stafford (in Snoopy): My Hasselblad just failed!

100:50:05 Cernan (in Snoopy): Oh, I tell you, babe, that's something. OK.
100:50:07 Stafford (in Snoopy): Oh! Look at that!
100:50:10 Cernan (in Snoopy): Except I don't have any more [garble].
100:50:13 Stafford (in Snoopy): What happened to my control systems?
100:50:16 Cernan (in Snoopy): I don't know. Why?
100:50:19 Duke: Snoop, Houston. We're reading you about three-by now...
100:50:21 Young: ...I just got a VHF [garble].
100:50:22 Duke: We're counting 8 minutes to the burn. Over.
100:50:27 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger. We're going to phasing attitude.
100:50:32 Duke: Roger. And you're Go for the burn.
100:50:34 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes, You can't imagine the position we can see these things in, pitched way down like this. It looks like we're not very far above them. It's fantastic.
The LM has manoeuvred to the phasing attitude which has the crew facing down at the lunar surface, traveling heads first, ready for the posigrade phasing DPS burn.
100:50:47 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, babe. You might try and get your helmets and gloves on. I went through P30, and we're all good there again.
100:51:21 Cernan (in Snoopy): What is your attitude, babe? Boy, it's getting dark. OK, I thought we were pointing up in the air.
100:51:26 Stafford (in Snoopy): Let's hurry up and get this burn completed.
100:51:42 Stafford (in Snoopy): Son of a bitch.
Stafford is having problems donning his helmet.
100:51:56 Cernan (in Snoopy): We has been down among them, babe!
100:52:07 Stafford (in Snoopy): We got to start doing that earlier.
Stafford feels they should have donned their helmet and gloves earlier.
100:52:07 Cernan (in Snoopy): Tom, are you reading me?
100:52:09 Stafford (in Snoopy): I'm reading you. Do you read me?
100:52:10 Cernan (in Snoopy): Yeah.
100:52:13 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK. Help -
100:52:15 Young: OK, you guys. Give it to them.
100:52:19 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. You can go into 40.
The crew are preparing P40 to control the PNGS during the countdown to and performance of the Phasing DPS burn.
100:52:20 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK.
100:52:34 Stafford (in Snoopy): It's OK. Verb 06, Noun - minus 16710 and minus...
As part of P40, the LGC displays Verb 06 Noun 40 on the DSKY. The display registers show the LGC calculated parameters:
R1 - TIG, time from DPS ignition, in minutes and seconds, to the nearest second, XX XX.
R2 - VG, the magnitude of the velocity to be gained in the thrusting manoeuvre, displayed in feet per second, to the nearest 0.1 fps.
R3 - Delta-VM, the measured Delta-V magnitude, in feet per second, to the nearest 0.1 fps.
The values displayed on R3 will be shown at this time as 00000, and should not change until the ullage burn.
100:52:34 Young: Houston, Charlie Brown. They're going into a P40 now.
100:52:37 Duke: Roger. We copy them, Charlie Brown. Thanks so much.
100:52:44 Young: Roger.
100:52:45 Cernan (in Snoopy): Plus 16710.
100:52:46 Stafford (in Snoopy): Plus 167.10...
100:52:48 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. [Garble].
100:52:49 Stafford (in Snoopy): ...minus 58.0.
100:52:50 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK.
100:52:55 Stafford (in Snoopy): Proceed. Yes. We'll do an Auto maneuver.
100:53:01 Cernan (in Snoopy): Verb 70 - OK, you should have called a Verb 78 in there, babe.
Verb 78 is used to start Routine 77 which is used to readout the Range and Delta-V data from the Landing Radar.
100:53:02 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK.
100:53:43 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK. Four minute check...
100:53:45 Cernan (in Snoopy): And, Tom, the AGS is good for a takeover. The AGS is good for a takeover.
100:53:54 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK.
100:53:55 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. Let me open and close this breaker.
100:54:04 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK.
100:54:10 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK T.P. We've got to get something out of this burn. Engine Gimbal, Enable.
100:54:11 Stafford (in Snoopy): Engine Gimbal Enable.
100:54:12 Stafford (in Snoopy): Throttle Min.
100:54:10 Stafford (in Snoopy): Throttle's coming to Min.
100:54:12 Cernan (in Snoopy): Throttle Control, Auto.
100:54:16 Stafford (in Snoopy): Throttle Control is Auto.
100:54:18 Cernan (in Snoopy): Manual Throttle, Commander.
100:54:19 Stafford (in Snoopy): Go.
100:54:21 Cernan (in Snoopy): Balance Couple, On.
100:54:22 Stafford (in Snoopy): Go.
100:54:25 Cernan (in Snoopy): Descent Engine Override Command, Off.
100:54:27 Stafford (in Snoopy): Go.
100:54:29 Cernan (in Snoopy): Engine pushbuttons all Reset?
100:54:31 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yep.
100:54:34 Cernan (in Snoopy): Abort pushbuttons all Reset.
100:54:36 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK
100:54:37 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, Stab/Control: DECA Power, Closed; and AELD Closed.
100:54:42 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK. Stab/Control: DECA Power Closed and AELD Closed.
100:54:46 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. EPS Inverter number 2 Closed.
100:54:49 Stafford (in Snoopy): That's over there.
100:54:51 Cernan (in Snoopy): No, it isn't!
100:54:52 Stafford (in Snoopy): EPS Inverter number 2?
100:54:53 Cernan (in Snoopy): EPS Inverter number 1 Closed; I'm sorry. You got it?
100:54:55 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK.
100:54:56 Cernan (in Snoopy): You got it?
100:54:57 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes.
In case an abort and staging are required during the Phasing manoeuvre, the Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS) Inverter No 1 circuit breaker is closed so that by depressing the Abort Stage pushbutton on panel 1, will initiate a switchover from descent stage DC power to ascent stage AC power, prior to the physical separation of the stages.
100:54:58 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. Descent Engine Override coming Closed? AELD coming Closed. Abort Stage coming Closed.
100:55:11 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, Tom, if Delta-V to go is less than five (fps) (1.5 m/s), we'll RCS it to zero, 3 Max. If Delta-V to go is less than 25 (fps) (7.6 m/s) but greater than 5 (fps) (1.5 m/s), we've got to stage in RCS to zero.
Cernan is reading out the various off-nominal options if the Phasing DPS burn is not completed as planned, as specified in the Apollo 10 mission rules.
100:55:23 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes.
100:55:24 Cernan (in Snoopy): If Delta-V to go is greater than 25 (fps) (7.6 m/s) we got to stage and APS to zero. OK?
100:55:28 Stafford (in Snoopy): Right.
100:55:29 Cernan (in Snoopy): Now if we have to go to AGS, or APS, I've got the staging procedures and everything right here.
100:55:37 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yep.
100:55:38 Cernan (in Snoopy): After - after burning - if we stage, we'll stage it and burn it in AGS and go.
100:55:39 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK.
100:55:40 Cernan (in Snoopy): If we burn the ascent engine, we'll burn it in AGS.
100:55:44 Stafford (in Snoopy): 2 minutes.
100:55:46 Cernan (in Snoopy): Have you got your landing radar on?
100:55:48 Stafford (in Snoopy): Landing radar is still on.
100:55:50 Cernan (in Snoopy): You got to pull that breaker.
100:55:51 Stafford (in Snoopy): No. It stays on until after this. We do a Verb 79 - afterwards.
100:55:58 Cernan (in Snoopy): Alright.
100:56:11 Stafford (in Snoopy): Two minutes.
100:56:33 Stafford (in Snoopy): From final Proceed. We're there. Enter.
100:56:42 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK, 1:46 to go. We have phasing of 176 feet per second (53.6 m/s). OK. 1:30, Gene-o.
100:57:10 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, babe, 1:14 to go.
100:57:13 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yep
100:57:20 Stafford (in Snoopy): John, we'll go on VOX, so you can read it.
100:57:30 Cernan (in Snoopy): John, how do you read?
100:57:31 Young: Loud and clear.
100:57:33 Cernan (in Snoopy): We are being cut out, but I assume it's loud and clear.
100:57:38 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, Tom. Coming up on 35 seconds: Engine Arm Descent? Deadband Min. You are in AGS. A-OK. Go to Auto on the AGS. There's your AGS needle. AGS attitude's is looking good.
100:57:50 Stafford (in Snoopy): DSKY blanks; hit the Proceed at 5 seconds.
At DPS ignition minus 35 seconds the DSKY, Verb, Noun and all three register displays go blank for 5 seconds to indicate to the crew the PNGS was ready to ignite the DPS engine as specified.
100:57:55 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. Babe, the AGS is looking good, there is your AGS attitude...
100:57:58 Stafford (in Snoopy): We'll trim the...
100:57:59 Cernan (in Snoopy): You're in good shape.
100:58:03 Stafford (in Snoopy): Standing by to start it.
100:58:04 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, and I'll trim out the burn.
100:58:05 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK, here we go for 26 seconds.
100:58:09 Cernan (in Snoopy): The total burn time is ...
100:58:11 Stafford (in Snoopy): 40.
100:58:12 Cernan (in Snoopy): 40 seconds.
100:58:13 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK, stand by to proceed.
100:58:14 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. I'm ready.
100:58:15 Stafford (in Snoopy): ... ullage.
100:58:20 Cernan (in Snoopy): Flashing 99.
5 seconds prior to the programmed DPS ignition time, a flashing 99 is displayed on the DSKY. This is a prompt for the crew to confirm to the LGC that they wish to continue with the burn. By pressing the Proceed key on the DSKY, the crew gives the LGC the instruction to commence the burn.
100:58:21 Stafford (in Snoopy): Proceed.
100:58:22 Cernan (in Snoopy): 99, Proceed. There's ullage.
Planned spacecraft attitude from Phasing to Insertion.
100:58:26 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK, throttle's up. That's OK. Let it go. We're burning. OK.
100:58:34 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. We're burning, John; we're burning!
100:58:37 Stafford (in Snoopy): Go to throttle up.
100:58:41 Duke: Snoop, Houston. We copy.
100:58:41 Cernan (in Snoopy): It's the Gimbal light. Forget about it, babe. We've got an Engine Gimbal light, but everything is good.
The DPS engine uses gimbal drive actuators to trim the engine to ensure the thrust vector is acting through the LM's centre of mass and to assist in controlling the LM attitude.
A master alarm and associated DPS engine pitch gimbal fail warning light were displayed during the phasing burn, when the DPS pitch gimbal actuator began 'coasting'. Coasting is a uncommanded gimbal movement, which occurs when the spring brake mechanism fails to engage following the removal of drive signals.
LM telemetry data indicate that the pitch and roll actuators both drove as expected. The small number of thruster firings also demonstrate that thrust vector control was maintained using the actuators. During the manoeuvre, the gimbal fail was indicated at the time of a reversal in pitch gimbal motion. Coasting is not detrimental to the gimbal actuators operation.
The Master Alarm warning light / push button is situated on panels 1 & 2 in front of both crewmen. The ENG GMBL caution and warning light is situated at the top of panel 2.

100:58:47 Stafford (in Snoopy): We're still burning.
100:58:48 Cernan (in Snoopy): Still burning, 149 (fps) (45.4 m/s) to go.
100:58:50 Stafford (in Snoopy): 26. Ohhh.
During the phasing burn, the DPS throttle at ignition is set at 13.1% for the first 26 seconds, then the throttle is advanced to 100% for the remaining ~17 seconds until the DPS cut-off.
100:58:51 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. Throttling up. 127 (fps) (38.7 m/s) to go.
100:58:57 Stafford (in Snoopy): How's the attitudes?
100:58:58 Cernan (in Snoopy): 107 (fps) (32.6 m/s) to go.
100:58:59 Stafford (in Snoopy): Good.
100:59:00 Cernan (in Snoopy): 86 (fps, 26.2 m/s) to go. 40 (fps, 12 m/s) to go, 40 (fps), 20 (fps, 6 m/s) to go.
100:59:04 Stafford (in Snoopy): Oh, brother.
100:59:05 Cernan (in Snoopy): Shutdown!
100:59:10 Stafford (in Snoopy): DECA Power off.
100:59:11 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, Tom. 1.5 feet per second (0.45 m/s). Let me null it out. Let's go to AGS Attitude Hold.
100:59:15 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK. OK, we'll go to AGS...
100:59:19 Cernan (in Snoopy): AGS Attitude Hold.
Once the AGS Attitude Hold mode is selected, the crew can command angular attitude changes at rates that are proportional to the deflection of the ACA (Attitude Control Assembly).
100:59:21 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK. Go. Hold it. Something's wrong here.
100:59:29 Cernan (in Snoopy): We're Min Deadband. That's good. Let it go, right here. That's good.
100:59:31 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK good we're done. That's got it.
100:59:33 Cernan (in Snoopy): That's got it, babe.
100:59:34 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK.
100:59:38 Cernan (in Snoopy): Let me get those.
100:59:39 Stafford (in Snoopy): I'm going to Wide Deadband.
100:59:43 Cernan (in Snoopy): Plus two. minus point - plus 0.2, minus 0.5, and minus 0.9. The burn is good, John.
The residuals are the errors in each of the three axes, expressed in fps following the manoeuvre. Cernan using the LM RCS will correct these errors.

100:59:51 Young: Roger. I understand. The burn is good.
100:59:54 Duke: And Snoop, Houston. We copy your residuals. Over.
Flight Plan
100:59:59 Cernan (in Snoopy): Roger.
101:00:00 Stafford (in Snoopy): Looked real good and the burn was steady, we had the Descent Quantity light on twice, we had the Engine Gimbal light on, the Master Warning and all those good things, but we just pressed right on. Over.
At ignition of the DPS for the Phasing burn, the Master Alarm was illuminated and the tone sounded. It was drawing the crews attention to the illuminated DES QTY caution and warning light on panel 1.
The Master Alarm was immediately reset. The low level indication started at 23 minutes prior to the Phasing manoeuvre, as indicated by telemetry. It remained in this state from this time and through the Phasing DPS burn. The low level indication was probably caused by a gas bubble, which uncovered the low level sensor. This then caused the low level light to latch on, but not to illuminate until the DPS engine firing circuit was enabled at Phasing ignition. Hence only at ignition of the DPS, did the Master Alarm and DES QTY caution and warning lights appear. The low level sensor remains on even after the Master Alarm was reset. It will only go off if the PQGS (Propellant Quantity Gauging System) circuit breaker is cycled OFF and then back ON. However on this occasion the DES QTY C&W light did go out, which is contrary to the system design.
Descent Quantity caution and warning light - LM panel 1.
PQGS circuit breaker - LM panel 16.
101:00:08 Duke: Roger. We copy.
101:00:09 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. Verb 82, Enter.
101:00:17 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, Tommy. OK. Houston, we are in a 190.8 by 11.8 [nautical miles, 353.4 x 21.8 km].
101:00:25 Duke: Roger. We copy.
101:00:30 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, Tom. Verify your Engine Arm Off.
101:00:33 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes, Engine Arm, Off.
101:00:34 Cernan (in Snoopy): Prop Quantity, Off.
101:00:35 Stafford (in Snoopy): Prop Quantity coming Off.
101:00:38 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, babe. You can - Let me take my helmet and gloves off.
101:00:42 Stafford (in Snoopy): Let me get the DECA Gimbal open. Let's get a Verb 79.
Verb 79 terminates Routine 77 and is used to to read out the LR range and velocity data and put this data on the LGC downlink.
101:00:44 Cernan (in Snoopy): I got it.
101:00:46 Stafford (in Snoopy): And we'll get the Landing Radar.
101:00:49 Duke: Snoop, Houston. We missed the Verb 79.
101:00:53 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger. Just went in.
101:00:57 Duke: OK. We got it. Thanks, Tom.
MCC-H has now begun to receive the LR data via the telemetry downlink.
101:01:00 Stafford (in Snoopy): How's the pressure doing? Oh, I guess it's just does.
101:01:03 Duke: Hey, Snoop, Houston. The comm is really great and we got all our data now. During the good part though, boy you were way down in the mud, but everything is copacetic now. Over.
101:01:12 Cernan (in Snoopy): Charlie. I fought with the S-band antenna to get it for you, but it's the best I could do and I got the strongest strength Omni when we were down there. And then after we passed, I gave S-band another try and we came in good, because I thought you'd want to see the burn.
101:01:29 Duke: We appreciate it. Thanks much, Snoop. It looked great.
During the beginning of revolution 13, the S-band steerable antenna did not properly track. At Acquisition Of Signal, the received signal strength at the ground station indicated near-boresight condition for the antenna. Over the next 13 minutes, the signal strength gradually decreased 20 dB. A plot of expected signal strength below, considering spacecraft attitude changes and antenna gain patterns, showed that the antenna was not moving at this time. The antenna performed well both before and after this period.
The possible causes for failure of the antenna to move were either that the servo system circuit was open or the antenna track-mode switch was in the Slew or Off position.
The track-mode switch for the steerable antenna on panel 12, is a three-position switch (down - Slew; centre - Off; up - Auto). The crew reported that the switch may have inadvertently been switched to Off instead of to Auto at the time acquisition had been established.

At this time, Young is using P76 to update the CMC LM state vector following the Phasing manoeuvre.
101:01:32 Stafford (in Snoopy): And, Houston, this is Snoopy. You'd like to know that we have taken so many pictures that both cameras have failed on us. Over.
The 16-mm sequence camera had not actually failed, but Cernan continued to have problems getting the film cassette to engage properly.
101:01:42 Duke: Roger, we copy.
101:01:43 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, Tom, we want to do some tracking. You got your - you got this yaw maneuver, put your Rendezvous Radar breaker In.
101:01:49 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. OK. OK.
101:01:57 Cernan (in Snoopy): You got your Rendezvous breaker In?
101:01:58 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yep.
The Rendezvous Radar is powered up again.
101:02:00 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. And you got to - go to 120 upside down. And you're probably in - Oh, you're in inertial now, aren't you?
101:02:06 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes, that's where I want to be.
101:02:15 Cernan (in Snoopy): And here's where the AGS thinks it is Tom.
Cernan has requested the post burn LM attitude from the AGS.
101:02:23 Cernan (in Snoopy): The AGS needles - AGS needles give you a hack on where it is. Yaw 180 and pitch down 90, I know that. OK Tom. Clean up your breaker panel: PGNS Landing Radar Opened?
The LM now has to yaw 180° to present the RR antenna towards the CSM for P20 tracking.
Now that the landing radar test is complete, it is powered down, the PGNS Landing Radar on panel 11 is opened.
101:02:36 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yep.
101:02:37 Cernan (in Snoopy): Stab/Control: DECA Power open.
101:02:38 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yep.
101:02:39 Stafford (in Snoopy): AELD, Open?
101:02:40 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yep.
101:02:41 Cernan (in Snoopy): Inverter number 1 Open?
101:02:42 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yep.
101:02:43 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, my Descent Engine Override is coming Open. My AELD is coming Open. My Abort Stage is coming Open, and I am going to disconnect the batteries. Stand by. OK. That one's above?
101:02:59 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yep.
101:03:05 Cernan (in Snoopy): Pretty good bird, you know it?
101:03:05 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yeah.
101:03:06 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, how about RCS? What have we got quantity-wise? 92 and 82 (per cent in system A and B).
101:03:10 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes, we've been hosing it out. These - these needles aren't nulled. They get all that tracking down there and...
101:03:15 Cernan (in Snoopy): Fine, that's no problem, babe. Piece of cake. Waiting for - to get to that attitude and we'll pick up P20 and we'll start marking.
P20 is used to control the LM attitude and the Rendezvous Radar (RR) to acquire and track the CSM with the RR and update either the LM or CSM state vector on the basis of RR tracking data.
101:03:22 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes.
101:03:39 Cernan (in Snoopy): Looking at 120 upside down.
101:04:00 Duke: Charlie Brown, Houston. We have a backup insertion PAD if you are ready to copy. Over.
101:04:06 Young: Roger. Go ahead.
101:04:08 Duke: Roger, Charlie Brown.
101:04:10 Cernan (in Snoopy): ... manual
101:04:11 Young: Go ahead.
101:04:11 Stafford (in Snoopy): We're not near it there.
101:04:12 Duke: Roger, Charlie Brown, backup insertion: SPS, G&N: NA down to Noun 33, Noun 33 is 102:58:01.00, plus 0170.0, plus all balls, minus 0071.0, 180, 262, 002, NA down to Delta-VC, and the Delta-VC is 0171.8. Rest of the PAD is NA. Your ullage is four jets, 10 seconds. Got a CSI time: a 103:44:00, TPI time 105:33:00, with an N equal to 1. Over.
101:04:35 Stafford (in Snoopy): ...you didn't give me AGS.
101:04:37 Cernan (in Snoopy): I gave you AGS - AGS needles right here, Tom.
101:04:39 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. OK.
101:04:42 Stafford (in Snoopy): Good. Leave it there.
101:04:44 Cernan (in Snoopy): Where the AGS thinks it is.
101:04:48 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. Put it back there so I can...
101:04:49 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. As long as you don't go to Mode Control, you're alright. You can leave it in there.
101:04:51 Stafford (in Snoopy): Oh, yeah. Not about to.
101:05:26 Cernan (in Snoopy): That's exactly what we called for.
101:05:28 Stafford (in Snoopy): There he is.
101:05:29 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. See if you can get them...
101:05:32 Stafford (in Snoopy): I got him in the reflected.
101:05:34 Cernan (in Snoopy): Just get the signals. You got your Radar breakers in?
101:05:35 Young: Roger. SPS, G&N: not applicable down to time of burn: 102:58:01.00, plus 0170.0, plus all balls, minus 071.00, 180, 262, 002, Delta-VC 07 - 0171.8, four jets, 10 seconds. CSI: 103:44:00, TPI 105:33:00, N equals 1.
The above PAD is interpreted as follows:
Purpose: Backup insertion.
Systems: The burn will be made using the large SPS (Service Propulsion System) engine, under the control of the Guidance and Navigation system.
Time of ignition, TIG (Noun 33): 102:58:01.00
Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s): x, +170.0 (51.8); y, +000.0 (0.0); z, -71.0 (21.6)
Spacecraft attitude: Roll, 180°; Pitch 262°; Yaw 2°. The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform.
Delta-VC: 171.8 fps (52.4 m/s). This value is the change in velocity that MCC expect the EMS to sense.

101:05:36 Stafford (in Snoopy): I've got the AC.
101:05:51 Cernan (in Snoopy): See if you can get him.
Cernan is encouraging Stafford to try to acquire the CSM with the rendezvous radar.
101:06:03 Cernan (in Snoopy): Yes, it's on AGS on your ball, babe.
101:06:16 Cernan (in Snoopy): There it goes.
The LM rendezvous radar locks on to the CSM transponder.
101:06:17 Duke: Good readback, Charlie Brown.
101:06:30 Cernan (in Snoopy): As soon as you get him, go to LGC and we'll...
101:06:40 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK.
101:06:41 Duke: Charlie Brown, Houston. Confirm Delta-VC and Noun 81: minus 00710.
Duke wants confirmation of that Young has heard the Delta-VC, Z-axis element of the backup insertion PAD.
101:06:42 Cernan (in Snoopy): Here it comes.
101:06:52 Cernan (in Snoopy): Want to try and let P20 do it? Let's let P20 try it. Go to LGC.
101:06:58 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK. Hang on. This thing should be boresighted in.
101:07:01 Young: Minus two balls, 710.
101:07:02 Cernan (in Snoopy): It's close enough. Why don't you try and let P20 try it?
101:07:05 Duke: OK. Fine. You have been breaking up a little bit, John, we missed one of those zeros.
101:07:09 Stafford (in Snoopy): José, are you pitched up?
101:07:16 Young: That's affirm, I'll get there.
101:07:18 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yeah, he didn't pitch up far enough.
101:07:20 Young: I'm not pitched up; I'm in tracking attitude right now.
101:07:21 Cernan (in Snoopy): Why don't you go to LGC, and let him try it, babe? Go ahead.

101:07:45 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hey, John. Babe, you may have to go down and reset that rendezvous radar transponder. Over.
101:07:57 Cernan (in Snoopy): There it comes. Hold it, John. We're getting it.
101:08:00 Stafford (in Snoopy): (Coughing)
101:08:16 Cernan (in Snoopy): You alright?
101:08:17 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. I got some insulation.
Stafford is coughing, having problem with the Mylar insulation that was blown off the CM forward hatch when the docking tunnel was pressurized.
101:08:23 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, there's an update, babe. It's alright.
101:08:31 Stafford (in Snoopy): You want to try...
101:08:32 Cernan (in Snoopy): Holy smoley. Look at that.
101:08:35 Stafford (in Snoopy): Uh-oh..
101:08:36 Cernan (in Snoopy): Holy shit!
101:08:40 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hello, Houston. Snoopy.
101:08:45 Duke: Go ahead, Snoopy. Over.
101:08:47 Stafford (in Snoopy): Did you take a look at 06 49 and see what we got there?
Whilst running P20 to take navigation marks on the CSM using the rendezvous radar, the crew key Verb 06 Noun 49 on the DSKY to display the Delta-R (range), XXXX.X nm, and Delta-V (rate of closure), XXXX.X fps.
On each occasion, when the crew ran P20 to take rendezvous radar (RR) navigation marks, the initial LGC readout of range rate from the RR is displayed as a set of random and very large values. This readout is what Stafford is drawing to the attention of MCC-H. This erroneous readout resulted in the state vector update being loaded in to the LGC erasable memory (e-memory) exceeded the allowable limits. The flashing Verb 06 Noun 49 display these large values on the DSKY, and can be discarded and cleared from the DSKY by entering Verb 32 Enter. This causes the RR data Read routine to recycle and bring forth new values.
The large values initially displayed are the result of the RR output shift register, which is not rest to zero when it is powered up. The initial bit configuration is unpredictable, although due to the design of the register the output is predominantly a series of ones. This initial bit configuration is subsequently passed to the LGC as a range rate value, when the first readout command is sent from the LGC to the RR (Verb 06 Noun 49). Once this initial bit register has been passed to the LGC, the RR output register is cleared and repopulated by valid data from the radar. Therefore the initial radar data displayed on the DSKY give a valid range value but an invalid range rate value. All subsequent marks will be accurate.
A procedural change was made for Apollo 11 to alleviate this problem.
101:08:54 Duke: Roger. We're looking at it. Stand by.
101:08:56 Cernan (in Snoopy): The first one was a small number: 0.4 and zero.
101:09:02 Stafford (in Snoopy): Did we put it - no, not - don't let that son of a bitch update the vector. We've got a Verb 95 in it.
Whilst running P20, it is possible to use the acquired navigation data to update the LM state vector by keying Verb 80 Enter, update the CSM state vector by keying Verb 81 Enter, or to update neither in the LGC, key Verb 95 Enter.
101:09:06 Duke: Roger, copy. 0.4 and zero on the first. It looks like big numbers now.
101:09:12 Cernan (in Snoopy): It's updating his state vector anyway.
101:09:15 Duke: Snoop, Houston. While we're looking at this, would you - are you ready to copy an insertion PAD? Over.
101:09:21 Cernan (in Snoopy): That's affirmative. I am, and I'd also like to give - you give me an update on AOS and sunrise.
101:09:31 Duke: Roger. Stand by. Your insertion PAD: TIG, starting with TIG - 102:55:01.40, Minus 01832, plus all balls, minus 0123.5. Delta-VR is 02209, 015, minus - correction, roll is 180, 233, minus 01818, plus all balls, minus 01255, rest of the PAD is NA. Standing by for your readback. Over.
The details of this PAD are:
Purpose: APS Insertion burn.
Time of ignition, TIG (Noun 33): 102:55:01.40
Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s): X - 183.2 (55.8), Y +000.0 (0.0), Z -123.5 (37.6). The change in velocity is resolved into three components expressed relative to the 'Local Vertical' frame of reference.
Total required change in velocity, Delta-VR, fps (m/s): 220.9 (67.3)
Burn duration, BT (min:sec): 0:15
Attitude angles that should be displayed on the FDAI eight ball in the Inertial mode: Roll 180°, Pitch 233°
Change in velocity values used to target the AGS (Noun 86), fps (m/s): X -181.8 (55.4), Y -000.0 (0.0), Z -125.5 (38.3).
These velocities are expressed relative to the Local Vertical frame of reference.

101:10:56 Duke: Roger. Stand by. We want you to reject that mark with the big numbers, and stand by on the others.
101:12:06 Cernan (in Snoopy): No, not Verb 49, babe.
101:12:08 Duke: Snoop, Houston. We have LOS time for you of 101:37.
101:12:10 Stafford (in Snoopy): Oh.
101:12:11 Cernan (in Snoopy): God damn! I don't know what that did.
101:12:12 Stafford (in Snoopy): I'm sorry ...
Stafford has incorrectly enter Verb 49, rather than Noun 49 in to the DSKY, and Cernan is concerned what this error will do.
101:12:20 Duke: Sunrise time of 101:40. Over,
101:12:24 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. I got it. I don't know what - it'll be right here. It's right here.
101:12:30 Duke: And, how's the P20 doing now? Is it taking good Marks?
101:12:34 Stafford (in Snoopy): "Start crew defined maneuver". We don't have any. We don't have any...
Stafford has looked up in the onboard guidance and navigation dictionary, what Verb 49 relates to. Verb 49 is defined as 'Request Crew Defined Maneuver' routine (R62). As the crew are not about to perform any crew defined manoeuvres, this error has no impact.
101:12:36 Cernan (in Snoopy): Yes it looks like it is.
101:12:37 Stafford (in Snoopy): We're OK...
101:12:38 Cernan (in Snoopy): We just got our second. Mark and, wait a minute.
101:12:39 Stafford (in Snoopy): It doesn't mean a thing.
101:12:42 Cernan (in Snoopy): Yes. It looked good. It's three-tenths of a foot per second (0.1 m/s).
101:12:46 Stafford (in Snoopy): That's the Automaneuver. We're OK.
101:12:53 Cernan (in Snoopy): And I'll read the PAD back if you'd like.
101:13:07 Cernan (in Snoopy): Houston, are you ready for the PAD?
101:13:10 Duke: Roger. Go.
101:13:11 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. Insertion is 102:55:01.40, minus 01832, plus all balls, minus 01235. 02209, 015, 180, 233, minus 01818, plus all balls, minus 01255 and that's it.
101:13:38 Duke: Roger. That was a good readback.
101:13:46 Stafford (in Snoopy): I want to do some Z-axis tracking.
101:13:50 Cernan (in Snoopy): Instead of 82.5 (degrees) down, your attitude is going to be changed, Tom. We're 123.5 down.
101:13:56 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK. See how the Z-axis tracks goes.
101:14:03 Duke: Snoop, Houston. We're satisfied...
101:14:05 Cernan (in Snoopy): What happened?
101:14:06 Duke: ...with the way the rendezvous radar is updating the state vector in P20 now. Over.
101:14:10 Stafford (in Snoopy): Z axis...
101:14:13 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, Charlie. Thank you.
101:14:17 Stafford (in Snoopy): That's Z axis track.
101:14:22 Cernan (in Snoopy): It's like moving a garbage can around.
101:14:51 Stafford (in Snoopy): Houston, Apollo 10. The Z-axis tracked and now looks real good and real solid.
101:15:01 Duke: Roger, Snoop. It looks good to us. Your range is coming right in there.
101:15:07 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger.
101:15:18 Cernan (in Snoopy): I'm only going to take one more mark, Tom, and then go into a P52.
101:15:21 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK. Let's see what it is. Noun 49, Enter. See what we got there. Beautiful.
P20, Verb 06 Noun 49.
101:15:26 Cernan (in Snoopy): That's good. Find out where that last mark is, so we can terminate, and go into - I'll get one more, and get out of there.
101:15:40 Young: OK. I'm tracking you guys optically. It's really working good.
101:15:47 Cernan (in Snoopy): Have you got our flashing light, John?
101:15:49 Young: Yes, it's beautiful.
101:15:55 Cernan (in Snoopy): Houston, just for information, every time we lose track with the S-band antenna it happened and it happens to bang into the stops, it pops the S-band antenna circuit breaker on 16. It's done that about three times...
101:16:09 Duke: Roger.
101:16:09 Cernan (in Snoopy): ...but it appears to recover all right.
101:16:10 Duke: Roger. Snoop, Houston. That's a normal..
101:16:15 Cernan (in Snoopy): [Garble] I'm going Omni antennas at this time.
101:16:20 Duke: Roger. We copy on the Omnis, and that's normal indication for the steerable: when it goes into the stops it will pop that breaker.
101:16:35 Cernan (in Snoopy): Down Voice Backup. That's Off; that's Off. OK, you got a hot mike, Tom
101:16:41 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK.
101:16:44 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, let's go to Verb 41, Noun 72. Enter. Plus 00000, Enter, plus 28300, Enter. See whether it's going.
Verb 41 Noun 72 terminates the rendezvous radar continuous marking, so that the crew can stow the RR and commence the P52 IMU realignment, using AOT for star tracking.
101:17:04 Stafford (in Snoopy): Radar is driving. Looks good.
The Rendezvous Radar antenna dish is moving to its parked position so that it is clear of most of the AOT field of view (fov), so that the P52 IMU realignment can be performed.
101:17:14 Cernan (in Snoopy): Alright. Pull your breakers.
101:17:15 Stafford (in Snoopy): Alright. Rendezvous Radar, DC, PGNS, Open. Rendezvous Radar, AC Bus A, Open.
101:17:27 Cernan (in Snoopy): Got your AOT Lamp breaker Closed?
101:17:30 Stafford (in Snoopy): AOT Lamp, Closed. Go.
101:17:43 Cernan (in Snoopy): And we call for Acrux at this point.
101:17:47 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK. Let me look at it. We're really using the fuel up on these maneuvers.
101:17:57 Cernan (in Snoopy): What's that look like to you?
101:17:59 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK. Roll is 211. That isn't bad. Pitch - that's OK. Go to it? Auto. Proceed.
101:18:12 Cernan (in Snoopy): Boy, it doesn't waste any time, does it?
The crew has instructed the LGC to perform an Automaneuver to acquire the star Acrux in the AOT. The LM RCS react immediately to change the spacecraft's attitude.
101:18:14 Stafford (in Snoopy): This thing feels like a big garbage can.
101:18:16 Cernan (in Snoopy): I tell you, it really does. Like it's banging against your head.
101:18:22 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, I've got a reticle. That's a start.
101:18:33 Stafford (in Snoopy): Oh, there's the Earth.
101:18:35 Cernan (in Snoopy): (Cough) You got the Earth again?
101:18:36 Stafford (in Snoopy): Right there.
101:18:36 Stafford (in Snoopy): Beautiful.
101:18:39 Cernan (in Snoopy): Oh, magnificent, Charlie, or Joe, or Tom. (Laughter) God dang that's unbelievable, isn't it?
101:18:46 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yep.
101:18:47 Cernan (in Snoopy): Looks like it's hanging out there on a string where you can touch it. Where the hell are we going?
101:18:52 Stafford (in Snoopy): Go to Acrux. When you're there, you're there.
101:18:58 Cernan (in Snoopy): Oh, man are we there. This alignment is so good, it's - it's pathetic.
101:19:01 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK. You ready? We're going to go to...
101:19:04 Cernan (in Snoopy): Oh, yeah, that's good. Don't even trim it.
101:19:06 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK, I'm going to go to PGNS and Pulse?
Stafford is requesting Mode Control PGNS to Auto, and Attitude Control in each of the three axis to Pulse. See detail at 097:18:27.
101:19:08 Cernan (in Snoopy): Yes.
101:19:12 Stafford (in Snoopy): There. Proceed.
101:19:13 Cernan (in Snoopy): PGNS and Pulse.
101:19:14 Stafford (in Snoopy): I'm going to see what...
101:19:16 Young: Did you guys turn off your tracking light?
101:19:17 Cernan (in Snoopy): No. Tell him we've maneuvered.
101:19:21 Young: OK. I guess you maneuvered, because I don't see you.
101:19:23 Stafford (in Snoopy): We've just maneuvered to start tracking Acrux. Over.
101:19:26 Young: OK.
101:19:50 Cernan (in Snoopy): The reticle on this thing is really bad. It won't stand it.
101:20:00 Duke: Snoop, Houston. We read you about three-by. Over.
101:20:03 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger, Houston. This is Snoopy. We're starting to mark on Acrux now for our P52. Over.
101:20:12 Cernan (in Snoopy): There's a Y, Tom.
101:20:13 Duke: Roger, Tom. We copy in the P52. Over.
101:20:14 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yep.
101:20:16 Cernan (in Snoopy): Stand by, Tom. Go.
101:20:17 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger.
101:20:53 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK.
101:20:54 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK.
101:21:17 Stafford (in Snoopy): Batteries went dead.
101:21:20 Cernan (in Snoopy): Batteries what?
101:21:21 Stafford (in Snoopy): On the Hasselblad. Went dead.
101:21:23 Cernan (in Snoopy): I had a film pack that jammed!
101:21:24 Stafford (in Snoopy): Then the batteries went dead (laughter). Oh, well.

101:21:40 Cernan (in Snoopy): Ready to mark what? Y.
101:21:41 Stafford (in Snoopy): Mark Y.
101:22:02 Cernan (in Snoopy): Mark Y, again.
101:22:04 Stafford (in Snoopy): Mark Y.
101:22:36 Cernan (in Snoopy): Mark Y, again.
101:22:37 Stafford (in Snoopy): Mark Y.
101:22:42 Cernan (in Snoopy): Boy, no wonder John's going blind.

101:23:32 Cernan (in Snoopy): Either one?
101:23:34 Stafford (in Snoopy): Either one.
101:24:07 Duke: Snoopy, Houston. To improve the comm, we'd like you to go to S-Band to Voice and S-Band ranging, Off. Over.
101:24:17 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger. S-Band-Voice; S-Band Ranging, Off. Over.
MCC-H are trying to find a solution to the LM communications issue and are unaware that the S-band steerable antenna is not currently tracking the Earth.
101:24:24 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK.
101:24:25 Duke: And Charlie Brown, Houston. When you lose the high gain, then go to Omni Delta. Over.
101:24:28 Cernan (in Snoopy): That's what it calls for, right here.
101:24:35 Young: Roger. Omni Delta.
101:24:42 Cernan (in Snoopy): How does that look to you? We're still in AGS by the way, babe.
101:24:48 Stafford (in Snoopy): It looks OK.
101:24:49 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. Ready?
101:24:50 Stafford (in Snoopy): Ready? Go.
101:24:54 Cernan (in Snoopy): It's going to go this way.
101:24:55 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes.
101:25:16 Cernan (in Snoopy): There it is, bigger than love.
The P52 program is now manoeuvring the LM to acquire Antares for further alignment marks.
101:25:18 Stafford (in Snoopy): Coming in, too.
101:25:22 Cernan (in Snoopy): Tom, that alignment we had; you know where the star is? The alignment we had is under the cross-hairs.
101:25:27 Stafford (in Snoopy): Is that right?
101:25:28 Cernan (in Snoopy): Under the cross hairs. That alignment we had was so good.
101:25:47 Cernan (in Snoopy): They might want to change the antennas since we moved, I don't know.
101:25:56 Young: I read you, Snoop.
101:26:00 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hello, Houston. This is Snoopy. How are you reading now?
101:26:05 Duke: Roger, Tom. You're about three-by now. A little bit better. Over.
101:26:09 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger. Charlie, I'm reading you loud and clear now. Over.
101:26:15 Duke: Roger, We - we have low bit rate, that's all, Snoop. When you get through your P52, we'd like your torquing angles.
101:26:23 Stafford (in Snoopy): Roger. And on the first Automaneuver to the star, Houston - to Acrux - it put the reticle right on the very center of the star there. So it looks like our first alignment was beautiful.
101:26:40 Duke: Roger, Snoop. We copy. Over.
101:26:43 Stafford (in Snoopy): And we're now marking on Antares.
101:26:49 Duke: Roger, Snoop. Out.
101:27:06 Cernan (in Snoopy): You know, John could really be going blind by the time he finishes this flight, after doing all this stuff.
101:27:11 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes.
101:27:33 Cernan (in Snoopy): Mark either, Tom.
101:27:34 Stafford (in Snoopy): Either one.
101:28:22 Young: Did you guys see that mark I just bought?
101:28:32 Stafford (in Snoopy): Hello, Charlie Brown. Snoopy. Were you calling?
101:28:34 Young: No. I was talking to Houston.
Your browser does not support the audio element. Download LM DSEA onboard MP3 audio file. Clip courtesy John Stoll, ACR Senior Technician at NASA Johnson.
101:28:38 Duke: Charlie Brown, Houston. Go ahead. Reading you about three-by. Over.
101:28:46 Young: Roger. Did you see that Mark I just bought? With the big Delta-V and everything? Did you all read the data?
101:28:58 Duke: Charlie Brown, Houston. Say again. You're unreadable.
101:29:03 Young: Roger. I say again. Do you all read what I'm doing?
101:29:07 Duke: Roger. We see you're in P20. Over.
101:29:12 Stafford (in Snoopy): Program alarm. Too many marks? Verb 5.
Verb 05 Noun 09 displays alarm codes from the LGC on the DSKY. Program alarm 00114 is displayed, indicating a mark has been made but is not desired.
101:29:19 Cernan (in Snoopy): I probably marked on the same thing twice. What's that say?
101:29:32 Young: Roger. I just bought a rather large optics mark and it brought it right back up there into the scope here.
100:29:34 Stafford (in Snoopy): More than five marks see. Well I figure you were marking like mad here.
101:29:37 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, I guess maybe that's right.
101:29:39 Stafford (in Snoopy): I got to Reset. Key Release.
Depressing the RSET key on the DSKY turns off the LGC alarm indicator. Depressing the KEY REL key relinquishes the DSKY from its current operation.
101:29:42 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. Proceed.
101:29:43 Stafford (in Snoopy): And Proceed.
101:29:44 Stafford (in Snoopy): Beautiful.
101:29:46 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK, you want to write those down, or you want me to?
101:29:50 Stafford (in Snoopy): I'll get them.
101:29:51 Cernan (in Snoopy): Houston, the star angle difference is 4 balls 2. Houston, are you reading?
101:30:03 Duke: Roger. Go ahead. 4 balls 2 on the star angle difference. How about the torquing angles?
101:30:09 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. Minus 00169, plus 00050, plus 3 balls 66.
The IMU gimbal torquing angles that the LGC has computed based on the results of the P52 IMU realignment procedure are, outer gimbal 001.69°, inner gimbal 000.50°, middle gimbal 000.66°. These angles are displayed on the DSKY registers whilst Verb 06 Noun 93 flashes.
101:30:25 Duke: Roger. We copy, Snoop. Out.
101:30:30 Cernan (in Snoopy): Oh, hell. Let's do a real quick check here.
101:30:36 Stafford (in Snoopy): What do you want? You want to check the COAS?
101:30:40 Cernan (in Snoopy): Yes. Do you want to check the COAS?
101:30:41 Stafford (in Snoopy): Check the COAS, position 5.
Stafford is fitting the Crew Optical Alignment Sight (COAS) to a bracket above the LM left hand window, to use in taking a mark on a star to compare with the P52 marks taken using the AOT.
Crew Optical Alignment Sight (COAS) mounted for viewing through the left forward window.
101:30:46 Cernan (in Snoopy): What star, have you got out in front of you?
101:30:47 Stafford (in Snoopy): I've got the Earth. Go get An - what about Antares? What did you just mark on? Antares?
101:30:54 Cernan (in Snoopy): Yes. I just marked on Antares.
101:30:59 Young: What kind of range you got, Tom? About 200 miles [370 km]?
101:30:56 Stafford (in Snoopy): Let's take it up to it. Ready?
101:31:03 Cernan (in Snoopy): Wait a minute. Did I do that right?
101:31:06 Stafford (in Snoopy): No, no, no.
101:31:07 Cernan (in Snoopy): Why no, no, no?
101:31:08 Stafford (in Snoopy): Call 52 again.
Call program P52 (IMU alignment) on the PNGS via the DSKY.
101:31:10 Cernan (in Snoopy): Give it approximate range.
101:31:12 Duke: Charlie Brown, Houston - Charlie Brown, Houston. We are satisfied with your P20. Your NAV's looking good to us. Over.
101:31:19 Young: Roger. Looks good to me too.
101:31:25 Duke: And, John, you are barely readable, about two by. Stand by. We might have an antenna problem.
101:31:31 Young: Roger. We got one. I'll go to Omni D.
101:31:36 Cernan (in Snoopy): Where'd that angle come from?
101:31:40 Stafford (in Snoopy): Forget it, ignore it, ignore it.
101:31:41 Cernan (in Snoopy): It shouldn't be in there; I'll try to zero it.
101:31:43 Stafford (in Snoopy): Zero it.
101:31:48 Duke: Charlie Brown, Houston.
101:31:50 Young: Houston, Charlie Brown. How do you read?
101:31:53 Stafford (in Snoopy): Auto.
101:31:54 Duke: We are looking right up your tailpipe there, and your comm is pretty bad. Did you copy, Charlie Brown?
101:31:57 Cernan (in Snoopy): Ready?
101:31:58 Duke: We are looking up your tailpipe, the comm is pretty bad.
The current attitude of the CSM has the SPS engine pointing towards the Earth. The communications line of sight is coming right up from behind the CSM. This is not optimum for reception by the CSM, steerable or Omni antennae.
101:31:59 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes.
101:32:03 Young: Houston, Charlie Brown. Omni D. How do you read?
101:32:05 Duke: Snoopy, go ahead.
101:32:15 Duke: Charlie Brown. Houston. Go ahead.
101:32:26 Cernan (in Snoopy): You got it?
101:32:27 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. [Garble]. Hold on now, let's do 1.
101:32:33 Cernan (in Snoopy): There it is, babe - oh, beautiful. How's that look?
101:32:38 Stafford (in Snoopy): A quarter of a degree down.
101:32:39 Cernan (in Snoopy): Why don't you just write it on there?
101:32:45 Duke: Charlie Brown, Houston. We'll have LOS in 101:36.
101:32:50 Stafford (in Snoopy): Oh, I'll make it a third.
101:32:51 Duke: We'll see you over the hill at 102:22. And, Snoop, LOS for you, 101 - correction, 101:37, AOS 102:25. Over.
101:33:04 Cernan (in Snoopy): If you're satisfied. terminate it.
101:33:06 Stafford (in Snoopy): Go - go back to P00.
101:33:11 Cernan (in Snoopy): Call it again, just right over it. OK, Tom. Let's go to the attitude to find tracking, and we've got to track now again. At...
101:33:27 Cernan (in Snoopy): This is Snoopy. Roger. We got that.
101:33:29 Cernan (in Snoopy): We want to try and get a number of marks here. At minus 1:29, and how far are we now? The burn is at 102:55, so we're at 1:20, so we want to go find it.
1 hour, 20 minutes approximately until the insertion burn.
101:33:30 Duke: Roger.
101:33:42 Duke: Roger, Charlie Brown and Snoop, as you are going over the hill, all the systems are Go. We're all Go here on the ground, and it's looking great. Over.
101:33:51 Cernan (in Snoopy): Thank you, Charlie. Snoopy's Go here. Our P52's complete. We're going to pick up P20 again.
101:33:54 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. Tom. if you want to find out where it is - Want to go to the target? I've got the AGS needles for you.
101:34:00 Duke: Copy.
101:34:10 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes, let's go to AGS.
101:34:12 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK.
101:34:14 Stafford (in Snoopy): I'm in the -
101:34:18 Cernan (in Snoopy): You want this in AGS?
101:34:20 Stafford (in Snoopy): No. I want it DAP first.
101:34:22 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. now you can find out where it is. There's where it is.
101:34:26 Stafford (in Snoopy): Okay. I'll go. Okay, I'm in Direct. I'll go down to here.
Stafford is confirming that he is in Direct-Attitude Control position. When in PGNS, Direct mode can be used in any axis. Displacing the ACA a quarter of a full throw, causes continuous two-jet RCS firing for the selected axes. The acceleration induced by this firing has to be manually nulled, to stop the motion.
101:34:36 Cernan (in Snoopy): Now on the Orb-rate ball at this time. What time is it. Tom; 101:34. And it's normally been 101:24? I guess we're about 150 miles from John. huh?
101:34:57 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. Hey, where's the food?
101:35:02 Cernan (in Snoopy): Hey, Charlie Brown. This is Snoop. I guess we are about 150 miles from you.
101:35:11 Young: Roger.
101:35:13 Cernan (in Snoopy): And our P50 - our P52 is complete. We're coming over to start tracking on you.
101:35:20 Young: Yes. I show you [garble] 179.22 [nautical miles, 331.9 km] [garble].
101:35:23 Cernan (in Snoopy): Sounds right.
101:35:25 Duke: Charlie Brown, this is Houston. Did you get your AOS/LOS times? Over.
And we have lost the signal on Charlie Brown. About 40 seconds away from losing the signal with Snoopy. And Snoopy has gone behind the Moon now on the 13th lunar revolution. We acquired Charlie Brown first. He reported that Snoopy had reported the DOI burn and that he felt it was a good one. And then when Snoopy came within range, Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan confirmed that the Descent Orbit Insertion burn had been on time and they were reading an onboard orbit of 61.2 by 9.2 nautical miles [113.3 x 27.4 km]. They were down among the boulders, obviously very impressed at what they were seeing. Communications were bad a large part of this pass as we lost lock on the high gain antenna. Then shortly before the phasing burn, you could hear Gene Cernan calling out the checklist for the burn to Tom Stafford. They were on what is called VOX - voice operated circuits - talking to each other on board. We had a good phasing burn. This maneuver coming slightly more than 10 minutes after Snoopy had passed over landing site 2. He reported that both cameras aboard Snoopy had failed during this low pass. This phasing maneuver will put Snoopy behind and below Charlie Brown. The Descent Orbit Insertion had placed Snoopy out ahead. Now they've burned into an orbit with an apocynthion of 190 nautical miles [352 km] and a pericynthion of 11.8 nautical miles [21.9 km]. So Snoopy will start dropping behind and will go behind and below Charlie Brown to reach the position where it will have the same lighting and the same position as the Lunar Module on Apollo 11 will have after lift-off from the lunar surface. This phasing maneuver was done at 10% throttle for the first 26 seconds and then full throttle. You heard Gene Cernan call off the numbers of the Delta-V as it burned down. Acquisition for Charlie Brown will be at 102 hours, 22 minutes, 22 seconds and for Snoopy; 102 hours, 25 minutes, 37 seconds; not quite 45 minutes from now. The next maneuver to be performed will be ranging which will come near 102 hours, 45 minutes. We have tape of a briefing by Pete Frank, Flight Director on the shift preceding this shift and there has been a request that we play that on the release line. We'll do that now.
101:35:48 Stafford (in Snoopy): Whew! How about some foodsville?
It's been quite a while since the crew ate prior to the solo operations.
101:35:52 Cernan (in Snoopy): I guess so, babe. I just - I'm so sick and tired of these god-dang magazines failing. You know it?
101:36:04 Stafford (in Snoopy): Where's the food bag?
101:36:06 Cernan (in Snoopy): It's up in that two-man food bag.
101:36:08 Stafford (in Snoopy): I want to watch this come in.
Stafford wants to monitor the Rendezvous Radar track of the CSM Charlie Brown.
101:36:13 Cernan (in Snoopy): All we got left is a roll of interior film.
101:36:17 Stafford (in Snoopy): Everything else is gone?
101:36:19 Cernan (in Snoopy): I'll have to check. I can't get the damn thing to work at all.
101:36:44 Stafford (in Snoopy): OK, I guess we ought to talk for the record. What we observed as we came across the mare area into the landing site, the basic area looked fairly smooth...
101:36:51 Cernan (in Snoopy): Actually, it looked amazingly smooth, Tom, I thought.
101:36:54 Stafford (in Snoopy): It looked amazingly smooth, and it looks like we have plenty of landing surface down...
101:36:59 Cernan (in Snoopy): I think you can land down there in and among those holes.
101:37:00 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes.
101:37:29 Cernan (in Snoopy): This works after you jam that contact open, but you don't have time to jam a god-dang contact open.
During the low-altitude pass, the Lunar Module 16-mm camera failed to operate with magazine F installed. Magazine F was replaced immediately with magazine G, and the camera operated satisfactorily. Magazine F was reinstalled later for staging and the terminal phase of the rendezvous, and the camera operated satisfactorily. Proper alignment of the camera and the magazine required greater care with magazine F because of marginal clearances at the interface surfaces and edges.

101:37:50 Stafford (in Snoopy): I can't hold my - the hose is floating up, you know it?
101:37:57 Cernan (in Snoopy): Boy, chicken again. And that waters good now.
101:38:01 Stafford (in Snoopy): Got bubbles?
101:38:03 Cernan (in Snoopy): No. Yes, there is.
The crew reported that the Lunar Module drinking water contained gas. The nitrogen used to pressurize the water system permeates the tank bladder, and the water becomes saturated within 100 hours after servicing. As the absolute pressure is reduced the dissolved nitrogen is released. The first water withdrawn should have contained about 12 percent of gas. At staging, the mixture should have contained 6.3 percent nitrogen because of the reduced water tank pressure at that time. The water hose, water gun, and connecting plumbing were not serviced and this entrapped air would initially add to the problem.
101:38:20 Cernan (in Snoopy): Let's see, we've got to get some tracking on this guy. We're late now.
101:38:24 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. Shit.
101:38:41 Stafford (in Snoopy): That's the trouble with these darn air vents.
Bubbles are present in the water that Cernan has injected in to his food pack.
101:38:46 Cernan (in Snoopy): 05 55 02 - 42 [garble].
101:39:24 Cernan (in Snoopy): What do we have in the way of 70 millimeter film? Jack was saying we could strip the back side of that area...
101:39:34 Stafford (in Snoopy): The Hassel...
101:39:36 Cernan (in Snoopy): ...on top - that Hasselblad.
101:39:37 Stafford (in Snoopy): ...the Hasselblad went dead, babe!
101:39:39 Cernan (in Snoopy): The whole Hasselblad?
101:39:40 Stafford (in Snoopy): Just as I was - That's what I was bitching about: the Hasselblad burned out as I hit the landing site! That's why I was so fucking mad.
101:39:50 Cernan (in Snoopy): Are you kidding?
101:39:52 Stafford (in Snoopy): I'm not kidding. It's dead!
101:39:53 Cernan (in Snoopy): It doesn't work at all?
101:39:56 Stafford (in Snoopy): No.
During the low-altitude lunar pass, the Hasselblad 70-mm camera, which had the last magazine installed, stopped because of film binding in the magazine. The binding resulted from internal damage to the film advance mechanism, including burrs on the film guide. The emulsion scraped from the film by the burrs built up on the rollers, decreasing the clearance. This condition continuously overloaded the drive motor until the motor failed approximately five frames from the end of film. The 1.6-ampere fuse in the camera would have protected the motor against a direct short, but not against a continuous overload.
101:40:04 Cernan (in Snoopy): On one of my magazines, you have to ja - Look at, even now, you got to jam it in. Look it. Light goes out - there it goes.
101:40:18 Cernan (in Snoopy): I'm so sick and tired of film that doesn't - that doesn't check out working beforehand.
101:40:39 Cernan (in Snoopy): Boy, that ascent engine is going to be a kick in the - in the ass.
Cernan is pointing out that the Ascent Propulsion System (APS) engine burn at Insertion will be far more obvious than the acceleration from the DPS during the DOI and Phasing burns. This is due to the far lower mass of the LM now that the descent stage has been separated from.
101:41:14 Stafford (in Snoopy): There. Are you ready for it?
101:41:18 Cernan (in Snoopy): Wait a minute. OK, now I am. Go ahead. Do I put it in PGNS Auto and let the Z-axis track?
101:41:27 Stafford (in Snoopy): Yes. Let me get near it, so it doesn't...
101:41:48 Stafford (in Snoopy): What is it?
101:41:50 Cernan (in Snoopy): Put it in Auto Track, Tom, and we'll call up 20 again.
The Rendezvous Radar (RR) mode select switch on panel 3 is placed in the Auto Track position. In this position the RR maintains track of the CSM transponder by comparing the received radar signals from the three channels. The errors are used to drive the radar servos. Once the RR is in this mode, the crew call up P20 again to take navigation marks on the CSM using the RR data, to update the LM or CSM state vector in the LGC.
101:42:12 Cernan (in Snoopy): It's been looking right at it, I guess, huh?
101:42:56 Cernan (in Snoopy): Son of a gun, it did it again.
The initial P20 range rate readout is again an erroneous figure.
101:43:49 Stafford (in Snoopy): Oh, sh- Reject that there.
101:44:04 Stafford (in Snoopy): How about some fruit cocktail? Does that sound good?
101:44:09 Cernan (in Snoopy): I'd love some.
101:44:23 Cernan (in Snoopy): There's - there's a mark, Tom.
101:44:28 Young: Are you guys looking directly at me? Over.
101:44:30 Cernan (in Snoopy): That's affirm. We're tracking on you now, John.
101:44:34 Young: Roger. I'm checking my lights.
101:44:42 Cernan (in Snoopy): Tom, do I put it in Z-axis track here, do you know?
101:44:45 Stafford (in Snoopy): Go ahead, go ahead.
101:44:46 Cernan (in Snoopy): Or do I take it out?
101:44:47 Stafford (in Snoopy): Go to PGNS and Auto.
101:44:49 Cernan (in Snoopy): OK. PGNS?
101:44:50 Stafford (in Snoopy): You can track him in Z-axis.
