Flight Plan page 3-76a.
123:25:03 Cernan (onboard): Right here it is.
123:25:05 Young (onboard): Oh. OK. I got to have that.
123:25:07 Cernan (onboard): You want that down there?
123:25:10 Young (onboard): Well, I need it.
123:25:11 Cernan (onboard): What can I do on this? Now, out this side - Hey, you guys...
123:25:13 Young (onboard): Just take targets of opportunity.
Young is suggesting that Cernan keeps busy with target of opportunity photography, whilst he and Stafford are occupied with the landmark tracking.
123:25:14 Cernan (onboard): OK. Fine. That's what I was planning on doing.
123:25:19 Young (onboard): That crater 3-0-what-you-call-it is a - really a it's a...
123:25:23 Cernan (onboard): That's on Tom's side.
123:25:25 Young (onboard): That - that tall peak in it is going to make this really something else.
123:25:35 Stafford (onboard): Hey, John; where are our clips? Did we lose all those bastards?
123:25:41 Young (onboard): Guess they're on the LM.
123:26:01 Young (onboard): Haven't heard any or that humming noise today. Have you?
123:26:04 Cernan (onboard): No.
123:26:06 Young (onboard): Suppose it's coming through the VHF?
123:26:08 Cernan (onboard): I guess.
123:26:12 Stafford (onboard): Sunrise is 123:32:14, and I got the solar corona out there now.
123:26:19 Young (onboard): You do?
123:26:25 Stafford (onboard): Yes, 123:26. I've seen it for a while. That's 6 minutes before sunrise.
123:26:29 Young (onboard): Yes.
123:26:35 Cernan (onboard): [Garble].
123:26:36 Stafford (onboard): See it?
123:26:37 Cernan (onboard): Yes.
123:26:49 Cernan (onboard): Look at that Sun - a big red blob. Activity on the whole front.
123:27:09 Stafford (onboard): You got that special color film - in there?
123:27:11 Cernan (onboard): Yes.
123:27:13 Stafford (onboard): OK, what I'll do is shoot that peak in 310 and also pop in some...
Crater 310 is today known as Icarus.
123:27:16 Cernan (onboard): Shoot what?
123:27:17 Stafford (onboard): I'll shoot the peak in 310, and also shoot some in black and white.
123:27:21 Cernan (onboard): OK. I got the black and white in there now. If you'll shoot it first there, I've got - I'll give you the - I'll reload it for you.
123:27:32 Stafford (onboard): We're right at the terminator on the 26th rev. Shit, I think - 310 is - is out - It's gone. You never see it.
123:27:44 Cernan (onboard): That right?
Crater 310 has now slipped into darkness, so no further still photography is possible. Some 16mm coverage was obtain at the beginning of magazine F, shot from the LM.
123:27:46 Stafford (onboard): Is [garble] on?
123:27:49 Cernan (onboard): Yes.
123:27:51 Stafford (onboard): Let me have a black and white in it. That's before we get to 150 west. No it isn't. I'm sorry.
123:28:09 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] 250 [garble].
123:28:15 Stafford (onboard): Well, that near - the - terminator stuff - It'll be nearly - It might be 5, 6, or [garble] That's my job.
123:28:24 Cernan (onboard): My job's down to 125th, Tom.
123:28:26 Young (onboard): Good bit.
123:28:27 Cernan (onboard): Yes.
123:28:40 Young (onboard): Two balls 875...
123:28:42 Stafford (onboard): 123:25 and 36.
123:28:43 Young (onboard): ...five balls.
123:29:11 Young (onboard): What's really bad is the back side is so high and the front side is so damn low.
123:29:19 Stafford (onboard): You can sure see what's happened to our orbit since...
123:29:21 Cernan (onboard): Yes
123:30:10 Stafford (onboard): 123:29:36. That ought to be...
123:30:41 Stafford (onboard): There's 150 west. In about 8 minutes, that peak comes up.
123:30:52 Young (onboard): That's the one to get. Just the peak stands up?
123:30:58 Stafford (onboard): That's going to be all.
123:31:00 Young (onboard): Too bad.
123:31:02 Stafford (onboard): John, CP-1 comes into view at 38:14.
123:31:07 Young (onboard): OK.
123:31:46 Stafford (onboard): Here comes the Sun.
123:31:51 Cernan (onboard): You're right, and you have 16 to go?
123:31:54 Young (onboard): You guys get that corona the other day?
123:31:56 Stafford (onboard): No.
123:31:57 Cernan (onboard): No, we did not.
123:31:58 Young (onboard): Take a picture of it?
123:31:59 Cernan (onboard): I just took some now, earlier today. But you know, it didn't give you any warning, though. It's bang, and it's there - a - the Sun.
123:32:09 Young (onboard): Yes.
123:32:10 Cernan (onboard): You're looking at the Sun. It wipes you out.
123:32:13 Stafford (onboard): It says 1:32, and right there it is. Have they ever got us fixed. Here comes the Sun. Look out.
123:32:20 Cernan (onboard): Bang. Boy, I've never seen anything come over just bang.
123:32:38 Cernan (onboard): Have you seen [garble]? [Garble].
123:32:48 Young (onboard): When do we acquire?
123:32:49 Cernan (onboard): [Garble].
123:32:50 Stafford (onboard): OK, babe. CP-l at 123:38:14.
123:32:56 Young (onboard): OK.
123:32:57 Cernan (onboard): 123:32:33.
123:33:36 Young (onboard): [Garble].
123:33:40 Cernan (onboard): Oh, that's not very grubby.
123:33:47 Young (onboard): [Garble], couldn't we? San Francisco?
123:33:51 Stafford (onboard): Do what?
123:33:52 Cernan (onboard): We - Look like this thing is getting ready to [garble].
123:34:20 Cernan (onboard): Boy, don't you suppose you'd get a sunburn in that, Tom?
123:34:22 Young (onboard): Ho-ho.
123:34:26 Stafford (onboard): In such short order, you couldn't believe it.
123:34:42 Unidentified speaker (onboard): [Coughing.]
123:34:46 Cernan (onboard): Oh man. Feel that through the window. Whoo!
123:34:49 Stafford (onboard): Put your hand there. It gets a little warm, doesn't it?
123:34:53 Young (onboard): [Garble] Earthrise [garble].
123:35:15 Cernan (onboard): Tom. You want [garble] try to take of opportunity on down here?
123:35:21 Stafford (onboard): No. I got to stay here and fly this thing and correlate it in. Since I got the [garble] time in.
123:36:42 Cernan (onboard): Oh.
123:36:43 Stafford (onboard): OK. That's 36. John. You can pick it up 38:14. I can't give you any help out [garble]. The Sun's right in my eye - window.
123:36:52 Young (onboard): No problem, babe.
123:36:56 Stafford (onboard): CP-1 is that [garble] - We'll be coming across crater number IX.
Stafford is referring to basin IX which is today known as the crater Mendeleev.
123:37:02 Cernan (onboard): Is Sunrise out here?
123:37:04 Stafford (onboard): Yes, you won't see it looking down...
123:37:05 Young (onboard): Coming up right now, Tom.
123:37:07 Stafford (onboard): We passed the terminator.
123:37:17 Young (onboard): It's now 37:20. It's 38. When is this supposed to pick this up?
123:37:26 Stafford (onboard): 38:14.
123:37:30 Young (onboard): Christ, I don't believe that.
123:37:32 Stafford (onboard): Huh?
123:37:33 Young (onboard): Don't believe that.
123:37:41 Stafford (onboard): I'm afraid that [crater] 310's in darkness. Oh, there it is. Not much good to shoot it. You couldn't tell the [garble] a thing about it.
123:37:52 Young (onboard): There he is. There we go.
123:37:58 Cernan (onboard): Okay. You're at - 38 minutes right now.
123:38:03 Young (onboard): Yes. Could you pitch up just a hair, Tom? About 5 degrees.
123:38:26 Young (onboard): There you go. Good show.
123:38:39 Young (onboard): That crater has got the uglies.
123:39:02 Cernan: What's our 150 - degree one time, Tom?
123:39:05 Stafford (onboard): It's counting up at 09:30 right now. 10 minutes.
123:39:18 Stafford (onboard): OK.
123:39:20 Young (onboard): One damn thing you've got to pass is that 50-degree program alarm. It won't go up there. That does piss me off!
123:39:25 Stafford (onboard): 123:39:25.
123:39:28 Cernan (onboard): Go up, you bastard.
123:39:30 Stafford (onboard): OK, at 41:13, you should be on it; but I can't give you much help, babe.
123:39:34 Young (onboard): OK. I've got it. I've got it. I've got it.
123:39:37 Stafford (onboard): Oh, yes.
123:39:38 Young (onboard): Where am I supposed to make marks - at 41:13?
123:39:41 Stafford (onboard): That's - You're supposed to make marks at 41:13.
123:39:46 Young (onboard): OK. There you go. Get them, Tiger.
123:39:57 Stafford (onboard): Let me know when, babe.
123:39:59 Young (onboard): OK. [Garble]. There we are. Here we come across the old 225.
Crater 225 is today known as Coriolis.
123:40:12 Stafford (onboard): Yes, you're across 225; and there that little bastard is. I can see it, John.
123:40:20 Cernan (onboard): [Garble], Tom?
123:40:22 Young (onboard): 225.
123:40:24 Cernan (onboard): We're not from - from - from 150 west. We're not 10 minutes, then, are we?
123:40:29 Stafford (onboard): Oh, yes. We're - we're 10 - we're 11 minutes.
123:40:33 Cernan (onboard): OK.
123:40:36 Stafford (onboard): There it is. Up on that - peak.
123:40:56 Young (onboard): [Garble]?
123:41:01 Stafford (onboard): Supposed to mark at 41. Got about 10 seconds.
123:41:34 Young (onboard): OK, babe. Let's go.
123:41:35 Stafford (onboard): Hit it. OK. One mark, huh? Supposed to be flashing? 51?
The crew will be using program 22, the orbital navigation program in the CMC for taking the marks on the lunar landmarks. A flashing Verb 51 is prompting the CMP to begin taking marks on the current landmark.
123:41:48 Young (onboard): Yes.
123:41:50 Stafford (onboard): I got a 16 92.
In P22, a Verb 16 Noun 92 is displaying new CM optics angles, shaft angle on R1 and trunnion angle on R2.
123:41:51 Young (onboard): Alright.
123:41:54 Stafford (onboard): Okay. 15 seconds gone. 20 seconds. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. Did you get it?
123:42:27 Young (onboard): Yes.
123:42:29 Stafford (onboard): OK. There's two marks. 10. 15.
123:42:36 Young (onboard): Shit! There went the other one.
123:42:41 Stafford (onboard): 20. 25. 30. 35. Three. Want me to pitch down for you?
123:43:03 Young (onboard): No. Yes, you can a little.
123:43:06 Stafford (onboard): 10. 20. Maybe I should take these. 20. 25. That's four. Need one more. 5. 10. 15. 20. Got it? That's...
123:43:40 Young (onboard): No, that ain't going to do it.
123:43:43 Stafford (onboard): Oh.
123:43:44 Young (onboard): [Garble] lost it.
123:43:50 Stafford (onboard): OK.
123:44:10 Stafford (onboard): Where'd I put my pencil around here? Somebody - You got an extra pencil?
123:44:16 Young (onboard): Yes.
123:44:18 Cernan (onboard): I got one with lead in it.
123:44:19 Young (onboard): [Garble].
123:44:21 Stafford (onboard): I got it. Let me know what you get. Next one is CP-2 at 23:53. We got - we got about 10 minutes to the next one.
123:44:36 Young (onboard): Yes. We got plenty of time.
123:44:38 Cernan (onboard): Tom, could you give me a hack in about 20 minutes?
123:45:05 Stafford (onboard): Huh?
123:45:06 Cernan (onboard): Give me a hack in 16 minutes.
123:45:08 Young (onboard): I don't have my watch [garble].
123:45:09 Stafford (onboard): OK. [Garble].
123:45:20 Stafford (onboard): 15 seconds.
123:45:26 Young (onboard): Jesus Christ (coughing).
123:45:35 Stafford (onboard): 2, 1...
123:45:36 Stafford (onboard): Mark it.
123:45:50 Stafford (onboard): Let me know what you get there.
123:45:53 Young (onboard): Yes, I - I don't think it makes any damn difference [garble].
123:45:58 Stafford (onboard): Yes. I'll just write it down.
123:45:59 Young (onboard): Yes.
123:46:00 Stafford (onboard): Zero zero - What was it? Shit, it's already gone now.
123:46:06 Young (onboard): Yes. Don't worry about it.
123:46:41 Cernan (onboard): Tom, [garble].
123:46:45 Young (onboard): When are we supposed to get this one?
123:46:47 Stafford (onboard): OK. F-1.
123:46:50 Young (onboard): No. This is CP-2.
123:46:51 Stafford (onboard): CP-2. It'd be a plus - zero angle at 23:53:35.
123:47:03 Cernan (onboard): It's dark right on the - Boy, that's coming up in broad daylight, isn't it?
123:47:14 Young (onboard): Yes.
123:47:34 Young (onboard): Pshew!
123:48:36 Stafford (onboard): OK, CP-2. Now, John, it's more, so - Which way you want me to roll? Right, 5 degrees?
123:48:44 Young (onboard): Huh?
123:48:45 Stafford (onboard): It's more than 5 miles. You want me to roll right 5 degrees?
123:48:48 Young (onboard): Roll right 5 degrees.
123:49:50 Stafford (onboard): We're coming up to number - We're coming up to Florida. On your right.
123:50:00 Young (onboard): (Singing) "Florida, the land of flowers and summer showers. No other place is half so nice [garble] paradise." I've got to get back to Florida, come to think of it.
John Young grew up in Florida.
123:50:17 Stafford (onboard): Okay, you've got about 3 minutes to go for it. There's old crater 217.
Crater 217 is today known as Hartmann.
123:50:28 Young (onboard): Yes, man.
123:50:56 Young (onboard): OK, it's starting to move.
123:51:00 Stafford (onboard): I got your IP at the crater straight ahead up here.
123:51:04 Young (onboard): OK, the freaking optics ain't moved yet. They won't move until I get 50 degrees on that angle. You rolled right, didn't you?
123:51:16 Stafford (onboard): Rolled right 5 degrees, babe.
123:51:19 Young (onboard): OK. I'm looking out here to go straight up and down. I may ask you to roll 5 more degrees, OK?
123:51:26 Stafford (onboard): OK.
123:51:44 Young (onboard): Good. I'm going to use this goddam - I'm going to use the telescope.
123:52:02 Stafford (onboard): Did it jam on you?
Stafford is concerned that the sextant may have jammed. However Young is referring to the problem he is having with apparent whiteout of the landmarks CP-2 and F-1 in the small field of view of the sextant.
123:52:03 Young (onboard): [Garble].
123:52:04 Stafford (onboard): Huh?
123:52:01 Young (onboard): Don't worry. You got two more revs.
123:52:15 Stafford (onboard): OK. I got your IP [garble].
123:52:35 Stafford (onboard): Those black boulders down on that crater - That's right there on the IP for this one, up on the ridge. Really pronounced.
123:53:14 Stafford (onboard): OK, babe. The IP's right underneath you. You've got the next crater after that leading in. You've got the string up here of these volcanic craters...
123:53:26 Young (onboard): Yes.
123:53:27 Stafford (onboard): ...a volcanic chain, and then right on the other side is the ridge. There's that little pimple...
123:53:32 Young (onboard): Yes.
123:53:33 Stafford (onboard): ...Yes, and that's it. I got that rascal for you [garble].
123:53:35 Young (onboard): [Garble].
123:53:40 Stafford (onboard): You know, this terrain doesn't look near as rough as it did in these [garble] photos.
123:53:42 Young (onboard): I agree with that.
123:53:49 Stafford (onboard): I've got your little pimple up there: CP-2. That little mountain on the other side, and then it goes over on the crater 282, and there it is.
Crater 282 is today known as Gregory Q.
123:54:16 Young (onboard): IP.
123:54:18 Stafford (onboard): Oh, you can see the IP now, huh?
123:54:21 Young (onboard): Yes.
123:54:33 Young (onboard): There she goes. Miss America.
123:54:36 Cernan (onboard): (Coughing).
123:54:44 Stafford (onboard): OK, I've got that bear. OK, at 55:17. He's pretty close. Yes, you should be coming in here to it. You're lined up real good, John. I can see the bear down there.
123:55:18 Young (onboard): OK.
123:55:19 Stafford (onboard): Tell me when.
123:55:28 Stafford (onboard): Mark.
123:55:33 Young (onboard): Time to mark?
123:55:34 Stafford (onboard): Did you mark one?
123:55:35 Young (onboard): No, I haven't yet. I'm doing it right now.
John Young is now taking Marks on landmark CP-2.
123:55:37 Stafford (onboard): OK, good show. 5 seconds, 10, 15, 20, 25.
123:56:11 Stafford (onboard): 5, 10, minus 50. Gene-o, stand by to shoot the Earth coming up with that special black and white.
123:56:20 Cernan (onboard): Take some color?
123:56:22 Stafford (onboard): Yes. 20, 25. Two marks.
123:56:31 Young (onboard): That's three.
123:56:32 Stafford (onboard): Three, pardon me. 5...
123:56:35 Cernan (onboard): What time's it coming up?
123:56:37 Stafford (onboard): Shortly. Just watch for it. 10, 15, 20, 25. One more. We'll be there in 5 seconds.
123:56:57 Cernan (onboard): 5 seconds? OK.
123:56:59 Stafford (onboard): 5, 10, 15. 20, 25.
123:57:12 Young (onboard): God Almighty. Whew!
123:57:19 Stafford (onboard): OK, [garble] 24 � 0 - Wait a minute. What did he say? AOS is 12 - I'm sorry, 24:04. I was looking here, Gene-o. That's 24:04:06...
123:57:36 Young (onboard): [Garble].
123:57:37 Stafford (onboard): 04:21 - 24:04, Let's see. At 24:04, start looking for it.
123:57:44 Young (onboard): What time you got in your log?
123:57:49 Cernan (onboard): Plus...
123:57:50 Stafford (onboard): You mean in...
123:57:51 Young (onboard): [Garble].
123:57:53 Stafford (onboard): 28:16.
123:58:07 Stafford (onboard): OK, F-1 is north 10 miles - Just keep the same roll?
123:58:10 Young (onboard): Yes, that's a good roll.
123:58:14 Stafford (onboard): Once you get this big bear established here, I can hold Orb Rate without hardly firing those thrusters.
123:58:21 Young (onboard): Good.
123:59:11 Young (onboard): Well, it looks like we're tracking the same landmark.
123:59:15 Stafford (onboard): What you - let me record that, John.
123:59:18 Young (onboard): 63956.
123:59:22 Stafford (onboard): 0062.4, plus 63956, plus 00195 (coughing).
123:59:52 Young (onboard): On this next one?
123:59:55 Stafford (onboard): The next one is F-1, and it's 124:06. About 2 minutes after we get Earth track.
Flight Plan page 3-78.
124:00:02 Young (onboard): OK.
124:00:06 Stafford (onboard): Earth comes up at 24:04:21.
124:00:23 Young (onboard): I'm going to use the vector on this for sure. I need a telescope.
124:00:39 Cernan (onboard): Tom, what's the Earth [garble]?
124:00:42 Stafford (onboard): Pardon me?
124:00:45 Cernan (onboard): [Garble].
124:00:47 Stafford (onboard): Use f:11 at 250.
124:00:56 Cernan (onboard): f:11 at 250?
124:00:57 Stafford (onboard): That's what it says. Now, you've got the - got the basic oblique. It's four at 2 - I can't believe that. Why don't you shoot one f:11 at 2 - When it first comes up, shoot it f:5.6 at 250 and f:8 at 250 and [garble].
124:01:12 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] landmark.
124:01:28 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] I don't know how they expect us to get these targets of opportunity ...
124:01:30 Young: [Garble] on the horizon.
124:01:32 Cernan (onboard): [Garble].
124:01:48 Young (onboard): God Almighty! That scared the shit out of me. Know what it was?
124:01:56 Cernan (onboard): What?
124:02:01 Stafford (onboard): What did you see, babe?
124:02:03 Young (onboard): I had my shoulder down like that, and the sunlight was shining on there, and it looked like the No Attitude light was on.
124:02:12 Stafford (onboard): That's all we need.
124:02:17 Young (onboard): Yes. Come to think of it.
124:02:42 Young (onboard): It's way up there yet, man.
124:02:58 Stafford: Here comes the maria. As you look at the maria there - gosh, it looks flat. And the maria looks to me - now we're just [garble] this area or tan, the new material looks white, kind of a creamy white. And you've got the black stuff in [garble] volcano's again. And out there, it's more of a brown to me on that maria material, right? What do you think?
124:03:27 Young/Cernan (onboard): [Garble] color.
124:03:30 Stafford (onboard): Hell, yes. It's got colors to it but definite shades of brown. And the new stuff is - oh, white, a pumice white.
124:03:54 Cernan (onboard): You guys [garble].
124:03:57 Young (onboard): Huh?
124:03:58 Stafford (onboard): José is moving around, getting some exercise.
124:04:02 Young (onboard): My isometrics.
124:04:04 Stafford (onboard): We're going to hit the maria, baby.
124:04:06 Young (onboard): No shit.
124:04:08 Stafford (onboard): Here comes the maria.
124:04:11 Cernan (onboard): What time's that Earth coming up?
124:04:17 Stafford (onboard): Boy, oh, boy. Sun's so bright, I can't - It's 24:04. Get it - here he comes, he...
124:04:29 Young (onboard): [Garble] you don't.
124:04:31 Stafford (onboard): You better. We can get him next time. a se - next time, try to get a sequence on him too. Just a couple of short sequences.
124:04:51 Young (onboard): You missed him? You missed him? Know how I could tell he was coming? Because I heard the acquisition.
124:05:01 Cernan (onboard): Yes.
124:05:03 Stafford (onboard): Just take a couple in color, OK. F-1.
124:05:08 Young (onboard): Yes.
124:05:09 Stafford (onboard): At 124...

124:05:09 Duke: Hello, Apollo 10. This is Houston. We're standing by. Over.
124:05:14 Stafford: Roger, Apollo 10. Houston, we're doing landmark tracking, and we're coming up to landmark F-1.
124:05:23 Duke: Roger, 10. Good afternoon, you guys. Just wanted to congratulate you on a great day yesterday. I didn't get a chance to do it yesterday. It was a beautiful show.
124:05:35 Stafford: OK. Thanks a lot, Charlie. You on the ground really came through coordinating those vehicles together. You must have had a heck of a load on your shoulders. But boy, it was fantastic, and we sure appreciate it.
124:05:45 Duke: We've had a lot of fun, Tom.
124:05:47 Young: [Garble] I could feel the tension down there [garble].
124:05:50 Duke: Say again, John.
124:05:52 Young: I could feel - I could feel the tension down there all the way up here.
124:05:56 Stafford (onboard): OK, you roll 10 degrees to the...
124:05:57 Duke: We were a little tight at times, but you guys did a great job. We'll let you get back to work now. Out.
124:06:06 Stafford: Roger. Thank you. Out.
Comm break.
124:06:05 Stafford (onboard): OK. What - Oops - Excuse me. Okay. OK; 08:03. John. [Garble] that time. You've got 2 minutes.
124:06:15 Young (onboard): Yes, well, this damn thing. Could you pitch up just a hair?
124:06:19 Stafford: Yes, sorry.
124:06:22 Young (onboard): Maybe about 10 degrees.
124:06:24 Stafford (onboard): Coming to you. babe.
124:06:40 Stafford (onboard): Oh. I see what you're shooting at. It's a bright one, isn't it?
124:06:44 Young (onboard): Yes.
124:07:12 Stafford (onboard): You got about a minute to go on it. babe.
124:07:15 Young (onboard): Alright.
124:08:03 Stafford (onboard): OK; we should be there right now. John.
124:08:22 Young (onboard): Yes.
124:08:33 Young (onboard): I want to stay on this one. OK.
124:08:37 Stafford (onboard): Ready.
124:08:38 Young (onboard): Yes.
124:08:39 Stafford (onboard): Tell we when.
124:08:40 Young (onboard): There was one. You got about 5 seconds on one.
124:08:44 Stafford (onboard): Okay. 10. 15. 20, 25. There's two. 20, 25. Three. 5, 10, 15.
124:09:47 Young (onboard): Far as I could do it, Tom.
124:09:48 Stafford (onboard): 20. Far as you could do it, huh?
124:09:50 Young (onboard): Yes. I got a little late on that one.
124:09:53 Stafford (onboard): Got three points on that one.
124:09:54 Young (onboard): Got five.
124:10:00 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] went bang, bang, bang, bang, bang [garble].
124:10:04 Young (onboard): No, I got five.
124:10:05 Stafford (onboard): Yes, you got five.
124:10:06 Young (onboard): Yes.
124:10:07 Stafford (onboard): OK.
124:10:17 Stafford (onboard): OK. Doing good there, John. The last one is our good old friend 130, and that shouldn't be any sweat for you. And half of - about half of this is over.
124:10:28 Cernan (onboard): Oh! Oh, boy.
124:10:45 Young (onboard): It makes me feel good, no matter what's on there (laughter).
124:11:00 Cernan (onboard): You must be reading about 30 - 41 minutes.
124:11:11 Stafford (onboard): Huh? 41 minutes.
124:11:40 Young (onboard): Jesus Christ.
124:11:44 Stafford (onboard): Do you want to copy that down?
124:11:45 Young (onboard): Look - look at that world, will you?
124:11:47 Stafford (onboard): Do you want to copy that down John? Huh?
124:11:50 Young (onboard): I got it.
124:11:53 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] where do you get the [garble]?
124:11:56 Stafford (onboard): Hold it.
124:12:13 Stafford (onboard): What does that mean?
124:12:14 Young (onboard): What does what mean? What I just said?
124:12:18 Stafford (onboard): Yes.
124:12:19 Young (onboard): Well, it says that - the altitude keeps changing.
124:12:28 Stafford (onboard): Are those in nautical miles?
124:12:31 Young (onboard): Yes.
124:12:32 Stafford (onboard): Oh shit.
124:12:33 Young (onboard): It says the direction - the distance keeps changing. It says that if I mark it on the same point everytime - The real key to this - I know these two - these two here were on the same place.
124:12:45 Stafford (onboard): Yes.
124:12:47 Young (onboard): These two here, I'm not 100 percent sure of. So, we'll have to - But those two on the [garble].
Young is not confident that he Marked on the same landmark on the last two targets, compared to previous revs.
124:12:51 Stafford: You [garble] correlation.
124:12:52 Young (onboard): Those two - they're OK. Man, coming around on the front side, these things here start getting farther and farther away from each other.
124:13:01 Cernan (onboard): Want to take a look at North and South America from a quarter of a million miles?
124:13:09 Stafford (onboard): OK. Let's see. Now what about the - the 130?
124:13:15 Young (onboard): What about that.
124:13:20 Stafford (onboard): That's a plus 27. Oh, hell. You've got 14 minutes. Hey, do you - Let's see, that is North 12 miles. Do you want to roll - keep that right roll on?
124:13:28 Young (onboard): Just keep the right roll on. Yes. Hold what you got. In fact, you can take it out. You can take it out - about 5 degrees of it, if you will. That last one was a little too...
124:13:39 Stafford (onboard): Too much?
124:13:40 Young (onboard): ...too far gone.
124:13:57 Stafford (onboard): OK. That's 44 minutes.
124:14:29 Young (onboard): 44 minutes is when it is, huh?
124:14:32 Stafford (onboard): Huh?
124:14:33 Young (onboard): The next one's at 44 minutes?
124:14:34 Stafford (onboard): No, I was just using up my correlation chart. The next one is at 27:28 to acquire; 13 minutes.
124:14:43 Cernan (onboard): Is it 4 o'clock in the afternoon? What time did we get up this morning?
124:14:48 Stafford (onboard): Shit, I don't know. When I woke up, you were taking pictures.
124:14:53 Young (onboard): Oh.
124:14:54 Stafford (onboard): I figured it was time to get up.
124:15:05 Stafford (onboard): Oh, goodness. Our tape recorder's running, is it?
124:15:17 Young (onboard): Yes. I'm sure it's - no, not now.
124:15:19 Cernan (onboard): Yes, it is.
124:15:20 Young (onboard): On the front side?
124:15:22 Cernan (onboard): Yes, they'll probably want to record it over - the stuff we're doing. I didn't knew it was on.
124:15:29 Stafford (onboard): I think they want it running while we take these ones and mark tracks. We're coming over into Mr. Smyth's Sea, here.
124:15:37 Young (onboard): OK. What time is it?
124:15:40 Stafford (onboard): It's at - Where, at Smyth's Sea?
124:15:43 Young (onboard): What time did the 44 come on? What time did 89 come on?
124:15:47 Cernan (onboard): We may be past Smyth's Sea and be coming into the Sea of Fertility. I think. 48 minutes coming in. [Garble].
124:15:54 Stafford (onboard): [Garble].
124:15:58 Cernan (onboard): Neper is abeam us right here.
124:15:59 Stafford (onboard): Yes. Right. right. right. right.
124:16:01 Cernan (onboard): I think we're counting up - I don't know. What time have you got here, babe?
124:16:03 Young (onboard): [Garble].
124:16:06 Stafford (onboard): That's Langrenus over there.
124:16:12 Cernan (onboard): Yes. That's it. We're coming up on...
124:16:15 Stafford (onboard): That's got to be Langrenus over there; that big bear.
124:16:17 Cernan (onboard): Yes. That is Langrenus.

124:16:31 Young (onboard): You know. They really don't care where the landmark is, I don't think. What they're doing is, they're uplinking up their best vector two revs ahead - after each pass, see? And then, when we come around the next pass and mark on it, they see how much it's off.
124:16:47 Stafford (onboard): Yes.
124:16:48 Young (onboard): That's to get their empirical corrections for site 130 I don't know if that will work or not. It may work.
124:17:01 Young (onboard): What time is that site 130?
124:17:10 Stafford (onboard): 124:27:28. 10 minutes.
124:17:15 Young (onboard): 10 minutes.
124:17:21 Stafford (onboard): There's Messier laid out ahead. That maria is just as flat and level.
124:17:34 Young (onboard): That's what I've always said.
124:18:02 Young (onboard): Yes. Messier.
124:18:10 Stafford (onboard): Yes.
124:18:27 Stafford (onboard): Taruntius H and G. And little old Taruntius B and K.
AS10-32-4683 - Taruntius H, K and P - Image by NASA/ASU.
124:18:35 Cernan (onboard): What rev we on?
124:18:38 Stafford (onboard): You got to have [garble] Oh. Would you believe 25? Been up here over 2 days.
124:19:02 Young (onboard): Huh?
124:19:06 Stafford (onboard): Yes. I got you 5 degrees. What was your old [garble]?
124:19:18 Stafford (onboard): I got you 5 degrees roll for 130.
124:19:08 Young (onboard): Thank you.
124:19:18 Stafford (onboard): There's old Secchi. Look at those rays from Messier B go out laterally.
AS10-32-4691 - Secchi and Mount Marilyn - Image by NASA/ASU.
124:19:25 Cernan (onboard): Yes. I was looking at those...
124:19:26 Stafford (onboard): And Messier...
124:19:27 Cernan (onboard): ...left and right, and...
124:19:28 Stafford (onboard): ...Messier...
124:19:29 Cernan (onboard): ...then straight down the tube.
124:19:30 Stafford (onboard): Yes.
124:19:31 Cernan (onboard): I was looking at that earlier, Tom.
124:19:32 Stafford (onboard): And Messier...
124:19:33 Cernan (onboard): I want to shoot a picture of that. I saw that backwards.
124:19:34 Stafford (onboard): ...and Messier A just goes out one way. They aren't - I'll tell you why it does. There was an old crater when Messier came hauling ass in there and hit. And so, down at the lower extremity when the ejecta got put out. it didn't have the higher rim to follow; you can see what happened. You see that old crater out there? On the other side?
124:19:51 Cernan (onboard): Yes. but look at it backwards and then you'll revise your - I don't know.
124:19:54 Stafford: Look. You can see that Messier A there is...
124:19:58 Young (onboard): Can you pitch up about 10 degrees Tom?
124:20:00 Stafford (onboard): Yes. Messier A is about - is quite a bit younger than the other one. You can see an old crater in there it where it came bombing in. And when he hit on the side of the old one, the ejecta - look at look how ramped the sides are on it. But that Messier - Messier, the main one, that's a weird looking one.
124:20:39 Stafford (onboard): OK. Why don't you get a picture of crater Weatherford this time, Gene-o? It's right there by Mount Marilyn, over on the right. OK?
AS10-32-4700 - Mount Marilyn with the ancient crater unofficially named Weatherford by the Apollo 10 crew, just beyond it - Image by NASA/ASU.
124:21:12 Stafford (onboard): Down in between there and Taruntius.
124:21:46 Young (onboard): Oh, my eyeballs.
124:21:49 Stafford (onboard): Yes. Look, when you start to get tired, you can knock it off, John.
124:21:51 Young (onboard): I ain't going to do that.
Young is very aware of how important the landmark tracking is, especially on target 130 which is very close to the planned LS-2 landing site for Apollo 11.
124:21:54 Stafford (onboard): Is that high enough for you as far as...
124:21:56 Young (onboard): Yes, this is great.
124:21:57 Stafford (onboard): Well, that's about...
124:21:58 Young (onboard): We're about there.
124:22:01 Stafford (onboard): Well, we got a ways to go. Our old friend Maskelyne is just coming up over there.
AS10-32-4708 - Maskelyne near the horizon - Image by NASA/ASU.
124:22:55 Stafford (onboard): Censorinus A really stands up. We got a ways to go. John. Just sit back and relax, shit, and I'll lead you into it. I got Maskelyne. Maskelyne - Oh, there the B. The B really stands up over there. Now, if Neil and those boys come in on - And there's a big the real key-in is going to be when they pitch up; there's Censorinus, going to be right there in front of them.
124:23:24 Young (onboard): Yes.
124:23:25 Stafford (onboard): Censorinus A; it's a beautiful checkmark.
124:23:28 Young (onboard): Let's see - It just sort of looks brownish to me, Tom. I must be crazy, but it does.
124:23:32 Stafford (onboard): It's brown and tan. Under - way early in the morning, in certain shades of light - it looks gray; but most of the time, it's brown and tan - light brown and tan.
124:23:42 Young (onboard): Yes.
124:23:43 Stafford (onboard): And then the new stuff, where it hits it, it looks like gypsum. You know gypsum?
124:23:47 Young (onboard): Yes. It looks just like gypsum.
124:23:49 Stafford (onboard): Yes.
124:23:55 Stafford: OK, Houston. Apollo 10. We're coming up on Censorinus and we have Maskelyne, Maskelyne B, and 130 up ahead; and we'll call you after we finish the track on that. Over.
124:24:06 Duke: Roger, 10. We're standing by. We're tracking you along.
Comm break.
124:24:32 Stafford (onboard): Okay, babe. 21:23.
124:25:00 Stafford (onboard): Let me look at the monocular for a minute, please.
124:25:36 Stafford (onboard): I would say that Censorinus is definitely a little old impacto crater.
124:25:41 Young (onboard): Man, I wouldn't want to tangle with that moose.
124:25:44 Cernan (onboard): Boy, you can see Highway I running right all the way - on the left - all the way up there already. Right beyond Moltke, to the left there.
124:25:50 Young (onboard): Yes.
124:25:54 Stafford (onboard): Just let's see where U.S. 1 stops up here. Here's the monocular if you want it.
124:26:09 Cernan (onboard): I'm going to put this thing on here with the - with the 80-millimeter lens - unless you just let it run at 1 frame [garble] every 20 seconds, if you go [garble] attitude. [Garble].
124:26:23 Stafford (onboard): Yes. Sure does. OK, let me know when, old buddy.
124:26:32 Young (onboard): OK. What time are we supposed to start taking marks?
124:26:42 Stafford (onboard): Take marks at 27 - 29. See, and you won't see it for a while yet.
124:26:50 Young (onboard): Now I got - I've got it up ahead here, but I don't think - I got Duke Island and Boot Hill. And Maskelyne and Maskelyne B, lead in. Snake Eyes Rille.
124:27:19 Stafford (onboard): U.S.1 just seems to kind of die out down there.
124:27:22 Young (onboard): Yes. They must have ran out of money before they finished building it.
124:27:55 Stafford (onboard): OK, at 29 minutes. You've got 1, minute to go, John. I got the thing out there.
124:28:26 Young (onboard): Not bad, but it's not on - it - it's close. Tracking pretty good. Shit.
124:28:37 Stafford (onboard): What happened?
124:28:40 Young (onboard): I'm floating allover the goddam place and I should be tracking landmarks. Say when.
124:28:49 Stafford (onboard): You're just about there. Any time now, here, but go ahead if you got it.
124:28:54 Young (onboard): I got it.
124:28:55 Stafford (onboard): Mark.
124:28:56 Stafford (onboard): One mark.
124:29:00 Young (onboard): How many?
124:29:02 Stafford (onboard): Five.
124:29:03 Young (onboard): OK.
124:29:10 Stafford (onboard): 15, 20, 25. 5, 10, 15. 20, 25. That's three. And 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. That's four.

124:30:13 Cernan (onboard): Our radiators are just barely hacking the program.
124:30:16 Stafford (onboard): 5...
124:30:17 Young (onboard): Barely is good enough.
124:30:21 Stafford (onboard): - - 10, 15, 20, 25. You got it. That's five.
124:30:39 Young (onboard): Yes.
124:30:45 Stafford (onboard): Gene-o, do you want to copy the updates this time, for this stuff?
124:30:48 Cernan (onboard): Yes. And hold.
124:30:50 Stafford (onboard): OK. I'll copy this down.
124:30:56 Stafford: OK. Houston, Charlie Brown. We finished tracking 130. Over.
124:31:02 Duke: Roger. We copy, 10.

124:31:16 Stafford (onboard): That it?
124:31:17 Young (onboard): No, that's - yes, that's the one we put in there.
124:31:20 Stafford (onboard): What was it?
124:31:22 Young (onboard): That's what we put in there.
124:31:24 Stafford (onboard): OK. I'm sorry.
124:31:39 Stafford (onboard): We can copy these numbers down here.
124:31:45 Cernan (onboard): Copy these down from where?
124:31:48 Stafford (onboard): DSKY in just a minute.

124:32:37 Young: You got the data, Charlie?
124:32:42 Duke: That's affirmative, John. We got it all. Over.
124:32:52 Young: Houston, Apollo 10. Did you get the data? Over.
124:32:55 Duke: Roger. 10, we got the data. Over.
124:33:01 Young: OK.
124:33:05 Cernan (onboard): [Garble].
124:33:33 Young (onboard): [Garble] feel to live like a do-nothing guy.
124:33:34 Duke: 10, Houston. How did F-1 look in the sextant this time?
124:33:41 Young: It looked OK in the telescope this time.
124:33:45 Stafford (onboard): Want the numbers to copy, John?
124:33:46 Duke: OK.
124:33:47 Young (onboard): Yes.
124:33:48 Stafford (onboard): Plus 01378?
124:33:50 Young (onboard): Yes.
124:33:52 Stafford (onboard): Plus 11815?
124:33:55 Young (onboard): Yes.
124:33:56 Cernan (onboard): Plus 013...
124:33:57 Stafford (onboard): 78. Plus 11815, minus 00161.
124:34:06 Young (onboard): Yes.
124:34:35 Young (onboard): God damn. Sometimes I look at these things; they're funny and they look like their holes are hills.
124:34:40 Stafford (onboard): Yes. Let me look - I need to pitch around to 292 - 092 again - but I don't know when though.
The CSM is to be manoeuvred to an attitude that will allow High Gain Antenna lock on with MSFN. That should have been at approximately 124:32:XX.

That's the end of the tape, and we're live now.
124:35:50 Stafford: Hello, Houston. Apollo 10.
124:35:55 Duke: Go ahead, 10. Over.
124:35:58 Stafford: I'm going to OK. I'm going to pitch around to the 092 attitude, and we'll get you some High Gain then. Over.
124:36:03 Duke: Roger, 10.
124:36:13 Young: Houston, this is 10. Summary of the last four landmarks: CP-1 - I'm not sure, reviewing it in my mind, whether I tracked the same CP-1 on the first one as I did on the second one. CP-2, I'm sure I've got the right one; F-1 I'm sure is the right one, and 130 I'm sure is right.
124:36:40 Duke: Roger, John. We copy. Maybe not sure on CP-1, the rest are the same.
124:36:49 Young: Yes, And CP-2 I did with the sextant, CP-1 and 2 were with the sextant, F-1 was with the telescope, 130 was with the sextant, and I'm going back to the telescope on CP-1.
124:37:06 Duke: Roger.
124:37:08 Young: And probably CP-2.
124:37:10 Duke: Roger. We copy, John. Next rev you're going to try the telescope on CP-1, 2, and F-1 and use the sextant on 130.
124:37:21 Young: Roger. And I may not do that. It depends on whether I can identify it in the sextant or not, once I get it in the scope.
124:37:28 Duke: Roger. We copy. How's the old eyeball holding out?
124:37:32 Young: Eyeball's OK. I just keep - I just keep - It's a question of washout and things like that. At different inclination angles when you're passing over it, these little things look different; especially in that sextant where you've got these two landmark line of sights fighting. These two lines of sights are sort of in competition with each other.
124:37:56 Duke: Roger.
124:37:58 Young: 130's been good, though. 130s been real good.
124:38:04 Duke: Roger. Thanks a lot. Out.
124:38:16 Duke: 10, Houston. About 15 minutes before LOS. We'll have a little critique when we look at the data, and we'll talk to you a little bit more then about it. Over.
124:38:30 Young: Roger.
124:38:42 Duke: Hello, 10. Houston. We'd like you to go to P00 and Accept. We've got a state vector for you. Over.
124:38:53 Stafford: You're in Accept. Go.
124:38:56 Duke: Roger. And, 10, if you're ready to copy now, we got a TEI-26 PAD for you.
124:39:17 Cernan: Go ahead, Charlie.
124:39:20 Duke: Roger, Gene. TEI-26, SPS/G&N; NA down to Noun 33, then we got 127:39:20.00; Noun 81, plus 3163.8, plus 2 balls 56.0, plus 0160.1; pitch angle is 062, and it's two-jet ullage for 14 seconds. Over.
124:40:06 Cernan: Charlie, we lost you. I picked you up at Noun 81. You'll have to go up through - up to Noun 81 again.
124:40:13 Duke: Roger, 10. Why don't we hold off till we get the High Gain, and we'll be back with you. Over.
124:40:20 Cernan: OK. Fine.
124:41:39 Cernan: Go ahead, Charlie. We got your High Gain now, and [garble].
124:41:45 Duke: Roger, 10. You copy now, Gene? Over.
124:41:51 Cernan: That's affirmative.
124:41:55 Duke: OK. We were NA down to Noun 33. Noun 33 is 127:39:20; plus 3163.8, plus 0056.0, plus 0160.1; and a 062 on the pitch angle, two jets ullage for 14 seconds. Over.
124:42:31 Cernan: OK. I got TEI-26, SPS/G&N; Noun's 47 and 48 are NA, 33 is 127:39:20.00; plus 3163.8, plus 0056.0, plus 0160.1. Pitch is 062 and two jets for 14 seconds.
The TEI-26 PAD is interpreted as follows:
Purpose: The PAD is a revised version for an emergency burn to return to Earth at the end of Rev 26.
Systems: The burn would be made using the SPS engine, under the control of the Guidance and Navigation system.
Vehicle weight (Noun 47): N/A
Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48): N/A
Time of ignition (Noun 33): 127 hours, 39 minutes, 20.00 seconds.
Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s): X, +3163.8 (964.3); Y, +0056.0 (17.1); Z,+0160.1 (48.8). The large positive number in the X direction implies a large prograde component, essentially adding to their orbital velocity, exactly what would be expected from an escape manoeuvre.
Spacecraft attitude (IMU angles): Roll, NA; Pitch, 6.2°.
An additional note is that an RCS jet ullage burn should last for 14 seconds. All the subsequent items on the form are not applicable to this manoeuvre.
124:42:53 Duke: Roger. That's a good readback, 10. And we have a Rev-26 update for you. Tracking in the map update if you're ready to copy that now.
124:43:25 Cernan: OK. Go ahead, Charlie.
124:43:28 Duke: OK. We got the state vector in, 10, you can go back to Block. OK. The map update for 26 coming at you: 125:16:41, 125:28:00, 126:02:51. OK. For the CP-1, starting with T1: 125:36:38, 125:39:38, 000, 052, 000, north of track 14, 12, 41. Going to CP-2 now. And starting with T1: 125:52:00, 125:53:42, 000, 007, 000, north of track 12, 4, 43. You with me?
124:45:24 Cernan: Go ahead, Charlie.
124:45:26 Duke: OK. F-1: T1 time, 126:04:46, 126:06:29, 000, 330, 000, north of track 10, 14, 41. 130 OK, T1 for 130: 126:25:53, 126:27:25, 000, 267, 000, north 12, 12, 40. And that's all of PAD, Standing by for your readback.

124:48:33 Duke: OK, 10. That's a good readback, Gene-o. Out.
124:48:41 Cernan: OK, Charlie. From what we saw a little while ago, it looks like the Sun might be shining down there.
124:48:48 Duke: Yes. We've got a big growler coming up just north of the site here. Since I came in, it might be raining out there.
124:49:03 Cernan: OK. That was with the naked eye, from a quarter-million miles away.
124:49:17 Duke: Your friendly geologist, Jack, just advised me that he just came in, and summer has really arrived at Houston, and it is clear and hot.
124:49:29 Cernan: Very good.
Comm break.
124:54:44 Stafford: Hello, Houston. Apollo 10.
124:54:51 Duke: Go ahead, 10. Over.
124:54:54 Stafford: OK. We are looking ahead of you. We've got this rev of landmark tracking and it calls for a TV pass. And - I tell you right - I'd like to show you this moonscape out here. It's really - we think we've got some definition of the color out there: about being in the shade of light brown and light tan and it's gray right near the sunset; an early sunrise and also the new craters look like a gypsum, more of a whitish, chalky - things, but after 130 there is not much light left. An ideal thing would be maybe right near the end of the rest period just give you a big panoramic sweep coming in through there. How would that be? Over.
124:55:37 Duke: Roger. That sounds good to us, 10. We understand that you would like to skip the regular TV at 126:20 and then schedule it in at the end of the rest period. Over.
124:55:51 Stafford: Yes, That's right. By the time we do that, you have to link us a state vector, John does an IMU, and we come around and do one more rev of landmark tracking. It's pretty crowded, plus I don't think we'd have too much to show you. We've got to get squared away for the landmark tracking again, but the way that the Sun is now, out on that maria area there and everything, it is really beautiful and I think it would be lots better if you could figure out an angle where we could get High Gain, and we could be looking backwards. Unless we progress forwards, look back. Kind of show you the whole zone. Or we could go forwards so you can get a High Gain angle during that rest period. We could take about 15 or 20 minutes in there without any problem and show it to you. Over.
124:56:34 Duke: Roger, 10. We can come up with that for you. Do want us to schedule this at the beginning of the rest period or right at the end, Tom?
124:56:48 Stafford: Stand by, Charlie.
124:56:54 Duke: It looks like to me - 10, it looks like to me the best time would probably be at the end of the rest period. As you begin your rest period, you are already in darkness, starting Rev-28. We could probably do it at the end of your rest period. Oh, at about 131:30 or thereabouts. Over.
124:57:17 Stafford: Yes. I - We're just looking ahead here and this looks real good, Charlie. In other words, when we come around at about 131, say 30 or so, give us the angles and we've got some beautiful panoramic views. If we can be looking out obliquely ahead down at about 15 to 20 degrees, and looking ahead with the Sun to our back there you should get a fantastic view of the whole maria area. It's really beautiful. And we could show that on TV. At least so far, the colors have been coming through good; show you what we mean by color up here. Over.
124:57:52 Duke: Roger. Would you like to combine it with the oblique strip photography of Landing Site 3? Over.
124:58:04 Stafford: Yes. That would be OK. Be fine.
124:58:08 Duke: Roger. I think we are pretty well squared away on that, Tom. We'll give you some - We'll look at it for a little bit longer, and we can come up with an attitude for High Gain and TV, and allow you to get your oblique strip in there, and we'll have it for you in a little while. Over.
124:58:28 Stafford: OK. Thank you, Charlie.

125:03:41 Duke: Hello, Apollo 10. Houston. Over.
125:03:47 Stafford: Go ahead.
125:03:49 Duke: OK, Tom. We've got a little critique on your Rev-25 tracking for John. On Site 130, it appeared that he started about 50 seconds early. The spacing was good, but the geometry was not quite as good as we'd like it; and if we could just move that up 50 seconds, we'd appreciate it. I'll repeat, though, that - Go ahead, John.
125:04:21 Stafford: Go, go. We're listening to you; John is busy. Go ahead.
125:04:27 Duke: OK. The spacing was real good on the marks but the geometry wasn't quite as good as they liked it, so they just wanted to pass on that remark. On F-1, the mark spacing was excellent and we started right on time. We only got four marks recorded and it appeared that we were in just - stand by. Roger. It appeared that on F-1, that we initially were just in attitude hold and we ran out of trunnion before we got all the marks in, but the spacing was real good. Over.
125:05:08 Stafford: OK. OK, Houston. We started the marks on 130 right on the time that - we thought, right on the time sequence that you passed up to us. Over.
125:05:30 Duke: Stand by one.
125:05:43 Duke: 10, Houston. The experts here were saying that the T2 time, the mark should be started about 30 to 40 seconds after the T2 time. Over.
125:05:59 Stafford: OK. All right. We'll start them 30 to 40 seconds after T2.
125:06:06 Duke: Roger. And Tom, we're going to have Goldstone up for you on the TV at about 132, and we'll have the 210[-foot] dish. It looks like we're going to be in good shape for the oblique and the TV, and we'll get all the info up to you next rev. Over.
125:06:28 Stafford: OK. Sounds real great, Charlie. Thank you.
125:06:31 Duke: Roger. And we got 10 minutes to LOS. We'll see you next rev at 126:02, and we're looking good going over the hill. The fuel cell Everything is looking good. Over.
125:06:52 Stafford: OK. Real fine. Thanks a lot, Charlie.

125:07:36 Stafford: Houston, this is 10. On that TV pass, we'd like the obliques, if we could get into some attitude where we wouldn't have to be upside down, like maybe if we yawed right or pitched looking out the side window. Over.
125:07:51 Duke: Roger. Stand by on that one, Tom. Over.
125:07:57 Stafford: OK.
125:08:29 Duke: Hello, 10, Houston. We have your request, and we'll work it out on the back side. And we'll have it for you next AOS. Over.
125:08:42 Stafford: OK. Real fine, Charlie. Thank you a lot. It looks like the old orbit here is being torqued around just like predicted. Apogee is getting higher and perigee is getting lower. Over.
125:08:50 Duke: Yes. Old FIDO's been showing me what the potential does to you guys there. And it's a really weird looking thing there. It's as predicted, though. I guess [garble] - Oh, go ahead.
125:09:07 Young: No, I was just going to say. We've been noticing, we expected it but right there we're in the 67.3 by 54.7. Looks like total energy is conserved, but it's really changing the APS [garble]. Over.
125:09:21 Duke: Roger. That's just about what we have you in. We agree with all those comments. Over.
125:09:28 Stafford: Roger.
Comm break.
125:14:18 Duke: Hello, 10. Houston. Two minutes to LOS. You're looking great going over the hill. Over.
125:14:46 Young: OK, Charlie. Thanks a lot.
This is Apollo Control at 125 hours, 16 minutes. We've lost the signal from Apollo 10. We're showing an orbit here now of 67.3 by 54.4 nautical miles [124.6 by 100.7 km]. The previous revolution we were reading 67.1 by 54.7 [124.3 by 101.3 km]. This was a busy pass as far as the crew was concerned doing a lot of landmark tracking. We updated the crew on times and attitudes for control points and landmarks and upcoming revolutions. As you heard the discussion, the regularly scheduled TV pass which had been scheduled for an elapsed time of 126 hours, 20 minutes has been scrubbed and in its place we'll be a television pass beginning at Goldstone acquisition at 132 hours. At that time we'll be in revolution number 29. We have acquisition again of Apollo 10 at 126 hours, 2 minutes, 51 seconds. This is Mission Control, Houston.
125:16:22 Stafford (onboard): We still got 15 minutes.
125:16:24 Cernan (onboard): No. you got more than that - you got 20 minutes.
125:16:30 Young (onboard): [Garble].
125:16:31 Stafford (onboard): OK, as the experts say, [garble] when we get T2 [garble]. Wait 35 to 40 seconds past the hour.
125:16:46 Stafford (onboard): They said your marking schedules were real good. That's the only thing you did as far as the [garble].
125:16:57 Cernan (onboard): How far?
125:17:02 Young (onboard): OK, [garble] T.P. [garble].
125:17:07 Stafford (onboard): OK. Let me know. [Garble].
125:17:31 Stafford (onboard): [Laughter.]
125:17:34 Young (onboard): How did you make out?
125:17:44 Young (onboard): What you doing with it?
125:18:18 Stafford (onboard): Say what?
125:18:20 Cernan (onboard): [Garble].
125:18:26 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] the TV monitor [garble] lost the optics off the [garble].
125:19:04 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] it I knew that a long time ago.
125:19:30 Cernan (onboard): That's just silly. I can't smell a thing, but I couldn't smell it [garble] time either.
125:19:34 Stafford (onboard): I don't know whether you could smell that stuff I put on my nose, I can't smell anything but that [garble].
125:19:50 Stafford (onboard): If you look to the right there, you'll see that corona. That's what we thought was the airglow, old buddy. Look - look at that thing [garble] look out straight ahead - Turn your lights down. See how it looks like an airglow out there? Straight ahead, but how it [garble] on the other side. Well, that's the solar corona.
125:20:10 Cernan (onboard): Yes, that's right.
125:20:11 Stafford (onboard): [Garble].
125:20:13 Cernan (onboard): Yes, that's what [garble].
125:22:09 Cernan (onboard): Too bad we had to jettison that LM in the Sun. I would have liked to have seen what that hatch looked like.
125:22:15 Young (onboard): Wasn't that typical? Nobody knows how that [garble].
125:22:19 Stafford (onboard): I thought we had it all...
125:22:22 Young (onboard): [Garble] was blowing up.
125:22:24 Stafford (onboard): (Laughter)
125:22:25 Young (onboard): [Garble] that's what it looked like to me.
125:22:30 Stafford (onboard): (Laughter) I had a beautiful view. There was a damn - there was the biggest shitting [garble] you've ever seen against the window (laughter).
125:22:36 Cernan (onboard): Well, I - I admit...
125:22:37 Young (onboard): (Laughter) [Garble] a big explosion [garble] this guy, he's got his [garble] full of [garble] It pitched off and shot straight out and right up to the Sun [garble] right over the hill [garble].
125:22:48 Stafford (onboard): [Garble].
Planned spacecraft attitudes during rev 26.
125:23:-- BEGIN LUNAR REV 26
125:23:02 Young (onboard): [Garble].
125:23:04 Stafford (onboard): Well, José; you've still got time for it.
125:23:08 Young (onboard): Yes, [garble].
125:23:11 Stafford (onboard): 36, 37. You've got about 12 - 13 minutes [garble].
125:23:17 Young (onboard): [Garble].
125:23:28 Young (onboard): Yes, but I don't know if we'll get to it. You see, the thing about it is, most people go - probably when they go to the bathroom, the [garble] goes over to the damn john at the same time.
125:23:49 Stafford (onboard): If they put pressure down in, it would probably carry it.
125:23:51 Young (onboard): Sure, it's bound to...
125:23:52 Stafford (onboard): [Laughter.] Have you got the turd?
125:23:53 Young (onboard): ...[garble] the stuff. You got a big mess. People are mad at you.
125:23:58 Stafford (onboard): [Laughter.]
125:24:03 Young (onboard): And I don't blame them. I don't care.
125:24:14 Stafford (onboard): [Laughter.] Dad gum. I still think it's funny, putting that load in [garble]. Hey, Joe. You ought to get a little award from the [garble] for that one.
125:24:25 Cernan (onboard): Yes. First crap around the Sun.
125:24:27 Stafford (onboard): [Laughter.]
125:24:31 Cernan (onboard): By God; the [garble] would be the first time - the first free crap in space.
125:24:36 Young (onboard): Yes. I bet they would; I bet SAI, SA - SIA [garble] they [garble].
125:24:41 Cernan (onboard): World side [garble]. (Laughter)
125:24:43 Stafford (onboard): [Laughter.]
125:24:44 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] inside the [garble], anyway.
125:24:53 Stafford (onboard): If you lived a few months like this, you'd be [garble].
125:25:01 Young (onboard): It's all on the tape, too. [Garble].
125:25:04 Stafford (onboard): Yes. OK, John. [Garble] be here shortly.
125:25:36 Young (onboard): OK, B-1, 875, [garble].
125:26:04 Young (onboard): Yes. It was obvious to me that we weren't - we were...
125:26:11 Stafford (onboard): Go ahead. What did you say, John?
125:26:16 Young (onboard): It was obvious to me that we probably weren't getting there as quick as we should.
125:26:26 Young (onboard): The Sun must be getting [garble] here. Oh, shit. We're way ahead, anyway. What time does it come up?
125:26:41 Stafford (onboard): 125:36:38.
125:26:47 Young (onboard): I don't understand what we got here.
125:26:52 Stafford (onboard): About 150 west keep [garble] on west, doesn't it?
125:26:56 Young (onboard): Yes. As far as [garble] time.
125:27:03 Stafford (onboard): That comes up at 125:28.
125:28:00 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] still laughing about [garble]. You know, I bet what happened; when the hatch was sealed and not vented, when you fired the pyro's...
125:28:14 Young (onboard): Yes.
125:28:15 Stafford (onboard): ...that put a shock wave up there and that structure is so damn weak it split some of that structure off it. We separated up here so we were free, but I'll bet that sent a shock right up into Snoopy. It split that structure open. [Garble].
Stafford is referring back to the LM separation that was so violent that it caused the LM upper hatch or vent valve to fail, allowing the LM cabin to depressurize.
125:29:04 Stafford (onboard): Here, I get the 150 west [garble].
125:29:52 Young (onboard): We've got something funny here.
125:29:55 Stafford (onboard): What you got there?
125:29:56 Young (onboard): I don't know.
125:29:58 Stafford (onboard): Got the right landmark?
125:30:09 Stafford (onboard): 875, 85073; yes, that's right.
125:30:33 Young (onboard): OK. I get - The real message there, though, is to hold Orb Rate.
125:30:38 Stafford (onboard): Yes. That's right.
125:30:55 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] up. It should come to [garble].
125:30:58 Young (onboard): That figures.
125:31:07 Cernan (onboard): Here it is.
125:31:54 Stafford (onboard): See, John; 125:36:38.
125:31:59 Young (onboard): A little while yet.
125:32:03 Stafford (onboard): OK. And CP-1 is 14 miles north, so I don't need to do a thing on that, do I?
125:32:09 Young (onboard): No.
125:32:10 Stafford (onboard): I think you did real well.
125:32:26 Young (onboard): Was Chris on the line?
125:32:29 Stafford (onboard): No.
125:32:40 Cernan (onboard): What the hell were they saying about the landmark track? Just that - that they're screwed up?
125:32:44 Stafford (onboard): No, they weren't screwed up.
125:32:47 Young (onboard): They said they were screwed up; they didn't say that we were screwed.
125:33:03 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] freak I made down there in the middle of 225. You're stupid not to do that.
125:33:10 Stafford (onboard): Yes. Stuff like that shines out better than the one on the ridge. Doesn't it, babe?
125:33:13 Young (onboard): Hell, yes.
125:34:35 Cernan (onboard): Has the Sun come up yet?
125:34:36 Stafford (onboard): Oh, yes. You can't see it down there?
125:34:39 Young (onboard): [Garble] freaking off this [garble].
125:34:56 Cernan (onboard): Well, I won't see it until they decide to look into the sunlight.
125:35:42 Stafford (onboard): OK.
125:35:48 Young (onboard): When are we supposed to get this thing?
125:35:51 Stafford (onboard): 130 - 25:36:38. Should be on the horizon for you in about 38 seconds.
125:36:00 Young (onboard): Here comes the Sun.
125:36:10 Stafford (onboard): OK, Gene-o. The Earth is going to come up at 126:02. 02:51 [garble] yaw [garble] good on that. This stuff gives you a headache, doesn't it?
125:36:33 Cernan (onboard): I closed my eyes and dreamed that [garble].
125:36:38 Stafford (onboard): You had a dream last night? (Laughter)
125:36:39 Cernan (onboard): [Garble].
125:36:43 Stafford (onboard): OK.
125:36:44 Young (onboard): He had a dream, huh? [Singing] 'I had a dream, dear; you had one, too.'
125:36:49 Cernan (onboard): Tom, I'd like to change the lenses [garble] on that one.
125:36:53 Stafford (onboard): You what?
125:36:55 Cernan (onboard): I'd like to change [garble].
125:36:58 Stafford (onboard): You want the long lens?
125:37:00 Cernan: Yes, that little lens isn't too good, do you suppose? I'll try it. I'll try it. [Garble] the long one [garble].
125:37:06 Stafford (onboard): Did you take some of the 80, the last [garble]?
125:37:01 Cernan (onboard): [Garble].
125:37:08 Stafford (onboard): Why don't you take some of both? Here, I'll give you both of them. You got the - Right behind your head is a great place to stow it. Let me help John a little more.
125:37:23 Young (onboard): Now I'm starting to get a long sun line. God Almighty, what a place. It's really something. I'll tell you.
125:37:32 Young (onboard): It does.
125:37:34 Stafford (onboard): OK. This is 39:38. So you've got 2 minutes. John.
125:37:37 Young (onboard): OK, coming down.
125:37:41 Stafford (onboard): How's the Orb Rate for you?
125:37:44 Cernan (onboard): [Garble].
125:37:45 Stafford (onboard): Good.
125:37:46 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] film.
125:37:47 Young (onboard): I don't know.
125:38:02 Stafford (onboard): How much of those have we got left? There's not as many in that [garble] I wish I could help you out there, John. OK. Yes, I can see your landmark now. It's coming up there. You've got [crater] 225 right ahead.
125:38:36 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] approximately 10 or 11 minutes. OK, John. You can mark at 39:38, so let's hold off until 40, OK?
125:38:46 Young (onboard): From 39 to 40?
125:38:49 Stafford (onboard): From 38 - from 39:38 until it - let's call it 40; zero zero, you know. OK?
125:38:55 Young (onboard): Don't mark until 40? Until a minute?
125:38:58 Stafford (onboard): Yes. That's 22 seconds later, and they said 35 to 40, so...
125:39:04 Young (onboard): OK. OK.
125:39:24 Stafford (onboard): When you've got that, you can get back here and [garble].
125:39:44 Young (onboard): OK, I've got it.
125:39:45 Stafford (onboard): OK. About another 15 seconds, you can start on it, babe. Got a good Orb Rate going. OK, any time now, go ahead. Tell me when.
125:40:02 Stafford (onboard): Mark?
125:40:04 Young (onboard): Yes.
Crew are marking on landmark CP-1.
125:40:07 Stafford (onboard): 5 seconds. 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. OK, got that one up, too. And 10.
125:40:41 Young (onboard): Tell me what that trunnion angle's getting to be.
125:40:44 Stafford (onboard): 15. I can't see it, babe. 20. 25 - [garble] up...
125:40:55 Young (onboard): We're right in the middle, too. That's perfect.
125:41:03 Stafford (onboard): 10, 15, 20, 25. That's four, right?
125:41:21 Young (onboard): Yes.
125:41:23 Stafford (onboard): 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. Got that number?
125:41:48 Young (onboard): Yes,
125:41:49 Stafford (onboard): Beautiful. John.
125:41:53 Young (onboard): Now, we mark the same one this time as last time. I know that's for sure.
125:42:07 Stafford (onboard): OK. the next one is going to be CP-2. Now that's north, 5 miles. So you want me to roll right 5 degrees, right?
125:42:16 Young (onboard): Yes.
125:43:41 Stafford (onboard): You haven't got the numbers yet, have you? OK. [garble] 125:52:00. You've got 9 minutes [garble].
125:43:51 Young (onboard): OK.
125:44:05 Young (onboard): [Garble] 795, 85057, 67 - Look at how the altitude varies between those two. 67 and 63 - the last two.
125:44:23 Stafford (onboard): OK, let me copy those numbers down, John.
125:44:25 Young (onboard): OK.
125:44:30 Stafford (onboard): Man, you've got that altitude wired. Plus 00795, plus 85057, 00067. Got it, babe.
125:45:04 Cernan (onboard): [Garble].
125:45:15 Stafford (onboard): CP-2, just on the other side of big Florida.
125:45:21 Cernan (onboard): (Cough) I don't have a cold or something...
125:45:36 Young (onboard): Goddam fiber glass. We'll have to take your lungs to Arizona when we get back.
125:45:46 Cernan (onboard): There's that thing that looks like the LM again; it's that damn star. What star is that?
125:45:51 Young (onboard): Star of LM.
125:45:52 Stafford (onboard): That's Snoopy's bottom part, old buddy, I bet.
125:45:55 Cernan (onboard): Huh?
125:45:56 Young (onboard): That's what it is.
125:46:01 Cernan (onboard): You think so?
125:46:03 Stafford (onboard): They had a couple of studies going to see if we were going to collide with it. They said - it could vary between going in front of us and going aft of us.
125:46:08 Cernan (onboard): Let's watch it this time. The last couple of times, I haven't watched it. I know [garble] it does not look like a star to me.
125:46:17 Stafford (onboard): That's something, if you should bump into that...
125:46:18 Cernan (onboard): It's so bright; I don't know how the hell you could see it.
125:46:23 Stafford (onboard): OK. We've got 6 minutes to where he's on the horizon.
125:46:33 Cernan (onboard): Yes, hell; he's in a - he's in a 190, isn't he?
125:46:38 Stafford (onboard): A 190 by...
125:46:39 Cernan (onboard): By 10.
The LM Snoopy descent stage should be an approximately 10 x 190-nautical-mile orbit (18.5 x 352 km).
125:46:40 Stafford (onboard): ...10. See, so he's going back behind us. As he goes around, eventually he'll come back and catch up with us from the front. We'll run into him, see?
125:46:53 Young (onboard): What time is this one?
125:46:55 Stafford (onboard): Is the next one; 52, we look at it, and 50 horizon and 53:42 - Well, you've got about 7 minutes.
125:47:06 Young (onboard): OK.
125:47:28 Young (onboard): Weirdsville. Somebody really didn't like this place because they sure pecked at it. Strange looking craters.
125:47:47 Stafford (onboard): We've got Florida over on the right.
125:47:51 Cernan (onboard): John, [garble].
125:47:54 Stafford (onboard): OK. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
125:47:59 Stafford (onboard): Mark.
125:48:00 Stafford (onboard): 20 minutes.
125:48:14 Young (onboard): You didn't bring any Lomo's over :from that LM, did you?
Lomotil tablets are carried in the onboard medical kit. They are used as an anti-diarrheal remedy.
125:48:18 Stafford (onboard): No, I got some in the med kit.
125:48:21 Young (onboard): [Garble].
125:48:22 Cernan (onboard): [Garble]? No, there he is.
125:48:28 Stafford (onboard): We might be able to scrounge you up one.
125:48:52 Stafford (onboard): OK. Got about 5 minutes to where you first acquire.
125:49:05 Cernan (onboard): You rolled right a little.
125:49:07 Stafford (onboard): Yes, 4 degrees; I'm taking her up to 5 now.
125:49:13 Cernan (onboard): You know. I'll bet that is him. That can't be a star.
125:49:20 Stafford (onboard): The old Moon will get to him before long.,
He won't be there very long.
The variability of the lunar gravitational potential will in time degrade the orbit of the jettisoned LM descent stage, and it will inevitably impact the lunar surface in a few weeks' time.
125:49:29 Cernan (onboard): Did you ever see anything that looked like it was glistening, like Surveyors near landing site 2, Tom?
Surveyor 5 landed not far north of Landing Site 2.
125:49:32 Stafford (onboard): No.
125:49:34 Cernan (onboard): I'm going to look real close this time. I doubt it.
125:49:36 Stafford (onboard): No. OK. You're going to acquire them, John, at 52.
125:49:49 Young (onboard): I am, huh?
125:49:54 Stafford (onboard): You're going to have the chain of craters.
125:49:58 Young (onboard): We're coming up by Florida right now.
125:50:01 Stafford (onboard): Yes.
125:50:02 Cernan (onboard): Man, I'm getting pictures of Florida that just won't quit.
125:50:09 Stafford (onboard): Now, if that isn't tan, I don't know what the hell is.
125:50:12 Young (onboard): Sure as hell. It's tan.
125:50:13 Cernan (onboard): That's tan...
125:50:14 Stafford (onboard): Tan, t-a-n, tan. I couldn't describe it better than tan.
125:50:19 Young (onboard): Tan is beautiful. Tan is beautiful...
125:50:22 Stafford (onboard): And the white stuff looks like gypsum.
125:50:32 Young (onboard): Sure looks like gypsum to me.
125:50:45 Young (onboard): Just looking through these optics, I don't know what color it is. You can't tell [garble]...
125:50:50 Cernan (onboard): Tom, you got your monocular?
125:50:51 Stafford (onboard): Yes, Gene-o.
125:50:52 Cernan (onboard): I want to look at that - see whether I can still see the descent stage or not. That's not a star though, babe.
125:50:59 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] plane [garble]. OK, John. After 104, you go to...
125:51:06 Cernan (onboard): Hey, that's it, babe. You can see the legs.
Cernan has been able to see reflections coming off the LM landing gear through the monocular.
125:51:09 Stafford (onboard): Huh?
125:51:11 Young (onboard): You can?
125:51:12 Stafford (onboard): Oh, shit. You can?
125:51:15 Cernan (onboard): You can see it tumbling, and you can see the legs.
125:51:31 Cernan (onboard): You bet your apple potatoes.
125:51:35 Stafford (onboard): OK.
125:51:43 Cernan (onboard): Very slow tumble.
125:51:41 Young (onboard): What time is this thing?
125:51:48 Stafford (onboard): 52. Right now you should be looking out east on your start - You can start the first mark at 53:42, and then we'll delay 20 seconds after that - that's 54 minutes. You ought to start marking that thing. There's the chain craters.
125:52:02 Cernan (onboard): If you get a chance - probably won't, but if you get a chance, you can see the son of a gun tumble up there.
125:52:01 Stafford (onboard): I know it. I've got to help John [garble] optical [garble]. There's John's little old mark right on the side of that peak. I can really pick out CP-2 for you.
125:52:46 Stafford (onboard): OK. Coming up to 53, but we'll wait until 54 to mark on it, John, alright?
125:52:51 Young (onboard): OK.
125:52:54 Stafford (onboard): And I'll tell you when 54 is, and you can start it anytime then.
125:53:04 Cernan (onboard): I kid you not, babe; that's it.
125:53:06 Stafford (onboard): Shit.
125:53:09 Young (onboard): Do what?
125:53:10 Stafford (onboard): I'm with you.
125:53:11 Cernan (onboard): I kid you not; that's it.
125:53:13 Young (onboard): Get a picture of it with 80 millimeter, black and white? Want a 250 millimeter?
125:53:19 Stafford (onboard): You're at 54.
125:53:23 Young (onboard): Just give me a hack at sunrise.
125:53:26 Stafford (onboard): We're already there.
125:53:28 Young (onboard): [Garble] sunrise [garble].
125:53:30 Stafford (onboard): 26:02:51.
125:53:43 Stafford (onboard): 54. OK, in about 10 seconds, John, you should start marking.
125:53:52 Young (onboard): OK.
125:54:00 Stafford (onboard): Did you mark it?
125:54:02 Young (onboard): Yes,
Now marking on landmark CP-2.
125:54:04 Stafford (onboard): OK.
125:54:09 Young (onboard): This is identical to the spot I marked in last time - identical.
125:54:12 Stafford (onboard): OK, got 15 seconds gone, babe.
125:54:15 Young (onboard): OK.
125:54:19 Stafford (onboard): [Garble] kind of fast.
125:54:21 Cernan (onboard): This is the third time that mother has come up over the horizon.
125:54:23 Stafford (onboard): Yes I see it. OK. 5 gone.
125:54:30 Young (onboard): It's in good shape.
125:54:36 Stafford (onboard): 15 gone. 20 gone.
125:54:45 Young (onboard): Oh, shit, I lost it...
125:54:46 Stafford (onboard): 25 gone.
125:54:47 Young (onboard): We didn't have enough roll on, Tom.
125:54:49 Stafford (onboard): You want me to roll for you?
125:54:50 Young (onboard): I'm getting it, I'm getting it [garble] I got it, I
got it, I got it.
125:54:52 Stafford (onboard): OK. 30, 35.
125:55:04 Cernan (onboard): Would you believe this thing is rolling? It's got a...
125:55:06 Stafford (onboard): OK.
125:55:07 Cernan (onboard): ...it's got a red...
125:55:08 Stafford (onboard): Hold it.
125:55:10 Cernan (onboard): ...red reflected light on it right next to the gold one. Big red reflected something...
125:55:14 Stafford (onboard): Alright. You have three?
125:55:24 Cernan (onboard): That weird.
125:55:29 Young (onboard): Say when.
125:55:30 Stafford (onboard): OK, 15 gone.
125:55:33 Young (onboard): OK, I got to get it.
125:55:34 Stafford (onboard): 20 gone. OK.
125:55:37 Young (onboard): That was terrible, wasn't it?
125:55:38 Stafford (onboard): OK. Ready to go again for the last one?
125:55:40 Young (onboard): Yes,
125:55:44 Stafford (onboard): 5 gone.
125:55:45 Young (onboard): No, no - I didn't get but four [garble].
125:55:49 Stafford (onboard): Let me take a look over here with Gene-o. He's right in my window.
125:55:52 Cernan (onboard): Tom, there's a - there was - it's almost gone - a red reflected glow along with the white.
125:56:10 Stafford (onboard): That's him alright.
125:56:11 Cernan (onboard): Bet your ass, that's him. If you watch him long enough you can see him [garble] very, very slow - tumble. You see the red [garble] gold reflection?
125:56:59 Stafford (onboard): Oh, shit, you're getting close, babe.
125:57:02 Young (onboard): Oh, not that close. How many minutes we got to go to F-1?
125:57:09 Stafford (onboard): F-1 is 26:04. To acquire, you've got 7 minutes. OK, pardon me.
125:57:15 Young (onboard): OK.
125:57:17 Stafford (onboard): And F-1 is 10 North. There he is right out there.
125:57:20 Young (onboard): 10 North?
125:57:21 Stafford (onboard): 10 miles North. Yes.
125:57:23 Young (onboard): See what we need to roll.
125:58:07 Cernan (onboard): You bet your ass. I wonder when he starts coming down, because he's always in front of us when it comes over the hill. Where is he? I guess he's gone behind us.
125:58:15 Stafford (onboard): We're supposed to be catching up with him.
125:58:18 Cernan (onboard): I haven't been watching until this time.
125:58:21 Stafford (onboard): I saw him coming up back there.
125:58:22 Cernan (onboard): We've see him.
125:58:41 Stafford (onboard): He looks a little out of plane.
125:58:43 Cernan (onboard): Yes, he is a little out of plane.
125:58:44 Stafford (onboard): He's a little out of plane. He's been torqued out of plane. He's torqued to my left, and left is what - North?
125:58:51 Cernan (onboard): Right is North. Going right is North.
125:59:10 Stafford (onboard): OK, let me look over here. F-1 is 126:01. And 126:02, Gene-o, in 3 minutes...
125:59:20 Cernan (onboard): OK.
125:59:21 Stafford (onboard): ...the Earth comes up. Why don't you stand by and get a sequence camera and also [garble]?
125:59:33 Stafford (onboard): And, John, F-1 is 04:06. You got to wait. We'll have contact with the Earth before you get there.
125:59:40 Young (onboard): Oh.
125:59:52 Cernan (onboard): OK. 1600.
125:59:55 Stafford (onboard): That looks good. Zip.
Flight Plan page 3-80.
126:00:12 Cernan (onboard): Tom, you won't have time to take yours with this, will you, while I keep the...
126:00:15 Stafford (onboard): No, no. I don't. I'll be tracking, John. Let's see - 26 - maybe I will.
126:00:21 Cernan (onboard): Well...
126:00:22 Stafford (onboard): It's 26:04:46 - I can - I can hack it real easy.
126:00:30 Cernan (onboard): OK. I can...
126:00:31 Stafford (onboard): The...
126:00:32 Cernan (onboard): ...run them both...
126:00:33 Stafford (onboard): ...the mark is 26:07 - that'll give them 20 seconds. I can take it.
126:00:35 Cernan (onboard): You want to do it?
126:00:39 Stafford (onboard): That's 26:07. OK.
126:00:47 Cernan (onboard): What time is he coming over?
126:00:49 Stafford (onboard): 51.

126:00:54 Cernan (onboard): In the meantime, [garble].
126:00:57 Stafford (onboard): He's out of plane, too.
126:00:57 PAO: This is Apollo Control at 126 hours, 1 minute and we are 50 seconds away from acquisition of Apollo 10 on the 26th lunar revolution. We will stand by live during this acquisition time.
126:01:10 Cernan (onboard): [Garble].
126:01:40 Stafford (onboard): You got a sequence of him with the 250[mm]?
126:01:43 Cernan (onboard): I got him but not with the 250. I got it with the other - with the 18. I want to get this with the 250.
126:01:55 Stafford (onboard): OK, another minute. John, you've got a ways to go. No problem.
126:01:59 Cernan (onboard): When he starts coming [garble], he comes up so fast.
126:02:03 Stafford (onboard): Don't want to use all this color film though. We still have some left on our other one, don't we?
126:02:09 Cernan (onboard): Yes. Not a lot, but there's about 30 on each one. Snoopy is still up there.
126:02:20 Stafford (onboard): 02:30. Should be coming up in 30 seconds.
126:02:24 Cernan (onboard): 02:30; it's 02:25 right now.
126:02:43 Young (onboard): 39. Did you hear the S-band?
126:02:44 Cernan (onboard): Sure did. Here it is.
126:02:58 Young (onboard): Shooting at real time there, Gene-o?
126:02:59 Cernan (onboard): Yes.
126:03:37 Duke: Hello, Apollo 10. Houston. We're standing by. Out.
126:03:42 Stafford: Roger. We're coming up to 130. [Onboard] Gene-o, start saving up each - make each one count here. OK, John. At - shoot, I said 130 - at 126:06. and you've got 290 [garble] 04:46. OK, we're coming up on the...
Stafford is concerned that they are starting to get low on the reserves on film.
Comm break.
126:04:09 Young (onboard): OK. You've got enough roll already. I can tell that.
126:04:25 Cernan (onboard): He's still back there.
126:04:34 Stafford (onboard): Got about 2.5 minutes. John.
126:04:49 Cernan (onboard): Tom. I'm going to let this one stand right out in the center. So, what I'm going to do - I'm going to go right into the landing site and get a series or them all the way up.
126:05:12 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] doggone it.
126:05:19 Stafford (onboard): OK. I can hardly see that clock.
126:05:33 Stafford (onboard): We've got about 2.5 minutes, John.
126:05:36 Young (onboard): Yes.
126:05:37 Stafford (onboard): Looks like we're lining up real good for them, babe.
126:05:39 Young (onboard): Yes. We've got plenty of roll.
126:05:42 Stafford (onboard): Orb Rate is looking good.
126:06:00 Stafford (onboard): 1 minute to go to start marking it John.
126:06:03 Young (onboard): OK.
126:06:25 Stafford (onboard): OK. If you want to wait just a little bit after 7 minutes, it would be good.
126:06:29 Young (onboard): OK. OK, now, this one here is low. Tom. I'll just start now. OK?
126:06:37 Stafford (onboard): OK, Go ahead.
126:06:40 Young (onboard): It's going to be in good shape.
126:06:42 Stafford (onboard): OK, babe. You've got 5 seconds gone.
Now marking on landmark F-1.
126:06:55 Stafford (onboard): 15, 20, 25. That's two of them. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. That's three, right?
126:07:34 Young (onboard): Yes.
126:07:37 Stafford (onboard): 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. Four. 5, 10, 15...
126:08:17 Young (onboard): That's good, Tom. Keep going.
126:08:18 Stafford (onboard): OK.
126:08:20 Young (onboard): Can't wait too late.
126:08:22 Stafford (onboard): Yes. Now we [garble] them.
126:08:27 Stafford: Hello, Houston. Apollo 10.
126:08:29 Duke: Go ahead, 10.
126:08:32 Stafford: OK. We've been delaying a little bit like you suggested about that T2 time, but the thing gets just about out of sight here and John had to hurry up on the last one, so we've been waiting about 20 seconds, and that's about it, after the T2 time.
126:08:47 Duke: Roger, 10. We copy. Sure that's OK. That sounds good. And little run down on your CP-1 and CP-2 marks on Rev-25. They looked real good to us. The marks were good and the spacing was good. We are real happy with that. Over.
126:09:08 Stafford: OK. Real fine and just might pass along to the FIDO troops down there that we noticed a star we could not identify coming up and we said well, there must be something else in orbit with us and sure enough this last pass it got close enough. It's the bottom part of Snoopy and Gene-o with his monocular can see his legs - the reflection off his legs. So as he went out in behind us, like, I guess I read that one state [garble], but we're going to slowly catch up with him. We're starting to catch up with the bottom part of Snoop, but something has torqued him out of plane a little bit, and he's going out of plane into the south of us. Maybe a mascon grabbed a hold of him, or something, but we're catching up with him. There's no doubt about it. And we can actually see the different colors of reflected light off the black in the silver panels. Over.
126:09:58 Duke: Roger. Good show. We'll pass that on to the FIDO.
126:10:07 Young: Got the data there, Houston?
126:10:09 Duke: Stand by. We got it all. You can proceed.
126:10:16 Stafford (onboard): Copy, babe.
126:10:33 Duke: 10, Houston. We can - you can increase your marking time slightly if you'll push your pitch rate up a little bit, as you go through the marking cycle. Over.
126:10:45 Stafford: OK.
126:10:46 Young (onboard): Shoot, we know that.
126:10:47 Stafford: Yes, we thought about that.
126:10:59 Stafford (onboard): OK, [garble].
126:11:18 Young (onboard): OK. Telescope, range one.
126:11:29 Stafford (onboard): Man, your downrange is right on the longitude over 2. Shit, you're right there pretty close, John, on your latitude. That shows us down in a depression, you know it?
126:11:31 Unidentified MCC-H: OK, Flight. Let's pay attention, to business now.
Comm break.
126:11:41 Young (onboard): Well, I don't know what it shows, Tom. I...
126:11:51 Stafford (onboard): OK. The next one?
126:11:55 Young (onboard): 130.
126:11:51 Stafford (onboard): We've got a ways to go.
126:11:58 Young (onboard): Yes.
126:12:00 Stafford (onboard): We've got about a - You can start marking in about 16 minutes.
126:12:15 Stafford (onboard): You want 130.
126:12:19 Young (onboard): [Garble] we'll get them early and take them late.
126:12:24 Stafford (onboard): OK.
126:12:41 Young (onboard): I can't really tell, trying it through the telescope. Maybe you need to decrease your pitch rate. I can get a feel for it [garble]. Tell you what I can do. I could show you - I could show you 1692 on there, which is shaft and trunnion, and anytime the trunnion gets more than about 25 degrees after it's come down the first time, it starts getting bigger than that, and then you got to start pitching.
126:13:13 Stafford (onboard): Yes.
126:13:15 Young (onboard): That would be 25 degrees going back that way.
126:13:47 Cernan (onboard): I thought there was a landing site right down there.
126:13:49 Stafford (onboard): Huh?
126:13:50 Cernan (onboard): [Garble].
126:13:51 Young (onboard): What?
126:13:54 Stafford (onboard): Yes.
126:13:56 Cernan (onboard): Do you have any black and white film?
126:13:58 Stafford (onboard): No.
126:13:59 Cernan (onboard): The last black and white [garble].
126:14:02 Stafford (onboard): We should have plenty of black and white. I don't...
126:14:06 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] close to the landing site, because I don't [garble].
126:14:20 Stafford (onboard): No, I don't have it over here, Gene-o.
126:14:22 Cernan (onboard): OK, [garble].
126:14:25 Young (onboard): OK. How much time now?
126:14:28 Stafford (onboard): Got lots, babe. About 12 minutes
126:14:32 Young (onboard): Why?
126:14:35 Cernan (onboard): John, [garble].
126:14:56 Stafford (onboard): You want a Pentel?
126:15:12 Cernan (onboard): John, there isn't another
126:15:16 Young (onboard): Another what?
126:15:17 Cernan (onboard): I want to get that landing site. Is there another 16 - 70-millimeter film can down in there?
126:15:22 Young (onboard): You just give me one. There is none down in there that I know of.
126:15:25 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] down in there, right? We don't have any stowed anywhere else [garble]?
126:15:29 Stafford (onboard): We're supposed to get a Landing Site 3, too. Save a little bit for that.
A mission objective is to get photography of landing site 3 in Sinus Medii.
126:15:32 Cernan (onboard): Babe, there's only 10 pictures left in here.
126:15:35 Stafford (onboard): Well, save them for landing site. That's what we're supposed to get.
126:15:40 Young (onboard): Only 10?
126:15:41 Stafford (onboard): Did you get all the black and white can out of my purse I brought?
126:16:05 Young (onboard): [Garble] some of them under the seat.
126:16:12 Stafford (onboard): Hey, there's - there's some - Oh, no, this is [garble].
126:16:15 SC (onboard): You know, [garble].
126:16:27 Cernan (onboard): I need that, though; [garble].
126:16:28 Stafford (onboard): Yes. OK, on 130, John. You want - you want that 10 degrees roll?
126:16:37 Young (onboard): Where is it? Where is it? Which [garble] of the ground track?
126:16:42 Stafford (onboard): 130 is 12 miles [22 km] North.
126:16:44 Young (onboard): No. We don't need 12 degrees in there.
126:16:47 Stafford (onboard): Do we need 5 degrees? Huh?
126:16:50 Young (onboard): 4 - 3 - something like that.
126:17:09 Young (onboard): 11266, 17839.
126:17:14 Stafford (onboard): Here's a film pack here, Gene-o.
126:17:15 Cernan (onboard): Right.
126:17:16 Stafford (onboard): It's full.
126:17:18 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] what kind it is?
126:17:20 Stafford (onboard): It's color exterior.
126:17:22 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] 70 millimeter?
126:17:25 Stafford (onboard): No, 16.
126:17:26 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] that way. How [garble] we got left, I need some [garble] the LM?
126:17:39 Stafford (onboard): OK.
126:17:43 Young (onboard): Here's one with lots of [garble].
126:17:45 Stafford (onboard): OK.
126:17:52 SC (onboard): (coughing).
126:18:10 Stafford (onboard): Beautiful.
126:18:12 Young (onboard): You got one with a lot? Maybe there's some stored where we don't never think of to look.
126:18:22 Cernan (onboard): Well, I guess - Oh, shit, do you realize - God dang.
126:18:34 Young (onboard): Do you realize that we almost don't get any [garble]?
126:18:40 Stafford (onboard): You what?
126:18:41 Young (onboard): Do you realize that all [garble]? OK, I'll put this camera mount on.
126:18:55 Stafford (onboard): Got it.
126:18:58 Cernan (onboard): [Garble] floating around with a monocular.
126:19:07 Young (onboard): How much time we got in here. Tom?
126:19:09 Stafford (onboard): OK. I can see it coming way up ahead here. We're just over Messier.
126:19:16 Young (onboard): And there's Taruntius [garble] some kind of goddam fool.
126:19:21 Stafford (onboard): I'm getting another [garble].
126:19:26 SC (onboard): Whew!
126:19:33 Stafford (onboard): We [garble] no big (yawn) [garble] Moon.
126:19:42 Young (onboard): God. That one down there looks just like somebody...
126:19:45 Stafford (onboard): That one on the left?
126:19:48 Young (onboard): Yes.
126:19:57 Stafford (onboard): OK. 126:25:53. You got him - you'll acquire and at 27:30, he's there, so at about 28 - 27:30 to 27:50.

This is Apollo Control at 126 hours, 20 minutes. To repeat an earlier announcement, the TV transmission scheduled for this time has been postponed. The crew is busy with landmark tracking. This TV transmission has been rescheduled to 132 hours Elapsed Time on revolution number 29. We'll continue to stand by live.
126:20:11 Young (onboard): OK, I may have you pitch on that [garble].
126:26:20 Young (onboard): Are you Orb Rate, Tom?
126:26:21 Stafford (onboard): Yes. Sure am. Holding right there.
126:26:30 Stafford (onboard): 27:25 about another minute and 30 seconds, babe.
126:26:43 Young (onboard): It's A, B. and E - A. B. and D. I mean - leading into E.
126:27:09 Young (onboard): Alright. We're there.
126:27:11 Stafford (onboard): OK. We'll - to get the mark in � [cough] - you said 27:25.
126:27:17 Young (onboard): OK babe. Say when.
126:27:19 Stafford (onboard): OK. Just keep tracking it, babe. You can tell me when you want me to pitch. OK. There's your 27:25 and now just hold off for a little bit while I come up in pitch.
126:27:30 Young (onboard): Can I take the marks?
126:27:32 Stafford (onboard): OK. Go ahead.
127:27:34 Stafford (onboard): Mark.
127:27:37 Stafford (onboard): Do you put 30 seconds between each one?
127:27:39 Young (onboard): No.
127:27:40 Stafford (onboard): OK. You want me to pitch. down for you?
127:27:43 Young (onboard): Not yet. How much is that?
127:27:47 Stafford (onboard): 15 seconds gone. 20, 25, 30. That's two. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.
Marking on landmark 130.
127:28:37 Young (onboard): OK, pitch a little, Tom.
127:28:41 Stafford (onboard): You got one more?
127:28:44 Young (onboard): Got two more to go.
127:28:47 Stafford (onboard): OK, since you made that mark, there's 15, 20, 25, 30. One more to go.
127:29:09 Stafford (onboard): 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.
126:29:36 Young (onboard): OK.
126:29:40 Stafford: Houston, that completes five Marks. We had exactly 30 seconds between the marks. Over.
126:29:47 Duke: Roger, 10. We copy.
126:29:49 SC (onboard): Whew!
126:30:06 Stafford (onboard): OK. We've got one more rev this routine.
126:30:10 Young (onboard): One more REV of this and we're [garble].
126:30:12 Stafford (onboard): How's our fuel doing? Oh, we haven't used much fuel.
126:30:46 Young: Houston, this is 10. Do you want me to go ahead and pitch over before you give us the update and [garble] go ahead and talk a little bit.
126:30:55 Duke: Stand by.
126:31:01 Young (onboard): They'll want the data.
126:31:09 Duke: Hello, 10. Houston. You can go ahead and maneuver and give us the High Gain. Then we'll give you the update after that. Over.
126:31:18 Stafford: Alrighty.
126:31:19 Young: You got the data, Charlie?
126:31:21 Duke: Stand by. We got it, 10. You can proceed.
126:31:26 Young: OK. Pitching over.
126:31:41 Cernan (onboard): We're getting something out of [garble] I don't know what the hell else. Let me know when you get about halfway there, Tom; I'll get them on High Gain [garble].
126:32:04 Stafford (onboard): Yes. Same attitude as before. That looks pretty good what they worked out for these flight [garble].
126:32:22 Stafford (onboard): There's an interesting one - that sunset out there.
126:32:27 Young (onboard): Look at that altitude.
126:32:31 Stafford (onboard): Yes. Let me - copy it down there, John. Plus 01401, plus 11...
126:32:38 Young: Houston, Apollo 10. Over.
126:32:42 Duke: Go ahead, 10. Houston.
126:32:45 Young: Roger. On that last pass, I'm sure the same CP-1 I marked on with the sextant on rev on the first - on the second track rev, I marked on with the third one. Acquire at CP-2 is the same in all three cases and F-1 is the same in all three cases and that 130 is the same in all three cases.
126:34:19 Duke: Roger, John. We copy all that. John, we copy all that.
126:34:26 Young: The last pass I only got four marks on [garble] because the sextant wasn't [garble].
126:34:43 Duke: 10, Houston. You're breaking up. We'll talk to you when you get on the High Gain. We've lost you. Over.

126:37:31 Young: Houston, how are you reading us on High Gain?
126:37:40 Duke: Hello, Apollo 10. Houston. We have a TEI PAD for you and rev updates and landmark tracking updates. Over.
126:37:55 Stafford: Go ahead. You want to start on the map update?
126:37:58 Duke: Your choice, 10. Over.
126:38:04 Stafford: Go ahead.
126:38:06 Duke: Roger, Tom. First we'd like we got a state vector for you if you'd give us P00 and Accept, and I'll start out with the map update for Rev-27.
126:38:19 Stafford: OK. We're in P00 and Accept.
126:38:27 Duke: OK, 10. Coming at you with Rev-27 map update; 127:15:15, 127:26:26, 128:01:26. OK, a landmark tracking update coming at you for CP-1; 127:35:02, 127:38:03, 000, 053, 000; north 14, 12, 41. Are you with me? Over.

126:44:02 Duke: Roger. All a good readback. Standing by for the TEI PAD.
126:44:08 Stafford: Roger.
126:44:16 Cernan: TEI-27, SPS G&N; Noun 33 is 129:39:18.71; plus 32367, plus 00410, plus 00075; and pitch is 061, and two jets 14 seconds.
The TEI-27 PAD is interpreted as follows:
Purpose: The PAD is a revised version for an emergency burn to return to Earth at the end of Rev-27.
Systems: The burn would be made using the SPS engine, under the control of the Guidance and Navigation system.
Vehicle weight (Noun 47): N/A
Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48):N/A
Time of ignition (Noun 33): 129 hours, 39 minutes, 18.71 seconds.
Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s): x, +3,236.7 (986.5); y, +0041.0 (12.5); z, +0007.5 (2.3). The large positive number in the X direction implies a large prograde component, essentially adding to their orbital velocity, exactly what would be expected from an escape manoeuvre.
Spacecraft attitude (IMU angles): Roll, NA; Pitch, 6.1°.
An additional note instructs to burn two RCS jets for 14 seconds in an ullage burn to settle the propellants to the aft of the tanks. All the subsequent items on the form are not applicable to this manoeuvre.
126:44:33 Duke: Roger. Good readback, Gene, and the computer is yours. You can go back to Block. And Tom, we got a TV plan for you if you'd like to turn to page 3-85 of your Flight Plan, and we'll run through this and see what you think about it. When you get there, give me a call. Over.
126:44:57 Stafford: OK. I'm there, Charlie. Go.
126:45:01 Duke: OK, what we'd like to do is - we think we can on REV 29 we can get good High Gain and TV on both Revs 29 and 31 by doing the following things: on Rev-29, we'd like to get the obliques to Landing Site 3 at fly as inked into the Flight Plan; that is, roll angle 180, ORDEAL of 339 in pitch, heads down, and we'll send you the Landing Site 3 PAD as scheduled. This will give us good TV obliques for training and a High Gain acquisition, but the High Gain acquisition may be delayed just slightly, but we think we'll probably get it right away. Now on Rev-31, coming up on page 3-89, we'd like to - During the descent strip photos, we suggest that you fly them as you flew them this morning, when you were doing the vertical stereo on Rev-23: with a roll angle of 180, and ORDEAL of 282 in pitch, and our remarks are to remember to pitch as required to shade the windows near the terminator. And again we'll send you the PAD as scheduled. Now this attitude will give us good TV good High Gain for TV panoramas of what you guys are seeing flying backwards, and if you concur with that schedule, we'd like to go as is. Over.
126:46:44 Stafford: OK. That seems real good now, and we'll get an update after that on - as you were - update PAD for TEI after that, and we'll be all squared away.
126:46:58 Duke: Roger. Very good. If you feel like we're pushing you on TEI on the Rev-31, we can discontinue that TV at any time. Over.
126:47:10 Stafford: OK. We'll check and see how it goes. We want to get everything squared away before TEI, and that certainly has about last priority, but we'll see how it works out.
126:47:21 Duke: Fine, Tom.
126:47:22 Stafford: And, I guess we're all squared away to pick it up on the - Over. I guess we're all squared away to pick it up after TEI, when we come around to look back. Right? Over.
126:47:32 Duke: That's affirmative. We've got you for the ATT then. We'll be standing by. Out.
126:47:38 Stafford: Roger.
126:49:24 Duke: Apollo 10, Houston. On the Rev-26 tracking that we saw for F-1 and 130: John, you did a great job. It's looking really great. Over.
126:49:42 Young: Thank you. But it was a team effort.
126:49:47 Duke: Roger.
The crew commented on the landmark tracking exercise during the post flight debriefing.
Stafford, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "We all realized that probably one of the most important things to support the lunar landing mission was to really wire down the lunar potential with respect to the mathematical model and to make these landmark trackings as accurate as possible. For this, the CMP had spent a lot of time in the simulator. Also, between the CMP and CDR, we had worked out real close co-ordination techniques. I would visually pick up a target through the left rendezvous window and then lead in on the exact times when the CMP would pick it up. Once the first mark was made, I would time him in increments of 5 seconds, so he could evenly space his marks."
Young, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "The ground came up and told us we were marking 20, 25, and 30 seconds too soon, so we delayed our time of marking. It's my opinion that you cannot judge by looking at the geometry when you should start marking from your attitude. This is particularly true if you only have one man in there, unless you just do it on time. There's no way a guy can judge accurately when he should commence marking from the geometry of the situation. This is particularly so when he can't see the horizon before he starts, which was true in every case. If we are going to continue to do landmark tracking, the following changes are recommended. During the marking, when the flashing 51 takes marks, it is recommended that the shaft and trunnion angles be displayed in register 1 and register 2. It is also recommended that, when you are in Auto Optics and between the 90-degree and the 50-degree test, the trunnion angle be extended so that the optics move out and trunnion to the right position so it doesn't waste that time when it passes the 50-degree test of that 5 or 6 seconds that it takes to run the trunnion all the way out. Other than that, I think the landmark tracking worked adequately, but it was very frustrating. Particularly, when we were coming up late on the marks, and we missed several marks because of the delay involved in the trunnion running out to the 50-degree line when we were oriented at a somewhat different position. We just had to wait on the Auto Optics to get out to its full travel."
Stafford, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "The total effort of tracking four landmarks over four consecutive revolutions and doing the IMU realign and star check was tremendous work load on the CMP. But we got all the data, and the results appeared to be excellent."
Young, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "Let me say something about the ability to mark. Sometimes, due to the location of subsolar point, the surface was just too bright to mark on through the sextant, so we had to use a telescope. This is true of F-1 and sometimes of CP-2, when we first started. The way that those marks were made should be recorded. It is believed that the first data point on CP-1 was not the same place that was tracked on the following passes. The last 3 passes on CP-1 were all on the same landmark, and they were done with a sextant. CP-2 points were all done on the same point. The first two were done with the sextant; the third one was done with the sextant and the telescope. There were only four marks taken on the third one because we lost the target due to a sun washout. The fourth was done with the telescope, but they all are on the same mark. F-1 was probably marked on the wrong place for the first mark, but it is not known for sure. The first markings were done with the sextant. The second, third, and fourth marks were all done on the same place on F-1 and were done with a telescope. The major inaccuracies involved in AUTO optics tracking was noted on F-1 where it is estimated that Auto Optics had to slew about 5 degrees to find the actual F-1 target. In every case, the original location of the landmark was placed in the sextant. Site 130 was all done with the sextant, and I think they are all pretty evenly spaced. The bottom of 130 was not tracked. What was tracked in 130 was a small crater on the far side - inside 130 about an estimated three-quarters of the way to the bottom of 130. The location of each one of those landmarks will have to point out precisely from the photographs that we took on the sight. On CP-2, we were tracking a crater which is an estimated 130 to 140 feet across (40 x 43 meters). On 130, the sextant tracking, we kept the marks right in the middle of the crater. It was an estimated 140 feet across, assuming that 90 feet (when you are directly overhead) would fill the circle inside the optics reticle. Tracking was very easy. The real problem was tracking through the sextant near the subsolar point when the surface was just so bright that you couldn't define anything. Another problem was the times when that reddish color of the landmark line of sight interfered with the real line of sight. When that happened, it would clobber our vision."
Stafford, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "One thing that had gone into this total effort on landmark tracking was a lot of preflight planning. We would let Gene continue to photograph the Moon; and as we went to the terminator, I would pitch fix to a predetermined inertial angle so John could do the alignment and star check. Then, I would call Verb 83, enter, and match this inertial angle with the orbital rate that we needed. I'd phase right into the Orb Rate. We did a tremendous amount of maneuvering on that; but by going ahead on the planning and by being very precise with the maneuvers, we were able to do this entire tracking with very little fuel."
Young, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "I would like to emphasize that this was a team effort -- the whole day was a complete team effort. Tom was directing me and pointing out where the landmarks were. I can't overemphasize how valuable the strip maps were to lead us into these landmarks. It worked out really well, much better than we had hoped for, particularly in view of the fact that we were not watching the horizon. We were just going with the pitch angles given by the ground, and they worked out very well. It was a team effort that started way back in the Data Priority Meetings, and it certainly worked out well."

126:52:08 Duke: Hello, Apollo 10, Houston. You know, we'd like you to start charging battery B. Over.
126:52:16 Stafford: Roger. Battery B.
126:52:20 Cernan: OK, babe. If you think we can hack it. Here goes.
126:53:00 Cernan: Oh, it looks good here, Charlie.
126:53:11 Duke: Roger, Gene-o. You're really not pulling much more current at all out of this thing, and we think you're going to be in good shape. Over.
126:53:17 Cernan: Hey, you know that idea on the fans to build up the cryo pressure? Man, thats a great idea. It brings them up. It appears to bring them up faster and use less energy. Man, maybe we should be doing that all the time.

127:05:14 Duke: 10, Houston. We've got 10 minutes to LOS. See you over the hill at 128:01.
127:05:22 Stafford: OK, Charlie. Look, we've been talking this over, and what we'll do is when we shoot those obliques in the Landing Site 3, we'll give you the TV pass then. We'd like to continue on, and if this Vidicon has the strength, like to show you what Earthshine is around the Moon. It'll just continue on, it would delay P52 a little bit, and then that will be the only TV pass here. Now we think we want to get everything squared away before TEI, and then after TEI as we leave the Moon I'll turn it around: we'll turn that barrel full time for you. Over.
127:05:55 Duke: Roger, 10. That's a good plan. We concur. Over.

This is Apollo Control at 127 hours, 15 minutes; and we've had Loss Of Signal on the 26th revolution. Just prior to acquisition on this revolution, the crew saw the descent stage of Snoopy, the Lunar Module. After we acquired, Tom Stafford said, well, they had been behind the Moon and saw what looked like a star out of place, but that Gene Cernan, using the monocular could see the legs of the descent stage and was identified as part of Snoopy. Tom reported it appeared that Charlie Brown was catching up slowly to the descent stage but was in a different plane. Landmark tracking continued throughout this pass. We passed up a TV plan suggesting television transmissions on revolution No. 29 at 132 hours. This will be while the crew is taking oblique photographs of Landing Site 3 and we suggested, if possible, descent - or TV on rev 31 while the crew is taking descent strip photographs. That should be at approximately 134 hours Elapsed Time. Little bit later Tom Stafford came back and scrubbed out the revolution 31 television, pointed out that they would be busy getting ready for the Trans-Earth Injection burn. He indicated that on the revolution 29 television that in addition to providing television during the photography, he would leave it on a little bit longer and attempt to show Earth shine. He also indicated that he would turn the television camera on after the Trans-Earth Injection burn and leave it on for a while. We're presently showing at ignition time for Trans-Earth Injection of 137 hours, 36 minutes, 28 seconds. That may change a little bit prior to TEI but it should not change a great deal. As we lost signal on this revolution, Apollo 10 was in a 67.6 by 54.1 nautical miles (125.2 x 100.2 km) orbit. The orbital period; 1 hour, 58 minutes, 49 seconds; velocity, 5,312 feet per second (1,619 m/s) and spacecraft weight, 36,750 pounds (16,670 kg). We will acquire Apollo 10 on the 27th revolution at 128 hours, 1 minute. This is Mission Control, Houston.
