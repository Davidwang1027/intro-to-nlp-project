113:13:33 Mattingly: America, Houston. The LM has a Stay for T-2.
Evans: Hey, okay. Great. Stay for T-2. Beautiful.
Mattingly: Okay, and I...
Evans: Looks like they hit the right spot?
Mattingly: Yeah. They must be right in there. And I got your Pan Camera photo PAD, whenever you're ready for it on 129. That's page 129. Excuse me.
Evans: Okay. Just a second.
Evans: Okay. Ready to copy.
113:14:19 Mattingly: Okay. T-start: 114:03:11; T-stop: 114:33:18.
Evans: Okay. T-start: 114:03:11; stop: 114:33:18.
Mattingly: Okay. That's correct.
113:15:08 Mattingly: And, America, we're ready for the High Gain to Auto.
113:15:15 Evans: Okay. You have it.

113:17:05 Evans: Yeah. It's a good thing it's in the sextant because you can't see it in the telescope. Because the Earth is in the field of view.
Mattingly: Are you able to get something in the sextant, or would you like for us to look for some new stars and attitudes?
Evans: No. You can see them in the sextant real well, Ken. You just can't see them in the telescope.
Mattingly: Okay. That's a mighty pretty thing to look at in the telescope, though, isn't it?
Evans: Yeah, it sure is.
Evans: You know, I noticed there's even a lot of difference in the Earthshine and - and in the double umbra. You get in Earthshine on the thing, and it's - it's hard to see the stars even if you don't have the Earth in there.
Mattingly: Yeah. That - that makes a surprising difference.
Evans: The double umbra on the back side of the Moon - Yeah. The double umbra on the back side of the Moon is even better than the simulator [laughter].
113:19:36 Evans: Okay. If those look good to you, I'll torque at 20.
Mattingly: Okay. That looks good.
Long comm break.

113:25:18 Evans: Okay, Houston; this is America. I think I'll go ahead and use a shaft to 00.12, and a 57.470.
Mattingly: Okay. We copied that.
Evans: That's for the COAS cal.
Mattingly: All righty. That thing flies a little better than the simulator on that, doesn't it?
Evans: Yeah. It sure does. It's outstanding, as a matter of fact. You can even see the star out here.
Mattingly: Ah, it's a rather wondrous thing. When you get around to it, I've got a Hydrogen tank 1 call. I'd like to have you turn that to Off.
Evans: Okay. Let me get started here in the P20 attitude.
Mattingly: Sure thing.
113:28:01 Evans: Okay. Go on the H2 tank, thanks.
Mattingly: Okay. That's Hydrogen tank number 1 should be turned Off.
113:28:26 Evans: Okay. H2 Fans, number 1, Off.
Mattingly: Okay. And I missed seeing you set the Verb 44. Did you get that one in?
Evans: Yeah. I did it while I was doing the P52 for Procyon. I'll do it again.
113:28:56 Mattingly: Okay. It's all - it looks good, Ron.
Evans: Okay.
113:29:12 Evans: And Rendezvous Transponder is Off.
Mattingly: Okay. Thank you.
113:30:28 Evans: Okay. Pan Camera Power is coming Off.
Mattingly: All right.
113:30:51 Evans: And the VHF is Off to Receive Only - is Off.
Mattingly: Okay. And Olso's [?] standing here with baited breath.
Evans: He's ready to go to work, isn't he?
Mattingly: Yes. He's chomping at the bit.
113:31:07 Evans: Okay. We're in Deploy/Retract. Circuit breakers are In.
113:31:11 Evans: SM/AC Power's On, and those circuit breakers are In. So 181's squared away.
113:31:27 Evans: Okay. Data System is going On.
Mattingly: Okay.
113:31:33 Evans: IR is going On.
113:31:37 Evans: UV is going On. Okay. Let's open a few covers.
113:32:08 Evans: Okay. Mapping Camera. Laser Altimeter. Barber pole, and then a gray.
113:32:18 Evans: IR; barber pole, and a gray.
113:32:26 Evans: UV Cover; a barber pole, and a gray. And we'll try timing the old Mapping Camera. See how she does this time.
Mattingly: Okay.
Evans: I'll watch it. Okay. 3, 2, 1...
113:32:50 Evans: Mark it.
113:32:52 Mattingly: Okay. Got my clock running.
Evans: Okay.

113:35:01 Evans: Still barber pole.
Mattingly: Yeah. We're commenting on the same thing. We don't have any data yet, but [garble]...
Evans: [Laughter.]
Evans: Hey, it went gray.
113:36:10 Evans: Mark it.
Mattingly: Okay. Thank you.
Evans: About 3 minutes and 20 seconds, wasn't it?
Mattingly: Yes, sir. 03:21. Okay, Ron. And before we get started this morning, we skipped the lithium canister change, and that was back at 108 hours and 10 minutes on page 3-109. So, at your convenience, you might want to catch up on that one.
Evans: [Laughter.] Okay. Do you have it handy there? What it is? Which one?
Mattingly: Yeah. Just a second. I'll read it to you.
Evans: Can you just tell me?
113:37:00 Mattingly: Okay. We wanted to take 11 into A, and stow number 9, which you're going to take out, into A-9.
Evans: Into A-9. Okay. That must be where 11 is then.
Mattingly: Eleven should be in - Yeah, okay. It ought to be in A-9 there, hopefully.
Evans: [Whistling.]

113:41:01 Evans: Okay. The old lithium hydroxide canister's changed.
Mattingly: Okay. Thank you.
Evans: And, Ken, can you give me a hack on Houston time there? Or Greenwich Mean Time or something so I can set my watch?
113:42:16 Mattingly: Okay. I'll give you Houston time. It's 14:35:21 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5.
Evans: Okay. Mighty fine. Thank you.
113:43:25 Mattingly: Okay, America. We're about 3 minutes from LOS. All systems look good. And GNC has noticed that you've got the Optics not in Zero, and next time you're down that way, it would make everybody feel better if you'd put it there. It's not - not something that you have to do right away.
Evans: [Laughter.] Okay. Will do. Good way to keep me honest.
113:43:58 Mattingly: And a [garble] to that.
Very long comm break.
The CapCom role shifts from Ken Mattingly to Robert Overmyer.

113:44:26 - This is Apollo Control at 113 hours, 44 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17. Some refined numbers on the landing site for Challenger: In degrees, minutes and seconds, the latitude has been pinned down to 20 degrees, 9 minutes, 50.5 seconds north; longitude 30 degrees, 46 minutes, 19.3 minutes - or seconds east, which is about 639 meters east of the designated landing point - the premission landing point. For those newsmen who have the landing site with the grid coordinates on it, that corresponds to DN.0 by 84.2. At 113:45 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.

113:48:59 - This is Apollo Control at 113 hours, 48 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We're estimating a change of shift, if you will Press Conference, with the landing team flight director, Gerry Griffin, in the small briefing room at 3:00 pm. To repeat, estimated Press Conference in about 20 minutes, approximately, 18 minutes to be exact, in the small Briefing Room in Building 1. Some 42 minutes away from acquisition as the Command Module, America, comes around on revolution 14. Meanwhile on the surface, to repeat the estimated landing site. It is right down the line on the Ground Track. However some 369 meters east or short of the predesignated, premission landing point.

114:11:10 - This is Apollo control at 114 hours, 11 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 17. Commander Gene Cernan's heart rate during the descent and landing ranged from 102 average during the descent portion of the landing to 128 at actual touchdown. There's a change of shift briefing that will start momentarily in the small briefing room in building 1. We'll take down the broadcast line at this time, tape any conversation during that period and play it back at the conclusion of the briefing which starts now. This is Apollo Control out.
The audio recordings of the CSM solo mission that are currently available to the Journal cease at this point. They resume at 119:19:29.
114:32:15 Overmyer: America, Houston.
Evans: Do-de-do-do. Looks like we're about to acquire.
Overmyer: America, Houston.
Evans: 33:18 is stop time. No, no. That's better than having a trail. Let's try it. Cantaro [?]. Whoops. Good work. There it goes.
114:33:03 Evans: Just about to make it.
114:33:22 Evans: Map Camera is Standby.
114:33:37 Overmyer: America, Houston. We're reading you. How us?
114:33:44 Evans: Okay; just about have you, Houston. But not quite.
Evans: Not quite.
Comm break.
114:36:01 Evans: [Garble] vent's closed. Okay, Houston. This is America. Looks like we have you for good now.
Overmyer: Roger. Ron, you're looking great. We need a - words on the spacecraft condition. We got a couple of rockets out at White Sands ready to launch for a UV calibration, and we need the Go from you on that.
Evans: [Laughter.] Yes, I'm great up here. They're not going to try to hit me, are they?
Overmyer: No, babe. We wouldn't do that. These are a couple of calibration rockets on Aerobee.
Evans: [Laughter.] Okay. Sounds great. Tape motion has stopped, by the way. And I'm ready to charge battery B.
Overmyer: Roger. That's a Go on that.
Evans: By the way, battery - Okay - the battery compartment pressure went up to 0.8 after 3 or 4 days here.
Overmyer: Roger, Ron. We copy that.
114:37:18 Evans: Okay. Bus Ties are Off; Pyro Bus Ties are Open. Let's see about Bus A and B. I think those are Open. Yes, they're Open.
114:37:40 Evans: Okay; Relay Bus Bat B is Open - coming Open. Getting around to battery charger. Bat Charge to Alpha and then to Bravo. Both about 30.
Overmyer: Ron, we're ready for bat - Pan Camera Power, Off.
114:38:24 Evans: Okay. Pan Camera Power is Off. And - let's see. Is the time for the Lunar Sounder stuff?
Overmyer: Got about 3 minutes on that, Ron.
Evans: Okay.
Evans: You know, all I did was eat for 3 days. And now I don't even get a chance to eat.
Overmyer: Roger. You getting hungry?
Evans: I've had two gingerbread bars and a brownie, so far.
Overmyer: Yes. We're going to keep you busy.
Evans: [Laughter.] Okay. That's good.
Overmyer: I understand they left you some scissors so you can eat. Huh?
Evans: Yes, fortunately. I still got them. I even got them tied down this time.
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: Did Challenger figure out where they are? Are they pretty close to - the center of the ellipse?
Overmyer: They look like they're a couple of hundred meters short, Ron. No problem. They landed in a smooth area. And that's what counted.
Evans: Oh, that's great.
114:42:11 Evans: Okay. Lunar Sounder Operate is in Standby. Recorder is going On. Radar is going On. Recorder is gone Off. Off to center; not to Heaters. And the Mode is going to VHF.
Overmyer: Thank you, Ron. I've got that Pan Camera photo PAD any time you want it.
Evans: Okay. Let's see, 116:30. Huh?
Evans: [Humming] Okay; ready to copy.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron. T-start time: 116:31:10. T-stop time: 116:59:46.
Evans: Start: 116:31:10. T-stop: 116:59:46.
Overmyer: Good readback, Ron.
Overmyer: Ron, we'd like the High Gain to Auto.
114:44:09 Evans: High Gain to Auto.
Evans: And, Houston; America here. I'm ready to do the Lunar Sounder Extend test here for a while, if you want. Whenever you're ready.
Overmyer: Roger. Stand by, Ron.
114:45:40 Overmyer: Okay, America. We're ready for the HF Antenna Extend test, and, just for your information, White Sands got one of the rockets off. The other one was a No Go.
Evans: Oh, okay. Good.
Evans:114:46:02 Okay. HF Antenna 1. Barber pole. 1001, 1002. It's Off. Gray. Okay; number 1, Retract, barber pole. Barber pole? No barber pole. Very interesting.
Evans: Would you believe number 1 stuck out there?
Overmyer: Roger, Ron. We're seeing stall current right now.
Overmyer: Ron, we'd like to go Off on HF Antenna 1. And standby on number 2.
Evans: Okay; it's Off, and, of course, it went gray again.
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: You say standby for number 2?
Overmyer: Stand by on that, Ron. Don't do number 2 yet.
Evans: Okay. I won't do it yet.
114:49:51 Overmyer: America, Houston. We'd like to try Antenna 1 again. We'd like you to go Extend for barber pole plus 3 seconds, then Off, then Retract.
Evans: Okay. We'll try that. HF number 1, Extend. 1001, 1002, 1003. It's Off. And, of course, I got a barber pole as it was going up. Okay; you want to try Retract again?
Overmyer: That's affirmative.
114:50:32 Evans: Okay. HF for number 1 to Retract, now. And a barber pole.
Overmyer: Ron, we'd like you to turn it Off now.
114:51:14 Evans: Okay; it's Off, and the talkback is gray.
Comm break.
114:53:56 Overmyer: Ron, Houston here. On that one, we followed your Retract current in for 7 seconds, and then it went into stall; so it apparently is the track - it's retracting normally up to a point, and then goes into stall. We'd like you to press on and do Extend on HF Antenna 2. And we're going to press on here, probably thinking like maybe we won't get the antennas in. And on Antenna 2...
Evans: Okay.
Overmyer: ...it's - it's according to the Flight Plan, barber pole plus 2 seconds.
Evans: Okay; we'll go barber pole plus 2.
114:54:31 Evans: Okay. Number 2, Extend. Barber pole 1001, 1002. Off. Okay; number 2 going to Retract, now. Barber pole 1001, 1002. Hey! Okay; it went gray - and back to Off.
Overmyer: Roger. We copy that.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron. You're Go for the extending, and just a reminder on the Flight Plan, there's a Recorder, On, prior to the Extend there.
Evans: Oh, okay; that's good.
114:55:28 Evans: Okay. Recorder's going On. And we'll extend number 1. Let me get the clock going here. Okay; 3, 2, 1...
114:55:44 Evans: Mark it.
Overmyer: Currents are looking good. The extension is looking normal, so far. And the Aerobee rocket had some problem...
Evans: Okay; great.
Overmyer: ...and didn't get a chance to look at the Sun.
Evans: Uh-oh.
Overmyer: And they're going to try and launch a couple more the day after tomorrow.
Evans: Very good.
114:56:45 Evans: Hey, I think I can see a light spot down there on the landing site where they might have blown off some of that halo stuff.
Overmyer: Roger. Interesting, interesting comment.
Evans: It's between Sherlock and Camelot - between...
The Apollo 17 landing site between craters Camelot and Sherlock, as photographed by Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Note the lightening of the surface around the Lunar Module -
114:57:00 Evans: Hey, it's gray now on the number 1 Extend.
Overmyer: Roger. We got it. And we got - we copy it's all the way out down here. You can to go Off on that one.
114:57:08 Evans: Okay; number 2 is going to - it's Off. And number 2 is going to Extend.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron. The currents look normal on number 2 while it extends.
Evans: Okay.
114:58:17 Evans: Hey, I can see number 2.
Overmyer: Roger. That's good show. It's going to be moving, Ron.
Evans: All the way out there. It is?
Evans: My window's all fogged up here, and can't see a thing.
Overmyer: Roger.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron. We show it all the way out...
Evans: Fogged up on the [garble] side [garble].
Overmyer: ...so you can go ahead and turn it off.
114:59:09 Evans: Okay; we'll turn it off.
Evans: Houston, this is America.
Overmyer: Go ahead, Ron.
Evans: I didn't have my map there, but I was looking at the landing site, and as close as I can remember, it had to be somewhere around about DN 83.3 on the 200-meter scale, the TL25-8.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron. I'm coming up on some Flight Plan operations on the Mapping Camera that you might want to check.
Evans: Thank you.
Evans: Okay.
115:03:58 Evans: Probably dark down there. Mapping Camera to Off.
115:04:49 Evans: Okay; Mapping Camera to Standby. Laser Altimeter, Off. Image Motion, Off. Barber pole; gray.
115:05:08 Evans: Mapping Camera to Off.
115:06:09 Evans: Let's see. Pan Camera Self Test, Off. And it's after sunset. UV, Off. IR is Off. Data System is Off. SM/AC Power, we're going to get that Off. SM/AC Power is Off. Okay; it looks like 12. Lunar Sounder to Operate.
115:09:01 Overmyer: America, while we're waiting for this Lunar Sounder to operate for 2 minutes, could you - could you say again those coordinates you gave us. I dug out the map TL 25-8, and I got the 83.3, but what was the azimuth coordinate on that, Ron?
Evans: It was Dog November, and maybe just a little bit to the right of Dog November.
Overmyer: Okay; Dog November. Thank you. And you think that's where they are, huh?
Evans: Yes.
Overmyer: Okay.
Evans: Well, there's the - there's a real white spot down there, you know. And I didn't have - I only got a short - I only got a look at that thing for about 30 seconds before I had to so something else. But I'm just re - re - recalling in my mind where the - where the white spot is with respect to those - there's Camelot and there's Sherlock, and then from Camelot to Sherlock, there were two other craters, and they were just a little bit closer to Camelot, but between those two other craters there.
Overmyer: Good show. Roger.
Evans: There's a white spot - yes, there's a white spot on the - like it might have been dust blowing or something, you know.
Overmyer: Roger. That may be the - the rocket exhaust. It might be just a little off that light spot.
Evans: Yes.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron. We're ready for Lunar Sounder, Operate to Operate. And if you'll give me a mark, I'll time it out for you.
Evans: Okay. Stand by. 3, 2, 1...
115:11:13 Evans: Mark it. Barber pole; gray.
Comm break.
115:13:15 Evans: Okay; she's Standby. Mode has gone to HF. I'll select, I'm going to need Bravo. Too bad. Do old High Gain, Manual and Wide. That's 12 and 211.
115:14:23 Evans: Okay; minus 12, 211. High Gain Antenna Power is Off. Bit Rate is Low. Okay; ready for the HF part of it?
Overmyer: Stand by, Ron.
Evans: Okay; standing by.
115:16:18 - This is Apollo Control at 115 hours, 16 minutes. Mission Control at presently is using these coordinates as the landing point. We will continue to try to refine that landing point further. But, as of now, we're saying the landing point is 20 degrees, 9 minutes, 50 seconds north; 30 degrees, 46 minutes, 19 seconds east. This would correspond to - on the map, for those of you who have grid maps, DM 8 and 82.7. This...
115:17:25 - It's estimated that the Lunar Module Challenger is on the planned north south line and approximately 1 to 200 meters east of the planned landing point.
115:18:35 - This is Apollo Control at 115 hours, 18 minutes. We want to distinguish between the targeted landing point and the planned landing point. It had been the crew's intention all along to land approximately 200 meters east or short of the targeted landing point, the point at which the computer was targeting the Challenger. So, we believe that Challenger is approximately 300 meters east of the targeted landing point, which would put it about 100 to 200 meters east of the planned landing point.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron. You can go Lunar Sounder Operate to Operate.
115:15:03 Evans: Okay. Operate at 15. Barber pole and then a gray.
Comm break.
115:17:03 Evans: Sounder to Standby at 17.
Overmyer: Roger.
115:17:09 Evans: Okay; Bit Rate - Bit Rate to High.
Overmyer: Stand by, Ron.
Evans: May as well pull some film for - Okay; we'll stand by.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron. Lunar Sounder Operate to Operate. We're all set.
Evans: Okay. We'll make it at 17:40.
Overmyer: Roger.
115:17:43 Evans: 17:40, went to Operate.
115:18:44 Evans: 18:40. Lunar Sounder, Standby.
Overmyer: Roger, Ron. Just for your information, whatever we could read down here was looking great.
Evans: Hey, great!
Overmyer: Both HF and VHF look good, and we saw no visible interference on the CSM telemetry.
Evans: Hey, outstanding! That's great.
Evans: Now, if the old antenna would come back in, we'd be in good shape, huh?
Overmyer: Yes, sir.
115:19:56 Evans: Okay; we're maneuvering to VHF test attitude.
Long comm break.
115:26:26 Evans: Okay, Houston. I'm about ready to press ahead, if you all are?
Overmyer: Stand by on that, Ron. Okay, Ron. We are all ready to press on.
115:26:53 Evans: Okay. High Gain Antenna Power is On. We go to Manual and Wide. Minus about 12, and Yaw about 21 or something, 211. [Garble] on the High Gain. Ah-ha, Auto. Looks like it worked pretty good. Okay. Mode to VHF. Find it - there it is. Mode to VHF.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron. We're ready for Lunar Sounder Operate to Operate.
Evans: Okay. Operate at 28.
115:28:04 Evans: Operate.
Evans: Boy, you talk about night flying, this is the kind of night flying you want to do, by the full Earth.
Overmyer: Is that right?
Evans: Beautiful out there.
115:30:04 Evans: Okay. It went to Standby at 30.
Overmyer: Roger.
115:29:36 - This is Apollo Control at 115 hours, 30 minutes. Ron Evans in America has about 14½ minutes left before Loss of Signal on the 14th revolution. He's...
115:30:10 Evans: Mode is gone to HF. Recorder is Off. Lose a little comm here, huh? Maybe. Okay; there's Bravo. Select Omni. The High Gain at minus - Manual, Wide. Minus 10 and 25 for AOS.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron. We're still riding you - reading you loud...
115:31:08 Evans: Okay; good. And High Gain Antenna Power is going Off.
Overmyer: Roger.
Overmyer: We just want to give you some fair warning, Ron. When you come around AOS next time at 116:30, it's a - Flight Plan update. We got quite a lengthy update on the Flight Plan - all orbital picture work, but quite lengthy.
Evans: Okay. Are you going to try to pull that antenna back in first before we completely change the Flight Plan?
Overmyer: Ron, we're going to take a good hard look at that, and see if we can generate up either a test on that or what. That's kind of in limbo right now, Ron. These Flight Plan changes...
Evans: Oh, okay.
Overmyer: ...these Flight Plan changes I've got for you coming up later will be all some items Farouk has on camera pictures on the - that spot Jack thought he saw the light spot and a few other changes.
Evans: Oh, okay.
Overmyer: And, Ron, just for your information, regardless of what we do on that antenna, we won't have any Flight Plan changes until after 144 hours due to that antenna.
Evans: Oh! Okay.
Overmyer: Ron, we would like H2 tank 2 Fans to On.
115:34:00 Evans: H2 tank 2 Fans are On, now.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron. You're lucky you're up there tonight, Ron. We're having really ratty weather down here. Low clouds and rain and drizzle and cold.
Evans: Oh, really?
Overmyer: Yes. You walk - you walk outside, you just about can't see the top of building 2.
Evans: Gee whiz! Guess I picked a good time to be gone.
Overmyer: That's for sure.
115:35:27 Evans: Hey! You know, you'll never believe it. I'm right over the edge of Orientale. I just looked down and saw a light flash myself.
Overmyer: Roger. Understand.
Evans: Right at the end of the rille.
Overmyer: Any chance of...
Evans: That's on the east of Orientale.
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: You know, you don't suppose it could be - Vostog [?]
Evans: I'll be derned. I've got to mark that spot on the map.
115:36:34 - Ron Evans has just reported seeing a light flash just to the east of crater Orientale.
Overmyer: Ron, just before you leave, you're too bad to hear. You're looking good as you go around the horn, and we'll pick you up at 116:30. Voices will be pretty marginal the rest of the way out.
115:40:27 Evans: Just about to lose you.
Very long comm break.
115:45:15 - This is Apollo Control at 115 hours, 45 minutes. We've just had a Loss of Signal with America, which has now gone behind the Moon. We'll next acquire the Command Module at 116 hours, 30 minutes. All going well with Evans in America.
115:45:36 Evans (onboard): Spacecraft real time; PCM and real time will not be received.
115:52:25 Evans (onboard): Okay, the old Recorder going On. VHF reminding myself that it's On. Recorder's to VHF. Sounder to Operate. Stand by for 1 minute. Okay. Tape recorder [garble] I'm sure. No, no, wait.
Evans (onboard): Okay, [garble] to Operate. Stand by. Barber pole.
Evans (onboard): Change your [garble].
112:00:00 Evans (onboard): [Garble.] Stand by. Pull film for 1 minute. [Garble] 11 frames.
116:02:XX BEGIN LUNAR REV 15
116:34:45 Evans: Okay, Houston. This is America. Looks like you're with me now.
Overmyer: That's affirmative, America. We read you loud and clear.
Evans: Okay.
Overmyer: Did you get the Pan Camera start time there, Ron?
Evans: That's affirm. But, I got a 31:11 instead of 31:10.
Overmyer: Oh, Roger. No problem.
Evans: Okay. [Laughter.] I'll try to do better next time.
Overmyer: America, is the bird in good shape?
Evans: So far as I know.
Overmyer: Okay, great. Anytime you want to start taking a Flight Plan update, just let me know.
Evans: Okay. [Cough] Give me a little bit of time to lead into the landing site there, and we can go ahead and do it now.
Overmyer: Okay.
Overmyer: The first thing is at 119:00, 119:00. Add the following words, Ron: "Configure camera." In parenthesis, "Earthshine photos. CMS, Command Module 5 window/November Kilo. Nikon/55/VHBW." That's Victor Hotel Bravo Whiskey.
Evans: Okay.
Overmyer: In parenthesis; f/1.2, 1, infinity, end of parenthesis. Eighteen frames FR - 18 FR.
Evans: Good.
Overmyer: Magazine Zulu Zulu.
Evans: Okay, got it.
Overmyer: Okay. Go down to 119:24 and add the following. Let me just read it to you in - quickly here, so you can put in the words you want to. The words are "Point at target marked by LMP. Use same technique as for Copernicus central peak."
Evans: Okay. We'll point at the target by the LMP. Use the same technique, which is starting out at 1 second...
Overmyer: Roger. Let me read it to you.
Evans: ...was it 30 seconds?
Overmyer: Roger. 1 second, two frames; ½ second, two frames; ¼ second, two frames; 1/8 second, two frames; 1/16 second, two frames. On Copernicus, we're using a 30-second interval. It's not important, - the interval. It's mainly just the stop settings on that. You're going to use a total of 10 frames.
Evans: Okay.
Overmyer: Okay, then add the following after that: After completion of above, switch to window CB3. For 8 frame of end of target, Papa 17 Delta. At 30-second intervals. Record frame number.
116:39:52 Evans: Okay, I've got to switch to window number 3 for end of target. Say again, the target number.
Overmyer: P, as in Papa; 17 Delta, D as in Delta. 17 Delta.
Evans: Okay, Papa 17 Delta.
Overmyer: As 30-second intervals.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron. There is a caution note on this. It's a note concerning the frame usage.
Evans: Seems to me like Zebra Zebra only has 18 frames, doesn't it?
Overmyer: That's affirm. Do not exceed 18 frames. The balance of mag Zebra Zebra was used for preflight calibration. Do not exceed 18 frames. You can put that down any way you want it.
Evans: Okay.
Overmyer: Okay. Under rev 17, I've got a note - a similar note, Ron, for rev 17.
Evans: Okay.
Overmyer: The note is, do not exceed 40 frames on Earthshine mag Whiskey Whiskey. Balance of magazine was used for preflight cal. I'll say again, do not exceed 40 frames on Earthshine mag Whiskey Whiskey.
Evans: Okay, on mag Whiskey Whiskey don't exceed 40 frames. The balance is already on calibration.
Overmyer: That's affirmative. And I've got three notes then, Ron, just general notes - may come up in the crew film area. Mag Papa Papa for crew option. Just use mag Papa Papa for crew option. Do not use Kilo Kilo for crew option. Do not use Kilo Kilo for crew option. The last one is save all the remaining VHBW on Quebec Quebec and Romeo Romeo for scheduled photos. We have a very small margin on each.
VHBW is very high-speed black & white film, typically rated at 6,000 ASA.
Overmyer: [Garble] end of update.
Evans: That was - Okay, save all remaining on Quebec Quebec. And what was the other one, Jack?
Overmyer: Romeo Romeo.
Evans: Okay, no extras on those two, then - on the VHBW, huh?
Overmyer: Yes, we got a very small margin on those now. And, you're about 10 minutes prior to landing site orbital. Why don't you go over and start studying that, if you want?
116:43:20 Evans: Okay.
Long comm break.
116:51:52 Evans: You know you look at - next to Macrobius A, there is a kind of a dark halo-type crater there. Very small one. And it doesn't have the appearance of a hummocky crater rim to it, at all. It looks like the material just kind of spreads out all over the area, but it doesn't have a hummocky appearance to it. I'm going to take a look at that again when I come back - on back around on the other side. There's a small mound down in the bottom of the crater, also. It's a domical-shaped structure in the bottom of that small crater. It's right next to J3. North of J3.
Overmyer: Roger, Ron.
Evans: Coming in, I can see the landing site, now - quite well. The appearance of the slide area definitely shows up. The South Massif seems to have the Sun shining right on the walls. I'm looking for any type of layering, or anything like that. And can't see anything that - that would show that up. The big difference between the massif structures and the Sculptured Hills is that the massifs look like they are a steeper slope. And they - they don't seem to have that type of covering over them, like the Sculptured Hills do.
Evans: I'm right over now. The scarp definitely cuts up through the North Massif. I can't see continuation on into the South Massif at all. But, you can definitely see a vertical exaggeration as it cuts on around up over the North Massif. And it's almost - I'd have to take another look at it for sure, but it almost looks like a flow coming from Family - or in the vicinity - in the direction of Family Mountain - but from the direction of Family Mountain - lapping up on the side of the North Massif. That's the way it looks as you go on by it. I couldn't see anything that would lead you to believe that the slide area, so to speak, would come on across anything that would be the source of that slide area. I still think I can see the - one spot that has a lighter albedo than the surrounding area there in the Pentagon complex. And it's pretty close to the - Let me get my chart out here and take a look at it again.
116:56:50 Evans: No, it still looks like that area that's blown away there is Dog November - between Dog November and Dog Papa. And about 83.4 or something like that.
116:57:07 Overmyer: Copy.
Evans: Yes, just like the map shows, and all the pictures, you've got a definite demarcation in the annulus around Serenitatis here, as you look by Sulpicius Gallus area. As you look at it - I'm going to have to take another check on it - but the dark annulus looks to me like it's raised above the mare, proper, itself. I'll check that a little more as we come on across.
Evans: You know all those rilles to the north of - I mean to the west of Sulpicius Gallus. There is a bunch of crisscrossing. One is right on the edge of the Serenitatis basin - and I don't remember the name of that crater, I'll have to look it up later - but they've got slightly raised rims around the rilles. You can see some layering down inside the rille itself, in the east-west and the one that runs in the east-west direction.
Overmyer: Roger. You're talking about near Menelaus?
Evans: Yes, I'll have to look on the map and see for sure what the crater is, but there's an impact crater right on the edge of Serenitatis basin - right on the terminator. Right now.
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: And then those rilles are just to the north of that crater.
Overmyer: Roger. That's probably Menelaus - M-e-n-e-l-a-u-s - Menelaus.
Evans: I think it is.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron. Is the Pan Camera, Off? T-stop time. Pan Camera to Standby. T-stop time.
Evans: Okay. Is it now?
Overmyer: Roger. You're just a little bit past it.
Evans: Oh, Okay, thank you. [Chuckle.] Okay, Pan Camera - Standby. Thank you. That's the first chance I had to look at the Moon, you know. These guys...
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: ...let me look at the windows.
Overmyer: That's all right. We don't mind calling you, if you don't mind getting the call.
Evans: (Chuckle) No, not in the least.
Overmyer: Ron, I'll give you a cue here shortly for Pan Camera - Off. I just want you to know, we will not be retracting the Mapping Camera; and, therefore, we will not be closing the Mapping Camera, Laser Altimeter cover. But we will be dumping normally. Over.
Evans: Okay. We're going to dump with the mapper open, is what you're saying, huh?
Overmyer: That's affirmative.
Evans: Okay.
Evans: You know it looks to me like it all disappears anyhow. It just kind of leaves the spacecraft. I don't think anything comes around or even sticks around.
Overmyer: Roger, Ron.
117:02:03 Overmyer: At your convenience, High Gain to Auto.
Evans: You have High Gain to Auto.
Overmyer: Thank you, sir.
Evans: Okay, it's orbital science photos coming up here. Do you want to use magazine KK still? Or should we finish up Oscar Oscar?
Overmyer: Stand by, Ron. Checking with Tommy on that one.
Overmyer: Ron, they'd like you to use mag KK on that.
Evans: Okay.
Overmyer: While you're looking at the Flight Plan there, at 117:20 where that Mapping Camera stuff - just delete Mapping Camera, retract; and Mapping Camera, Laser Altimeter cover, closed at 117:15.
Evans: Okay. Delete Mapping Camera, retract; and Mapping Camera, Laser Altimeter, closed. Okay.
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: Okay, magazine KK is starting with 21 pictures.
Overmyer: Roger. We copy.
Evans: Okay. Bob, if - would you give me a call when you get ready for that Mapping Camera stuff? I was kind of shoved off this morning, and I got to sample their buses.
Overmyer: Yes. Roger, Ron. We'll give you a call - first one will probably be a Pan Camera call here shortly, and then I'll call you when it's time for those H2 purge line heaters - things like that.
117:06:20 Evans: Okay.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron, Pan Camera Power to Off.
117:08:22 Evans: Okay, Pan Camera Power - Let's see. Pan Camera Power is Off.
Overmyer: Thank you, sir.
Evans: Good.
Evans: Hey, this is not so bad, if you think of iced tea, I guess.
Overmyer: Roger.
Overmyer: Just for your information, Ron. Gene's out on the surface right now.
Evans: Oh, they are? Hey, great!
Evans: Did they confirm my position yet?
Overmyer: I don't - Let me check here - I don't think we have it pinned down exactly. You're pretty darn close to it. That's for sure.
117:12:25 Evans: You know, it's funny. It wasn't as bright - That pass over - This last pass - as it was the time before.
Long comm break.
117:21:05 Overmyer: I hope you haven't - I hope you haven't spilled any; and, by the way, LMP is on the surface now, too.
Overmyer: America, Houston. You can go with the H2O Purge Heaters now.
Overmyer: America, Houston.
Evans: Houston, America. Go ahead.
Overmyer: Roger. You can go with the H2 Purge Line Heaters and the rest of that Flight Plan.
Evans: Okay. What do you know? The Purge Line Heaters have been On.
Overmyer: Roger. We kind of suspected that.
Evans: Okay. [Laughter.] Okay. Let's see. Mapping Camera can come Off. Thirty seconds.
117:25:31 Evans: Okay, Mapping Camera is going to Standby. IM Pitch Motion is Off. Altimeter - Laser Altimeter - is Off. UV is Off. IR is Off. Okay, UV cover - box. UV Cover is Closed; barber pole, gray. IR Cover is Closed; barber pole, gray. Okay, Map Camera Laser Altimeter - we'll leave that one Open.
Overmyer: Good show, Ron.
Evans: Okay. Then it's my understanding you don't want to do any dumping until I go on the back side of the Moon. Is that correct?
Overmyer: That's affirm, Ron.
Evans: Okay.
Overmyer: According to the Flight Plan, you do it at 117:50. Right about that time.
Evans: Okay. Will do.
117:28:23 Evans: Bob, one little notice. Supplies I had this morning. Might made notes, so I wouldn't forget about it. It was when you go to tunnel vent, it takes a heck of a long time to vent that tunnel. In the simulator down there, you go to tunnel vent, and it flips right down and vents. And I was beginning to wonder if it - if it was leaking or something.
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: As it turned out, as it turns out, it worked out all right. But I bet it took a good 10 minutes, - to get up to 3.5. Before I could turn the jets back on, you know.
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: Go, that's ready to go.
Overmyer: Ron, just one reminder as we go around the horn here. The waste water - the way - the position it is in will probably take between 10 and 12 minutes to dump it completely. Or dump it to your 10 percent number.
Evans: Okay, that's good. Oh, glad I don't have anybody watching for me this time. Do I?
Overmyer: Yes, that's right. We won't be able to call you on that. When it's down to 8 percent.
Evans: [Laughter.] Okay, I'll put my old timer on.
Overmyer: Hey, Ron, one other reminder. We know it's in the Flight Plan, but you may get real busy just prior to that orbital science photos. And EECOM would like to make sure you get the H2 purge line heaters, Off, as scheduled, at 118:02.
Evans: Okay. Okay, is she in there? Yes - it's in the Flight Plan. Okay.
117:33:21 Overmyer: Roger; it's in the Flight Plan. But it's just before you're going to get busy on that orbital science photo. You might of - you might go to the window earlier or something.
Evans: Okay. It's a good point.
Overmyer: And your friends out on the surface have the Rover out now and - starting to load it up and getting ready to check it out.
Evans: Hey, great!
Overmyer: The surface work is going really good. They're just a little bit behind the time line from their suiting-up exercise. But it doesn't make a whole lot of difference.
Evans: Uhuh. Uhuh. 250 lens on that thing.
117:38:19 Overmyer: Ron, you're 5 minutes to LOS here. And you're looking real good all around the room. No problems with any of the systems that we can see. We'll see it at 118:29. And we'll be with you for another 5 minutes here.
Evans: 118:29, okay. Okay, we're going to have a little grape drink.
Overmyer: Just remember what Jan says. Don't spill it on your flight suit.
Evans: [Laughter.] Right.
Evans: Did I miss lunch? Or wasn't I supposed to get any lunch today?
Overmyer: I don't know, that wasn't on my shift. But if you're hungry, why don't you eat something?
Evans: [Laughter.] That's what I'm doing.
Overmyer: It's been a long time since lunch...
Evans: I'm nibbling.
Evans: Yes. Long time since breakfast, I think, wasn't it?
Overmyer: Yes, I think it was. And you got about 4 more hours until scheduled eat time. So - you got some Lunar Sounder work there - and about 119 or so, so you might as well consider eating a lot.
Evans: Yes, I could eat dinner. I'm kind of nibbling a little bit.
Overmyer: Just want to make sure you don't lose your scissors, too.
Evans: Yes. This time I got them snapped to the hand controller and stuck in the little thing around it. I don't know how I've lost those things.
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: I didn't like that big string on there all the time. I didn't like that big string getting all over the place. So I rolled the string on the strap, and stuck the scissors in that little bungee that's on the hand controller. I woke up the next morning and they're gone. I still think it's behind the optics.
Overmyer: Just don't go look at them; okay? We'll find them pre - postflight. Okay?
Evans: Okay.
Overmyer: Hey, Ron. I don't know what Tommy has against you, but they just never scheduled an eat period in here. We checked this out so thoroughly that, we forgot to check it to see if there was an eat period in there.
Evans: We probably weren't hungry when we checked it out.
117:40:54 Overmyer: Roger.
117:41:19 Overmyer: You've got a Lunar Sounder HF pass at 1 - starting - at 119, for a site - well, actually a 2-hour, no, 1-hour that you could probably grab some food at that time.
Evans: Okay.
Very long comm break.
117:59:XX BEGIN LUNAR REV 16
118:31:12 Overmyer: America, Houston.
Evans: Houston, America. Go ahead.
Overmyer: Okay. Just wanted to make sure you're there. Your friends are out on the surface, and we've got a live TV picture coming from the Moon.
Evans: Hey, great!
Overmyer: And Bob just passed word that they just dropped the scissors up there, but they found them under the dirt awhile. Anyway, they almost lost a pair of scissors.
Evans: [Laughter.] Oh, come on now. They've only got one pair, too, I think. Unless both of them ended up over there.
Overmyer: Get some good pictures of Aitken there, Ron?
Evans: Yes, I sure did.
Overmyer: Out of curiosity...
Evans: Almost missed [garble] picture.
Overmyer: Roger. When you came by Arabia, could you see the subdued rings of Arabia?
Evans: You know, I haven't had a real chance to look at those yet.
Overmyer: Roger.
118:33:16 Evans: Okay. Magazine SS is full.
Overmyer: Roger. We copy.
Overmyer: Ron, any time you're ready, I've got a TEI-26 PAD and an Earth - Earthshine photo PAD.
Evans: Let's see. [Humming.]
Overmyer: Ron, if you've got half-scale on your High Gain, will you go to Reacq and Narrow?
118:34:50 Evans: Okay. Good idea. Reacq and Narrow.
Overmyer: Good show, Ron.
Evans: [Whistling.]
Evans: Okay. Let's see. I guess I ought to do a TEI. What did you say it was, 26?
Overmyer: That's affirm, Ron. TEI-26.
Evans: Okay. Ready to copy.
118:35:51 Overmyer: TEI-26, SPS/G&N; 37630; plus 0.53, plus 0.97; 139:41:14.32; Noun 81's plus 2450.7, minus 2097.8, minus 0807.1. Roll is 187; pitch, 104; yaw, 323; rest of the PAD is not applicable. Good old Sirius and Rigel for set stars; 133, 200, 030. Ullage, four jet, 12 seconds. Longitude of the Moon at TIG will be minus 160.39. Over.
Evans: Okay. Say again the longitude.
Overmyer: Roger, Ron. It's minus - minus 160.39.
118:37:37 Evans: Okay. Readback. TEI-26, SPS/G&N; 37630; plus 0.53, plus 0.97; 139:41:14.32; and 81's plus 2450.7, minus 2097.8, minus 0807.1. Roll 187, 104, 323. Sirius and Rigel; 133, 200, 030. Four jet, 12 seconds. Lunar longitude at TIG is minus 160.39.
Interpretation of the PAD is as follows:
Purpose: This is an abort PAD for an early return home at the end of the 26th orbit if there is a problem that would end the mission.
System: The burn would use the SPS engine under the control of the Guidance and Navigation system.
CSM Weight (Noun 47): 37,630 pounds (17,069 kg).
Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48): +0.53° and +0.97°.
Time of ignition, TIG (Noun 33): 139 hours, 41 minutes, 14.32 seconds.
Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s): X, +2,450.7 (+747.0); Y, -2,097.8 (-639.4); Z, -807.1 (-246.0). These velocity components are expressed with respect to the local vertical frame of reference.
Spacecraft attitude: Roll, 187°; Pitch, 104°; Yaw, 323°. The attitude angles are given with respect to the current REFSMMAT.
GDC Align stars: Stars 15, (Sirius, Alpha Canis Majoris) and 12, (Rigel, Beta Orionis) are to be used to align the gyro assemblies if it is not possible to use the guidance platform for this purpose.
GDC Align angles: x, 133°; y, 200°; z, 30°.
There are two additional notes. SPS propellants are settled in their tanks by firing the plus-X thrusters on all four quads around the Service Module for 12 seconds. At the moment of ignition, the spacecraft would be passing a longitude 160.39°W
118:38:17 Overmyer: Good readback, Ron. And the Earthshine photo PAD is at 121:05 in the Flight Plan.
Evans: Okay. Stand by just a second. 121:05, huh?
Overmyer: That's affirmative.
Evans: Okay. Have it.
Overmyer: Roger. T-start, 121:03:59.
Evans: Okay. T-start, 121:03:59.
118:39:01 Overmyer: And, Ron, we'd like the Recorder, On, on the Lunar Sounder.
118:39:09 Evans: Okay. Recorder, On.
Evans: [Humming.]
118:46:24 Overmyer: Just talked to the homefront, Ron. And I guess some of you guys will do anything to get out of - get away from putting up...
Evans: Roger.
Overmyer: ...outdoor Christmas decorations. All the neighbors are outside putting up your Christmas decorations tonight. It's pretty bad when you have to travel thousands of miles to...
Evans: Well, I'll be darned. That's - [Laughter] Yes. That's pretty darn nice of the neighbors, though, I think.
Overmyer: And the Putnams got home, so you got the whole - whole neighborhood back now.
Evans: Gee whiz.
118:47:48 Evans: Okay. Finally got mag ZZ on the ole Nikon.
Overmyer: Roger. Looking at the Flight Plan, Ron, you're coming up on selecting Omni Bravo and setting up the High Gain and pow - powering it Off; and getting ready for the Lunar Sounder receive only section here.
Evans: Okay. [Humming.]
118:49:52 Evans: Okay; 49. Omni Bravo. And set the High Gain Manual and Wide, minus 74.
118:50:11 - The Command Module is over the landing site.
Overmyer: And, Ron, your friends down here said that they could hear you on the VHF loud and clear.
Evans: [Laughter.] Very good. I was just curious. I don't hear them. I thought maybe I could hear them. Yes, have a ball down there, guys.
118:53:40 Overmyer: Okay, Ron. We're - It looks like we're about 30 seconds in front of Operate. Right there on Operate.
Evans: Okay.
Overmyer: And we're not going to have a number - any calls here for a good 40 minutes, so this is a good time to catch up on your meal regimen there if you want, Ron.
Evans: [Laughter.] Okay.
119:00:59 Overmyer: Ron, when you get a chance, we'd like H2 Tank 3 Fan to Off.
119:01:09 Evans: Okay. H2 Tank 3 Fans are Off.
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: Hey, Bob. Did Jack call down where that flash is - where he saw that light flash?
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: Okay. I've got a mark next to Riccioli G - Riccioli Golf. Is that correct?
Overmyer: That's affirmative. We - we circled it - at Grimaldi B and the east and north of Grimaldi B, right in that area.
Evans: Okay. We've put it just - got a little X about the diameter of Riccioli G, to the west of Riccioli G.
Overmyer: Okay. That's probably...
Evans: [Garble] west of it.
Overmyer: That's probably - he didn't ever call the - I'll ask FAO here, but I don't think he ever called the actual - coordinates on it. I'll ask FAO. That's probably close enough. They'll probably all be in the picture anyway, wouldn't it?
Evans: Oh, yes. They'll all be in the picture anyhow.
Evans: You'll never believe it, but I saw lightning flash down there too. I don't know. That last rev. Did you hear that?
Overmyer: Roger. We heard that, Ron. The thought that occurs to us, should you be seeing the - those cosmic ray flashes just while you're looking at the lunar surface and getting that effect?
Evans: Yes, that's what I'm wondering myself, you know.
Overmyer: As Charlie said, he mentioned he'd seen something similar to that and possibly thought it was that. And we were thinking that maybe what it was with Jack, but it won't hurt to take a picture of the area anyway.
Evans: Well, I think we'll try taking a picture of it, but I think I tend to agree with you. That's probably what it was.
Overmyer: We're just guessing just like anybody else on that. We're just - just guessing on it, Ron.
Evans: [Laughter.] Okay. Nothing showing up on the seismometer anyhow [garble].
Overmyer: Well, you have to remember on the seismometer, on at least the one for Jack's call, the S-IVB had just clobbered the seismometer, and - and that there was something small impact that when the - it was in the mud, you wouldn't have seen it.
Evans: Oh, okay; sure.
119:07:58 Overmyer: Ron, I know you're wondering. All the data so far on the Lunar Sounder has come out real good, and the HF pass is looking real good.
Evans: Oh, that's dandy! Hey, that's great!
Evans: Let's hope something is going on the film.
Overmyer: That's - that's Roger on that. We sure hope so.
Evans: [Laughter.] Oh, I'm sure it is.
Overmyer: You take another look at Copernicus, or did you eat during the test?
Evans: Just stuck my head out the window. I've got to find it. There it is, right here.
Evans: Oh, boy. Just wasn't quite light adapted there. I'm not sure if you could really tell [garble] going through there or not.
Overmyer: Roger. Understand.
Evans: You know, light and dark albedos show up real well. You can see some indication of terrain; that is, hilliness or burrows or - or grabens or rilles. Of course, the fresh craters show up a - lot wider with respect to the surrounding territory than I think they do in the - on the bright side, you know? With the Sun shining on them.
Overmyer: Roger.
119:13:20 Overmyer: Gene became the first auto-mechanic on the Moon as one of the rear fenders fell off the Rover right after they deployed it, so he had to tape it on with some tape.
Evans: [Laughter.] Oh, he did? Well, they were pretty much sure those things were going to fall off anyhow.
Overmyer: Yes, they were willing to bet on it.
119:13:35 Evans: You can't pack them in there, you have to - yes...

119:19:29 Evans: Well, I can see Reiner Gamma real well out window 3.
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: I should be able to get back the next rev, I guess.
Overmyer: Roger. Look like a gamma up there? Is that why they call it a gamma?
Evans: Hey, that sure does. Oddly enough, it almost looks like an elongated crater in this - in this light.
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: You know, with the gamma part of it and the - being the crater rim.
Overmyer: Rog.
Evans: I'm sure it is that way.
Overmyer: Now, we've got both of - we got two - or a number of picture-taking sections here next rev, but we got that sequence on Copernicus and that sequence on Reiner Gamma there.
Evans: Aha. Okay.
Evans: And now, I'll see if I can find Riccioli.
Evans: I should be able to see Grimaldi, I think.
Overmyer: Getting pretty easy to locate yourself as you go along your track?
Evans: Yeah, it's starting to get that way. It's not as good as I - as I want it yet. Every once in awhile, you look out of the window, you don't have the slightest idea where you are [chuckle].
Overmyer: Right.
Comm break.
Evans: Yeah, I can see Grimaldi and Riccioli coming up now. Just passing over the edge of the mare [garble].
Overmyer: Roger. That's Grimaldi mare there?
Evans: Yeah, I can see it coming up.
Overmyer: Okay.
Evans: There's a pretty stark difference between the mare and the - I guess you might as well go ahead and call them highlands, that's what they look like.
Evans: East of Procellarum, in fact just before you get to Grimaldi.

Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: Getting too much glare on the windows.
Comm break.
Evans: Okay, Bob. That is correct. Now, you want to continue on across here at a 15th, huh?

119:28:53 Overmyer: Okay, Ron. No [garble] for picture taking, but you need to select Omni A when you get a chance.
Evans: Okay.
Evans: There you go.
Overmyer: Good show.
Evans: Say, I can only take 18 pictures on that, I think.
Overmyer: Say again, Ron.
Evans: It'll only take 18 pictures, I think.
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: It's - [laughter] Fool around in here by yourself, and you get disoriented.

119:34:05 Evans: Well, I didn't see any slices down there that time.
Overmyer: Roger.
Overmyer: Hey, you're looking good, Ron. You're right on the Flight Plan. We haven't missed a thing yet today, I don't think. In really good shape.
Evans: Oh, okay. Good. I tell you, there's a little more hustling up here than I thought there would be though.
Overmyer: Keeping you busy, huh?
Evans: [Laughter] Yeah, a little bit. That's all right. It's fun.
Overmyer: Just don't want you to get lonely up there.
Evans: [Laughter] Sure won't.
Evans: Okay. That was mag Zebra Zebra, I guess. Started out just like we had it planned. Took two each in 1 second and a half, and then a fourth, and then an eighth. And turns out that this camera [garble] 1/15 instead of 1/16.
Overmyer: Back at 150.
Evans: And then the rest of them...
Overmyer: Yeah.
Evans: ...And then the rest of them are one sixth - one fifteenth throughout, except the last two, put at a half.
Overmyer: Okay.
Overmyer: I'll get a confirmation on some, Ron, but I think when we get on to Reiner Gamma on that pass of target 15 Delta, we're not going to have enough film left to run out over Riccioli and that area, which is already taken. That's why we hate to take these now, because when - when we come up there in the next pass, you're not going to have enough film.
Evans: Oh, I see. Okay.
Evans: Let's see. While I got the camera out, I can look ahead, I guess, and see what - what mag, to put in there.
Evans: WW, I guess, huh?
Overmyer: Yeah, that's affirm. WW on the lunar [garble].
Evans: Okay. I'll give you that.
Overmyer: Ron, comm is getting pretty bad down here with us, we're going to lose you in about 4 minutes, maybe 5, completely. And we'll pick you back up at - 120:28 thereabouts, 120:28.
Evans: 120:28. Okay. We'll see you there.
Overmyer: Roger.

Lobachevsky is a crater on the far side.
120:30:05 Overmyer: Hello, Ron. How's it going up there?
Evans: Hey, pretty good, Robert. The last photo pass was a - a good one.

Overmyer: Roger, Ron. We'll give you a call. You can go Omni Bravo now, Ron.
Evans: [Laughter] Okay. Do you have it?
Overmyer: Okeydoke.
The following four utterances are not recorded on the audio supplied by NARA.
120:48:27 Evans: ...within the crater rim.
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: But I'm sure it isn't that way.
Overmyer: Yes, we've got...
The NARA recording picks up from the following utterance.
Overmyer: Ron, if you're right there, we'd like you to take the H2 tank 2 Fans to Off, please.
120:49:42 Evans: Okay. H2 tank 2 Fans to Off.
Evans: You know, from the pictures of Maraldi Gamma, looked to me like it might have been some sort of a - a - well, maybe even a volcanic dome or some kind. Now when you look at it up there now and compare it with the rest of the surrounding material, it looks just like any other - any of the other sculptured hills. They have small domical structures on it. It's the same type of material that carries on through south of Maraldi. And it looks like maybe some kind of a mare fill has come in and filled up Maraldi itself. You can see flow lines, it looks like, going down into Maraldi from Tranquillitatis. Now - The impact - or the craters that are inside Maraldi, they're smaller-type craters and they have a - they have a definite bluish tinge to the halo that comes out as opposed to the bright - most of the bright craters or white-type thing and those are - have more of a bl - a darkish bluish tin - tinge to them. And...
Overmyer: Thank you, Ron.
Evans: ...oddly enough, that's the same type of - That's the same type of bluish tinge that I see right in the landing site right now. In the Pentagon complex, MOCR shows up that - that same type of a bluish tinge to it.
Overmyer: Roger. Did you have any luck locating the LM area in the landing site this time?
Evans: Yeah, I don't even see the bright spot there anymore. I know - I know where to look for it and I don't even see it.
Overmyer: Rog. Understand.
120:50:30 Evans: Well, South Massif just went into a hole, too, so...
Overmyer: Roger. Our best estimate of their location down here. Ron is - 83 - Delta Mike 83. Delta Mike 83.
Evans: Delta Mike 83, huh?
Overmyer: Yeah, and that's - that's seen on the southeast sheet - the FE sheet with the landing site and the first EVA on it. The one, the 25,000 grid map on the - one of those you had put in at the last minute there.
Evans: Okay.
Overmyer: And I assume you're set up for these pictures coming up at 121, right?
Evans: Yep. It's funny, I can see Bessel, but I'll be durn if I can see a Copernican ray going across it - I mean a Tycho ray going - Copernican ray, I guess.
Overmyer: I think you were right the first time, weren't you?
Evans: Yeah, it's a Tycho ray.
Overmyer: Ron, I'm sorry we missed this last time. If you'll give me a hack when you start on the Earthshine photos on P17, the Copernicus one, I'll - I'll time your 30 seconds for you down here and save you looking at the clock. And...
Evans: Oh, okay. Hey, that's a good idea.
Overmyer: I guess even though the start time we passed and everything is the time, Farouk wanted to remind you that when you pass Eratosthenes is a good time to be looking into the heart of Copernicus, there. If you'll remember from the map, there.
Evans: Okay. Hey, that's a good idea; thank you.

120:56:28 Overmyer: Were you able to see the Sul- Sulpicius Gallus Ridge there, Ron?
Evans: Yeah, man oh man. That thing really sticks up there.
Evans: I'm trying to estimate the height of it with respect to one of those craters down there, but - I - I still can't get over the - the difference in the color and the annulus around Serenitatis. And that thing is really apparent.
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: And it looks like - the color - the color distinction - stops right at this ridge here, just as we're going into the sunset right now.
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: I'm trying to determine a - a flow with respect to those ridges, if there is such a thing.
Evans: I'll have to look at it again when I come around the next time. Okay, QQ's got 69 frames.
Overmyer: Roger.

121:01:48 Overmyer: Okay, Ron. You're about 2 minutes from T-start time, but again bias your T-start time with respect to the crater Eratosthenes.
Evans: Okay. Why don't you just kind of give me a - quick gouge when I should be at Eratosthenes [chuckle].
Overmyer: Okay. I'll give a call and, of course, your first frame is...
Evans: I think I'll...
Overmyer: ...first frame is f/1.2 for 1 second and you'll take two frames.
Evans: Okay.
121:03:27 Overmyer: Okay, Ron. You're about 30 seconds from T-start time.
121:03:45 Evans: Okay. I think I got her.
Overmyer: Okay, just give me a call when you start. You're about l0 seconds out, now.
Evans: Okay. Stand by 3, 2, 1...
121:03:59 Evans: Mark it.
121:04:08 - Ron Evans is coming up over the crater Copernicus in his 17th revolution of the Moon. He's right on the Flight Plan. Everything going good. Sounder data coming in good.
Evans: Okay; switch to a half.
Overmyer: Okay, coming up on 30 seconds.
121:04:27 Overmyer: Mark it.
Evans: Okay, got it. The fourth.
Overmyer: Okay, coming up on another 30 second, here...
121:04:57 Overmyer: Mark it.
Evans: Okay. Okay, I'm down to 1/15. I'm just now passing it, Bob. So there's a one on 1/15.
Overmyer: Okay, you're one ahead on the figure. You should be at 1/8...
Evans: Two on the 15...
Overmyer: ...right now.
Evans: ...I'll start my time from there. Yeah, I've - I've already passed it so I had to get them quick [chuckle].
Overmyer: Okay, there you are 1/8 there.
Evans: Okay, tell me when to - Okay.
Evans: Okay. The rest of them 1/8?
Overmyer: No, at 1/16 or 1/15.
Evans: Okay. Give me a time hack every 30 seconds.
Overmyer: Well - okay.
Evans: Or whenever, tell me to switch windows.
121:06:00 Overmyer: Hack it.
Overmyer: Coming up on 30 seconds.
121:06:30 Overmyer: Mark it.
Overmyer: Coming up on another mark, Ron.
121:07:00 Overmyer: Hack it.
Evans: Okay.
Overmyer: Just a reminder, the end of this line goes up to Encke and Kepler; you've probably reviewed that.
Evans: Okay.
Overmyer: Coming up on another mark.
121:07:30 Overmyer: Hack.
Overmyer: Coming up on our other mark.
121:07:58 Overmyer: Mark it.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron.
121:08:30 Overmyer: Mark it.
Evans: Pictures in here. Okay.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron. You'll he coming up on another mark here.
121:08:57 Overmyer: Mark it.
Evans: Got it.
Overmyer: Okay, according to my calculations you've got two more sets of two frames each to take. You've taken 20 and you've got four more to go, I believe.
Evans: Okay, I want to get some for Reiner Gamma right?
Overmyer: Roger. As soon as you do that, you just switch windows to the north side and - Reiner Gamma - You got two more to go. Here we go. Coming up on another 30 seconds.
Evans: Okay.
121:09:29 Overmyer: Mark it. You probably should be able to see Encke out there now. That's your last target there.
Evans: Okay. Switch over to window 3, then.
Overmyer: Okay. Did you take that last one on Encke or you got two more to go on Encke there?
Evans: [Garble] I've got - I've only got 19 frames left so...
Overmyer: Okay. That's the last [garble] it marked there.
Evans: Same thing on the Eratosthenes? Okay.
Overmyer: Okay, Ron. On these Reiner Gamma pictures, you don't have to wait 30 seconds. You just shoot the frames as soon as you get it in view there. Shoot two frames at 1 second, two at ½, two at ¼, and two at 1/8.
Evans: Okay. Would you - would you believe that's what I did on Eratosthenes and also on Copernicus?
Overmyer: Rog. That's what you're supposed to do on Copernicus so you remembered better than me on that one. It wasn't 30 seconds...
Evans: [Laughter.]
Overmyer: ...until after Copernicus.
Evans: Yeah. Well, I made a mistake too. I thought Eratosthenes was Copernicus. But anyhow we got - we got a series on Eratosthenes and also a series on Copernicus. So we're in good shape.
Overmyer: Okay. You should be seeing Gamma about now, shouldn't you?
Evans: Yeah, but I don't see it yet.
Overmyer: Okay.
Overmyer: Ron, you can just run this mag all the way out to frame 40. After you finish on Gamma, you just continue on out that line up towards Riccioli; and - and then run out to frame 40 and stow it.
121:12:19 Evans: Okay; will do.
Long comm break.
121:16:54 Evans: Okay. Got her in sight now.

Evans: Okay. All but one picture and I was going to try to take one of Orientale. I've saved one there just for right on the edge.
Overmyer: Okay.
Evans: So I'm just kind of looking out the window now. Why, do you have some Flight Plan stuff?
Overmyer: I've only got one minor Flight Plan and that's all so any time you're ready, don't - you know, don't tear yourself away from the window as long as you can see anything here.
Evans: Okay.
Overmyer: We would like you to select Omni Alpha.
121:27:30 Evans: Omni Alpha.
Overmyer: And, if you're looking at anything and you can see anything interesting, we wouldn't mind hearing about it.
Evans: Okay.
Evans: The big difference right in here, of course, is the - the ejecta and the radial furrows and ridges and what have you from Orientale - there isn't - doesn't seem to be that type of a pattern at all on the back side.
Overmyer: Roger. Understand.

121:30:27 Overmyer: Can you still see - see things in Earthshine or is it getting pretty black down there?
Evans: Actually, you know. You can still see it. That's what kind of amazes me. It's almost like - you know, sunrise and sunset.
Overmyer: Roger.
Evans: Pretty soon, the shadows get longer and longer.
Overmyer: I tell you, we got the television screen here of the...
121:31:07 Evans: Okay; that's my last picture off.
Overmyer: Roger. You're going to have a couple of dirty companions when they come back up, I'll tell you.
Evans: [Laughter] What are they doing? Getting all dirty?
Overmyer: Well, I think they've each fallen a couple of times, and they're black all over.
Evans: Yeah, it looked like a dark area down there.
Overmyer: Well, they sure are dirty. Okay, Ron, I - in the Flight Plan at 133:12, way on ahead, you just might mark this down somewhere. It's a real simple - "Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover, Open," and "Mapping Camera, Extend," you'll just delete those since they're already there.
Evans: Okay. Let's see - where was that now, about 131, Bob?
Overmyer: 133:12. It's in the other volume, in the next volume of the Flight Plan.
Evans: Oh, [chuckle] I'll just write it down, I don't have that volume out.
Overmyer: Yes, just mapping - it's delete the "Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover, Open," and "Mapping Camera - Extend." Just delete those two functions. You remember it's already out and the cover's staying open because it's out.
Evans: Oh, okay. And that's about 131, huh?
Overmyer: 133:12, 133:12.
Evans: Okay. 133 plus 12.
Overmyer: And, Ron. We made a trip around the room here and the CSM systems are all Go. They all look good and the Lunar Sounder is looking good also.
Evans: Hey. Real fine. I guess I'll grab a bite to eat then here pretty quick.
Overmyer: Yeah, do that, will you? Sorry you missed another one.
Evans: [Laughter.] Oh, I filled in, every once in a while so that's not too bad.
Overmyer: Good enough.
Overmyer: And just a reminder, which is in the Flight Plan, DSE voice recorded at the back side will not be dumped - so...
Evans: Oh, okay.
Overmyer: And, Ron, the reason why we've got all the H2 Fans, Off, now is we're trying to get the pressures to drop some and we'll come up with a sleep configuration this next half.
121:34:12 Evans: Oh, okay.

Evans: I'm really just eating.
Overmyer: Rog. Just thought I'd update here before you get into your presleep checklist ... Have a little bit of news from the day, but today's...
Evans: Oh, okay.
Overmyer: ...sure not much news today. It's a good thing you guys made the landing today, because there wouldn't be any news in the paper tomorrow if it wasn't for you all.
Evans: [Laughter.]
Overmyer: Let's see. Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka's Liberal Democrats lost 26 seats, but he still has a firm hold upon the Diet, and Tanaka still has a firm majority. And Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho's secret Paris peace talks have bogged down some more, and they think they are bogged down under some academic situations. And - news out of Kansas City isn't too good, but President Truman is - feeling some irregular heartbeats and has reduced the optimism for his recovery.
Evans: Not too good.
Overmyer: This last one has got to be the height of trivia. I'm just going to read it to you exactly the way it is. It's from Saigon. Question? What does an Air Force enlisted man do when he meets a naked general? He salutes. An order issued by Major Paul M. Boseman at Tan Son N-hut Air Base makes the requirement clear. Salute when you recognize an officer, even though you both are nude. An Air Force spokesman said he didn't know under what circumstances officers and enlisted personnel might encounter - encounter each other in the nude. End of the news for tonight.
Evans: [Laughter] News - a little trivia, isn't it?
Overmyer: Yeah, indeed.
Overmyer: Everybody from the home front sending their love. They are having a little trouble hacking out the - the comm, since we're all on a squawk box together. So they are going to try to get it set up so just the CSM loop will go into your house tomorrow night. Tonight we had all of it, and it was kind of a jumble for them.
Evans: [Laughter] I imagine so, wouldn't it? They can't turn one down - or something, huh?
Overmyer: That's right. Well, they are going to - they are going to try and get it worked on for tomorrow so that only the CSM loop will go in there. They just had to finally give up on it and go watch the - the surface work on television because over where the loop was, it was just too much.
Evans: Yeah, I bet.
Overmyer: When you get into the presleep checklist, you can delete the stir cryos, which is in the checklist. We won't stir the cryos, and then as you get further downstream closer to LOS here - the sleep period, we'll have you turn the H2 Tank 2 Fans to the On position. I'll give you a reminder on that.
Evans: Okay.
122:45:06 Evans: Okay, Houston; America. Bat C is about, oh, 36.8 or 9, something like that [cough].
Overmyer: Say again. Say again...
122:45:16 Evans: Pyro A is 37.
Overmyer: Okay.
122:45:18 Evans: Pyro - okay. Pyro A is 37; Pyro B is 37. Bat C is oh, 36.9. Okay. I think you want the quads now, [garble].
Overmyer: Rog.
122:45:44 Evans: Okay. Alpha is 82. Bravo - a 78. Charlie is 80. Delta is - about 83.
Overmyer: Roger. We got those, and that matches pretty close with what we got right in front of us on those quads. You can go ahead and take the H2 Tanks 2 Fans to On at this time...
Evans: Okay.
122:46:22 Evans: Okay. Tank 2 Fans are going On. H2, that is.

Evans: Okay. You want - minus 74 and 280, huh?
Overmyer: That's affirmative; we just wanted to tweak them up as best we can.
Overmyer: I'll say it again. It's the one in the sleep checklist. You'll get to it at - you get to it down here at about - at about 23:10.

Overmyer: Sounds like some good music in the background there.
Evans: Oh, not too bad really.
123:05:30 Overmyer: Ron, if you're finished there, we would like the - Accept. We got to get on monitor load, and we got a state vector for you tonight.
123:05:42 Evans: Okay. You have Accept.
Overmyer: Roger.
Overmyer: FIDO showed me where those - they're plotting on Doppler what those mascons are doing to you. They really, really have effect.
Evans: Oh, they are, huh?
Overmyer: Yeah, you can really see when you are going right over Imbrium and - Serenitatis.
Evans: [Laughter.]
The Moon's gravitational field was found to be far less uniform than expected. Many of the large maria exhibit a higher gravitational field which is attributed to high density basalt having erupted onto the surface. Spacecraft accelerate slightly as they approach these concentrations of mass (hence 'mascons') and decelerate as they leave. The long-term effect on low orbits around the Moon is to gradually increase an orbit's eccentricity. If uncorrected, the orbit's perilune will eventually intersect the surface.
Overmyer: And just prior to getting into the rest - sleep, we can take Battery B off the charge; terminate the charge.
123:06:36 Evans: Okay. [Long pause.]
123:07:35 Evans: Okay. I checked out the tone booster, and it's hooked up.
Overmyer: Good show.
Comm break.
123:10:34 Evans: Well, I guess I'd better chlorinate the old water.
Long comm break.

123:15:20 Overmyer: Hey, Ron. You can go to Block. The computer's yours.
Evans: Okay. Will do shortly.
Overmyer: Okay. You want me to remind you again while you're - after you're chlorinated here?
Evans: No, I'll get it out.
Overmyer: Okay.
Overmyer: The - the sur - the surface boys are on the way back to the LM, completed their EVA, and they're getting - they're driving back to LM right now.
Evans: Hey, good.
Evans: They got out and did a little riding around on the Rover too, eh?
Overmyer: That's right. It - they - they...
Evans: After the ALSEP was all deployed?
Overmyer: Yes. The ALSEP's deployed. They had to cut their time at Station 1 a little bit. They got to curtail the EVA slightly short of 7 hours due to the high oxygen usage during the - deploying the ALSEP. Only 15 minutes early, so it's no big deal.
Evans: Ah, I see. That's not bad.
Overmyer: No, they're - Gene was working pretty hard putting that drill in the ground, and it was some pretty difficult work. And they - they each fell a couple of times, so they were really pretty busy.
Evans: [Laughter.]

123:19:00 Evans: Are we going to leave tank 3 - I mean, tank 2, H2 Fan, On, all the time?
123:19:05 Overmyer: Rog. H2 tank 2 Fan, On, for all night.
Evans: Okay.
123:19:32 Overmyer: Only thing we've got, Ron, is it looks like you've got to get the Bat B off the Charge and then - configure the comm, and you are all ready to bed down.
Evans: Okay.
123:19:59 Evans: Okay. Battery B relay's breakers In. Charger's Off.
Evans: Okay. I've got to clean the old suit circuit return screen yet.
Evans: Plus-X forward here so - plus 25 and 195. No, wait a minute. Minus l0 and plus 25.
Overmyer: Rog. That - that's affirmative. Minus 10, plus 25. And as tight as you can get it to those numbers, Ron.
Evans: Well, I'll tell you what. I believe the dials more than I believe the set knobs, so - Was that the AOS there? No. Not quite.
123:22:37 Overmyer: Ron, we just been debating here; you need to be sure to do the knobs at the minus 10 and plus 25.
Evans: Okay. I'll put the knobs there.

Evans: [Laughter] It was a good day. Don't worry about that eating. No problem there.
Overmyer: And the bird looks great, and we'll see you when we wake you up. You can sign off any time.

Evans: Putting the shades up...
Evans: Go.
Overmyer: Ah, beautiful.
123:27:57 Overmyer: Ron, just a reminder on the S-Band Normal, Voice, Off, when you're ready to - back out.
Evans: Okay. Let me throw a little buffer solution down in the water here for about 10 minutes, I think.
Overmyer: Rog.
Evans: It takes a little longer to do all this stuff by yourself [laughter].
Overmyer: I'm sure it does.
