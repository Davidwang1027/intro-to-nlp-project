109:54:13 Cernan (onboard): Forward. Command Reset.
109:54:28 Evans (onboard): Simplex. Okay, Challenger; America. I need a [garble]. I'm going to [garble] to you.
Schmitt (onboard): How do you read, Ron?
Evans (onboard): Okay; I got you that time, Jack.
Evans (onboard): You read me okay?
Schmitt (onboard): Yes, you're loud and clear, but turn off your Vox.
Evans (onboard): Okay. I'm [garble] too much, huh?
Schmitt (onboard): That's affirm.
Evans (onboard): I can't read you right now. I just [garble] too much.
109:55:09 Schmitt (onboard): Turn off your Vox.
Evans (onboard): Okay; just a minute. How's that; any better?
Schmitt (onboard): Yes, I think that's pretty good.
Evans (onboard): Okay. Hatch [garble].
Evans (onboard): Okay, Challenger; America. You verify your hatch valves in Auto over there?
109:57:47 Schmitt (onboard): It's verified, Ron.
Evans (onboard): Okay. I'm going to be at the tunnel.
Cernan (onboard): Hey, Ron, what are you using for undocking time now?
Evans (onboard): I've got to look in my book here. It's about 1 - Wait a minute, 1 - 110:27.
Cernan (onboard): Copy. 110:27.
Cernan (onboard): Hello, Ron. I don't - he could use B3 if you need it.
Evans (onboard): Okay. I'll turn it back on here then. Takes a lot longer to depress the tunnel - depress the tunnel - than it does the simulator.
Cernan (onboard): Yes.
Evans (onboard): Okay. You through with the - your rendezvous transponder test?
110:01:06 Cernan (onboard): Yes. Sure am, Ron.
Evans (onboard): Okay. I'm going to Heaters then.
Evans (onboard): Well, then Delta-P is still only 2.5.
110:13:04 Cernan (onboard): Ron, is the tunnel vented yet?
Evans (onboard): Okay. It's down to greater than 3.5.
Cernan (onboard): Well, is that vented? Yes, we're going to press on. That's a big enough Delta-P.
Evans (onboard): Yes, that - that's a big enough Delta-P. I'm going to press on now.
Cernan (onboard): Okay. So are we.
110:13:25 Evans (onboard): Oh, what the heck was that? The O2 Flow just went up for some reason. [Garble] Suit Circuit return or open [garble]. That did it.
Evans (onboard): Good. We can maneuver back to undocklng attitude.
Cernan (onboard): Okay, Ron.
110:17:59 Evans (onboard): You got about l0 minutes to go.
Cernan (onboard): You said about 10 minutes, didn't you, Ron?
Evans (onboard): Yes, that's right.
110:18:15 Cernan (onboard): Okay.
110:18:XX : BEGIN LUNAR REV 12
110:21:54 Evans (onboard): Okay. It's a flight trim for P41.
Cernan (onboard): Okay, Ron. We're at 5 minutes now and counting. How'd that sound?
Evans (onboard): Yes, I got 6.
Cernan (onboard): On your time. Better check your undocking time. Are you using 110:20...
Evans (onboard): I'm using 110:27:55.
Cernan (onboard): :55?
Evans (onboard): 110:27:55.00.
Cernan (onboard): Five minutes then, will you?
110:22:59 Evans (onboard): Okay. Stand by. Twenty - something seconds yet. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
Evans (onboard): Mark it. Five minutes.
Cernan (onboard): Okay. We're counting with you, and your attitude looks good here.
Evans (onboard): Okay.
Cernan (onboard): Ron, when you get all squared away...
Evans (onboard): You need a 06 20?
Cernan (onboard): Yes, on my mark.
Evans (onboard): Okay. Go ahead.
Cernan (onboard): 1...
110:24:34 Cernan (onboard): Mark it.
Evans (onboard): Okay. 000.35, 104.67, 000.52.
Cernan (onboard): [Garble] hear what you're saying.
Evans (onboard): Say again?
Cernan (onboard): We copy it; slower.
Evans (onboard): Okay. R-1, 000.35; R-2, 104.67; R-3, 000.52. How's that?
Cernan (onboard): Okay, Ron. It puts us inside 2 minutes and we're ready.
Evans (onboard): Okay. We're all set over here.
Schmitt (onboard): Okay, Ron. Remember, as soon as it's convenient, you'll start your maneuver to Sep attitude.
Evans (onboard): Okay. Will do. Delta-V, Normal, and start the old DAC. Darn thing doesn't work.
Cernan (onboard): Better work. Get some pictures of us.
Evans (onboard): Son-of-a-gun! Sorry about that. Okay. At 59:30, I'm going to hang you on the probe. No picture. Okay. You should be hanging on the probe. You are. Okay. At 00 - at 00, we'll back off.
Cernan (onboard): Sure wish you'd got some pics.
Evans (onboard): Yes, I don't know why in heck it doesn't work, but it sure doesn't.
Evans (onboard): Okay. Here we go.
110:28:10 Cernan (onboard): You're backing off; we're free.
Evans (onboard): Okay. I got some pics of you.
Cernan (onboard): You look beautiful, Ron.
Evans (onboard): Ah-ha, so do you!
Cernan (onboard): Are you beautiful!
Evans (onboard): That thing is pretty out there, you know that.
Cernan (onboard): 70-millimeters, Ron.
Evans (onboard): Okay. That's what I got. I've also got some 16-millimeter at you.
110:31:10 Evans (onboard): Okay. I'm maneuvering now.
Cernan (onboard): Landing gear?
Evans (onboard): They look great! One of them doesn't have a probe on it, but I guess it's supposed to be that way, huh? The one in the front. Beautiful! Sun's shining right in my window. That's the last picture I'm going to get of you.
Cernan (onboard): The ship looks clean.
Evans (onboard): Very good. Okay. I lost you right in the Sun for me, so you should be getting some good pictures of me.
Cernan (onboard): We're working at it, partner.
Evans (onboard): Okay.
Cernan (onboard): America, you look beautiful.
Evans (onboard): Man, oh, man, I - ought to see those - All I had to do was plug in the camera and that made it work.
Evans (onboard): Hey, there you are out the hatch window,
Schmitt (onboard): Okay, Ron. You're off candid camera.
Evans (onboard): Okay. Good - good show. You guys make your darn landing now, okay?
Cernan (onboard): Okay. Until we see you in a couple days.
Evans (onboard): Okay.
Schmitt (onboard): No TEI updates.
Cernan (onboard): [Laughter] Don't worry, never happen. Hey, Jack. Remember, part in 175, is that it?
Cernan (onboard): 109, Ron. That's what you are, babe.
110:35:40 Evans (onboard): [Laughter]

110:39:18 - This is Apollo Control; 110 hours, 39 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17. Less than 2 minutes remaining now until America and Challenger, separated and flying a few feet apart at this time, will come around the front side of the Moon on the twelfth lunar orbit.
Slightly over a minute now until we should start attempting to lock up on the downlink signal from America and Challenger. The two-way communications from spacecraft communicator for the Command Service Module, Ken Mattingly, and Ron Evans aboard America will be on a separate loop as it was the last revolution. These conversations can be heard in room 161 in the Houston News Center. Early in this revolution we'll have the pressurization of the Descent Propulsion System and checkout of that system. Some 6 - 5 seconds away from acquisition. We'll stand by until Network advises the Flight Director that they do have firm lock-on. We have AOS in Lunar Module, let's see what we hear.
110:41:34 Cernan: Hello, Houston. [Garble] Challenger [garble]? Hello, Houston. [Garble] Challenger [garble]? [Pause.]
110:41:58 Fullerton: Hello, Challenger; Houston. You're very, very weak. Over.
110:42:04 Cernan: Okay, Houston. Challenger [garble] checkout is complete [garble] and we're looking at America, the beautiful.
110:42:17 Fullerton: Okay, Geno, I understand you're undocked. But we're not reading, but about 10 percent of what you're saying. Standby [garble]. [Long pause.]
110:42:49 Mattingly: America, Houston; standing by.
110:42:55 Evans: Okay, Houston. This is America. We're floating free out here. The Challenger looks real pretty. The residuals on the P41 were plus 1.9, minus 0.2, and 0. Undock and sep was on time.
110:43:17 Mattingly: Sounds good.
110:43:19 Schmitt: Houston, this is Challenger. Won't hold on the steerable antenna yet. It looks like I'm getting oscillations in my uplink signal strength, and then it gradually drops off to zero.
110:43:35 Fullerton: Okay, Jack. We're reading you better now. Understand.
110:43:44 Cernan: Okay, Gordo. If you're reading, you got the words. We are undocked. Landing radar self test was Go. We're ready to press on to the DPS throttle check, and we've been looking at America, the beautiful. It's rare form.
110:44:00 Fullerton: Okay, Geno. We've got that. It sounds good.
110:44:05 Cernan: Okay, and the residuals on P47 at undocking were 0, minus 0.1, and 0.
110:44:14 Fullerton: Okay. We copy that. We'd like you to try the steerable again. [Long pause.]
110:44:35 Schmitt: Okay, Houston; we've got it.
110:44:38 Fullerton: Okay. You sound real good; loud and clear.
110:44:42 Schmitt: Okay, let me give you some Noun 20 angles, if you want them.
Noun 20 from the computer yields the gimbal angles from the IMU. They therefore represent the spacecraft's attitude with respect to whatever REFSMMAT the IMU platform is aligned to.
110:44:45 Fullerton: Go ahead. Ready to copy.
110:44:49 Schmitt: The LM: plus 301.09, plus 284.53, plus 359.48; the CSM: plus three zeros .35, plus 104.67, plus 000.52; the time: 110:24:00. Over.
110:45:20 Fullerton: Okay, Jack. We got that.
110:45:25 Cernan: Okay, Gordo; we're ready. DPS throttle check. I'm ready to hit Engine Stop.
110:45:30 Fullerton: Stand by. Okay; we're ready. [Pause.]
110:45:39 Cernan: Okay. And the light is on. [Pause.] The Reg light is On.
110:45:51 Fullerton: Roger. [Pause. ]We're showing the Engine Arm circuit breaker may be out. Would you check that? [Long pause.]
110:46:17 Schmitt: Okay. I'm sorry, Gordy. A little - We missed that here. Okay, we'll try it again. [Pause.]
110:46:30 Mattingly: America, Houston. When you have an opportunity, how about cycling the High Gain to Wide and back to Reacq? [Pause.]
110:46:44 Evans: Okay, Can do.
110:46:46 Mattingly: Thank you, sir. [Long pause.]
110:47:16 Mattingly: Okay, America. How about going back to Narrow on the antenna. And could you verify what you loaded on Noun 34? It went by so fast on the downlink, we didn't get it a chance to look at it.
110:47:21 Cernan: Gordy, if the throttle test looked okay, I'll go Engine Arm Off.
110:47:26 Fullerton: Okay. It looked real good. Go ahead. [Long pause.]
ALSJ - Cernan and Schmitt pressurized the propellant tanks and, a few minutes later, made their last pass over Taurus-Littrow prior to the descent. Evans had not yet made his circularization burn and was ahead and slightly below them. It was a spectacular, oblique view of the valley. They were less than fifteen miles away, and the LM crew took a couple of color pictures. Cernan was particularly interested in the small group of craters that surrounded his target point, and he called out the names as he found them.
110:47:43 Evans: There, you got it? [Pause.]
110:47:52 Mattingly: Okay. That looks good.
110:47:53 Evans: Does that look okay?
110:47:54 Mattingly: Yes, sir. Sure does.
110:47:58 Evans: Okay. No update then, huh?
110:48:00 Mattingly: That's correct.
110:48:04 Evans: Okay.
Comm break.

AS17-147-22454 - CSM viewed from LM, west of Becvar - JSC scan
110:49:25 Fullerton: Roger.
110:49:28 Cernan: I got two good lights.
110:49:30 Fullerton: Two lights. [Pause.]
AS17-147-22455 - CSM viewed from LM, west of Becvar - JSC scan
110:49:36 Cernan: Okay; on my mark. Descent Prop Isol Valve. 3, 2, 1...
110:49:40 Cernan: Mark it. We heard it.
110:49:44 Fullerton: Roger. [Pause.]
110:49:51 Fullerton: Okay; looks good.
110:49:52 Schmitt: Gordy, there was a slight upward - Gordy, there was an upward fluctuation in pressure in the manifold when we fired that. It's back to where it was, prefiring.
AS17-147-22456 - CSM viewed from LM, west of Becvar - JSC scan
110:50:05 Fullerton: Okay. That's what it should have done, Jack. [Long pause.]
110:50:24 Cernan: Okay, Helium Press, Descent Start. 3, 2, 1...
110:50:29 Cernan: Mark it. We got it. [Long pause.]
110:50:43 Cernan: Okay; looks good onboard. About 240 both sides.
110:50:49 Fullerton: Okay; looks good on the ground. [Pause.]
110:50:59 Cernan: Say, Gordy, this thing sounds a little bit like my stomach sounded a couple of days ago.
AS17-147-22457 - CSM viewed from LM, north wall of Abul Wfa - JSC scan
110:51:06 Fullerton: Roger that. [Long pause.]
110:51:24 Schmitt: AGS coming on to Standby. [Long pause.]
AS17-147-22458 - CSM viewed from LM, northwest wall of Abul Wfa - JSC scan
110:51:42 Schmitt: Okay. Master Alarm and AGS light. [Long pause.]
AS17-147-22459 - CSM viewed from LM, southeast of Firsov - JSC scan
110:52:06 Schmitt: Okay, 10 [garble] 110:52:00 for the time on the AGS.
110:52:14 Fullerton: Roger, Jack. [Long pause.]
AS17-147-22460 - CSM viewed from LM, Firsov south wall - JSC scan
110:52:47 Fullerton: Geno, we show Jack's Suit Isol valve in Suit Disconnect. Should be in Suit Flow. Would you check that for - for us, please?
110:52:58 Cernan: Yeah. He's in Suit Flow now.
110:53:01 Fullerton: Okay. Thank you.
AS17-147-22461 - CSM viewed from LM, west of Firsov - JSC scan
110:53:04 Cernan: I'll tell you - I'll tell you, this LCG sure makes a world of difference up here.
110:53:10 Fullerton: Roger. [Pause.]
110:53:19 Cernan: Hey, America; Challenger. [Pause.]
AS17-147-22462 - CSM viewed from LM, west of Firsov - JSC scan
110:53:31 Cernan: Hey, Ron; listen. This ridge you're coming on over - just stick your hand out the hatch and grab a rock.
110:53:35 Evans: Looks like it's pretty low down there.
110:53:39 Cernan: Well, when you're up here looking at where you are, it even looks lower.
110:53:43 Evans: [Laughter] I'll bet.
Long comm break.

110:56:52 Fullerton: Challenger; Houston. I have a new AGS K factor for you.
110:56:58 Schmitt: Stand by a second. [Long pause.]
110:57:42 Schmitt: Go with the K factor.
110:57:44 Fullerton: Okay; it's 109:59:59.94. Over. [Pause.]
110:57:59 Schmitt: 109:59:59.94.
110:58:04 Fullerton: That's right.
110:58:06 Cernan: Gordo, this is spectacular. It is absolutely spectacular looking at that Command Module America down there coming across the surface. We're just tracking him at about a 30-degree dive angle.
110:58:20 Fullerton: Sounds great. [Pause.]
110:58:30 Cernan: Okay, babe; have a good time, and go get that landmark. Don't forget - No TEIs. See you in about 3 days.
TEI or Trans-Earth Injection would mean that Ron is heading for home. Gene and Jack would rather he didn't do so until they return from the surface in three days. [Long pause.]
AS17-147-22463 - CSM viewed from LM, Peirce C - JSC scan
110:59:27 Fullerton: Geno, Houston, with a couple of items. [Pause.]
110:59:34 Schmitt: Go ahead, Gordo.
110:59:36 Fullerton: Okay. Your perilune seems to be...
110:59:38 Cernan: Hey, we got the landing site, Gordo.
110:59:42 Fullerton: Okay. I'll hold...
110:59:42 Cernan: Gordo, we got the landing site. We're coming right over the front of it. Stand by a minute. You can see the Slide. I think you can see the Great Cross.
110:59:54 Fullerton: Roger.
110:59:57 Cernan: We'll get a picture of America coming right across it.
111:00:00 Fullerton: All righty.
AS17-147-22464 - Gene took this photo on the orbit before final descent. On the final approach, Gene flew Challenger down over the Sculptured Hills (low, knobby hills in sunlight just right of frame center) and out over the valley floor before landing a little north of the Trident group of craters. The CSM with Ron Evans can be seen in the left distance with the South Massif in the background. Henry is the furthermost of the three largish craters at the foot of the North Massif to the right - JSC scan
111:00:04 Schmitt: Super targeting.
AS17-147-22465 - Gene took this photo on the orbit before final descent. On the final approach, Gene flew Challenger down over the Sculptured Hills (low, knobby hills in sunlight just right of frame center) and out over the valley floor before landing a little north of the Trident group of craters. The CSM with Ron Evans can be seen in the left distance with the South Massif in the background. Henry is the furthermost of the three largish craters at the foot of the North Massif to the right - JSC scan
111:00:06 Cernan: Gosh, we've got Family Mountain; we've got - of course - the Massif; we can see the Scarp; we can see the light mantle; I've got the Great Cross, Camelot, Sherlock.
AS17-147-22466 - CSM, Apollo 17 Landing site - JSC scan
111:00:19 Schmitt: Believe it or not, Houston, they're all there.
AS17-147-22467 - CSM, Apollo 17 Landing site - JSC scan
111:00:23 Fullerton: How about that.
111:00:24 Schmitt: I see possible structure - possible structure in the upper part of the South Massif, little bit east of Station 2. It's subhorizontal, dipping to the southeast.
111:00:40 Cernan: Houston, I can even see Poppy, right where we're going to set this baby down.
111:00:45 Fullerton: Very good.
111:00:47 Cernan: As a matter of fact, I can see Rudolph. I can even see the triangle: Rudolph, Frosty, and Punk. [Pause.] Man, Gordo, this is absolutely spectacular.
AS17-147-22468 - Distant view of CSM viewed from LM - JSC scan
AS17-147-22468 - Cropped versions of the distant view of the CSM as viewed from LM. Low resolution and high resolution versions compared - JSC and ASU scans
111:01:09 Fullerton: Sure sounds like it.
111:01:11 Cernan: We can watch Ron track - we can watch Ron track right on through the landmarks. I don't know what kind of results he got, but he sure had a nice smooth track from here.
111:01:25 Fullerton: Roger. [Long pause.]
111:01:37 Schmitt: Gordo, you can go ahead and update us with those words.
111:01:40 Fullerton: Okay. Your perilune is shifting west. PDI will be a little higher than nominal: 10.7 miles or 65,000 feet [19.8 km]; should be no problem. And, from the time you first came around until we had a solid lockup on the steerable on this acquisition was about 3 minutes. We're going to try to speed that up some on the next time around. We'd like you to just keep trying the steerable until we come to you - and say, "stop trying." Over.
111:02:13 Schmitt: Okay, Gordy, understand that; and apparently this time, had I let it - had I waited a little longer, it would have dropped to zero and then come up, because that's what happened when I finally got you. I'll give it more time next time.
111:02:28 Fullerton: Okay. [Pause.]
111:02:38 Fullerton: And, Jack, I've got lots of PADs for you whenever you're ready. [Long pause.]
111:03:37 Schmitt: Okay, Gordy; go with the PADs.
111:03:39 Fullerton: Okay. The first one is a P76 with a CSM circ. [Pause.]
111:03:49 Schmitt: Go.
111:03:51 Fullerton: Okay. Noun 33 is 111:57:30.09; Noun 84: plus 0070.5, plus five zeros, and minus 0000.5. Go ahead. [Pause.]
111:04:26 Schmitt: Okay. 111:57:30.09; plus 0070.5, plus all zeros, minus four zeros 5.
111:04:37 Fullerton: Okay. Good readback. Next one I have is the No-PDI plus 12 abort, item Echo.
111:04:46 Schmitt: Go ahead.
111:04:47 Fullerton: Okay. Echo is 113:02:00.00; Foxtrot, plus 0103.4, plus five zeros, minus 0050.0; Noun 42: 0142.0, plus 0005.4, 0114.9; burn time is 0:48; 000, 272; 373...
111:05:43 Cernan: [Speaking to Ron] Okay. Just a second. Give me a transponder, and we'll start with the radar. Jack's tied up right now.
111:05:50 Fullerton: 373 is 0182.0; AGS Delta-Vs: plus 0103.7, plus five zeros, minus 0049.3; Golf, 113:57:00.00; Hotel, 11 - I'll start over - 115:36:45.00; and the No-DOI-2 Delta-VX, 0096.6. Two remarks: throttle profile is 10 percent for 26 seconds, 40 percent for the rest of the burn. Over. [Long pause.]
111:07:14 Schmitt: Okay, readback. 11 - No-PDI plus 12 - 113:02 all zeros; plus 0103.4, plus all zeros, minus 0050.0; 0142.0, plus three zeros 5.4, 0114.9; 0:48; all zeros, 272; 0182.0; plus 0103.7, plus all zeros, minus 0049.3; 113:57 all zeros; 115:36:45.00; 0096.6; remarks: throttle profile 10 percent for 26 seconds; 40 percent for the remainder.
111:08:06 Fullerton: Okay, that's a good readback. Item India: 112:49:52.35...
111:08:19 Cernan: Say, Gordo.
111:08:20 Fullerton: Go ahead.
111:08:21 Cernan: Gordo, Gordo. Hey, Gordo; stand by. We want to finish the radar VHF test; and when I go to P52, you can finish the PADs.
111:08:29 Fullerton: Okay. [Long pause.]
111:08:45 Cernan: Okay. We're in VHF Ranging, and I've got you on radar, Ron. We'll be quiet for a second and see if you can get a lockon. [Long pause.]
111:09:07 Evans: Ah-ha! it works! Point - 0.50 miles.
111:09:09 Cernan: Okay. [Pause.]
111:09:16 Evans: Okay, 0.50 or 0.49 miles. [Long pause.]
111:09:34 Cernan: Okay, Gordo. The VHF ranging and radar checks out very well.

111:48:04 - This is Apollo Control. We've had Loss of Signal as America and Challenger, coasting along nearby each other, passed behind the Moon on revolution number 12. Some 47 minutes until they come back around again on the 13th lunar revolution. Behind the Moon this time, the Command Service Module, piloted by Ron Evans, will do the CSM circularization maneuver which will place the spacecraft back up into an almost circular lunar orbit, measuring 69.7 by 54.5 [nautical miles, 129.1 by 100.1 km], those are the targeted measurements of that orbit. Ignition time, again which will be behind the Moon and out of contact, is Ground Elapsed Time of 111:57:28. The Lunar Module DOI, or Descent Orbit Insertion burn number 2 also will be behind the Moon before we reacquire the spacecraft. That is scheduled for 112 hours, 2 minutes, 40 seconds. It's a fairly small burn of 7.6 feet per second, which will lower the pericynthion of Challenger down to 6½ miles - nautical miles [12.0 km] with apocynthion staying at 61.5 nautical miles [113.9 km]. During the next front side pass, comes the moment of truth with powered descent, and touchdown at Taurus-Littrow landing site as Challenger lights off the big descent engine at 112 hours, 49 minutes, 52 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. The ignition countdown clock in the control center is counting down to PDI, some 59 minutes, 17 - 16 seconds until ignition with landing shortly under 12 minutes later, depending on the amount of hover time available. The broadcast line will be brought up again just prior to Acquisition of Signal as America and Challenger come around on the front side again on revolution 13. And at 111 hours, 51 minutes; this is Apollo Control.
111:48:00 Cernan (onboard-LM): Ron, do you still read us?

112:33:34 - This is Apollo Control at 112 hours, 33 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 17. Coming up on Acquisition of Signal of both spacecraft, America and Challenger, coming from behind the Moon on the 13th lunar orbit. Some 1 minute, 32 seconds away from acquisition of the Command Module and slightly under three minutes on the Lunar Module, Challenger. Challenger, during this revolution will descend to the surface of the Moon and land at the Taurus-Littrow landing site. Ignition time currently is Ground Elapsed Time of 112 hours, 49 minutes, 52 seconds. During the descent to the surface the spacecraft onboard computer will be generating numbers on the display which the Lunar Module Pilot will call out to the commander and which - angles at which the commander should be able to see the landing site through a grid etched on the left hand window of the Lunar Module. Here, we have AOS. AOS of the Command Service Module and the circulars - the circularization burn was good. This is Apollo Control on the air-ground 2 circuit. Command Module Pilot Ron Evans is giving the CapCom all of the residuals. Here comes Challenger. Back to the lunar landing sequence as the Lunar Module Pilot reads out the angles that the Commander ought to be able to see the landing site. The Commander is able to run through an operation called redesignation by using a pitch hand controller to rotate the spacecraft.
112:36:XX Schmitt: Hello, Houston. How do you read Challenger?
112:36:XX Fullerton: Challenger, you're loud and clear.
112:36:XX Schmitt: Hello, Houston. How do you read Challenger on an Omni right now?
ALSJ - At AOS on the 13th orbit, Evans reappeared first and confirmed that the LM burn had gone well. And then, once Houston had a bit more tracking data with which to update the LM computer, everything was ready for the landing.
112:37:03 Fullerton: Okay, Challenger, you're loud and clear on the Omni. How did it go?
112:37:12 Schmitt: Okay, The burn was Go. We're in a 7-mile perigee on the PGNS, and we had 0, plus 0.1 and plus 0.1 residuals.
112:37:21 Fullerton: Okay, sounds good.
112:37:25 Schmitt: Ok - Okay, Gordy, I'm going to try the high gain I had you locked up once, and then I lost you. Let me try it again.
112:37:32 Fullerton: We concur. Go ahead, Jack. [Long pause.]
112:38:01 Schmitt: Okay, Gordy, that's my fault. I didn't know you were uplinking. You've got the Omni, and I'll leave it.
112:38:07 Fullerton: Okay, we'll stay on the Omni for the uplink. [Long pause.]
112:38:52 Schmitt: Okay, Gordy, ED Bats are 37.2, both batteries. The ascent battery On time was 112:19:00, about 4 minutes late.
