Apollo 15 landing from PDI to Touchdown
An annotated portrayal of the Apollo 15 landing on the Moon with captions to explain the various stages of the descent. This is part of the Apollo Flight Journal, Apollo 15 collection.
Apollo 15 Onboard 16-mm film footage
Apollo 15 - 16-mm magazine 1228-A
00:26 View from Command Module as it approaches the Lunar Module 'Falcon' mounted at the top of the Saturn S-IVB stage. 01:49 Soft dock is achieved when three capture latches in the probe's tip engage around the lip of a hole in the LM's drogue. 02:12 Retraction of the docking probe begins to bring the two spacecraft together. 02:19 After some rotation occurs between the LM and CSM, a hard dock is achieved by the operation of 12 automatic docking latches. This video is presented at 24 frames per second, regardless of the original shooting speed.
H.264 MP4 video file.
Apollo 15 - 16-mm magazine 1240-AA
00:14 Command Module 'Endeavour' as seen from Lunar Module 'Falcon'. At the start of the shots, the CM is over 25.4N, 19W; west of Crater Bessel H. 01:02 The CM passes by the Hadley landing site. 01:12 Lunar surface on the approach to the landing site, which is at 01:14. 01:20 Falcon's descent and landing from the approach phase onwards, shot at 12 frames per second. 02:4602:46 Touchdown on the surface. 03:18 Spacecraft interior with David Scott and Jim Irwin tumbling 16mm film cassettes in the CM cabin. This video is presented at 24 frames per second, regardless of the original shooting speed.

Undocking of Lunar Module from Command Service Module. 00:23 Docking target viewed from CM window. 00:51 Shot change but same view of docking target. 01:08 Moment of undocking by the technique of probe extension. 01:14 LM is released from the capture latches. 01:56 LM commences yaw rotation. 02:20 LM commences pitch up to face CM. This video is presented at 24 frames per second, regardless of the original shooting speed.

Apollo 15 - 16-mm magazine 1241-BB
Launch and ascent of the ascent stage of Lunar Module 'Falcon'. 00:20 View from LMP's window showing landing site. 00:29 Lift-off from the Hadley landing site. Note large piece of Mylar or Kapton coasting over the ALSEP science experiments package. The wobble in the LM's flight is due to a slight offset of the stage's centre of mass from the engine's thrust axis. This causes a slight rotation which is corrected every two seconds by the computer firing the RCS thrusters as it goes through is 2-second cycle of tasks. 00:56 View of Hadley Rille. 03:07 Crater Spurr. 03:34 South Rim of crater Archimedes at left of frame. 03:57 Crater Bancroft. 04:05 Orbital insertion. This footage was shot at 12 frames per seconds but is presented here at 24 frames per second. Therefore all motion is at twice normal speed.

Apollo 15 - 16-mm magazine 1230-C
The approach and docking of the ascent stage of Lunar Module 'Falcon' with Command Service Module 'Endeavour'. 00:23 LM passes through frame as it approaches. 00:48 LM re-enters frame. 01:08 LM begins station-keeping. 01:45 New shot. LM in sunlight with lunar horizon at bottom of frame. 01:58 LM begins pitch manoeuvre to present docking port to CSM. It then leaves frame. 02:18 LM re-enters frame as it yaws into correct attitude for docking. CSM then begins approach to dock. 03:49 Soft dock as probe capture latches engage on LM drogue. 03:58 probe retraction and hard dock. This video is presented at 24 frames per second, regardless of the original shooting speed.

Apollo 15 - 16-mm magazine 1246-EE
00:10 View from stationary Lunar Rover with TV camera in foreground. Shot by Jim Irwin. 00:15 View from moving Rover. Very unstable at first. 00:54 Rover comes to a halt. 01:54 Commander David Scott working at the Rover. 02:07 View from moving Rover. Shot begins with David Scott ('CDR' on Hasselblad camera). It then turns to the front looking past the TV camera. 02:58 Rover begins to follow its own outbound tracks. 03:08 Rover turns to the direction of Mount Hadley, a 15,000-foot mountain at the north end of the embayment. All shot at 24 frames per second.

00:19 Reproduction of a still frame from 16-mm shot of Al Worden carrying out an EVA between Moon and Earth to retrieve film cassettes from the side of the Apollo 15 Service Module. The single frame in the original shot was caused by the film magazine jamming.
