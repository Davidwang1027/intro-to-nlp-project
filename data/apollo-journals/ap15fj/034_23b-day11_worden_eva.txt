This chapter continues coverage of day 11 of the flight of Apollo 15. The date is 5 August 1971. The primary event coming up is for Al Worden to go outside the spacecraft and manoeuvre himself to the SIM bay where he will retrieve large film canisters that contain photographic coverage gained by the Mapping and Panoramic cameras. Jim Irwin will assist Al by standing up in the hatch.

This is Apollo Control; 239 hours, 19 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Handover under way here in the control center as Gerry Griffin's Gold Team takes over from the outgoing shift headed up by Milt Windler of the Maroon Team. There will not be a change of shift press conference [at the] end of this shift. Apollo 15 now 175,871 nautical miles [325,712 km] out from Earth, approaching at a velocity of 2,885 feet per second [879 m/s]. Splashtime: 55 hours, 51 minutes away. Next major item of the morning will be the Command Module Pilot's EVA to retrieve film packages from the SIM bay. This will take place at 10:24 Central Daylight Time or 241 hours, 50 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, that is the cabin depress - the actual EVA will follow some 20 or 30 minutes after. At 239 hours, 20 minutes, up live on air/ground with Apollo 15, this is Apollo Control.
The procedures for the EVA begin on page 3-1 of the CSM Systems Checklist.

239:50:45 Henize: Apollo 15, this is Houston. [No answer.]
Comm break.
239:51:47 Henize: 15, this is Houston, broadcasting in the blind, with a request that, if possible, we bring back Dave's LCG. If it's already stowed in too inaccessible a place in the - in the jettison bag, don't bother. But if you can possibly save it, please bring it back.
Mission Control's request refers to the LCG (Liquid Cooled Garment) that Dave was wearing three days ago when he and Jim Irwin returned from the Moon's surface. After re-entering the Command Module and while preparing to jettison the Lunar Module Falcon, he had trouble sealing the water connection to the LCG and had to use a plug instead. If returned to Earth, then analysis of the problem, believed to be caused by dust contamination, can be made in time for the next flight.
239:52:08 Scott: Okay. Sorry, Houston, we were getting suited there, and didn't realize we were off comm; but copied your request. Let us think about it for a minute.
239:52:19 Henize: Roger. [Long pause.]
239:52:45 Scott: Well, Houston, I guess that it's a good reason we're about an hour ahead. So we'll go ahead and dig it out. [Pause.]
239:52:58 Henize: That's your choice, Dave.
239:53:04 Scott: Well, we're sort of ahead, expecting little things like that to pop up.
239:53:08 Henize: Fine.
Comm break.
Woods, from 2004 mission review: "Suited and unsuited in the Command Module in weightlessness. Is that a particularly difficult task. Is it easier or more difficult than doing so on the Moon. You got three guys in a small space and no gravity."
Scott, from 2004 mission review: "The only added difficulty in weightlessness is sort of getting to a position where the other guy can help you get in the suit and hold the suit. That's no big deal. The work on the suit is getting it zipped, getting it plugged, getting it checked. All that stuff. Yeah it was probably a little more difficult than... [laughs] They're both hard. If I say weightlessness is more difficult than one-sixth-g then the implication is that one-sixth-g is easy. Not easy. Very, very hard."
239:54:11 Scott: Say, Houston, by the way, the LCG you'll get back is the one I wore on the third EVA only. [Long pause.]
239:54:30 Henize: Roger; Dave. That's fine. That's the one we'd like.
239:54:35 Scott: Okay. Okay. [Long pause.]
239:54:56 Henize: And 15, whenever Al has a quiet moment, I have several prebriefing questions to send up to him about what to look for on the V over H sensor.
The V over H sensor is part of the Panoramic Camera's system. The sensor optically determines the rate at which the landscape is passing below, allowing the camera to adjust for the smearing that would occur if uncorrected.
239:55:08 Scott: Okay, give us about an hour for that, then we'll be able to talk to you.
239:55:12 Henize: Very good.
Long comm break.

This is Apollo Control at 239 hours, 58 minutes. Apollo 15 now 174,778 nautical miles [323,688 km] from Earth. Velocity, 2,909 feet per second [887 m/s]. And the crew is in preparations for the EVA to retrieve the film cassettes from the Panoramic and Mapping Cameras.

240:01:48 Henize: 15, this is Houston. We'd like to have Manual [pointing] on the High Gain whenever one of you has a chance to get there. No need to answer.
Endeavour has probably been manoeuvred to the required attitude for Al's EVA. Appropriate angles are given in the Flight Plan for aiming the HGA (High Gain Antenna). To use them, the crew assume manual control of the antenna's mounting gimbal and dial in the given angles using two knobs to the lower right of the Main Display Console, panel 2. Nearby gauges let them monitor the antenna's actual orientation.
Now that the spacecraft is in the proper attitude, the A and B thruster quads are disabled. These are adjacent to the SIM bay and would pose a danger to Al as the spacecraft constantly fires thrusters to maintain its attitude. Guard rails are installed over the centre of the Main Display Console to ensure that controls, particularly those concerning the RCS, are not nudged. The three crew don their suits, Dave and Jim wearing their surface EVA suits, and get connected to the spacecraft's suit oxygen circuit. Al's 7.4-metre umbilical is different in that it includes a tether connected between a fixing on the CM and a waist belt he will wear around the outside of his suit. The umbilical also carries wiring for communication and biomedical telemetry. Jim also has a waist belt and a shorter, 2.2-metre tether as he will stand in the CM hatch during the EVA, helping control Al's umbilical, operate the TV and 16-mm cameras and bring the film cassettes into the cabin.
240:01:58 Worden: Let me do it.
240:01:59 Scott: Okay. Going Manual.
Very long comm break.

This is Apollo Control at 240 hours, 06 minutes. Dave Scott reported a short time ago that the crew was about 1 hour ahead on the time line. We do not anticipate however that the EVA will start 1 hour early. We're staying keyed here to the normal Flight Plan time for EVA. If that changes we'll let you know but at the present time, we do not anticipate moving the Flight Plan ahead. The liquid cooled garment that they have asked them to bring back is the one in which Dave Scott replaced a plug when they failed a suit integrity check about LM jettison time in lunar orbit. The experts on the ground would like to take a look at that garment.
During this hour of communications silence, the crew continue their preparations for the EVA.
Scott, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "On the night after TEI, Al started configuring the cabin, stowage-wise, so that we'd be set up for the EVA. I think he put at least 2 hours into configuring the cabin the night before."
Worden, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "Yes. There was a lot of detail stuff, like putting things into the EVA bag, getting the purge valve out, and getting a lot of the little stuff out of the stowage containers. We tied the rock bags up to the sides of the spacecraft, rather than tying them down on top of the lockers. That way we could get in and out. Rearranging the stowage was kind of the detail part of some of the EVA prep that we did the night before."
Scott, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "The point is that when we got into the EVA day - when we got up that morning for the EVA - the cabin was already in good shape. Everything was set up so that we could proceed into the EVA prep according to the checklist with a minimum amount of shuffling. At the outset, I'd like to say that the checklist was excellent. The procedures ran very smoothly. I don't think anything was out of order. We had a very complete set of procedures overall. Everything got done according to the book, and it was very good. The only problem was time. We got up that morning and we had a few SIM bay things to do. Al had some P23s to do, and as soon as he finished his P23s, we started into the checklist and the portion called "Cabin Prep for EVA." We started that at 237:30 GET. It's really called in the Flight Plan to start at 239:30, so we started 2 hours early in the cabin prep for EVA. We went through every step line-by-line to make sure it all got done. It flowed very smoothly with no hitches, and it just took a little time to get everything done. We ended up just about on time for the pressure integrity checks. That means that it took us almost 2 hours longer than preflight planning. We were very happy that we had started early. We were glad that we had Al configure the cabin the night before to take care of the little details. I think it will pay off if you get started early on the EVA, because it really takes a lot of time making sure that you get everything done."
Worden, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "Most things you do on board take a little longer than you would expect them to preflight. That's because you take a little bit more care with what you're doing in flight. You do it much more methodically than you do preflight. That was particularly true of the EVA prep. We went through the checklist very carefully, very methodically, and we never rushed at any time. It flowed very smoothly but a little slower than we anticipated."
Scott, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "Which I think was good in that case, because it was the first time through for that EVA. It was nice to have a comfortable time pad all the way through. We knew we had a good time pad all the way through, so perhaps we were not operating at maximum efficiency relative to time. We were taking our time because we knew we had the pad."
So that Mission Control, and the public too, can watch the progress of Al's excursion along the Service Module, a pole has been provided so that the colour TV camera and the 16-mm movie camera can be mounted far enough from the CM main hatch to gain a reasonable view of his activities around the SIM bay. The pole will be attached to the inside of the open hatch.
When Dave and Jim walked and drove on the Moon, they each carried a backpack called a PLSS (Portable Life Support System) which provided all the required consumables to keep them alive and fit for over seven hours. The PLSS provided oxygen, cooling water and it scrubbed CO2 out of the air. If, however, a suit were to be punctured for some reason, the flow-rate from the oxygen supply would likely not be high enough to sustain the crewman against the falling pressure. For this contingency, both Dave and Jim carried an extra package on top of the PLSS called the OPS (Oxygen Purge System), the prime component of which was a very high pressure bottle of O2 which could be quickly released through a regulator. Though the PLSS's were discarded on the Moon, the two OPS units were retained in case Dave and Jim needed to transfer to the CM by an EVA. Now one unit will provide Al with his emergency supply during his EVA.

240:59:59 Scott: Okay, Houston. Apollo 15.
241:00:04 Henize: 15, this is Houston. Go ahead. [Pause.]
241:00:11 Scott: We're all suited up, and down to the comm check portion of the EVA prep, and we're ready to talk to you about whatever you'd like to talk about.
241:00:21 Henize: Roger. Stand by. [Long pause.]
241:00:34 Henize: I guess the main thing we have to talk about is the inspection of the V over H sensor of the Pan Camera. Are you ready to listen, Al? [Pause.]
241:00:48 Scott: Okay. He can read you, but he's got to reconfigure his panel in order to talk to you, so we'll do that.
241:00:56 Worden: Okay, Karl, how do you read me now?
241:00:57 Henize: Loud and clear, Al. Hey, on this V over H sensor, I have a set of five steps, or five questions that we'd like to have for you to have in your mind.
241:01:09 Worden: Okay. Go ahead.
241:01:11 Henize: Okay. Number 1 is, inspect the general area - this is sort of a general point of view - inspect the general area around the V over H sensor and comment on any evidence of thermal or mechanical degradation. And 2, 3, 4, and 5 are sort of more specifically. Number 2. Is there any evidence of V over H sensor lens cracking, or debris on the lens? In other words, have a good check of the lens itself. Number 3. Is any large amount of the black paint around the V over H sensor opening missing? Number 4. Is the plume shield in place around the V over H sensor opening? And the plume shield is what I'd generally call the - or - the - it's the guard around the lens sticking out about 3 inches [75 mm] there. And, number 5. Is anything obviously obstructing the V over H sensor field of view? [Pause.]
Diagram showing layout of SIM bay.
This illustration, taken from the J-mission Apollo News Reference, shows the layout of the SIM bay. The V over H sensor is to the lower right of the Panoramic Camera's lens. Though difficult to see on this picture, its plume shield is like a lens hood projecting forward. During the EVA, Al will engage his feet in the foot restraint to the left. Facing right, he will have access to the majority of the bay, particularly the film cassettes which he must retrieve.
241:02:25 Worden: Okay, Karl. We got all those.
241:02:29 Henize: Okey doke. No other special questions at the moment. Stand by. [Pause.]
241:02:40 Worden: Okay.
241:02:42 Scott: Okay. We'll proceed on here then.
241:02:46 Henize: Incidentally, I guess we're - we both understand each other on the status of the Mapping Camera? So far as you know, it hasn't retracted. Is that correct?
241:02:58 Worden: That is our understanding at this point. I'll let you know when I get out.
241:03:02 Henize: Roger. [Pause.]
241:03:11 Henize: Oh, Al. One more point that I overlooked down here, and that is, the people here would like to have you look at the Mass Spec. boom, Al, if it's at all feasible. If it's not convenient to look down at the base of that boom and look at the coils, forget it; but if you can get a look in there, we would expect to find a coil crossover jamming down in the base there, and we'd like to have your visual confirmation of that.
241:03:39 Worden: Roger, Karl. I had intended to do that.
Towards the latter part of the spacecraft's time in lunar orbit, Al began having problems retracting the boom carrying the Mass Spectrometer. This problem is discussed more fully earlier in this journal but its essence is that the boom mechanism sticks when it becomes cold.
241:03:41 Henize: Very good. [Long pause.]
The next exchanges are the crew's comm checks. Dave and Jim will use a PTT (Push to Talk) switch. Al will be on VOX, his transmissions being made automatically by a voice-operated switch. In the available air/ground recording for the next few seconds, Dave's challenges are very faint. Al's responses are clear.
241:04:02 Worden: Rog. That's on.

241:04:53 Worden: Rog.
241:04:55 Scott: And Houston, Endeavour. I guess the comm's acceptable to you down there on - with Al on VOX. Is that correct?
241:05:02 Henize: Roger. We're reading him loud and clear.

241:31:53 Scott: Cabin pressure's approaching 6, and I'll crack the side hatch valve just a bit.
241:31:59 Irwin: Yep.
Comm break.
Worden, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "There was a lot of discussion about cracking the side hatch valve to maintain the cabin pressure during the EVA prep. That's particularly true when I was flowing through the umbilical. I thought that operation worked very well. I didn't see any problem at all with opening the side hatch valve just a little bit to relieve the cabin pressure."
Scott, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "Except that it was easier for me to do it than it was for you."
Worden, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "That's right."
241:33:02 Scott: ...valve is on there now. Keep an eye on it.

241:54:32 Worden: Off. [Pause.]
241:54:43 Irwin: Reading 300. [Long pause.]
241:55:04 Scott: Okay, Houston; 15. We've got a good integrity check on the CMP, and standing by for a Go for depress from... [Long pause.]
241:55:23 Worden: Dave, would you turn my suit diverter valve, please.
241:55:31 Henize: We copy, 15. And you have a Go for depress.
The main, or side hatch has a depressurisation valve built into it. It is operated by releasing a handle and winding the valve open. The crew are only 4 minutes behind their planned timeline.
241:55:37 Scott: Roger.
241:55:38 Worden: Are they vertical now? [Pause.]
241:55:50 Worden: Other side too. Two of 'em.
241:55:52 Scott: Yeah. [Pause.]
241:56:02 Scott: Okay. You guys ready? Okay. Houston, 15. The side hatch dump valve is coming open.
241:56:14 Henize: 15, Houston copies. [Long pause.]
Cabin pressure coming down.
241:56:47 Worden: Rog. [Pause.]
241:56:54 Scott: Want to stop there?
241:56:58 Worden: Well, okay. Think it's probably easier than I can. [Long pause.]
241:57:37 Scott: Reading 4.0. Go to 'em.
Comm break.
241:58:51 Scott: Yeah, it does. [Long pause.]
Cabin at 1½ pounds per square inch.
241:59:21 Worden: Reading 3.8 on mine. [Long pause.]
Half a pound cabin pressure now.
242:00:16 Worden: Roger. Fine. [Long pause.]
242:00:35 Scott: Okay.
Comm break.

242:01:38 Worden: Yeah. It makes a difference. It's still flowing into the cabin.
242:01:42 Scott: How can you read me? You read me okay? Good. [Long pause.]
242:01:55 Worden: You hear my VOX cut in and out? Good.
Heart rates: Worden and Irwin in the 70's, Scott in the 60's.
Mention of the crew's heart rates brings up the point that after the flight Dave had concerns as to whether Jim should have gone through the hatch for this EVA in light of the heart rhythm irregularities seen by the ground
Scott, from 2004 mission review: "I think we should have had a discussion. We had a private loop. We could have had a comms loop discussion with the Flight Director and whoever, and they could have said, 'Jim's got a problem,' and we probably would have changed the EVA procedures."
Scott, from 2004 mission review: "We could have switched - I just sat in the left couch. I didn't do anything. Jim didn't have a big job but he was standing in the hatch, helping Al. Suppose he had had a heart attack and died? Would have been a bad day. Would have been better to put Jim in the left couch and let him just relax, and let me do his job, which wasn't a big deal. But nevertheless, I'd have switched it."
Woods, from 2004 mission review: "Had something happened, you would have been in a more secure position."
Scott, from 2004 mission review: "Yeah. I mean if I had known Jim had a problem, then I would have said, 'Let's switch roles for Al's EVA and you just sit there in the couch and watch the world go by.'"
Harland, from 2004 mission review: "Well you'd done a head-out-of-the-hatch on [Apollo] 9 so you know what's involved there."
Scott, from 2004 mission review: "Yeah. I'd understand the hatch. Yeah. At the very least, we'd have had a nice discussion with the Flight Director, 'nice' being full disclosure of the situation and full discussion of what's the best thing to do."
242:02:19 Scott: Yeah. Okay. You ready? [Pause.]
242:02:28 Scott: I suspect that SCU is forward enough to keep it there. [Long pause.]
242:03:01 Worden: It'll hold. Now. [Pause.]
242:03:12 Worden: It's released. It's in the yellow?
242:03:18 Worden: No. We've missed it.
242:03:20 Scott: Yeah. I can't see it. Jim, can you see the indicator?
242:03:23 Irwin: I can't either, can you?
242:03:27 Scott: Stand by one.
242:03:30 Worden: Rog. [Garble.] [Pause.]
242:03:39 Scott: Houston, 15. We're getting ready to open the hatch. How does everything look to you down there?
242:03:49 Henize: Roger, Al. Everything's looking good to us here.
242:03:53 Worden: ...out, Dave.
242:03:56 Scott: Okay? Unlatch. Unlatch. Ready? Rog. [Pause.]
242:04:19 Worden: No.
TV transmission from the spacecraft begins about now. The following video file begins at 242:04:23.
H.264 MP4 video file.
242:04:23 Henize: 15, Houston. We don't see the TV camera on yet.
242:04:25 Worden: The hatch is open.
242:04:29 Scott: Huh. Oh, we haven't got it out yet. We'll have it out there in a minute. It should be on though.
Al's EVA has been described as the first interplanetary spacewalk, in an age that placed much prestige on space "firsts". Apart from the three Apollo EVAs to retrieve SIM bay film cassettes, every other EVA from a spacecraft in freefall has taken place in low Earth orbit, never more than about 600 kilometres away from the home planet. This was still true at the time of writing thirty years after the event.
Scott, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "Hatch opening occurred about 5 minutes after the planned hatch opening. The integrity checks went very well. The procedures played just exactly as they were laid out in the checklist and just like we've seen them in the chamber. I'm glad we ran those chamber runs because that helped us, Jim and I, to understand what you were doing with your equipment."
Worden, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "I think so, too. We were all well prepared for the EVA."
242:04:33 Worden: Okay. I got the latch - the handle and latch.
242:04:39 Scott: Rog. Rog.
242:04:46 Worden: Okay. [Long pause.]
242:05:09 Worden: Okay. [Garble].
242:05:16 Worden: [Garble] zero. Clips. [Pause.]
242:05:32 Worden: Jettison bag is gone. [Pause.] And jettison bag number 2. [Long pause.]
242:05:50 Worden: Okay. [Long pause.]
Worden, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "After getting the hatch open, the first thing I did was take the TV and the DAC and mount them on the bracket in the hatch. The hatch didn't get fully opened the first time. When I got part way out, I guess you opened the hatch the rest of the way so that the camera was pointing down along the SIM bay. I just went outside the hatch, grabbed the first handrail, and positioned myself just outside the hatch until Jim got in the hatch to observe and to watch the umbilical."
Later in the Technical Debrief, when the crew discuss simulations, Al discusses the training he did in the WIF (Water Immersion Facility). This technique, where an EVA crewmember dons a spacesuit, modified for use underwater and weighted to give neutral buoyancy, to give an impression of how the body moves in a zero-g environment has become the preferred method of training for the lengthy EVAs performed almost routinely in low Earth orbit.
Worden, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "I thought the training program for the EVA was just right. There wasn't too much. I thought there was an adequate amount of training. The sessions in the WIF could have been reduced somewhat because the sensation of neutral buoyancy is sufficiently removed from zero-g that with too much training in the WIF, it almost turns out to be negative training. The operation is so much more difficult in the WIF than it is in flight or in the zero-g airplane that fewer sessions in the WIF would have been in order. Maybe one or two sessions in the WIF, instead of a large number of them, would be perfectly adequate. The zero-g airplane was invaluable. The one-g trainer going through the prep and the post was completely adequate. I thought that particular training program was outstanding."
We're getting a picture now.
242:06:21 Scott: Okay, Houston. You should be getting a picture about now.
242:06:27 Henize: Roger, 15. We're getting a signal. [Long pause.]
242:07:08 Worden: Okay. [Pause.]
242:07:12 Worden: Okay. Fine. First thing is that the map - the Mapping Camera is all the way out. [Pause.]
242:07:27 Scott: Okay. [Pause.]
242:07:34 Scott: Okay. [Long pause.]
242:07:52 Henize: 15, this is Houston. We're getting a clear picture now, but the aiming of the TV camera is poor. Is it possible to open the hatch wider?
242:08:10 Scott: Yeah, that's what - we're - we're looking at that, too. Stand by one, and we'll do that. [Long pause.]
242:08:44 Worden: Yeah, I can see the TV is pointed right at the Command Module there. Right at the interface.
242:08:51 Henize: That's affirm.
242:08:57 Scott: Push it back a little there, Jim.
242:08:59 Scott: No problem.
242:09:00 Scott: Okay.
242:09:11 Henize: That's excellent.
242:09:13 Scott: You should have a picture at a man in space.
242:09:15 Henize: Very good. [Pause.]
242:09:20 Worden: Okay. You ready, Jim? I'll work my way down. Okay, it's reading 4. Okay. [Long pause.]
Distance 171,000 [nautical] miles [316,691 km].
Diagram showing how Worden will manoeuvre along the Service Module.
This illustration outlines how Al is to progress along from the CM hatch to the foot restraints in the SIM bay. Having exited the CM (1), he uses handholds mounted all along the side of the Service Module (2) until he is over the bay (3). Further handholds surrounding the SIM bay allow him to rotate (4) until his feet are in the correct position to engage them in the foot restraint (5), giving him full access to the bay.
Worden, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "I went hand-over-hand down the SIM bay and to the left around the Mapping Camera. I just floated myself over the Mapping Camera instead of going around it down into the SIM bay. I put my feet in the foot restraints and just stood there for a minute, resting and looking at the SIM bay, and waiting for Jim to get himself positioned in the hatch."
Jim starts the 16mm Maurer movie camera about now using film magazine F and we can make a comparison with the video coverage to pin down the time. Unfortunately, the camera jams after exposing one frame. Dave's next utterance confirms the timing of this event.
Single still frame from 16mm magazine F of Al Worden carrying out an EVA to retrieve film canisters from the SIM bay.
242:09:50 Scott: We'll have your picture back in a minute, Houston. We're turning on the 16-millimeter.
242:09:58 Henize: We copy.
242:09:59 Scott: Yes. [Pause.]
242:10:07 Scott: Okay. [Long pause.]
242:10:40 Worden: Okay. I'm in the foot restraint.
242:10:45 Henize: Yeah, that's good work up there, Al. [Long pause.]
242:11:37 Worden: Okay, the Pan Camera cassette is tethered. There's the pip pin. [Long pause.]
Worden's heart rate about 130 now.
242:12:32 Scott: Good.
Comm break.
Worden, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "The Pan Camera went just as I had anticipated it would go. I pulled the metallic cover off the Pan Camera and released it. Then, I pulled the fabric cover off. The force that it took to pull both of those covers off was just as I had expected and remembered from preflight. It was the same operation. I pulled the pin on the Pan Camera cassette, tethered myself to it, and pulled the release handle. It came out even easier than I had expected. The mass of the Pan Camera cassette was a little bit more than I had expected, but it was no problem handling it. I just very carefully drifted it back towards the hatch, keeping my hand on the handle and maneuvering myself back. I did release it at one time, because I had to use both hands to maneuver myself over the Mapping Camera. But I didn't release it clear to the end of the tether. I just let go for a minute, repositioned myself, and then grabbed it with the handle again. I thought that went very smoothly."
Irwin's heart rate 116, Scott's 71.
There's the film cassette.
242:13:43 Scott: Get it inside there, if you can, Jim. Get it inside. [Long pause.]
242:14:26 Irwin: Okay.
242:14:30 Scott: Rog. Would you like to exchange - would you like to get hold of it? [Laughter.] [Pause.]
242:14:41 Worden: That's the Pan Camera [cassette], right.
242:14:43 Scott: Okay, Houston. The Pan Camera is safely inside.
242:14:47 Worden: Hold it.
Worden, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "The transfer back through the hatch went just as we'd done before, too. I handed the Pan Camera cassette back in through the hatch. You tethered it and then released my tether. That was pretty much as we'd done before; no problems there."
Scott, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "I put it down in the LEB and it stayed. I left it on the tether and it never got in your way. No problem."
242:14:42 Scott: Jim, hold this.
242:14:53 Henize: Beautiful job, Al baby. Remember - remember, there is no hurry up there at all.
242:15:02 Worden: Rog, Karl. I'm enjoying it. [Long pause.]
Going back for the Mapping Camera cassette now.
At some point during the EVA, Jim takes five photographs with a Hasselblad camera using magazine Q.

242:15:35 Worden: Okay, Houston. Rest break. We'll take a look at the V over H sensor.
242:15:41 Henize: Very good.
242:15:48 Worden: Uh, hum, I see nothing on the V over H sensor. There's no back - black paint missing. There's nothing obscuring the field of view. The glass is not cracked. [Pause.]
242:16:13 Worden: The shield is not obstructing the field of view. There's nothing in the way, Karl.
242:16:21 Henize: We...
242:16:22 Worden: It's perfectly clear.
242:16:23 Henize: We copy your report, Al. Thank you.
242:16:29 Worden: Okay. And as I look around, the Mass Spec. is - oh, it looks like about - not quite in - the cover. It looks like maybe it's the cover that's jammed. Yes, in fact, it is the cover that's jammed. See?
242:16:57 Henize: Roger, Al. We copy. That was most unexpected news.
242:16:59 Worden: No, I can't tell from here. I can't really - I can't really tell from here, Karl, whether it's the cover or not. I thought the cover was jammed. One corner of the cover is overlapping a - side section of insulation which I wasn't expecting it to. But it doesn't seem to be - it doesn't put any force on it - on the Mass Spec. If I could get around and take a look at it. [Pause.] The Mass Spec. is in the guide pins, and the Mass Spec. looks like as it is fully retracted. [Pause.] The Mass Spec. is fully retracted, Karl.
242:17:57 Henize: Roger, Al. We're reading you loud and clear.
242:17:59 Worden: Any - any diffi - any difficulties with the talkback has to be associated with that cover, because the cover is not closed. How far through the slot should the guide pin come on the - on the reel?
242:18:18 Henize: Stand by, Al.
242:18:21 Worden: Okay. 'Cause I can see a guide pin coming through. You do that, and I'll get the map - Mapping Camera.
Comm break.
Worden, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "The Inconel cover on the Mass Spectrometer was cocked about 30 degrees from the closed position. I reached over and grabbed the cover and moved it a little bit. It's a fairly flimsy cover, but I wanted to see if it was jammed against anything. One corner seemed to be hung up. I released it, but the cover stayed where it was. I really couldn't close it. Then, I looked down inside the Mass Spec. itself and noticed that the guidepins were through the guide slots in the experiment itself, indicating that it had at least positioned itself on the base of the boom itself. I wasn't sure at the time. That's something I hadn't looked at preflight. I wasn't sure just how far those guidepins should come through the slots to indicate that the Mass Spectrometer was fully retracted. So I called down to the ground and said that the tip of the guidepins were just through the guideslot. They called back and said that it wasn't fully retracted then, because the guidepins should be through the slots far enough so that the cylindrical part of the guidepin could be seen. So, that indicated to me that the Mass Spectrometer wasn't fully retracted. That was all I could see on it. I couldn't see around the Mass Spectrometer. I couldn't see down into the SIM bay at that point because the cover was obscuring the view."
Worden's heart rate 97 now.
242:19:39 Worden: Okay, Jim. I'm ready to bring the other one back. [Long pause.]
242:20:03 Henize: Hey, Al. It looks like you're running a pass up there. That's beautiful. [Long pause.]
And there was the Mapping Camera cassette.
242:20:27 Worden: Okay. [Long pause.]
Worden, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "I pulled the cover off the Mapping Camera, I noticed that that particular cover was a little more difficult to release than I had anticipated. That particular cover is set under a flange on either side. It's held down by some pins at the release end of the cover. I had to twist it a little bit and pull it a lot harder than I had anticipated to release it from the flanges on the side. But, it did come off all right; there was no problem. The fabric cover underneath got hung up on one corner. The fabric has a rubber slot that it fits into around the edges, and it's almost an airtight seal. That rubber-slotted flange hung up in one corner, and I had to pull it three or four times before I got it released. After that, everything was just as I had anticipated."
Worden (continued): "I tethered the Mapping Camera cassette, released it, and it was a very easy operation after that. I brought it back into the hatch, as we had practised preflight."
242:21:10 Worden: Jim, you look absolutely fantastic against that Moon back there. That is really a most unbelievable, remarkable thing.
Al's view of Jim at this point was the inspiration for a painting of the scene by Pierre Mion for National Geographic.

242:21:25 Scott: Okay, Houston. The Mapping Camera cassette is inside.
242:21:30 Henize: We copy. [Pause.]
242:21:42 Worden: Houston, is there anything else you want me to check in the SIM bay before we go back in?
242:21:52 Henize: Al, we'd be...
242:21:53 Worden: Is there anything on the Mapping Camera I can check?
242:21:55 Henize: Al, we'd be pleased to have any general comments you had about the SIM bay experiments, otherwise than what we specifically asked you. Did everything look in order?
242:22:05 Worden: Okay. Well, everything looked good, as far as I could tell, except for the cover on the Mass Spec., and the fact that the Mapping Camera is up. Maybe I could take another quick check back here and see if I can see anything on the Mapping Camera.
242:22:23 Henize: Rog. [Long pause.]
Worden, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "I think the concern at the time was that the Laser Altimeter/Mapping Camera contamination cover was binding against the side - forcing it to stay in the Extend position. I went back out and looked, and there was about three-fourths of an inch to maybe 1 inch clearance between the cover and the Mapping Camera itself. From that, I concluded that the cover hadn't anything to do with it. I looked underneath the Mapping Camera, and I looked around all of the edges to see if there was something binding, maybe something that had lodged alongside the Mapping Camera. Everything looked clean to me. There was nothing that was impinging on the Mapping Camera at all. The stellar shield was still out, but of course, it would be with the camera extended. At that point, it was maybe 12 to 15 inches away from the SIM bay mold line. So, there was nothing I could tell from there that would shed any light on why the Mapping Camera did not retract."
242:23:11 Worden: Okay. You ready guys?
242:23:16 Scott: All right. [Long pause.]
Worden's heart rate 85 now.
242:23:40 Worden: Oh, just a second. I've got get the mast and get the TV. [Long pause.]
242:23:54 Worden: Okay. TV coming in. Got it, Dave? Okay.
242:24:03 Scott: Okay, take your time.
242:24:05 Worden: I - I'm doing fine. [Long pause.]
242:24:20 Worden: Okay. [Long pause.]
242:24:33 Worden: Hung up - on something. [Long pause.]
242:24:58 Scott: Ah, yeah, it's about the same place it was when we opened the hatch. [Long pause.]
242:25:15 Worden: Okay. Hatch is locked.
Worden, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "I went back in the hatch, pulled the quick release on the TV camera bracket, which we had decided to do preflight. Rather than releasing the handle itself, we pulled the Marmon clamp, releasing the pole. I sent the pole in the hatch, backed into the hatch myself, and pulled the hatch closed. I thought that went very easy. It took hardly any force at all to close the hatch. It operated very smoothly and very freely. I pulled it right down to the point where it was closed. A couple of pumps on the handle, and the latches were over and off. It was very simple operation."
242:25:21 Scott: Neutral. Gear box is in latch. [Pause.]
242:25:35 Worden: Can you do it, Dave? Okay.
242:25:40 Henize: 15, Houston. You can turn off the TV anytime you like.
242:25:47 Scott: Let us get depr - get pressurized first, Karl.
242:25:52 Irwin: Okay. [Pause.]
Worden, from the 1971 Technical debrief: "Once we got the side hatch open, from that point to the time we closed the hatch, the whole operation went almost exactly as it had in preflight training, both in the zero-g airplane and the Water Immersion Facility. I don't recall anything during the EVA that I thought was off-nominal. As a matter of fact, it was so much like preflight, that I really had no anxieties about the EVA at all. The whole thing went just as smooth as it could."
Worden (continued): "It was just as we practised. That's the key to the whole thing - good solid practice before flight. Be well prepared for what's going to be out there and for the kind of body motions that are required to get back into the SIM bay and into the foot restraints."
Worden (continued): "In true zero-g it was really much easier than it had been even in the zero-g airplane. I think there's some rotation that you get in the zero-g airplane that does affect your motions a little bit. True zero-g is just much easier. If you can do it in a zero-g airplane and in the Water Immersion Facility, in flight it is easy."
242:25:59 Scott: Can you get it there?
242:26:00 Worden: Okay.
242:26:01 Scott: Very good. [Pause.]
242:26:10 Worden: Okay. [Long pause.]
242:26:41 Irwin: Tell me when to close it. [Pause.] That's it. [Pause.]
242:26:57 Worden: [Garbled.] Take it down here before it's too - okay, okay.
242:27:09 Scott: Okay?
Cabin pressure coming up now.
242:27:11 Worden: I said, I wish I were back outside. It's hell in here. Okay.
242:27:18 Irwin: Closed. [Pause.]
242:27:24 Worden: I can't. No. [Pause.] Yeah. That's okay, Jim. [Pause.]
242:27:43 Irwin: How's that? There we go. Now we should get our positions straight. You see it now, Dave? Okay. Make sure we got a good seal. [Long pause.]
242:28:08 Irwin (onboard): Cool it here for a minute.
242:28:22 Scott: Okay, Houston; 15. It looks like we got a good seal. How's it look down there? [Long pause.]
242:28:38 Henize: 15, Houston. Your seal looks good to us.
242:28:44 Scott: Okay, thank you. Okay, 601, Open?
Scott (onboard): 601, Repress O2, Open.
242:28:52 Worden: It's Open.
242:28:53 Scott (onboard): Monitor Repress O2 indicator to zero.
242:29:03 Worden: and it looks zero now, Dave? [Pause.]
242:29:04 Scott (onboard): Okay. So, you let your umbilical flow bring every - the cabin up to 3.
242:29:10 Scott [Worden in onboard transcript]: Rog. [Long pause.]
Cabin pressure 2 pounds.
242:29:11 Scott (onboard): That's very nicely done. That's about - 22 minutes. Which is just about what we figured. You went back and looked at all that stuff. So that's just about right.
242:29:52 Scott (onboard): It's fun out there, isn't it?
242:29:54 Scott: Mm-hmm. Should have stayed longer.
Comm break.
Al gets a question along the same lines during the inflight press conference tomorrow. When asked why he came in so soon, he answered that he came in when the job was done. The following interview with Dave, conducted in 2004, was before I discovered it was Worden who said he should have stayed out longer.
Woods, from 2004 mission review: "Al seemed to spend an awful short time outside. You told him you should have stayed there longer. He was all for get out there, do the job, get back in. That seems a bit of a shame from his point of view."
O'Brien, from 2004 mission review: "I would imagine that you would have a little bit of free time, but this wasn't time critical. You were plugged into the CSM. You weren't in a rush."
Scott, from 2004 mission review: "Weren't in a rush, but on the other hand, the purpose was to get the film and get back in. I think Al did the right thing. Came back in. I mean, it'd be nice to stay out and float around and look around but, why? So if you stay out and float around and look around and then something goes wrong during that period, then you say, 'Why did I do that?' So I think what you do is you do your job and you get back in and close the hatch and say, 'Gee, that was wonderful. I had a great time. I did my job.' I think to float around out there is exposing yourself to an unnecessary risk. It's low risk, but on the other hand, it's high risk. So what if that last minute is a time you popped a leak for some reason? Eh? So shoot, get the job over. As sort of an analogy, we used to fly airplanes in bad weather. Rule was always; go to your destination, finish your mission and then play around because if you got to get down, you got fuel."
Woods, from 2004 mission review: "You say to him here, 'You should have stayed longer.'"
Scott, from 2004 mission review: "He got it done very quickly and very efficiently and came back in and the comment is, 'Geeze, you were having a good time. Why didn't you stay a while?' But I didn't really mean that. I meant it in a positive way. 'You should have stayed out there and stayed longer. You were doing really great, terrific.' But if you look at the seriousness of it, he did exactly right. He got his job done and he got in."
Woods, from 2004 mission review: "On both of your Apollo flights, somebody went out through the main hatch of the Command Module. That's an impressive piece of engineering, an outgoing door that holds against 5 or 6 psi. After the Apollo 1 tragedy, were you involved at all in the redesign of that?"
Scott, from 2004 mission review: "Yeah. They had all these working groups to fix all the problems. Not just the fire-related problems. All the problems kind of stuff. And I was on the working group with the probe and drogue and with the hatch and with the EMS and something else. But, yeah, I was pretty much in the middle. And in the hatch thing, they brought McDonnell Douglas guys in to really help them with that."
O'Brien, from 2004 mission review: "Really?"
Scott, from 2004 mission review: "Yeah, well, Gemini had an outward-opening hatch, right? They brought in the MacDac guys to help the Rockwell guys redesign the hatch."
Woods, from 2004 mission review: "And as it happened, you were the first person to really test it on Apollo 9."
Scott, from 2004 mission review: "Ah, but it worked. It was really a good hatch."
The cabin's at 2.3 now. They'll bring it up to 3 pounds using the spacecraft system. Then they will dump the OPS, the emergency oxygen backpack that Al Worden carried with him. They'll dump that at 3 pounds to bring the cabin pressure on up.
242:29:57 Scott (onboard): (Laughter) You done good. You made a lot of people back there very happy.
242:30:04 Worden (onboard): Roll over and let me take another look again.
242:30:11 Scott (onboard): Well, I'll tell you what, your - your left arm or something's covering up the light over there.
242:30:16 Worden (onboard): The OPS is, I guess.
242:30:19 Scott (onboard): Really bad lights in here.
242:30:20 Worden (onboard): Okay, there. I can see it now.
242:30:23 Scott (onboard): We're at 2.4, about. So we'll just let your flow bring it up to 3. Gee, I had a great view on the TV. Did you turn the TV off, Jim?
242:30:39 Irwin (onboard): No, I didn't...
242:30:40 Worden (onboard): I'll turn it off.
242:30:41 Scott (onboard): Can you reach it?
242:30:42 Worden (onboard): Yes. There. Thought I turned it off.
242:30:53 Scott (onboard): Can you reach the Scientific TV switch? The S-band TV switch, Jim?
242:30:59 Irwin (onboard): No, not yet, Dave.
242:31:01 Scott (onboard): Okay. Maybe I can. No.
242:31:06 Irwin (onboard): I don't think there's any rush on that, is it?
242:31:08 Scott (onboard): No.

242:33:00 Henize: Fif - 15, Houston. As long as we have the TV camera on, go - go to Average, and we should get a better picture down here.
242:33:11 Scott: Well, it's just down in the LEB sort of stowed away, but we'll do that. [Pause.]
242:33:26 Scott: We're just not in a position to get the panel 3 switch right now.
242:33:31 Henize: We - we copy, and that's fine. [Long pause.]
242:33:50 Scott: You may have something on your picture, now.
Long comm break.

That's the hatch window in the background there.
242:37:18 Worden: Cabin pressure rate is coming up.
242:37:22 Irwin: They're out of lockup.
Comm break.
Cabin pressure is up to 4½ pounds per square inch and the consensus in the control center is that that was reflection of lights in the cabin that you saw in the hatch window.
Heart rates far Worden and Irwin now in the low 70's, for Dave Scott, high 50's.
The cabin's up to 5 pounds per square inch.
Apollo 15's distance from Earth now 170,172 nautical miles [318,158 km]. Velocity, 3,016 feet per second [919 m/s].
242:40:37 Irwin [Worden in onboard transcript]: I'll get it. [Long pause.]
242:40:38 Scott (onboard): Here, give me it first, Al.
242:41:02 Scott: Got it.
242:41:03 Worden: PGA pressure. [Long pause.]
242:41:23 Worden: [Garble].
242:41:25 Scott: Yes.
242:41:26 Worden: [Garble].
This is Apollo Control. The EVA clock here in the control center recorded 39 minutes, 56 seconds [total EVA time].
242:41:31 Scott: On.
242:41:35 Scott: Why don't you do it so I don't get my gloves dirty. Get my helmet. Get that stuff off and leave them.
Comm break.
And that time is about - from about midway during depressurization to midway in repressurization.
EVA times are measured from the time cabin pressure indicates less than 3.5 psi until it rises above this figure again. Although nearly 40 minutes were clocked for the EVA, the hatch was only open for twenty of those, though the Flight Plan had 53 minutes set aside for it.

242:45:59 Henize: 15, Houston. We see your cabin at 6.1 [psi]. You might want to keep a close eye on that.
242:46:09 Scott: Okay; we'll do that. Thank you.
Long comm break.
The crew are raising the cabin pressure by bleeding the contents of the OPS oxygen bottle. The Flight Plan calls for them to do this until the bottle is depleted. However, on this occasion, doing so provides too much air. With the cabin repressurised, they can doff their suits and begin configuring the cabin for the rest of the journey home.
This is Apollo Control. We have some unofficial times on some of these EVA events. The Go for depressurization was given at 241 hours, 55 minutes, 33 seconds. Depressurization started at 241:56:12; hatch open, 242:05:33; Worden going out the hatch, 242:07:29; hatch coming closed, 242:25:20; and the pressure - cabin pressure starting to come back up at 242:27:25.
With the cabin returned to pressure, the crew can settle down for the remainder of their day which will be taken up with UV photography, a little bit of X-ray astronomy and another period of onboard navigation exercises using Program 23.
