Apollo 11 landing from PDI to Touchdown
An annotated portrayal of the Apollo 11 landing on the Moon with captions to explain the various stages of the descent. This is part of the Apollo Flight Journal, Apollo 11 collection.
Apollo 11 Onboard 16-mm film footage
Apollo 11 - 16-mm magazine 1116-A
The second stage of the Transposition, Docking and Extraction task begins with a glimpse of Earth as the CSM turns to face the LM, Eagle, parked in the top of the S-IVB third stage. The major part of the film shows the top of the LM growing in the field of view as the CSM approaches until the overhead window of the LM dominates. Soft dock is at 01:41. Retraction of the docking probe occurs soon after with hard dock being achieved at 01:51. This video is presented at 24 frames per second, regardless of the original shooting speed.
H.264 MOV video file.
Apollo 11 - 16-mm magazine 1118-B
Interior shots of the Apollo 11 crew filmed at variable frame rates. 00:25 Armstrong and Aldrin in the Command Module. 00:40 camera moves from the CM to the Lunar Module where Aldrin is giving the spacecraft a checkout. The lens of the TV camera is visible on the right as Armstrong is sending live video to Earth. 01:20 Collins in the Lower Equipment Bay. 01:28 Collins deals with a plethora of packages at a storage cupboard in the Lower Equipment Bay. 01:32 Collins is shaving. 01:41 Close-up of Aldrin. This video is presented at 24 frames per second, regardless of the original shooting speed.

Apollo 11 - 16-mm magazine 1121-C
00:31 Lunar Module Eagle undocks from Command Service Module Columbia and performs manoeuvres to allow Michael Collins to inspect the spacecraft externally. Undocking occurs at 01:00. This video is presented at 24 frames per second, regardless of the original shooting speed. Its image has been flipped to counter the fact that it was shot into a mirror.

Apollo 11 - 16-mm magazine 1122-D
00:25 Coverage of the final moments of rendezvous of the ascent stage of the Lunar Module Eagle with the Command Service Module Columbia, as filmed by Collins aboard the CSM. At the start of the filming, the LM is in the lower left third, most easily identifiable by the flash of its strobe light. 03:16 Armstrong initiates a pitch down manoeuvre to face the LM docking port towards the CSM. 03:38 Armstrong carried out an unplanned yaw manoeuvre to deal with sunlight coming in his overhead window. This causes the guidance platform to go into gimbal lock and Armstrong has to use the backup guidance system to control the spacecraft's attitude. 04:13 Earth comes into view. This video is presented at 24 frames per second, regardless of the original shooting speed. Its image has been flipped to counter the fact that it was shot into a mirror.

Apollo 11 - 16-mm magazine 1127-G
00:31 unintentional dark shots within LM cabin. 00:49 Command Service Module Columbia filmed shortly after undocking. 01:09 CSM appears abeam of Crater Anville in Mare Fecunditatis. 01:32 CSM over southern Mare Tranquillitatis, between Boot Hill and Crater Maskelyne at 01:43. 02:16 Abeam of what will later be named Crater Armstrong. 02:31 CSM appears just right of what will shortly become the Apollo 11 landing site. This video is presented at 24 frames per second, regardless of the original shooting speed.

Apollo 11 - 16-mm magazine 1079-H
View from Aldrin's window of ascent from lunar surface. Note that Aldrin began filming shortly after launch. 02:25 Aldrin changes the speed of filming, probably from 12 to 6 frames per second. 02:39 The southern rim of Crater Sabine appears. 02:51 Crater Schmidt. 03:08 The oscillations in Eagle's attitude stop, probably indicating the moment of orbital insertion. The film ends just after they pass Crater Godin. This video is presented at 24 frames per second, regardless of the original shooting speed.
