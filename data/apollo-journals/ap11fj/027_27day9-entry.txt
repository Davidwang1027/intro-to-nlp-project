As the mission of Apollo 11 comes to a close, the crew jettison their Service Module and watch it manoeuvre away automatically. A skipping re-entry is followed by a safe splashdown in the Pacific Ocean southwest of Hawaii.
Diagram illustrating Apollo's approach path to Earth.
An Apollo re-entry, when falling all the way from the Moon, is a delicate balancing act between multiple objectives and constraints. The CM's trajectory as it approached Earth, was set to miss the planet's surface by about 40 kilometres as it swung around. Were there no atmosphere to slow it down from a velocity exceeding 11 kilometres per second, it would head back out into cislunar space to a distance further out than the Moon. Such an orbit would take weeks rather than days and given that the CM only has sufficient consumables for a few hours, this would be lethal to the crew.
Diagram illustrating how the atmosphere slows the spacecraft down.
Happily, the atmosphere does provide a convenient means of slowing the CM without using rockets, provided it is carefully managed. If the CM enters too steeply, the deceleration would be very high and likely injurious, even lethal to the crew. Further, the heat of re-entry could overwhelm the ability of the heatshield to withstand the punishment. These issues can be avoided by coming in at a shallow angle. However, if it is too shallow, the CM may not encounter sufficiently dense air to slow it down enough to avoid going back into orbit. The size of any resulting orbit is dependent on how much speed is lost and the crucial value is about 7.8 km per second. This is VCIRC, the velocity that would support a circular orbit around Earth. Once the spacecraft gets below that, Earth landing on this pass is assured. Engineers determined that an entry angle of -6.5° would be a suitable compromise. This would result in a tolerable peak deceleration of between 6 and 7 g's and there would be little chance of the spacecraft exiting the atmosphere while still travelling at above VCIRC. In terms of heat tolerance, it turned out that the Apollo heatshield was over-designed for the entry profile that was eventually used and could therefore have sustained far greater punishment than was taken.
Apollo 11's entry is unique among all the Apollo lunar re-entries because it was deliberately designed to make a small upwards skip-out after it had passed VCIRC in order to have it fly over inclement weather at the original landing site.

This is Apollo Control at 194 hours, 10 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 8 thousand, 5 hun...
194:10:13 Evans: Apollo 11, Houston.
194:10:16 Aldrin: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
194:10:17 Evans: Rog. We have our updated state vector out there for you. Request P00 and Accept. Over. [Pause.]
194:10:28 Aldrin: Okay. You've got it.
194:10:32 Evans: Okay. Here it comes.

A state vector is a package of six numbers relevant to a particular time that, within a 3-axis coordinate system, defines the spacecraft's position and its velocity. The primary method of determining the state vector is through radio tracking from Earth. If this is done, then the updated values must be uplinked to the computer's erasable memory directly from Mission Control. To achieve this, CapCom asks for the Uptelemetry switch to be changed from Block to Accept.
Spacecraft distance is 8,393 nautical miles [15,544 km]. Velocity; 19,512 feet per second [5,947 m/s]. Rescue and ARIA aircraft are reported on station, and the Hornet's helicopters containing the swimmers are reported airborne. Swim One is helicopter number 53. Three swimmers from that helo are expected to place the collar on the spacecraft, flotation collar. Crew of Swim One consists of Lieutenant Commander Donald G. Pitchmand, pilot.
According to a list of key Apollo 11 personnel on the website of the National Air & Space Museum, the pilot of Swim 1 was Donald Richmon.
194:11:55 Evans: Apollo 11, Houston.
194:11:58 Armstrong: Go ahead.
194:12:00 Evans: Roger. The computer is yours now. Looks like you're in VHF range, here. So we'll try a VHF check for you. We'll just send the VHF up to you. Stand by.
194:12:11 Armstrong: Okay.
194:12:25 Evans: Apollo 11, Houston. VHF check on Simplex Alpha. Over.
194:12:32 Aldrin: Roger, Houston. Apollo 11, VHF Simplex Alpha, loud and clear. How me? Over.
194:12:38 Evans: Roger, 11. Houston. You're loud. The standard VHF noise, though, makes you realize that S-band is good.
194:12:48 Aldrin: Roger. Understand. Thank you. [Long pause.]
194:13:19 Evans: Apollo 11, Houston. Backup S-band now, and we're standing by for Command Module RCS activation.
194:13:27 Aldrin: Okay. We're just about there.
Comm break.
Swim One's pilot, Commander Pitchmand, is from Orlando, Florida. Co-pilot Lt. William W. Strawn of Plymouth, Michigan; Crewman James R. Johnson, Raleigh, North Carolina. The swimmers aboard Swim One are Lt JG John McLachlan of Spokane, Washington; Petty Officer 2nd Class Terry A. Muehlenbach, Chatsworth, California; and Petty Officer 3rd Class Mitchell L. Bucklew of Sanford, Florida. These 3 swimmers are scheduled to attach the flotation collar and then move away from the Command Module while helicopter number 66, designated Recovery One, moves into the area and deploys one swimmer, Lt. Clancey Hatelberg.
194:15:15 Evans: Apollo 11, Houston, you're Go for Pyro Arm.
194:15:19 Collins: Thank you, Houston.
Comm break.
Lt. Clancey Hatelberg of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, will deploy from Recovery One wearing a biological isolation garment and he will hand to the crew through the hatch their biological isolation garments. At 194 hours, 16 minutes; Apollo 11 is 7,512 nautical miles [13,912 km] from Earth, velocity 20,304 feet per second [6,189 m/s].
194:16:36 Evans: Apollo 11, Houston. Your Command Module pressurization looks mighty fine to us.
194:16:41 Armstrong: Looks good here, Ron.
194:16:46 Evans: And 11, Houston, I've got an update for about four items on your Entry PAD.
194:16:55 Aldrin: Ready to copy.
194:16:57 Evans: Roger. Your Max-g, 06.3; your Noun 60, your Gamma at 400k, 6.48; your range to go on the EMS, 1403.3; and your Retro time for V-circular, 02:14. Over.
194:17:40 Aldrin: Roger. Copy Max g, 6.3; R2 at Noun 60, 6.48; range to go EMS, 14033; RET V-circular, 02:14. Over.
194:17:58 Evans: Roger. Readback is correct there.
Long comm break.
To expand on the Entry PAD update, the maximum deceleration the crew should experience during the initial part of the re-entry is 6.3 g's, down from 6.4. The figure for Gamma, which is the flight path angle at Entry Interface, is now 6.48°, down from 6.49°. The 'Range-to-go' figure that will be entered into the EMS is now 1,403.3 nautical miles, down from 1,404.5. Finally, the time between Entry Interface and the moment when they are at a velocity that would support a circular orbit is now 2 minutes, 14 seconds, up from 02:13. The significance of this moment is that they would no longer have sufficient velocity to support an orbit around Earth. Such an orbit would be dangerous in a spacecraft with extremely limited consumables. Once they pass this time, their landing is assured.
The crew of helicopter 66, Recovery One; the pilot Cdr. D. S. Jones of Madison, Wisconsin; Co-pilot Lt JG Bruce A. Johnson, Bremerton, Washington; and the two crewmen who will assist the astronauts into the Helo; Chief Petty Officer Norvel L. Wood of Carmi, Illinois and Chief Petty Officer Stanley G. Robnett of Portales, Mexico - New Mexico.

194:24:37 Collins: Houston, Apollo 11.
194:24:39 Evans: Apollo 11, Houston. Go.
194:24:43 Collins: Roger. The first horizon check 194:23:06 at a pitch angle of 298 does not quite fall on the 31 7 line. It's just a little high. It's within 5 degrees tolerance.
194:24:57 Evans: Apollo 11, Houston. The horizon check there was supposed to be at 33. Over.
Collins has carried out the horizon check ten minutes early. It should have been 194:33:06.
194:25:05 Collins: Okay. That's fine, sir. Thank you.
194:25:07 Evans: Roger.

The crew will make re-entry without suits or helmets on. Although this was a controversial decision on the first Apollo flight, Apollo 7, when the crew wore suits but no helmets contrary to MCC's advice, by now it is regarded as routine.
Helo number 64 is designated Swim Two. If that helicopter is closer than Swim One to the landing point, swimmers will be deployed from Swim Two to attach the collar. Those swimmers are Lt J.G. Wesley T. Chesser of Arlington, Virginia; 3rd Class Petty Officer Michael G. Mallary of Alderwood Manor, Washington, and Seaman John M. Wolfram of Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin. The Helo's crew consists of pilot, Lt. Richard J. Barrett of Squannanoa [Swannanoa], North Carolina; copilot, Lt. George R. Conn, Imperial Beach, California. Crewmen are Petty Officer 2nd Class Curtis E. Hill, Black Rock, Arkansas, and Petty Officer 2nd Class Richard B. Seaton, Hibbing, Minnesota.
Apollo 11's distance now 5,411 nautical miles [10,021 km]. Velocity; 22,642 feet per second [6,901 m/s].
194:29:00 Evans: Apollo 11, Houston. Command Module RCS looks fine to us.
194:29:05 Collins: Same here, Ron. Looks very good. Doesn't make as much noise as we thought. Some of them are barely audible.
About now, 4 minutes after completing the horizon check, Mike has moved into the left hand seat to test the CM RCS with the hand-controller. Although the left seat is usually the CDR’s seat, it is normal for the CMP to occupy it at this point in an Apollo mission. He certainly sat here during the forthcoming re-entry, as recounted in his book "Liftoff: The Story of America’s Adventure in Space," Aurum Press, 1988, page 13: "Over in the left couch, I am watching my instruments like a hawk, ready to take over manually if I see something I don’t like." For the next 30 minutes or so he, rather than Neil, will make most of the important communications calls with Houston.
194:29:11 Evans: Roger.
194:29:16 Evans: And 11, Houston. The weather's still holding real fine in the recovery area.
194:29:22 Evans: Looks like it's about 1500 scattered, high scattered. And it's still 3- to 6-foot waves.
194:29:29 Collins: The air part of it sounds good.
194:29:33 Evans: Roger. [Long pause.]
194:30:00 Evans: 11, Houston, I'll give you another Mark at 33 minutes. Stand by.
194:30:07 Evans: Mark.
194:30:10 Collins: Roger that.

194:32:48 Evans: Roger. Well, the time is 36:41. And stand by for some settings.
194:32:59 Aldrin: Okay. I'll probably only be doing it maybe - part of it at six frames a second, some of it at one. So I can be changing settings as it goes through.
194:33:09 Evans: Roger. Copy. [Pause.]
194:33:19 Collins: And the horizon check passes. It's right on the money.

We're awaiting confirmation of separation.
Jettison of the Service Module occurs at 194:49:12.7 according to the Apollo 11 Mission Report.
The jettison of the Service Module will safely sever the CM-SM interface and ensure that the Service Module is moved away from the Command Module. This is done with great care because the SM has been their primary source of power, oxygen and cooling throughout the mission. Inadvertently separating the two modules would have had disastrous consequences for the crew. Orchestrated by the SECS (Sequential Event Control System), umbilical deadfacing, CM-SM separation, and SM evasive manoeuvring is performed in just a few seconds. For the highest reliability, a carefully timed series of pyrotechnic devices are employed.
Two highlighted and guarded switches for separation of the Command Module and Service Module on panel 2, as photographed in the cabin of Odyssey, the Apollo 13 CM.
The separation is initiated by flipping one of the CM-SM Sep switches on panel 2, just below the DSKY. In order to avoid accidental operation, these are protected by metal covers to avoid inadvertent operation. The SECS takes over at this point, immediately starting the process of deadfacing the electrical, gaseous and fluid connections between the Command and Service Modules.
A command is sent to the Service Module Jettison Controller located in the Service Module. Upon reception, the controller starts a timer that will trigger the RCS jets on the SM to move the now derelict hardware away from the CM. Many of the systems on board the SM are left active to perform the separation. The fuel cells in particular continue to operate, for if there is a problem or delay in the separation, the crew would not become dependent on the limited capacity of the re-entry batteries. Electrical power is also needed by the Service Module after separation to power the jettison controller and the RCS solenoids, and to fire the pyros needed to sever the tie-down connections holding the CM and SM together.
Prior to pyrotechnic cutting of the electrical connections using a guillotine, they are first unplugged. To allow for this, they terminate deep inside the CM as familiar cannon-style plug and socket connectors. As the separation sequence begins, a small pyrotechnic charge fires and the resulting gas is used to actuate a series of cams and levers to, quite literally, 'unplug' the SM electrical connections from the CM. Reflecting the one-shot nature of this permanent disconnection, the plugs and sockets are then locked in place to prevent any possibility of recontacting each other.
Once the electrical connections are deadfaced within the CM, the hinged cover protecting the cabling between the CM and SM pivots away so as not to interfere with the CM as it separates. Pyrotechnic charges fire again, propelling guillotine blades through the cable bundles and plumbing that run between the two modules. Now isolated from the Command Module, the Service Module event controller fires three sets of two pyros, each set which is attached to one of the three tension ties which hold the Command Module securely to the Service Module. The Command Module rests on six support pads, which distribute the weight of the CM across the heat shield. Three of these supports contain the tension ties which pass through the base of the heat shield and connect to the CM internal structure. Once the tension ties are severed, springs underneath each of the support pads push the two modules apart.
The final event occurs moments after the separation sequence is initiated. The minus-X thrusters simultaneously fire to move the Service Modules away from the Command Module. The SM roll thrusters also fire for 7.5 seconds to stabilize the SM as it moves away. The minus-X thrusters will continue firing until either the fuel depletes or the fuel cells give up.
We confirm separation now from on-the-ground readings, from telemetry. We can confirm separation.
194:50:42 Evans: Apollo 11, Houston. You're still looking mighty fine here. You're cleared for landing.
194:50:47 Collins: We appreciate that, Ron. Thank you.
194:50:49 Aldrin: Rog. Gear's down and locked.
194:50:52 Evans: Roger.

This quip about aircraft landing gear was made earlier by Apollo 7 Commander Wally Schirra as the glow of re-entry surrounded his Command Module.
Mike is discovering an effect of having the CM be cooled entirely by the evaporator (or boiler), now that the radiators have gone with the rest of the Service Module. The amount of cooling necessary means that a lot of water is being evaporated to lose the heat. This water leaves the CM as vapour via the steam vent which is below Buzz's window. The steam vent therefore acts as a weak thruster and since it is to the right as the crew look out, it imparts a motion to the left.
Collins, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "CM/SM Sep went normally. The water boiler was in operation during this period of time, which gave the spacecraft a left yaw. I was in Minimum Impulse a good percentage of this time, and thus it was quite noticeable. I yawed out 45 degrees left, jettisoned the Service Module, and yawed back in plane by yawing right. When I got a yaw rate started, the water boiler would fight me, the rate would reduce to near zero, and I would then have to make another input. Having gotten back to zero yaw after jettisoning the Service Module, I noticed there appeared to be something wrong with the yaw-left thruster at this time. It had worked normally for a little while, but after several minutes of operation, it did not. That was Command Module RCS thruster 16, yaw left. It appeared to be functioning improperly using the automatic coils. When you yawed left, it made some noise, but it did not give the proper response. It would work properly if you'd move the hand controller all the way over to the hard stops and use the direct coil. At this late stage of the game, I didn't want to devote any time to troubleshooting or talking about it. I probably should have brought the number 2 system on the line in that axis, but I didn't; and everything else seemed to be working normally. I'm just flagging that as a possible systems problem; somebody should look at that thruster and its associated wiring after the flight and see if there's anything wrong with it."

194:54:40 Aldrin: Houston, we got the Service Module going by. A little high and a little bit to the right.
194:54:49 Evans: Roger. Thank you.
194:54:53 Collins: And it's rotating just like it should be. Thrusters are firing.
194:55:00 Evans: Good. It's got a lot of gas there to burn out, too.

Given that the Service Module was jettisoned to the aft of the CM (an aft that is facing the direction of travel), it is interesting that it is now visible through what are roughly forward facing windows. Early Apollo missions (Apollo 7 through 12) revealed an unexpected problem with the method used to take the Service Module away from the Command Module. At first glance, firing the translational thrusters to back the SM away, and using the roll thrusters to stabilize it would seen to be a perfectly adequate solution for this manoeuvre. However, there was some surprise that the SM had somehow 'boomeranged' around and was tumbling alongside the Command Module. After extensive analysis engineers discovered that the residual fuel and oxidizer in the Service Module sump tanks acted as a sort of 'spring', taking the energy imparted onto them from the RCS jets, and releasing it against the tank walls as it sloshed about.
In a paper (Prediction of Apollo Service Module Motion after Jettison [J. Spacecraft and Rocket, June 1971]), a chart implies that any minus-X burn longer than about 200 seconds will result in the SM changing direction. Now, the direction reversal is not due simply to propellant sloshing. Because the SM's mass is not symmetrical over it's axis, any translational/rotational firing will start it tumbling. Since it is still tumbling while the minus-X thrusters are firing, eventually it orients itself to where the minus-X thrusters now have a posigrade (towards the CM) component. This, combined with the propellant slosh, was sufficient to cause the SM to reverse direction and head in the direction of the CM.

194:57:19 Evans: 11, Houston. You can go ahead and turn it on.
194:57:24 Aldrin: Okay. I'll have to go to Command Reset to do that.
194:57:34 Evans: 11, Houston. That's negative. All you have to do is turn it on. That'll be fine.

As Neil makes this utterance, Apollo 11 reaches Entry Interface, an arbitrary point where the flight path reaches an altitude of 400,000 feet or 121.92 metres. At this point, it makes an angle with the horizontal of 6.48°. At this time, the computer is in Program 63, holding their attitude and waiting for the accelerometers to indicate 0.05g.
Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "We gave spacecraft control over to the computer after we passed all our pitch attitude cross-checks. We gave it to the computer shortly before 400,000 feet. I don't recall exactly when, but a matter of seconds before 400,000 feet. We stayed in CMC, Auto for the rest of the entry. The computer did its usual brilliant job at steering. We just sort of peered over its shoulder and made sure that the spacecraft was responding to the bank angles that the computer commanded, and that those bank angles made sense in light of what we saw on the EMS and through other bits and pieces of information."
Nine minutes of radio silence from Apollo 11 now follow, as the spacecraft is surrounded by ionised gases created by the heat of re-entry. Mission Control starts calling them after 4 minutes.
We're at entry time. Blackout very shortly. Range to go to splash 1,533 nautical miles [2,839 km].
There's blackout.
The period of radio blackout was estimated to begin about 17 seconds after EI. It is caused by the spacecraft being surrounded by a sheath of ionised gas. The conducting properties of this plasma cause it to attenuate the radio communications to and from the spacecraft.
Buzz films the re-entry through the right-hand rendezvous window with the 16-mm camera looking through a mirror. This version of that film has been flipped to restore the correct geometry. It is presented at 24 frames per second despite the fact that it was shot at either 6 or 12 frames per second. Therefore, the action in the film appears speeded up.
H.264 MOV video file.
At about 195:03:34, a deceleration of 0.05g is sensed and the entry proper begins. Two major events are triggered. First, the EMS begins to operate, decrementing its velocity counter and its range-to-go counter while also operating a scribe across a Mylar tape that carries a pattern. This tape moves according to the change in velocity, and the scribe moves up and down according to the g-force. Second, the computer moves to P64.
Program 64's task is to get the spacecraft below the velocity that would be required for a circular orbit, VCIRC. The program no longer holds the spacecraft's attitude because the spacecraft's natural aerodynamic stability will do so. Instead, it fires the pitch and yaw thrusters as necessary to damp out oscillations in those axes. P64 achieves its major task by repeatedly testing their flight path to see if VCIRC had been achieved, and it ramps the g-forces up beyond 6 g as it does so.
Collins, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "Along about .05 g, we started to get all these colors past the windows; Buzz took some movies, which we looked at last night. They don't really show what the human eye sees. Around the edge of the plasma sheath, there are all varieties of colors - lavenders, lightish bluish greens, little touches of violet, and great variations mostly of blues and greens. The central core has variations on a orange-yellow theme. It's sort of a combination of all the colors of the rainbow really. The central part looks like you would imagine a burning material might look. Orangeish, yellowish, whitish, and then completely surrounded by almost a rainbow of colors."
Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "I thought there was a surprisingly small amount of material coming off."
Collins, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "That's right; there didn't seem to be any chunks as there were on Gemini."
Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "That's right; there didn't seem to be any droplets or anything coming off. There was a small number of sparks going by; you could definitely see the flow pattern. Looking out the side window, you could get a very good indication of the angle of attack by the direction of motion of the particles. That didn't seem to change too much. When a thruster would fire, you could pick it up immediately, because it deflected the ion stream behind you. I am not sure whether that was because of a roll or whether it was actually changing the direction of the lift vector."

195:03:36 - This blackout period should last for about 3 minutes, 45 seconds. At blackout we were showing velocity; 36,237 feet per second [11,045 m/s]. Range to go to splash; 1,510 nautical miles [2,797 km].
195:04:10 - The elapsed time for end of blackout; 195 hours, 7 minutes even.
195:04:42 - Drogue chute deployment time is 195 hours, 12 minutes, 8 seconds.
195:04:58 - And the Control Center will not attempt to communicate with Apollo 11 after drogue deploy time. It'll leave the airwaves clear for the recovery forces.
At about 195:05:19, the CM's velocity goes below VCIRC. Even if it were to fly out of the atmosphere completely, using its lift vector, it cannot go into orbit and is committed to an Earth landing.
Once VCIRC had been reached, the computer moves to Program 65 (Up control) where it aims the lift vector up to perform a small skip-out in order to extend the range. The peak of this skip is not high enough to invoke P66, a program that controls the spacecraft while it is outside the atmosphere during a skip. Instead, P65 hands over to P67 to control the final phase of the flown re-entry.
P67's task is to bring the CM to a point essentially above the landing site. It will do so up to the point when their Earth-based velocity is about 300 metres per second [1,000 feet per second]. Their altitude will then be about 20 km or 65,000 feet.
Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "The computer did not fly the EMS the same way I would have flown the EMS. As soon as it got subcircular, it seemed to store up a lot more excess energy than I thought was reasonable. It was holding on to an approximate 250 [nautical] miles [460 km] downrange error. When the downrange distance to go was, say, 500 [nautical] miles, it would have about 750 [nautical] miles available at that particular g level we were seeing at the time. I thought this was probably a little excessive, but it hung on until very, very late in the game and then it decided all of a sudden to dump it. It sort of rolled over on its back and gave us a second peak pulse of 6 g's, getting rid of that excess energy. After that, everything was all cross-ranges and downranges, and everything made sense. It was essentially on zero error for the remainder of the run. Our first peak pulse was 6.5 [g] as nearly as you can read that thing, and the second one was 6.0."
195:06:03 - ARIA 3 reported a visual contact.
195:06:26 - We're at 3 minutes, 20 seconds since entry. Blackout should end about 3 minutes, 53 seconds after entry.
Blackout is predicted to end at about 195:06:57. Meanwhile, P67 continues to steer the spacecraft. If the spacecraft is going to land long, it is rolled around to a feet-down attitude. This puts the lift vector down and has the spacecraft dig into the thicker parts of the atmosphere to increase the deceleration and shorten the flight path. Conversely, if the computer thinks it is going to come up short, it put the lift vector up in order to stay in the thinner region of the atmosphere, reducing the rate of deceleration and lengthening the flight path. There is also scope to adjust for errors left and right, what Neil calls crossrange, by rolling up to 15 degrees to the side and using the left vector to correct the error.
195:06:59 - We're about 11 minutes away from landing.

What Evans refers to as the miss distance is the range to go to the landing point.
They are about 20 km up (65,000 feet) and plummeting almost vertically at 300 metres per second. At about this time, the Cabin Pressure Relief Valve is set to Entry. With this setting, once the outside pressure is greater than the cabin, Earth's air can flow into the spacecraft. The Sequential Events Control System is armed, ready to coordinate the pyrotechnics of the Earth Landing System.
195:12:04 Evans: Apollo 11, Houston. Standing by for your DSKY reading. Over. [No answer.]
Before the drogue chutes can be released, the forward heatshield has to be jettisoned. Also known as the apex cover or the ring (as described by Aldrin below), this exposed all the main devices for the landing; drogue and main parachutes, recovery antennae and the uprighting bags. The trigger for jettisoning the apex cover is a barometric switch that senses the rising air pressure. Once released, a small parachute helps to pull it away from the CM.
Still frames from 16-mm coverage of the apex cover being jettisoned on Apollo 15 and Apollo 17.
The mortars to deploy the drogues are fired 1.6 seconds later and according to the Mission Report, the drogues were deployed at 195:12:06.9, about a second earlier than predicted in the Entry PAD. By this time, the spacecraft's speed has dropped to about 150 metres per second.
195:12:09 Evans: Drogues. [Long pause.]
Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "I could see the ring departing just a fraction of a second before I felt a small pulse. There wasn't much of a rotation as the drogue chutes deployed. They seemed too oscillate around a good bit, but did not transmit much of this oscillation to the spacecraft. The spacecraft seemed to stay on a pretty steady course."
195:12:22 Evans: Apollo 11, Houston. Your DSKY reading, please. Over.
195:12:31 Armstrong: Roger. We were aiming right on 13, 32 and 169, 17. [Long pause.]
Neil is reading out their position, 13.32° North and 167.17° West.
195:12:48 - Apollo 11 reports right on. We take that to mean that the drogues deployed on time.
195:12:53 Armstrong: Reading 13, 30; 169, 15.
Comm break.
195:13:22 - Apollo 11 should be on main chutes now.
The main parachutes are deployed at about 3 km (10,000 feet) altitude again, triggered by another barometric switch. For the first 10 seconds after deployment, they are reefed which means that a reefing line around the parachute risers prevents the canopies from fully inflating to their 25-metre diameter. After the 10 seconds has passed, the reefing line is cut and the chutes are allowed to fully inflate. The main parachutes bring their speed down to just 8.5 metres per second.
Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "The main chute deployment again gave us a small jolt, but not one that would move you around in the seat appreciably or cause any concern. I can't say that I noticed the difference between first deployment and dereefing. It seemed to be one continuous operation."
Collins, from the 1969 Technical debrief: "It seemed to me there was quite a bit of delay before they dereefed. All three chutes were stable and all dereefed and they kept staying that way until I was just about the point where I was getting worried about whether they were ever going to dereef; then they did."
195:13:35 - Hornet reports a sonic boom a short time ago.
195:14:08 - We're just under 4 minutes to landing.
We will continue to monitor for any conversation between the spacecraft and recovery forces, but we will not initiate a call from now on to the spacecraft from the Control Center.
From now on, the conversation with the crew is picked up by the USS Hornet and the helicopter crews who are in the air, ready to effect a recovery.

Spacecraft: [Garble] splashdown. [Long pause.]
In the movie "In the Shadow of the Moon" (2006), Mike Collins recalled: "I can remember the beautiful water. We were out in the deep ocean in the Pacific. It was such a startling violet color. I remember looking at the ocean and admiring: 'nice ocean you've got here planet Earth'."

Swim 1: This is Swim 1. The Command Module is at stable 2, stable 2. Over.
The Apollo Command Module has two possible stable attitudes when floating in the water. Stable 1 is fully upright and Stable 2 has the apex at water level, not quite upside down. This is how the Apollo 11 CM has ended up.
Helicopter 53, designated Swim 1, hovers over the inverted Command Module soon after splashdown. One of the main parachutes is visible still on the surface. Two of the uprighting bags are visible around the apex. When inverted, the heavy side of the spacecraft goes downward leaving the hatch facing up. The crew are upright but hanging forward in their harnesses at about 45°.

Swim 2: This is Swim 2. [Garble].
Hornet: Hornet, Roger.
The elevator will take Recovery 1 down to the hangar deck and where the crew will enter the Mobile Quarantine Facility. And the flags are waving and the cigars are being lit up. And clear across the big board in front is President John F. Kennedy's message to Congress of May, 1961: I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth. That has been accomplished.
Swim 2: This is Swim 2. The sea anchor is holding the Command Module very well. It's extremely stable.
The Apollo 11 plaque has been hung in the Mission Control Center - a replica of the crew patch.

This Control Center becoming jammed with people as - people from the staff support rooms coming in here. We've never seen this many people in the Control Center at one time before.
Speaker: President Nixon waving to the astronauts. The curtains have been drawn. There they are in the rear window. President is receiving applause from the crowd. Astronauts gather in the window.
Television pictures show President Richard M. Nixon approaching the Mobile Quarantine Facility on the hangar deck of the USS Hornet, where he has been waiting to greet the astronauts. The crew, now without their Biological Isolation Garments and masks, appear at the window of the cabin, as a curtain is opened. They speak with the President by microphone.
Nixon: Neil, Buzz, and Mike. I want you to know that I think I'm the luckiest man in the world. And I say this not only because I have the honor to be President of the United States, but particularly because I have the privilege of speaking for so many in welcoming you back to Earth. I could tell you about all the messages we received in Washington. Over one hundred foreign governments, Emperors, and Presidents and Prime Ministers and Kings have sent the most warm messages that we've ever received. They represent over 2 billion people on this Earth. All of them who have had the opportunity through television to see what you have done. And then I also bring you messages from members of the Cabinet and members of the Senate and members of the House and the Space Agency. And in the streets of San Francisco where people stopped me a few days ago, and you all love that city, I know, as I do. But most important, I had a telephone call yesterday. The toll wasn't, incidentally, as great as the one I made to you fellows on the Moon. [Laughter] I made that collect, incidentally, in case you didn't know. But I called the three of, in my view, three of the greatest ladies and most courageous ladies in the whole world today, your wives. And from Jan and Joan and Pat, I bring their love and their congratulations. We think it's just wonderful that they could have participated, at least through television, in this return; we're only sorry they couldn't be here. And also, I've got to let you in on a little secret - I made a date with them. [Laughter] I invited them to dinner on the 13th of August, right after you come out of quarantine. It will be a state dinner held in Los Angeles. The governors of all the fifty States will be there, the ambassadors, others from around the world and in America. And they told me that you would come too. And all I want to know - will you come? We want to honor you then.
Armstrong: We'll do anything you say, Mr. President. Just anything.
President Richard Nixon recalls the recovery of Apollo 11 in his memoirs: "Because the mission's command module was named 'Columbia', I had asked the Navy band to play 'Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean' as the astronauts stepped from the helicopter onto the aircraft carrier Hornet's [italics] deck.
"When I talked with them through the window of their quarantine chamber, it was hard to contain my enthusiasm or my awe at the thought that the three men on the other side of that glass had just returned from the moon. I said impulsively, 'This is the greatest week in the history of the world since the Creation.' When I talked to Billy Graham a few days later, he said, 'Mr. President, I know exactly how you felt, and I understand exactly what you meant, but, even so, I think you may have been a little excessive.'" 'The Memoirs of Richard Nixon,' Arrow Books (Hutchinson Publishing Group), 1978, pages 429-430.
Nixon: One question, I think, all of us would like to ask. As we saw you bouncing around in that boat out there, I wonder if that wasn't the hardest part of the journey. Was that the only - Did any of you get seasick?
Armstrong: No, we didn't. And it was one of the harder parts, but it was one of the most pleasant, we can assure you.
Nixon: Yes, well, I just know that you can sense what we all sense. When you get back now - incidentally, have you been able to follow some of the things that happened when you've gone. Did you know about the All-Star game?
Armstrong: Yes, sir. The Capsule Communicators have been giving us daily news reports.
Collins: They keep you posted.
Nixon: Were you American League or National League?
Armstrong: I'm a National League man.
Aldrin: I'm non-partisan, sir.
Collins: That's right.
Nixon: There's the politician in the group, right.
Armstrong: We're sorry you missed that game.
Nixon: Yes, well - you knew that too.
Armstrong: We heard that...
Nixon: The rain...
Armstrong: The rain. Well, we haven't been able to control the weather yet, but that's something we can look forward to as tomorrow's challenge.
Nixon: Right, right. Well, I can only summarize it because I don't want to hold you now. You have so much more to do. And gee, you look great - do you feel as good as you look?
Armstrong: Oh, we feel just perfectly, Mr. President.
Nixon: Yeah, I understand your - Frank Borman says you're a little younger by reason of having going [sic] into space, is that right. Do you feel that way, a little younger?
Collins: We're a lot younger than Frank Borman, sir. [Laughter].
Nixon: There he is, over there. Come on over Frank, so they can see you. You going to take that lying down?
Frank Borman, commander of Apollo 8 whose crew were the first humans to orbit the Moon seven months earlier, had been assigned by NASA as adviser to the President during key moments of the mission. They had watched the moonwalk live together in the private office of the White House, before the President’s televised telephone call to the astronauts from the adjacent Oval Office. "The Memoirs of Richard Nixon," Arrow Books (Hutchinson Publishing Group), 1978, page 429.
Aldrin: It looks like he has aged in the last couple of days .
Nixon: Come on, Frank.
Borman: Mr. President, the one thing I wanted. You know we have a poet in Mike Collins and he really gave me a hard time for describing new words of fantastic and beautiful. And you were - I counted them, in three minutes up there you used four fantastics and two beautifuls. (Laughter).
Nixon: Well, just let me close off with this one thing. I was thinking as you know, as you came down and we knew it was a success, and it had only been eight days, just a week, a long week. But this is the greatest week in the history of the world since the creation. Because as a result of what happened in this week, the world is bigger infinitely. And also, as I'm going to find on this trip around the world, and as Secretary Rogers will find as he covers the other countries and Asia, as a result of what you've done the world's never been closer together before. And we just thank you for that. And I only hope that all of us in government, all of us in America, that as a result of what you've done, we can do our job a little better. We can reach for the stars, just as you have reached so far for the stars. We don't want to hold you any longer. Anybody have a last re... How about promotions, do you think we could arrange something? (Laughter)
Armstrong: We're just pleased to be back and very honored that you were so kind as to come out here and welcome us back, and we look forward to getting out of this quarantine...
Collins: Great.
Armstrong: ...and talking without having glass between us.
Nixon: And incidentally, the speeches that you have to make at this dinner can be very short. And if you want to say fantastic or beautiful, that's all right with us. Don't try to think of any new adjectives; they've all been said. And now, I think incidentally, that all of us who - the millions that are seeing us on television now, are seeing you, would feel as I do that in a sense our prayers have been answered, and I think it would be very appropriate if Chaplain Piirto, the Chaplain of this ship were to offer a prayer of thanksgiving. If he would step up now. Chaplain, thank you.
Lt. Comdr. John A. Piirto, USN Chaplain: Let us pray. Lord, God, our Heavenly Father. Our minds are staggered and our spirit exultant with the magnitude and precision of this entire Apollo 11 mission. We have spent the past week in communal anxiety and hope as our astronauts sped through the glories and dangers of the heavens. As we try to understand and analyze the scope of this achievement for human life, our reason is overwhelmed with abounding gratitude and joy, even as we realize the increasing challenges of the future. This magnificent event illustrates anew what man can accomplish when purpose is firm and intent corporate. A man on the Moon was promised in this decade. And, though some were unconvinced, the reality is with us this morning, in the persons of astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins. We applaud their splendid exploits and we pour out our thanksgiving for their safe return to us, to their families, to all mankind. From our inmost beings, we sing humble, yet exuberant praise. May the great effort and commitment seen in this project, Apollo, inspire our lives to move similarly in other areas of need. May we the people by our enthusiasm and devotion and insight move to new landings in brotherhood, human concern, and mutual respect. May our country, afire with inventive leadership and backed by a committed followership, blaze new trails into all areas of human cares. See our enthusiasm and bless our joy with dedicated purpose for the many needs at hand. Link us in friendship with peoples throughout the world as we strive together to better the human condition. Grant us peace, beginning in our own hearts, and a mind attuned with good will towards our neighbor. All this we pray as our thanksgiving rings out to Thee. In the name of our Lord, amen.
Collins: Amen.
National anthem plays.
Speaker: The astronauts stood to attention.
This is Apollo Control. The participants in the post-recovery news conference have left the Control Center, and the post-recovery news conference will begin within the next few minutes in the MSC building 1 auditorium.
This concludes the Apollo 11 Flight Journal.
