This is Apollo Control at 31 hours, 34 minutes. Things have settled down into a rather quiet routine here in Mission Control and we presume aboard the spacecraft. At this time the Apollo 16 crew should be eating what would be lunch for them. Following that they will begin preparation for the transfer to the Lunar Module, the second of this flight; of course the first coming last night, an unscheduled entry. And during this scheduled entry this evening, Duke and Young will be powering up the communications and instrumentation systems aboard the Lunar Module. We'll check out the communications circuits with them and also give the Control Center here a chance to look at all of the major systems on the Lunar Module once the instrumentation to all of these systems is powered up. Normally, during the translunar leg of the flight, the only instrumentation, the only readings that we have on the LM is the amount of power that is transferred from the Command Module to the Lunar Module, and during this entry into the LM, Duke and Young will be powering up the bulk of the instrumentation that will allow us to look at all critical systems. They'll also be transferring most of the items from the Command Module that they'll need for operations in the Lunar Module later in the mission and stowing these in the LM.

031:53:11 Young: Okay, Houston. We're up to 2.1 on the LM/CM Delta-P gauge now.
031:53:16 Peterson: Roger. Copy 2.1. [Pause.] And while I'm talking to you on this oxygen-tank pressure gauge, it's starting to look like there's a bias in there of about 14.7 [psi - 101 kilopascals] due to the fact that the reference chamber has apparently leaked its 1 atmosphere reference value down to probably vacuum. And that, coupled with a 5-psi [35 kilopascals] meter bias, should give you a total bias of about 20 psi [138 kilopascals] on the oxygen-tank pressure. But the gauge seems to be working okay except for that bias, so we're going to continue to follow it so we can give you a - maybe a better number prior to LOI. [Long pause.]
031:54:08 Young: Thank you, Pete.
031:54:10 Peterson: Roger. [Long pause.]
031:54:27 Duke: Houston, 16. Over.
031:54:29 Peterson: Go ahead.
031:54:32 Duke: Okay, Pete. I just took my window shade out of my rendezvous window and, looking out at Quad 1 of old Orion, the thermal shield that sits directly inboard of the - the - of the - of the quad - it's facing the plus-Z direction. It's a little piece about three feet long by about a foot wide [0.3 by 0.9 metres]; it's beginning to peel off also, now. Over.
031:55:02 Peterson: It's doing the same thing as the - as the panel we were - we looked at last night, huh?
031:55:08 Duke: That's affirm, except for - It - it's not nearly as bad, and it's just primarily on the inboard side, but it is beginning to get the shredded wheat appearance like the other one. Over.
031:55:16 Peterson: Roger. Understand. [Long pause.]
031:55:28 Duke: Pete, on the outboard side [clears throat] right out near the quad - or right above the quad - on that same panel, it - it seems to me it's beginning - it looks like it starts out with a very fine, shaggy-grass-type stuff, and then slowly peels up into the shredded-wheat type. Over.
031:56:13 Peterson: Roger. Understand.
Long comm break.

032:03:06 Peterson: 16, Houston. When you get a minute, we've got a - an addition to the Flight Plan at 32:48. [Long pause.]
032:03:36 Young: Roger. Go ahead with your 32:48 addition.
032:03:40 Peterson: Okay. We want to add a note to read the LM/CM Delta-P. [Pause.]
032:03:52 Peterson: And we want to get that prior to that CM/LM pressure equalization decal. [Pause.]
032:04:06 Young: Okey dokey. [Pause.]
032:04:17 Peterson: And, Ken, that - we've made an ink correction on the back of that AOS/LOS Sun-wheel aid there. When you getting around to digging that out, I can give it to you, or I can pick it up later. [Pause.]
032:04:37 Young: Ken's busy right now. Say again. Over.
032:04:40 Peterson: Okay, on the back of the Sun wheel - the AOS/LOS Sun wheel - we've entered an ink note to account for the fact that we change REFSSMAT in the middle of his work there. We made an error on it. We've got to change the note now, and sometime when he's got that wheel out, I can read him up the correction.
032:05:00 Young: Okay.

This is Apollo Control at 32 hours, 5 minutes. A few minutes ago, Charlie Duke reported additional paint apparently peeling from another of the aluminum skins on the Lunar Module, and from Duke's description this appeared to be one of the surfaces in the area of Quad 1 on the Lunar Module. This would be the quad adjacent to the Commander's station in the crew compartment. And Duke said that there were about three square feet of surface area involved. He described the appearance of the surface about as the other surface which had also peeled. Ranging from what he said was a kind of a sprouting grass appearance to shredded wheat. And at the present time, the crew is awaiting the pressure differential between the docking tunnel and the Command Module to reach 2.7 lbs per sq. inch [18.6 kilopascals]. At the last report from John Young, the difference in pressure as the tunnel is vented, had reached 2.1 lbs per sq. inch [14.5 kilopascals]. The crew is scheduled to begin entering the Lunar Module to power up the communication system and turn on the instrumentation so that we can get a complete look at most of the major systems on the Lunar Module here on the ground through telemetry. And the Flight Plan calls for them to enter the Lunar Module at about 33 hours, 5 minutes; or a little less than one hour from now. At the present time, Apollo 16 is 123,126 nautical miles [228,029 km] from Earth, and traveling at a speed of 4,382 feet per second [1,336 m/s].

This is Apollo Control at 32 hours, 26 minutes. Here in the Control Center the Lunar Module Control officer has replayed the tape of Charlie Duke's description of the additional surface of the LM that appeared to be peeling - where the paint was peeling, similar to the way panels below the docking target were reported peeling yesterday. From Duke's description, we were not able to pin point the precise panels involved although it is obviously very close to the area that was reported peeling previously, and appeared much the same from Duke's description. The paint which is painted on the very thin aluminum skin in this area of the LM to provide a small margin of additional thermal protection in worse case conditions where the Lunar Module is exposed to greater sun angles than we will be seeing on this mission, the paint on those surfaces is, as Duke described them, giving the appearance of sprouting grass and then peeling back even further and giving an appearance of shredded wheat. Duke said that the area involved was about 1 feet by - 1 foot by 3 feet [0.3 by 0.9 metres]. And was in the area of Quad 1, which is one of the Reaction Control Systems thruster quads located adjacent to the commander's station in the Lunar Module ascent stage. General Jim McDivitt, who is in the Control Center at the present time, advised Pete Frank that the studies that Grumman has done, the manufacturer of the Lunar Module, show that even if all of the surfaces on the LM which are painted in this manner were to lose their paint, that the effect would be minimal and would cause no concern as far the temperatures of the Lunar Module are concerned. We expect that we will get further information at the time the crew enters the Lunar Module and also we will be looking at all of the pertinent systems; all of the critical systems aboard the Lunar Module and are getting a comparative set of numbers to go with those that we saw last night. And all of the engineers here in the Control Center and the back rooms, the staff support rooms, and in Building 45 at the Manned Spacecraft Center will be looking at this data very closely and comparing it with the information that we got when the LM was powered up last night.

032:43:00 Young: Okay, Houston, we got 2.7 [psi] on the tunnel vent right now.
032:43:05 Peterson: Roger; copy 2.7...
032:43:06 Young: I mean CM Delta-P.
032:43:08 Peterson: Roger; LM/CM Delta-P...
032:43:09 Young: On the LM/CM Delta-P. [Pause.]
032:43:16 Peterson: Okay, we copy. [Long pause.]
032:43:46 Unknown speaker: [Garble.] [Long pause.]
032:44:03 Young: Okay, Houston, we're going to come on with the direct O2 and pump up the cabin.

032:48:12 Young: How does that look, Houston? Is that about 5.7 [psi - 39.3 kilopascals] to you?
032:48:19 Peterson: We're showing about 5.5, John.
032:48:23 Young: Okay. [Pause.]
032:48:28 Peterson: John, they say that's good enough now.
032:48:33 Young: Okay, Direct O2 is going Closed.
032:48:37 Peterson: Roger. [Long pause.]
032:48:54 Young: And the LM/CM Delta-P is 3.3.

032:52:00 Peterson: 16, we want to continue LM venting until you have a reading - Delta-P reading of 3.4 [psi - 23 kilopascals] on the meter, and that should take less than ten minutes. [Pause.]
032:52:17 Duke: Okay, we copy. We'll go to 3.4. [Long pause.]

032:57:15 Young: Are we cleared to proceed? Over.
032:57:18 Peterson: Rog, clear.

This is Apollo Control at 32 hours, 58 minutes. The LM cabin has now been vented down to the desire - desired pressure level and the crew will shortly begin repressurizing the cabin to about 5 to 5½ pounds per square inch. Following that, they will be preparing to enter the Lunar Module. I expect that will require about five to ten minutes. The Flight Plan calls for them to be in the LM by about 33 hours and five minutes or about seven or eight minutes from now. They will have to remove the tunnel hatch, the probe and drogue assembly, and then crawl through the tunnel into the Lunar Module. Following that they have about 30 minutes or so of housekeeping activities aboard the LM and then they'll activate the communications systems and run a series of communications checks with Mission Control. Our LM systems engineer has just reported that they are beginning the activities toward repressurizing the Lunar Module. During this entry into the LM, they'll also be powering up the data systems that will allow us to get a good look at all of the major systems on the Lunar Module through the telemetry and we'll have teams of engineers here in Mission Control and in the engineering support rooms in Building 45 here at the Manned Spacecraft Center looking at this data very closely and comparing it with the similar measurements that we got yesterday when the crew made their unscheduled, previously unscheduled entry into the LM. At the present time Apollo 16 is 125,324 nautical miles [232,100 km] from Earth and we're continuing to watch the spacecraft velocity drop off. It is down to 4,310 feet per second [1,313 m/s].

033:14:13 Young: [Faint.] Charlie's floating on over there now.
033:14:16 Young: Houston, Charlie's floating on over to the Lunar Module now - to check on old Orion.
033:14:24 Peterson: Okay.
Comm break.
That was John Young reporting Charlie Duke, as he put it, "floating over to the Lunar Module now." That report came at 33 hours, 14 minutes, and we expect that Young will be following shortly.
033:15:41 Young: Houston, that docking tunnel index, minus 3.5.
033:15:46 Peterson: Minus 3.5.

This is Apollo Control. We're awaiting the first bits of data from the Lunar Module as Young and Duke begin partially powering the vehicle up. The Flight Dynamics Officer just reported that, as a result of the midcourse correction performed at 30 hours, 39 minutes, the spacecraft appears to be on the desired trajectory and will be approaching the Moon at an altitude of about 71 nautical miles [131 kilometres] at its closest point prior to the Lunar Orbit Insertion maneuver. This is the preplanned value. We also have an update on the predicted impact point for the Saturn third stage, the S-IVB. The new coordinates that we now have for that impact point are 1 degree, 50 minutes north and 23 degrees, 18 minutes west. This is slightly closer to the planned target point of 30 degrees west than the coordinates we got last night. As I recall those had us about 22½ west; we're now showing about 23 degrees, 18 minutes west so moving a little bit more westerly as we continue to get additional tracking on the S-IVB. And the expected impact time is 75 hours, 7 minutes, 3 seconds Ground Elapsed Time.
033:24:19 Mattingly: Houston, Casper.
033:24:22 Peterson: Go ahead, Casper.
033:24:26 Mattingly: Rog, Don. Did you guys get the tunnel index? [Pause.]
033:24:33 Peterson: We've got it, Ken.
033:24:37 Mattingly: Okay. [Pause.]
033:24:48 Mattingly: And, Don, I'm holding off on the oxygen heaters. I'm keeping them all three in Auto until we get the surge and repress tanks built back up. That okay? If you would like for me to turn them off, I can reconfigure now; otherwise, I would like you to help me remember not to leave them on.
033:25:08 Peterson: Roger, we concur, Ken. [Pause.] We'll remind you.
033:25:17 Mattingly: Okay, thank you.

This is Apollo Control, at 33 hours, 47 minutes. We've heard nothing from John Young and Charlie Duke, since Young reported about 30 minutes ago that they were entering the Lunar Module Orion. The crew is scheduled to be stowing items that they've carried over from the Command Module and then we'll begin powering up the Lunar Module, according to checklists that they will be carrying on with them. And shortly after they begin the partial power up, we should see telemetry data of most of the critical systems aboard the Lunar Module.

033:53:57 Mattingly: Hey, Don, can I talk to you about the docking latch?
033:54:03 Peterson: Roger. [Pause.]
033:54:08 Mattingly: You all set, or do you want me to wait a minute?
033:54:10 Peterson: No, go ahead.
033:54:13 Mattingly: Okay, you remember we told you at the time we - that we docked that we had a Number 10 [latch] that didn't look like it had stroked quite the same as the others; but the lock was over the - over the rail.
033:54:27 Peterson: Right.
033:54:28 Mattingly: You weren't on board at the time, that's right, we were talking to Gordy...
033:54:30 Peterson: Right.
033:54:31 Mattingly: But that's one of the things we reported and the plate that goes over the bungee fairing is cocked slightly. And now that we've got everything cleaned out of the tunnel, I can look in here. It's real obvious that the bungee hasn't fired completely. It's down; the top of the bungee is recessed about a half of an inch down. It looks like it just hadn't triggered and, as a matter of fact, I'm looking at the latch and, by golly, I can see between the latch and the total ring, so it didn't even pull down against that. And I really obviously don't have any concern for it; except I'm - I've never seen one that looked just like this and I was gonna go ahead and recock it and fire it again and see how that worked with a manual trigger. But I got to thinking maybe that's - maybe it's best to let you folks think about it. The main thing I want to do is make sure it's not a problem in unlatching it when the time comes.
033:55:36 Peterson: Roger; stand by.
Comm break.
033:56:57 Peterson: Casper, we capt - we got all the data we need and we're going to take a look at it. We do not want you to recock and fire the thing manually and we'll get back to you later.
033:57:06 Mattingly: Okay.

033:58:31 Mattingly: And, Houston, Casper turned over the power supply to Orion at 33:58. [Pause.]
033:58:43 Peterson: Roger, Casper.
Long comm break.
With Ken Mattingly's report that he'd turned over power to the LM; which came at 33 hours, 58 minutes; we would expect shortly to begin seeing telemetry data from the Lunar Module. Also Mattingly commented on a problem that had been reported previously and that is that one of the 12 docking latches on the Command Module apparently had not latched firmly around the docking ring of the Lunar Module, as would normally be expected. This doesn't constitute any concern; three of these 12 docking latches are adequate to assure a hard dock, and only one of the 12 is not latched down firmly. The belief at the present time is that it's probably just hung up if the thing were fired again that it would engage fully. And it doesn't appear that anything further will be done with this particular latch. The expectation is that when the two vehicles are separated and then docked again, that the latch will perform properly. And as we mentioned, in any event, only three of the 12 latches are required for a hard docking. We have now started getting LM data, so we'll be taking a good look at all of the systems on the Lunar Module.
034:02:02 Mattingly: Orion, how do you read Casper on VHF Alpha?
034:02:04 Young: Man, you're just super on VHF Alpha. How me?
034:02:08 Mattingly: Man, that's good stuff, isn't it?
034:02:11 Young: Just beautiful.
Timings differ in next section between the CM and technical tape transcriptions.

034:04:11 Duke (onboard): Okay. Do you want to - we can - we're down to step - 5 on page 1-118 - 1-18. Do you want to look at the bit rates some more?
034:04:33 Peterson: Negative. We don't want to look at it anymore.
034:04:38 Duke: You do not. Rog. We're going to Low Bit Rate. [Pause.] Okay, the book says "Perform voice and low bit rate check with MSFN." How do you read?
034:04:52 Peterson: Loud and clear.
034:04:55 Duke: Same-o. [Long pause.]
034:05:06 Duke (onboard): Okay, Houston. Our Function - S-Band Function is in Voice now. How do you read?

034:08:09 Peterson: Stand by 1, Orion. [Long pause.]
034:08:24 Peterson: Okay, Orion. You can deactivate.
034:08:29 Duke: Okay, deactivating.

Our LM controllers here in the Control Center report that all of the LM systems look good based on the telemetry data that we're receiving. Apollo 16 at this time is 128,138 nautical miles [237,313 km] from Earth traveling at a speed of 4,221 feet per second [1,287 m/s]. And Charlie Duke reported that he and Young are now ready to begin deactivating the Lunar Module in preparation for going back into the Command Module and closing up the hatch.

This is Apollo Control at 34 hours, 35 minutes. John Young and Charlie Duke are apparently still in the Lunar Module, Orion. They're not scheduled to complete the close out and return to the Command Module for another 25 or 30 minutes. During the time that they had the LM partially powered up and we had telemetry data, all of the systems onboard looked normal, everything looked very good.

034:43:20 Peterson: Casper, we've got the LOI-minus-5 flyby PAD whenever you're ready to copy.
034:43:28 Duke: Stand by one.
034:43:30 Peterson: Roger.
034:43:36 Duke: We got Casper's keeper over in the Lunar Module taking a peek, and we'll be closing it out and we'll get it in a minute.
034:43:42 Peterson: Rog. Understand.

034:47:44 Duke: Pete, you - really get to be a real believer in the heating capacity of the Sun. In the Lunar Module here, the commander's window is in direct sunlight, and it's almost too hot to touch it. My window's in the shade, and it's got fro - it's frosted over.
034:48:01 Peterson: Roger. [Pause.]
034:48:08 Duke: Okay; we gonna close her out, Pete.
034:48:10 Peterson: Okay, Charlie.
Long comm break.
That was Charlie Duke reporting. He and John Young are going to close out the Lunar Module now, and get back in the Command Module. Duke also gave one observation of the effects of the Sun on heating the vehicle. He reported that the commander's window, which was in direct sunlight, was almost too hot to touch, and the Lunar Module Pilot's window on the other side of the vehicle was frosted over. That window, of course, not in the sunlight. And at this time Apollo 16 is 129,776 nautical miles [240,345 km] from Earth. The speed down now to 4,170 feet per second [1,271 m/s].

035:03:53 Young: Houston, the hatch is closed; the drogue is installed; the probe's installed; the hatch is installed on our side; the LM Tunnel Vent valve is in LM/CM Delta-P; the tunnel lights are off. Is it okay if we go to PTC; set up PTC now, or do y'all want to wait until 34?
[Music in background.]
035:04:22 Peterson: Stand by one. [Long pause.]
035:04:37 Peterson: 16, you can go ahead and do the PTC.
035:04:42 Young: Okay.
Comm break.
That was John Young reporting the probe and drogue assembly reinstalled in the LM tunnel, the hatch back in place, and a bit of what sounded like blue grass banjo music drifting in from the background. Apparently the music being played on the crew's onboard tape recorder. That report that Young and Duke had completed their activities aboard the Lunar Module and we're back in the Command Module with everything in the LM buttoned up. It came at about 35 hours, 5 minutes. We got the report at 33 hours, 14 minutes that Charlie Duke had entered the Lunar Module so...
035:06:04 Peterson: 16, in addition to the LOI flyby PAD, we've got some cryo tank configuration changes for you. [Pause.]
035:06:19 Young: Okay. If you can hold up for a second on that.
[Music in background.]
035:06:21 Peterson: Roger.
Comm break.
The total time that Young and Duke were in the Lunar Module Orion was about 1 hour, 45 to 1 hour, 50 minutes and we don't have a precise time on their reentry to the Command Module, but that would be a fairly good estimate.
035:08:36 Young: Hey, Houston; 16. You can go ahead with the cryo tank reconfiguration.
035:08:41 Peterson: Okay. On the cryo tanks, we want H2 Tanks 1 and 2 Heaters, Auto; and Tank 3 Fan, Off. Oxygen Tanks 1 and 2 Heaters, Off; Tank 3 Heater, Auto. [Pause.]
035:09:03 Young: Okay. Rog. Configuration now: H2 Heaters 1 and 2, Auto; O2 Heaters 1 and 2, Off; 3, we're in Auto. That's as we had it. H2 Fans 1 and 2, Off; and 3, Off.
035:09:21 Peterson: Roger. [Long pause.]

035:14:06 Peterson: Roger. We'll take a look at that, and the Delta-VY is minus 0118.9. [Pause.]
035:14:18 Duke: Minus. Rog; minus 0118.9.
035:14:22 Peterson: That's affirmative. Gol.
035:14:29 Duke: Is that because we took the film over there? [Pause.]
035:14:36 Peterson: Say again, Charlie.
035:14:38 Duke: I said we took all that film over there, maybe that's the 30 pounds.
035:14:42 Peterson: Affirmative, that's where it came from. [Long pause.]

This is Apollo Control. 36 hours now into flight of Apollo 16. And the spacecraft is now in it's Passive Thermal Control mode. Rotating at the rate of three revolutions per hour. The crew is scheduled to be eating dinner and following that, they have a scheduled eight-hour rest period. Apollo 16 at the present time is 135,2 - rather 132,595 nautical miles [245,566 km] from Earth. And traveling at a speed of 4,084 feet per second [1,245 m/s].

This is Apollo Control, 37 hours now into the flight of Apollo 16, flight that has settled down into a steady, and at the moment, rather quiet routine. This is typically a quiet time of lunar missions with the crew using the time that they have available to review checklists and procedures that they'll be following during the very busy days ahead on the lunar surface and in orbit around the Moon. Also at the present time the crew is scheduled to be in the midst of a - an eat period, having diner prior to retiring for an eight-hour rest period. We've been watching all of the spacecraft systems here in Mission Control; everything looks good as it has during most of this flight and we show Apollo 16 now 134,939 nautical miles [249,907 km] from Earth, traveling at a speed of 4,013 feet per second [1,223 m/s].

037:19:19 Peterson: Okay...
037:19:20 Young: Go ahead, Pete.
037:19:21 Peterson: Okay, just a last few words here. We don't have anything for you except one note to Ken. Earlier you asked about whether or not the PAD we read you contained the correct bias for the EMS; we told you it did, and we've looked at it a little more now, and actually it turns out it did not. The bias on that one was less than a foot per second, I guess. In the future, we will include that bias in the PAD.
037:19:52 Young: Okay, thank you now.
037:19:56 Peterson: Rog and we're ready to copy any time you can give us the onboard read-outs and get into the Flight Plan here at about 37. [Pause.]
037:20:11 Young: Rog. [Long pause.]
037:20:35 Young: Okay, Houston. Bat C is 37; Pyro Bat A is 37; Pyro Bat B, 37. [Long pause.]
037:21:32 Young: RCS A is readinkg 87; RCS B, 92; RCS C, 93; RCS D, 96. Is that what you wanted, the quantity of the RCS?
037:21:57 Peterson: That's affirmative. And we copied 37, 37, 37, 87, 92, 93, and 96. [Pause.]
037:22:16 Young: That's - that's correct, and Main Bus - Bus A is reading 29 plus volts. [Long pause.]
037:23:09 Peterson: Ken, for your information, the PTC looks beautiful; in fact, it was so good, it took some of us quite a while to realize you were in a PTC. [Pause.]
037:23:22 Mattingly: Gee, and my attitude hold looks a lot like that too.
037:23:26 Peterson: Rog. [Pause.]

This is Apollo Control at 38 hours into the flight of Apollo 16. And we expect the crew will be beginning their scheduled eight-hour rest period shortly. Here in Mission Control, we're in the process of a shift handover. Flight Director Gene Kranz and his White Team of flight controllers are coming on now to replace the Orange Team headed by Flight Director Pete Frank. The Capsule Communicator on this shift will be astronaut Hank Hartsfield replacing astronaut Don Peterson in that position. And at the present time Apollo 16 is 137,239 [254,167 km] nautical miles from Earth. Traveling at a speed of 3,945 feet per second [1,202 metres].

This is Apollo Control. I would like to correct one portion of our last announcement on the shift handover. The Flight Director on this shift will be Phil Shaffer rather than Gene Kranz. At 38 hours, 4 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.

038:05:10 Hartsfield: Casper, Houston. Go ahead. [No answer.]

038:05:34 Mattingly: [Extremely weak signal.] [Garble.]
038:05:57 Hartsfield: Casper, Houston. If you're transmitting, you're way down in the mud. I can't read you. [Pause.]
038:06:07 Mattingly: Can you read now, Hank?
038:06:09 Hartsfield: Okay. Much better now, Ken. [Pause.]
038:06:14 Mattingly: Okay. I say - I got a film status report for you. And I'd like to ask you a question about the optics. I'd like to stow the optics instead of leaving them up, unless the temperatures are gonna get too high. And the reason for this is that every time we run around past the Sun, it's like throwing a spotlight inside.
038:06:39 Hartsfield: Roger. Stand by. [Long pause.]
038:07:03 Hartsfield: Okay, Ken, go ahead with your film status, and we're looking at that stowing the optics. [Pause.]
038:07:16 Mattingly: Okay, the magazine OO reads 26, magazine November November is either 33 or 34, depending on how you look at it. We finished up the 16-millimeter mag on Alpha Alpha by taking some pictures of the - part of the LM paint that we think is shredding. Magazine Oscar and November have been used just for the targeted pictures - no extras. And I guess that's - We didn't take any other original pictures today except for the AA frames on the LM. Tomorrow we'll try to get some interior photography. [Pause.]
038:08:06 Hartsfield: Okay. Copy 26 frames on Oscar Oscar. The November November report we got last night was 33 frames. You didn't use any of it today?
038:08:18 Mattingly: Well, just for that UV. So whatever it was last night, it must be one more.
038:08:25 Hartsfield: Okay. 34. [Long pause.]
038:09:04 Hartsfield: And, Ken, it's okay to stow the optics.
038:09:10 Mattingly: Okay, Henry, thank you. And I'd like to go ahead and take the voice comm down before I turn the optics power off. I wanted to try to take one last look and see if I can pick up one of the planets as we turn around, and I'd like to go ahead and knock off the voice. [Long pause.]
038:09:37 Hartsfield: Okay, Ken, get the voice down. Have a good night.
038:09:43 Mattingly: Okay, Henry. See you in the morning. Good night, sir.

038:19:57 Hartsfield: Hello, Casper, go ahead.
038:20:02 Mattingly: Okay, I'm not sure what just happened. I just saw - down looking at the optics and all of a sudden I saw a warning light and I got a No Attitude and a Gimbal Lock light. And my - my ball seems to, in fact - it looks like the platform may be frozen. [Pause.] Although we're still - still in PTC here.
038:20:34 Hartsfield: Okay, we're seeing some telemetry. We saw something about the time you come on the line there.
038:20:42 Mattingly: Okay. And it shows the CDUs down there in Noun 20 as being gimbal locked. [Long pause.]
038:21:13 Hartsfield: Stand by a little bit, Ken. We're taking a look at the telemetry.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 38 hours, 22 minutes. That was Ken Mattingly reporting what appears to be a problem in the Guidance and Navigation System on the Command Module. His voice report came almost simultaneous with a warning light on the Guidance Officer's console and reports from the Guidance Officer to the Flight Director, Phil Shaffer, here in the Control Center. Mattingly's description of the problem was that they had a warning light in the Command Module indicating No Attitude. The gimbal platform frozen - we have an indication here of gimbal lock and coarse align and we're looking at that data right now to try to determine what it might mean.

038:25:19 Hartsfield: Ken, just so we can make sure we got it straight down here, could you run through again what you were doing, and then the sequence of events?
038:25:29 Mattingly: Okay, Hank, I'm not real sure when this happened. I was trying to see if I couldn't pick up one of the planets in the optics, and I was using P52. And I had gone in and I was calling Option 3 and then putting in planet vectors out of the Flight Plan and I tried - I thought I was going to catch, I guess it was Saturn and it looked like I had just missed it. And I was driving around just kind of looking around to see what I could see in the sky and waiting to try and pick up Jupiter. And somewhere in there, I guess I came down to zero the optics or do something, and then I looked down and saw I had a PGNCS light. And I guess I had just - recently - I guess I was about ready to give up on it and call P00; and I think I had - in fact, I think I called P00 at or just before the time I - we ended up with the Gimbal Lock and the No Attitude. That was just a couple of seconds or so, I guess, before I called you about it, maybe 15 seconds or so.
038:26:85 Hartsfield: Okay, You got a Gimbal Lock...
038:26:46 Mattingly: I can't, think of any combination of DSKY inputs - I was trying to think if I could have made some combination of DSKY inputs that might have - Had I gotten in almost the right input that I could have caused the problem, but I don't see where I was using any verbs or nouns that could have done this. [Pause.]
038:27:11 Hartsfield: Okay, you got a Gimbal Lock and No Att. Did you get an ISS warning?
038:27:19 Mattingly: No, sir; I did not.
038:27:22 MCC: Go Guidance.
038:27:28 Mattingly: And the - the Noun 20s were approximately correct for both pitch and roll, although the - the middle gimbal angle was completely out to lunch.

038:32:48 Hartsfield: Go ahead, Ken. [Pause.]
038:32:55 Mattingly: I'd like for you to think about the effects of having me go ahead and do a Verb 41 Noun 20 to match up with the SCS. That thing's been drifting a good bit, but, in this case, maybe I can get it close enough to have a starting point to try and pick up some things. I'd been looking in the - had been looking in the telescope just before this all happened, and there's so much of this - so many of these little particles out there that chances of recognizing a star pattern are extremely dubious, I'd like to try. And maybe we can work on something like the Earth, maybe the Sun, or something like that.
038:33:35 MCC [not CapCom]: Go G&C.
038:33:38 Hartsfield: Okay, standby.
038:33:41 MCC [not CapCom]: Okay. Do you want to stand by on this Verb 41 Noun 20 until you get your gimbal Lock removed? Okay, CapCom tell him we're working up - Thank you. [Long pause.]
038:34:12 Hartsfield: Casper, Houston. We'd like you to hold up on the Verb 41 Noun 20. We're working on a procedure to try to get rid of the gimbal lock.
038:34:23 Mattingly: Okay. Did you have any data coming down at the time this all happened, or were you in the blind?
038:34:31 Hartsfield: Rog. We had good high bit rate data, and they're poring over that now.
038:34:39 Mattingly: Okay. I'll sit tight then. Thank you.

038:36:49 Mattingly: Go ahead.
038:36:50 Hartsfield: Okay. We want to try to get the platform inertial again, and what we'd like for you to do is a Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter, Enter, Verb 40 Enter. [Pause.]
038:37:07 Mattingly: Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter. Then you want me to put plus Enter into that register. [Pause.] Okay, that got rid of the Gimbal Lock light. Now you'd like for me to do a Verb 41?
038:37:28 Hartsfield: Verb 40 Enter.
038:37:33 Mattingly: Okay. Verb 40 Enter. [Long pause.]
038:37:46 Hartsfield: Okay. Our data shows the platform's inertial now, Ken. [Pause.]
038:37:57 Mattingly: Rog. And it appears that way from here, too. [Long pause.]
038:38:12 Hartsfield: Okay. Ken, you can go ahead now with you Verb 41 Noun 20. [Pause.]
038:38:23 Mattingly: Okay. This will be a coarse align to the GDC angles, is that correct?
038:38:26 Hartsfield: That's affirmative. [Long pause.]
038:38:53 Hartsfield: Hey, Ken, hold up on that Verb 41 just a second.
038:38:59 Mattingly: Wilco. I'll go ahead and load it but won't enter.
038:39:04 Hartsfield: Okay there. Guidance has got a little thing they're looking at and talking to people in the back room, little discussion going on here.
038:39:15 Mattingly: Okay. I won't do a thing, then. Thank you. [Long pause.]
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 38 hours, 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. What you've been listening to is Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly talking back and forth with Mission Control. We had an earlier indication that the IMU platform appeared to be in a gimbal lock. Mission...
038:40:06 Hartsfield: Casper, Houston. Are the GDC ball and the IMU ball completely out of sync? [Long pause.]
038:40:24 Mattingly: Well, actually, they're not that far out. They're like ten degrees in outer gimbal and let's see the - I guess the middle gimbal is off by about two degrees, the inner gimbal no more than three, lots closer to two degrees.
038:40:44 Hartsfield: Roger. Copy.
038:40:45 Mattingly: ...that close.

Mission Control has been going through a series of procedures with Ken Mattingly to alleviate the gimbal lock situation. Presently the platform is inertial. We'll stand by as series of Verbs and Nouns have been passed up to the spacecraft Casper. We're at 38 hours, 42 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16 now 138,786 nautical miles [257,032 km] away from Earth. This is Apollo Control, Houston.

038:57:20 Mattingly: When you combine them with the limited area that you have to look in because of the LM reflections, you find the telescope's very unsatisfying. [Long pause.]
038:58:08 Hartsfield: Casper, Houston. Why don't you go ahead and try then, with the - the Sun and the Moon? You've got a filter for the Sun, right?
038:58:15 Mattingly: That's affirmative.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 38 hours, 59 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. That was Ken Mattingly reporting difficulty sighting stars through the optics - those desired stars for alignment because of the vast number of particles. The update from CapCom Hank Hartsfield indicated a go-ahead to try the alignment using the larger objects in this case, the Sun and the Moon - for alignment. We show Casper's onboard computer program in Program 52 - this is the platform alignment program - as Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly presses on with his procedures. Apollo 16 is now 139,452 nautical miles [258,265 km] away from the Earth, and this is Apollo Control, Houston.

039:06:49 Mattingly: Houston, Casper.
039:06:53 Hartsfield: Go ahead.
039:06:57 Mattingly: Okay. I used the Earth and the Sun, and I got four balls 7, which I think is gonna be a significant improvement. I'd like to go ahead and see what those torquing angles turn out to be.
039:07:09 Hartsfield: Roger. We concur.
039:07:13 Mattingly: Okay. That looks about right for the amount that I had to correct for. It's - it's kind of hard to mark on the Earth because you have to guess where the - where the - the terminator really ought to be. [Long pause.]
039:07:33 Mattingly: and do you have those torquing angles?
039:07:35 Hartsfield: Roger, Ken. Go ahead and torque.
This is Apollo Control Houston, 39 hours, 9 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We now show Apollo 16 at 139,788 nautical miles [258,887 km] away from Earth. Command Module [Pilot] Ken Mattingly, on using the Earth and Sun for platform alignment through the optics, reports significant improvement over his earlier attempt in the star sightings. We'll continue to monitor conversations between Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly and CapCom Hank Hartsfield here in Mission Control.
039:10:29 Mattingly: Okay, Henry. If you have those angles, I'll torque these. [Long pause.]
039:10:43 Hartsfield: Ken, what was your Noun 05?
039:10:48 Mattingly: Four balls one.
039:10:50 Hartsfield: Roger.
039:10:55 Mattingly: Okay. I'll torque these at - on the minute, 11.
039:10:59 Hartsfield: Okay, clear to torque.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 39 hours, 11 minutes. Mattingly doing a second P52 platform alignment this time using two stars for sighting and in this way the fine tuning - his earlier improvement if possible with the Sun and - Mo - Earth and Sun as reference. We're at 39 hours, 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and we now show Apollo 16 at an altitude of 139,907 nautical miles [259,108 km] away from the Earth.
039:13:14 Mattingly: Okay. It looks like we're pretty much on target now, and I don't see any reason to torque these again - unless you particularly want to. [Pause.]
039:13:30 Hartsfield: Okay; we concur, Ken. Don't torque those. And we want to check a few switches. They're working on now getting a switch checklist, and then we're going to let you get some rest and smoke the data over during the night and have it stored for you in the morning.
039:13:45 Mattingly: Okay. Can you give me any - Can you give me any cursory ideas of that, just the same - if there's any possibility I entered something inadvertently? Or that take too long to sort all that out?
039:14:01 Hartsfield: Okay. The preliminary look here - We think it's a hardware problem, Ken. Some sort of a transient problem...
039:14:07 Mattingly: Okay.
039:14:08 Hartsfield: ...and when we get the data in here, we'll be able to tell a little more about it.
039:14:16 Mattingly: Okay. Guess I'm sorry to hear that.
039:14:19 Hartsfield: They - they don't think at this point that it's anything that you did, and it appears to be a transient problem, but we won't know until we take a look at it.
039:14:29 Mattingly: Okay. Let me give you one other little tidbit that now seems to be somewhat more of - of interest than it was before, and that's that when I take this Optics Zero to Zero, the area around the shaft peapack [?] makes a lot of - a lot more noise than the one in the trunnion. It seems to me that it's making more noise now than it used to. When I say used to, when we first started out - when we first started out, they were very, very quiet and you couldn't even hear them running. And now they're getting noisier. And that may be typical, but it's just one more thing that - I guess we'll throw out all these things. I'll try to minimize the number the times I zero the Optics, at least with the Zero switch. I'll use Manual wherever possible.
039:15:23 Hartsfield: Okay. That only occurs when you're zeroing?
039:15:29 Mattingly: That's affirmative. [Pause.] Well, actually, Hank, I just tried it in Manual. It occurs when - the noise occurs whenever I'm in an extremely high rate. You know, like using high in a max shaft rate.
039:15:52 Hartsfield: Roger; copy. [Long pause.]
039:16:37 Hartsfield: Okay, Ken. We'd like to check some switches up on Panel 1. [Pause.]
039:16:44 Mattingly: Stand by a second. [Long pause.]
039:17:06 Mattingly: Okay. Go ahead, Hank.
039:17:09 Hartsfield: Okay, we'd like to check position in FDAI Scale.
039:17:13 Mattingly: The Scale is in 5/1.
039:17:16 Hartsfield: Okay, Select.
039:17:20 Mattingly: Select is in 1 [garble], the Source is in Attitude Set, and the Attitude Set is in GDC.
039:17:26 Hartsfield: Okay. That's what we wanted to know. Thank you. [Pause.]
039:17:34 Mattingly: Okay, I think I'll go ahead and get some sleep then. Got any notes from [garble] yet?
039:17:40 Hartsfield: Okay, stand by one sec. [Long pause.]
039:18:06 Hartsfield: Okay, Ken. We don't have anything else [garble]. [Long pause.]
039:18:59 Hartsfield: Casper, Houston.
039:19:02 Mattingly: Go ahead.
039:19:04 Hartsfield: Okay. You caught us on the antenna switch. We don't have anything else for you. We'll look the data over, and try and get some word up to you tomorrow. It looks like to us now that you can get a full eight hours sleep. [Pause.]
039:19:18 Mattingly: Okay. [Laughter.] Thank you.
039:19:22 Hartsfield: See you tomorrow.
039:19:27 Mattingly: Okay, Hank. How about - how about making it a duller shift?
039:19:33 Hartsfield: Rog. [Laughter.]
Very long comm break.

This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 39 hours, 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We presently show Apollo 16 at a distance of 140,597 nautical miles [260,386 km] away from the Earth. As you heard, Ken Mattingly has now been given the go ahead to start his sleep period. This being the case, we will go over and recount the activities that have just taken place regarding the Guidance and Navigation System. It - this activity was spurred when Mattingly saw a Gimbal Lock warning light on board and a No Attitude light on board. This was verified by the Mission Control team here on the ground. The first step taken, the IMU was coarse aligned to - to the spacecraft body. When this occurred, this alignment wiped out the roll attitude in reference. The first step, Mattingly was given the go ahead to unlock the platform with ground procedures, and this allowed the platform to go inertial. Initially, he tried to align the platform with stars. He was unsuccessful with the platform alignment with stars and this - primarily because of the debris around the spacecraft. As a next step, he then used the Sun and Moon to align the platform and was very successful in this effort. Then the platform was tweaked in its alignment using the stars; and this was possible because the platform alignment with the initial planet reference was good enough to use the Auto Optics. Here in Mission Control during this shift, we will be playing the recorded data, and this will be evaluated over the course of the shift. Initially, it appears to be a transient problem. We're at 39 hours, 33 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We show Apollo 16 140,686 nautical miles [260,550 km] away from the Earth. Velocity now 3,845 feet per second [1,172 m/s]; and this is Apollo Control, Houston.

This is Apollo Control, Houston at 40 hours, 35 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We presently show Apollo 16 at an altitude of 142,978 nautical miles [264,795 km], this from Earth, and traveling at a speed of 3,779 feet per second [1,152 m/s]. The crew is now sleeping after a flurry of activity related to a - the Guidance and Navigation system. Ken Mattingly, it appears, went to sleep at 40 hours GET, dozed off to sleep. At an earlier time - 38 hours, 22 minutes GET - the Command Module had a Gimbal Lock warning and a No Attitude light on board. This was verified by the flight controllers here in the Mission Control Center. The Inertial Measuring Unit had been coarse aligned to the spacecraft body when this problem developed. It wiped out the roll attitude reference. As a first step, Ken Mattingly, Command Module Pilot, unlocked the platform with ground procedures allowing the platform to go inertial. A first attempt by Ken Mattingly to align the platform using stars was unsuccessful because of the debris around the spacecraft. He then used the Sun and Moon as references to align the platform and this attempt was very successful. As a follow-on step, Mattingly then tweaked the alignment of the platform with the stars. He was successful in this second attempt because the platform at this time was good enough to use the auto optics. There has been very little conversation over the Flight Control Loop here in the Mission Control Center for the past 30 to 40 minutes. During this shift the recorded data is being replayed for a continuing evaluation. At present it appears that what we have seen is a transient problem to the Guidance and Navigation System. It should be emphasized Ken Mattingly did successfully realign the inertial platform before getting the go ahead to start his sleep period. A confirmed failure, of the IMU would give a No-Go for LOI, however at this time the Guidance and Navigation platform is completely stable and the ground control team here in Mission Control is satisfied. We're at 48 hours, 38 - 40 hours, 38 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We will at this point take down the Air to Ground Loop because we expect no further conversations with the crew. This is Apollo Control, Houston.

This is Apollo Control, Houston at 41 hours, 30 minutes into the mission. We presently show Apollo 16 at a distance of 144,956 nautical miles [268,548 km] away from Earth. Velocity now reads 3,724 feet per second [1,135 m/s]. We've had no conversation with the crew of Apollo 16 since our last report. The crew is presently in their rest period. Our Flight Director for this shift is Phil Shaffer. It is his first stint in the role of Flight Director. Until this mission, Shaffer has worked as Flight Dynamics Officer in the Mission Control Center. He's one of the new Flight Directors designated for the Skylab Program. Our CapCom for this shift is Astronaut Hank Hartsfield. He does not expect to have anything further to say to the crew of Apollo 16 this shift. Since our countdown clock in the Mission Control Center shows 5 hours, 59 minutes of time remaining until wake-up time, this will put the wake-up time about two hours beyond that called for in the Flight Plan. We're at 41 hours, 31 minutes into the mission; and this is Apollo Control, Houston.

This is Apollo Control, Houston at 42 hours, 30 minutes since lift-off. We presently show Apollo 16 at a distance of 147,092 nautical miles [272,414 km] away from the Earth. Velocity now shows 3,665 feet per second [1,117 m/s]. We've had no conversation with the crew of Apollo 16 over the past hour. There are some five minutes remaining on the sleep period. We're at 42 hours, 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 42 hours, 32 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We have a correction to our last report. A sleepy commentator reported five minutes remaining on the sleep period for the Apollo 16 crew. That should have been stated five hours remaining. I repeat, five hours remaining of crew sleep. We're at 42 hours, 32 minutes into the mission and this is Apollo Control, Houston.

This is Apollo Control, Houston at 43 hours, 30 minutes into the flight of Apollo 16. We now show the Apollo 16 spacecraft at a distance of 149,191 nautical miles [276,302 km] away from the Earth and now traveling at a speed of 3,608 feet per second [1,100 m/s]. At the present time, the crew of Apollo 16 is asleep. Also, at the present time, the Mission Control Center here in Houston is receiving periodic data from the Apollo 16 spacecraft due to an inability to switch antennas by ground command. At present, here in Mission Control, we're receiving 11 minutes of data, and seven and a half minutes of data dropout. This will become a troubleshooting exercise with the crew after the crew awakens. The INCO flight controller has tried through the Madrid and Carnarvon stations, but thus far, has not been able to get in commands to switch antennas. This inability in antenna switching from the ground is why we're receiving the periodic data. The crew will remain in their sleep period for four more hours. At 43 hours, 32 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control, Houston.

This is Apollo Control, Houston at 44 hours, 30 minutes into the mission. We presently show Apollo 16 at a distance of 151,216 nautical miles [280,052 km] away from the Earth. Velocity now reads 5,353 [should be 3,553] feet per second [1,083 m/s]. Flight Director Phil Shaffer has decided to update the crew wakeup time by one hour. This being one hour earlier because of the work day. This one hour will allow spare time for troubleshooting associated with the antenna switching. There will be a change of shift briefing at 9:30 am in the News Center Briefing Room. Participants will include Flight Director Phil Shaffer and Guidance and Control flight controller Gary Coen. The Gold Team of flight controllers headed by Flight Director Gerry Griffin is scheduled to take over at 46 hours Ground Elapsed Time. At the present time, we show 1 hour, 59 minutes from time of crew wakeup. At 44 hours, 31 minutes; this is Apollo Control, Houston.

This is Apollo Control; 45 hours, 24 minutes Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 16. Spacecraft, at the present time, is 153,107 nautical miles [283,554 km] out from Earth. Velocity, 3,504 feet per second [1,068 m/s]. Here in the Mission Control Center, the Gold Team of flight controllers taking over headed up by Gerry Griffin, from the off-going shift of flight controllers headed up by a new Flight Director named Phil Shaffer. Phil Shaffer's press conference will take place in the News Center Auditorium, the Houston News Center, in about 10 minutes. The crew of Apollo 16 will be waked up in a little over an hour. The first order of business upon awakening will be to sort out some problems that have arisen during the night on uplink commands to the spacecraft, and also a gimbal lock problem in the Inertial Measurement Unit that was encountered during the night when Mattingly was realigning the platform, both of which may just go away. That remains to be seen. And at 45 hours, 26 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
