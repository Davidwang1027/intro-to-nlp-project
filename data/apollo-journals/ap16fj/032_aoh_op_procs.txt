Apollo 16 - Apollo Operations Handbook
Operational Procedures - Index
Volume 2 of the Apollo Operations Handbook contains the detailed operating procedures for the various systems in the spacecraft, under both normal and emergency conditions. These procedures were then used to develop the checklists used by the spacecraft crew during the mission. This section of the Apollo16 Flight Journal contains scans of the 847 pages of Operational Procedures.
The version of the document here is dated 17 July 1970, almost 2 years before Apollo 16 flew. In practice, the procedures on the crew checklists were subject to constant amendment up until, and during, the flight.
