This is Apollo Control, Houston at 91 hours, 24 minutes into the mission. We're standing by now awaiting a wake-up call by CapCom Don Peterson to the crew of Apollo 16. We show Apollo 16 presently with an apolune of 58.9 nautical miles [109.1 kilometres] and a perilune of 10.4 nautical miles [19.3 kilometres].
091:25:41 Peterson Apollo 16, Houston. [No answer.]
091:25:51 Peterson Apollo 16, Houston.
091:26:25 Mattingly: How you down there this morning, Houston?
091:26:27 Peterson Just fine. How are you, 16? [Pause.]
091:26:35 Mattingly: Charging hard.
091:26:37 Peterson Roger. Got about three short items and a SIM bay status, if you're ready. [Pause.]
091:26:50 Mattingly: Okay. Can we hold off on the SIM bay status? And I'll copy your three short items.
091:26:55 Peterson Roger.
091:26:58 Peterson Okay. The first one is - based on our evaluation, your potassium levels are running a little low, and we'd like to recommend that you drink some orange juice this morning. [Pause.] Also, you've got a long day ahead of you, so we'd like to recommend that you eat a bit more food. [Pause.] Second item is terminate Battery Bravo charge. The third item is terminate the jet-on monitor. [Long pause.]
091:27:53 Mattingly: Okay, Don. [Pause.]
091:28:02 Mattingly: Okay, Don. Number one, I understand your comment about the potassium low and all that jazz. We've just finished up breakfast, and I think we've eaten almost everything that the LMies have to eat. And we - we've been drinking all the drinks every day. And, if we get a chance, well we'll try to get some more - get another juice bag out. We will terminate the Battery B charge and terminate the Jet Monitor, and I understand the way to do the Jet Monitor is - I'll go to - I'll go to the SCS mode and key a Verb 37 Noun 20 and then verify that Noun 26 is all zeros again. And I can go back to P20. is that correct?
091:28:55 Peterson Stand by one. [Pause.]
091:29:02 Peterson There's no requirement to go to SCS, 16.
091:29:09 Mattingly: Okay. I can just call [Verb] 37 [Noun] 20 without getting any firings?
Comm break.

091:31:10 Peterson 16, just to be sure we're talking the same thing - to kill the jet-on Monitor, we want to do a Verb 37 Enter, 30 Enter, a Verb 37 Enter, 20 Enter and zero the Noun 26. [Long pause.]
091:32:05 Mattingly: Don, I can't get to the Updates Book where that's written down. Would you read it to me slowly, and I'll do that terminate right now.
091:32:11 Peterson Okay, it's Verb 37 Enter, 30 Enter, Verb 37 Enter, 20 Enter, zero the Noun 26. [Pause.]
091:32:31 Peterson And, 16, you're about one minute to LOS, and you're looking good. [Pause.]
091:32:39 Mattingly: Okay. And we've - we're taking an extra orange with potassium this morning.
091:32:43 Peterson Roger. [Long pause.]
091:33:06 Young: Houston, 16. Take a look at that biomed off of me and see how it looks. Over.
091:33:14 Peterson Okay. [Pause.]
091:33:20 Young: I got it reset - from yesterday.
091:33:28 Peterson Ken, still looks a little loose. [Pause.]
091:33:35 Young: Well, it's not loose. [Pause.]
091:33:40 Peterson We'll have to take a better look at it next time around, Ken. [Pause.]
091:33:48 Young: Okay. This is John, and the sensors are fixed. [Pause.]
091:34:01 Peterson We've got confusion down here on who we're monitoring, John. [Long pause.]
091:34:42 Peterson John, the lead we're concerned with is the sternal lead - the one on your breastbone. You might jiggle it a little bit. [Long pause.]
091:35:05 Mattingly: Gee, we're doing that. It sure looks like it's all tight.
091:35:09 Peterson Okay. [Long pause.]
091:35:35 Peterson John, you might try putting new sponges on that lead. [Pause.]
CM transcript starts at 091:35:43 and finishes 091:39:18.
091:35:43 Young: Okay. I did that last night.
091:35:49 Peterson Okay. We'll pick you up next rev and talk about it.
Very long comm break.
Loss of Signal at 91:37.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 91 hours, 37 minutes into the mission. We've had Loss of Signal with Apollo 16. The last conversation aboard the spacecraft was John Young checking on his biomedical sensors. We're at 91 hours, 37 minutes into the mission and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
091:36:27 Mattingly (CM onboard): Here you go.
091:36:29 Duke (CM onboard): Want to change with me now?
091:37:14 Crew (CM onboard): [Garble].
091:37:54 Young (CM onboard): [Garble].
091:37:56 Mattingly (CM onboard): Share the drink.
091:37:58 Young (CM onboard): [Garble].
091:38:04 Duke (CM onboard): Okay. I'm not gonna make you drink it.
091:38:10 Mattingly (CM onboard): You want yours, Charlie?
091:38:12 Duke (CM onboard): [Garble].
091:38:14 Mattingly (CM onboard): There you are.
091:38:19 Young (CM onboard): I got a [garble].
091:38:22 Mattingly (CM onboard): Okay.
091:38:38 Young (CM onboard): [Garble] to the [garble] very cold.
091:39:00 Young (CM onboard): Okay, we're eating.
091:39:03 Mattingly (CM onboard): Okay, have you got all the - got all the bags filled with tools and all that stuff?
091:39:14 Young (CM onboard): Yeah, we're...
091:39:16 Mattingly (CM onboard): You got the pills down there, Charlie?
091:39:18 Duke (CM onboard): Sure [garble] right there.

This is Apollo Control at 92 hours, 15 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and some 13 minutes, 12 seconds until Apollo 16 reappears from behind the Moon in this tenth lunar orbit. Gerry Griffin's Gold Team of flight controllers settled in for the day's activities leading up to powered descent and lunar landing. The offgoing shift of flight controllers have practically all left the room having debriefed their replacements. There will not be a change of shift briefing. Repeat, will not be a change of shift briefing, in as much as the preceding shift was primarily a sleep shift. Apollo 16 still in a 59 by 10.6-nautical-mile [109.3 by 19.6-kilometre] lunar orbit. Current velocity - orbital velocity, 5,355 feet [1,632 metres] per second. And current altitude at this point in the orbit, 44.8 nautical miles [83.0 kilometres]. 11 minutes [and] 57 seconds to Apollo 16 acquisition. At 92:16, this is Apollo Control

This is Apollo Control; 92 hours, 27 minutes into the mission of Apollo 16. Less than a minute away from Apollo 16's reappearance around the eastern limb of the Moon on lunar orbit number 10. On this next frontside pass, the main concern of the crew will be transferring quite a few of the pieces of gear and equipment into the Lunar Module, getting the Lunar Module prepared for the descent and landing at the Descartes landing site. Six minutes away, we may be a few moments late getting acquisition because of the apparent position of the High Gain Antenna as seen on the ground by the communications officer. Waiting for confirmation of Acquisition Of Signal by the tracking network. Flight Director Gerry Griffing - Griffin is polling all of his flight controllers on the current status and preparation for the landing phase. Getting all the details worked out. Any minor problems the different positions - console positions might have.
092:29:40 Irwin: 16, this is Houston. Standing by.
092:29:46 Mattingly: Hello, Jim.
092:29:47 Irwin: Morning.
092:29:49 Mattingly: We're in the process of a little suit donning here, and we've got one problem. When I went to retract the mass spectrometer, and the gamma ray boom came in fine, but the mass spectrometer boom indicates barber pole and has stayed barber pole about ten minutes. I went ahead and enabled the jets. And I'd like for you to take a look at the - at the - telemetry talkback on the boom, and see if you can suggest something for me to do.
092:30:15 Irwin: Okay, we copy.
092:30:16 Mattingly: Barber pole. It's a total barber pole.
092:30:18 Irwin: We copy, Ken.
092:30:20 Mattingly: Okay. [Long pause.]
092:31:19 Irwin: 16, this is Houston. We're wondering if you've gone through the malfunction procedure for that Boom Retraction on page 1-24 of the Systems Handbook?
092:31:31 Mattingly: Well, I looked and didn't find one that was appropriate.
092:31:35 Irwin: Okay. I guess you're right, Ken. [Pause.]
092:31:48 Mattingly: We're pretty busy, as you knows Jim: and so I'd really appreciate it if you could talk me through whatever steps you want.
092:31:53 Irwin: Okay; understand. [Long pause.]
092:32:30 Irwin: 16, this is Houston. We'd like you to put the Mass Spec Boom switch to the Off position. That's if it's not there already.
092:32:39 Mattingly: Okay. And when I do, it goes to gray.
092:32:45 Irwin: Understand, it goes to gray. [Pause.]
092:32:52 Mattingly: That's affirmative.

092:35:00 Irwin: 16, this is Houston. We had understood that you had activated all your RCS jets. We show you still in the SIM bay configuration. [Long pause.]
092:35:19 Mattingly: Okay. Thank you. I have the switches with the circuit breakers I had left out.
092:35:25 Irwin: Roger. [Long pause.]
092:35:38 Irwin: 16, this is Houston. You can go normal acquisition procedures on the S-band.
092:35:45 Mattingly: Okay. [Long pause.]
092:36:19 Mattingly: Jim, what did you want me to do with that High Gain?
092:36:24 Irwin: We wanted you to go through normal acquisition procedures. [Long pause.]
092:37:19 Irwin: 16, will you go Auto on the High Gain?
092:37:26 Mattingly: You have it.
092:37:29 Irwin: Okay. [Long pause.]
092:38:14 Irwin: Six - Never mind. [Long pause.]
092:38:46 Irwin: Okay, 16. This is Houston. We have SIM bay data now. Will you go back to Retract on the - on the Boom switch? [Pause.]
092:38:59 Mattingly: Okay. [Pause.] You have Retract, Jim.
092:39:10 Irwin: Roger. [Long pause.]
092:40:09 Irwin: 16, this is Houston. Will you check the talkback on that boom, and tell us whether it's full barber pole or a partial? [Pause.]
092:40:22 Mattingly: It's the same as it's been, Jim. It's a barber pole, full.
092:40:27 Irwin: Okays we copy; a full barber pole. We show it partially retracted within acceptable limits. [Pause.]
092:40:38 Mattingly: What do you mean partially retracted? Does that mean your telemetry point has cinched closure?
092:40:44 Irwin: That's affirmative.
092:40:49 Mattingly: Okay, then I'll put it back into the Off position?
092:40:53 Irwin: Stand by, Ken. I think we - we want it in Retract.
092:40:59 Mattingly: Okay, I'll leave it in Retract.
092:41:04 Irwin: Okay, you could put the Retract switch back to the Off position. [Pause.]
092:41:14 Mattingly: Okay, Retract is Off.
092:41:16 Irwin: Roger.
092:41:19 Mattingly: If you can watch that thing on telemetry, I can extend it enough to clear it and then try a Retract again. [Pause.]
092:41:30 Irwin: Okay, let's - We're within limits, Ken. Let's hold what we have. [Pause.]
092:41:39 Mattingly: Okay.

092:43:47 Mattingly: Okay, Jim. On the docking latch number 10, I've got some observations, if you're ready. [Pause.]
092:43:56 Irwin: Roger. We're ready, Ken. Go ahead.
092:44:01 Mattingly: Okay, when I look in under the LM umbilical connector cover, the roller cam looks normal, and everything I can see from that side looks correct. When I look under the cover on the right side - that's the probe connector cover - I look at the bungee in the - the little arm that sticks out from the bottom of the cam - when I compare it to another latch, it doesn't stick out as far; in fact, the back of this part - this inner piece of the bell crank - I can get the part number on it, and it's - it's flush; whereas, on the other end, it sticks out and it shows the pin; so it looks like it hasn't come over center. Sorry I don't have the right part nomenclature.
092:44:51 Irwin: Roger; we copy.
092:44:52 Mattingly: If you had a docking latch on the table there, somewhere, you could see what I'm looking at. [Long pause.]
092:45:33 Irwin: Ken, this is Houston. Can you see anything that might be obstructing or interfering with that cam action?
092:45:42 Mattingly: No, sir; I can't.
092:45:44 Irwin: Okay. [Long pause.]
092:46:28 Irwin: Okay, 16; this is Houston. if you go to P00 and Accept, we'll uplink you. Okay, just Accept. [Pause.]
092:46:41 Mattingly: You're there.

092:58:51 Mattingly: Houston, we just passed over the good landing site, and you can see the whole area. Stands out very nicely just like the model.
092:59:01 Irwin: Very good, Ken. Thank you. [Long pause.]
092:59:39 Mattingly: Houston, from my present position I can't be sure exactly where I am because I just looked out the window again but - we passed over a large crater, and it has three little domes in the bottom of it with craters in the top of them; and they look like very subtle cinder cones. I'll try to mark that guy on the way back. It's one of a cluster of two large ones and several smaller ones.
093:00:03 Irwin: Roger. We copy, Ken.
Comm break.
093:01:30 Irwin: 16, this is - Houston. Will you give us another reading on that docking tunnel index when you have an opportunity?
093:01:40 Mattingly: It's still the same thing: minus 3.5.
093:01:43 Irwin: Roger. Minus 3.5.
093:01:48 Mattingly: Affirm.

093:06:07 Irwin: 16, this is Houston...
093:06:09 Mattingly: Houston, 16.
093:06:10 Irwin: We assume the - Go ahead, 16.
093:06:15 Mattingly: Okay. John and Charlie got their suits on and they're in the LM. Is there any reason they shouldn't go ahead and power up and get some cooling?
093:06:25 Irwin: Stand by. [Pause.]
093:06:33 Irwin: Okay, let's proceed, Ken.
093:06:38 Mattingly: Okay, we'll proceed. [Long pause.]
This is Apollo Control. Apollo 16 Commander John Young and Lunar Module Pilot Charlie Duke are running almost 40 minutes ahead of the Flight Plan, in as much as they've already donned their pressure suits and they're in the Lunar Module, preparing to power it up. Flight Plan calls for transfer...
093:07:21 Mattingly: Houston; Orion on internal power at 93:07.
093:07:25 Irwin: Roger. [Long pause.]
093:07:46 Irwin: And, Ken, this is Houston. The reason for that undervoltage last night was that the - all the heaters just happened to come on at that particular time.
093:07:59 Mattingly: Say again, Jim. We were cycling over to relief valve at the time [chuckle].
093:08:04 Irwin: I'll talk to you later.
093:08:09 Mattingly: Okay. Did you get my call on the LM power at 93:07?
093:08:14 Irwin: Sure did; 93:07.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control. Some 25 minutes remaining now in this frontside pass in the tenth lunar orbit of Apollo 16 before the still docked Orion and Casper go around the corner on the western limb of the Moon. At 93:09, still live on the tenth lunar orbit, this is Apollo Control.
093:10:34 Irwin: 16, this is Houston. S-Band Aux Sci switched to Off. Over. [Pause.]
093:10:45 Mattingly: That's Off.
093:10:47 Irwin: Roger.

093:19:25 Mattingly: Houston, can I give you some torquing angles, or did you copy them?
093:19:29 Irwin: We have them, Ken.
093:19:33 Mattingly: Okay, and we're in the maneuver.
093:19:36 Irwin: Roger. [Long pause.]
This is Apollo Control. The maneuver, referred to just then by Ken Mattingly aboard the Command Module Casper, was the maneuver to the undocking attitude which has a Roll 0, Pitch 104, and Yaw 0; just about on time as called for in the Flight Plan. Some 14 minutes and 8 seconds until Loss of Signal, this is Apollo Control at 93:20.
093:20:23 Irwin: Ken, this is Houston. Our plan on the mass spec boom is to leave it where it is, and we're going to ask John and Charlie to check it after undocking, with respect to position. [Pause.]
093:20:46 Mattingly: Okay.
093:20:48 Irwin: And when I was trying to talk to you before, I just wanted to give you the words on that undervoltage which y'all had last night. The reason for that was the fact that all the heaters came on at the same time. Over.
093:21:05 Mattingly: Okay, I guess maybe I jumped the gun, but it seemed to me like that - that Master Alarm came on instantly when I hit that switch, and it seemed like the only prudent thing to do was to undo what I just did. [Pause.] I'm glad to hear that, though. Thank you. [Long pause.]
093:21:44 Irwin: And, Ken, if you're - got a few minutes there - I could give you a Flight Plan update, a very short one.
093:21:51 Mattingly: Could - could you hold it? I'm in the middle of - suit donning and canister change.
093:21:56 Irwin: Okay.

This is Apollo Control. We have confirmation that the communications system aboard the Lunar Module is activated. We're beginning to get data out of the LM.
093:25:11 Irwin: Ken, will you have Orion select the aft antenna? [Pause.]
093:25:19 Duke: Okay, Jim. You got it.
093:25:22 Irwin: Very good. We're reading you loud and clear.
093:25:27 Duke: And you're really beautiful, too. We are on Page 3-6, Step 6. We'd have been a little bit further along, but we had trouble with John's zipper today.
093:25:38 Young: [Garble] I tried to [garble]. [Long pause.]
093:26:09 Irwin: Orion, will you go Down Voice Backup? [Long pause.]
093:26:54 Duke: [Garble] Casper, over. [Garble] Okay.
093:27:15 Irwin: Casper, this is Houston. If there's anyth - anything significant from Orion, will you relay, because there is excessive noise down here.
093:27:26 Duke: How do you read, Jim? [Long pause.]
093:27:42 Irwin: Casper, this is Houston. How do you read?

This is Apollo Control. Five minutes away from Loss of Signal as Apollo 16 passes behind the Moon. Lunar Module cabin now showing at 5.02 pounds per square inch pressure [34.6 kPa]. Suit pressure 4.98 [psi - 34.33 kPa] for both men. Cabin temperature 68°F [20°C].
093:30:17 Irwin: Orion, this is Houston. How do you read?
093:30:22 Mattingly: You're five by, Jim. How me?
093:30:25 Irwin: Roger; we're reading you. We still got a lot of noise, but we don't have the big dish up yet.
093:30:32 Duke: Okay, we got a signal strength of about 3.9 on the Aft Omni.
093:30:37 Irwin: Roger. Understand 3.9 on the Aft Omni.
093:31:26 Duke: [Garble.] Noisy, ain't it? [Long pause.]
093:31:59 Duke: [Garble.] Just a minute. [Long pause.]
093:32:19 Irwin: 16, this is Houston. You're two minutes, LOS. [Pause.]
093:32:28 Mattingly: Okay, thank you. You got it.
093:32:51 Young: Can you read me, Charlie?
093:32:52 Duke: Yeah.
093:32:55 Young: I don't read you.
093:32:56 Duke: You don't have your audio breaker in, do you?
093:32:59 Young: Yeah.
093:33:01 Duke: Did you turn on your stuff?
093:33:04 Young: Yeah. [Pause.]
093:33:15 Duke: How's that? How's that?
093:33:18 Young: That's better. Okay. Thank you. What was that? How did you fix that?
093:33:25 Duke: I just put my mike closer to my mouth.
093:33:27 Young: Okay, fine. [Garble].
093:33:28 Duke: And talked up a little bit. I've got my Master Volume up full.
093:33:31 Young: Me, too. [Pause.]
093:33:40 Young: Okay, where are you at, Charlie?
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We've had Loss of Signal as Apollo 16, still docked at this time, passed behind the Moon during the end of the 10th lunar orbit. The crew of Apollo 16 considerably ahead of the timeline and getting the Lunar Module manned and checked out. All three crewmen suited at this time. Approximately 46, 47 minutes until acquisition. We'll come back up at acquisition at the start of lunar orbit revolution number 11, lunar orbit number 11, and at 93:35, this is Apollo Control.
093:53:32 Duke (LM onboard): How do you read, Ken?
093:53:34 Mattingly (LM onboard): Loud and clear.
093:53:35 Duke (LM onboard): Wow. You're just super also.
093:53:38 Mattingly (LM onboard): Well, at least we got one improvement over the simulators.
093:53:41 Duke (LM onboard): Boy, I'll say.
093:53:45 Young (LM onboard): Okay. That's really good.
093:53:47 Mattingly (LM onboard): Outstanding.
093:53:48 Duke (LM onboard): Okay. Go...
093:53:49 Mattingly (LM onboard): [Garble] How about a - you need a 16 65 before I get away from here, John?
093:53:56 Young (LM onboard): No, I - no, I - Tell him no.
093:53:59 Duke (LM onboard): No.
093:54:00 Young (LM onboard): I can hear him - I can hear him through your headset.
093:54:03 Duke (LM onboard): Go B to Receive and - and then VHF A to T/R.
093:54:12 Young (LM onboard): Okay. Okay. What's those numbers again?
093:54:16 Duke (LM onboard): 36673 -
093:54:18 Young (LM onboard): That's the LM weight?
093:54:19 Duke (LM onboard): Yeah. And 39329.
Short period of CM transcript from 093:54:31 to 094:01:38.
093:54:31 Mattingly (CM onboard): We're through with the LM umbilicals, I hope.
093:54:33 Duke (LM onboard): Yes, sir.
093:54:45 Mattingly (CM onboard): There's a lot of [garble] up here.
093:54:57 Duke (LM onboard): Man, this zero gravity is so neat.
093:55:01 Mattingly (CM onboard): I think it's almost as easy to [garble] it was designed [garble] Yes, sir. I'm gonna count them [garble] at least a dozen [garble] Yeah. I'll stow them.
093:55:02 Duke (LM onboard): Yeah. You take the umbilicals onto your side? That's new, huh?
093:55:07 Duke (LM onboard): Okay. On my checklist, it says verify them stowed.
093:55:23 Mattingly (LM onboard): [Garble].
093:55:24 Duke (LM onboard): Huh? Okay.
093:55:39 Duke (LM onboard): It says both electrical umbilicals removed. Drogue - Oh, yeah. It does say remove them.
093:55:23 Mattingly (CM onboard): Yeah. We don't want to - we don't want to leave these up here .... get in the way.
093:55:44 Young (LM onboard): Hey, Ken?
093:55:46 Young (LM onboard): If you get into Min Dead Band Attitude hold, I can go ahead and do this coarse align.
093:55:49 Mattingly (CM onboard): Huh? What?
093:55:49 Duke (LM onboard): Wait - Wait a - No, wait a minute. Let - you can't do it without his numbers. And he's doing the tunnel stuff now.
093:56:00 Young (LM onboard): Okay.
093:56:02 Duke (LM onboard): He wanted you to go - to do the coarse align, but let's do the tun - whatever you think's faster.
093:56:06 Mattingly (CM onboard): Yeah, we're - The only way we'll keep from screwing up is to follow the checklist. Which comes after - comes after the tunnel. Wait a minute. After what? No, sir. I got a coarse align that comes 40 minutes after probe and drogue. If I get out of sync, I'm going to make you run the [garble] Well, you're way ahead of your time line, and I'm just barely hanging on.
093:56:24 Mattingly (LM onboard): [Garble] coarse alignment [garble].
093:56:37 Duke (LM onboard): Okay, go ahead. I just didn't see that. Ours just has us at - way ahead of that.
093:56:39 Mattingly (LM onboard): [Garble].
093:56:42 Duke (LM onboard): Oh, I see what - Okay, you're right. All I'm supposed to do is verify this stuff. Let him get that end, John. We - we're in Fat City. Man, I'm putting a lot of load on this suit in the back...
093:57:13 Young (LM onboard): It's all zipped.
093:57:14 Duke (LM onboard): ...when I straighten my legs up.
093:57:28 Duke (LM onboard): Hey, I don't get much feedback in my mikes. I thought I'd be able to hear myself.
093:57:41 Young (LM onboard): You know what we need is some orange juice things over here - drinks.
093:57:44 Duke (LM onboard): We got some.
093:57:46 Young (LM onboard): Do we?
093:57:47 Duke (LM onboard): Uh-huh.
093:58:09 Young (LM onboard): That water's not leaking, is it?
093:58:10 Duke (LM onboard): No. It's not.
093:58:21 Mattingly (CM onboard): Putting all this stuff in here. Trying to put the food on and then do [garble] food [garble].
093:58:47 Duke (LM onboard): Looks great.
093:58:51 Mattingly (CM onboard): Okay. Let's start on the business. You say put the probe in, huh? I'll probe and drogue [garble] probe and drogue [garble].
093:59:28 Young (LM onboard): I could do the landing gear deploy. You want to do that?
093:59:42 Duke (LM onboard): Yeah, that sounds all right to me. They don't have to see that.
093:59:46 Young (LM onboard): Okay. Tell Ken we're gonna deploy the landing gear.
093:59:51 Duke (LM onboard): Hey, Ken. If you hear a thump, we're gonna deploy the landing gear.
093:59:52 Mattingly (CM onboard): Yeah. Okay.
093:59:59 Young (LM onboard): Okay. Circuit Breaker 11...
Begin Lunar Rev 11 at 094:00.
094:00:00 Duke (LM onboard): What page are you on?
094:00:02 Young (LM onboard): It's on Page 1 - 3-17.

094:00:30 Duke (LM onboard): There they go.
094:00:32 Mattingly (CM onboard): Holy smoke!
094:00:34 Young (LM onboard): Got a- a -
094:00:36 Duke (LM onboard): No doubt in my mind. You get a gray?
094:00:38 Young (LM onboard): Gray.
094:00:39 Duke (LM onboard): Okay. ED 11, Logic Power A, Close.
094:00:41 Young (LM onboard): Logic Power A is closed.

094:00:52 Duke (LM onboard): Hey, it's out, John! I can see the front footpad.
094:00:59 Young (LM onboard): Okay, and then what?
094:01:00 Duke (LM onboard): And then look at the front footpad. Master Arm, Off.
094:01:04 Young (LM onboard): Okay.
094:01:05 Duke (LM onboard): CB 11, ED Logic Power...
094:01:07 Young (LM onboard): Landing Gear Flag, open.
094:01:08 Duke (LM onboard): Yeah, Landing Gear Flag. Man, have we got the condensation in here. Looks like you're serious about this.
094:01:19 Mattingly (CM onboard): Okay. You got the - you got some - three capture latches in there? All righty.
094:01:21 Duke (LM onboard): Yeah, they look okay.
094:01:23 Young (LM onboard): Hey, you - Is this your pair of scissors here, Charlie?
094:01:27 Duke (LM onboard): In there, yeah.
094:01:28 Young (LM onboard): Did you take them out of here?
094:01:30 Duke (LM onboard): I took them out of the data card kit.
094:01:31 Young (LM onboard): Okay.
094:01:38 Mattingly (CM onboard): Last chance to swap seats, Charlie. I got my LOG all ready.
End of CM transcript until 094:21:59.
094:01:44 Duke (LM onboard): [Garble] Man, this - this water cooling is so nice, Ken.
094:02:19 Young (LM onboard): Okay, we've done that.
094:02:49 Young (LM onboard): Are you in Auto on the Quads? No. Okay. Going to Auto on the Quads, Charlie.
094:02:54 Duke (LM onboard): Okay.
094:02:56 Young (LM onboard): That was at 94:02 - 02:57.
094:03:05 Duke (LM onboard): Check the quad temps.
094:03:10 Young (LM onboard): Super. They're already up there, ain't they?
094:03:13 Duke (LM onboard): Yeah, I push - those breakers on your side are...
094:03:16 Young (LM onboard): Man...
094:03:17 Duke (LM onboard): ...manual. I mean they're - they cycle on and off by themselves.
094:03:34 Young (LM onboard): Hey, let's get the AOT reticule thing out and put it on.
094:03:40 Duke (LM onboard): Oh. I forgot that. That's part of the housekeeping.
094:03:42 Young (LM onboard): Yeah.
094:03:52 Duke (LM onboard): I wonder how I forgot that?
094:03:58 Young (LM onboard): Is it in there?
094:03:59 Duke (LM onboard): Yeah, here it is.
094:04:11 Duke (LM onboard): Okay, you got it.
094:04:12 Young (LM onboard): What are you, a southpaw?
094:04:13 Duke (LM onboard): I'd look out the - yeah, I'll look out the other way.
094:04:17 Young (LM onboard): Beautiful.
094:04:35 Duke (LM onboard): What's your problem?
094:05:12 Young (LM onboard): Okay, Charlie.
094:05:34 Duke (LM onboard): It's not in here.
094:05:41 Young (LM onboard): What's not?
094:05:42 Duke (LM onboard): That AOT thing.
094:05:43 Young (LM onboard): What AOT thing?
094:05:45 Duke (LM onboard): During the housekeeping.
094:05:49 Young (LM onboard): Don't worry about it, Charlie.
094:05:50 Duke (LM onboard): I know it. I just wanted to write it down for the [Apollo] 17 guys.
094:05:53 Young (LM onboard): Oh.
094:06:11 Duke (LM onboard): My ears have cleared up, John. I mean my sinuses.
094:06:15 Young (LM onboard): Mine, too. You know why?
094:06:17 Duke (LM onboard): Why?
094:06:18 Young (LM onboard): With as much simulator time as we got ... What's the matter, Ken?
094:06:35 Mattingly (LM onboard): [Garble].
094:06:43 Duke (LM onboard): You got three capture latches.
094:06:44 Mattingly (LM onboard): [Garble].
094:06:46 Duke (LM onboard): Yeah. And it's tight. I can't budge it. You know, I wish I could cut my microphone off on my left side. That way I wouldn't get this drink bag squa - squirted in my face every time.
094:07:12 Young (LM onboard): Pretty exciting, isn't it? [Garble] me another shot of water, Charlie.
094:07:21 Duke (LM onboard): Okay (laughter).
094:07:32 Young (LM onboard): That's good. That's enough.
094:07:36 Duke (LM onboard): Come on. Let's chill it down a little bit.
094:07:37 Young (LM onboard): Oh. Think that's enough?
094:07:40 Duke (LM onboard): Umm, that feels good.
094:07:46 Young (LM onboard): A-choo.
094:07:47 Duke (LM onboard): Oh, boy.
094:08:35 Duke (LM onboard): Can't understand why we're down to 91 percent on the Descent O2. Both tanks.
094:08:49 Young (LM onboard): They didn't fill them.
094:08:50 Duke (LM onboard): You don't think so?
094:08:51 Young (LM onboard): Yeah.
094:08:54 Duke (LM onboard): They never told me they weren't going to.
094:09:00 Young (LM onboard): That may be what it reads.
094:09:26 Duke (LM onboard): 13 minutes to AOS. Or thereabouts.
094:09:52 Young (LM onboard): Is Ken pulling latches?
094:09:56 Duke (LM onboard): Hey, Ken.
094:09:57 Mattingly (LM onboard): Yeah.
094:09:58 Duke (LM onboard): You all finished? I'm gonna close the hatch.
094:09:59 Mattingly (LM onboard): Wait a minute.
094:10:00 Duke (LM onboard): Okay.
094:10:05 Young (LM onboard): Is he off comm?
094:10:09 Duke (LM onboard): I don't know.
094:10:10 Young (LM onboard): Don't close the hatch until he gets on comm.
094:10:21 Duke (LM onboard): This zero gravity is so neat.
094:10:23 Young (LM onboard): Hey, Ken.
094:10:50 Mattingly (LM onboard): [Garble].
094:10:52 Duke (LM onboard): Okay. I've checked the exterior. The capture latches are engaged and locked, I got three good ones. And from my side, they're removed, the lock lever's engaged and flush; so we're all set.
094:11:17 Mattingly (LM onboard): [Garble].
094:11:22 Duke (LM onboard): Can you hear me on the comm, Ken?
094:11:24 Mattingly (LM onboard): Yeah, loud and clear.
094:11:25 Duke (LM onboard): Okay.
094:11:27 Young (LM onboard): Yeah, it is, T.K. If you go to Min Deadband Attitude hold and give me a [Verb] 06 [Noun] 20, I'd appreciate it.
094:11:39 Mattingly (LM onboard): Okay. I'll get with it right now.
094:11:42 Duke (LM onboard): Okay, Ken. I'm gonna close the hatch. We'll see you in 3 days, babe.
094:11:47 Mattingly (LM onboard): Okay.
094:11:48 Duke (LM onboard): And don't run off and leave us.
094:12:04 Young (LM onboard): You want me to check and see if it's sealed? Want me to check the seal and see if there's anything in it before you close it? There was nothing in it, huh ?
094:12:17 Duke (LM onboard): Huh-uh.
094:12:32 Young (LM onboard): Got it, huh?
094:12:33 Duke (LM onboard): Uh-huh. Going Auto, Press Reg A A -
094:12:40 Mattingly (LM onboard): Okay, John. I'm in Min Dead Band.
094:12:43 Young (LM onboard): Okay. And give me an 06 20.
094:12:53 Mattingly (LM onboard): Okay. Plus 002.74, plus 109.36, plus 004.57.
094:13:12 Young (LM onboard): Okay. Okay. Plus zero - plus 002.74, plus 109.36, plus 004.57.
094:13:23 Mattingly (LM onboard): That's affirmative.
094:14:01 Duke (LM onboard): Did you get the docking angle written down, John?
094:14:03 Young (LM onboard): It's minus 3-1/2.
094:14:04 Duke (LM onboard): Yeah. Just like in the training units. These -
094:14:13 Young (LM onboard): What?
094:14:14 Duke (LM onboard): These helmet - these helmet bags, the plate - the - the snap caved in over here and you can't get it snapped.
094:14:37 Young (LM onboard): There. Okay, Charlie. If you got some time, I'd like for you to check me on these angles.
094:14:42 Duke (LM onboard): Okay, just a minute.
094:15:26 Young (LM onboard): [Garble]. Hey, Ken. You've got to stay in Min Dead Band Att hold until I tell you.
094:15:31 Mattingly (LM onboard): Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.
094:16:03 Young (LM onboard): Charlie, you gonna put your foot on the...
094:16:07 Duke (LM onboard): The hatch?
094:16:08 Young (LM onboard): Yeah. (Laughter)
094:16:19 Duke (LM onboard): Plus 002.74, huh?
094:16:21 Young (LM onboard): Yeah...
094:16:22 Duke (LM onboard): Minus - subtract that. That'll be 6 - that one's correct. 289.36. That one is correct. This is wrong here. 360 minus should be a 370 something.
094:16:48 Young (LM onboard): You got 340 - Yeah, that's a minus.
094:16:50 Duke (LM onboard): 356.
094:16:51 Young (LM onboard): 356, yeah. (Laughter) 356...
094:16:58 Duke (LM onboard): No, it's 355.43.
094:17:00 Young (LM onboard): 355.43.
094:17:03 Duke (LM onboard): Now add that up again and make sure it makes 360.
094:17:06 Young (LM onboard): Yeah. Seven and three is ten; five and four is 9, ten, five and four is nine, 101 there we go.
094:17:13 Duke (LM onboard): Okay. Okay. Closed and secured hatch.
094:17:28 Young (LM onboard): Plus 293.76 Enter, plus 289.36 Enter, plus 355.43.
094:17:47 Duke (LM onboard): You did the self-test already, huh, John?
094:17:48 Young (LM onboard): Oh, yeah.
094:17:49 Duke (LM onboard): Okay.
094:17:51 Young (LM onboard): Okay. Plus 293.76, plus 289.36, plus 355.43. Go. Go get them, tiger. Okay.
094:18:14 Duke (LM onboard): Should be 0, 284, and 060.
094:18:22 Young (LM onboard): Yeah, you - he - he was out of attitude, wasn't he?
094:18:25 Duke (LM onboard): Oh, that's right. Yeah.
094:18:27 Young (LM onboard): Okay. Verb 40 Noun 20.
094:18:38 Duke (LM onboard): Maybe you ought to wait until that No Att light goes out.
094:18:40 Young (LM onboard): It ain't gonna ever go out.
094:18:41 Duke (LM onboard): Oh, that's right. You got to release. You're right. Not until you do that, it won't go out.
094:18:51 Young (LM onboard): Now, they said they're gonna change the REFSMMAT, right ?
094:19:00 Duke (LM onboard): Why, what do you want to do?
094:19:01 Young (LM onboard): [Garble].
094:19:06 Duke (LM onboard): You can still set the REFSMMAT flag.
094:19:14 Young (LM onboard): Yeah, I don't see why not.
094:19:19 Duke (LM onboard): Okay. Noun 07 Enter.
094:19:25 Young (LM onboard): Enter, 77 Enter, 10000 Enter, 1 Enter.
094:19:41 Duke (LM onboard): Did you - did you check that REFSMMAT?
094:19:46 Young (LM onboard): No. I'll check it in a second.
094:19:47 Duke (LM onboard): Okay.
094:19:57 Young (LM onboard): It's set.
094:19:58 Duke (LM onboard): Okay.
094:20:03 Young (comm): Okay, Ken. I need an 06 20. On my - on my mark.
094:20:18 Mattingly (comm): Okay. Standing by.
094:20:19 Young (comm): 3, 2, 1...
094:20:21 Young (comm): Mark.
094:20:22 Duke (LM onboard): Okay. 94:20:20.
094:20:24 Mattingly (comm): 002.69, plus 109.31, plus 004.72.
094:20:38 Young (LM onboard): Plus 002.69, plus 109.31, plus 004.72.
094:20:43 Mattingly (comm): That's affirmative.
094:20:50 Duke (LM onboard): You read out - read mine to me, John.
094:20:53 Young (LM onboard): 294.65, 289.96, 355.02.
094:21:03 Duke (LM onboard): Okay. I got it. All down in here.
094:21:07 Young (LM onboard): Okay. What time was it, Charlie?
094:21:09 Duke (LM onboard): 94:20:20.
094:21:16 Duke (LM onboard): Should have AOS momentarily. You've done the landing gear. Did the DAP.
094:21:29 Young (LM onboard): What else can we do, Charlie?
094:21:31 Duke (LM onboard): Nothing. Let's just wait until we get AOS and get the comm up. Then we do the E-memory dump.
094:21:39 Young (LM onboard): Okay.
094:21:40 Duke (LM onboard): We got to get an up-link. Then we can start into the RCS, after I get the Ascent Bats checked out.
Short CM transcript portion from 094:21:59 until 094:22:15.
094:22:00 Young (comm): Ken, are we pretty close to being at the undocking attitude?
094:22:02 Mattingly (CM comm): Undocking attitude is 01 plus 40.
094:22:11 Duke (LM onboard): Yeah, we're pretty close.
094:22:15 Young (CM onboard): Okay.
Break in CM transcript until 095:28:35.
094:22:20 Duke (LM onboard): What time did they say AOS was, Ken?
094:22:23 Young (LM onboard): The reason I ask, Ken, is for this P52, I need to be close to the right attitude to pick up the stars.
094:22:35 Mattingly (LM onboard): It's the same set of timeline procedures we've been using.
094:22:40 Young (LM onboard): I know it. It's just that it's further off on the 8-ball than normal.
094:22:45 Mattingly (LM onboard): Is that gonna be close enough, John?
094:22:49 Duke (LM onboard): Yeah. I think...
094:22:50 Young (LM onboard): Oh, let's try it and see what happens.
094:22:54 Duke (LM onboard): Okay. We just got them.
094:22:56 Mattingly (LM onboard): Charlie, [garble] AOS any second.
