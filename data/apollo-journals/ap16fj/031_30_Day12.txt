This is Apollo Control through 283 hours, 58 minutes [259:11] Ground Elapsed Time. One minute away from wakeup call. Spacecraft Communicator Tony England, standing by for good antenna swing by on the spacecraft before making his reveille call. Apollo 16, [now] 45,306 miles out from Earth. Velocity building up fairly rapidly now, [at] 9,174 feet per second. When Apollo 16 enters the atmosphere, some 6 hours and 24 minutes from now, it will be travelling four times as fast as it is now. We have confirmation of the High Gain locked in. Here goes Tony England.
The PAO, Mission Control and Crew are using the updated GET, intended to align events to the Flight Plan. At this stage in the flight, the difference from the actual GET is 24 hours, 45 minutes and 52 seconds. See here for more details.
259:15:18 England: Good morning, Apollo 16.
259:15:42 England: Good morning, good morning up there.
259:15:53 Young: Good morning, good morning down there.
259:16:15 England: Well, we see on this biomed that old Charlie woke up. He was really sawing away there.
259:16:28:Young: Charlie was sawing away on his biomed?
259:16:30 England: Sure was.
259:16:33 Young: I wouldn't be surprised. That's probably why it doesn't work. Termites do the same thing.
259:20:00 England: Apollo 16, Houston. Would you switch your High Gain to Medium?
259:20:14 Young: Yeah, Medium on the High Gain.
259:20:17 England: Okay.
259:33:45 England: Apollo 16, Houston.
259:33:51 Young: Go ahead. Over.
259:33:52 England: Okay. We've only got one minor change to your Flight Plan. Some high gain angles for a P52 at 285:48 when you want them.
259:34:13 Young: Okay. Go ahead.
259:34:14 England: Okay. Pitch, minus 28; Yaw, 96. And Stu will be in, in a little while, to talk about changes to your Entry Checklist. But that should do it for the Flight Plan. All your systems looked nominal through the night. We don't know about the Mid-Course 7 yet. Right now, you're in the corridor and it looks - it looks pretty good - like maybe you won't have to do one. If you did one, it wouldn't be any more than a foot and a half.
259:34:48 Young: Understand.
259:34:54 England: You're just slightly shallow. Give you a little softer ride.
259:35:17 England: And could you go Wide on the High Gain, please?
259:35:29 Young: High Gain, Wide.
259:35:31 England: Thank you.
259:36:02 Griffin: 16, Houston.
259:36:07 Young: Go ahead, Over.
259:36:08 Griffin: Hey, John. This is Gold Flight. We're going to be handing over down here shortly and our last shift with you - We wanted to let you know that we really commend you for a job well done and be looking forward to seeing you when you get back to Houston.
259:36:24 Young: Okay, Gold Flight. I tell you, we certainly enjoyed you, particularly on that descent. That was something else, wasn't it?
259:36:31 Griffin: It was a pretty long day. I'm sure it was for you. It sure was for us.
259:36:36 Young: Yeah, you bet.
259:36:44 Duke: Gerry, thanks for everything. We'll be seeing you when we get back.
259:36:47 Griffin: Okay, Charlie.
259:36:59 England: Incidentally, I talked to Lee [Silver] yesterday, and he sends you all a 'Very well done.'
259:37:08 Young: Thank you.
259:39:35 Mattingly: Tony, you still there?
259:39:37 England: Yeah. Go ahead.
259:39:40 Mattingly: Would you have your friend on the left take a look at my biomed?
259:39:45 England: Okay. He says you look healthy.
259:39:56 Mattingly: Okay. Thank you.
259:40:19 England: Incidentally, I think Lee's comments really mean you passed the course. I hope so anyway.
259:40:40 Duke: If we didn't, we'd like to go back and try again.
259:40:44 England: That would be a good deal, wouldn't it?
259:40:47 Young: Yeah, maybe you can fix that up for us so we can go back and try it again.
259:40:55 Duke: There's another 400 or 500 pounds up there, Tony, we'd like to bring you.
259:41:05 Young: We didn't make Lee's ton a year, but we're working on it.
259:41:10 England: [Laughter.] Yeah, if you don't get a - get a ton - Lee's going to be disappointed. No, I don't think so. I think he's pretty happy.
259:51:02 Young: Okay, Houston. With the crew status report.
259:51:07 England: Go ahead.
259:51:08 Young: Okay. For the Commander, A1 is still stowed, A3 is 7 hours, A4 is none, A5 is 1725 ...
259:51:45 England: John, we lost comm there about the CDR's A-5. If you can do that one again, please.
259:51:52 Young: Okay. A-5: 17, 25, and 16; A-6 is: 1 is 8, 2 is 4, 3 is 6, 4 is 5, and 5 is 8. All those - all those quantities are in ounces.
259:52:13 England: Okay.
259:52:22 Young: CMP: B-1, 15072; B-3, 6 hours; B-4, none - B-2 is 40 and 50. B-6: 1 is 5 ounces; 2 is 6 ounces; 3, 5 ounces; 4, 5 ounces.
259:52:58 England: Okay.
259:52:59 Young: On the LMP: C-1, 21180; C-3, 7 hours; C-4, none; C-5, 18, 25, 15; C-6: 5 ounces - number 1 is 5 ounces, number 2 is 7 ounces.
259:53:28:England: Okay. We copy that.
259:53:39 Young: Okay, back to the - to the chow. Yesterday, we were working on Day 11 food, and we - For the CDR Meal A, scratch the coffee with K; meal B, scratch the rye bread, change the tuna spread to 2/3, and change the - change the tuna spread from tuna spread to ham salad, and change the cocoa with K to citrus beverage with K.
259:54:28:England: Okay.
259:54:31 Young: And on Meal C, scratch the romaine soup and the pecans, and add ½ tuna salad.
259:54:46 England: Okay.
259:54:54 Young: On the CMP: for breakfast, scratch the grits; Meal B, scratch the grapefruit bar and the graham crackers; Meal C, substitute ham for beef steak, scratch the chicken and rice, scratch the pecans, scratch the grape drink, add orange-pineapple drink, gingerbread.
259:55:53 Young: And also an orange-grapefruit drink.
259:56:01 England: Okay.
259:56:19 Young: And on the LMP: for breakfast, scratch the bacon squares from Meal A; Meal B, scratch the lobster bisque, and the rye - and the rye bread. Wait a second here, somebody's got a little disagreement on what we ate here. It's not, incidentally, the first time that that's happened.
259:57:17 England: We'd like you to get started toward that galactic anti-centerpoint attitude, whatever that is.
259:57:59 Young: Okay, we're going that way.
259:58:00 England: Okay.
259:58:18 Young: Okay, let's start over on Meal B for the LMP.
259:58:23 England: All right.
259:58:24 Young: I've been correc - I've been corrected here. Do not scratch the lobster bisque. And substitute for tuna spread, ham spread. And do not scratch the rye bread. Scratch the cherry fruit bar, and the citrus beverage with K, and substitute the cocoa with K.
259:58:57 England: Okay.
259:58:58 Young: On Meal C, scratch the beef steak, scratch the fruitcake and the pecans, and add tuna salad, ¾ of a tin.
259:59:16 England: Okay, got it.
259:59:22 Young: Okay, and the injector valve temps are looking as follows: 5C, 4.5; 5D, 4.6; 6A, 4.1; 6B, 4.4; 6C, 4.9; 6D, 4.4. Which means no heatup.
259:59:51 England: Okay, copy that.
260:02:06 England: Apollo 16, we'd like Auto on the High Gain.
260:02:15 Young: You have it.
260:02:40 England: Hey, fellows. Hank's here, and have a good ride in. We'll see you in a couple of days.
260:02:47 Young: Okay. Thank you much, Tony.
260:02:50 England: You betcha.
260:02:53 Mattingly: We'll see you, and we enjoyed working with you, Tony.
260:02:57 England: Thank you.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 285 hours [260:13] Ground Elapsed Time. We now show Apollo 16 at a distance of 39,820 nautical miles away from the Earth. The velocity now reads 9,807 feet per second and in the Mission Control Center in Houston, we've had a shift changeover. Phil Shaffer is now our Flight Director. Our Capcom is now Henry Hartsfield. We're at 285 hours [260:13] Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
(NO COMM FOR 23 MINUTES)
260:25:46 Mattingly: Okay. We just got her again.
260:25:52 Hartsfield: Roger. Copy.
260:26:30 Mattingly: And, Houston; this time we've got the ISS light on and it's remaining on.
260:26:34 Hartsfield: Roger. Copy, Ken.
260:27:08 Mattingly: Program alarm was resettable, as you probably noticed.
260:27:13 Hartsfield: Roger. And you - But you still have the light, is that affirmative?
260:27:17 Mattingly: That's affirmative.
260:27:18 Young: Affirmative.
260:28:13 Mattingly: Okays, Houston, could we proceed through Malfunction Number 6 here?
260:28:24 Hartsfield: They're debating that, Ken. Just a second.
260:28:28:Mattingly: Okay. The Noun 20s check with the FDAI very closely.
260:28:41 Hartsfield: Okay. Ken, why don't you press on through that malfunction 6 there on Page 28; and remember, if you get down to box 12, you have to kill the DAP.
260:28:53 Mattingly: Okay.
260:29:24 Hartsfield: Do you have any questions on killing the DAP, Ken?
260:29:28:Mattingly: No, sir.
260:29:50 Mattingly: Okay, that time when I went to do a Verb 40, just about the time it should have run its time out and blanked the DSKY, we got another Program Alarm, and a - shows 3777 again.
260:30:06 Hartsfield: Roger, [garble] that.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 285 hours, 16 minutes [260:29] Ground Elapsed Time. You heard the report from Ken Mattingly. We have a recurrence of yesterday's Program Alarm, this the Inertial Sub-System warning light on. At this point, however, the light remains on. We'll stand by and continue to monitor. We show Apollo 16 at a distance of 38,327 nautical miles away from Earth, now travelling at a speed of 10,000 feet per second.
260:30:47 Hartsfield: Do you still have the ISS light, Ken?
260:30:51 Mattingly: That's affirmative.
260:32:13 Hartsfield: 16, Houston. We'd like to proceed with the malfunction procedure.
260:32:19 Mattingly: Okay. Would you like to do Block 6 again?
260:32:31 Hartsfield: Stand by, Ken. They're looking at it. There's speculation we've got a - the fail bit set and stuck there.
260:33:17 Hartsfield: Okay, Ken. Let's proceed with Block 6 and go on down to 12, and - but I think we're gonna see the same thing all over again, but let's try it.
260:33:26 Mattingly: You say skip Block 6?
260:33:28:Hartsfield: Negative. Let's do back - Block 6 again.
Block 6 is the malfunction procedure which was followed yesterday when a similar kind of problem developed. We're at 285 hours, 20 minutes [260:33] Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
260:33:33 Mattingly: Okay.
260:33:51 Mattingly: Same thing, Hank.
260:33:53 Hartsfield: Okay, understand.
260:34:35 Mattingly: Okay, Hank. I'm not sure how to answer Block 6. I'll go to Block 12 if you like.
260:34:41 Hartsfield: Stand by a minute, Ken.
260:35:28:Hartsfield: Okay, Ken. We can see that input channel bit, and it's set, and it's staying set, so we think there's no need to proceed any further.
260:35:38 Mattingly: Okay. Do you have any way of isolating whether it's - the bit is set or whether it's receiving continuous input?
260:35:47 Hartsfield: Okay. Everybody's looking at that now. We're trying to psych out what's going wrong here.
260:35:53 Mattingly: Okay. Thank you, sir.
260:40:47 Hartsfield: 16, Houston. It appears to us that the input channel bit just cleared. Did you do anything?
260:40:54 Mattingly: No, sir. And the ISS light is out.
260:41:45 Young: Let me tell you what the only thing we can think of that might have happened. Charlie's down in the LEB, and Tool E, it sounded like, got knocked against the Panel down there, if you can believe that.
260:42:03 Hartsfield: Tool E hit the panel and the light went away?
260:42:07 Young: That, we can't say that for sure. That's the only action that - that I can think of that was going on at the time.
260:42:16 Hartsfield: Roger.
260:42:17 Young: And I'm not even sure that was. I just heard a clank.
That's John Young speaking from Apollo 16, now. We're at 285 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. As you just heard the Program Alarm just cleared. However, if the alarm light persisted, this does not mean that the Apollo 16 can't use the guidance and navigation system for entry. But if another problem developed with the Inertial Sub-System, we would not get the ISS alarm. What Apollo 16 would really be giving up would be an ISS fail indication, but we would receive a gimbal lock alarm or indication if this developed. We're at 285 hours, 30 minutes [260:43] Ground Elapsed Time. We show Apollo 16 at a distance of 37,095 nautical miles away from the Earth, and travelling at a velocity of 10,168 feet per second.
260:44:04 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Houston. We would like to get on with the activity at 285:30 regarding the SIM bay. However, we would like to leave the Gamma Ray Shield on. We don't want to take it Off.
260:44:19 Mattingly: Okay.
260:50:11 Hartsfield: Ken, looks like the Gamma Ray Boom is not gonna come in any further; we've seen it stalled. But it is safe for - with a safe position. You can go ahead and turn the Boom switch to Off. And for planning purposes, we are gonna do a Mid-Course 7, and it's about 1½ feet per second.
260:50:28:Mattingly: Okay, thank you.
260:50:29 Young: Okay.
260:50:30 Mattingly: We'll turn the Gamma Ray Boom to Off.
260:51:36 Mattingly: Hank, do you folks want us to go ahead and try the 52?
260:51:48 Hartsfield: Roger, Ken. We'd like to do the P52, and since the problem's cleared up, I imagine you can use the Verb 49 maneuver.
260:51:56 Mattingly: We'll certainly give that a try. Hank, do we have the entry REFSMMAT plugged in yet?
260:52:18 Hartsfield: Stand by.
260:52:40 Hartsfield: If you'll give us Accept, we'll pump your loads up to you.
260:52:47 Mattingly: Okay, you have it.
260:53:03 Hartsfield: We're sending you a state vector, a target load, and a REFSMMAT.
260:55:20 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Houston. I have your MCC-7 PAD.
260:56:02 Young: Okay, go ahead, Hank.
260:56:03 Hartsfield: Roger. MCC-7, RCS/G&N; 27276; Noun 48 is NA; Noun 33, 287:23:00.26; minus 0001.4, plus all zips, plus four balls 1; 180, 310, 000; HA is NA, plus 0021.7; 0001.4, 0:04, 0001.4; sextant star 13, 312.7, 33.7; boresight star NA; Noun 61, minus 00.71, minus 156.18; 1045.8, 36276; 290:23:59. Sirius and Rigel; 279, 045, 014. Four jets. Remarks: EMS not bias for drift. High Gain angles, Pitch, minus 85; Yaw, 119. End of PAD, and the computer is yours.
260:58:17 Young: Okay. MCC-7, RCS/G&N; 27276; Noun 48 not applicable; 287:23:00.26; minus three balls 1.4, plus all balls, plus 0000.1; 180, 310, 000; HA is not applicable, 21.7; Delta-VT 1.4, burn time 4 seconds, Delta VC 1.4; 13 sextant star, 312.7, 33.7; latitude minus 7.1, longitude minus 156.18; 1045.8, 36276; 290:23:59. Sirius and Rigel; 279, 045, and 014. Four Jets, plus-X. EMS not bias for drift. Pitch on High Gain, minus 85; Yaw, 119 - minus 119.
260:59:40 Hartsfield: That's a good readback, John, except the Noun 61, the latitude is 0.71, minus 0.71.
260:59:58 Young: Okay, 0.71.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 285 hours 46 minutes [260:59] Ground Elapsed Time. You heard John Young aboard Apollo, 16 responding to the Mid-Course maneuver Number 7 PAD which was just passed up to him by CapCom Hank Hartsfield. MCC-7 is scheduled for ignition at 287 hours, 23 minutes [and] 27 - or 26 seconds Ground Elapsed Time with a Delta V of 1.4 feet per second, a burn duration of 4 seconds.
261:00:20 Hartsfield: Omni Charlie, Apollo 16.
261:00:28:Young: You have Charlie.
261:01:03 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Houston. We're clear to turn the Data System Off down on Panel 230.
261:01:09 Mattingly: Okay.
261:01:24 Mattingly: Hank, did you copy my question about post-torque versus coarse align for the REFSMMAT change?
261:01:30 Hartsfield: Negative, Ken. But I'll check it.
261:01:31 Mattingly: Okay. That's in light of these funnies. I'd hate to have it - end up losing all track of what it's doing.
261:01:40 Hartsfield: Roger.
The reason for such a small Mid-Course 7 burn is to target the Service Module away from an island in the landing footprint. Also this will further fine tune the entry angle. Because we feel assured of - we feel assured of doing this because of an ability to realign the platform. This capability exists even if we did have a recurrence of the Program Alarm, which we saw earlier this morning. We now show Apollo 16 at a distance of 35,296 nautical miles away from the Earth and travelling at a speed of 10,425 feet per second.
261:02:01 Hartsfield: Omni Delta.
261:02:17 Mattingly: Omni Delta.
261:02:21 Hartsfield: Roger.
261:02:33 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Houston. Normal procedures on the P52 coarse align.
261:02:39 Mattingly: Okay. Thank you, sir.
261:04:50 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Omni Alpha.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 285 hours, 53 minutes [261:06] Ground Elapsed Time. Based on that Mid-Course Correction number 7 PAD we have the following times to pass along. Time of entry into the Earth's atmosphere, 290 hours, 23 minutes [and] 32 seconds [265:37:30] Ground Elapsed Time; Retro Elapsed Time to [0.]05g, 27 seconds; Retro Elapsed Time to begin blackout, 16 seconds; Retro Elapsed Time to end blackout; 3 minutes, 33 seconds; Retro Elapsed Time to time of drogue chute deployment, 7 minutes, 43 seconds; Retro Elapsed Time to time of main chute deployment, 8 minutes, 29 seconds; and retro elapsed to splash 13 minutes, 21 seconds.
We also indicate a max g load on the crew of Apollo 16 with this entry path at 6.87 gs.
261:09:17 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Houston. Have a Entry PAD for you.
261:09:23 Mattingly: Okay. Just a second, Henry.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 285 hours, 57 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The name of the island which initially would have been in the footprint of the Service Module had we had not chosen to do Mid-Course Correction 7 is Penrhyn. It was [a] B-29 base during World-War II. There's some 500 to 600 inhabitants on the island and it's chief export is pearl shell. We're at 285 hours, 58 minutes [261:12] Ground Elapsed Time. We now show Apollo 16 at a distance of 34,346 nautical miles away from the Earth and travelling at a speed of 10,568 feet per second.
261:11:11 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, are you clear to torque?
261:14:34 Hartsfield: Clear to torque. And, 16; we're still standing by with that Entry PAD.
261:14:44 Young: Okay.
261:15:13 Hartsfield: And, 16; after we get this PAD up, Stu is gonna have some words for you about the checklist change.
261:15:26 Young: Okay. Go ahead with the PAD.
261:15:30 Hartsfield: Okay, MidPac; 000, 153, 000; 290:06:32. 267: minus 00.71, minus 156.18; 06.9; 36196, 6.50; 1045.8, 36276; 290:23:32; 00:27; Noun 69 is NA; 4.00, 02:02; 00:16, 03:33, 07:43; sextant star 25, 151.5, 26.2; boresight NA; lift vector UP.

261:19:32 Hartsfield: Good readback, John.
Apollo Control Houston at 286 hours 6 minutes [261:20] Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16, now 33,550 nautical miles away from the Earth, and now travelling at a velocity of 10,693 feet per second. You heard John Young taking down the Entry PAD as passed up by CapCom Hank Hartsfield. We repeat again the numbers. We expect in Ground Elapsed Time, Apollo 16 to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere at 290 hours, 23 minutes [and] 32 seconds [265:37:30]. The blackout period will begin at plus 16 seconds from entry interface. The blackout period will end at 3 minutes, 33 seconds from time of entry interface, main drogue chute deployment 7, minutes 43 seconds from time of entry interface. Main chute deployment 8 minutes, 29 seconds from time of entry interface, and splashdown predicted at 13 minutes, 21 seconds from time of entry interface. The velocity at time of entry into the Earth's atmosphere of 36,276 feet per second. We expect the crew of Apollo 16 to pull a max g load of 6.87. We're at 286 hours, 7 minutes [261:20] Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control Houston.
261:24:25 Roosa: 16, Houston.
261:24:29 Mattingly: Good morning, Stuart.
261:24:30 Roosa: Oh, jolly good, there. I - I've got a couple or three changes to your checklist and your cue card, if you want to fish those out.
261:24:41 Mattingly: Okay, got the cue card and an Entry Checklist.
261:24:45 Roosa: Okay, let's go to the Entry Checklist, Page E/1-2.
261:24:53 Mattingly: Okay, E/l-2. You're starting early in the book.
261:24:54 Roosa: Oh, Roger. Okay, let's go down here to the - the end of the logic sequence check.
261:25:06 Mattingly: Okay.
261:25:07 Roosa: Right after we've opened the SECS circuit breakers there, we want to write in "Battery compartment pressure check - Systems Test, 7-A. If off-scale high, open Vent Valve through entry."
261:25:41 Mattingly: Okay, battery compartment pressure check - that's meter 7-A. If off-scale high, open through entry - and, just for your information, right now it's about 2.9.
261:25:53 Roosa: Okay; copy. Okay, and then at the bottom of that page, after the P52, put in - I'm sorry - let's do it before the P52. Add "Start EMP 509." And this is just an arbitrary point that we've - that we've picked, Ken. We're getting close enough now that we think we ought to have 509 running. We would prefer you to go ahead and do the P52 in SCS, as you have been doing. But let's just have 509 running before you go into that P52.
261:26:38 Mattingly: Okay, that's fair.
261:26:40 Roosa: Okay, let's go over to 1-3 and ...
261:26:44 Mattingly: All right.
261:26:45 Roosa: Down under the boresight - this is the standard bit - delete your "Verb 41 Noun 91," and add "Verb 16 Noun 91 Enter; use Manual Optics."
261:26:59 Mattingly: Okay, Manual on the boresight.
261:27:01 Roosa: Okay. And now, after you drive the Optics to 90 degrees, we want to delete the Optics power, off. And we want to verify Optics Speed, Lo. And we're going to leave the Optics power on and, here in the mysterious world of glitches, this is going to minimize the probability. So we're gonna come in with it on, and we'll put the Speed to Lo just to hold down the drift.
261:27:36 Mattingly: Okay, after the 90-degree shaft, why, we'll - delete Optics power off and verify that the Speed is Lo.
261:27:45 Roosa: Okay, now let's go to 2-2. Thank you. I need to be looking at this instead of that.
261:27:53 Mattingly: Okay, 2-2.
261:27:57 Roosa: Okay. Now, after we get down to - after the P61 entry prep and prior to entering P61, we want to add - and the - what we're doing here, Ken, is we're resetting the average-g flag, which we set in 509. And if we do not do this step - now this is a - a pretty critical step - if we do not reset that average-g flag, P61 will not call average g. So our procedure here before we go into P61 is a Verb 25 Noun 7 Enter, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, Enter. And if for some reason P61 would not call up average g, your fastest and most obvious cue is that lack of the comp cycle before Noun 61 comes up. If you don't reset this, your Noun 61 comes up immediately, but - with 509 running, we've got to get this step in or we'll not pick up our average g.
261:29:15 Mattingly: Okay, That's a good one to know.
261:29:17 Roosa: Roger. And how about just reading that step back to me there.
261:29:21 Mattingly: Okay. Before calling P61, I'm going to reset the average-g flag with a Verb 25 Noun 7, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, and 0 Enter. And I'll do that prior to calling P61.
261:29:33 Roosa: Okay. Jolly good. And let's go over to 2-4.
261:29:40 Mattingly: Okay. On 2-4.
261:29:42 Roosa: Okay. And what we're doing here now is, after you have Pro and you activate the Entry DAP, at that time, your Noun 46 first digit is dropped to a zero. To reactivate EMP 509, after the flashing 06 61 comes up, let's insert in there a Verb 21 Noun 46 Enter, 30000 Enter. And, of course, all we're doing here is putting the 3 back in Noun 46 and this was dropped, as I say, when you went into the Entry DAP.
261:30:26 Mattingly: Okay. The - you want to do that after - Line 13, or before that?
261:30:32 Roosa: Okay. After line 13, in between the flashing 06 61 and before the PRO.
261:30:53 Mattingly: Okay. Stu, after flashing 61 and before Proceeding on that, we'll do a Verb 21 Noun 46, 30000 Enter.
261:31:06 Roosa: Roger. You'll do a Verb 21 Noun 46 Enter, 30000 Enter.
261:31:11 Mattingly: That's right.
261:31:13 Roosa: Okay. And you got the picture of why we're having to do that?
261:31:18 Mattingly: Yes, sir.
261:31:19 Roosa: Okay. Now the - now, if you'll pick up your cue card, we'll change it to the same things that we've just gone over in the checklist here.
261:31:30 Mattingly: Okay.
261:31:33 Roosa: Okay. Prior to your P61, add Verb 25 Noun 7 Enter, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, 0 Enter.
261:31:52 Mattingly: Okay. I'll reset that flag before P61.
261:31:57 Roosa: Okay. And, back down here in your P62 box, same thing we just talked about. Prior to the Pro, after the 06 61, add Verb 21 Noun 46 Enter, 30000 Enter.
261:32:19 Mattingly: Okay. Got that.
261:32:25 Roosa: Okay. And - got a - a change here to your Systems Checklist - and this is just changing to reflect the increased pressure in the battery compartment. If you'd like to change that, it's Page S/l-2, under Step 3.
261:33:23 Mattingly: Okay.
261:33:25 Roosa: Okay. Down - toward the bottom of the page, about three lines up, we've got a comment in there. "If greater than 1.5, Battery Vent valve, Vent." We want to change that 1.5 to 3.4.
261:33:55 Mattingly: Okay. We change that to 3.4.
261:33:58 Roosa: Okay. It's a pretty innocuous change. And the one - the line right above that, too - "Systems Test 7-A, battery compartment pressure less than 1.5," change that to 3.4, also.
261:34:09 Mattingly: Okay.
261:34:10 Roosa: Okay. Those are the changes, Ken. And - we're working up a - a list here. It'll be pretty straightforward. I don't want to give them to you now. We're massaging them - of the cues that will indicate to you - the CDU glitches just prior to and during the entry phase. And I'd like to talk to you about that in a little bit when we get all squared away.
261:34:38 Mattingly: Okay. Thank you.
261:34:40 Roosa: Roger. Oh, I'd like to also add here, Ken, and - of course, as you well know, we - in this mysterious glitch solutions, we gotta shotgun it, and we're trying to find the areas that are a prime candidate for glitch in the CDU. And one of these is during your GDC align procedure, when you have your Att Set switch to Att Set and you either switch in to or out of IMU on the Source. What you're doing here is loading up the CDU's, and they feel that this is a prime candidate for a glitch. So, our words of wisdom are to minimize the number of times that you use this switch, and I guess after your GDC align in the normal checklist;, we'd kind of like to see you not cycle that Source switch to IMU with your Att Set switch in Att Set. I guess you could still check your GDC versus Noun 20s if you wanted to, but I did want you to be aware of this particular switch combination as - as loading up the CDU. And this is where we have the probability of glitches.
261:36:07 Mattingly: Okay, thank you.
261:36:09 Roosa: And just ...
261:36:10 Young: As you know, we've - we've only aligned the GDC IMU a thousand times, and I don't think that's had anything to do with the glitch we've had so far.
261:36:30 Roosa: Yeah, we realize that, John. The problem is - we don't know what - what's causing the glitch. We just, at this time, can't say.
261:36:31 Young: That's true, but I'm saying that - Oh, never mind, never mind.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 286 hours, 23 minutes [261:36] Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16 now 31,829 nautical miles away from the Earth. The velocity now reads 10,978 feet per second. We've heard Stu Roosa talking from the Capcom's console. Stu Roosa, the backup Command Module Pilot for Apollo 16. Meanwhile, the weather forecast for the planned landing area located about 1,200 miles south of Hawaii calls for scattered clouds, cloud coverage 2,000 feet scattered, easterly winds, 10 knots, 3 foot seas, visibility at 10 nautical miles and temperature near 82 degrees. Our current predicted splash coordinates based on Mid-Course Correction 7 and our entry angle [is] 44 minutes south, 156 degrees, 11 minutes west. We're at 286 hours, 24 minutes [261:37] Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
261:46:39 Mattingly: Houston, 16.
261:46:44 Hartsfield: Go ahead.
261:46:47 Mattingly: You folks have any objections if we pump up the cabin to about 5.7 now so we can have full packages and have a little pad on the cabin pressure? The regs are running a little low.
261:47:04 Hartsfield: Okay. Go ahead, Ken.
261:47:09 Mattingly: Thank you.
Apollo Control Houston. 286 hours, 43 minutes [261:56] Ground Elapsed Time. We're now some 40 minutes from time of ignition for Mid-Course burn number 7. This is scheduled to occur at 287 hours, 23 minutes 27 - 26 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. A very small maneuver with a Delta V of 1.4 feet per second, and burn duration of 4 seconds. We now show Apollo 16 at 29,686 nautical miles away from the Earth, and travelling at a speed of 11,359 feet per second. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
261:58:01 Hartsfield: Ken, it all looks good down here. We don't think you need the Verb 40.
261:58:07 Mattingly: Okay. I agree. Sure gets your attention, though.
261:58:13 Hartsfield: Roger.
261:58:26 Hartsfield: Wait a couple hours, Ken, and it'll even get your attention faster. And when all of you've got a chance to listen, I've got a couple of words on the - on the CDU transient fuse [?].
261:58:43 Mattingly: Okay. Why don't you wait a few minutes. We're still cleaning up a little stowage here.
261:58:48 Hartsfield: Okay.
No comms for 15 minutes.
262:13:11 Young: Well, here we go again.
262:13:13 Hartsfield: Roger. We see it.
This is Apollo Control Houston. 286 hours, 59 minutes [262:12] Ground Elapsed Time. We've seen a recurrence of the Program Alarm light. That was the reference just made. The light is out now reports Guidance. We're at 287 hours [262:13] -
262:13:47 Young: Okay, Houston. I got it out that time by kicking the panel. Sounds to me like switch - it sounds to me like same kind of contamination in the - in the switch.
262:14:00 Hartsfield: Where ...
262:14:01 Young: In the relay or whatever.
262:14:03 Hartsfield: Where did you kick, John?
262:14:07 Young: I kicked right - I put my - I - when it went out, I was kicking right over the Noun 99 codes, and just below that - I think it was ...
262:14:19 Mattingly: [garble] LEB and the ...
262:14:20 Young: Yeah, I think I was ...
262:14:21 Mattingly: ... Optics panel.
262:14:22 Young: ... kicking on the region of the - What's just below there, the PSA with the modules in it?
262:14:29 Hartsfield: All right. Maybe there was something to that Tool E hitting it awhile ago.
262:14:34 Young: Could have been. Or maybe it just went out.
That was John Young reporting on his remedy for putting the light out. The Apollo 16 is returned to it's primary guidance and navigation system. And systems look good here in the Mission Control at this time. We show Apollo 16 at a distance of 27,779 nautical miles away from the Earth, and travelling at a speed of 11,725 feet per second. We're at 287 hours, 1 minute [262:13] Ground Elapsed Time. This is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 287 hours 10 minutes [262:23] Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16 now 13 minutes away from time of ignition for Mid-Course Correction number 7. The onboard computer is now is Program 41. This is the reaction control system program which provides a computation for a preferred platform orientation and preferred vehicle attitude for the thrusting maneuver, and the maneuvers the vehicle to the proper thrusting attitude. We now show Apollo 16 at a distance of 26,749 nautical miles away from the Earth and with the velocity of 11,939 feet per second. [At] 287 hours, 11 minutes [262:24] Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
262:27:38 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Houston. We'd like to verify the S-Band Aux TV switch, Off.
262:27:48 Young: You want it -
262:28:01 Young: Okay, it's verified Off now.
262:28:03 Hartsfield: Okay, thank you.
262:32:29 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Houston. You're Go for Mid-Course 7.
262:32:34 Young: Roger. Go for 7.
Flight Director Phil Shaffer having taken a Go/No-Go for Mid-Course 7 passed it along the CapCom Henry Hartsfield, who in turn, passed it along to the crew. We're 4 minutes 9 seconds away from time of ignition and we show Apollo 16 at a distance of 25,815 nautical miles away from the Earth and travelling at a speed of 12,143 feet per second.
Apollo Control, Houston. Two minutes away now from time of ignition for Mid-Course Correction 7.
262:36:25 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, I request your Key Release.
262:36:29 Mattingly: It'll - clear up at average g.
262:37:34 Young: Okay, burn's complete. Residuals, plus 0.1, minus 0, plus 1 or plus - Yeah.
262:37:43 Hartsfield: Roger; copy.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 287 hours 24 minutes [262:37] Ground Elapsed Time. You heard John Young report that the Mid-Course Correction 7 burn has been completed. We copied time of ignition at 24 seconds beyond the scheduled time. This a very minimal burn providing a Delta V of 1.4 feet per second.
Apollo Control, Houston, 287 hours, 25 minutes [262:38] Ground Elapsed Time.
262:39:04 Mattingly: Okay. I'm maneuvering to the UV photo attitude.
262:39:09 Hartsfield: Roger.
Apollo 16 now being maneuvered to the ultraviolet photography attitude The fact that the burn occurred at 24 seconds beyond the scheduled time will have no effect on the entry corridor. We're at 287 hours 26 minutes [262:39] Ground Elapsed Time. We show Apollo 16 at a distance of 25,048 nautical miles away from the Earth travelling at a velocity of 12,316 feet per second. This is Apollo Control, Houston,
262:42:24 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Omni Delta.
262:45:45 Hartsfield: 16, Houston.
262:45:48 Mattingly: Hello there.
262:45:50 Hartsfield: Roger. Just a little info. We're gonna be - we'll give you a call, but we'll be bringing the batteries on at EI minus 45, about 15 minutes early, just so we'll have a little extra time to take a look at them.
262:46:07 Mattingly: Okay.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 287 hours, 32 minutes [262:45] Ground Elapsed Time. We now show Apollo 16 at a distance of 24,294 nautical miles out from the Earth and travelling at a velocity of 12,495 feet per second. The 24-second delayed ignition time on Mid-Course correction number 7 will have no effect on the entry corridor. Rather Ken Mattingly had not finished sequencing out his program for the burn, this Program number 41 on the computer. The RCS systems - and Flight Dynamics reports, based on his present trajectory plotting, an entry angle of minus 6.48 degrees. We're at 287 hours, 33 minutes [262:46] Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
262:51:06 Mattingly: Houston, we've got the UV camera all set up. And it looks like we're pointing at the Earth. How about if we go ahead and take this - UV sequence now, instead of waiting until 55.
262:51:19 Hartsfield: Stand by.
262:52:05 Hartsfield: Ken, you can go ahead with the photos.
262:52:09 Mattingly: Okay. Thank you.
262:54:34 Mattingly: Houston, we're going around the closeout panels and we're down here around 382 and - are you happy with the mixing valve position or are you going to want to change it before we close it out?
262:54:47 Hartsfield: I'll get you an answer on that, Ken.
262:54:58 Hartsfield: Looks like a good setting, Ken.
262:55:02 Mattingly: Okay, we're going to close out the panel.
(NO COMM FOR 15 MINUTES)
263:10:31 Mattingly: Houston, you're gonna give us another Entry PAD after you work this Mid-Course for a while, aren't you?
263:10:39 Hartsfield: That's affirmative. Be about another hour and 20 minutes.
263:10:43 Mattingly: Okay.
263:10:54 Hartsfield: And, for planning purposes, we're gonna be bringing - like to bring the batteries on a little earlier. But we'll give you a cue on that. We just want to look at them since we had this venting problem.
263:11:06 Mattingly: Roger. Old battery vent is up to almost 3 now - 2.99.
263:11:17 Hartsfield: Roger.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 287 hours, 59 minutes [263:12] Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16 now 21,203 nautical miles away from the Earth and now travelling at a speed of 13,314 feet per second. We'll continue to monitor the air-ground for any conversations that develop between our CapCom console manned by Henry Hartsfield along with backup Command Module Pilot Stu Roosa and the crew of Apollo 16. At 287 hours, 59 minutes [263:12] Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
263:15:46 Young: Hank, we got the Earth out of Window 5. It's a very thin crescent and the subsolar point is - spectacularly bright.
263:15:59 Hartsfield: Sounds great.
263:16:01 Young: It looks great, I'll tell you.
263:16:10 Hartsfield: We show you a little - well, about 20,700 miles out now and about 13,400 feet per second.
263:16:21 Young: Starting to haul it in.
263:16:53 Mattingly: Houston, 16's ready for the Logic check, whenever you are.
263:17:07 Hartsfield: Stand by, Ken. We're getting a checkpoint here.
263:17:13 Mattingly: Okay.
263:17:44 Hartsfield: Okay, 16. Go ahead with the Logic check.
263:18:14 Mattingly: Okay. The Logic's coming on. Number 1, on; number 2 - that's - two Logics are on.
263:18:23 Hartsfield: Roger. You're Go for Pyro Arm, as required.
263:18:31 Mattingly: Thank you, sir.
263:18:43 Mattingly: Okay. Let's do that check, again.
263:18:49 Hartsfield: I understand you'd like to repeat?
263:18:52 Mattingly: Yes, please. Okay, now - the SECS/Logic is coming on now.
263:19:12 Hartsfield: It still looks good, 16.
263:19:15 Mattingly: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, now.
263:19:53 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Houston. We saw a C&W about the time you started the logic check. Were you testing the lights, or did you really get a warning there?
263:20:03 Mattingly: He was doing a light test.
263:20:05 Hartsfield: Roger. Copy.
263:20:18 Young: Okay, Houston. The battery compartment is reading about 3. So, according to the rules, we do not go to vent.
263:20:31 Hartsfield: Roger. That's - we concur.
263:21:48 Mattingly: Okay, Houston. We have EMP 509 loaded.
263:21:53 Hartsfield: Roger. Copy.
263:22:01 Mattingly: And we're going to hold onto P52 until we get down to the nominal time.
263:22:05 Hartsfield: Roger.
263:26:37 Roosa: Apollo 16, Houston.
263:26:41 Mattingly: Go ahead. Over.
263:26:44 Roosa: Okay. I don't know how you're coming along in your time line there. I would like to make a couple of comments if you've got time to listen. I don't think you want to copy anything at this point.
263:26:56 Mattingly: Okay. Looks like we're between - just before doing the P52. Go ahead, Stu.
263:27:04 Roosa: Okay. This deals with the - our favorite problem, of course, the - your ISS warning. And, right now, you people are doing all the right things and we're wanting to do those same procedures right through - right through entry when, of course, when ISS comes on, I'm sure you're going to go to Spacecraft Control, which you've been doing and you've been checking that alarm code. And we're saying that, if you have that 3 triple 7, to ignore it. Whe - it's - whether it needs it or not, just to keep the procedure straightforward, we - after you - while you're still in SCS, do a Verb 40 Enter and wait your 10 seconds, and go back to CMC. So, this means that we're saying - we'll come all the way in CMC with that 3 triple 7 alarm showing. If you do get a - if you do have a CDU failure, why, you will see it in your - in your bank angle - your - which is just your normal procedures there where you're looking at your commanded DSKY angle versus what the spacecraft is doing. Also, if you have got a glitch in the CDU, such as we got on the way out, and it's not the 90-degree bit - of course, if the 90-degree bit is set, you'll have the gimbal lock telling you that. And it's again the same old bit, SCS, Verb 40, wait 10 seconds, back to CMC. You can get some glitches, of course, in the CDUs that are not the 90-degree bit. I mean, there's a possibility of it. And, just some words on that - if - if the - if it's a low angle bit set, I say less than 30 degrees, you - it really does not affect your target point. I mean, we're talking in the order of being very close to nominal, within a mile or so. If - if the bit set is large enough for you to see it, comparing the - I mean if the bit set is gonna affect your splashdown point by any appreciable amount, you'll see it comparing your commanded angle versus where the spacecraft is going. So, that's your clue. And, if you see this and it's not looking right, we want you to go to SCS, do a Verb 40, and back to CMC to see if that solves the problem.
263:30:02 Mattingly: Okay. That all sounds reasonable.
263:30:05 Roosa: Okay. And I guess the - I guess this - about the only thing I'm saying, Ken, - that's any appreciable difference is this Verb 40 bit. I'm not used to doing that during the entry and I'd like to emphasize that if you're not - if it's looking funny and you're not sure, well, go ahead and do it. And, of course, as you well know, the needles will zero and the DAP will be off for 10 seconds, and you'll be back in business. There's one other point, and I'll admit this is - this stretching pretty - pretty thin, but we're trying to cover all the angles. If it's prior to P64, where you're going along - Of course, if you're in CMC control and you get a glitch, why you'll get the response from the DAP. If you're going along in SCS control and you get a glitch, why, your needles will go out. Now, you may have your pitch needle already pegged. So there's - here again, we might have a glitch in that pitch needle - in the pitch CDU and not know it. So, just one other recommendation is if your pitch needle doesn't come off the peg the way you like it, why, let's try a Verb 40 before we would say the - the G&N is not doing correctly.
263:31:25 Mattingly: Okay.
263:31:39 Roosa: And I guess that about takes care of it, Ken, John, unless you got any - Charlie, unless you got any questions. It'd probably be John punching up the - the alarm there and, if you do get the 3777, why, let's reset it and press ahead. And, of course, any of the other triple-7 alarms are - are valid. And - but, of course, it's the same old monitoring bit. You're going to see how she goes.
263:32:14 Mattingly: Okay, Stu. I think that's all pretty well understood. Thank you very much.
263:32:18 Roosa: Roger.
263:32:20 Young: Yes, Stu. We appreciate it.
263:32:22 Roosa: Okay.
263:32:23 Young: You've got to spend a lot of time learning about CDUs, I expect, huh?
263:32:27 Hartsfield: Hey, that's a favorite topic of discussion, now. CDUs and how do they glitch.
263:32:47 Mattingly: Houston, 16. Are we going to get another Entry PAD?
263:32:52 Hartsfield: That's affirmative. About an hour from now.
That was backup Command Module Pilot Stu Roosa talking to the crew of Apollo 16 going over procedures that they may desire to follow if they do see some irregularities in their guidance and navigation system in the final phases of entry. We now show Apollo 16 at an altitude of 18,635 nautical miles away from the Earth and travelling at a velocity of 14,113 feet per second. We show 2 hours, 4 minutes away from time of entry, and at 288 hours, 20 minutes [263:33] Ground Elapsed Time this is Apollo Control Houston.
263:33:50 Hartsfield: Apollo 16. Our first batch of tracking data shows you right in the groove, and we're gonna get another hours' worth of data and then give you your final PAD.
263:34:01 Young: Roger.

264:57:40 Young: Okay, we can verify that we had all engines.
265:05:12 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Houston. We gonna have to give you another Z PIPA bias and we'd like for you not to go into P61 until we get that in.
265:05:25 Young: Okay.
265:05:32 Young: We're in - do you want us to go to Accept now?
265:05:40 Hartsfield: Negative.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 289 hours, 52 minutes [265:05] of Ground Elapsed Time. Our last Manned Space Flight Network station prior to handover to the Apollo Ranging and Instrumentation aircraft is Honeysuckle. This handover will take place at 290 hours, 14 minutes [and] 32 seconds [265:28:30] Ground Elapsed Time, or approximately 9 minutes before time of Entry into the Earth's atmosphere. The Apollo Instrumentation and Ranging [sic] aircraft, this is a modified C-135, will provide the Mission Control Center in Houston not only voice coverage with the crew of Apollo 16, but will also provide telemetry data.
265:07:09 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Houston. If you'll give us Accept, we'll send up that Z PIPA bias.
265:07:14 Young: You have it.
265:07:20 Hartsfield: It appears that that PIPA's responding to temperature changes, is what the problem is, John.
265:07:28:Young: Okay.
265:08:37 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, the computer's yours.
265:08:42 Young: Okay, going to Block.

265:16:59 Duke (onboard): 1071.
265:17:00 Young (onboard): Okay, 1051. We'll take it.
265:17:02 Mattingly (onboard): It's close.
265:17:03 Young (onboard): 36272.
265:17:04 Mattingly (onboard): Twenty-one minutes to .05g; 23 [garble] 24 - Yep, that all looks pretty - pretty reasonable. Shall we?
265:17:24 Young (onboard): Yeah [garble] to separate.
265:17:28:Mattingly (onboard): Okay, that's where we stand by.
265:17:30 Duke (onboard): Okay, at 17 minutes, that's 290:06:31 [265:20:29] - three minutes from now.
265:17:35 Young (onboard): Okay, but you probably ought to yaw about 45 degrees now anyway.
265:17:37 Duke (onboard): Yeah.
265:17:38 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah. Are you ready to do that now?
265:17:39 Duke (onboard): Okay, manual attitude ...
265:17:38 Hartsfield: You're looking good coming up on sep.
265:17:42 Duke (onboard): Manual Attitude, three, Rate Command.
265:17:45 Mattingly (onboard): I have three in Rate Command.
265:17:47 Duke (onboard): Att Dead Band, Min.
265:17:49 Mattingly (onboard): Dead Band's Min.
265:17:51 Duke (onboard): Rate, High.
265:17:52 Mattingly (onboard): Rate's High.
265:17:53 Duke (onboard): Spacecraft Control to SCS.
265:17:57 Mattingly (onboard): SCS.
265:17:58 Duke (onboard): Yaw 45 out.
265:17:59 Mattingly (onboard): Left?
265:18:00 Duke (onboard): Left.
265:18:02 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, my BMAGs are uncaged.
265:18:04 Duke (onboard): BMAGs, Att 1/Rate 2.
265:18:06 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah; not until I get out there.
265:18:08 Duke (onboard): Okay; yeah.
265:18:28:Mattingly (onboard): Verify to Standby.
265:18:47 Duke (onboard): We should have a horizon check at 17 minutes also.
265:18:50 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. That really, I guess, should have been done before I yawed.
265:18:56 Duke (onboard): This is the same time as the yaw.
265:18:58 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah.
265:18:59 Duke (onboard): Same time as separation, exactly.
265:19:01 Young (onboard): You can't see the horizon start.
265:19:24 Young (onboard): Okay, yaw at 45 degrees out of plane.
265:19:28:Duke (onboard): BMAGs, Att 1/Rate 2?
265:19:31 Mattingly (onboard): Att 1/Rate 2.
265:19:32 Duke (onboard): I verify the Main Bus Ties are On.
265:19:35 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. Verify that the Glycol was pulled?
265:19:38 Duke (onboard): Okay, verify Glycol, Bypass?
265:19:41 Mattingly (onboard): That affirm.
265:19:42 Duke (onboard): EMS Mode to Standby, verify.
265:19:44 Mattingly (onboard): That's verified.
265:19:46 Duke (onboard): Okay, the CM RCS Logic, on, up.
265:19:49 Mattingly (onboard): CM RCS Logic is on.
265:19:52 Duke (onboard): Okay, we ...
265:19:53 Young (onboard): Turn up the lights.
265:19:54 Mattingly (onboard): Yes, sir. John ...
265:19:57 Young (onboard): The reason is because you can't see out once we ...
265:19:58 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah.
265:19:59 Young (onboard): ... [garble] in here.
265:20:00 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah. That's - that's a good plan.
265:20:02 Young (onboard): Okay.
265:20:03 Duke (onboard): Now we've got 17 minutes. We're coming up - or on 17. We separate at 15, at 290:08:31. We'll hold off on the Logic until 17. Okay?
265:20:17 Mattingly (onboard): The Logic?
265:20:18 Duke (onboard): SECS Logic, two, on, up, verify.
265:20:20 Mattingly (onboard): That's verified.
265:20:21 Young (onboard): Verified.
265:20:22 Duke (onboard): Okay. SECS Pyro ARM, two, to arm at 17. Okay?
265:20:24 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. And that's coming up in 10 seconds?
265:20:27 Duke (onboard): Ten seconds.
265:20:29 Mattingly (onboard): Okay.
265:20:33 Duke (onboard): Okay, SECS Pyro ARM, two, arm.
265:20:36 Mattingly (onboard): Two armed.
265:20:37 Duke (onboard): Okay, at 15, which is 290:08:31 [265:22:29], we separate. CM/SM Sep, two, on.
265:20:49 Mattingly (onboard): This time, John, you can hit any switch up there.
265:20:57 Young (onboard): [Garble] (laughter).
265:21:00 Mattingly (onboard): Just that row.
265:21:01 Young (onboard): Okay. Tell me when, Charlie, [Garble].
265:21:05 Duke (onboard): I will. We got a minute and a half.
265:21:08 Young: Okay; we're a minute and a half to CM/SM Sep.
265:21:12 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, you got your hand controller locked, but it's armed.
265:21:14 Hartsfield: Roger; copy.
265:21:14 Young (onboard): It's locked.
265:21:15 Mattingly (onboard): Okay.
265:21:31 Duke (onboard): We got all the scissors down and everything, didn't we?
265:21:34 Mattingly (onboard): I sure hope so, Charlie (laughter).
265:21:36 Duke (onboard): Okay, nothing up in here that I see. No screwdrivers or anything - tools. Okay. Within a minute.
265:22:02 Young (onboard): Should be a loud bang.
265:22:05 Mattingly (onboard): Man, will it ever.
265:22:17 Duke (onboard): Fifteen seconds, John.
265:22:21 Young (onboard): Say when.
265:22:22 Duke (onboard): Okay.
265:22:31 Duke (onboard): 3, 2, 1 -
265:22:32 Duke (onboard): Separate. There we go.
265:22:34 Mattingly (onboard): What's the Master [garble] for?
265:22:35 Duke (onboard): That's just - got to go to Caution and Warning.
265:22:41 Mattingly (onboard): Putting them in [garble]...
265:22:42 Duke: Separation, Houston.
265:22:44 Hartsfield: Roger.
That was the Lunar Module Pilot, Charlie Duke, reporting separation.
265:22:46 Duke (onboard): Man, it really went, didn't it? Manual Attitude, three, Min Impulse.
265:22:49 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah.
265:22:50 Duke (onboard): BMAGs, Rate 2.
265:22:51 Mattingly (onboard): Rate 2.
265:22:52 Duke (onboard): C&W mode, Command Module; RCS Transfer, Command Module...
265:22:54 Hartsfield: Everything looks good from down here, 16.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, the Service Module has separated on time. Casper now travels on entry systems only. Maneuvering now to a proper entry attitude.
265:22:52 Mattingly (onboard): Go.
265:22:56 Duke (onboard): ... CM RCS Logic, Off. Check ...
265:22:59 Mattingly (onboard): CM RCS Logic is Off.
265:23:00 Duke (onboard): ... pressures. They're good.
265:23:01 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. Oh. How's the cabin pressure?
265:23:05 Duke (onboard): Great.
265:23:06 Mattingly (onboard): Okay.
265:23:07 Duke (onboard): Hanging in there. Batteries are looking good; they picked up all the load. Battery compartment's looking good.
265:23:15 Mattingly (onboard): I was sure proud to hear that big bang.
265:23:17 Young (onboard): Me, too.
265:23:19 Duke (onboard): Okay, EMS - Yaw back to zero.
265:23:22 Mattingly (onboard): Going back.
265:23:24 Duke (onboard): Okay, the bu - bus voltages is hanging super - 28.
265:23:27 Mattingly (onboard): Boy, there's a lot of stuff out there.
265:23:29 Duke (onboard): Yaw back to ze - Okay?
265:23:30 Mattingly (onboard): I'm going back to zero, Charlie.
265:23:31 Duke (onboard): Pitch to entry attitude.
265:23:37 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, was I supposed to put EMS ...
265:23:38 Duke (onboard): 153.
265:23:39 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, was I supposed to put the EMS to - Normal yet? I mean ...
265:23:43 Duke (onboard): Yeah. EMS data, verify?
265:23:45 Mattingly (onboard): It's 1051 and 36276.
265:23:50 Duke (onboard): EMS Function, Entry.
265:23:53 Mattingly (onboard): It's Entry.
265:23:54 Duke (onboard): EMS Mode -
265:23:55 LMP/Young (onboard): Normal.
265:23:56 Mattingly (onboard): Normal.
265:23:57 Duke (onboard): Verify the filter down on .05g.
265:23:59 Mattingly (onboard): That's verified.
265:24:00 Duke (onboard): Okay, when you get to attitude, you can Pro to activate the entry ja - DAP.
265:24:05 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. No; wait a minute. We're not in attitude.
265:24:08 Young (onboard): [garble]
265:24:09 Duke (onboard): We got to pitch to 152.
265:24:11 Mattingly (onboard): Well, you can Pro on that anyhow. Where - where do we do our thing here?
265:24:14 Young (onboard): Right here.
265:24:15 Mattingly (onboard): Between - between these two steps, right?
265:24:16 Young (onboard): Yeah.
265:24:17 Mattingly (onboard): Okay.
265:24:18 Young (onboard): Pro.
265:24:20 Mattingly (onboard): It's all right. I'm in SCS, so it's okay.
265:24:21 Young (onboard): Okay, Verb 21.
265:24:25 Duke (onboard): Noun 46.
265:24:26 Young (onboard): 21, Noun 46.
265:24:29 CMP/Young (onboard): Enter.
265:24:30 Duke (onboard): 3000 Enter.
265:24:31 Mattingly (onboard): 30,000.
265:24:32 Duke (onboard): 30,000.
265:24:33 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. There you go. Enter.
265:24:38 Duke (onboard): Done.
265:24:39 Young: Okay, Houston, we have the - we have the bit 3 set in the 21 46.
265:24:44 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble]. We're venting something.
265:24:49 Hartsfield: Roger; and you're looking good.
This is Apollo Control, Houston the crew of Apollo 16 just loading the target latitude longitude board there onboard computer.
Guidance and Control reports the maneuver back to proper attitude for entry and progressing as programed.
265:24:52 Mattingly (onboard): We're venting something. Maybe it's the steam duct.
265:24:55 Young (onboard): Yeah, the water - water boils ...
265:24:56 Mattingly (onboard): I want to - going to the right and that thing - I looked up again and it turned around and went back to the left.
265:24:59 Young (onboard): Okay, the water boiling [garble] it right back. Yeah. Very definitely.
265:25:02 Duke (onboard): Yeah, we're boiling.
265:25:04 Mattingly (onboard): I didn't remember anyone ever mentioning that. That isn't in the simulator.
Michael Collins did mention it during the Apollo 11 debrief. As the evaporator is the spacecraft's only means of cooling the electronics, it is operating at quite a high level. As a result, it produces enough thrust from the steam duct to affect the attitude and Ken can feel this as he returns to the entry attitude.
265:25:07 Young (onboard): That doesn't do it very much. Got to be very sensitive.
265:25:09 Duke (onboard): Okay, 153 on the attitude.
265:25:11 Mattingly (onboard): Yes, sir.
265:25:12 Duke (onboard): You there?
265:25:13 Mattingly (onboard): No, no. Keep going (laughter).
265:25:15 Duke (onboard): Okay. Checking them off.
265:25:17 Mattingly (onboard): Okay.
265:25:18 Duke (onboard): Keeping you honest.
265:25:19 Mattingly (onboard): That's fair.
265:25:24 Duke (onboard): I nev - I thought I'd see the Service Module out the side, but it's - never did see it.
265:25:29 Young (onboard): You want a 06 22?
265:25:32 Mattingly (onboard): Say again?
265:25:33 Young (onboard): You want the 06 22?
265:25:34 Mattingly (onboard): 06 22.
265:25:35 Duke (onboard): When you do that, you get the CMC guidance.
265:25:36 Mattingly (onboard): Oh, oh.
265:25:37 Young (onboard): The X-axis is beyond 45 degrees out of velocity vector.
265:25:41 Mattingly (onboard): I'll probably get that. Go ahead.
Young, Duke, Mattingly now have their computer into the program that provides the prescribed entry into the Earth's atmosphere. The entry equations are in and there will hold...
265:25:54 Duke (onboard): Didn't get it; P63.
265:25:58 Young: Okay, we got P64 up and she's looking good...
265:26:02 Mattingly (onboard): 63.
265:26:03 Duke (onboard): 63.
265:26:04 Young: 63, I mean.
265:26:05 Hartsfield: Roger. P63.
With this program displayed, we now show the spacecraft at a - travelling at a velocity of 30,912 feet per second and range to go to target, 4,265 nautical miles.
Ten minutes and 30 seconds until time of entry into the Earth's atmosphere, Apollo 16 now travelling at a velocity of 31,405 feet per second, range to go to target 4,085 nautical miles. Mark minus 10 minutes until time that Casper encounters the Earth's atmosphere for the first time in eleven days. We show velocity now reading 31,690 feet per second, range to go to the splash point 3,976 nautical miles.
265:26:07 Young (onboard): Scared.
265:26:09 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, how far are we from EI?
265:26:11 Duke (onboard): Okay, we're at ...
265:26:12 Mattingly (onboard): Eight minutes?
265:26:13 Duke (onboard): No, we're at 11 minutes.
265:26:15 Mattingly (onboard): Eleven minutes.
265:26:16 Duke (onboard): And - about 11 minutes and 15 seconds.
265:26:18 Mattingly (onboard): The horizon will be about - Well, I've already missed the horizon. Okay.
265:26:22 Duke (onboard): Yeah. You can't tell with all those particles out there.
265:26:27 Mattingly (onboard): What? The horizon's out there?
265:26:28:Duke (onboard): Yeah. I mean what's stars and what's ...
265:26:31 Young (onboard): It ain't lit.
265:26:32 Mattingly (onboard): No, the horizon's gonna be [garble].
265:26:33 Duke (onboard): It ain't lit.
265:26:34 Mattingly (onboard): Well, when I find the Moon, I'm going to know where the horizon is. It'll be just below it.
265:26:40 Duke (onboard): What's pitch attitude, Ken?
265:26:42 Mattingly (onboard): We're about 210.
265:26:44 Duke (onboard): Okay.
265:26:46 Mattingly (onboard): Look - look at that, John. Look how fast that comes down.
265:26:51 Young (onboard): Yeah, it - it [garble].
265:26:53 Mattingly (onboard): You don't have to be too terribly sensitive to see that. That's the first place where the simulator hasn't been just like this thing.
265:27:03 Young (onboard): Well, sometimes it - water boils and sometimes it don't.
265:27:07 Mattingly (onboard): (Laughter) Okay.
265:27:14 Duke (onboard): Okay, at - when we get to 06 64, FDAI Scale, 5/5.
265:27:19 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, I ...
265:27:20 Duke (onboard): Okay.
265:27:21 Mattingly (onboard): I won't be there for a minute. I'll tell you when I get there.
265:27:22 Duke (onboard): Okay, fine.
265:27:23 Mattingly (onboard): You know, this is the first time we've had particles around us that color. Now I got some red ones and some yellow ones.
265:27:32 Young (onboard): That's nice.
265:27:34 Mattingly (onboard): I knew you'd like that.
265:27:35 Young (onboard): Yeah, I like that, baby.
265:27:42 Mattingly (onboard): It also takes the pitch out, but it's not as effective as the - the yaw.
Apollo Control Houston, Flight Director Phil Shaffer checks again with his team here at Mission Control as to our status; all systems are looking very good at this time. We're nine minutes away now from time of entry to the Earth's atmosphere. Velocity for Apollo 16; 32,195 feet per second. Range to go to target; 3,784 nautical miles.
265:27:53 Young (onboard): Come on, baby, hang in there.
265:27:54 Duke (onboard): We've got a zillion particles.
265:27:58 Mattingly (onboard): Everything looking good so far.
265:28:01 Duke (onboard): Yeah.
265:28:10 Mattingly (onboard): I do like to hear those things go. Very nice feeling.
265:28:16 Young (onboard): Six minutes away.
265:28:17 Mattingly (onboard): Six minutes?
265:28:19 Young (onboard): About, yeah.
265:28:20 Duke (onboard): No.
265:28:21 Young (onboard): Ten [garble] ...
265:28:22 Mattingly (onboard): [garble] ...
265:28:23 Young (onboard): Ten, yeah.
265:28:24 Duke (onboard): Be nine minutes.
265:28:28:Mattingly (onboard): What you got that camera set on, Charlie?
265:28:30 Duke (onboard): I've got it on f/11, Just what the checklist says.
265:28:32 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah.
265:28:33 Duke (onboard): Wh ...
265:28:34 Mattingly (onboard): I was just thinking - I don't know why I didn't think of this before, but I bet you could get moonset on that thing. Give a little burst as the Moon goes down.
265:28:43 Duke (onboard): Okay. Okay, I'll set it to about 6 frames a second.
265:28:51 Mattingly (onboard): What - what's it normally on?
265:28:52 Duke (onboard): Twelve.
265:28:53 Mattingly (onboard): Twelve.
265:28:55 Duke (onboard): Hey, that's a nice red particle out there.
265:28:57 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah, there's a lot of color.
Apollo Control Houston, the recovery support room here in Mission Control reports all recovery aircraft are on stand...
265:29:05 Mattingly (onboard): Want another antenna?
265:29:07 Duke (onboard): Houston, 16; our signal strength's down.
265:29:08 Duke: Houston, 16 - on another antenna.
265:29:XX Duke (onboard): Should be a good one. I think they've got groun - ground problems.
265:29:22 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Houston. We're reading you.
265:29:27 Duke: Looks like your up-link's a little weak, Hank; we're down - we're getting a lot of scratchiness.
265:29:32 Hartsfield: Roger; we're hearing the same thing.
265:29:37 Young (onboard): It's ARIA is what it is.
265:29:38 Mattingly (onboard): It's - yeah - how about that? They work.
265:29:43 Duke (onboard): What works?
265:29:44 Mattingly (onboard): ARIA. That wasn't Hank.
265:29:46 Duke (onboard): Yeah, it was.
265:29:46 Hartsfield: Roger, 16. We're coming through ARIA now.
265:29:49 Duke (onboard): Yeah, it was. That's Hank.
265:29:50 Mattingly (onboard): Really?
265:29:51 Duke (onboard): Yeah.
265:29:52 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble] y'all have heard [garble] on ARIA.
265:29:52 Duke: Okay; you sounded pretty good then.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, 7 minutes, 30 seconds now to the time of Entry. Flight Director Phil Shaffer again checking with his control team as to status. His console coming up all greens; we've had a loss of signal, as far as telemetry data is concerned following this pass over to the Apollo Ranging and Instrumentation Aircraft.
265:30:04 Duke (onboard): Seven g's.
265:30:07 Mattingly (onboard): (Laughter) It's going to feel it.
265:30:08 Young (onboard): It's gonna hurt. It really is, I bet you.
265:30:14 Mattingly (onboard): Yep.
265:30:27 Mattingly (onboard): Try not to get any surprises. I guess - no one's ever talked about them coming down.
265:30:33 Young (onboard): No.
265:30:34 Duke (onboard): Don't let any dust get in your eyes; there's a lot floating around here.
265:30:35 Hartsfield: And, Apollo 16, Houston. We do not have telemetry.
265:30:41 Duke: Okay; we're looking good, Hank.
265:30:45 Hartsfield: Roger.
Apollo Control, Houston. Six minutes now until time of entry into the Earth's atmosphere.
265:30:44 Mattingly (onboard): (Laughter) We'll give you our status. I guess they can't get anything through ARIA.
265:31:08 Duke (onboard): Still don't see the Moon.
265:31:10 Mattingly (onboard): It won't show up until it - it's moving. It isn't, but we are - moving very rapidly in central angle now.
265:31:16 Duke (onboard): Yeah.
265:31:17 Mattingly (onboard): And when it comes, it's going to go down - it only takes like a second or two to set.
265:31:21 Young (onboard): Don't know what ...
265:31:24 Duke (onboard): Okay, we got the attitude yet?
265:31:25 Mattingly (onboard): Not quite,
265:31:26 Young (onboard): ... [garble] what good that does you.
265:31:28:Mattingly (onboard): What that does for you? If you lose your attitude reference, you can go find the Moon and that just gives you an idea what time that thing ought to set. And then you know where the horizon is. And you can uncage a BMAG there and then pitch 30 degrees and you're - you're near it.
265:31:42 Young (onboard): Oh, okay. That simple, I'd buy it.
265:31:55 Young (onboard): 3000 miles to go, gang; 33,971 feet a second, Charlie.
265:32:02 Duke (onboard): 3000 miles to go?
265:32:03 Young (onboard): Yep.
265:32:04 Duke (onboard): Gyah! We're hauling it. I'll tell you, babe, we're hauling it.
265:32:10 Mattingly (onboard): We're still accelerating.
265:32:13 Young (onboard): Yeah, we're starting to pick up speed now.
265:32:15 Mattingly (onboard): You can feel it go faster.
265:32:16 Duke (onboard): Is that to touchdown ...
265:32:17 Mattingly (onboard): I feel it ...
265:32:18 Duke (onboard): ... or is that to EI?
265:32:19 Mattingly (onboard): ... [garble] I'm heavy.
265:32:20 Young (onboard): Huh?
265:32:21 Duke (onboard): Is that 3000 miles to EI?
265:32:22 Mattingly (onboard): Touchdown ...
265:32:23 Young (onboard): That's 3000 miles to touchdown.
265:32:25 Duke (onboard): Oh.
265:32:28:Young (onboard): They always say the ...
265:32:29 Duke (onboard): [garble] SET is 290 ...
265:32:30 Young (onboard): ... the last 3000 is the hardest. They don't say it. I just made it up.
265:32:37 Mattingly (onboard): I see. That's very good.
265:32:39 Young (onboard): We don't want to come up with any more of those little things.
265:32:42 Mattingly (onboard): (Laughter) Yeah. I get the last 10,000 feet.
Mark. Five minutes now until time of entry interface.
265:32:48 Duke (onboard): We there yet, Ken?
265:32:49 Mattingly (onboard): (Laughter) No.
265:32:51 Young (onboard): Well, hurry up.
265:32:52 Mattingly (onboard): (Laughter) What have we got to do?
265:32:57 Duke (onboard): Well, you got five minutes.
265:32:59 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. I got 10 degrees.
265:33:01 Duke (onboard): Okay, good.
265:33:02 Mattingly (onboard): What are we going to do when we get here?
265:33:03 Duke (onboard): Just make me comfortable.
265:33:04 Crew (onboard): (Laughter)
265:33:05 Young (onboard): (Laughter) Hang in there. 153 is the attitude.
265:33:12 Mattingly (onboard): Yes, sir.
265:33:14 Young (onboard): That's the only thing I know this morning.
265:33:17 Mattingly (onboard): That's really all you've got to know.
265:33:18 Duke (onboard): We've got a couple of things to do, really; FDAI Scale and Rot Control Power.
265:33:23 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, Rot Control Power - what are you going to do with that? I got [garble] ...
265:33:25 Duke (onboard): Direct, two, Main A/Main B.
265:33:26 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah, I did that before Sep.
Apollo Control, Houston, minus 4 minutes, 23 seconds, we're now receiving ARIA telemetry data through Hawaii. We show Apollo 16 now travelling at a velocity of 34,672 feet per second and range to go to splash...
265:33:27 Hartsfield: Got data back and you're looking good.
265:33:31 Young: Roger.
265:33:43 Crew (onboard): (Singing) Da-da-da-da.
265:33:46 Duke (onboard): Okay, wind my watch.
265:33:49 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah, I had to put that on my post sleep checklist because I never remember to wind it. I can't believe - program like this and you got to have a self - can't have a self-winding watch.
265:34:02 Young (onboard): Digital manpower at work.
265:34:06 Mattingly (onboard): There's something basic about telling time that - seems to be very difficult. Okay, I'm at attitude, Charlie.
265:34:13 Duke (onboard): Okay. FDAI Scale, 5/5.
265:34:16 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, going to 5/5.
265:34:17 Duke (onboard): Okay. Now we just stay hanging in here - until .05g.
265:34:30 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, and I want to start my wristwatch at .05. I don't know what good that'll do me. I mean at RRT. I'll - I'll set this thing; it just might work. Maybe it'll be sympathetic. It did it on TEI, much to my amazement.
265:34:45 Young (onboard): Okay, we got 3 minutes to RRT.
265:34:53 Mattingly (onboard): Now, the Moon's already set according to this.
265:34:56 Duke (onboard): No, 292 - Yeah, it is - too - I never saw it.
265:35:01 Mattingly (onboard): No, we weren't in attitude.
265:35:02 Duke (onboard): Okay.
265:35:03 Mattingly (onboard): We were in attitude for Entry, not for watching moonset.
265:35:08 Duke (onboard): Okay, I'm back to 12 frames a second, then.
265:35:24 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. Okay, all I've got to do is get these guys back to Rate Command and go to CMC, and I'll do that soon as we start to pick up a little aerodynamics.
265:35:51 Young (onboard): Okay, we're about a minute out.
One minute, 30 seconds. Apollo now travelling at a velocity of 35,823 feet per second. Range to go to splash 1,678 nautical miles.
265:35:52 Duke (onboard): A minute -
265:35:53 Mattingly (onboard): A minute -
265:35:54 Duke/Mattingly (onboard): And a half.
265:35:57 Young (onboard): And Entry in Normal?
265:35:59 Mattingly (onboard): Yes, sir.
265:36:01 Young (onboard): Got both regs on the line?
265:36:03 Mattingly (onboard): Roger.
265:36:04 Young (onboard): Pyros are armed.
265:36:05 Mattingly (onboard): Yep.
265:36:06 Young (onboard): CM/SM Sep switch - circuit breakers are in.
265:36:08 Mattingly (onboard): Yep.
265:36:10 Young (onboard): Think of anything else.
265:36:13 Mattingly (onboard): I got to get these.
265:36:15 Duke (onboard): Yeah. Yeah, okay; that's at .05g. You - you also .05g switch and EMS ROLL switch.
265:36:22 Mattingly (onboard): Okay.
265:36:23 Duke (onboard): Okay, and Spacecraft Control - SC MCC [sic]. You got four to get ...
265:36:24 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Houston. You're still looking good.
265:36:26 Young: Roger.
Mark. Minus one minute. Velocity now 35,967 feet per second. Range to go 1,518 nautical miles.
265:36:33 Duke (onboard): You're one minute out.
265:36:41 Young (onboard): You might get a little this early because -
265:36:45 Duke (onboard): I think I'm starting to pick up some aero.
265:36:47 Young (onboard): Yeah, they -
265:36:49 Duke (onboard): That's the horizon. Look at that.
265:36:51 Young (onboard): Get back in the cockpit, Charlie.
265:36:52 Duke (onboard): Okay.
265:36:56 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, the needle's coming off the peg. That's doing good work.
265:36:58 Young (onboard): Yeah, it's right on.
265:37:01 Mattingly (onboard): Okay.
30 seconds now. Velocity 36,094 feet per second. Range to go 1,357 nautical miles.
265:37:03 Duke (onboard): Thirty seconds to RRT.
265:37:14 Mattingly (onboard): And call at RRT.
265:37:17 Duke (onboard): Okay; 15 seconds.
Minus 10 seconds. Velocity 36,173 feet per second. Range to go 1,170 nautical miles.
265:37:27 Young (onboard): Watch it diverge there.
265:37:28:Duke (onboard): Six seconds, 5 seconds - 2, 1 -
265:37:33 Duke (onboard): Mark; RRT. Watch is started.
265:37:35 Mattingly (onboard): Clock's running. Okay, I'm going to Rate Command.
We've seen a dropout in our telemetry data indicating Apollo 16 now passing through the Earth's atmosphere.
265:37:39 Duke (onboard): And Spacecraft Control to CMC.
265:37:43 Young (onboard): Better get it back; get that needle back.
265:37:44 Duke (onboard): Okay, we got some - glow ...
265:37:46 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, get your [garble]. Look at the glow.
265:37:48 Young (onboard): Give it [garble].
265:37:49 Mattingly (onboard): It's got it. CMC has control.
265:37:50 Duke (onboard): Okay.
265:37:51 Young (onboard): Okay. Hundredth of a g ...
265:37:53 Duke (onboard): Camera's started.
265:37:55 Mattingly (onboard): One ...
265:37:56 Young (onboard): 200.
265:37:57 Mattingly (onboard): Twenty-three.

265:38:19 Mattingly (onboard): Coming up on 1 ...
Apollo Control Houston. We are at one minute, 5 seconds now since time of entry into the Earth's atmosphere.
265:38:20 Young (onboard): 1.0, 1.3, 2, 2.8 ...
One minutes 10 seconds now. Apollo 16 going through its maximum heat load. This should be 4000 to 4500 degrees Fahrenheit, the maximum temperature on the surface of the heat shield.
265:38:32 Duke (onboard): That's just 2?
265:38:33 Mattingly (onboard): No, that's 4.
265:38:34 Young (onboard): 4.
265:38:38 Mattingly/Young (onboard): 5.
265:38:40 Mattingly (onboard): Right on. There's 6.
265:38:42 Duke (onboard): 6.
Mark. One minute, 25 seconds. Apollo 16 now encountering max G, which should be approximately 7 Gs.
265:38:48 Young (onboard): 6.9; 7.
265:38:54 Mattingly (onboard): It's easing off.
265:38:57 Young (onboard): 7. Comp for roll.
265:38:59 Mattingly (onboard): Good.
We're at one minute, 40 seconds since entry. We show the period of ending blackout a little less than two minutes away now.
265:39:00 Young (onboard): Plus 53.
265:39:01 Mattingly (onboard): Circle it.
265:39:02 Young (onboard): Plus 90.

265:39:11 Young (onboard): 5g's; 4.9.
265:39:14 Mattingly (onboard): Outstanding machine! Something's on my window.
265:39:20 Young (onboard): Guess that's Mylar over there.
265:39:21 Duke (onboard): Mylar.
265:39:23 Mattingly (onboard): 4g's; DO.
265:39:24 Young (onboard): Plus 190, plus 87...
265:39:27 Mattingly (onboard): Good work.
265:39:28:Young (onboard): Plus 53.
265:39:29 Mattingly (onboard): Fly, you booger.
265:39:34 Young (onboard): Okay, we're subcirc.
265:39:36 Mattingly (onboard): Oh, yeah; are we?
265:39:37 Duke (onboard): Yeah; subcirc.
265:39:38 Mattingly (onboard): My watch is - my ...
265:39:39 Young (onboard): Comp for plus one.
265:39:41 Mattingly (onboard): Okay.
265:39:42 Duke (onboard): And roll.
265:39:44 Mattingly (onboard): Doing good work, machine. How's the ...
265:39:51 Young (onboard): [Garble] .. north ...
265:39:52 Mattingly (onboard): How's the pressures?
265:39:53 Young (onboard): ... and 11.7 -

265:40:03 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, I'll just copy it, John. No sweat; we are sitting right in here. Beautiful machine. EMS and G&N are converging. We're down to 2½g's.
265:40:18 Crew (onboard): (Coughing)
265:40:20 Young (onboard): Plus 68; plus 69. Reversing roll.
265:40:24 Mattingly (onboard): Outstanding.
265:40:25 Young (onboard): It went ...
265:40:26 Mattingly (onboard): Good decision.
265:40:27 Young (onboard): ... 23 north; now it's going back south.
265:40:28:Mattingly (onboard): Good decision. 82; good show.
265:40:32 Young (onboard): Okay, what time you got, Charlie?
265:40:35 Duke (onboard): I got three minutes -
265:40:36 Duke (onboard): Mark.
265:40:37 Young (onboard): Okay.
265:40:38 Duke (onboard): We haven't entered blackout yet.
265:40:39 Young (onboard): Yeah. Ahh.
265:40:41 Duke (onboard): 03:31.
265:40:42 Mattingly (onboard): Outstanding!
Ken Mattingly, from JSC Oral History Project: "Then after floating around and you realize that you've gotten so used to things, just set them out there. They'll be there. You don't need anything. All of a sudden there was a preference that 6 things kind of disappeared that way. Then the spacecraft would just kind of rock a little bit. You're not feeling any Gs, but the spacecraft would rock, and you'd hear the jets try to fight it. So then they would come back in further, and then you started finding that, yes, indeed, you were laying against the couch now. As the g forces built up, you're looking aft from the direction you're going. Looking out the window, you started to see little color, light blue wisp, like a gas stove. It's coming from around the side, and you see it as it goes off, because the gas is being ionized on a heat shield back here, and it's flowing around. As the gs build up, this little wisp becomes a light until it gets so bright that I was tempted to put my hand up over the window so I could read the instruments. The instruments aren't really well lit, but I was really putting my hand up here over the window so that I could see. It was this bright white light, and as the g forces eased off as you penetrate the atmosphere, the light went to dim until it kind of all went away."
265:40:43 Young (onboard): Okay, the RCS pressures are looking good. They're at 3000...
265:40:45 Duke (onboard): 27:02; we in blackout?
265:40:49 Young (onboard): Minus 86 ...
265:40:50 Mattingly (onboard): It's gonna start pulling that range off.
265:40:51 Young (onboard): Minus 84.
265:40:53 Mattingly (onboard): It's gonna pull another 4g's here pretty soon.
265:40:54 Young (onboard): Gonna get another big g here, huh?
265:40:56 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah.
265:40:58 Young (onboard): Minus 80.
265:41:00 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, we -
265:41:02 Young (onboard): Minus 77; minus 76 -
265:41:06 Duke (onboard): Okay, we [garble] blackout right on time.
265:41:08 Young (onboard): Okay.
265:41:09 Duke (onboard): Got signal strength.
265:41:10 Young (onboard): Houston, we're out of the first blackout there.
265:41:15 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, the gs are going to be building up again.
265:41:17 Duke (onboard): Okay.
265:41:22 Young (onboard): Minus 50 ...
265:41:23 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble] up.
265:41:24 Young (onboard): Minus 50.
265:41:25 Mattingly (onboard): Fine.
265:41:26 Young (onboard): Minus 50; minus 48; minus 48.
265:41:29 Mattingly (onboard): Fine.
265:41:30 Young (onboard): Minus 48.
265:41:31 Mattingly (onboard): Good, good.
265:41:32 Young (onboard): Zero down range.
265:41:33 Duke (onboard): Coming up on - 4 minutes.
265:41:34 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Houston.
265:41:35 Young: Roger. Loud and clear.
265:41:37 Mattingly (onboard): Okay ...
265:41:38 Hartsfield: Roger. How's it going?
265:41:38 Young (onboard): Minus 49.
265:41:39 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, don't bother to read the angles.
265:41:41 Young (onboard): Okay.
265:41:43 Duke (onboard): Okay, passed - we passed four minutes.
265:41:45 Mattingly (onboard): All right. This thing is almost as smooth as I'd fly it.
265:41:52 Young (onboard): (Chuckle) Beautiful.
265:41:53 Mattingly (onboard): I'm glad, mmm. But I'm willing to concede.
265:41:58 Young (onboard): What's the g's now?
265:41:59 Mattingly (onboard): Coming up on 3.
265:42:00 Young (onboard): Okay.
265:42:01 Mattingly (onboard): You're going to get maybe another half ...
265:42:01 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Houston. We're getting a little data now and everything looks good.
265:42:02 Duke (onboard): 04:30 ...
265:42:03 Mattingly (onboard): ... and that's about it.
265:42:04 Duke (onboard): Mark.
265:42:05 Mattingly (onboard): It's doing all the right things. It's gonna have to give you another half a g.
265:42:19 Mattingly (onboard): Man, that EMS would have gotten home.
265:42:22 Young (onboard): Isn't that something?
265:42:23 Duke (onboard): Coming up on 5.
265:42:26 Young (onboard): Reversing.
265:42:27 Mattingly (onboard): Good show.
265:42:28 Young (onboard): Supposed to. Man, it hoses it out, I'll tell you.
265:42:31 Mattingly (onboard): Oh.
265:42:32 Young (onboard): [garble] ...
265:42:33 Mattingly (onboard): You know, I didn't think we were having many g's ...
265:42:34 Duke (onboard): Five minutes.
265:42:35 Mattingly (onboard): ... until I tried to raise my head (chuckle).
265:42:36 Young (onboard): Yeah.
265:42:37 Duke (onboard): Man, 2g's felt like a ton.
265:42:39 Mattingly (onboard): You're sitting on 3.
265:42:40 Duke (onboard): Okay.
265:42:41 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble] steady as a rock.
265:42:42 Young (onboard): Plus 70.
265:42:43 Mattingly (onboard): Steering looks a champion.
265:42:44 Young (onboard): Yeah, it looks good.
265:42:46 Mattingly (onboard): It's gonna dig in a little more.
265:42:53 Young (onboard): Man, if this don't get you back to one g, nothing will.
265:42:55 Duke (onboard): I know it.
265:42:56 Mattingly (onboard): Oh, beautiful
265:42:58 Duke (onboard): Okay, m - on my mark, it'll be 05:30.
265:43:02 Duke (onboard): Mark; 05:30.
265:43:16 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. Looks to me like that little guy is just gonna do a super job.
265:43:21 Duke (onboard): [Garble].
265:43:22 Young (onboard): Land us right on the sh - the ship.
265:43:27 Duke (onboard): Okay, coming up on 6 minutes. We should be at 90K momentarily.
265:43:31 Mattingly (onboard): Okay.
265:43:33 Young (onboard): Look out, Ticonderoga, we're gonna hit you.
265:43:34 Duke (onboard): Okay, 6 minutes. Steam pressure's not pegging on time.
265:43:46 Mattingly (onboard): It's not?
265:43:47 Duke (onboard): No.
265:43:51 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, I think we're just about to the transonic region.
265:43:55 Duke (onboard): Okay. Okay, there comes the - there comes the steam pressure.
265:44:01 Mattingly (onboard): P67 ...
265:44:02 Duke (onboard): Gonna be late - late on the steam pressure.
265:44:03 Mattingly/Young (onboard): Okay.
265:44:04 Duke (onboard): P67; I'm stopping the DAC. Okay, changing to f/8. Okay, steam pressure's pegged.
265:44:14 Young (onboard): Okay, we're through 90K.
265:44:15 Duke (onboard): Okay, 90K.
265:44:16 Young (onboard): Through 90K, Houston.
265:44:19 Duke (onboard): Okay, stand by for 50K.
265:44:29 Mattingly (onboard): There's a little transonics.
265:44:31 Young/Duke (onboard): Yeah.
265:44:32 Mattingly (onboard): That was premature. Okay, I'm off the peg with the altimeter.
265:44:36 Duke (onboard): Okay.
265:44:37 Young (onboard): Altimeter's off the peg.
265:44:38 Duke (onboard): Give me a call at 50K.
265:44:39 Mattingly (onboard): Stand by.
265:44:40 Young (onboard): Go to - go to Boost/Entry ...
265:44:41 Duke (onboard): Boost/Entry.
265:44:42 Mattingly (onboard): Mark; 50K.
265:44:43 Duke (onboard): Boost/Entry.
265:44:44 Mattingly (onboard): Boost/Entry on two sides. Okay.
265:44:45 Duke (onboard): Okay. At 30K, we want ELS Logic and ELS, Auto.
265:44:49 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. Coming up on 40. That's the relief valves.
265:44:57 Mattingly (onboard): 40K.
265:44:58 Duke (onboard): Okay.
265:45:06 Duke (onboard): Give me a ...
265:45:07 Mattingly (onboard): At 35K,
265:45:08 Duke (onboard): Okay.
265:45:09 Mattingly (onboard): I'll start the camera.
265:45:10 Duke (onboard): I think that's too bright of a setting.
265:45:11 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah.
265:45:12 Young (onboard): Okay, get...

The Earth landing system helicopter reports that they were unable to recover the apex cover of (garble) drogue chutes. The three main chutes were recovered.
Recovery: Recovery standing by the hatch. And Casper the Command Module is being opened. (Garble) Command Module.
The life preservers have been passed inside to the crew of Apollo 16. The swimmer is Lt. Earl Koshida who was the first to jump from the primary recovery helicopter.
Crew: Recovery, Apollo 16 is going off comm.
Recovery: This is Recovery, roger.
Recovery: The hatch to the Command Module is being slowly opened by the crewmen.
Crew: Roger.
Ken Mattingly, from JSC Oral History Project: "Hit the water, rolled over. The procedure to get it right-side-up worked. One of my least favorite things was the emergency procedure for getting out upside-down. So, man, the swimmers were there, and they put the collar around the spacecraft. You're really feeling just a sensation of elation. The swimmer had a beard, standing on his little raft outside the hatch. We opened the hatch, and I had gotten us there because I was "Mr. Hatch." I opened this hatch, and I didn't know what he was going to say, but something, and the next thing I know, this thing goes "Wham!" and it's right back in my face. "Why did you do that?" I opened it again, and the guy said, "Sorry." Okay. So we got out, put us in the chopper. We got back. They brought the spacecraft aboard and set it on the flight deck, went in and got cleaned up. I thought, well, I'll go up on the flight deck and see what I had this thing that, by golly, I'm going to walk around as much as I can before anybody sits me down and says I can't. So I go up on the flight deck and see the swimmer team was up there. I recognized I said, "What happened out there with the hatch?" He says, "You don't know?" I said, "No. What's the matter?" He says, "Let me open the hatch." And the odor was unbelievable. Thank God our olfactory nerves disappear early in life. Living in a bathroom for ten days is not a desired position. Life magazine doesn't tell you about those things. Boy, was that terrible."
Recovery: (Garble) the hatch open, standing by to assist the astronaut in egressing the Module.
And this Apollo Recovery raft is especially contoured to fit along side of the floatation collar attached to the spacecraft.
USS Ticonderoga: (Garble) Ticonderoga (garble).

Touchdown.
John Young, Charles Duke, Ken Mattingly home from the Moon. Safely back aboard the USS Ticonderoga. Now the red carpets go out. The honor guard comes out. And you can see them now rolling that bright red carpet right up to the door of the helicopter. Now the steps being moved in. And there we are from the falls in our photo helicopter. That was Charles Hilly, The NASA Team Leader, who was first aboard to greet the Astronauts (music) also with military escorts. Salute, a wave. John Young, Charles Duke, Ken Mattingly, Apollo 16 crew. (music) Larry King, the NASA Public Information Officer, also with them at this point. Now they'll be greeted by Captain Edward Boyd, Rear Admiral Henry Morgan, (music) Captain Edward Boyd.
Boyd: It gives me a great deal of pleasure this morning on this special day, to welcome the crew of Apollo 16 to the deck of Ticonderoga. The officers and men of Ticonderoga, this historic ship, are very proud indeed to be a part of this historic mission. Commander Lex Davis, Ticonderoga's senior Chaplain will offer our prayer to almighty God.
Chaplain: Let us pray. Almighty God, who alone prescribes the order of the universe, we lift our thanks to the for the safe return of the astronauts Young, Duke, and Mattingly. As the Heavens once lead wise men to the cradle of Thy Son, so may the knowledge of Thy celestial creation guide us to greater understanding of Thy will for mankind. That Thy goodness may be magnified throughout the world to the honor of Thy holy name. Amen.
Boyd: Admiral Henry S. Morgan, commander of the Pacific Recovery Force, will introduce the crew of Apollo 16.
Morgan: This is a moment of pride and humble triumph for the crew of Apollo 16. Those of us of the Pacific Recovery Force, spread about this Ocean, are honored to be a small segment of the picture. I know the crew is glad to be back and we're all glad to see you back. Now Captain John Young, the commander of Apollo 16.
Young: It really is great to be back. I think I have to say thank you to four different groups of people today. I'm not going to make a long speech because that isn't my nature. But I've been working with a couple of guys for about two years, they've always demonstrated [that] they're clever, intelligent, resourceful and all the good words. But in the last 10 days on a mission where kind of critical things had to go just right where we had some rather difficult problems and rather minor problems, Ken and Charlie, performed an outstanding manner. Their professional cool courage and discipline in situations which required time critical button punching, stick throwing, switch pulling, was tremendous and they also exhibited a cool, professional courage in situations where they were involved in some personal risk, I feel. So to them I would like to say outstanding, for your performance. For the benefit of you Navy guys that's a hardy well done. The second group of people is the people at the Manned Spacecraft Center, in Houston, Texas and around the country, who did so much during our mission to make it go. We could tell by every message that came to us, that there had been a lot of people working all over the country to do their jobs. And by golly we appreciate it because we made that mission go, thanks to you. The third group of people, that nobody ever talked about much, is the American taxpayer, I think you taxpayers, we taxpayers, you got your money's worth on this one. You really did. You saw an example of go-oriented team work and action. The kind of thing that made this country great and the kind of thing that's going to keep it that way. You also saw and sitting right there in Casper right now a mission of discovery. There are secrets in that vehicle that nobody knows what is in there. There is some basic knowledge and understanding in that vehicle right now. We're going to find those things out and one of these days, it's going to benefit us all. I can guarantee you, I feel that if we hadn't done our mission we'd have been remiss in not uncovering this basic knowledge. And what I'm saying is that that basic knowledge is locked in those secrets. It's pushing back the last real frontier, the frontier of the unknown. And by golly that's essential to the survival of humanity on this planet. And the fourth group of people and maybe the people I feel more at home with than anybody is the good old US Navy, thanks for being here, cause I'll tell you right about now, Charlie, Ken, and myself aren't swimming too good.
Mattingly: Well I don't want to make any speech. I never thought a group of all males could look so good. But you sure do. We'll fix that in a short time too. But thank you very much for doing a very professional job and to all the people back in Houston, and the rest of the NASA team, I hope they get a chance to come back and personally say thank you to all of you folks. You really did a bang up job. Thank you.
Duke: It's pretty difficult for me to put my feelings into words right now. We've seen so much and done so much in the last 11 days, it's almost indescribable the beauties and the scenes you see. You don't think that, that one can be topped and then sure enough the next one tops it. Most clearest in my mind is the entry right now and that's hard to top. It's going to be a while to digest everything that has happened, but I along with John, would like to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to the four groups of people that he mentioned. Thank you again, everyone, it's good to be back and to be looking forward to seeing every one again. Thank you.
Unidentified: (music and clapping.)
Unidentified: Welcome back.
They'll go below for their first physical examinations, a rest period and indeed a shower. The Apollo 16 crew home safely, back aboard the prime recovery vessel the USS Ticonderoga, and there they go. So my thanks...
This is Apollo Control, Houston, and this concludes our coverage of Apollo 16.
