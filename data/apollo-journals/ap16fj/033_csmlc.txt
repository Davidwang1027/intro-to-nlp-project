Apollo 16 - Launch Checklist
The Launch Checklist provides the crew with a quick reference to the
actions needed during launch and Trans Lunar Insertion. It also
covers the crew actions required during mission aborts, including
failures of the Saturn V, and de-orbit re-entry after an alternative
Earth-orbital mission, if TLI is not possible. Like similar
checklists in aircraft, the Apollo Checklists are intended as memmory
joggers, and are normally used by one cremember reading out the action,
and the other crewmembers carrying out the requisite task.
The Checklists are derived from Volume 2 of the Apollo Operations
Handbook, which contains the detailed
operating procedures for the various systems in the spacecraft, under
both normal and emergency conditions. The Checklists are then
developed through simulation, and from experience in previous
missions. This section contains scans of the 220 pages of the
Launch Checklist .
The basic version of the document here is dated 13 December 1971, 3
months
before the intended flight date. It was then amended by Revision
A dated 7 March 1972 (printed amendment. Hand written amendments
followed; Change A on 29 March 1972 and Change B on 6 April 1972.
The Checklist will have
continued to be amended up until, and during, the
flight.
