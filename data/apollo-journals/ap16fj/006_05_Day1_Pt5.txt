This is Apollo Control at 7 hours, 3 minutes. The spacecraft will shortly be maneuvering to the proper attitude to take a series of ultraviolet photographs of Earth using the electric Hasselblad camera which is mounted in the right side window of the Command Module. We expect that as the spacecraft maneuvers, we'll lose lock with the High Gain Antenna and the communications will probably momentarily drop-out or become quite noisy until we reestablish [a] solid lock-on. The crew, by this time, should have completed their, what would amount to lunch. They're coming up now on the series of ultraviolet photographs of Earth and this is an experiment which gathers ultraviolet photos both of the Earth and later of the Moon for studies of planetary atmospheres. Also prior to what will amount to their evening meal or dinner, the crew will be doing a series of mid-course navigation sightings and also will be changing the lithium hydroxide canister and setting the spacecraft up in a Passive Thermal Control mode, a slow rotation of about three revolutions per hour to maintain the proper temperature equilibrium. At the present time we show Apollo 16 33,696 nautical miles [62,405 kilometres] from Earth, spacecraft velocity 10,358 feet [3,157 metres] per second.
007:04:13 Duke: Okay, Houston. You have Omni Delta.
007:04:16 Peterson: Roger. Copy Omni Delta.

007:16:29 Duke: Houston, 16. Over.
007:16:31 Peterson: Go ahead, 16.
007:16:34 Duke: Okay, Pete. I think we've figured out what all this white particles that's coming off the LM. On the - on the side that - of the LM that's between this omni antenna and the APS - the ascent propulsion propellant tank, there's a surface that was gray that - that is now - for some reason, the thing is all strip - striped looking. It's a surface that's really almost perpendicul - parallel to the plus-X [side] of the LM. And it - it's all tattered and torn and shredded - looks like shredded wheat, is what it reminds me of. Over.
On the LM, the positions are identified by reference to "stations", located on X, Y and Z axes. The X-axis is the vertical axis, with its positive direction is from the descent stage to the ascent stage, passing through the overhead hatch. The Y-axis is the lateral axis and its positive direction is from left to right across the astronauts shoulders when they are facing the windows in the LM cabin. The third axis is the Z-axis which is is perpendicular to the X and Y axes. This axis is referred to as the forward axis, because +Z-axis direction is through the forward hatch. The +Z-axis is also used as the zero reference line for all angular measurements.
Here, the crew are describing particles coming off a surface that is parallel to the plus-X (upper surface) of the LM Ascent Stage. The following excerpt from the Apollo 16 Mission Report covers the particles, which turn out to be flaking paint. In the excerpt, the Report refers to the minus-Y, (left side) of the Ascent Stage - both are actually describing the same panels.
From the Apollo 16 Mission Report: "Just prior to transposition and docking, particles were coming off the thermal shield panels on the minus Y side of the ascent stage... The paint flakes interferred with star sightings and were potential optical surface contaminants. Thermal tests conducted on specimens removed from a Lunar Module panel demonstrated that the paint on the panels starts to peel at approximately minus 120°F [49°C]. The predicted minimum temperature of the panels during the mission is minus 270°F [132°C]. Effective with the Apollo 15 spacecraft, changes were made to the vehicle to minimize the Reaction Control System propellant temperatures for the 72-hour lunar stay design case. One change was that 16 panels on the Ascent Stage were painted white. Subsequently, a more effective change was made by the addition of tank insulation. The effect of total loss of the paint on the panels results in a maximum Reaction Control System propellant temperature increase of approximately 2°F. The corrective action for Apollo 17 will be to remove the paint from the panels since the paint has little thermal value."
007:17:25 Peterson: Roger; copy.
007:17:28 Duke: And that's the only surface we have that looks like that, and we continually get particles shredding off from that.
007:17:32 Peterson: Roger; copy. [Long pause.]
007:17:50 Peterson: Charlie, we're having a little trouble figuring out which surface you're talking about. Can you give us a little better description of what you were talking about there?
007:17:59 Duke: Okay. We - On the plus-X side - on Ken's side - the surface right below the docking target that runs parallel to the plus-X of the LM and right into the top of the APS propellant tank.
007:18:17 Peterson: Okay. Right below the docking target, and it runs right into the top of the APS propellant tank.
007:18:23 Duke: That's affirm, and that axis is almost - ia almost parallel to the plus-X axis.
007:18:29 Peterson: Roger. [Pause.]
007:18:34 Duke: And whatever that surface was, is all shredded, and - as I said, like shredded wheat, and it's continually spitting particles off.
007:18:44 Peterson: Okay. In other words, you can see it deteriorating now, huh?
007:18:47 Duke: That's affirm. It's spitting particles off - about five or ten a second.
007:18:52 Peterson: Roger. [Long pause.]
007:19:18 Peterson: Okay, 16. We got it, and we're going to take a look at it now.
007:19:25 Duke: Okay. [Long pause.]
007:19:40 Peterson: And, 16, we've got a correction to the G&C checklist, page 9-4, whenever you get ready to copy.
007:19:48 Young: Let's catch that after the UV photos.
007:19:51 Peterson: Rog. Will do.

This is Apollo Control at 7 hours, 22 minutes. At the present time the LM Systems Engineer is going through the handbook to try to pinpoint the precise location that Charlie Duke was describing on the Lunar Module. Charlie said that they appeared to have found the surface that is giving off the particles that were reported earlier. He said that they can see about five to ten particles per second, shredding off a surface where the coating appears to have degraded, as best we can tell from his description. He says the surface looks like shredded wheat and it's spitting off particles. At the present time, we - we haven't pin pointed precisely what location he's talking about although we expect the LM systems engineer will come up with that location from the description shortly. And then the procedure will be to determine what, if any, effect the loss of that coating might have. Presumbly the concern if any exists would be for thermal considerations. Most of those coatings are on there to maintain the proper temperature conditions within the vehicle.
007:24:31 Peterson: 16, Houston.
007:24:34 Young: Go ahead.
007:24:36 Peterson: Roger. On panel 382, the Primary Glycol Evap(orator) Inlet Temp valve, we want to adjust it slowly to get that temp to about - to Evap Out to about 45 degrees.
007:24:51 Young: You want us [garble].
007:24:52 Peterson: And you'll have to go toward them.
007:24:54 Young: You want us to go into manual and set the evaporator - you want to set the temperature - to 45 with the manual while we have the waterboiler going, is that correct?
007:25:12 Peterson: That's affirmative. [Long pause.]
007:25:24 Peterson: 16, you can go ahead and set it. Move it toward Max, and you'll have to go pretty slow with it.
007:25:28 Young: Okay. Can we stand by just a minute?
007:25:31 Peterson: Affirmative.
007:25:32 Young: Thanks. I got to open up that panel and all that stuff.
007:25:35 Peterson: Roger.

007:34:41 Peterson: 16, Houston. Can you go Manual on the High Gain?
007:34:45 Duke: Roger. [Long pause.]
007:34:58 Peterson: Charlie, it was in Reacq, and it was drifting around. [LPause.]
007:35:05 Duke: Okay, it's in Manual now.
007:35:08 Peterson: Roger. We got it.
Long comm break.

This is Apollo Control at 7 hours, 38 minutes. We appear to have pinned down on the diagrams a little more precisely where the thermal skins that Charlie Duke described shredded and spitting off particles are located. Perhaps the best way to describe this would be to ask you to visualize the Lunar Module as if you were looking at the Ascent Stage of the LM facing the porch - the front porch - or the part of the LM that looks like a face, and visualize the docking target, which is on an upper surface slightly behind and to the left of the commander's position. The panels extend downward from this docking target. Would involve several square feet of area - of surface area downward to the bulbous tank that is underneath thermal skins and that protrude from the right side of the Lunar Module. We have very little data on the Lunar Module at the present time. The only data that we're monitoring is the amount of power being transferred from the Command Module to the Lunar Module. So we have very little information to go on in assessing what the effect might be. As I mentioned previously, the primary purpose of these skins, which generally consist - although they vary from place to place on the LM - generally consist of layers of coated Mylar, Kapton, which are thin plastic-like materials, the sole purpose of which is to maintain the proper temperature conditions for the equipment, tanks and so on that are underneath. Among the equipment underneath this section of the Lunar Module, is RCS System A, oxidizer and helium tanks. We understand there's also a water tank in that area. We are investigating or discussing the possibility that a leaking tank might have something to do with shredding of the material - I think that the primary concern at this time is what is causing the material to shred. Among the things that have been discussed are turning the TV on, getting the people on the ground a look. The response that Flight Director Pete Frank got to that suggestion was it probably wouldn't do us a great deal of good, although that one is still an open possibility. And the LM systems engineer is continuing to evaluate the situation and we'll be coming back with additional recommendations. At the present time Apollo 16 is 37,181 nautical miles [68,859 km] from Earth. Spacecraft velocity is down now to 9,826 feet per second [2,995 m/s].
007:41:29 Mattingly: Houston, is that close enough on that evap temp? Looks like I can't hit 45; I can hit 43 or about 46 or 7. [Pause.]
007:41:42 Peterson: Affirmative, 16. That looks good enough.

007:46:26 Peterson: 16, Houston. On this panel that you were looking at that the particles are coming off of. That's not a hard piece of structure there; that's just a thermal protection covering - a standoff - that's over the top of the RCS A system tanks. And all the RCS [System] A tanks are under there, and what we're concerned about is that one of those tanks may be leaking and affecting that thermal protection blanket on top.
007:46:54 Mattingly: Okay.
007:47:11 MCC: Okay, we are considering the possibility of taking a look ...
007:47:28 Mattingly: The - Don...
007:47:29 MCC: ...at the tank systems.
007:47:30 Mattingly: I'm not sure. The picture that we're trying to paint here is like you had painted something and then all the paint started to peel off. It's all stripping up like an old, real - like you painted an old barn and had the paint come off of it. And it's all standing out. You can see it - kind of released from the surface. And I don't know if that fits your picture or not.
007:47:41 Peterson: Roger. I think that's the way we understand it. Are you still getting those particles coming off pretty fast there now?
007:47:48 Mattingly: They're not coming off as fast as they were a while back, but maybe that's our Sun angle has changed, making them not quite as obvious.
007:47:55 Peterson: Roger.
Long comm break.
That last description came from Ken Mattingly. Ken describing the - the appearance of that thermal skin as looking like an old barn in need of paint, where the paint or whatever the coating is, is lifting up and kinda peeling back.
And our LM systems engineer, who has done a bit more digging into the nature of the skins at that portion - at that point on the LM, describes it as an aluminum skin about 4 mils [0.1 millimetre] thick and painted. So that would - would go along with the crew's description of paint peeling. This, as we mentioned previously, the skins at various portions on the LM differ. Typically they would be the Mylar type of material, but there are also skins that are aluminum.

007:51:31 Mattingly: Hey, Don. We're ready to - looks like we ought to be deactivating the primary evaporator. Did you want us to keep it on for a while or something?
007:51:40 Peterson: Stand by a minute. Negative, Ken. You can go ahead and shut her down.
007:51:50 Mattingly: All righty.

007:53:47 Mattingly: Okay, Don. We got the evaporator secured.

007:56:24 Peterson: 16, Houston. On that Panel 382, in the manual control, the mixing valve, looks like we are going to have to play with that valve every time we change attitudes. So you might just leave that panel open or closed, for the two of the fasteners, so it will be easy to get into.
007:56:41 Mattingly: Okay. Looks like that's going to be fun around the Moon, doesn't it?
007:56:47 Peterson: Rog. We are looking at that right now, Ken.
007:56:55 Mattingly: All right.
Very long comm break.
CM Tape transcript restarts at 008:00:58.
008:00:58 Mattingly (onboard): ...here now?
008:00:59 Young (onboard): Supposed to. Trying to get it in the (garble)
008:01:04 Mattingly (onboard): I'll get the second one up. How about a - an antenna angle of minus 85 and Yaw 153. Minus 85 -
008:01:19 Duke (onboard): Okay.
008:01:20 Mattingly (onboard): Yaw 153. Is it (garble)?
008:01:26 Duke (onboard): No. We got comm.
008:01:28 Mattingly (onboard): Oh! I bet that's what I heard.
008:01:44 Mattingly (onboard): (Sigh) Well, I can see I was wrong.
008:01:51 Duke (onboard): In what?
008:01:53 Mattingly (onboard): The only guys that don't understand space flight are not the flight planners (laughter).
008:01:59 Young (onboard): Yeah. The food people.
008:02:01 Duke (onboard): I'll say.
008:02:02 Mattingly (onboard): [Laughter.] They is other folks in that operation that don't understand. Well, let's see. I guess you got to cut this thing first.
008:02:15 Young (onboard): Yeah.
008:02:16 Mattingly (onboard): Scissors, John?
008:02:17 Young (onboard): Yeah. I got them.
008:02:21 Mattingly (onboard): The old head full again?
008:02:23 Young (onboard): Yeah. Really smarts. You want me to unloosen this down here? Put it right up here.
008:02:40 Duke (onboard): Okay, I've got one of those bags back here that you can (garble) orange juice in.
008:02:54 Mattingly (onboard): Put that in the trash?
008:03:02 Young (onboard): The trash bag's done untied itself.
008:03:04 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah, I ain't sure that's going to be an acceptable solution. I'm afraid I - Maybe we ought to use one of those TSBs after all. Let's try that.
008:03:18 Young (onboard): Avoid that one.
008:03:25 Mattingly (onboard): Oh, here come de Sun. Order in the courtroom; here come de Sun.
008:03:32 Duke (onboard): What did you get, Ken?
008:03:33 Mattingly (onboard): I got one. Okay, didn't realize you had one that was empty. Excuse me.
008:03:39 Duke (onboard): (Garble).
008:03:53 Mattingly (onboard): That is obviously not one of the bags for me to fill up and use for my other water stuff.
008:04:12 Mattingly (onboard): Thank you, sir.
008:04:19 Young (onboard): Guess we ought to tape the things. I don't know. Tape up the bags because if we throw them down in there loose, pretty soon we'll have so much stuff down in there we won't know what to do with them. What do you think?
008:04:32 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah. We ought to be able to make some kind of a lid to go over it. Tape a lid down or something? Don't you think?

This is Apollo Control at 8 hours, 5 minutes. Apollo 16, at the present time, is maneuvering to the proper attitude for calibrating the optics system that'll be used in a series of star sightings. These are taken routinely on the trans-Earth and translunar legs of the flight. The information is fed into the onboard guidance system and is used to update the onboard system's knowledge of so called state vector - the trajectory - that the vehicle is currently on. This data is then compared with the - with the ground figures. And as the spacecraft maneuvers into this attitude, we lose lock with the High Gain Antenna and have a momentary drop out in communications. Again, to reiterate the description that we've gotten from the crew, what appears to be paint peeling from a portion of the Lunar Module thermal skins, about 45 minutes ago or at about 7 hours and 17 minutes, Charlie Duke came on the circuit to describe the location of the Lunar Module from which a series of white particles, that have been described earlier as drifting past the Command Module, appeared to be emanating from. He said it was on the side of the Lunar Module between the omni antenna and the - one of the LM tanks, and had the appearance of skin that was torn or shredded, with particles coming off at the rate of about five to ten per second. The initial reaction here in the Control Center that was one of the Mylar or Kapton skins, which are stretched over the Lunar Module surface for maintaining the thermal control - proper temperatures within the vehicle, had shredded and it was these particles coming off. This is very fragile material physically and since the Lunar Module, of course, does not have to withstand aerodynamic forces, these - these surfaces can be very light weight and consequently are quite fragile. The initial concern was for what had shredded the material. Later, Ken Mattingly gave us a further description and also we coupled that with information from the LM systems engineer here in the Control Center. Ken's description was that the material appeared to be paint peeling back from a hard surface. The LM systems engineer verified that the skins at that point on the Lunar Module are very thin aluminum. He said that they were four mils [0.1 millimetres] thick and are painted which would indicate that the skin itself - the aluminum structure - is not damaged, but that the paint, which is also on there for thermal purposes, is apparently peeling back. At the present time, we're continuing to evaluate what effects that might have thermally on the equipment beneath the area. The panels the thermal skins are over; RCS System A - one of the two RCS systems' tanks, the oxidizer tank, helium tank and also a water tank was reported in that area. One of the things that has been discussed and is still under consideration is the possibility of having the crew enter the Lunar Module, power it up enough to give us a look at some of those systems and perhaps allow us to draw some further conclusions as to what might be happening. And as we mentioned previously, the only measurements that we have on the Lunar Module at the present time are the power measurements. We're monitoring the amount of power that is being supplied from the Command Module to the Lunar Module.
008:04:40 Young (onboard): Sock me a pill. Is there any left?
008:04:42 Duke (onboard): Yeah. Here's one right here.
008:04:56 Duke (onboard): Here you go.
008:04:57 Young (onboard): Okay. What do you have to do? Take it loose, or just...
008:05:02 Duke (onboard): Yeah. I guess. Take the paper off that thing?
008:05:08 Mattingly (onboard): No, no. No. Just stick it in the way it is.
008:05:10 Duke (onboard): Oh, really?
008:05:11 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah.
008:05:12 Duke (onboard): Hmm; I took the paper off.
008:05:13 Mattingly (onboard): No, you don't need to. You pull it out - just pull the thing out and stuff it in there and it'll be fine.
008:05:17 Young (onboard): It's not edible paper, huh?
008:05:21 Duke (onboard): I'm thinking about sticking a window shade in over here.
008:05:25 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah, you ought to have a little Sun. Well, it's really - ought to end up in here.
008:05:28 Duke (onboard): What?
008:05:29 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah.
008:05:30 Duke (onboard): The Sun?
008:05:31 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah. If you want to put that window shade in, it wouldn't be a - it would be an appropriate thing, I bet. Looks like we're about ready to - Well, we're on Omni B now (garble). maybe the high gain would pick up. Well, it's fluctuating back and forth.
008:06:06 Young (onboard): Just leave those bags out until we get a whole mess of them, and then we'll put them all in the cupboard and stuff them in there.
008:06:12 Duke (onboard): Yeah.
008:06:32 Mattingly (onboard): That is going to be a bright bear out there, isn't it?
008:06:34 Duke (onboard): Yeah.
008:06:35 Young (onboard): Yeah (garble). What are we doing?
008:06:38 Mattingly (onboard): We're getting ready to go - do a P23. I - You trying to close it or open it?
008:06:42 Duke (onboard): I was trying to close it.
008:06:43 Mattingly (onboard): Okay.
008:06:44 Duke (onboard): Go ahead.
008:06:45 Mattingly (onboard): I'll get it. Boy, that comm is less than optimum.
008:07:25 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, now. Looks like I'd better heat up that evaporator, huh?
008:07:31 Duke (onboard): That's falling off a little bit. See?
008:07:33 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. I hate to - (garble) if I put some Velcro on it - a little bit.
008:07:55 Young (onboard): Okay, Ken. You want to get down here and P23 your way through this thing?
008:07:59 Mattingly (onboard): Yes, sir. I'll be down there in just a second.
008:08:05 Young (onboard): Being a big manual guy, huh?
008:08:08 Mattingly (onboard): Huh?
008:08:48 Peterson: 16, Houston. Go to High Gain.
008:08:09 Young (onboard): Being a big manual person?
008:08:17 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, here's two (garble). You're gonna have to screw in this thing, it looks like. It's really bad that we have to play with that thing. Can you - did we stop it in the attitude?
008:08:31 Duke (onboard): Yeah, we're here.
008:08:32 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. Do you think we're gonna - you gonna be able to work on that food business while I'm down here?
008:08:42 Young (onboard): Yeah, maybe. I don't know.
008:08:46 Mattingly (onboard): I can probably work on this thing by myself, if I - Darned umbilicals.
008:08:53 Duke (onboard): Hey, Ken, could you put that in the jettison bag?
008:08:55 Mattingly (onboard): Yes, sir, (garble)
008:08:56 Duke (onboard): When you get a chance?
008:08:57 Mattingly (onboard): What is it?
008:08:58 Duke (onboard): It's all those screws and...
008:09:00 Mattingly (onboard): Oh, yeah. I was gonna - you got to wrap up this tape hanging down.
008:09:09 Duke (onboard): Well, you need - Here's two more that came off.
008:09:10 Mattingly (onboard): Oh, wait - wait a minute, I'll get some tape to hold it together.
008:09:29 Young (onboard): You've got - What? Is yours off over there, too, Charlie?
008:09:33 Duke (onboard): What's off?
008:09:34 Young (onboard): Oh, just - is it just over here underneath the docking ring that it's off?
008:09:38 Duke (onboard): Yeah. Well, I can see the edge of that panel over here and over there.
008:10:26 Peterson: 16, go High Gain.
008:10:27 Young (onboard): Yeah, it looks like some more of that gray stuff come off of it.
008:10:39 Peterson: 16, Houston. Give us a High Gain Antenna.
Long comm break.
008:10:48 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, John. I'm gonna see what I can do here. Let me see if I can find me a G&C Checklist, P23.
008:11:23 Mattingly (onboard): By golly, it's right there. Some things we do pretty well, I guess. This program has figured out how to find stars.
008:11:39 Young (onboard): Well, I'll tell you something, you guys. There may be a star out there, but I sure don't see it.
008:11:45 Mattingly (onboard): Even in the sextant?
008:11:46 Young (onboard): Oh, yeah, it's right in the middle of the sextant.
008:11:47 Mattingly (onboard): What'd you get for (garble)...
008:11:48 Young (onboard): It's (garble).
008:11:49 Duke (onboard): (Garble).
008:11:50 Young (onboard): Sure ain't in the telescope, Ken.
008:11:51 Duke (onboard): Oh...
008:11:52 Young (onboard): It's right in the sextant...
008:11:53 Duke (onboard): Oh, yeah; and it's fantastic.
008:11:54 Mattingly (onboard): But there's...
008:11:55 Duke (onboard): Oh, it's just great.
008:11:57 Mattingly (onboard): But there's just - that telescope is just useless unless you want to look at the quad or the radar.
008:12:01 Young (onboard): Yeah, but what star is it?
008:12:02 Mattingly (onboard): It's 40.
008:12:15 Young (onboard): Do you see anything leaking out over there, Charlie? Any particles coming off the LM?
008:12:20 Duke (onboard): No.
008:12:21 Young (onboard): Huh?
008:12:22 Duke (onboard): No.
008:12:23 Young (onboard): You see any particles coming off?
008:12:24 Duke (onboard): There are a few out there.
008:12:27 Young (onboard): (Garble).
008:12:29 Duke (onboard): See, you can't see -
008:12:49 Young (onboard): Yeah.
008:12:58 Young (onboard): Whatever it is, it's up in the -
008:13:14 Duke (onboard): It looks like if it had been a leak - in a propellant tank, it would have - it would have - blown up. Blown the whole thing out of there instead of shredded it.
008:13:36 Young (onboard): Okay.
008:13:44 Duke (onboard): Well, whatever it was coming out of there with full force, so it must have had some pressure behind it.
008:13:50 Young (onboard): It's still coming out of there?
008:13:56 Duke (onboard): Do you see little particles?
008:13:58 Young (onboard): Yeah.
008:14:02 Duke (onboard): Does that look like particles to you, vapor - vapor or just a...
008:14:06 Young (onboard): Yeah.
008:14:10 Duke (onboard): Is that what vapor particles look like?
008:14:11 Young (onboard): Yeah, I think.
008:14:13 Duke (onboard): Okay. Here goes.
008:14:18 Young (onboard): Houston, 16. Over.
008:14:30 Young (onboard): They reading us?
008:14:36 Young (onboard): Houston, 16. Over.
008:14:44 Duke (onboard): We've got a pretty low signal here. Let me go to the High Gain [Antenna]. Okay. You got - put it in ReAcq. There you go.
008:14:57 Young (onboard): Got them?
008:14:58 Duke (onboard): Yeah. With good signal strength.

This is Apollo Control at 8 hours, 15 minutes. The LM systems engineer has...
008:15:00 Young: Houston, this is 16. Over.
008:15:02 Peterson: Roger, 16. You're loud and clear [garble].
008:15:05 Young: Roger. I see something coming off of the Lunar Module now that I - I haven't been up here looking out the window. I just noticed - it's - it's - it looks like it's coming out of a vent or something. [End of CM transcript until Day 2 at 024:53:25.] And from looking at it through the window, it is beneath this sheet that's sort of shredded off, and it's right between the - that spiral antenna and above the big APS tank. But this is definitely coming out in a stream right now, looks like, and not very many particles, but they're just being propelled away from the Lunar Module at some velocity.
008:16:00 MCC: Okay. Roger. Let's get in there and take a look at it.
008:16:07 Peterson: Roger. I think we're going to have to get into the LM and take a look at the RCS system's gauges to tell what's going on here. Do you notice any color or anything more descriptive about that stream?
008:16:15 Young: Well, my opinion of the color is that it's a brownish material.
008:16:24 Peterson: Roger.
008:16:26 Young: And it has long - some of it has long flakes to it, and - but some of it is just little particles.
008:16:37 Peterson: Roger. [Long pause.]
008:16:52 Peterson: 16, we'd like to have a look at the LM/CM Delta-P before you start pressurizing it also.
008:17:00 Young: Okay. Do you want us to stop the P23 and go in there right now? Over.
008:17:05 Peterson: That's affirmative, 16. [Pause.]
008:17:10 Young: Okay. [Pause.]
008:17:15 Duke: Do you want us to stay in this attitude, Pete? [Long pause.]
008:17:34 Duke: And, Pete, you might be thinking about what kind of a - where you want us to enter the checklist.
008:17:40 Peterson: Roger. I understand. We'll get back to you in a minute, Charlie.
008:17:44 Duke: Rog. The Activation Checklist, I guess.
008:17:46 Peterson: Rog. [Long pause.]
008:18:21 Duke: We're up to 0.6 on the LM/CM Delta-P, which is what it was, due to our cabin pressure difference. I don't think it has leaked any.
008:18:32 Peterson: Roger. We copied; and, Charlie, we want to start on page 2-1 in the Activation Checklist.
008:18:38 Duke: Okay. [Pause.]
008:18:46 Mattingly: Pete, how about if I go to a wider dead band?
008:18:53 Peterson: We want to - first of all, Ken, we want to roll to 91 degrees, and that'll boresight the aft Omni toward the Earth, and also we want the Waste Stowage Vent valve, Closed.
008:19:06 Mattingly: Okay, now. Take it a little slower here. You wanted to do a maneuver to a roll of 90. Is that affirm?
008:19:13 Peterson: A roll of 91.
008:19:15 Mattingly: Okay. You want the other attitudes to be the same as I have now?
008:19:18 MCC: That's affirmative.
008:19:19 Peterson: That's affirmative, 16. [Pause.]
008:19:26 Mattingly: Okay, I have 91.00. And we'll use the present pitch and the present yaw, and you get the Waste Vent, Closed.
008:19:38 Peterson: Roger. The Waste Stowage Vent valve, Closed.
008:19:44 Mattingly: We've done that. Okay, we're starting our maneuver now.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 8 hours, 20 minutes and the import of that last series of exchanges with the crew, as we are instructing them to enter the Lunar Module. We'll power it up sufficiently to look at some of the systems and try to determine from the data what, if anything, out of the ordinary is happening. The additional description that we got a minute or so ago was from John Young. John described the particles coming off as, on further evaluation, to have the appearence of some sort of a vent. He said that the material appeared to have a brownish color, and appeared to be propelled away from the Lunar Module with some force. He said it was coming out in a stream, sometimes particles and sometimes as longer streams. And the main thing that we'll be looking for, when the LM is powered up, is the propellant pressures and temperatures particularly in that area of the Lunar Module.
008:22:10 Young: Okay, Houston. We're opening the LM pressurization valve now.
008:22:14 Peterson: Roger.
008:22:15 Young: [Garble.] [Pause.]
008:22:20 Young: How's it look? [Long pause.]
It appears at this point that the crew is opening the LM hatch. Total time probably would be around 15 minutes from the time they started the procedures of getting into the LM until they're in and began turning on some of the switches so that we can look at - look at those Lunar Module systems.
008:23:09 Peterson: Ken, we're also thinking about trying to get some TV looks at that venting condition, if it doesn't interfere with the activation.
008:23:19 Mattingly: Okay. I'll tell you what. We've stowed the camera aftwards. Wait until they get in the LM, and then I'll go down and get that thing out. I can do that while they're going in there.
008:23:30 Peterson: Roger; understand.

Both Charlie Duke and John Young will be entering the Lunar Module. They're in the process of doing that right now. And at the present time, Apollo 16 is 41,141 nautical miles [76,193 kilometres] from Earth, traveling at a speed of 9,298 feet per second [2,834 m/s]. We have asked Ken Mattingly to get out the TV camera and we expect that once Duke and Young are in the Lunar Module, cleared out of the way so he can get to the area where it is stowed, that he will get it out and we would expect to get a TV picture hopefully showing the area of the Lunar Module where the particles are coming from. And shortly after that, we should also get some data from the Lunar Module which is, of course, the thing of greatest interest to the controllers here in Mission Control. Particularly, they are interested in looking at the propellant pressures and temperatures of RCS System A which is in the vicinity of the Lunar Module where we're seeing the materials - particles emanating.

008:29:49 Peterson: 16, can you Zero the Optics? All you have to do is hit the switch. It's within 10 degrees.
Comm break.
008:30:59 Duke: Okay, Houston. How far along in this activation would you like us to go?
008:31:05 Peterson: Stand by a minute, Charlie.
008:31:06 Flight: Step 7, page 2-3; 2-3, step 7.
008:31:13 Peterson: Go to 2-3, Step 7, Charlie.
008:31:18 Duke: Okay. We start on 2-1, right?
008:31:21 Peterson: That's affirmative. [Long pause.]
008:31:41 Flight: INCO, Flight.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 8 hours, 33 minutes and that last transmission from Charlie Duke indicates to us that Duke and Young are in the Lunar Module going through the Activation Checklist at the present time, getting the LM partially powered up so that we can get a look at some of the critical systems, and the pertinent systems in this case, in an attempt to determine what if anything out of the ordinary is happening. And, as we mentioned previously, we do expect to get some television from the Command Module. Ken - Ken Mattingly advised us that he would be getting the camera unstowed and in operation as soon as possible.
008:34:44 Mattingly: Okay, Don. They're on their way into the LM now. And Charlie's in there and John's joining him, and I'll work on getting the TV camera out.
008:34:53 Peterson: Okay.
Comm break.
008:36:18 Young: Okay, Houston. We're going onto LM Power right now.
008:36:22 Peterson: Roger. [Pause.]
008:36:30 Young: Okay. We've gone to Reset and Off.
008:36:35 Peterson: Roger, 16.
008:36:36 Young: The time was 08:36:34.
008:36:38 Peterson: Roger. [Long pause.]
008:37:00 Peterson: And Ken, when you get the camera set up, ready to operate, we'll go to Medium beamwidth on the High Gain Antenna.
008:37:06 Mattingly: Okay, and it's going to be a few minutes.
008:37:09 Peterson: Rog. Understand.
Your browser does not support the audio element. [Download MP3 audio file. Clip courtesy John Stoll, ACR Senior Technician at NASA Johnson.]
008:39:02 Young: Okay, Houston. You should have the data now, according to our checklist.
008:39:08 Peterson: Roger. [Pause.]
008:39:12 Young: We're down through Step 7 on Page 2, 3.
008:39:17 Peterson: Roger. [Long pause.]
We have the data from the Lunar Module now. We're looking at it and we'll get an evaluation.
008:39:35 Young: Houston, can we bring up our RCS quad A and B meter, take a look at them?
008:39:42 Peterson: Stand by one. [Long pause.]
008:40:34 Peterson: 16, I guess we don't need the - the heaters. We're looking at all the data now. [Pause.]
008:40:43 Young: Okay, We didn't say "heater"; we said "meter." [Pause.]
008:40:50 Peterson: Roger; stand by. [Pause.]
008:40:56 Young: I guess we can take your word for it, that's for sure.
008:41:00 Peterson: Rog. We're - we're looking at all the data now, I think.
008:41:05 Young: Okay, fine. [Long pause.]
008:41:19 Duke: Our - our System A RCS meter, which is not powered, is at 92 percent quantity, and B is a little over 100.
008:41:32 Peterson: Roger. [Pause.]
008:41:38 Mattingly: Okay, and I'm ready to give you a TV from the outside. [Pause.]
008:41:47 Peterson: Roger, Ken. Understand.
Comm break.
Our LM Systems Engineer's report, from the data we've seen so far, that everything looks good. Looks normal, no evidence of any propellant leaks or pressura - pressurization leaks and we're standing by now for television from the Command Module.
008:42:48 Peterson: 16, based on what we're looking at, the System A pressures look okay. We don't see any problem with the tanks. [Pause.]
008:43:00 Young: Okay, but it - it sure is something strange coming out of that. I never saw anything like that on LM-4. [Pause.]
008:43:16 Young: I mean, I'm not normally a rabble-rouser; it - this just ain't - something - something funny going on here. [Long pause.]
008:43:39 Mattingly: Would you like to have the TV with the wide beam outside? [Long pause.]
008:43:55 Peterson: Yeah, Ken, I guess so. We haven't had a picture yet here.
008:43:59 Mattingly: No, I was waiting for you. You said something about some High Gain things you wanted to do, and I hadn't done any of those things yet.
008:44:05 Peterson: Oh, we wanted to go to Medium beamwidth on the High Gain, and we're ready for the pictures anytime. [Pause.]
008:44:13 Young: Well, if it looks okay to you, Houston, do you want us to fire this thing down now? [Pause.]
008:44:22 Peterson: Stand by just a minute. We're - we're going to take one last long look here, but everything looks okay so far.
008:44:28 Young: That's great. [Long pause.]
008:44:54 Peterson: 16, on Panel 16 in the LM, under the PQGS display breaker, and let's push that one in and we'll take a look at quantities. [Pause.]
008:45:07 Mattingly: Okay, Don. And do you have a picture now? I'm not going to zoom in until - until you've got a good picture.
008:45:15 Young: Okay. That one's in, and the quantities went to 100 each. [Pause.]
008:45:26 Peterson: Looks like the TV's in standby, Ken. [Pause.]
008:45:34 Mattingly: Does that help?
008:45:36 Peterson: Rog. [Long pause.]
And we are getting a black and white picture.
008:45:54 Peterson: Quantities look good, 16.
008:45:58 Young: That's affirmative; they're both 100.
008:46:02 Peterson: Okay, 16. We are ready to - to back out. You pull that breaker?
008:46:06 Young: ...back down. We'll pull the breaker first and back down. Thank you.
008:46:10 Peterson: Roger.
008:46:12 Mattingly: Okay, Don. Can you see any picture yet? [Pause.]
008:46:19 Peterson: Negative, Ken.
Comm break.
At the present time we're looking at the picture in black and white waiting for the color converter to lock up.
008:47:20 Peterson: Ken, we're still not getting a picture.
008:47:30 Mattingly: Okay: I'm in Transmit. [Pause.] Got a good monitor this time. I got FM transmitter. I got the S-Band Aux to TV.
008:47:50 Peterson: Okay, Ken. I think the TV's okay. I think the problem is here. It will take us about another minute, I guess. [Pause.]
008:48:00 Mattingly: Okay, I'll stand by. I'm gonna have to show you the part we're looking at.
008:48:05 Peterson: Roger. [Long pause.]
008:48:29 Peterson: Okay, Ken. Now we're getting a picture. [Long pause.]
008:48:53 Mattingly: Okay. Can you see the docking target, and do you have a grid? I've got a grid on my monitor that you should be able to correlate with. Do you have that available? If you don't, I'll just try to talk you in towards the frame.
008:49:09 Peterson: Stand by just a minute. [Long pause.]
008:49:37 Peterson: Ah, Ken. I guess we don't have a grid right now.
008:49:41 Mattingly: Okay. Right now, the center of my picture is just about on the center of the docking target. Does that look like your picture?
008:49:50 Peterson: Affirmative.
008:49:54 Mattingly: Okay, I'm gonna move the camera up and there is a flat surface which is now just about on the center of my picture, and it's pointing away from me. This is the one we can see it peeling off of.
008:50:05 Peterson: Roger.
008:50:07 Mattingly: I'm gonna try to zoom in on it, and I'll see the best monitor picture I can get, and you may have to talk me in on some of the other.
008:50:15 Peterson: Okay.
008:50:19 Young: Houston. Our Activation Checklist says leave the Cabin Repress breaker, Closed, but we found it Open. How do you want to play that one?
008:50:27 Peterson: Stand by me a minute, John. [Pause.] Okay, John. We want that one Opened on the way out.
008:50:37 Young: Open on the way out. Rog. [Long pause.]
008:50:56 Peterson: That's real good, Ken. Hold it right there.
008:51:03 Mattingly: I can't hang on [laughter] I'm stuck here; I'll get back with you.
008:51:09 Peterson: Okay. You had a real good picture there, where you were. [Pause.]
008:51:16 Mattingly: Okay. [Long pause.]
008:51:43 Peterson: Yeah, Ken. We're seeing the stuff coming off of there now. [Long pause.]
008:52:15 Peterson: Ken, while we are looking at it, we're trying to get a hack on whether or not there are any jets firing across that surface that would correlate with those particles coming off.
008:52:24 Mattingly: Yes, sir; there are. My A thruster seems to bang on it quite a bit. And we put the LM Power back to CSM at 08:52; I'd say about 15 seconds ago.
008:52:36 Peterson: Roger, copy. [Long pause.]
008:53:18 Mattingly: Don, are you guys through with this picture, or do you need something else?
008:53:21 Peterson: Hang on just a minute, Ken. [Long pause.]
008:53:55 Peterson: Ken, we see occasional particles come off, but we're not seeing a stream. Do you see any streaming like John was talking about earlier?
008:54:04 Mattingly: No, sir. Well, maybe - Well, you know, we're in an entirely different Sun angle now, and it's not clear to me that we don't see different things. Maybe John can take this thing and show you where it was coming from, because I didn't see it.
008:54:19 Peterson: Roger.
008:54:24 Young: Yeah, I'd be glad to - I'd be only too happy to point it out.
008:54:27 Peterson: Rog.
The volume of the first 1:24 of the following audio recording has been increased. It seems that a microphone, perhaps the PAO announcer's, has been inadvertently switched on. The air-ground conversation can be heard weakly under the atmosphere of the MOCR during this period.
Your browser does not support the audio element. [Download MP3 audio file. Clip courtesy John Stoll, ACR Senior Technician at NASA Johnson.]
008:56:34 Young: Okay, Houston. On our monitor, the place where the stuff was coming out is at A and 1 on the grid. Over.
008:56:41 Peterson: Understand; it's A-1?
008:56:47 Young: Roger. It's the upper right-hand corner of that square, A-1.
008:56:54 Peterson: Roger.
008:57:05 Mattingly: Okay. He's going to put it right in the middle of the picture.
008:57:09 Peterson: Okay. Let's try that.
008:57:11 Young: And, Pete, I'll tell you, that Cabin Pressure Relief valve - I mean the Cabin Repress valve in the LM will really give you apoplexy, boy!
008:57:20 Peterson: Roger.
008:57:26 Young: Okay. It's right in the middle.
008:57:30 Peterson: Okay, understand. It's right in the middle of the picture now. Okay. I think we're seeing some of it now.
008:57:41 Young: No. No, you aren't, Pete. What you're seeing is particles that are floating off, drifting particles.
008:57:49 Peterson: Okay. Can you see the venting now?
At this point, the audio recording returns to normal.
008:57:53 Duke: No, it stopped. When we maneuvered it out of the Sun, it stopped peeling off.
008:57:59 Peterson: Roger. [Pause.]
008:58:05 Duke: Okay, Pete. I take that back. You can see a little of it as the particles stream off. When they get out into the Sun, you can see them. And it looked like they have the same trajectory as the other ones, but it's very few right now.
008:58:20 Peterson: Roger. Kind of going out the top center, slightly right center of the picture?
008:58:28 Duke: Yeah, that's about right. Yeah.
008:58:30 Peterson: Rog.
008:58:35 Duke: Okay, I was off comm over there. How about bringing the old LMP up to speed? [Long pause.]
008:58:53 Peterson: Ken, can we roll to get this area back in the sunlight where we could have a better look at it? [Long pause.]
008:59:35 Mattingly: Okay, Pete. We're just about ready to maneuver. We are maneuvering.
008:59:39 Peterson: Okay. I guess you'll want to go back the way you came and go back to that attitude where you had good sunlight on it.
008:59:46 Mattingly: Okay, that's the P23 attitude.
008:59:49 Peterson: Roger.
008:59:51 Young: Okay, and ever so often, I see a particle come out from that region at some accelerated velocity, like it's leaving the spacecraft.
009:00:01 Peterson: Roger. [Pause.]
009:00:08 Duke: Okay, Pete, for my edification, were all the - the PAD, the blanket pressures, the helium tanks looking okay on the RCS?
009:00:18 Peterson: Affirmative. They were, Charlie. [Long pause.]
This is Apollo Control, the picture we're getting right now is the interior of the Command Module. All three crewmen back in the Command Module, now. And after the look we got at the Lunar Module, on the telemetry data, everything appeared to be normal. We've had a group of very interested engineers and project management people here in the control center, looking at the television picture. And can see very clearly the panel which had the shredded appearance what Charlie Duke described earlier as appearing like shredded wheat.
009:01:08 Peterson: Charlie, we - just as a point of verification here, did you have floodlights when you went into the LM? We didn't show any - any current drain when you went in there.
009:01:17 Duke: Yes, sir. Just like the refrigerator, it came right on, with the hatch about a quarter of the way open. And when I went to All, we had all the floodlights.
009:01:28 Peterson: Roger. [Pause.]
009:01:34 Duke: But you can see a lot better over here when you take your shades off.
009:01:38 Peterson: Rog [laughter]. [Long pause.]
009:01:50 Duke: And, Pete, every time the - one of the Command Module, Service Module, RCS plus-X jets fires towards that - that one over the hatch here, it really blows that stuff off.
009:02:05 Peterson: Roger; copy.

009:03:24 Young: Okay, Houston. As of this moment, that area is completely free of particles. It wouldn't do you any good to show you any TV of it, because it's not doing anything.
009:03:33 Peterson: Roger; copy. [Long pause.]
009:04:33 Peterson: Okay, John. I guess that's about all the data we're going to get. We're going to have to think that over a while, so we'll go ahead and stow the TV camera and get back to the Flight Plan.
009:04:44 Young: Yes, sir. It's certainly an unusual thing; and, furthermore, it's very strange how this upper surface here has flaked off behind the - behind the - docking target, which I guess you - you can't see that on the TV. I couldn't see it on the monitor. Can you see it on the TV?
009:05:11 Peterson: We get a pretty good look at a portion of it. Looks like a lot of, like Charlie said, shredded wheat.
009:05:21 Young: Yeah, it looks like about a half - a half inch or an inch of grass growing out of the - of the surface there.
009:05:27 Peterson: Yeah, we got a pretty good look at that.
009:05:32 Young: Okay.
009:05:34 Peterson: I don't think we know what it means yet, but we did get a good look at it.
009:05:38 Young: Rog. [Long pause.]
009:05:53 Young: Charlie might say that looks Ba-a-ad.
009:05:59 Duke: You're right [laughter]. [Long pause.]
009:06:18 Duke: Did you have a TV picture of the cockpit there? [Pause.]
009:06:23 Peterson: Affirmative; real briefly there.
009:06:26 Duke: [Laughing] That's what I was afraid of. [Long pause.]
009:06:43 Peterson: Okay, 16. We'd like to get the Waste Stowage Vent valve, Open, again now. [Long pause.]
009:07:05 Duke: And, Pete, the Lunar Module looks very clean. There was very few particles in it, and that's just about it. Over.
009:07:15 Peterson: Roger; understand. And, Char - Charlie, we'd like to go into the Flight Plan here at 12:15 and delete closing the Vent - Waste Stowage Vent valve, and move that to 13:15.
009:07:30 Duke: Okay; we're moving it to 13:15.
009:07:34 Peterson: Roger.

This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 8 minutes. Again, to recap the situation after having the crew get in, power up the Lunar Module and taking a look at the external area where the material on the skin was shredding, particles were coming out. We can find nothing obviously wrong and that's obviously reassuring to have all of the data on the propellant tanks, and the pressures and quantities looking normal. At the present time, the thing that we're looking into is the possibility of an unusually large number of jet firings at some point from the Command Module Reaction Control System thrusters that might have perhaps degraded or burned the surface or chemically caused it to peel up the way it appeared to be in the television picture. But, I would say at this point that there is somewhat of a relaxed or at least not overly tense mood in the Control Center and certainly it was reasuring to see all of the - the data looking good when we did power up the Lunar Module. Apollo 16 at the present time is 44,921 nautical miles [83,193 kilometres] from Earth and the spacecraft velocity, continuing to drop off slowly; down now to 8,851 feet per second [2,698 m/s]. And Charlie Duke reported also that the Lunar Module looked extremely clean when they got inside. No particles floating around. There have been times in the past where the Lunar Module has had particles, on one occasion, from some docking tunnel insulation that had gotten in there and also have been occasion where when the LM was depressurized, glass covers on some of the instruments had broken. But, apparently no problems of that nature. As Duke reported, the LM looked very clean.
At the point the crew will pick up their Flight Plan, they'll be about one hour, perhaps a little bit more, behind where they would have been had this problem not cropped up. This is, however, a relatively slack period in the Flight Plan. We would expect them to be able to make up the time without a great deal of difficulty. They're scheduled to be taking some navigation sightings through the Command Module optics system. These will be used to update the onboard guidance system's knowledge of its position and trajectory.

This is Apollo Control. As a point of interest, that entire exercise in the Lunar Module took about one hour. We reached the conclusion here in the Control Center that we were going to ask the crew to enter the LM at about 8 hours, 13 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. A couple of minutes after that John Young came up with a further report of what appeared to be particles venting from the LM which reinforced and further confirmed the decision to go into the Lunar Module. The crew, Young and Duke, to our best estimate were in the LM by 8 hours, 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and spent about 16 minutes in the Lunar Module, during which time we got a good long look at all of the critical systems and could find nothing out of the ordinary. And again, to repeat Charlie Duke's description, the LM looked extremely clean and that his evaluation would apply equally as well to what we saw on the ground and what the crew saw onboard.
009:19:31 Peterson: 16, for your information, we're not going to do Midcourse Correction l, and we're looking at about 12 feet per second on Midcourse Correction 2.
009:19:42 Mattingly: That's great.
And CapCom Don Peterson has just advised the crew that Midcourse Correction Number 1 will not be required. That opportunity for the midcourse is scheduled at 11 hours, 39 minutes. And by the time we get around to the opportunity of Midcourse Correction Number 2, the amount of velocity change it appears would be required at somewhere on the order of 12 feet per second. By dropping Midcourse Correction 1, of course, that will give the crew a bit of help in making up the time that was lost in going into the Lunar Module and we would expect that they would have most of that time made up by the time they're ready to begin their rest period. Apollo 16 at this time is 45,817 nautical miles [84,853 kilometres] from Earth and traveling at a speed of 8,750 feet per second [2,667 m/s].

This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 58 minutes. We've had virtually no conversations with the crew since they completed the exercise in checking out the Lunar Module, some 45 minutes or so ago. And it's been relatively quiet here in the Control Center. We've had no further discussions of the problem, or apparent lack of a problem with Lunar Module. The situation, to recap, began prior to this shift's coming on, shortly after the Translunar Injection with a crew report of particles apparently coming off the Lunar Module. And at the time it was not known where they were coming from or what the nature of them might be. At Ground Elapsed Time of 7 hours, 17 minutes Charlie Duke came on the circuit and reported that the white particles appeared to be coming from a portion of the Lunar Module below the docking target, and this would be on the right side of the LM as you are facing the Lunar Module looking towards the front porch and what's commonly or frequently described as the face of the Lunar Module ascent stage. He described the surface as having an appearence of paint or coating, peeling and giving the texture of shredded wheat. The immediate reaction here in the Control Center was one of concern for the possible thermal effects that this might have since the skin is on the Lunar Module, primarily to provide thermal protection to the tanks and electrical equipment, so on, underneath. And it was also a matter of concern as to what might have shredded the skin or coating. We had very little data from the Lunar Module at this time. The only information we had was the amount of electrical current being provided from the Command Module to the LM. At about 8 hours, 13 minutes after evaluating the possibilities and determining that the skin was over an area of the Lunar Module which contained the Reaction Control System thruster tankage for RCS system A. It was decided here in the Control Center to recommend to the crew that they enter the Lunar Module, power it up and let us take a look on the telemetry at the pertinent tanks, pressures, temperatures, and so on. It was also decided to request that Ken Mattingly unstow the television and give us a look at the exterior of the LM. Shortly after this at 8 hours, 15 minutes John Young gave us a further report which perhaps increased the level of concern here in the Control Center a bit. Young reported that the particles did appear to represent venting. He said he could see them coming out with some force in a stream as if they were being propelled away from the LM. At this time we passed up to the crew the request that they get into the Lunar Module and power it up partially to let us take a look the other telemetry at those systems. About 15 minutes later, at about 8 hours, 30 minutes; Young and Duke were in the Lunar Module and reported that they had switched over to LM power, and shortly thereafter we got a good solid look at the telemetry data. And everything looked fine - all of the tank pressures were normal, the quantities were normal, and the temperatures were also normal. We looked at the telemetry long enough to assure the LM systems engineers that we had had no leaks and that there were no leaks in progress, and there was nothing to indicate any problem whatsoever. Charlie Duke on coming out of the Lunar Module reported that everything inside looked very clean, and at about that time we also got television picture from the Command Module camera which Ken Mattingly was operating and could see here in the Control Center a very clear picture of the few square feet of panels that were involved on the Lunar Module. These are aluminum skins about 4/1000 of an inch [0.1 millimetres] thick, and they are painted. And the description that Charlie Duke appeared - gave appeared to be very accurate. The TV picture that we saw here in the Control Center indeed looked very much like shredded wheat. The surface had the paint curling up as if it had grass growing on it, or shreds of shredded wheat on the surface scattered around on what should have been a smooth relatively shiny surface. Seeing nothing to explain the problem. The last thought that was discussed here in the Control Center was the possibility that some effect from one of the Reaction Control System thrusters on the Command Module [means Service Module] had caused the surface to degrade - possibly heat or chemical components, or something of that nature, and there appeared to be no problem associated with it. There's been no further discussion since that time, and appears to be no further concern at the moment over what could have been a problem. The crew is presently involved in a series of star sightings, using the optical equipment, the sextant on the Command Module. Ken Mattingly is performing this exercise, taking sightings on a series of four stars, and then marking, pushing a button which enters the information into the Command Module guidance system.
010:04:27 Peterson: Affirmative. Still with you.
010:04:30 Mattingly: Okay. Hey, let me give you a couple of comments here in real time so you can write them down. Yeah, one of the things that had been mentioned was this business about reflections in the sextant when you're doing P23s, and I've got a - gee it's a beautiful picture of the Earth's horizon; the optics are just super, and we've got a - got a - what looks like an inverted - sort of like a mirror image - in the opposite side away from the horizon. It's really quite obvious...
010:05:06 Peterson: That's in the ...
010:05:07 Mattingly: ...and you can just see the bright areas.
010:05:10 Peterson: Roger. That's in the sextant.
010:05:11 Mattingly: And it's about - yeah, it's just in the sextant, and it's about - oh, I don't know how to give you a percentage of the intensity, but it is much less intense than - than the thing in the Earth. That's - that's very bright. And the star is - gee, the match between the Earth horizon as seen through the fixed line of sight and the star line of sight is just perfect. It's really nice. The only thing I can't see as well as I'd like is the crosshairs, and with the illumination turned up to full bright, they just don't stand out when the old Earth is in the field of view. When I get them down against the Earth itself, then I can see the dark line, but when I get it out in the sky beyond the Earth's horizon, I just don't see it as well as I'd like.
010:06:03 Peterson: Roger. Copy.
010:06:06 Mattingly: And, as you probably noticed there, we used that little adaptive short P23 erasable program, which is really swift; that thing just fires these things off, and I don't feel like in any way we're having to take short cuts on the pointing accuracy. The only time it takes now is to dress up the substellar point on initial acquisition. That's what we're doing now, and it seems to take quite a while.
010:06:37 Peterson: Roger. [Long pause.]
That was Ken Mattingly.
010:07:16 Mattingly: Next time we design a spacecraft, Don, we should remember not to put the optics in the kitchen.
010:07:23 Peterson: Roger. Understand.
Long comm break.
That was Ken Mattingly giving a subjective evaluation of the optics and the program used in computing these midcourse navigations. Mattingly noted that there was a reflection in the CSM sextant, the optical device that he was looking through in lining up a star, in this case over the Earth horizon. Once the star is lined up in the proper position, Mattingly pushes a button and the computer automatically notes the time and the angle between the star and the Earth horizon. And from this computes and updates its knowledge of the spacecraft position's trajectory. Mattingly noted that the - there did appear to be some - somewhat of a reflection in the optics and he said it's primary affect was that it tended to wash out the cross hairs but that this was not particularly a problem. He said it was not as clean as he would like it, but we can verify it from the results that he's getting which we're watching here on the ground, but he is indeed having no problems, the Flight Activities Officer who is watching the entries that are made into the computer said that the data that Mattingly is getting is better than was expected preflight.
The original transcript for the following two utterances attribute them to Young. I suspect we are hearing the Flight Director inadvertently coming onto the air/ground circuit as has happened previously on this mission.

This is Apollo Control. Ken Mattingly is still involved in taking the midcourse sightings through the CSM sextant. On completing that activity the Flight Plan becomes relatively unencumbered. We don't have very many additional scheduled activities and we expect that the crew will be able to make up the hour that was lost in getting into the Lunar Module and checking - checking out what appeared to be a possible problem resulting from - noting that the - one of the skins on the Lunar Module was peeling and the material flaking off and the possibility that something underneath - one of the tanks or something connected with the LM thrusters and Reaction Control System was possibly venting and as we mentioned previously on getting into the Lunar Module, checking things out, everything appeared to be normal. The one thing that we did notice when we had the television on the area of the LM which was affected, one of the aluminum panels several square feet in area, was that when one of the thrusters on the CSM was firing and in particular forward firing Service Module thruster that the material which had flaked off appeared to be disturbed and this would cause it to float off or to be propelled away from the Lunar Module. Flight Director Pete Frank feels that the most likely effect of the thruster is in disturbing the degraded surface and he feels that it is less likely that the thruster impinging on the surface itself actually caused the problem, although at this point any - any hypothesis as to what what caused the degradation of this thermal skin is purely speculative. We've seen nothing in the data to indicate any problem; however, the skin does appear abnormal and we have no explanation for it at this point. The midcourse correction maneuver which was in the Flight Plan, the opportunity for that midcourse correction at 11 hours, 39 minutes will not be required. The spacecraft is very close to the preplanned trajectory. The Flight Dynamics Officer reported that a maneuver of only about 8 feet per second would be required. This is so small that it will not be performed at this opportunity, but will be allowed to continue until the second midcourse correction opportunity at which time the amount of change in velocity that would be required would have grown to only about 12 feet per second. By deleting this midcourse correction that reduces the amount of things that the crew has to accomplish before their rest period which is scheduled to begin about four and a half hours from now and makes it appear quite likely that they will back on the normal Flight Plan by that time. At 100 or rather 10 hours, 27 minutes; this is Apollo Control, Houston.

This is Apollo Control at 10 hours, 57 minutes. The Flight Activities Officer has just reported that the crew is completing the midcourse navigation exercise using Program 23. After that, they will align the spacecraft guidance platform which is used as an attitude reference. Flight Activities Officer said that they will be back on the normal Flight Plan prior to the time that they're scheduled to begin their rest period. There's been no further discussion here in the Control Center of the peeling thermal skin on the Lunar Module. The data that we saw when John Young and Charlie Duke entered the Lunar Module and powered it up partially pretty well removed any concern that any of the tanks were leaking or that we had any thermal problems associated with that peeling skin. The only thing that we can connect with it at the moment is that when one of the forward-firing thrusters on the CSM was activated, we could see the particles fly off the panel and move outward from the Lunar Module. But as Flight Director Pete Frank put it, we don't necessarily know that the thruster was the cause of the problem. The only thing we can say at the moment is that it's very perplexing as to what caused the skin, or the paint on the skin to degrade. But at this time, there's no undue concern about it. And again, to repeat, all of the data that we've seen, the reports from the crew and what we could see on the television picture that was transmitted back to us, indicates that we have no problem with the Lunar Module at the present time. Apollo 16 at this time is 53,562 nautical miles from Earth, and the velocity has now dropped below 8,000 feet per second. We're down now to 7,989 feet per second, and we'll see that velocity continue to drop off until we reach the point that the spacecraft passes into the Moon sphere of influence where the dominant effect of the Moon's gravity begins to speed us up again toward the Moon.
010:59:26 Peterson: 16, Houston.
010:59:29 Young: Go ahead, Don.
010:59:30 Peterson: Rog; we are going to dilute - delete that maneuver to thermal attitude that's coming up in the Flight Plan at about 9:30 - in the Flight Plan. And also, when you get a chance, we want you to zero Noun 26, because there's a possibility that if you hit a Noun 30 with what you got in Noun 26 now, you'll get a transfer to a wrong place in the program. [Pause.]
010:59:58 Young: Understand. Zero Noun 26.
011:00:02 Peterson: Roger. [Long pause.]
011:00:32 Young: Boy, you guys are reading our minds up there, or down there. [Pause.]
011:00:43 Young: What do you want to do? Just go right into PTC?
011:00:48 Peterson: Negative; we're going to do the P52 that's at - down around 10:40 in the Flight Plan.
011:00:55 Young: Understand. And then go to PTC, huh? [Pause.]

This is Apollo Control at 11 hours, 59 minutes; and it's continued rather quiet here at Mission Control. We've had relatively few conversations with the crew aboard Apollo 16 in the last 45 or 50 minutes. The activities aboard the spacecraft have been primarily housekeeping sorts of things. Dumping the waste water; these tanks gradually fill up from excess water produced by the fuel cells and at a given level, they are dumped back down to about ten percent of their capacity. The crew has aligned the guidance platform used as a reference for attitude. They'll be changing out the lithium hydroxide canister that - one of the canisters that removes carbon dioxide from the spacecraft atmosphere. They also purged the fuel cells, running oxygen through the fuel cells at a high flow rate to remove any impurities. And they're scheduled to be taking another series of ultraviolet photographs of Earth. Prior to beginning their rest period, they'll also set the spacecraft up in the so-called Passive Thermal Control mode where the entire vehicle is rotated about its longitudinal axis at the rate of about three revolutions per hour to maintain the proper temperature equilibrium. And they're scheduled to begin their sleep period in about three hours. At the present time, Apollo 16 is 58,133 nautical miles [107,662 km] from Earth and traveling at a speed of 7,604 feet per second [2,318 m/s].
012:01:14 Peterson: 16, could you give us a reading on LM/CM Delta-P? [Long pause.]
012:01:39 Young: Rog. LM/CM Delta-P is 0.2, which is what it was in the altitude chamber, and that apparently zero on our gauge.

012:57:11 Young: Roger. Waste Stowage Vent going Closed now. [Long pause.]
012:57:29 Mattingly: Houston, how do the rates look to you for going into PTC now?
012:57:34 Peterson: Stand by one, and we'll take a look. [Long pause.]
012:57:47 Peterson: The rates look good and you can go ahead into PTC.
012:57:51 Mattingly: Roger.

This is Apollo Control at 13 hours. Apollo 16 will shortly be going into its Passive Thermal Control mode with the spacecraft rotating at about the rate of three revolutions per hour to maintain proper temperatures. And we do have from the Flight Dynamics Officer now a preliminary estimate on the time and location that the Saturn third stage, the S-IVB, will impact the Moon. This event is tentatively now expected to occur at 75 hours, 6 minutes, 28 seconds. And the preliminary target point - we expect that this will change somewhat as we get additional tracking on the Saturn stage - is latitude 1 degree, 12 minutes north; 22 degrees, 38 minutes west. This is about seven and a half degrees off of the planned target point, 30 degrees west was the nominal impact point for the S-IVB, but as I said, we expect that these coordinates will be updated as we get additional tracking on the vehicle. We're now essentially back on the Flight Plan and having made up the approximately one hour that was lost in going into the Lunar Module earlier to check the Lunar Module after it was noted that paint was flecking from one of the thermal control panels - one of the aluminum skins on the Lunar Module. And we've essentially now made up that time with the crew back on the regular Flight Plan.
013:02:11 Peterson: 16, we're going to let you get in - well into the PTC here. And monitor - the primary loop rad out temps and let it stabilize, and then it may be necessary to go down to Panel 382 and adjust it again to try to keep that temperature at about 45 degrees Fahrenheit.
013:02:30 Mattingly: Okay.
013:02:33 Peterson: And, Ken, if we have to do that, we'd suggest you mark a place down there so that, during the subsequent, PTCs you can just set the thing to that mark.
Comm break.
013:04:30 Peterson: 16, go Omni Bravo and we'll take over switching it for you. [Pause.]
013:04:40 Young: You've got Omni Bravo.

013:10:51 Duke: Hey, Don.
013:10:53 Peterson: Go. [Pause.]
013:10:58 Peterson: Go ahead, Ken.
013:11:03 Mattingly: You would really love this sight. We're - as we rotate around now, we've got the - the Earth out the window Number 1, and it's about - oh, almost - not quite down to half. And you can see India and the continent, and it's covered with clouds, and no photograph can ever describe the way it looks. It's really super.
013:11:27 Peterson: It really sounds fantastic. Wish I were there.
013:11:31 Mattingly: Yes, sir. You would love it.
013:11:36 Young: You can see all of Australia, too. It's really something else.
013:11:41 Peterson: About what size does the Earth look from where you are? [Long pause.]
013:11:55 Young: Looks like it's about - it's approximately 4000 miles in radius.
013:12:00 Peterson: Hey, that's a pretty good estimate.
013:12:04 Mattingly: No, it's - it didn't quite fill the window. Well, I'm not - I'm about - I'm about three - my eyes are about three feet from the window, and it didn't quite fill it.
013:12:15 Peterson: Rog. [Pause.]
013:12:25 Mattingly: You know, a sight like that goes a long ways to make tomato soup taste good.
013:12:30 Peterson: Yeah, that's what I've heard. [Long pause.]
013:13:00 Mattingly: I hate - Don, I hate to belabor the point, but I would appreciate it if the guys that are working on the RCS budgeting and all could take a look and - and see if they could determine if there was any place where we were going over more than what they might have expected for that phase.
013:13:22 Peterson: Okay; we'll have them take a look. [Long pause.]
013:13:44 Peterson: Okay, Ken; for your info, they said you were slightly ahead following LM extraction and apparently we used a little excess during the P23s.
013:13:56 Mattingly: Okay; that - that - that stands to reason; that not being able to see the reticle on there is a real nuisance. You can do it, and it's - I guess there is also a certain amount of getting used to the knack of flying that thing around. It's - for some reason, it seems a little bit different to find the attitude than it was in the simulator; but the biggest nuisance was the inability to see the reticle, but if that's where we used our extra, that's fine.
013:14:26 Peterson: Okay.

This is Apollo Control at 14 hours and we're in the process of a shift handover here in Mission Control. Flight Director Gerry Griffin and his team of flight controllers coming on now to relieve the Pete Frank team. And we do expect to have a change of shift press briefing. That will begin in about 15 minutes and will be held in the MSC News Center Briefing room. Apollo 16 at the present time is 66,450 nautical miles [123,065 km] from Earth and the spacecraft velocity is 6,990 feet per second [2,130 m/s].

014:02:52 Mattingly: Ah, this is really a ball, Henry. [Pause.] Hey - much as I hate to say it, this PTC doesn't look so red hot to us. Can you give us any clues whether it's gonna hack it or not?
014:03:11 Hartsfield: Okay. Stand by. [Long pause.]
014:03:36 Hartsfield: 16, Houston. We don't see anything down here that's causing it divert - to diverge, but it does look marginal. We're gonna keep an eye on it. [Pause.]

014:14:55 Mattingly: Okay; 11841. [Long pause.]
014:15:50 Hartsfield: Apollo 16, Houston. We want to still keep working on this SPS gauging problem. We'd like to get a readout if we could on your SPS fuel and oxidizer pressures. [Pause.]
014:16:06 Young: Okay, stand by. [Long pause.]
014:16:46 Young: Okay, that fuel pressure is reading right now 168. Oxidizer pressure is in the green, and it's reading 1 - 186 or 87.
014:17:07 Hartsfield: Roger. Understand, 168 and 186. [Pause.]
014:17:14 Young: That's affirm, isn't it? And we were told this morning before launch that that was nominal.
014:17:22 Hartsfield: Roger.
014:17:24 Young: Because - because of a bias in the gauge. So we're probably gonna need some kind of a - another Delta-P figure to go on our LOI card - I mean our midcourse card.
014:17:40 Hartsfield: That's affirmative, and it's in work.
014:17:43 Young: Yes, sir. [Pause.]
014:17:48 Mattingly: And I think I show we have just at 15 percent waste water, but we are gonna go ahead and chlorinate unless you think the EECOMs don't want that. [Pause.]
014:18:04 Hartsfield: Stand by, Ken. [Long pause.]
014:18:33 Hartsfield: 16, Houston. We're - we're not sure we understand your question here. If you're asking if it's okay to chlorinate the potable, that's - that's good.
014:18:42 Mattingly: Okay. Just wanted to make sure if you ever need a waterboiler, people don't like to put the chlorine in there, so I just thought I'd check with you before I did it. [Pause.]
014:18:55 Hartsfield: Okay, I copy now. [Pause.] They say still press ahead, Ken.

014:31:07 Mattingly: Well, Henry, sometime back there during the day, I opened up the flow line to my hoses that had been turned off and laid them around to try and get some better ventilation in here. But I don't remember whether that was about the same time or not.
014:31:26 Hartsfield: Okay. We're not concerned; we're just trying to answer the question. That's probably what it was.

014:52:03 Hartsfield: Roger. The - your first part of your transmission was blocked out. We had a antenna switch. However, on the PTC, guess he thinks it will go throughout the sleep period, and then we'll reinitialize after you wake up. But he doesn't think it'll go a full 16 hours, but it's good for the sleep period. [Pause.]
014:52:25 Mattingly: Okay. The first thing you said was we'll go without the tone booster. We'll go with normal comm delay.
014:52:36 Hartsfield: Okay.
014:52:38 Mattingly: That's for caution and warning part. [Long pause.]
014:53:03 Hartsfield: And, Ken, did you use anything out of mag Juliet Juliet?
014:53:07 Mattingly: That's negative.
014:53:10 Hartsfield: Roger. [Long pause.]
014:54:02 Mattingly: Okay, Henry. Are there any onboard read-outs that you folks would like to have?
014:54:10 Hartsfield: Negative, Ken, I think we're all in good shape here. Everything looks good at this point. You got anything else for us? [Pause.]
014:54:20 Mattingly: No, I'm just looking ahead, and I've got five and a half minutes to go to sleep.
014:54:29 Hartsfield: Rog. Why don't you take that? Y'all did a real good day's work. Only two things left to do are those two comm switches, the Squelch and the Normal Mode Voice. Get a good night's sleep, and we'll see you tomorrow. [Pause.]
014:54:44 Mattingly: Yes, sir. This is - this doesn't come under work category.
Very long comm break.
And the communications officer here in Mission Control has reported that the crew has indeed turned off the voice switch onboard the spacecraft, and are settling in for a night's sleep. The spacecraft analysis status report, dated at 14 hours Ground Elapsed Time, less than an hour ago; most of the entries state no change or performance is normal. For example, in propellant usage on the CSM Reaction Control System propellants, they are now 349 pounds [158 kg] over the predicted budget for this time in the flight. Fuel cells are working normally. All the cryogenic tankage are in normal condition. The S-band High Gain Antenna was stowed at 12 hours, 48 minutes; prior to the time they set up the rotisserie or Passive Thermal Control barbecue mode in which they spin at about 3 revolutions per hour to stabilize the thermal response of the spacecraft. Although their quantities of hydrogen and oxygen are well within predicted limits, batteries are all up operating normally, with the required amp-hours loaded. About a half hour ago, there was a brief discussion of the change - a slight change or drop noted in the suit compressor Delta-P or differential pressure when they changed the lithium hydroxide canister. These lithium hydroxide canisters scrub the carbon dioxide from the cabin atmosphere. There was no concern voiced however, by the flight control team and it was merely a matter of curiosity. Apollo 16 now 70,213 nautical miles [130,034 km] out from Earth. Velocity, 6,744 feet per second [2,055 m/s]. Crew has signed off for the night and unless some reason arises to talk either back to Mission Control or for the flight control team to contact the crew, we shouldn't hear from them for the next eight hours. At 14 hours, 58 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.

This is Apollo Control, 16 hours and 1 minute Ground Elapsed Time. Crew of Apollo 16 having some 6 hours, 58 minutes remaining in their programmed sleep period. About 20 minutes ago, the Flight Surgeon reported that, from his biomedical telemetry, that none of the crew was asleep at that time and that apparently Mattingly, because of a somewhat higher heart rate, was probably doing some exercising. For those persons who are interested in numbers and statistics, the halfway point in distance for Apollo 16, that is from surface to surface, Earth-Moon, will take place at a Ground Elapsed Time of 25 hours, 20 minutes when the distance to both bodies, Earth and the Moon, will be 104,676 [nautical] miles [193,859 km]. The halfway point in time between lift-off and Lunar Orbit Insertion will be at 37 hours, 14 minutes and 18 seconds; at which time the spacecraft will be 135,502 [nautical] miles [250,949 km] from Earth and 78,778 [nautical] miles [145,896 kilometres] from Moon. The so-called sphere crossing, where the spacecraft leaves the Earth's influence and enters into the Moon's gravitational influence - this is an arbitrary point in space, actually, where the displays here in the Control Center become Moon-referenced - will take place at 59 hours, 13 minutes, 26 seconds; and the distance from the Earth will be 178,646 [nautical] miles [330,852 km]. From the Moon; 33,820 [nautical miles, 62,634 km]. Midcourse Correction burn Number 1 was not done, and the present predicted change of velocity for Midcourse 2, should the option be exercised for a maneuver at this time, would be 12.7 feet per second [3.9 m/s]; a two-second burn with the SPS. This would be at 30 hours, 39 minutes; however, no decision on Midcourse 2 has been made and probably won't be for many hours to come. Apollo 16 presently is 74,420 nautical miles [137,825 km] out from Earth, continuing to decelerate. Velocity now; 6,487 feet per second [1,977 m/s]. And at 16 hours, 4 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.

This is Apollo Control at 17 hours, 1 minute Ground Elapsed Time; slightly under six hours remaining now in the Apollo 16 crew rest period. Spacecraft is now 77,898 nautical miles [144,267 km] out from Earth. Velocity now 6,288 feet per second [1,916 m/s]. In a continuing refinement of the predicted S-IVB impact statistics, we have yet another set of numbers. The lastest predicted impact for the S-IVB stage on the lunar surface is at 0.93 north latitude by 22.35 west longitude at a Ground Elapsed Time of 75 hours, 6 minutes, 22 seconds. These figures likely will be updated as more tracking is obtained and processed on the S-IVB. Apollo 16 continuing the Passive Thermal Control mode, PTC barbeque roll. No further communications from the crew of Apollo 16 since they signed off sometime ago. And at 17 hours, 3 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.

This is Apollo Control, 19 hours and 1 minute Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 16. Apollo 16 presently 84,895 nautical miles [157,225 km] out from Earth. Velocity 5,920 feet per second [1,804 m/s], continuing to decelerate. While it may be a little premature, the space flight meteorology group here in Mission Control is already forecasting that the splashdown weather conditions, some 12 days away here, are going to be good. Possibly a few rain showers in the area near Christmas Island. Some four hours remaining in the crew's sleep period. Spacecraft still in the Passive Thermal Control mode. Will be in that Bar-B-Que role for a total of about 16 hours. At 19 hours, 2 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.

This is Apollo Control, 20 hours and 1 minute Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 16. Some 3 hours remaining in the scheduled sleep period for the crew. Spacecraft is now some 88,262 nautical miles [163,461 km] distant from Earth. Velocity now 5,755 feet per second [1,754 m/s]. The numbers for the predicted S-IVB impact continue to vary as the tracking is further refined. The latest numbers from the Flight Dynamics Officer gives an estimate of impact at 2 degrees, 16 minutes north latitude by 23 degrees, 11 minutes west longitude with an impact time of 75 hours, 7 minutes and 4 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. And this will likely change several more times before the actual impact. At 20 hours, 2 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.

This is Apollo Control; 21 hours, 1 minute Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 16. The Apollo 16 spacecraft is now 91,524 nautical miles [169,502 km] out from Earth. Velocity now 5,602 feet per second [1,707 m/s]. Apollo 16 crew at this time apparently all sleeping rather well. They signed off just before 3 am CST for the scheduled eight-hour sleep period. According to flight surgeon Dr. Sam Pool, Young and Mattingly were awake for perhaps an hour past the signoff time and Duke still an hour beyond that. Only two of the crewmen are hooked up to the biomedical telemetry, but as Dr. Pool mentioned, apparently all three are asleep. But it's not too easy to determine the quality of sleep from the telemetry that he sees on the flight surgeon's console. The best description of the quality of the sleep is from the crewmen themselves after they wake up. And at 21 hours, 2 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.

This is Apollo Control; 22 hours, 1 minute Ground Elapsed Time in the flight of Apollo 16. Here in Mission Control, the flight control team of Gene Kranz is being briefed for the next eight-hour shift, as Gerry Griffin's Gold Team plans to - makes preparations for retiring 'til tomorrow morning. There will not be a change of shift press briefing with the Gold Team Flight Director and as much as the entire shift with the exception of about the first 30 minutes have been - has consisted of the crew being asleep. Distance at this time: Apollo 16 is 94,738 nautical miles [175,455 km] out from Earth. Approaching the Moon at 5,458 feet per second [1,663 m/s]. Total spacecraft weight; 103,078 pounds [46,755 kg]. At 22 hours, 2 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.

This is Apollo Control, Houston at 22 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The handover in Mission Control between the two Flight Control teams has been completed. The team of flight controllers headed by Gene Kranz are now all onboard. Our CapCom for this shift will be astronaut Tony England. We presently show Apollo 16 at an altitude of 96,103 nautical miles [177,982 km] from Earth and travelling at a velocity of 5,399 feet per second [1,646 m/s]. Our clock in Mission Control shows that we're approximately 31 minutes away from time of crew wakeup. At 22 hours, 28 minutes continuing to monitor; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
