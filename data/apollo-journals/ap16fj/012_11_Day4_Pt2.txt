This is Apollo Control. [The] Apollo 16 spacecraft has passed behind the Moon a few seconds early according to the Loss of Signal clock in the Control Center here. To review some of the upcoming numbers with the Lunar Orbit Insertion maneuver, ignition time will be at 74:28 - 74 hours, 28 minutes, 27 seconds Ground Elapsed Time - about ten minutes from now. The total Delta-V, or velocity change, will be 2,802 feet per seconds [854 m/s] - feet per second in retrograde. Apollo 16, at the end of the burn, will be in a lunar orbit measuring 58.3 nautical miles [108 km] at pericynthion and 170 nautical miles [315 km] at apocynthion. Total burn time with the 2,000-pound thrust - 20,000-pound [89,000 Newtons] thrust Service Propulsion System engine will be 6 minutes, 14 seconds. With a successful Lunar Orbit Insertion burn, the spacecraft will be acquired again by the Manned Spaceflight Tracking Network at a Ground Elapsed Time of 74 hours, 50 minutes, 5 seconds, but in the remote chance that there is not a burn - no ignition for some reason - the time without a burn would be 74 hours, 42 minutes, eight seconds. The estimated impact time for the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V, which propelled Apollo 16 on its way to the Moon. That impact time now is 75 hours, 07 [minutes], 03 [seconds] and because of no tracking available over the last day or two, this is an estimate based on last predictions. It will not be within the field of view of the spacecraft even though they will be coming around the front side of the Moon at that time; it will be over the spacecraft's horizon. The seismometers from the earlier Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Packages left on the Moon by earlier missions will be monitored to detect the S-IVB impact, which would be equivalent to about 11 tons of TNT. Some 29 minutes away from Acquisition Of Signal, assuming a nominal Lunar Orbit Insertion burn, and 17 seconds away from ignition on Lunar Orbit Insertion. Come back up again prior to AOS, or acquisition of Apollo 16, as it comes around the east side of the Moon. And at 74:21 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
074:22:33 Young (onboard): [Garble], Charlie, [garble].
074:22:44 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble].
074:22:47 Young (onboard): This where we [garble] here?
074:22:48 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah.
074:22:50 Young (onboard): Yeah. You can turn it on [garble].
074:23:01 Mattingly (onboard): Hey, we got something in that kit that'll clear your sinuses up?
074:23:05 Duke (onboard): Yeah.
074:23:07 Young (onboard): Actifed.
074:23:08 Duke (onboard): [Garble]?
074:23:09 Young (onboard): Afrin [garble].
074:23:10 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble] you squirt in there to...
074:23:12 Duke (onboard): [Garble].
074:23:13 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah, I need to do something; this thing's getting worse.
074:23:18 Young (onboard): Well, we checked the switches three times. I guess it wouldn't hurt to check them again. (Laughter) Okay [garble]. Popped.
074:23:27 Duke (onboard): [Garble].
074:23:30 Young (onboard): It's on Panel 229 over there, Charlie. It's [garble]...
074:23:33 Duke (onboard): I ain't heard a thing pop.
074:23:34 Young (onboard): You ain't heard nothing pop?
074:23:36 Mattingly (onboard): Interplanetary LOS [garble] plain [garble].
074:23:43 Duke (onboard): Well, that'll [garble].
074:23:46 Mattingly (onboard): Okay.
074:23:47 Young (onboard): Say that did kind of head out?
074:24:22 Mattingly (onboard): Ooh. I think I was right.
074:24:29 Young (onboard): What's that?
074:24:30 Mattingly (onboard): That guy had died. My nose ain't that stopped up. All that goes through is the odors, no oxygen.
074:24:47 Young (onboard): Whew! I see what you mean. That was me.
074:24:57 Mattingly (onboard): Well -
074:25:27 Duke (onboard): It's not...
074:25:28 Mattingly (onboard): Send that out of here.
074:25:30 Young (onboard): Smells a long time [garble]. You guys are putting that on the tape, too [garble].
074:25:37 Duke (onboard): (Laughter)
074:25:38 Mattingly (onboard): Just be glad they don't have a gas inlet around here.
074:25:42 Young (onboard): That's right.
074:25:47 Mattingly (onboard): Oh, machine, do your thing. I won't badmouth you for being a marshmallow again.
074:26:12 Young (onboard): Okay. Coming on two minutes.
074:26:23 Young (onboard): [Garble] daylight, we'll see it.
074:26:27 Duke (onboard): We going to burn, we come into daylight.
074:26:29 Young (onboard): Yeah.
074:26:30 Mattingly (onboard): Don't look.
074:26:32 Young (onboard): No, don't look, we got too many - too many things going bad for us to look this time. Look after the burn. Get right there and then you get [garble]. Phew!
074:27:24 Young (onboard): Okay, gonna do it right in one minute [garble]. Stand by.
074:27:29 Duke (onboard): There it is.
074:27:30 Young (onboard): One minute. EMS [garble].
074:27:32 Mattingly (onboard): Translation Power, we don't need. The light is out. Delta-V Thrust A is coming on -
074:27:39 Mattingly (onboard): Mark.
074:27:40 Young (onboard): Okay.
074:27:55 Young (onboard): DSKY blank.
074:28:03 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, average g is on. It's counting. Looks good, though.
074:28:19 Young (onboard): 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 - 50 99...
074:28:26 Mattingly (onboard): Pro.
074:28:27 Duke (onboard): Pro.
074:28:28 Young (onboard): Took; 2, 1...
074:28:30 Duke (onboard): A's open. SPS - Okay, lights are out.
074:28:33 Young (onboard): Okay.
074:28:34 Duke (onboard): Pressure's looking good.
074:28:35 Mattingly (onboard): Stable. Bank B.
074:28:36 Duke (onboard): They're open.
074:28:37 Mattingly (onboard): I felt a - seemed like they dropped.
074:28:38 Young (onboard): Where?
074:28:40 Mattingly (onboard): Pressure is 90 on the gage.
074:28:42 Duke (onboard): Pressure's looking great here. Helium valves are open. PUGS is looking good.
074:28:50 Mattingly (onboard): I can feel that sucker bring that second bank on.
074:28:54 Young (onboard): Yeah, I felt that, too.
074:28:56 Duke (onboard): Okay. We - I see it in the reflection in the LM windows.
074:29:00 Young (onboard): Keep your eye on them, babe.
074:29:04 Duke (onboard): I am. I got them, babe.
074:29:03 Mattingly (onboard): What was the alarm at the start?
074:29:04 Duke (onboard): It went out, whatever it was. I think it was a overpressure on the SPS; now it's back nominal.
074:29:09 Mattingly (onboard): Okay.
074:29:12 Duke (onboard): Okay, fuel's running a little low. It's running about 165. Coming up on a minute.
074:29:23 Mattingly (onboard): Chamber pressure's staying, and - coming up a little bit, maybe. Up 92.
074:29:29 Duke (onboard): Mark, one minute.
074:29:31 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. Doesn't register on the g meter (laughter). Okay, gimbals are still steady.
074:29:41 Duke (onboard): Okay. Stand by -
074:29:42 Duke (onboard): Mark. Loose limit.
074:29:46 Young (onboard): [Garble].
074:29:50 Mattingly (onboard): Chamber pressure's going up a little.
074:29:56 Young (onboard): [Garble].
074:29:58 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah, I gave you bum dope. I was calling that 90, but it was 95.
074:30:01 Young (onboard): Son of a gun.
074:30:02 Mattingly (onboard): Inside.
074:30:03 Young (onboard): Inside.
074:30:05 Duke (onboard): [Garble] 130.
074:30:06 Mattingly (onboard): That's really 96 psi on the chamber pressure.
074:30:11 Duke (onboard): PUGS is looking great.
074:30:12 Mattingly (onboard): Attitudes are holding. How do the two Delta-Vs compare, John?
074:30:18 Young (onboard): Delta-Vs compare pretty close, as matter of fact.
074:30:21 Mattingly (onboard): Measurables [garble]. I mean, to go.
074:30:23 Young (onboard): Yeah, yeah.
074:30:25 Mattingly (onboard): About ten.
074:30:26 Young (onboard): Yeah, ten apart. Lot closer than in the simulator.
074:30:29 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble]. Okay.
074:30:30 Duke (onboard): Mark, two minutes.
074:30:31 Young (onboard): [Garble].
074:30:32 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble] coming down.
074:30:41 Mattingly (onboard): Trim's [garble]. Chamber pressure, 97.
074:30:47 Young (onboard): Okay. What's the cut-off?
074:30:49 Mattingly (onboard): BMAGs look good.
074:30:50 Duke (onboard): Four - about 04:15.
074:30:51 Mattingly (onboard): Four - yeah. 04;30.
074:30:52 Duke (onboard): 04:20, actually.
074:30:53 Young (onboard): Yeah. You're gonna make me nervous [garble].
074:30:57 Mattingly (onboard): When I say what?
074:30:59 Duke (onboard): Mark; 02:30.
074:31:01 Young (onboard): Okay.
074:31:05 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble]...
074:31:06 Duke (onboard): CMC's right on, with my time. PUGS is about 100, unbalanced, and holding. Decrease.
074:31:21 Young (onboard): [Garble]. Looks like it's working, doesn't it?
074:31:22 Mattingly (onboard): Man, it sure does.
074:31:24 Duke (onboard): Okay, coming up on 3 minutes...
074:31:25 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble]. (laughter). Chamber pressure...
074:31:29 Duke (onboard): Mark.
074:31:30 Mattingly (onboard):...78.
074:31:31 Duke (onboard): Okay, we got 150 on the PUGS, unbalanced, decrease.
074:31:34 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. Don says that if we watch it go, it'll go down to about - almost 200 and then work its way back up.
074:31:40 Duke (onboard): Okay.
074:31:43 Young (onboard): Okay. Three minutes. Right on time.
074:31:47 Mattingly (onboard): Man, that thing is - their prediction is right on this.
074:31:50 Young (onboard): Yeah.
074:31:51 Mattingly (onboard): Isn't that beautiful?
074:31:52 Duke (onboard): [Garble] heard of it.
074:31:53 Young (onboard): [Garble].
074:31:54 Duke (onboard): Okay, coming up on 03:30.
074:31:56 Young (onboard): EMS and the Delta-V to go are right together. Perfect.
074:31:59 Duke (onboard): Mark; 03:30.
074:32:02 Mattingly (onboard): Chamber pressure's at 98.
074:32:06 Duke (onboard): Stand by for the tight limits -
074:32:07 Duke (onboard): Mark. Tight limits. We're at 200; unbalanced; jiggling around a little bit; decrease.
074:32:20 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, [garble].
074:32:23 Duke (onboard): Coming up on 4 minutes. SPS pressures are rock solid.
074:32:29 Duke (onboard): Mark; 4 minutes.
074:32:31 Mattingly (onboard): Inside (laughter).
074:32:32 Duke (onboard): I'm not, I'm looking at the gages. I was having a little bias back there. Okay?
074:32:39 Young (onboard): Okay, and now for [garble].
074:32:40 Duke (onboard): Stand by for crossover.
074:32:43 Young (onboard): EMS and this thing are right together. Couldn't be any closer.
074:32:47 Duke (onboard): It looks like we've had crossover.
074:32:49 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. My chamber pressure very smoothly increased to 100.
074:32:53 Duke (onboard): Okay, and the unbalance went a back - that's jiggling around on zero. Stand by.
074:32:59 Duke (onboard): Mark; 04:30.
074:33:05 Mattingly (onboard): Man, that mental machine.
074:33:07 Young (onboard): Keep doing it, machine.

This is Apollo Control at 74 hours, 33 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The Lunar Orbit Insertion burn presumably still underway at this time having a six minute, 14 second duration, an ignition time of 74 hours, 28 minutes, 27 seconds. And if the burn is successful, completely normal, the spacecraft will come around the east rim of the Moon in 16 minutes, 30 seconds. That would be at a Ground Elapsed Time of 74 hours, 42 minutes, 8 seconds. However, if for some reason, the burn is not successful or we have no ignition on the Service Propulsion System engine, the spacecraft will reappear much sooner at about eight minutes from now, or at Ground Elapsed Time of 74 hours, 50 minutes, 5 seconds. To repeat again, the predicted S-IVB impact time [is] 75 hours, 07 [minutes], 03 [seconds]. One of the large television rear projection Eidophor machines does carry the seismometer trace from one of the earlier Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Packages, and the flight controllers here in the control room will be watching that with interest, as we approach the impact time. At 74:34 and returning at the no-burn AOS time in some seven minutes, this is Apollo Control.
074:33:24 Duke (onboard): Coming up on five minutes.
074:33:29 Duke (onboard): Mark; five minutes. Unbalance is 150, decrease. Looking great.
074:33:34 Young (onboard): [Garble] to go.
074:33:39 Duke (onboard): Helium's down to 1800. Nitrogen's looking great.
074:33:45 Mattingly (onboard): Man, that time is gonna be 06:14.
074:33:47 Young (onboard): Sure is.
074:33:51 Mattingly (onboard): Casper, you're gonna lose your bar [?].
074:33:54 Young (onboard): That's really spectacular.
074:33:56 Duke (onboard): Okay. Stand by, on 05:30.
074:33:59 Duke (onboard): Mark; 05:30.
074:34:05 Young (onboard): At shutdown, maybe we can get another light [garble].
074:34:09 Mattingly (onboard): Yep.
074:34:10 Duke (onboard): Okay. Rock solid. Thirty seconds.
074:34:16 Mattingly (onboard): Not gonna get there early. Got ten seconds overburn to worry about.
074:34:20 Duke (onboard): Yeah. 100, decrease, unbalance, looking super, 40 percent. Six minutes...
074:34:29 Duke (onboard): Mark.
074:34:31 Young (onboard): [Garble].
074:34:33 Duke (onboard): 06:05...
074:34:34 Duke (onboard): Mark. 06:10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15...
074:34:45 Young (onboard): Auto shutdown.
074:34:46 Duke (onboard): ...15.1...
Apollo 16 is now in Lunar orbit, starting Rev 1.
074:34:47 Young (onboard): Master Alarm.
074:34:48 Duke (onboard): RCS pressure.
074:34:49 Young (onboard): RCS pressure.
074:34:50 Duke (onboard): It's okay.
074:34:51 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. Two, three...
074:34:52 Duke (onboard): It went high on the...
074:34:53 Mattingly (onboard):...four. Okay. We've done our thing. We didn't get anything here. You want to...
074:34:57 Young (onboard): [Garble].
074:34:58 Mattingly (onboard):... copy those numbers? Two, 3, 28039.
074:35:01 Young (onboard): Yeah.
074:35:05 Duke (onboard): Okay. What, 28039?
074:35:07 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah, 28039.
074:35:10 Duke (onboard): They're okay.
074:35:11 Mattingly (onboard): Okay.
074:35:14 Young (onboard): Plus 0.2, minus one -minus zero, minus one. We got to look at 1620, right?
074:35:21 Duke (onboard): [Garble] 5-5.
074:35:22 Young (onboard): 1620.
074:35:23 Duke (onboard): You're not gonna trim.
074:35:24 Young (onboard): No, but...
074:35:25 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, get the - Delta-Vs now - I mean, Delta-V, 20.
074:35:28 Young (onboard): That just call a Noun 20?
074:35:30 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah, Verb 6.
074:35:34 Young (onboard): Okay. Enter. Okay, now let's - Roll's fine...
074:35:40 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble].
074:35:41 Young (onboard): ...[garble] 02. 35799.
074:35:42 Mattingly (onboard): Yes.
074:35:44 Young (onboard): Plus 26.8.
074:35:45 Mattingly (onboard): Yes.
074:35:46 Young (onboard): That's good. You get that?
074:35:47 Duke (onboard): Good, yeah. Let's go with the gimbal motors.
074:35:50 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. Wait a minute now. Let me see if we got everything here. Gimbal Motors, four, Off. Okay. Main B.
074:35:53 Duke (onboard): Go.

This is Apollo Control at 74 hours, 41 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Less than a minute away from the time at which the spacecraft should come around the corner of the Moon assuming we had not a successful Lunar Orbit Insertion burn. The acquisition time with the normal burn would be at 74 hours, 50 minutes, 5 seconds; some eight minutes and eight seconds away from this point. Mark.
No noise on the down link. Apparently the spacecraft did have a successful burn. To repeat the acquisition time with a successful burn; 74 hours, 50 minutes, 5 seconds. At 74:42 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.

This is Apollo Control; less than a minute away from Acquisition Of Signal from Apollo 16, and it appears at least from the timing, that we have indeed had a successful Lunar Orbit Insertion burn, which according to pre-burn planning, should produce an elliptical orbit around the Moon, with a pericynthion of 58.3 nautical miles [108 km], [and an] apocynthion of 170 nautical miles [315 km]. We'll stand by here for the first words from the crew and the burn report. Displays being changed here in the Control Center from the Earth-Moon transit display in the center scribing plotter to the Lunar Orbit plotter. Mark-Zero. Let's leave the line up now.
Have confirmed AOS.
074:51:10 Young: Hello, Houston. Sweet 16 has arrived.
074:51:14 Peterson: Roger, 16. Copy you loud and clear.
074:51:20 Duke: Okay, Pete. Super double fantastic burn. If you're ready, I'll give you a burn status report.
074:51:31 Peterson: Okay, go ahead, John.
Peterson hasn't realised that although John made the initial announcement, it is not Charlie who will present the burn report.
074:51:34 Duke: Okay, Delta-TIG was 0615 burn - 06:15.1 burn time, plus 2803.9, trim [garble]; residuals, plus 0.2, minus zero, minus 0.1. Delta-VC is minus 5.5; fuel, 376, Ox, 371; 150, unbalance, decrease. Okay, at ignition, we got a momentary SPS light; then it went out. During the burn, the Oxidizer pressure read 200. The Fuel side was a little bit low, and it was about 165 on my gauge. After shutdown, the Fuel side climbed to 170. The Oxidizer went to about 202 with an SPS light, and we've still got it. Over.
074:52:33 Peterson: Roger. We copied everything except the roll, pitch, and yaw, which was blacked out by some noise.
074:52:41 Duke: Okay, the trim attitude - we did not trim. The residuals were as we gave you after the burn. Our attitude was 005, 358, 002. Over.
074:52:53 Peterson: Roger. We copy. [Pause.]
074:53:01 Young: And it was a slight transient, when the second bank was lit, that I don't remember from previous burns. You might look at that data, but it was super.
074:53:13 Peterson: Rog. Copy.
074:53:14 Mattingly: And it appeared to me that the chamber pressure had dropped off just as we brought the second bank on. [Pause.]
074:53:25 Young: And as you can see, we're in 170.4 by 58.3 [nautical miles - 315.6 by 108 km] according to the old computer, and that baby just rifled it right down the line.
074:53:36 Peterson: All righty.
074:53:37 Young: And everybody is looking out their window. And right now, we're looking right down at Crater King, and it's just as fantastic as it always has been.
074:53:48 Peterson: Roger.
074:53:49 Young: You can see those little dark - those little dark - look like volcanic black spots up - up in the north sector of it, and you can see the central peaks with a - with a varied - very white central peaks covered by lighter gray - gray-brown material that sort of looked like somebody painted it on there with a - with a - with a paintbrush. [Long pause.]
074:54:39 Duke: And, Pete, your first view at Tsiolkovsky out of my window is pretty - it's a spectacular sight; the way that - looks like a marshmallow float - a central peak floating in the top of a hot chocolate.
074:54:55 Young: Yeah, you - it - it's like - three guys - they've each got a window, and we're staring at the - at the ground. It's really - Boy, this has got to be the neatest way to make a living anybody's ever invented.
Comm break.
074:56:20 Duke: Pete, 16 here. Another pretty sight we had before burn was the Earthset. It - really quite a view. [Pause.]
074:56:33 Peterson: We're all sitting here listening, Charlie. Tell us about it. [Long pause.]
074:57:14 Duke: Pete, you got - a - Mapping - or the Pan Camera Power's - is On?
074:57:21 Peterson: Okay, Pan Camera Power, On. [Long pause.]
074:58:00 Young: How'd the S-IVB look? [Pause.]
074:58:07 Peterson: It hadn't happened yet, John. It's about another - nine minutes or so. [Long pause.]
074:58:25 Young: I - I trust we're not getting there the same time it does.
074:58:29 Peterson: I trust.
074:58:33 Young: Okay.
Comm break.
074:59:41 Peterson: It - it's going to hit on the southwest corner of Reinhold, Ken.
074:59:46 Young: Say again, Pete.
074:59:47 Peterson: Tell Ken it's going to hit on the southwest corner of Reinhold. He should know where that is.
The S-IVB did impact the surface southwest of Reinhold, 45.6 km from the rim. The precise position of the resulting crater wasn't known until 2015 when it was located in imagery from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. A failure of the radio system within the Saturn's Instrument Unit meant that it could not be properly tracked all the way to the Moon.
Impact crater of the Apollo 16 S-IVB. Location is 1.921° north, 335.377° east, -1,104 metres elevation
074:59:55 Young: I'm sure he does.
074:59:58 Mattingly: Okay. Let me get the binoculars out here - playing with them there. It's pretty interesting. I tell you, all that time spent with Farouk sure is going to pay off, because it does look like old home.
Ken is referring to Farouk El-Baz, a geologist from Bellcomm who trained the later Command Module Pilots how to observe and interpret the landforms they would see from lunar orbit.
075:00:15 Peterson: That's good, Ken.
075:00:16 Mattingly: The lawn needs mowing and all that. [Pause.]
075:00:28 Peterson: Okay, Casper, Pan Camera Power, Off.

This is Apollo Control; 75 hours, 1 minute Ground Elapsed Time. Completely successful Lunar Orbit Insertion burn, with a duration of six minutes and 15 seconds. Reported on board measurements on the lunar orbit; 58.3 by 170.4 nautical miles [108.0 by 315.6 km]. We'll continue to monitor this first front-side pass and Lunar Orbit Number 1. At 75:02, this is Apollo Control.
075:03:21 Duke: Pete, looking out at the horizon, you can really tell you're in the highlands. The horizon is really jagged looking.
075:03:31 Peterson: Looks like coming up on the Rockies, huh?
075:03:34 Young: Of course, we're start - we're starting to come up over the flatlands now, over the Smyth Sea. I remember a landmarking track down there on Apollo 10. It's still there. You can't really tell by looking at it that the Smyth Sea is any - any deeper or lower than the data shows it is right in the surrounding terrain.

075:06:17 Young: The submerged craters in Smythii remind me a lot of a - coral atolls. They just got the ridges sticking up, you know, and the - and the bottoms of them appear to be flooded with the same material that's in Smyth. [Pause.]
075:06:40 Peterson: We're digging out a map now, 16, to take a look at it. [Long pause.]
075:07:42 Young: We're going to get a close-in picture of Humboldt here, as we come up, because we'll probably miss it on the next round.
075:07:49 Peterson: Roger. [Long pause.]
075:08:04 Young: That's real - it's really a fascinating crater, the way the dark mare has got in - sort of like a path around the edges, and - and there's a fracture pattern running across it, and it has some very prominent central peaks that are very white. But it has every contrast and color on the Moon.
075:08:31 Peterson: Roger. [Pause.]
075:08:38 Young: Boy, those fracture patterns running down through it are white - appear to be white, layered fracture patterns. They look like somebody's drawn them on there with a piece of chalk. [Long pause.]
075:09:38 Peterson: S-IVB has impacted. [Pause.]

075:13:44 Young: Some of those central domes are exceptionally dark, and they have exceptionally dark material running down a white surface. You can see that.

075:16:03 Mattingly: With the binoculars, we passed over Langrenus, and you can see blocks on the tops of the central peak, and some features that probably are there that I just haven't noticed before in that central feature. You can see an awful lot of - looks like a - the demarcation where the central feature - looks like a crack in it - has a whole ring of craters that kind of dots that boundary. And then, you see some more of those little craters up along near the top of the central lineament also. And you just don't see those kind of things stand out at you without the binoculars.
075:16:40 Peterson: Roger.
075:16:44 Mattingly: I could also say that the binoculars at ten power is the maximum you can hold in your hand. You got to get yourself set up very nicely for it before you start.

This is Apollo Control at 75 hours, 18 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Crew of Apollo 16 still three tourists in their first lunar orbit observing the features of the Moon, calling out various craters as they pass over them. [The] S-IVB impacted the lunar surface at about 75:09. Signals are still coming to the ALSEP, coming out on the recording graph of the normal lunar seismic activity made rather straight line up until the time of impact and the strokes of the recorder are broadening continuously as the seismic waves travel through the Moon to the ALSEP site. Some 55 minutes until Loss of Signal remaining in this first lunar orbit. That's 75:19, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 75:20. Apollo 16 Commander John Young becomes the first human to go into lunar orbit twice, having flown on Apollo 10 which is a precursor to the landing missions. [The] Apollo 10 mission descended to within about eight miles of the lunar surface and the, that is the Lunar Module did. Jim Lovell has been to the Moon twice, but the second trip, the first having been Apollo 8 the first manned lunar orbit mission. The second being in Apollo 13, which was an aborted mission and coasted past the Moon and, therefore, Lovell did not go into lunar orbit on his second trip. At 75:21, this is Apollo Control.

075:27:46 Mattingly (onboard): You should be able to. Be right at the terminator.
075:27:51 Young (onboard): Right at the terminator, huh?
075:27:52 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah.
075:27:53 Young (onboard): Trouble with the terminator, this Moon is so ragged, I can't - do it even. I'll get a decent terminator shot.
075:28:05 Mattingly (onboard): I'll take care of all that. Okay, there's Taylor, Taylor A [garble] Zöllner - then we have to have [garble] Descartes. That is Descartes, right there. See the - [garble]?

075:28:28 Mattingly: In this lighting, you can see the Crater Descartes, and it stands out much bigger than you would expect, because of the low Sun angle. And - in fact I had to look into my map in order to make sure that was what I was looking at. And the material that runs out of it - that - that's in the area, are the things we talk about as being that bright reflective area, in this low Sun angle, has a much blockier and jumbled appearance than it does on any of the high-Sun photographs.
075:29:21 Peterson: Roger.
075:29:22 Mattingly: It looks very much like looking down on a clinkery - a big clinkery cinder field, but on a much larger scale.
075:29:30 Peterson: Roger. Copy.
075:29:32 Young: Yeah, a big - a rounded surface of clinkers. It's fantastic. Boy, is that rough! [Long pause.]
075:30:15 Duke: Okay, Houston, as we look to the west and to past the terminator, there's - a couple of degrees past the terminator, there's one bright spot, a peak standing up which is west of [pause] well, west of Kant. [Pause.]
075:30:39 Peterson: Charlie, you're fading out.
075:30:40 Duke: Really high ground. Say again.
075:30:47 Peterson: Right after you started talking about this peak and you said something like "west of," you faded out. [Long pause.]
075:31:06 Peterson: Go ahead, Charlie. [Long pause.]
075:31:45 Young: Yeah, the general opinion here is that we may be looking at part of Smoky Mountain sticking up through some - through the shadows.
075:31:53 Peterson: [Garble]. [Long pause.]
075:32:25 Peterson: Houston, 16, FAO advises you've got some extra film on Magazine UU - that's VHBW, and you can use it for targets of opportunity, and you can use the CEX exposure graph and stop down one stop from what you get off the graph. [Pause.]
075:32:50 Young: Okay, I hear you. [Long pause.]
075:33:33 Peterson: And, Casper, on that last transmission - As an example, f/11 for the CEX, you should go to f/16 to use with Magazine UU.

This is Apollo Control, at 75:39 Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16 approaching the lunar terminator or sundown; in about four minutes. At the present time, the crew is conducting a Program 52 realignment of the Inertial Measuring Unit - Inertial Measurement Unit in the guidance system. To repeat again, the change of shift press briefing with Flight Director Gerry Griffin will be about 4 o'clock Central Time at the Houston News Center Briefing Room. At 75:39, this Apollo Control.
075:40:21 Mattingly: Hey, Don, we're trying to set up the - the camera for the next terminator and sunrise, and I thought I understood what you told me about the settings, but I guess I don't. Can you run through that again? I guess I just as soon have you just give me the proper settings.
075:40:38 Peterson: You're talking about this Magazine UU that I just called up?
075:40:44 Mattingly: Yes, sir; the VHBW.
075:40:47 Peterson: Roger; stand by. [Long pause.]
075:41:06 Peterson: Ken, they - they're get - looking that up for us right now. And in the meantime, I'll try to give you the rule again. Maybe that'll clear it up some. You can use that CEX exposure graph that you have on board, and take the readings off of that.
075:41:21 Mattingly: Rog.
075:41:22 Peterson: And then simply increase the stop number one stop. For example, if the CEX exposure graph calls for f/11 and you're gonna use the Magazine UU, you should go to f/16.
075:41:41 Mattingly: Yeah, okay. I - I thought - I - You used an example; I thought you meant that specifically, and I couldn't make that correlate. Okay. And Charlie says this magazine is HBW instead of VHBW.
075:41:55 Peterson: That's affirmative; he's right. [Long pause.]
075:42:09 Peterson: And, Casper, for the terminator photography on the next rev, we're recommending you go ahead and use Magazine SS. That's Sierra Sierra. [Pause.]
075:42:23 Mattingly: Okay; use the one we had planned on.
075:42:26 Peterson: That's affirmative.
075:42:30 Mattingly: Okay, thank you. [Long pause.]
075:42:50 Peterson: And, Casper, that call on Magazine UU; we meant to impart to you that you can use that for targets of opportunity.

Like we looked at - at Antares - and you just couldn't see the Scorpion at all. And that may be due to the extreme amount of Earthshine that's being reflected off of the LM. That LM is like looking at it almost in daylight, and, good gosh, the - the Moon looks like you can see everything on there just like - it's really bright.

076:26:59 Young (onboard): What he said was, "I'd like to get a picture of Crookes." He said, "There's a possibility that you guys may be able to pick it up, depending on whose window you're sitting in at the time. I know Ken looks at it, but I don't know if you do or not; but if you happen to be sitting there and it comes around, why don't you get a picture of it?" That's what he said.

076:29:00 Young (onboard): You want to get over here, Ken?
076:29:01 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble].
076:29:02 Duke (onboard): It's out of this window. Crookes's supposed to be.
076:29:06 Mattingly (onboard): It should be out - out of here or there, either one. This seems to be fine.

We'll be reacquiring Apollo 16 in about 30 minutes. At the present time, Flight Director Pete Frank is reviewing the mission status with each of his flight controllers. Our spacecraft communicator at this time is astronaut Hank Hartsfield. And our tracking data shows Apollo 16 to to be in an orbit with an apolune of 169.9 nautical miles [314.6 km], a perilune of 58.1 [nautical miles, 107.6 km]. At 76 hours, 29 minutes; this is Apollo Control.
076:29:21 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble] I have one at [garble].
076:29:29 Young (onboard): Okay, we got our fuel cell purge now?
076:29:31 Duke (onboard): No. I'm gonna start it right now.
076:29:34 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. Let's see, get - get the - Suppose we could use Magazine SS? That other one.
076:29:42 Duke (onboard): That one's the magazine you want to use for this?
076:29:45 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah.
076:30:02 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, and this is gonna be [garble] seven [garble] six [garble]. Okay [garble] SPS pressure.
076:30:24 Duke (onboard): Going up, you mean?
076:30:25 Mattingly (onboard): I put it to acknowledge [?] because it was on continuously. Must be [garble]. It looks like it's gonna go higher. It's about 210 now.
076:30:36 Duke (onboard): Well - Yeah, if the light was on, though, it should come back on again.
076:30:39 Mattingly (onboard): It may have gone off from being cooled down.
076:30:41 Duke (onboard): Yeah. Okay. Probably.
076:30:44 Young (onboard): Take a look in there. The condenser's normal [garble].
076:31:00 Duke (onboard): Starting to open the purge [garble]. Maybe we better turn off the waste water dump.
076:31:05 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, I'll get it. What's that?
076:31:11 Duke (onboard): Fuel Cell 1. Okay.
076:31:15 Mattingly (onboard): Have you already done the...
076:31:17 Duke (onboard): It's did with the purge.
076:31:18 Mattingly (onboard): Oh. All right. Okay. Okay. This is off.
076:31:23 Duke (onboard): Okay, right at ten.
076:31:43 Duke (onboard): Man, we are streaming out a lot of particles with us. Okay, this terminator's coming up, Ken.
076:31:51 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. I'm coming. Well, we're not gonna be directly over it until about 34, which is two and a half minutes.
076:32:17 Duke (onboard): You wouldn't believe all the particles we've got.
076:32:20 Mattingly (onboard): Look at that one. Real pretty.
076:32:31 Duke (onboard): I'm gonna let you get the [garble] I'll get the [garble]
076:32:40 Mattingly (onboard): Well, it's not clear to me we're gonna get anything here.
076:32:45 Duke (onboard): That's really spectacular. Oh, this is beautiful! Contrast.
076:33:08 Duke (onboard): H2 purge, Master Alarm.
076:33:10 Young (onboard): [Garble] that one.
076:33:19 Duke (onboard): See it coming, Ken?
076:33:21 Mattingly (onboard): Get these. I'm not sure it's - Harry [?] wants pictures of stuff like that [garble]. Get one here of this - these guys right here in the bottom of this thing. That should be [garble].
076:33:43 Duke (onboard): Look at the depth of that crater!
076:33:46 Duke (onboard): Except for the full Sun, it makes it look very - very...
076:33:49 Young (onboard): A lot deeper than it is.
076:33:59 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble] picture.
076:34:01 Duke (onboard): [Garble] on?
076:34:03 Mattingly (onboard): No. Thank you.
076:34:09 Young (onboard): Here's where they turn into hills.
076:34:15 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble] take a couple of pictures here [garble]. Excuse me.
076:34:26 Duke (onboard): Sure.
076:34:42 Young (onboard): There's that central peak in Icarus.
076:34:48 Mattingly (onboard): Have you got Icarus?
076:34:50 Young (onboard): Right out there on the right. You didn't see that, Charlie.
076:34:54 Duke (onboard): Oh yeah, I see it, It's taller than a - There it is. Right there. See it?
076:35:01 Young (onboard): It isn't really taller,
076:35:04 Duke (onboard): Right out here. Right on - almost on [garble] horizon.
076:35:07 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah.
076:35:31 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, Charlie [garble].
076:35:47 Young (onboard): Why does it look rounder coming around this way than it does when you go into the terminator; it looks straight on the other side.
076:35:54 Mattingly (onboard): There's some suspicion that there's a different material.
076:35:58 Young (onboard): All right. Just wanted to ask [garble]. Did I say the middle of Icarus looks like a big [garble] volcano? Couldn't.
076:36:28 Mattingly (onboard): What did you call it? Icarus?
076:36:30 Young (onboard): Yeah.
076:36:53 Duke (onboard): H2 purge, Master Alarm [garble].
076:37:09 Mattingly (onboard): Let's see, we're about 37:06 and there's -
076:37:34 Duke (onboard): What's a flashing 37 doing there?
076:37:38 Young (onboard): Ken will figure it out for you.
076:38:11 Young (onboard): [Garble] out there.
076:38:29 Young (onboard): Looking at the Moon hurts my head. I won't look at it. There's too much down there I don't understand.
076:38:45 Young (onboard): Charlie, just keep [garble] on the book.
076:38:48 Duke (onboard): That's why I'm purging the fuel cell.
076:38:50 Young (onboard): Oh.
076:39:02 Duke (onboard): I tell you, when we get down to eight miles, we're gonna really look like we're down among them.
076:39:08 Young (onboard): Sure are.
076:39:16 Duke (onboard): What PTC [garble], Ken?
076:39:20 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah [garble].
076:39:39 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. Get back here, Charlie.
Beginning Lunar Rev 2 at 076:40.
076:40:32 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. I guess I can turn that purge - that waste water dump off.
076:40:38 Young (onboard): Stuff is coming out, Ken.
076:40:40 Mattingly (onboard): It is?
076:40:41 Young (onboard): Yeah.
076:40:42 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. Our waste off.
076:40:57 Duke (onboard): [Garble].
076:41:20 Mattingly (onboard): Okay; we get the AOS at -
076:41:27 Young (onboard): It really fires thrusters [garble].
076:41:33 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble] firing thrusters.
076:41:36 Young (onboard): Uh-huh.
076:41:37 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah. What do you - what made the comment that you said was really firing one of the thrusters?
076:41:43 Young (onboard): [Garble].
076:41:44 Mattingly (onboard): Oh.
076:42:18 Duke (onboard): [Garble].
076:42:40 Young (onboard): [Garble]?
076:42:41 Duke (onboard): Yeah.
076:42:42 Young (onboard): Well, I don't know. I don't know.
076:42:55 Young (onboard): [Garble].
076:43:03 Mattingly (onboard): They all look different to me when I go hanging upside down.
076:43:06 Duke (onboard): [Garble].
076:43:07 Mattingly (onboard): I know they're not supposed to, but they sure do.
076:43:08 Duke (onboard): Sure do [garble].
076:43:13 Mattingly (onboard): Look at those little tracks down there running in between these two craters.
076:43:52 Duke (onboard): [Garble] big blocks [garble].
076:43:59 Young (onboard): Seen with the naked eye from 60 miles, they've got to be big [garble].
076:44:03 Duke (onboard): They're really big.
076:44:05 Mattingly (onboard): Which one are you looking at?
076:44:06 Duke (onboard): [Garble].
076:44:07 Mattingly (onboard): Oh.
076:44:10 Duke (onboard): And it has a ray [garble].
076:44:13 Young (onboard): I have to agree that the back side is rather monotonous looking, although I'm sure each one of these craters tells us something, if you're smart enough to know what's going on.
076:44:24 Mattingly (onboard): Wish I could clean this window.
076:44:26 Young (onboard): Isn't that terrible? Wonder how that happened?
076:44:30 Mattingly (onboard): I don't know. It's on the outer pane.
076:44:32 Young (onboard): Yeah. Inside of the outer pane.
076:44:35 Mattingly (onboard): Yep. It really makes a difference with the binocs.
076:44:39 Young (onboard): Yeah.
076:44:45 Mattingly (onboard): Man, those are huge features.
076:45:02 Young (onboard): What gets me is the ridge - is the - is the ridge line rou - around [garble] Man, there is just not a flat place anywheres. Do we go over Gagarin?
076:45:16 Mattingly (onboard): No.
076:45:17 Young (onboard): I didn't think so. We're coming up on something like Mendeleev now? Probably?
076:45:25 Mattingly (onboard): Uh -
076:45:28 Young (onboard): That big flat thing right there.
076:45:30 Mattingly (onboard): Looks about right.
076:45:41 Young (onboard): You want to get a picture of the Sea of Moscow? Anybody gotten any good pictures of it?
076:45:47 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble] we have enough Sim.
076:46:31 Mattingly (onboard): AOS? Maybe we should turn this thing off before AOS.
076:46:38 Duke (onboard): The dump?
076:46:39 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah [garble]....
076:46:40 Duke (onboard): Am I looking up north for that?
076:46:43 Young (onboard): You're looking up north. Yeah, you're looking north.
076:46:48 Mattingly (onboard): Is there still stuff coming out of our dump?
076:46:50 Young (onboard): No. It's about to stop.
076:46:52 Mattingly (onboard): Okay.
076:47:20 Young (onboard): Want me to get a picture of it on the right?
076:47:22 Mattingly (onboard): Sure.
076:47:23 Young (onboard): It really makes a - Give - give me a thing.
076:47:25 Duke (onboard): [Garble].
076:47:27 Mattingly (onboard): Okay.
076:47:28 Young (onboard): What should I take it at?
076:47:30 Mattingly (onboard): I don't know, John, I'll have to go and see, here.
076:47:33 Young (onboard): This can't use 250 at f/11?
076:47:35 Mattingly (onboard): I'd better dump it.
076:47:38 Young (onboard): Okay.
076:47:40 Mattingly (onboard): I ain't sure that's the right thing, but I know it ...
076:47:44 Young (onboard): This is probably about right for right in here.
076:47:47 Mattingly (onboard): Where did my little wheel go?
076:47:51 Duke (onboard): Here's one right here, Ken.
076:47:52 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble] Thank you. Well [laughter]...
076:47:56 Young (onboard): Will a 250-millimeter lens get it?
076:47:58 Mattingly (onboard): John, I don't - I can't see through you, I don't know. But I would think that on the horizon you get most anything because...
076:48:05 Young (onboard): Yeah, but that's a long ways out.
076:48:06 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble].
076:48:13 Young (onboard): No, I'll do it [garble].
076:48:16 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble] Ten-year medals for free.
076:48:25 Young (onboard): [Garble] tracking that out [garble].
076:48:26 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble] Right?
076:48:33 Duke (onboard): This is the most unique crater I've ever seen; the one right here with the black rim. It's all white except for the rim. See that bright crater.
076:48:42 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah, yeah. That's - that big crater is Chaplygin and the...
076:48:45 Young (onboard): Okay. That was the Sea of Moscow. Excuse me.
076:48:49 Mattingly (onboard): Okay.
076:48:50 Young (onboard): Whatever that means.
076:48:52 Duke (onboard): Take any good pictures yet?
076:48:53 Mattingly (onboard): Yes [garble].
076:48:56 Young (onboard): [Garble] handle it [garble] Soviets [garble] eat their heart out [garble].
076:49:04 Mattingly (onboard): If they come, I bet they don't quit.
076:49:09 Young (onboard): [Garble]...
076:49:11 Mattingly (onboard): You - you...
076:49:12 Young (onboard): ...[garble].
076:49:18 Duke (onboard): You know, this Window 5 is a little foggy on the outer pane, too.
076:49:21 Young (onboard): Yeah.
076:49:22 Duke (onboard): Just a little.
076:49:32 Mattingly (onboard): What frame number was that?
076:49:36 Young (onboard): That frame number was number 4 [garble]. Number 4.
076:49:50 Duke (onboard): Now, we're gonna be able to see earthrise right now.
076:49:59 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble].
076:50:00 Duke (onboard): You want to get a picture of earthrise?
076:50:03 Young (onboard): Well, probably not. There's probably only been ten million pictures already took of it. But if you're looking for PR, like the Sea of Moscow or some other thing [garble].
076:50:19 Mattingly (onboard): What'd you take it at, 1/250, f/11 - f/87 John?
076:50:25 Young (onboard): I put it 1/250 at f/11. f/8 was probably a better choice.
076:51:04 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, [garble] Let me get it set.
076:51:08 Duke (onboard): [Garble].
076:51:09 Young (onboard): Yeah, Pitch, 10, and Yaw, 355. We pick them up on Omni C, and then we'll shift over.
076:51:14 Duke (onboard): Yeah, we can do that.
076:51:32 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. And in a few minutes, we're gonna do our systems checks. Huh?
076:51:38 Duke (onboard): [Garble].
076:51:39 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah. Okay, we're gonna do our systems checks for DOI. Another one of these things we can get started early.
076:51:57 Mattingly (onboard): Dang it [garble]. window screwed up like that? It's really [garble].
076:52:05 Duke (onboard): I can't believe it.
076:52:08 Young (onboard): What's that, Charlie?
076:52:09 Duke (onboard): That that's the fu - (laughter) - tape recorder - that that's the Moon down there.
076:52:17 Young (onboard): It's the whole thing.
076:52:19 Duke (onboard): The whole thing. I thought we'd see Tsiolkovsky this rev. Oh, yeah.
076:52:31 Mattingly (onboard): It comes again.
076:52:32 Duke (onboard): That right? Oh, yeah.
076:52:36 Young (onboard): Yeah, I imagine when the Soviets start up here, they'll set up their lunar base in the first place; stay for a while.
076:52:46 Mattingly (onboard): Now that's really frustrating.
076:52:48 Duke (onboard): I can't understand what [garble] doing out over that way.
076:52:51 Young (onboard): Man, there sure is a lot of things up here that I don't understand. Look at that big crater down south with the rocks in it. Or - you - you're looking right at it. It's got layers of walls there.
076:53:05 Mattingly (onboard): Which direction? That bright one there?
076:53:06 Young (onboard): Yeah, the bright one. With the lay - it's got layers of walls in it. I don't know what the name of that one is. It looks like - you get a little higher Sun angle, it looks like anthracite coal laid in against chalk. It doesn't look that way right now.
076:53:21 Duke (onboard): It's really a unique crater chain down there. Really - [garble] south of track,
076:53:29 Young (onboard): [Garble].
076:53:36 Mattingly (onboard): Okay, is that -
076:53:37 Young (onboard): Yeah, that's [garble] right there.
076:53:46 Mattingly (onboard): Well, that's not - those crater chains there. Let's see, we just passed [garble] probably?
076:53:56 Young (onboard): I just can't get it.
076:53:58 Mattingly (onboard): Try it again. You got King? Isn't that King back there?
076:54:05 Duke (onboard): [Garble]?
076:54:06 Young (onboard): Right out to the left.
076:54:08 Duke (onboard): I don't see it. It may be in your window.
076:54:09 Young (onboard): Yeah.
076:54:23 Mattingly (onboard): Way out there.
076:54:24 Young (onboard): Where?
076:54:25 Mattingly (onboard): Way out there, yeah.
076:54:26 Young (onboard): Okay, I'm looking - right there.
076:54:30 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah. I can see it.
076:54:33 Duke (onboard): .., What do you think about King?
076:54:37 Duke (onboard): See, it's got kind of funny little things in it...
076:54:39 Duke (onboard): (Sneeze)
076:54:40 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble].. that - things that look like lava flows -
076:54:43 Duke (onboard): (Sneeze).
076:54:45 Young (onboard): But they've got to be lava flows running down the side of that mountain there...
076:54:47 Duke (onboard): (Sneeze)
076:54:48 Young (onboard):... whatever made that crater.
076:54:50 Mattingly (onboard): It's pretty big.
076:54:51 Duke (onboard): Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's got to be lava flows.
076:54:54 Mattingly (onboard): Okay. These crater chains running down here should lead down to Tsiolkovsky.
076:55:02 Young (onboard): Yeah [garble].
076:55:05 Duke (onboard): They do! Aha! There it is! [garble].
076:55:11 Young (onboard): Okay, there's [garble].
076:55:14 Mattingly (onboard): Oh, hey, that is pretty...
076:55:15 Duke (onboard): Isn't that something? [garble]...
076:55:16 Mattingly (onboard): Isn't that a beauty?
076:55:17 Young (onboard): Yeah, dang.
076:55:18 Mattingly (onboard): That - that must be one of the more spectacular things that [garble] here.
076:55:22 Young (onboard): Oh, you bet.
076:55:26 Mattingly (onboard): Well, I'd cancel the earthrise here.
076:55:28 Young (onboard): Okay. Okay.
076:55:31 Mattingly (onboard): What a treat. And so many things, I can't get. I'm like a little kid with ice cream; I don't know where to start.
076:55:37 Young (onboard): Right.
076:55:41 Duke (onboard): Oh, these windows are just really frosting.
076:55:45 Young (onboard): Should be AOSing here pretty quick.
076:55:47 Duke (onboard): Yeah.
076:55:48 Young (onboard): Shouldn't we, Charlie?
076:55:50 Mattingly (onboard): Not until we get earthrise.
076:55:54 Young (onboard): [Garble] what I mean. We were talking to them about King the last time we came across here.
076:56:01 Mattingly (onboard): We should get AOS at King. Now is that Thesaur [?]?
A search of Lunar atlases cannot locate a feature called Thesaur. However, the track of Apollo 16 puts it to the north of Pasteur at this time. It seems likely that this is a mis-transcription. The following references to Thesaur have been amended to Pasteur.
076:56:03 Young (onboard): No, that's not Pasteur. There's Pasteur. Pasteur's right here.
076:56:09 Duke (onboard): Ken, is it that little bright one right down there south of King?
076:56:11 Mattingly (onboard): That's what I was just wondering, but I think that Pasteur is supposed to be bigger than that.
076:56:17 Young (onboard): [Garble] could be [garble] the rays probably coming out of the King.
076:56:20 Duke (onboard): Yeah.
076:56:21 Young (onboard): It looks like it goes in the same sort of a [garble.] See those bright things on the bottom of it?
076:56:25 Duke (onboard): Yeah [garble].
076:56:38 Young (onboard): [Garble] know what this [garble] and how all this happened.
076:56:43 Mattingly (onboard): Look at this - I never noticed this before. We got a crater chain. It goes from here, right straight to the horizon.
076:56:48 Duke (onboard): Yeah. Right along the track.
076:56:50 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah? I never noticed that.
076:56:54 Young (onboard): Well, you ain't been here but a few hours.
076:56:57 Crew (onboard): (Laughter)
076:56:59 Young (onboard): Right straight to the horizon?
076:57:00 Mattingly (onboard): Yeah. There's a - it starts down here.
076:57:02 Duke (onboard): South of Pasteur.
076:57:04 Mattingly (onboard): And these two - see these two craters?
076:57:05 Young (onboard): Yeah.
076:57:06 Mattingly (onboard): It's almost right in the center of this window. Starts - And these two craters are together.
076:57:10 Young (onboard): Yeah.
076:57:11 Mattingly (onboard): And then it cuts down here and it goes towards the horizon and stops at the mare.
076:57:22 Duke (onboard): Better get ready to [garble].
076:57:25 Crew (onboard): (Cough)

This is Apollo Control at 76 hours, 57 minutes. We're now less than one minute from the scheduled time of reacquiring Apollo 16. The spacecraft now in its second revolution of the Moon and toward the end of this revolution the crew will be performing the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver. The Flight Dynamics Officer here in the Control Center is presently working up the final set of numbers for that burn. They will be performed with the spacecraft Service Propulsion System engine at approximately 78 hours, 35 minutes. This will be a 24.1-second burn and will be targeted to place the spacecraft in an orbit of about 59 by 11 nautical miles [109 by 20 km]. We expect we'll have the final numbers for that maneuver in about 15 minutes. At the present time we show Apollo 16 in an orbit of approximately 170 by 58 nautical miles [315 by 107 km] and we've just had the call, Acquisition of Signal, so we'll stand by for a call to the crew.
076:57:43 Duke (onboard): While we were - while we were [garble] I guess the weight was 25 pounds, ten percent.
076:57:58 Mattingly (onboard): Man, it's frustrating when one of these things pops those things in and out. Wonder what it is that makes it do this; it doesn't do it when you look at it. It only does it when you hit the binoculars. One other picture.
076:58:09 Duke (onboard): Waste water dump still open?
076:58:11 Young (onboard): No. Better not be [garble] now.
076:58:16 Mattingly (onboard): No, I don't think the waste water dump [garble] particles?
076:58:20 Duke (onboard): There it comes; there it comes, you guys!
076:58:23 Young (onboard): Oh, looky at that.
076:58:24 Duke (onboard): Isn't that spectacular?
076:58:26 Young (onboard): Man, instant earthrise!

076:59:32 Young: This is really some place.
076:59:36 Mattingly: We had a chance to watch you get AOS that time. [Pause.] I know we got lots of pictures of it, but you're going to have to look at one more. [Long pause.]
076:59:58 Mattingly (onboard): That is - man, that is...
077:00:00 Duke (onboard): Isn't that beautiful?
077:00:02 Mattingly (onboard): But you know, some of those photographs around the office that people say are - are no good, that looks the same color to me.
077:00:09 Duke (onboard): Yeah. I don't think that photo fidelity's true.
077:00:20 Mattingly (onboard): Man (laughter) -
077:00:21 Duke (onboard): [Garble] how long before we get to [garble].
077:00:24 Mattingly (onboard): About - ten minutes.

077:00:29 Mattingly (onboard): [Garble] Yeah.
077:00:30 Hartsfield: 16, Houston. Were you trying to transmit? We heard a little noise on the loop there and looks like our data was dropping in and out; looks good now. [Pause.]
077:00:40 Mattingly: Negative. We weren't trying to say anything, Hank.
077:00:40 Mattingly (onboard): He probably didn't get our initial call.
077:00:45 Hartsfield: Okay. [Pause.]
077:00:56 Duke: We just can't find any words. Everybody's peeking out the window here.
077:01:00 Hartsfield: Rog.

Those enthusiastic descriptions of the lunar surface have come from all three crewmen. Most recently we heard from John Young and Charlie Duke. The noise on the communication circuit at the present time is due to the fact that we are using one of the omni antennas aboard the spacecraft for communications. The crew will be switching over to the High Gain Antenna soon and that should quiet things down quite a bit.

077:11:54 Duke: Hank - I'm sure they have been described before, but the most - to me, the most unique craters up here - are two that we're just going over now - that - her ejecta blanket is completely white with white interior, but with a black rim to them.
077:12:46 Mattingly (onboard): Right down in there.
077:12:47 Duke (onboard): You know, that SPS comes on a lot...

077:18:17 Duke: Houston, 16.
077:18:20 Hartsfield: Go ahead.
077:18:24 Duke: Hey, Hank, how do the SPS data look?
077:18:28 Hartsfield: Okay, we were just talking about that, Charlie. Apparently, we had a real nominal burn. Our data down here showed a burn time of six minutes, 14.2 seconds, which is right on the money. And I got a few words on that PC drop. I understand that's completely normal for the first dual-bank burn, due to some helium bubbles that are normally trapped between the ball valves. So that wasn't unexpected for the first dual-bank burn - you shouldn't see it again. And as far as the SPS pressure light that came on, we warned you earlier to expect that, due to the pressure surge of the tanks pressurizing, we - you were right on the 200-psi limit - that triggered it. The second pressure light you got, which is apparently still on, is due to heat soak back into the tank. So it's not unexpected either.
077:19:20 Duke: Okay, fine. We passed that word on to you about the light. Not that we weren't expecting it, but just to tell you what had happened.
077:19:28 Hartsfield: Okay. [Long pause.]

077:21:17 Young: That crater Icarus [that] we got the profile picture of, it's a big round crater and it has real steep walls, and the central peak is a - is a - the central peak is a little above the - the crater walls, and you'll see that profile when you get the picture back. But the shape of the central peak is such that the only Earth analog I've ever seen that looked like it was sort of a shield volcano. I never saw anything like that in the - Now, I'm not saying the whole thing is not an impact, but that central peak is really unusual.
077:21:58 Hartsfield: Roger. We copy, and we're also through with the Pan Camera - you can go Power Off on that.
Comm break.
077:23:25 Young: Houston, apparently this line of secondaries down here that cross the mare - gives you the impression that there have been a couple of great big chickens been walking across there.
077:23:37 Hartsfield: Roger.
077:23:40 Young: That - that was courtesy of Charlie Duke, our airborne geologist and chicken farmer. [Pause.]
077:23:52 Hartsfield: Roger. Maybe you better watch your step.
077:23:58 Young: I'm watching.
Long comm break.
Those last two picturesque descriptions first of the crater Icarus with it's unusual central peak and second of the chicken tracks were from John Young.
It is quite common to see markings on the lunar landscape produced by ejecta being cast across the surface after a major impact. When this debris hit the surface, it often formed distinctive patterns that have a resemblance to the tracks made by birds across sand or fine silt.

077:31:45 Mattingly: Hank, you can tell Farouk that - those smooth areas we thought we saw around Isidorus and Capella are indeed uniquely different in texture. They are quite smooth. We'll get a chance to play with them later.
077:32:04 Hartsfield: Hey, that sounds real interesting, Ken. [Long pause.]
077:32:21 Hartsfield: How are your systems checks coming? [Pause.]

Ken Mattingly's reference on that last observation was to Farouk El-Baz, one of the geologists who has worked very closely with the crew and particularly with Mattingly in training him for the orbital photography and recognition of geologic landmarks on the Moon.
077:34:03 Mattingly: Henry, the amount of terminator movement in one rev is kind of dramatic up here. Last time around, Descartes just barely showed as a crater - but showed very dramatically - and now it's - as it moves out, it's starting to lose some of the starkness, and I'll get a picture of this bright zone. And it sure looks right now like the material that is just to the north of the crater Descartes and that stuff we talked about going between Delambre B and Descartes A are in fact extensions of the things that go into the Smoky and Stone Mountains. They - right now - look like they have a very similar texture.

This is Apollo Control at 77 hours, 54 minutes. During the last few minutes, among the sets of numbers passed up to the crew by CapCom Hank Hartsfield, were those they will use in performing the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver, and that burn is to occur at 78 hours; 33 minutes; 44 seconds. The maneuver will be performed using the spacecraft Service Propulsion System engine. It will be a - primarily a retrograde burn resulting in slowing the spacecraft by about 203.8 feet per second [62.1 m/s] or about 136 miles an hour [219 km/h]. And as a result of that, we expect the orbit to be changed to a 58.5 by 10.3 nautical miles [108.3 by 19.1 km]. This is the orbit from which the spacecraft will begin the Powered Descent to the lunar surface on the 13th revolution.

This is Apollo Control at 78 hours, 2 minutes. At the present time the Apollo 16 crew is in the process of putting the spacecraft in its proper attitude for the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver. That burn is to be performed in 31 minutes, 30 seconds with the spacecraft out of radio contact on the backside of the Moon. We have about 21 minutes remaining before we lose radio contact and in that amount of time we'll be monitoring spacecraft systems, Flight Dynamics Officer will be taking a last look at all of the numbers passed up to the crew to assure that the burn is the precise maneuver that we want to perform. Based on the numbers provided and which are entered in the computer on board, that burn will be 24.2 seconds in duration and is targeted to give us an orbit of 58.5 by 10.3 nautical miles [108.3 by 19.1 km]. The current orbit is 169.9 by 58.1 [314.6 by 107.6 km].

This is Apollo Control, we're coming up now on nine minutes until loss of contact with Apollo 16. About 19½ minutes away from the time the crew will be performing the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver. This maneuver, of course, performed behind the Moon. We'll be out of radio contact and we'll get our first look at the results of that maneuver when they come back around on the other side of the Moon on their third revolution. This burn is a very critical maneuver which must be performed with very preci - within very precise limits and particularly in the shutdown which the computer will signal. An overburn of slightly more than one second would place the spacecraft on a trajectory which would impact the Moon if it were not corrected. The normal procedure that the crew would follow in the event that they do get an overburn is to take out the overburn by using the Reaction Control System thrusters. We'll get about ten minutes of tracking as they come around the front side of the Moon on the third revolution and based on this information, we'll give them a Go/No-Go to stay in the trajectory resulting from the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver. If we don't like the looks of the trajectory based on ground tracking, they'll be told to perform the bailout burn. And that maneuver is scheduled at 79 hours, 22 minutes, 8 seconds in the Flight Plan if it is required and would place the spacecraft in a safe 62 by - 62.6- by 5.3-nautical-mile orbit. Again this is a contingency procedure only, and would be used only if, for some reason, the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver was not as planned and the spacecraft was determined to be in an unsafe orbit. The Guidance Officer has just reported that the crew has switched to Program 40, the program that they'll use prior to performing the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver. And everything continues to progress very smoothly.
