Apollo 16 - Flight Plan
The Flight Plan provides the crew and Mission Control with a quick reference to the planned events during the flight, and a miscelleny of other information that may be needed. The Flight Plan is divided into a number of different Volumes; these are contained in separate binders as the entire document would be too bulky for ready use in flight.
The basic version of the document here is Change A dated 27 March 1972. Change B made a significant number of hand written amendments on 7 April 1972. Further changes will have been made up until, and during, the flight.
The copy of the Flight Plan included here is derived from two different sources:
The cover, introductory material and Sections 1, 2 and 4 were scanned from photocopies of an original copy of the Flight Plan. The copy was kindly provided by University of Houston Clear Lake. On the original, manuscript changes were made in red ink, which came out very light on the copies and, in turn, scanned poorly.
Sections 3, 5 and 6 were provided by David Woods from microfilms provided by the National Archives and Records Administration, Fort Worth. The images were obtained by digitally photographing microfilm copies, providing a clearer digital copy than the scans from hard-copy images. However, the microfilm did not cover all sections of the Flight Plan. Missing sections and a few pages where legibility was poor were provided from the University of Houston Clear Lake copy.
The separate sections of the Flight Plan can be downloaded for viewing in PDF format using Adobe Acrobat.
