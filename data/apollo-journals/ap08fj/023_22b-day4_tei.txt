Apollo 8's final act around the Moon on Christmas Day, 1968, is to fire its main engine for 3 minutes, 18 seconds and accelerate out of lunar orbit onto an Earthward trajectory. From the Moon's frame of reference, the CSM will go onto an escape trajectory. However, the Moon's linear velocity around Earth is about one kilometre per second. The TEI burn calls for Apollo 8 to change its velocity by 1.0736 kilometres per second. Looked at from the point of view of Earth, the TEI burn is effectively cancelling the Moon's orbital motion. This will bring Apollo 8 to a near halt, from Earth's perspective. The Moon will then continue on its month-long course around Earth, and move out from underneath the spacecraft, which will then begin to fall back to its home planet.
Apollo 8 has just gone behind the Moon for the last time and out of radio communication with Earth.

And at 88 hours, 51 minutes, we show Loss of Signal with the spacecraft. Our next communications with Apollo 8 should come in about 37 minutes. We are now about 28 minutes prior to our Trans-Earth Injection maneuver. As the spacecraft went over the horizon, Capsule Communicator Ken Mattingly passed along, for the second time, the word that all systems are Go. And we got a very terse 'Roger' back from the spacecraft. At 88 hours, 52 minutes into the flight; this is Apollo Control, Houston.

088:52:05 Lovell (onboard): I should see Peacock rise over that - I'm just amazed the way this thing operates.
088:52:24 Borman (onboard): A pretty fantastic week, isn't it?
088:52:29 Lovell (onboard): Going to get better.
088:52:31 Borman (onboard): Yeah.
088:53:09 Lovell (onboard): This is utterly fantastic, though. This pawl line is lined up exactly with Gruis.
088:53:27 Borman (onboard): You know what I think made me sick that night?
088:53:29 Anders (onboard): What?
088:53:30 Borman (onboard): That damned pill I took.
088:53:32 Anders (onboard): What pill did you take?
088:53:34 Borman (onboard): Seconal - one of the big ones
088:53:36 Anders (onboard): Oh, is that right?
088:53:36 Borman (onboard): I didn't know you had small ones. I'd have taken one of those.
088:53:42 Anders (onboard): Maybe you got the flu.
088:53:44 Borman (onboard): Maybe I did, I don't know, but it seems like you guys would have gotten it.
088:53:50 Lovell (onboard): Well. I think that basically your stomach was just upset because you can get it very easily. There's nothing wrong, you know.
088:53:54 Borman (onboard): Yeah, I know, but I never had it before, not even in zero-g airplane, which is a - a real...
088:54:39 Anders (onboard): I hope this baby holds out for another 2½ days. It sure has performed admirably, hasn't it?
088:54:44 Borman (onboard): Yep.
088:34:52 Lovell (onboard): Gentlemen, Peacock should be rising above the Moon right now.
088:55:12 Lovell (onboard): And there it is. Just a minute, And I'll verify it.
088:55:33 Lovell (onboard): Okay, I confirm Peacock.
088:55:35 Borman (onboard): Okay, Bill, checklist.
088:55:36 Anders (onboard): Okay.
Bill reads from the bottom of page G-44 in the CMP Checklist.
088:55:41 Borman (onboard): You can leave that off - Looks like we're going to be burning in the daylight anyway.
088:55:47 Anders (onboard): Okay. Drive trunnion [to] less than 5 degrees.
088:55:51 Lovell (onboard): Okay. Optics, zero, zero.
088:55:53 Anders (onboard): And G&N Power Optics, Off.
088:55:55 Lovell (onboard): Optics, zero. Don't hit the IMU switch; Optics, Off.
088:56:02 Anders (onboard): Okay, why don't you - Frank, you can have your lights ups I guess - Unless you wanted to check your star.
088:56:09 Lovell (onboard): Too late, I'm not checking.
088:56:10 Anders (onboard): Frank, let me come down the other side.
088:56:12 Borman (onboard): I doubt if I'll be able to.
088:56:13 Anders (onboard): No, I mean around the other side.
088:56:17 Anders (onboard): I guess you probably won't; you'll be pitched into the Moon, won't you?
088:56:18 Borman (onboard): Yeah, that's the trouble, I - I just barely get - then when I do see it, I see a lit horizon.
088:56:27 Anders (onboard): Okay, Verb 37, Enter; 40, Enter.
This takes them into Program 40 and the top of page G-45 in the CMP Checklist.
088:56:35 Anders (onboard): BMAG Mode, 3, Rate 2.

088:56:59 Anders (onboard): Okay, align spacecraft roll to GDC. You got...
088:57:09 Borman (onboard): Okay.
088:57:10 Anders (onboard): 16 minutes. Do you went to wait awhile to do this?
088:57:13 Borman (onboard): Well, It's already aligned. I'll do it now, Bill - I don't think I'll have to do much - Put in a little bit of yaw that way.
088:57:29 Anders (onboard): Okay, align spacecraft roll and GDC aligned. We'll trim it again here - before the burn.
088:57:36 Anders (onboard): Stability Control System's circuit breakers, panel 8. Closed.
088:57:40 Borman (onboard): Alright. Now, let's watch this, Jim.

088:57:44 Borman (onboard): Don't want to leave that, out.
088:57:45 Anders (onboard): I'm going to check mine over here, too.
088:57:51 Borman (onboard): They're all Closed.

088:59:01 Borman (onboard): Alright.
088:59:02 Anders (onboard): For 13 minutes.
088:59:27 Anders (onboard): Boy, it's blacker than pitch out here.
088:59:29 Borman (onboard): Yeah, I know it.
088:59:37 Lovell (onboard): Okay, (yawn) you're going to burn with the lights on anyway, aren't you, because you've got to get sunlight.
088:59:40 Borman (onboard): Probably will, yeah.
088:59:44 Lovell (onboard): Yeah, I watched the Sun - I watched that star rise, and I could just see the black horizon of the Moon fade away and the star come up and - right on it.
089:00:11 Anders (onboard): Okay, if we get a Main A or an AC1 failure, you change gimbal drives, right?
089:00:16 Borman (onboard): Okay.
089:00:19 Anders (onboard): You got a Main B or an AC 2 failure, don't change gimbal drives or do anything, except put your gimbals to - from Auto to 1.
089:00:36 Lovell (onboard): (Singing)
089:01:24 Anders (onboard): Do you see anything hanging around that could come down?
089:01:28 Lovell (onboard): I hope not.
089:01:53 Borman (onboard): Tell you one thing these flights are good for: an old fatty like me, I bet I lost a lot of weight. I didn't eat much those first two days. and I didn't - didn't even get much to eat today.
089:02:23 Borman (onboard): When is the ignition, 89:19, huh?
089:02:27 Lovell (onboard): Mmm hmm.
089:02:29 Anders (onboard): Pretty sunrise.
089:02:32 Borman (onboard): Yeah.
089:02:47 Lovell (onboard): I'm doing a P23 right after we leave this place, huh?
089:02:51 Borman (onboard): Yeah.
089:03:04 Borman (onboard): Is it boiling, Bill?
089:03:06 Anders (onboard): No, I hope not. It looks low. It's just cold in there.
089:03:21 Lovell (onboard): It does look a little low. When did I say I had the star?
089:03:28 Borman (onboard): What time?
089:03:29 Anders (onboard): Huh?
089:03:30 Lovell (onboard): Because we still have 60 degrees to go there, if we want to be parallel - perpendicular - horizontal to the horizon.
089:03:39 Anders (onboard): Perpendicular (laughter)!
089:03:40 Lovell (onboard): The horizontal, because I was 60 degrees down and I - I just saw the...
089:03:47 Anders (onboard): We're still looking at the Moon - flat at the Moon.
089:03:53 Lovell (onboard): Well, not really.
089:03:54 Anders (onboard): Not flat at it.
089:03:55 Lovell (onboard): I hope not.
089:03:56 Borman (onboard): Oh, no, not flat at it, but boy, it's black out there.
089:04:33 Anders (onboard): If you don't got G&N ignition, what are you going to do?
089:04:36 Borman (onboard): Direct SPS.
089:04:38 Anders (onboard): Wouldn't it be smart to take it around again?
089:04:40 Borman (onboard): Why? If we didn't got it this time, why would we get it better the next time?
089:44:47 Anders (onboard): The burn...
089:04:48 Borman (onboard): There's a 10-degree excursion on this thing.
089:04:53 Anders (onboard): Make sure you hit the corridor.
089:05:14 Borman (onboard): You're right. It would be smart to take it around again.
089:05:18 Anders (onboard): Get set up to do an SPS burn, huh?
089:05:20 Borman (onboard): Auto SPS.
089:05:23 Anders (onboard): I haven't looked at your G - you might still be able to get...
089:05:27 Borman (onboard): Wait a second; let me check it.
089:05:28 Anders (onboard): ...get G&N errors.
089:05:38 Lovell (onboard): (singing, whistling)
089:06:17 Anders (onboard): Now, you should see something. Yeah, there it comes.
089:06:20 Borman (onboard): Where do you see it?
089:06:21 Lovell (onboard): 6 minutes to recheck.
089:06:22 Borman (onboard): Oh, yes, it...
089:06:24 Anders (onboard): I see it off the side of the terminator from sunrise.
089:06:34 Lovell (onboard): I wonder if that - that sort of a zodiacal light was a glare off the optics, or something.
089:06:40 Anders (onboard): You ought to draw a little picture of it, and people could tell you what it was.
089:06:49 Borman (onboard): You got the gimbal thing handy right off the bat?
089:06:53 Anders (onboard): Yeah, why don't we write that down?
089:06:54 Borman (onboard): Minus 0...
089:06:55 Lovell (onboard): (LMP?) 40 plus 157.
089:07:00 Borman (onboard): Is it 157? Not 151?
089:07:06 Lovell (onboard): I'll check on the 11 PAD. 157.
089:07:10 Borman (onboard): Okay.
089:07:11 Lovell (onboard): ...in there.
089:07:13 Anders (onboard): I bet we had the - The weight hadn't - the trim hadn't - changed any since the last time. (Laughter). Getting worried there for a minute.
089:07:21 Lovell (onboard): We've been eating a lot of food.
089:07:24 Borman (onboard): Let's see now, that's 2 - 2 minutes and 13 seconds. Is that what we said? 2:18.
089:07:31 Borman (onboard): 138 seconds.
089:07:34 Lovell (onboard): 2:18 must give you a slow return home.
089:07:35 Borman (onboard): Yeah.
089:07:37 Anders (onboard): You got your strut in?
089:07:41 Borman (onboard): Yeah. it's in.
089:07:44 Anders (onboard): Probably, one of the things we've been hearing is these oxygen masks snapping up and down.
089:08:02 Anders (onboard): Boy, it took three acts of Congress to get those little strings.
089:08:07 Anders (onboard): Oh. That - that's peculiar, isn't it?
089:08:12 Borman (onboard): Yeah, looks to me like we're going right at it. Doesn't it look like that to you?
089:08:19 Lovell (onboard): Why is it we do all these burns upside down?
089:08:21 Borman (onboard): So you can see.
089:08:23 Lovell (onboard): (Laughter) You want to look at that?
089:08:25 Lovell, Borman (onboard): (Laughter)
089:08:28 Anders (onboard): If it makes you feel bad, look out the side windows.
089:08:31 Borman (onboard): Yeah, that makes it look better.
089:08:39 Borman (onboard): I've got - coming up on 10 minutes.
089:10:12 Borman (onboard): Okay, 9 minutes, right now on...
089:10:17 Borman (onboard): Mark.
089:30:27 Lovell (onboard): (singing)
089:10:42 Anders (onboard): Hey, don't forget your ullage.
089:10:43 Borman (onboard): Yeah, Geeze, don't let me forget that.
089:20:45 Anders (onboard): How many seconds do you need?
089:10:47 Borman (onboard): 15 seconds.
089:10:48 Lovell (onboard): Four-jet ullage.
089:10:49 Anders (onboard): Okay, we better write that down.
089:10:55 Anders (onboard): Ullage will be at 89:19:01. Okay?
089:11:02 Borman (onboard): Yes. You're going to call it off, right?
089:13:07 Anders (onboard): Well, I'll try to remember - Got it in there.
089:11:21 Borman (onboard): Oh, yeah.
089:11:14 Lovell (onboard): Yes. Ullage as required down there, I guess. You'll see 15 seconds right on here.
089:11:20 Anders (onboard): 15 seconds.
089:11:23 Borman (onboard): Yes.
089:11:24 Lovell (onboard): [Garble].
089:11:59 Lovell (onboard): All it does is let you see whether it's there or not; then if it is, it doesn't do anything.
089:12:03 Anders (onboard): Yeah, I know, but it drifts off a little. The deadband affects it, I guess.
089:12:07 Lovell (onboard): Oh.
089:12:16 Anders (onboard): Boy, you think you're going to burn right into the - water - I mean, right into the sand.
089:12:18 Lovell (onboard): Did you have trouble scooping up those type of rocks? You said you went up to West Texas for that.
089:12:24 Borman (onboard): 7 minutes, coming up on 6 minutes.
089:12:27 Anders (onboard): Okay.

089:15:54 Borman (onboard): Hey, listen. It looks to me like I'm going to burn right into the ground. Oh! There's the horizon. Hurry! We're going the right way.
089:14:02 Anders (onboard): Boy. You sure can't tell when you're...
089:16:03 Lovell (onboard): 3.2 degrees at TIG Minus 3.
089:16:07 Borman (onboard): What is it?
089:16:08 Lovell (onboard): 3.2 degrees at TIG minus 3 - right about now.
089:16:11 Borman (onboard): Okay, I can - It looks good.

This is Apollo Control, Houston at 89 hours, 19 minutes into the flight. We're now less than 30 seconds to the scheduled time of ignition for the maneuver to start Apollo 8 on its course back to Earth. In the last 15 seconds, prior to ignition, the crew will be burning their Service Propulsion System - rather the Reaction Control System engines to settle propellants. And here in Mission Control Center, we have just counted down to the burn. We should have ignition at this time. That will be a 3-minute and 18-second burn nominally. It will increase the spacecraft velocity by about 3,522 feet per second or some 2,395 miles per hour. Following the maneuver, The spacecraft should have a velocity of about 8,800 feet per second - some 6,000 miles per hour. And here in Mission Control, it is relatively quiet, as it has been since we lost communications with the spacecraft as they went over the Moon's horizon. At this point, flight controllers here in Mission Control, as with the rest of the world, they are waiting.
089:18:47 Anders (onboard): Flight Recorder going to Record.
089:16:48 Lovell (onboard): Stand by to start ullage.
089:18:50 Anders (onboard): Proceed.
089:18:51 Lovell (onboard): Proceed.
089:18:55 Anders (onboard): I'll give you a mark for ullage.
089:18:56 Borman (onboard): Okay.
089:18:58 Lovell (onboard): He's got it right here.
089:19:00 Anders (onboard): 17, 16.
089:19:02 Lovell (onboard): Mark.
089:19:03 Anders (onboard): Ullage!
089:19:06 Anders (onboard): Proceed when you need to.
089:19:12 Lovell (onboard): Proceed.
089:19:13 Borman (onboard): I'm proceeding.
089:19:16 Anders (onboard): Two valves. Good shape.
089:19:21 Borman (onboard): Two valves.
089:19:22 Anders (onboard): Four valves.
089:19:32 Lovell (onboard): Pressure's holding.
089:19:43 Anders (onboard): It's looking real good.
089:19:45 Borman (onboard): Pressurized.
089:20:16 Anders (onboard): Burned for 1 minute.
089:20:18 Borman (onboard): Okay.

Coming up in just a few seconds now, we should have shutdown of the Service Propulsion System engine on the spacecraft. That should have occurred at 89 hours - or rather will be occurring at 89 hours, 22 minutes, 34 seconds. Actually, we are just a little less than a minute from that event. And the clock here in Mission Control Center that is counting down to the time when we will reacquire the spacecraft shows that we have 6 minutes, 30 seconds until reacquisition.
089:22:27 Anders (onboard): Stand by.
089:22:35 Anders (onboard): 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Stop.
089:22:41 Borman (onboard): Okay.

089:23:10 Borman (onboard): Okay.
At this point, the SPS engine should be shut down and we will now be waiting for the spacecraft to come over the lunar horizon and give us a report on their status. We now show 5 minutes, 45 seconds until reacquistion.
089:23:11 Anders (onboard): TVC Servo Power, 1 and 2. Off.

This is Apollo Control, Houston. We now show less than 30 seconds until reacquistion. We'll stand by for the first words from the Apollo 8 crew as they come over the lunar horizon, and into acquisition.
We have RF signal, and there's a little bit of a cheer going up from the flight controllers here. We should be hearing from the crew shortly.
Our station at Honeysuckle, Australia, reports that we do have a radio signal from the spacecraft. They're having a bit of trouble locking up at this point, to the point where we can get voice communication from the crew.

This is Houston. Our capsule communicator in that last exchange was astronaut Donald K. Slayton, Chief of Flight Crew Operations here at the Manned Spacecraft Center.
Shortly after we acquired the spacecraft and established communications with the crew, here in the Control Center, our big display up in the front changed from a lunar map to an Earth map and the colors on it are red and green. We also had a Christmas tree brought in and it's now standing down in the front of the Control Center. It looks like it stands about 6 feet tall and it's decorated with lights and tinsel and with a big blue ornament up on top.

089:59:01 Mattingly: Apollo 8, Houston. We'd like to have you cycle your zero optics switch prior to beginning P52.
089:59:11 Borman: Roger. We're gonna see if we can find some stars here before we do this P52.
089:59:18 Mattingly: Rog. And, I got a couple of words for you. Jack (Schmitt)'s been watching you since LOI, and he has a few words he wanted to give you.
089:59:30 Borman: Go ahead.
Harrison (Jack) Schmitt now joins the conversation. Schmitt is a scientist-astronaut from NASA's 1965 fourth cohort. Although he came to the program with no previous military or aviation experience, he proved a quick study while at the same time providing valuable scientific training to the Apollo crews.
089:59:31 Schmitt: Typhoid Jack here, and we've got some good words here that originated at the Cape with a bunch of friends of yours. And it's sort of in a paraphrase of a poem that you're probably familiar with. Do you read me, Apollo 8?
Schmitt, from a 2003 e-mail to David Woods: "During the last week of Apollo 8 training, with which I was deeply involved, I came down with a case of intestinal flu. As a result, I immediately isolated myself from physical contact with the crew. Frank, however, initially thought that his bout of space adaptation intestinal discomfort was the consequence of being exposed to me. Thus, references to 'Typhoid Jack.' If you look at his book, I think that he later admitted that it was a result of space adaptation."
089:59:50 Borman: You're loud and clear, Jack.
089:59:53 Schmitt: Okay.
"Twas the night before Christmas and way out in space,
the Apollo 8 crew had just won the Moon race.
The head sets were hung by the consoles with care,
in hopes that Chris Kraft soon would be there.
Frank Borman was nestled all snug in his bed,
while visions of REFSMMATs danced in his head;
and Jim Lovell, in his couch, and Anders, in the bay,
were racking their brains over a computer display.
When out of the DSKY, there arose such a clatter,
Frank sprang from his bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the sextant he flew like a flash,
to make sure they weren't going to crash.
The light on the breast of the Moon's jagged crust,
gave a luster of green cheese to the gray lunar dust.
When what to his wondering eyes should appear,
but a Burma Shave sign - saying 'Kilroy was here'. [Laughter.]
But Frank was no fool; he knew pretty quick
that they had been first; this must be a trick.
More rapid than rockets, his curses they came.
He turned to his crewmen and called them a name.
Now Lovell, now Anders, now don't think I'd fall,
for that old joke you've written up on the wall.
They spoke not a word, but grinning like elves,
and laughed at their joke in spite of themselves.
Frank sprang to his couch, to the ship gave a thrust,
and away they all flew past the gray lunar dust.
But we heard them explain ere they flew around the Moon,
Merry Christmas to Earth; we'll be back there real soon."
Great job gang,
090:01:30 Borman: Thank you very much. That was a very good poem; but in order to win the race, you have got to end up on the carriers.
090:01:38 Schmitt: We'll see you there.
090:01:40 Lovell: Hey, Jack. You really got Bill trained. [Laughter.]
090:01:44 Anders: Okay.
090:01:45 Schmitt: I certainly hope so.
090:01:47 Schmitt: You did pretty well, Jim. You must have talked on the way out there. [Laughter.]
Four years later, on December 14, 1972, Jack will give an encore performance by reading an Apollo 17-themed version of the same poem from the Moon shortly before he and Gene Cernan lift off from the surface.

090:07:21 Borman: Houston, this is Apollo 8.
090:07:24 Mattingly: Go ahead.
090:07:28 Borman: Roger. We got an alignment with your new REFSMMAT now. What's on the program here? You want us in P23 and then what?
090:07:40 Mattingly: Looks like some sleep's coming up.
090:07:46 Borman: That's what I wanted you to say. We used up the gimbal angles of 10 and 45 with the - this REFSMMAT, right?
090:07:54 Mattingly: Affirmative.
090:07:58 Borman: Okay.

090:13:56 Mattingly: Apollo 8, Houston.
090:14:00 Borman: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
090:14:03 Mattingly: Rog. Notice that you're starting on your P23 which is the last scheduled activity. Initial tracking looks like the initial midcourse may be less than the 4-foot-per-second on the first guess. And we've looked at your burn data, and it's all just as smooth as you said; everything on there looked real nominal. Systems now look good; looks like in PTC attitude, we should be able to switch omni's for you, if you would like to do that. We were having good success with predicting, on the way out, where to switch the antennas; and if it'll help you, why, we can do that on the way back in.
090:14:48 Borman: That'd be nice if you could do it, but we will keep one man at the shop to watch the gimbal angles; but if you could switch the ang - the omnis, it would sure save us a lot of problems.
090:14:58 Mattingly: Okay. We'll do that. When you get in that PTC attitude, why, we'll - we'll let you know when we're taking command on the omni antenna switching.
090:15:10 Borman: Okay. [Pause.] Just be careful what you do with the tape recorder. Bill's a little sensitive about that.
090:15:25 Mattingly: Rog. We were listening to the tape dumps, and it looks like Bill gets a happy new year after all. [Pause.]
090:15:35 Borman: A happy new year? How come, again. Is that an in joke?
090:15:40 Mattingly: No, we got that off of his tape dump; he and Jim were discussing that one.
090:15:48 Borman: Oh, yeah. That's right.
Earlier, Bill had quipped to Jim that he didn't mind spending Christmas Eve at the Moon, provided he was not still there come New Year's Eve.

This is Apollo Control, Houston at 90 hours, 18 minutes. Our displays here in Mission Control are now beginning to show the effects of that Trans-Earth Injection maneuver. We show an altitude above the Moon at this time of 2,802 nautical miles [5,189 km]. Our spacecraft velocity is 6,050 feet per second [1,844 m/s], and slowing. And our weight following that maneuver is now 32,180 pounds [14,597 kg]. On board the spacecraft at the present time, the crew is finishing up some last minute activities connected with onboard navigation and then they plan to get a little bit of rest, Frank Borman is scheduled to be in a sleep period at this time. And we've had some indications from the crew that Lovell and Anders also hope to get a little bit of rest as soon as possible. We have some brief conversations with the crew that we've recorded since our previous report; we'll play those back for you now, and then stand by briefly for any live communications with the spacecraft.

This is Apollo Control, Houston at 90 hours, 50 minutes into the flight of Apollo 8. At the present time our spacecraft is at an altitude above the Moon of 4,504 nautical miles [8,341 km] and traveling at a speed of 5,645 feet per second [1,721 m/s]. We've heard very little from the crew since our last report. We do have a couple of brief exchanges on tape, and we'll play those back for you and then stand by for any conversation.

This is Apollo Control. We're expecting Capsule Communicator Ken Mattingly to put in a call to the crew shortly. While we wait for that, we'll pass along some information that we've been requested to gather, and also some additional information on the results of that Trans-Earth Injection maneuver. The Trans-Earth Injection burn occurred on time. It lasted for 3 minutes and 23 seconds. We had originally estimated that it would last about 3 minutes, 18 seconds. We obtained almost precisely the amount of velocity change from that burn that had been planned. The figure that we have at this point is a velocity change of 3,522.8 feet per second. We'd been shooting for 3,522.3 feet per second. So we would only have been off about 5/10 of a foot per second. As a result of that maneuver, our current figure is that splash will occur in the mid-Pacific at 147 hours, 4 minutes, 59 seconds. That's a very precise figure and I doubt it will continue to hold true through the coast phase and trajectory analysis that will be done en route back to Earth. We do anticipate that figure will change. Coming up at 100 hours, 47 minutes, 47 seconds Ground Elapsed Time, we'll be going through the change in the sphere of influence. This will be the point at which the Moon's gravity ceases to be the dominant influence on the spacecraft. That will also be the point at which the spacecraft will reach its minimum inertial velocity and then start to accelerate toward Earth. This will occur at an altitude above the Moon of 33,821 nautical miles [62,636 km] and at that point will be 175,528 [nautical] miles [325,078 km] from Earth. The velocity at that point will be 4,839 feet per second [1,475 m/s] with respect to the Moon. And it will be 4,176 feet per second [1,273 m/s] with respect to Earth. We also were requested to pass along some figures on altitude and velocity at the beginning of the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver and at the end of that maneuver. At the beginning of the maneuver, our velocity was about 5,350 feet per second [1,631 m/s], and following the maneuver, our velocity was 8,841 feet per second [2,695 m/s]. Our altitude at the beginning of the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver was 60 nautical miles [111.1 km] above the surface of the Moon. And at the conclusion of that maneuver, 3 minutes and 23 seconds later, it was 66.5 nautical miles [123.2 km]. At the present time our altitude above the Moon is 4,876 nautical miles [9,030 km] and our velocity is 5,587 feet per second [1,703 m/s] and continuing to decrease very gradually. We are still anticipating sometime in the near future a call to the crew and we'll pick back up again when that comes through. This is Apollo Control at 90 hours, 58 minutes into the flight of Apollo 8.

091:10:16 Mattingly: Go ahead, Apollo 8.
091:10:22 Borman: Hey - hey Ken, we've about run out of gas here on this next set of stars. Would you ask your people to be especially alert there watching the systems tonight?
091:10:31 Mattingly: Sure will, Frank.
091:10:36 Borman: Okay. It's maneuver to pitch 10 and yaw 45.
091:10:41 Mattingly: Roger. I have - let's see, we've got a hydrogen purge line here that ought to come on about 91:40 and an oxygen-hydrogen fuel cell purge for 92 hours. [Pause.]
091:10:59 Borman: Okay. Will you call us about those, please?
091:11:02 Mattingly: I sure will. And, let's see, we just wanted to let you know we've got a real good battery charge going here this time. Looks like - it looks just like the ones in the book, and I'd like to get a battery C voltage before you shut down and a sleep report on what you did in...
091:11:22 Borman: Okay.
091:11:23 Mattingly: ...lunar orbit and your plans for the next couple of hours.
091:11:29 Borman: Okay. [Long pause.]
091:11:47 Borman: 37 volts on battery C.
091:11:50 Mattingly: Roger. 37 volts. [Pause.]
091:11:59 Borman: We only got about 2 hours sleep today, max. Ken. We're going to now - Bill's going to stay up awhile, and Jim and I are going to sack out, then we're going to try to rotate to short sleep cycles till we can get back to the normal ones.
091:12:12 Mattingly: Roger, sounds like a good idea. And EECOM on the ground tells us that the flying EECOM (is) to go ahead and put his hydrogen purge line heater on, and we'll get ready for a fuel cell.
091:12:27 Borman: Thank you. He can't turn on his radio. There he goes. [Pause.]
091:12:44 Borman: I hope it won't disappoint anybody too much if we knock off those last two stars, but Jim is just in a daze, and so am I.
091:12:50 Mattingly: Rog. No sweat.
091:12:55 Borman: Thank you. [Long pause.]
091:13:19 Mattingly: Apollo 8. One of the things we'd like to have before you shut down also is a Verb 64 so we can watch these pointing angles.
091:13:30 Borman: Roger.
091:13:35 Mattingly: Hey, Frank, you might be interested; they are having some trouble with the medics' pee tube.
091:13:45 Borman: What?
091:13:48 Anders: The medics can't clean out their pee tube. [Pause.]
091:14:01 Borman: Oh, is that right? It's been so busy.
091:14:02 Mattingly: Oh, yeah. It's worn the thing out at the bearings. [Laughter, Long pause.]
091:14:33 Borman: Hey, Ken, tell the people if you see anything getting close to the gimbal lock to be sure and whistle, too, will you?
091:14:40 Mattingly: We sure will, Frank. You will want to make sure one of you keeps your comm carrier on.
091:14:43 Borman: We'll keep one man with a headset on.
091:14:50 Borman: That's right. We'll keep one man with a comm carrier on.

This is Apollo Control at 91 hours, 22 minutes. Since our last report, we've had a couple of brief conversations with the crew. They indicated that they were very tired and had perhaps gotten about 2 hours of sleep prior to the Trans-Earth Injections maneuver. Frank Borman advised that he and Jim Lovell were going to attempt to get some sleep shortly and that Bill Anders would stand watch while they were getting some sleep and then when one of them awoke, Bill would get some sleep. We'll play back that tape for you and then stand by as our Capsule Communicator puts in a call to the crew.

091:32:23 Anders: Go ahead, Houston.
091:32:25 Mattingly: Okay. In order for us to handle the antenna switching, I guess we'd like to have the Aux Tape switched to Off, and the Tape Forward switch, Off; and we'll be switching between omnis Bravo and Delta. [Long pause.]
091:33:01 Anders: Between what and what?
091:33:05 Mattingly: Okay. We're going to be switching between omnis Bravo and Delta.
091:33:14 Anders: Okay.
091:33:17 Mattingly: All right. And I'm gonna - you bug me when you get over 50 degrees of yaw, so I'll probably be watching that number pretty closely. We'd like to have the Biomed switched to the right position. [Long pause.] Okay. And for your own information: the fuel we show in the different quads I have here if you'd like to copy it.

091:37:46 Anders: How are we doing on the cryos?
091:37:52 Mattingly: Oh, you've got some pretty good numbers on that today. Sent up yesterday, and you had about 160 hours. Well, I'll check that out, but you were fat on cryo. I've got some SPS Delta-V. You've got 3,320. You fly the Service Module RCS through the DAP, you have 142; and through SCS, it's 121. [Long pause.]

This is Apollo Control at 92 hours, 8 minutes into the flight of Apollo 8. And at the present time our spacecraft is at an altitude of 8,545 nautical miles above the Moon, traveling at a speed of some 5,238 feet per second. It's been some time since we've heard from any of the crewmen. At about 91 hours, 25 minutes, we had a report from the spacecraft that Commander Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, Command Module Pilot, would be attempting to get some sleep. And Bill Anders was to stand watch. We do have a small amount of tape of previous conversations that we've had since our last report. We'll play that back for you now.
