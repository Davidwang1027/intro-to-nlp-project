078:58:32 Lovell (onboard): What time is it there? About 2 o'clock?
078:58:42 Lovell (onboard): Are you finished with the computer?
078:58:44 Anders (onboard): Yes, go ahead.
078:59:20 Borman (onboard): How are the systems, Bill?
078:59:25 Anders (onboard): Well, the last time I looked at them, they were pretty good, chief.
078:59:32 Anders (onboard): All the gauges are looking at each other.
079:00:03 Anders (onboard): If you want to say anything about your tracking pass this time, I - Just let me know and we can go into high bit rate.
079:00:15 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
079:00:25 Lovell (onboard): Okay, how about keeping your eye on these camera settings, too, on the next couple of passes?
079:00:29 Anders (onboard): You wanted to be 10 degrees, didn't you?
079:00:33 Lovell (onboard): Yes.
079:00:36 Anders (onboard): Well, overshot, then.
079:00:54 Anders (onboard): Okay, the first one is 1/500th of a second.
079:00:56 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
079:02:05 Lovell (onboard): All those scientists are saying now, "Ohhh, if we only had a geologist onboard.
079:02:10 Anders (onboard): Okay, he couldn't see anything. I took that monocular and tried to eyeball it out the window last time.
079:02:16 Lovell (onboard): Yes?
079:02:18 Anders (onboard): Nothing but a big blur out there. He'd see enough to make it interesting, but not enough to do anything.
079:03:05 Lovell (onboard): Okay, I'm going to go out of here.
079:05:30 Anders (onboard): 4 minutes.
079:05:51 Anders (onboard): Okay. when's your first PCA - TCA?
079:05:56 Lovell (onboard): 79:10.
079:05:58 Anders (onboard): Huh?
079:05:59 Lovell (onboard): 79:10.
079:06:00 Anders (onboard): 79:10?
079:06:04 Lovell (onboard): Yes, sunrise, it says here.
079:06:06 Anders (onboard): I can't hear you.
079:06:07 Lovell (onboard): Sunrise is 79:08.
079:06:08 Anders (onboard): Yes.
079:06:22 Lovell (onboard): We're 3 minutes away; that's 9 degrees.
079:06:35 Lovell (onboard): Oh. boy. I may see the Sun; I'd better be careful too. Hey, there is - there's a - Here's a glow, you can see the Sun come around a little bit.
079:06:44 Anders (onboard): Is that right?
079:06:45 Lovell (onboard): Yes, I can see the Sun come up before it comes up.
079:06:54 Lovell (onboard): Like zodiacal light, a little bit, maybe.
079:06:57 Anders (onboard): Rim brightening, they call it? (Probably means Limb brightening)
079:06:59 Lovell (onboard): Yes.
079:07:27 Lovell (onboard): Yes, you sure can.
079:07:34 Lovell (onboard): Oh boy!
079:07:43 Anders (onboard): Can you describe it?
079:07:50 Lovell (onboard): Yes, it's a real bright glow right in one spot, and it fans out all over the horizon. And I'm just trying to move my eye away, because the Sun's going to peek over here any second now, and it's getting brighter and brighter, and it's get - It's an even light.
079:08:04 Anders (onboard): Bright spot fans out over horizon?
079:08:06 Lovell (onboard): Yes, yes, then it fans up into the air; it's an even light; then all of sudden, it - The Sun is peeking out right now.
079:08:12 Lovell (onboard): Whooo!
079:08:19 Lovell (onboard): See it?
079:08:35 Anders (onboard): Geez, I got a start there. I saw that - some stuff come out of the optics or something; I thought it was a star whirling by.
079:08:53 Lovell (onboard): All right, now you want to roll to keep that trunnion...
079:08:57 Anders (onboard): We wouldn't want - I didn't realize you were that quick. Okay, which way?
079:09:00 Lovell (onboard): Okay, roll - roll left.
079:09:01 Anders (onboard): Roll left, okay.
079:09:03 Anders (onboard): I'm yawing...
079:09:05 Lovell (onboard): Watch her - watch her as she comes down.
079:09:07 Anders (onboard): I yawed a little left.
079:09:09 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
079:09:44 Anders (onboard): How are we doing?
079:09:47 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
079:09:52 Lovell (onboard): Is it 10 degrees left?
079:09:54 Anders (onboard): Yes, right now. You got enough roll? What happened?
079:10:06 Lovell (onboard): I went to Manual. I'll get it for you.
079:10:47 Anders (onboard): You all right? You got your camera on?
079:10:53 Lovell (onboard): I'll put it on, just as soon as we get rid of the Sun.
079:11:11 Lovell (onboard): [Garble] turn it down now.
079:11:16 Anders (onboard): Wait a minute, you - you want me to - you want me to try to avoid it?
079:11:19 Lovell (onboard): Yes, you can pitch down a little bit.
079:11:22 Anders (onboard): Hey, wait a minute, are you - I'm roll - I may roll over 10 degrees.
079:31:29 Anders (onboard): That you that's driving it?
079:11:31 Lovell (onboard): No, I'm not driving it now. Well, I'm driving it now, yes. That's enough. That's enough.
079:11:38 Lovell (onboard): Let me go back there and try this CMC again.
079:11:48 Lovell (onboard): Okay, let's try that one again.
079:11:53 Anders (onboard): Pitch down?
079:12:03 Anders (onboard): We're right smack on 10 degrees.
079:12:06 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
079:12:12 Lovell (onboard): You can pitch down a little more, if you want to.
079:12:14 Anders (onboard): Okay.
079:12:55 Lovell (onboard): Okay, Auto Optics is doing the whole thing for me. Now - get this camera going.
079:13:28 Lovell (onboard): Auto is fairly close.
079:13:52 Lovell (onboard): Fantastic pictures here, Bill.
079:14:36 Lovell (onboard): Give you a Manual Optics.
079:16:01 Lovell (onboard): Oh my gosh!
079:16:02 Anders (onboard): What?
079:16:03 Lovell (onboard): My Auto Optics has put it right on.
079:16:05 Anders (onboard): We going to make that angle, or not?
079:16:14 Lovell (onboard): I'm just letting it run here for a little bit before I try to brake it.
079:16:17 Anders (onboard): It's getting kind of small.
079:16:19 Lovell (onboard): That's - that's okay. Don't bother using up gas. Okay.
079:16:23 Anders (onboard): All right. I already bothered, I'm sorry.
079:16:30 Anders (onboard): I haven't loaded this camera, [garble].
079:17:18 Lovell (onboard): Ahhhh!
079:17:19 Anders (onboard): What? What happened?
079:17:24 Lovell (onboard): Oh, that's okay.
079:17:26 Lovell (onboard): It's chilly in here...
079:17:28 Anders (onboard): Don't - don't wake up Frank.
079:17:29 Lovell (onboard): Oh, okay. Okay.
079:17:37 Lovell (onboard): Yes. Sorry, Frank, I didn't mean to disturb you. Thought I pushed the wrong button.
079:18:13 Lovell (onboard): Okay, what's your attitude now?
079:18:17 Anders (onboard): Seems to - oh, about 6 degrees.
079:18:18 Lovell (onboard): Above?
079:18:19 Anders (onboard): Yes.
079:18:21 Lovell (onboard): Okay, just hold it right there.
079:18:56 Lovell (onboard): Okay, we've got another one coming up. Same procedure.
079:19:06 Lovell (onboard): This is - Now, where's that book?
079:19:14 Lovell (onboard): I've got [garble] book's over there.
079:20:43 Lovell (onboard): Should be coming up on Low right now.
079:21:13 Lovell (onboard): Okay, we're tracking the new one.
079:21:15 Borman (onboard): (Garbled.)
079:21:16 Anders (onboard): Yes?
079:21:17 Borman (onboard): (Garbled.)
079:21:18 Anders (onboard): It's still going on, Frank.
079:23:39 Lovell (onboard): Do we have the recorder on?
079:23:43 Anders (onboard): On LOW bit rate. Do you want to say something?
079:23:46 Lovell (onboard): Yes, well.
079:23:48 Anders (onboard): You're quite welcome. Okay, why don't you stop it, and put it to high bit rate, and put it forward again?

079:24:03 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
079:24:10 Lovell (onboard): (Whistling) Okay.
079:24:13 Lovell (onboard): Tape recorder is where - Record, Forward...
079:24:16 Anders (onboard): Just put it - put it to Stop
079:24:19 Lovell (onboard): Which one is it, the center?
079:24:21 Anders (onboard): Yes.
079:24:22 Anders (onboard): No, no, no, no. Push this forward.
079:24:24 Lovell (onboard): Forward?
079:24:25 Anders (onboard): Put it this way in the middle.
079:24:26 Lovell (onboard): Yes.
079:24:42 Lovell (onboard): ...several comments on...
079:24:43 Anders (onboard): Good and loud; they'll never be able to hear you there.
079:24:46 Lovell (onboard): Several comments on landmark tracking. The last time I used Auto Optics, putting in the coordinates, I found the first time in Manual Optics for CP-1, the G&N system did quite well. It tracked almost as good as I could track manually right on the target, and I tipped it over just at the last moment to take my five marks. There - appears to be very smooth tracking; no problem - with this particular system. I'm now in CP-2; I have it just below the horizon now, and it's tracking down from the horizon automatically.
079:25:32 Lovell (onboard): Okay. Now, what do you want me to do?
079:25:36 Anders (onboard): The same deal in reverse.
079:25:40 Lovell (onboard): Okay, I'll go to - Stop?
079:25:45 Anders (onboard): Yes.
079:27:45 Lovell (onboard): Look at that! It is right on!
079:32:32 Borman (onboard): Are you using this map for anything, Jim?
079:33:23 Anders (onboard): Got the rate, Jim?
079:38:42 Lovell (onboard): No, this is pretty good, though, I didn't - Maybe that could be the problem. Maybe I could [garble].
079:38:56 Lovell (onboard): Oh, it's scheduled a little later in the day [garble].
079:39:11 Anders (onboard): What is that, Jim?
079:39:42 Lovell (onboard): What was that? [Garble].
079:39:47 Anders (onboard): Oh, that?
079:39:48 Lovell (onboard): You hear that noise over there?
079:39:49 Anders (onboard): Yes.
079:42:17 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
079:44:17 Anders (onboard): How long does this hand controller stay armed?
079:44:23 Anders (onboard): Hey, Jim.
079:44:24 Lovell (onboard): Yes.
079:44:25 Anders (onboard): This hand controller's armed.

This is Apollo Control, Houston; 79 hours, 46 minutes into the flight. Mike Collins has sent up two calls and we've got no response - we think we've got some keying action, but that's all. To date, we've - on the basis of earlier revs, we've gotten used to now, to turning to our EECOM and asking the first question as we come around the corner, 'how's the evaporator' and the answer is this time it's working great. They apparently have the right handle on it. As I mentioned earlier, it's seeing large temperature excursions, apparently no larger than people within the project office and at North American and, I'm sure, at the Air Corporation had felt they might see. And I know many people in those positions who are very much relieved to see these excursions and all - excursions of only 40 to 50 degrees.
079:46:47 Lovell (onboard): This should be [garble] or [garble]?
079:47:16 Collins: Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over. [No answer.
Comm break.
079:47:20 Anders (onboard): Houston, Apollo 8.
079:47:29 Lovell (onboard): Try them again.
079:47:30 Anders (onboard): Houston, Apollo 8.
079:48:43 Collins: Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over. [No answer.]
079:48:47 Anders (onboard): Houston, this is Apollo 8. Over.
079:50:09 Lovell (onboard): Did you see our landing site, Frank?
079:50:11 Borman (onboard): Huh?
Your browser does not support the audio element.
[Download MP3 audio file of PAO announcer recording. Clip courtesy John Stoll, ACR Senior Technician at NASA Johnson.]
Still no - no answer, no additional calls as a matter of fact. Mike Collins tries again. And we might have a ground antenna problem. Checking our ground stations now. In this temperature area, the evaporator, of course, isn't the only area seeing the same order of temperature excursions. I'm looking at a Command Service Module RCS summary here, which shows - presents temperature readings at four or five points, on various tanks surfaces in the Service Module and, see one valve inlet temperature here which is a specific six digit identified point which varies the low and the high are listed over any given rev and they happen to range from 50 degree Fahrenheit to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. There are four other readings in the Service Module area which range from 50 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
It's been nearly six minutes now since we acquired and just getting a general background noise. We've had no additional - no additional attempts to raise the spacecraft. So based on what EECOM says, we may wait a few minutes before trying additional calls. We'll be back up then. It's 79 hours, 51 minutes into the flight; this is Apollo Control, Houston.

079:52:18 Anders: Reading you fine.
079:52:20 Collins: Okay.

079:55:45 Collins: Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
079:55:51 Lovell: Roger, Houston. A few words on our optics tracking system. I used auto optics for control points 1 and 2 on the backside, and they worked beautifully, tracked both targets for me. And I went to the control point 3, as designated in our orbital control book, to see the latitude and longitude that was given to me and used auto optics to track that particular coordinate with it, and it was very close to the actual tracking plot. I picked the mark there where I did a final marking and recorded latitude and longitude. I'm now about to come up on the landing site and using auto optics, using the coded input to see how that works. [Long pause.]
079:56:57 Collins: Roger, Apollo 8.

Apollo Control here. In this lull, we perhaps should take advantage at least to point out to the people in the newsrooms, who, may not - not have not noticed it yet. Our latest data display on our - one of our walls, there's the words Merry Christmas, Apollo 8. The Merry is in red letters, the Christmas is in white letters, and the Apollo 8 is in blue letters. That display went up about an hour ago. I guess it technically should be called data. The consensus here is of course, that the crew is and remains quite busy and we're going to have some updates in the course of this pass, the sixth rev - here it is.

079:59:52 Anders: Roger. We'll take them when we're doing the P52, if that's okay.

And this is Apollo Control, Houston; at 80 hours, 1 minute into the flight. We apparently are not going to have very much communication at this point. We'll come back up when we do. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
080:01:05 Anders (onboard): Yes.
080:02:48 Lovell (onboard): Well, you can almost [garble].
080:02:53 Lovell (onboard): I'll do one thing until I get up there, but [garble].
080:06:25 Lovell (onboard): You want to take a look at this? [Garble] it's something - I don't know what.
080:06:52 Lovell (onboard): Just wonderful [garble] right on [garble].

080:07:56 Lovell: Mike, Apollo 8.
080:07:58 Collins: Apollo 8, go ahead.
080:08:03 Lovell: Roger. I drew up in Auto Optics now on the landing site. It would just warm up old Jack Schmitt's heart. The auto optics is tracking perfectly on the - on the target, and the two IPs turned out beautifully. I have a beautiful view of it. The first IP's just barely beneath the vertical now, and the second one's coming up. It's just a grand view.
080:08:28 Collins: Glad to hear it, Jim. Jack's listening. [Long pause.]
080:08:45 Lovell: For Jack's information, the Sun angles that we see now from the first IP, second IP, and the B-1 are just right, I think, for landing conditions. The shadows aren't too deep for you to get confused, but the land is - has texture to it, and there are enough shadows to make everything stand out. [Pause.]
080:09:15 Anders: If Jack's listening, tell him that the optics may be doing all right, but the eyeballs are having a little trouble looking through all this smear on the windows.
080:09:25 Collins: Roger. Understand the optics are doing better than the eyeballs. How about the cameras?
080:09:33 Anders: The cameras have the same smear to look through. The rendezvous windows are okay, but they're so small and looking in the wrong directions here so far.
080:09:42 Collins: Roger.
080:09:43 Anders: I think the vertical stereo will be okay.
Comm break.
080:11:10 Anders: It certainly looks like we're picking the more interesting parts of the Moon to land in. The back side looks like a sand pile my kids have been playing in for a long time. It's all beat up, no definition. Just a lot of bumps and holes. [Pause.]
080:11:27 Lovell: I'm looking 2P-2 right now, Houston, and it's a great spot.
080:11:33 Anders: The area that we're over right now gives some hint of possible volcanics, though I really can't eyeball it at the moment to pin that down. There are some craters and build-ups that just definitely suggest volcanic activity.
080:11:52 Collins: Rog. Understand, Bill, and understand Jim thinks the ole 2P-2 is a winner. [Pause.]
080:12:06 Anders: Yeah, that backside doesn't look too interesting.
080:12:10 Collins: Roger.
080:12:15 Anders: That's relatively speaking, of course.
080:12:18 Collins: Of course.

This is Apollo Control, Houston; 80 hours, 15 minutes into the flight. In the last few minutes we've recorded some most enthusiastic comments from Jim Lovell on his assignment. Comments from Lovell and from Anders on their tracking assignment during this - these inner - these middle revs around the Moon. Lovell pays astronaut Jack Schmitt, Harrison Schmitt actually, a PhD in Geology, a great compliment with the work that he and other members of the Lunar Mapping Science Laboratory here in MSC have done in picking various Moonmarks or landmarks leading to the sites we've picked out as probable landing sites for subsequent lunar missions. Jim, as I say, is most enthusiastic about the clarity of the ridges and the rilles that he was given to work with. And Anders chimes in that he thinks it's all great too, except he wishes the windows were more easily seen through. Here's the conversation, the way it's been going the last few minutes.
080:12:29 Lovell (onboard): Frank, we're just finishing up the [garble] here. [Garble].
080:14:56 Lovell (onboard): We've got to copy this [garble], too.
080:16:55 Anders (onboard): [Garble] Frank, the SPS is about [garble] hours [garble].
080:16:59 Borman (onboard): Okay.
080:17:06 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
080:17:07 Anders (onboard): We got about 4 hours [garble]. It's about 4½ hours.
080:17:32 Lovell (onboard): You know, [garble] the trash bag, we ought to get out that [garble] and look it over.
080:18:04 Anders (onboard): Same set.
080:18:05 Lovell (onboard): Do you need that any more, Bill?
080:18:07 Anders (onboard): Lan - landing site, landing site. Yes.
080:18:13 Lovell (onboard): Do you need that any more, Bill?
080:18:14 Anders (onboard): Do I need what? No, I don't need any more.
080:18:19 Anders (onboard): You might as well sleep, or one of us might as well, because it doesn't - doesn't take two guys to do it, and you can't see anything else anyway. The other guy's just sitting around scratching his rear.
080:18:43 Lovell (onboard): Have they sent us updates, yet?
080:18:45 Borman (onboard): No.

080:18:57 Lovell (onboard): Go ahead, Houston.
080:18:58 Collins: We have you on the High Gain Antenna. We'd like you to take the DSE and dump it. Over.
080:19:05 Lovell: Roger. [Long pause.]
080:19:06 Lovell (onboard): Get all - the figures?

080:19:08 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
080:19:09 Anders (onboard): It's up to him.
080:19:13 Borman (onboard): Have we lost contact with them?
080:19:28 Lovell: Houston. Are you going to use our computer to update our state vector?
080:19:34 Collins: That's affirmative, Jim. We'd - we'd like to - stand by one, and I'll tell you when to go to P00 and Accept.
080:19:45 Lovell: Roger. Then I'll work my 52 around your [garble]. [Long pause.]
080:20:05 Collins: Jim, would you please go to P00 and Accept, and we'll send you a P27, LM state vector update.
080:20:12 Lovell: Roger. You have P00...
080:20:14 Collins: Thank you.
080:20:15 Lovell: ...and Accept.
080:20:16 Collins: Roger. [Long pause.]
080:20:36 Lovell: Houston, this is Apollo 8. We have a little piece of useful information if you're interested in deliberating over it.
080:20:46 Collins: Go ahead. Say again?
080:20:51 Lovell: Roger. Our first control point is very near the terminator, and as the optics were tracking it, I had occasion to watch the Sun come up. And at about 2 minutes before sunrise, you get - the limb begins to brighten up into sort of a fine white haze, a faint glow completely over the space just behind the limb. [Pause.]
080:21:23 Collins: Rog. Understand. About 2 minutes before the Sun comes up, you get a fine white haze radiating out from behind the limb. How far out does it extend?
080:21:34 Lovell: It goes up quite a ways. It takes a fan shape, unlike the sunrise on Earth where the atmosphere affects it. This just sort of is a complete haze all over the local area. It's concentrated at the exact spot the sun comes up at ignition and then goes away from the sun spots. Very interesting.
080:21:54 Collins: Roger, Jim. Thank you. [Long pause.]
080:22:36 Collins: Apollo 8, Houston. We're standing by with your map and TEI-7 updates. [Pause.]
080:22:48 Lovell: Stand by. [Pause.]
080:22:54 Collins: Apollo 8, Houston. You can go back to Block at your computer.
080:23:02 Lovell: Roger. [Long pause.]
080:23:31 Anders: Okay, Mike. We're ready for the map update and - and then the TEI.
080:23:38 Collins: Okay. When you got your - before you get your map book out, the Houston Comm Techs have got a little word for an old ex-CapCom. They say they consider you go on Remote. Over. [Pause.]
080:23:54 Anders: Not permanently, I hope.
080:23:59 Collins: Okay. Your map update for rev 6/7: LOS, 80:57:24; sunrise, 81:06:57; prime meridian, 81:13:02. Are you with me?
080:24:29 Anders: You cut out after the prime meridian. I got it, but not AOS
080:24:33 Collins: AOS, 81:43:05; sunset, 82:19:54; remarks: IP-1, TCA for B-1, 82:07:39; and now I've got four more times for you which are acquisition times for when various things come over the horizon. Over. [Pause.]
080:25:09 Anders: Roger. Go ahead.
080:25:12 Collins: Okay. Control point 1, acquisition time, 81:09:05; control point 2, acquisition time, 81:21:48; control point 3, acquisition time, 81:43:17; B-1 acquisition time, 82:03:54. And I say again, all those ACQ times are when they first come over the horizon. Over. [Pause.]
080:25:54 Anders: Roger. Copy, Houston. And in about 2 seconds, I'll be ready for the TEI.
080:26:01 Collins: All right. [Long pause.]
080:26:13 Anders: I am ready.
080:26:16 Collins: TEI-7; SPS/G&N - stand by one, Bill. [Long pause.]
080:26:55 Anders: Just a matter of general interest, Houston: everybody is feeling good, and the CDR is taking a snooze.
080:27:01 Collins: Roger. Glad to hear it. We're just talking about a water dump down here. We've got one coming up, and it looks like on this rev prior to the time around LOS or just prior to LOS, would be a convenient time to do it. Do you concur?
080:27:20 Anders: Okay. We will. Down to 25 percent again?
080:27:24 Collins: That's affirmative, and we'd also be interested in any comments about what these various dumps have done to your optics, if anything, and how long the effects last after a dump.
080:27:38 Anders: Don't seem to have done anything to the optics, but they've definitely got in some of the windows. There are a few little chunks of ice on window number 1, which is nearest the vent, and also on window number 5 a little bit; windows 2 and 4 remain amazingly clear. [Pause.]
080:28:11 Collins: Roger. Thank you, Bill, and I'm ready to resume the PAD when you are.
080:28:19 Anders: Okay. Press on with the weight.
080:28:22 Collins: All right. Weight, 45701; minus 0.40, plus 1.57; 083:18:20.80; plus 3234.6, minus 0116.8, plus 0573.0. Are you with me so far? Over. [Long pause.]
080:29:08 SC (onboard): I think there's pieces of a [garble].
080:29:10 SC (onboard): I think I'll just hold onto this thing [garble].
080:29:28 Collins: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
080:29:33 Anders: Go ahead, Mike.
080:29:35 Collins: Rog. I got down through Delta-V, X, Y, and Z. Did you copy these? Over.
080:29:44 Anders: No I didn't read a word. I'm still waiting for the weight.
080:29:49 Collins: Roger. Let's go back to the weight: 45701; minus 0.40, plus 1.57. Are you with me? Over.
080:30:09 Anders: Sounds good.
080:30:11 Collins: Okay. GETI, 083:18:20.80; plus 3234.6, minus 0116.8, plus 4 - correction - plus 0573.0. Are you with me? Over.
080:30:52 Anders: Roger.
080:30:53 Collins: Thank you. 179, 009, 001; not applicable, plus 0018.7; 3287.0, 3:07, 3267.6; 42, 088.0, 25.3; 033, down 12.1, left 2.7; plus 07.90, minus 165.00; 1297.3, 36238, 146:44:14; same north set, Sirius and Rigel, roll 129, pitch 155, yaw 010; 4 quads for 15 seconds; horizon on the 2-degree mark at Tignition. Over. [Pause.]
The PAD is interpreted as follows:
Purpose: The PAD is for an emergency burn to return to Earth at the end of Rev 7.
Systems: The burn would be made using the SPS engine, under the control of the Guidance and Navigation system.
CSM Weight (Noun 47): 45,701 pounds (20,730 kg).
Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48): -0.40° and +1.57°.
Time of ignition (Noun 33): 83 hours, 18 minutes, 20.8 seconds.
Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s): X, +3,234.6 (+985.9); Y, -116.8 (-35.6); Z, +573.0 (+174.7). The large positive number in the X direction implies a large prograde component, essentially adding to their orbital velocity, exactly what would be expected from an escape manoeuvre.
Spacecraft attitude: Roll, 179°; Pitch, 9°; Yaw, 1°. The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform which itself has been aligned per the LOI-2 REFSMMAT.
Expected apogee of resulting orbit (Noun 44): Not applicable. Being initiated around the Moon, the apogee of the resulting orbit around Earth is too large to register on the computer.
Expected perigee of resulting orbit (Noun 44): 18.7 nautical miles (34.6 km).
Delta-VT: 3,287.0 fps (1,001.9 m/s). The total sum of the three velocity components.
Burn duration or burn time: 3 minutes, 7 seconds.
Delta-VC: 3,267.6 fps. This figure will be entered into the EMS to allow it to shut down the engine as a backup in case the G&N system fails to do so.
Sextant star: Star 42 (Peacock, or Alpha Pavonis) visible in sextant when shaft and trunnion angles are 88.0° and 25.3° respectively.
Boresight star: Star 33 (Antares, or Alpha Scorpii).
COAS Pitch Angle: Down 12.1°.
COAS X Position Angle: Left 2.7°.
Expected splashdown point (Noun 61): 7.90° north, 165° west; which is in the mid-Pacific.
Range to go at the 0.05 g event: 1,297.3 nautical miles. To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance the CM would travel from the 0.05 g event to landing. This figure will be decremented by the EMS based on signals from its own accelerometer.
Expected velocity at the 0.05 g event: 36,238 fps. This is another entry for the EMS. It is entered into the unit's Delta-V counter and will be decremented based on signals from its own accelerometer.
Predicted GET of 0.05 g event: 146 hours, 44 minutes and 14 seconds GET.
GDC Align stars: Stars to be used for GDC Align purposes are Sirius and Rigel.
GDC Align angles: Roll, 129°; pitch, 155°; yaw, 10°.
There are two additional points given in the PAD. An ullage burn of 15 seconds should be made by all four RCS quads to settle the contents of the half-empty SPS tanks prior to the burn. This is minimise the chance of helium gas being ingested when the engine ignites. The Moon's horizon should be lined up on the rendezvous window's 2° line at the moment of ignition.
080:32:53 Anders: Roger. TEI-7; SPS/G&N; 45701; minus 0.40, plus 1.57; 083:18:20.80; plus 3234.6, minus 0116.8, plus 0573.0; 179, 9 - correction - 009, 001; N/A. Are you with me?
080:33:28 Collins: Yeah, I'm with you, Bill.
080:33:32 Anders: Plus 0018.7; 3287.0, 3:07, 3267.6; 32 - correction - 42, 088.0, 25.3; 033, down 12.1, left 2.7; plus 07.90, minus 165.00; 1297.3, 36238, 146:44:14; same north set, Sirius, Rigel, 129, 155, 010; 4 jet, 15 seconds, 2 degrees on the horizon at TIG.
080:34:26 Collins: That's all correct.
Long comm break.

080:46:25 Anders (onboard): It'd be a good time to do it, because there's more - Jim's really the only one that's busy, and I can fix his.
080:46:45 Anders (onboard): Yes.
080:46:47 Anders (onboard): Yes, it - it'll take a good while.
080:46:53 Anders (onboard): It's up at 85 percent. Right now, it's 47.
080:46:59 Lovell (onboard): Now much film do we have left over, Bill?
080:47:02 Anders (onboard): Well, I'll tell you, Jim, these windows are so bad, you can just take pictures - say one - We need - we need - Don't get into that interior - interior's for inside stuff; and we need one - 16 millimeter for the convergent stereo, and - oh, about a half of one for that image-motion compensation which - kind of a low-priority thing.
080:47:33 Lovell (onboard): Do you do you want Verb 83? Did you look for...
080:47:40 Anders (onboard): Yes, it's the [garble] isn't all that bad, but we could try - we are allowed to yaw. We could try Verb 83 for drill.
080:47:59 Lovell (onboard): Okay, I'd better get out the books and...
080:48:00 Anders (onboard): This one says 92; I'll crank it around a little bit.
080:49:09 Lovell (onboard): Okay, how's our RCS doing?
080:49:11 Anders (onboard): Good.
080:49:12 Lovell (onboard): Let's see if...
080:49:14 Anders (onboard): Well, it hasn't changed since we started. See, it's still about - 67 percent.
080:49:28 Anders (onboard): SPS is holding steady.
080:49:32 Anders (onboard): Did you cycle through the EPS, Jim? [Garble]...
080:49:38 Lovell (onboard): No, I haven't done that, yet. Okay, and don't forget...

This is Apollo Control, Houston at 80 hours, 57 minutes. We're - we've just lost signal with the spacecraft, we have several minutes of conversation to play out for you, but before we get to that I want to mention one or two things. I don't think we've made mention of the fact today that we have finally, after six revolutions, gotten used to watching the spacecraft go from the right side of our front wall map to the left, just as it is proceeding around the Moon in a retrograde orbit. This, after all these years of watching the spacecraft move from the left side of the wall map to the right, it's quite a transformation in just one brief day. Another point regarding the windows; obviously that this has to be the worst system we've turned up with on this flight, and we've been talking to several experts about it here. This particular condition that we're seeing, the fogging on the hatch window and on - to a considerable degree - and on windows one and five, is similar to a condition that existed on spacecraft 101, commonly known as Apollo 7. The situation has, within very recent days, been - if not duplicated very closely - approximated in tests within the Spacecraft Industrial Government Complex. The tests have shown that the material used in the window caulking, if you will; the substance around the window that provides the trough in which the three pane windows ride; it has been demonstrated that some outgassing occurs with the particular treated - the particular kind of rubbery material being used in these windows joints, that is the window joints in [windows] 1, 3, and 5. In the rendezvous windows, windows 2 and 4, a different material treated under different conditions is being used and apparently it's quite successful. Some changes will be made on the next spacecraft. And that represents about every - all the information we have on that particular area.
One other announcement, we presently plan no press conference this afternoon, I repeat no press conference at our change of shift because we really see no new information to offer. You've heard the bulk of the conversation today and I think it's all been very straightforward. And in view of the extraordinarily long hours that many of us have been in the control center, we would like to bypass the afternoon press conference which would have occurred about 6 o'clock, and continue to observe the activities through the evening hours, and top off the evening with a Trans-Earth Injection some time around midnight Houston time. So I say again, we presently plan no press conference at the change of this shift, which will occur around 6 pm tonight, and continue right ahead with as full coverage we can provide you, and take care of any questions you might want to relay to our news center. Here now is the tape that finished up the sixth rev.
