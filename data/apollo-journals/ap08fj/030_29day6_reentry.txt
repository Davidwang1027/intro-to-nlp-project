Apollo Control, Houston here; 146 hours, 26 minutes. We've had no additional conversation since our last report from the crew. Apparently they're all settled down in their couches and waiting for the re-entry. The next major event will be the Command/Service Module separation which should occur about 5 minutes from now. The Capsule Communicator's just been advised to tell the crew we are Go for that event. This, by the way, will be the fourth, this is the fourth manned flight to be returned to the Pacific area. And, coincidentally, all of the 8 series, Mercury 8, Gemini 8, and now Apollo 8 were brought back to the Pacific area. In addition, Mercury 9 landed off Hawaii. Here's some conversation; Ken Mattingly, our CapCom is talking to Bill Anders.
The following two utterances from Bill are not present on the air/ground audio recording.
146:26:20 Anders: Houston, this is Apollo 8. We're Go for Pyro Arm. [Long pause.]
146:26:37 Anders: Houston, Apollo 8. Do you read?

146:26:54 Lovell: Houston, Apollo 8. Confirm Go for Pyro Arm.
146:26:57 Mattingly: Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. You're Go for Pyro Arm. [Long pause.]
146:27:13 Mattingly: Apollo 8, Apollo 8. You're Go for Pyro Arm. Everything's looking good.
146:27:18 Anders: Roger. Everything's looking good here, Ken.

Recovery is advising the Flight Director of their good status, saying he has good weather out there. They're on station. The route of flight, in case you're not looking at a map, will be over northeast China, Peking, and over Tokyo, then we start a southeastern slant. The ship Redstone is parked at 24° north, 169° east. And the next listening point will be the ship Huntsville, tracking the ship at 172 west, 12° north, and the landing point just a few hundred miles southeast of there at 165 west, approximately 8 north. That point, by the way, is just 600 miles northwest of Christmas Island, which I'm sure has been noted.

146:29:10 Mattingly: Apollo 8, Apollo 8. It appears that your primary evaporator may have dried out. If you get a chance, go ahead and give it a try to reservice. Over.

The crew has been advised that their primary evaporator has dried out, a fact that I'm sure they couldn't care less about. They're about to say goodbye to that entire system in the Service Module in about two minutes.
In fact, the primary and secondary evaporators are located in the Command Module and are the only means of cooling the electronics after separation from the Service Module. Therefore, they remain a concern.

And the spacecraft is now - we see our systems here show that they have gone to ring 2; the Reaction Control System. The system looks quite good, it's operational at 200 pounds of propellant available in that system. It is a redundant system. A few of the events, as we plan to clock them here: the point of - the 400,000 foot point, which is that point when many of our events begin to happen, we call it, the area of reaching some little small amount of atmosphere, is to occur at 146 hours, 46 minutes. The blackout period should begin about 25 seconds later. The maximum heating point would be 146 hours, 47 minutes; and which should occur at roughly 200,000 feet. And at this point, the roller-coaster type ride that the spacecraft will take will bend slightly upward for approximately 40,000, 50,000 feet, and then level off and begin its last plunge back. But as it hits the first breaking point at 180,000 feet, the max g force will be felt by the crew, of 6.8 g's. A second g spike of 4.2 will be noted about 4 or 5 minutes later. The total blackout we're predicting this morning is on the order of 3 minutes, but since we have very little experience re-entering at these velocities, we must caution you, those are only estimates.
146:32:51 Mattingly: Apollo 8, Apollo 8. Your secondary loop looks good.
146:32:56 Lovell: Roger, Houston.

The Flight Director has confirmed separation - separation of the Command Module and the Service Module. We've been looking at data on the Command Module alone and all the values look quite good. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
Splashdown is about 25 minutes away.
The following audio file gives a combined record of transmissions from various sources from this point in the mission through to splashdown. The PAO commentator is in the left channel, while the air-to-ground and onboard conversations are combined in the right. Although listening in this manner can seem chaotic, it does give a good real-time sense of how quickly things happen at the end of the mission. This clip ends with the barely audible call from Recovery 3 (helo) "Command Module is in the water!"

146:36:53 Anders (onboard): ROT Control Power Direct, both, Main A/Main B.
146:36:55 Lovell (onboard): Tape Recorder, you got that?
146:36:56 Anders (onboard): Roger. Horizon check.
146:36:58 Lovell (onboard): He's doing that now.
146:37:00 Anders (onboard): Pitch needle error goes toward zero approaching zero at 0.5g time.
146:37:03 Borman (onboard): Okay.
146:37:04 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
146:37:05 Anders (onboard): Don't forget Manual Attitude, three, to Rate Command.
146:37:07 Lovell (onboard): ... Command, that's right.
146:37:08 Borman (onboard): Yes. Okay, but tell me that later, okay?
146:37:09 Anders (onboard): Yes, right. Don't forget it.
146:37:10 Lovell (onboard): You've got to do it in checklist... as we go.
146:37:11 Borman (onboard): I've got to have that; just tell me later, okay?
146:37:13 Lovell (onboard): We're stopped right there.
146:37:14 Borman (onboard): How's your evaporator?
146:37:15 Anders (onboard): It's - it seems to be hanging in there, but it's awfully low steam pressure. I'll - I'll manually feed it if I have to.
146:37:20 Borman (onboard): Alright.
146:37:28 Borman (onboard): See where this baby wants me to fly? The pitch is way up.
146:37:33 Lovell (onboard): See if [garble] of the alpha meter.
146:37:35 Borman (onboard): Now, as we come close to the horizon we're going to [garble].
146:37:38 Lovell (onboard): [Garble].
146:37:40 Borman (onboard): As we come closer to the...
146:37:44 Lovell (onboard): Yes. This thing came in long before. I thought it was going to at 45 degrees, where 152 is the nominal entry attitude.
146:37:54 Borman (onboard): Boy, it did come in wrong, didn't it?
146:37:59 Lovell (onboard): Sure. See, I was waiting for that thing to come in. I didn't think it would come in until about 200 degrees.
146:38:01 Borman (onboard): How come we came in so soon?
146:38:03 Lovell (onboard): I don't know.
146:38:07 Anders (onboard): Okay, evaporator's Go.
146:38:08 Lovell (onboard): Good.
146:38:10 Anders (onboard): I'm pretty sure.
146:38:12 Borman (onboard): I keep wanting to yaw off the right here; It must be because we're boiling.
146:38:17 Anders (onboard): We're really boiling.
146:38:22 Lovell (onboard): Okay, all - We're standing by now - You've got Manual Attitude, three, Rate Command when you get time. That's - We're down to there, and we are going to have a CMC Go or No-Go check. We've got two things to do: either the DAP's No-Go, which we'll find out when he flies it; If the CMC is No-Go, he'll fly the EMS.
146:38:36 Anders (onboard): You got the 0.05g and EMS Roll, On.
146:38:41 Borman (onboard): And that's an 0.05 change.
146:34:43 Lovell (onboard): That's right.
146:38:44 Anders (onboard): Okay, it looks like we got the evaporator.
146:38:53 Lovell (onboard): How's that needle doing?
146:38:56 Borman (onboard): Fine.
146:38:58 Lovell (onboard): The horizon hard to find?
146:38:59 Borman (onboard): No.
146:39:13 Borman (onboard): I wish you'd keep checking my yaw for me there, will you?
146:39:15 Lovell (onboard): I will. You're a little bit left now, or a little right - Go left, just a little bit.

Apollo Control, Houston here. We continue to look good on all sources. We - in 11 minutes from now, we will be at the 400,000-foot mark and the velocity of the crew at this point will be 36,220 feet per second [11,040 m/s], we estimate. That converts to 24,530 [statute] miles per hour, which is - which is nearly, it's more than 500 miles per hour faster than the crew was moving only 2½ days ago [means 6 days] at Translunar Injection. Their burnout speed at that point 180 miles above the Earth was 35,556 feet per second [10,837 m/s] or 24,080 miles per hour. Today, as we come back to that point, after all the maneuvering and all of the burning at 180 miles above the Earth, we will see a velocity of 35,644 feet per second [10,864 m/s] and still building up down to this value at 400,000 feet [121.92 km]. These are estimates and will be refined based on post-flight data, but they're good estimates at this point. All in all a very quiet re-entry up to this point. This is Apollo Control, Houston. We'll continue to monitor.

146:39:20 Mattingly: Apollo 8, Houston. Looking good; both primary and secondary loops look good. [Long pause.]
146:39:24 Anders (onboard): I think you're slightly rolled - Roll right. Frank.
146:39:28 Borman (onboard): I don't care about the rolls.
146:39:31 Borman (onboard): Okay. We don't need any of that, Houston.
146:39:46 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
146:39:50 Lovell (onboard): Keep the horizon right there.
146:39:52 Mattingly: Apollo 8, through the Redstone. You're looking good; both primary and secondary loops are holding good. [Long pause.]
146:40:00 Anders (onboard): Roger; looks like we got it reserviced.
146:40:07 Anders (onboard): And we've got a good horizon.
146:40:11 Anders (onboard): Looks like you are yawing to the left or something.
146:40:13 Borman (onboard): No.
146:40:14 Lovell (onboard): He's just about on, Bill.
146:40:15 Borman (onboard): I've got two separate sources in here that tell me my yaw's zero don't I? Actually, I can just fly those needles, now.
146:40:26 Mattingly: Apollo 8, Apollo 8, through Redstone. Over.

And this is Apollo Control here. We've put in a call through the Redstone.
146:40:32 Borman: Go ahead, Houston. It's Apollo 8.
146:40:34 Mattingly: Rog. Read you loud and clear. You're looking good.
146:40:39 Borman: Roger.
Long comm break.
And they were advised by Ken Mattingly that they were looking good, which they certainly are. The cabin pressure is 4.9 pounds per square inch, the cabin temperature is down a little bit, purposely, so it's down to 61. Most of the flight it ran between 77 and 78 degrees. We're estimating that the crew are still head down and tracking the horizon visually out their rendezvous - out the windows, any handy window, and letting the G&N system do its work. At 146 hours, 41 minutes; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
146:40:44 Borman (onboard): The control harmony is not too good in this. You get a lot more pitch than you do yaw and roll.
146:40:49 Anders (onboard): Hey there, you're yawing my way.
146:40:50 Borman (onboard): Look who's coming there, would you?
146:40:52 Anders (onboard): Yes.
146:40:53 Borman (onboard): You see it?
146:40:54 Anders (onboard): Yes.
146:40:55 Borman (onboard): Just like they promised.
146:40:56 Lovell (onboard): What?
146:40:57 Borman (onboard): (LMP?) The Moon.
146:40:58 Lovell (onboard): Oh.
146:40:59 Borman (onboard): At 6 minutes before, just like it says.
146:41:01 Lovell (onboard): Okay. RRT is 46:13, we're 41:03.
146:41:06 Anders (onboard): Are you still Min Imp, Frank?
146:41:07 Borman (onboard): Yes.
146:41:08 Lovell (onboard): That's right.
146:41:09 Anders (onboard): Okay.
146:41:11 Lovell (onboard): That's where we stop, Man Attitude, three, Rate Command.
146:41:21 Borman (onboard): Well, I'm going to give her to the DAP anyway when we get down.
146:41:24 Lovell (onboard): As soon as you see that needle starts going off the peg, huh?
146:41:26 Borman (onboard): Yes.
146:41:27 Lovell (onboard): Yes, I would, too. Better see what she does.
146:41:36 Borman (onboard): Make sure the BMAG's are not changed - they're not. It'll be [garble] If they are.
146:41:48 Borman (onboard): Well, men, we're getting close.
146:41:54 Anders (onboard): There's no turning back now.
146:41:57 Lovell (onboard): Old mother Earth has us.
146:42:00 Anders (onboard): We may end up losing our horizon here when that Moon goes down.
146:42:05 Lovell (onboard): That's probably what makes your horizon so good is the Moon background - before it rose.
146:42:11 Anders (onboard): I wonder if [sounds like Dimlight Dunkleman] would like me to do a little airglow photography right now?
In the Apollo 15 Lunar Surface Journal, Dave Scott mentions an astronomer who helped to teach the Apollo crews about the night skies. He said, "We had an astronomer named Dunkleman, 'Dim-Light' Dunkleman."
146:42:13 Borman (onboard): Yes.
146:42:20 Borman (onboard): Check - double check both balls for me, Jim, so...
146:42:22 Lovell (onboard): Yes, you're okay.
146:42:24 Borman (onboard): We're not just reading one ball, okay?
146:42:25 Lovell (onboard): Yes, this ball's agreeing with that one.
146:42:30 Lovell (onboard): Well, we're 42:30...
146:42:31 Borman (onboard): Check your other (RCS) ring, just for sure, Jim.
146:42:39 Borman (onboard): There goes a washer; can you grab it?
146:42:41 Lovell (onboard): Yes, I've been trying to get that washer...
146:42:42 Borman (onboard): ...Well, It a too late now.
146:42:43 Lovell (onboard): Well 42:02 and 46:13. We're at 42:47, 46:32
146:42:49 Borman (onboard): We're getting close to 0.05g, too.
146:43:09 Borman (onboard): Now's the - how high's the voltage?
146:43:11 Anders (onboard): Voltage is great; 28 volts.
146:43:15 Borman (onboard): Okay.
146:43:22 Lovell (onboard): Okay, 152 will be the entry PAD. Pitch?
146:43:27 Anders (onboard): Okay. You're about to lose your Moon.
146:43:32 Lovell (onboard): Okay, your yaw's looking good.
146:43:37 Anders (onboard): Got a lot of lightning down there, so you - you'll probably have something.
146:43:42 Borman (onboard): I got the old - Bill never saw that.
146:10:44 Anders (onboard): What is that?
146:43:45 Borman (onboard): Oh, did you notice? That's the haze level.
146:43:47 Anders (onboard): Airglow?
146:43:48 Borman (onboard): Airglow.
146:43:49 Borman (onboard): Good old airglow is what's...
146:43:51 Anders (onboard): I'll look at the airglow next time.
146:43:53 Lovell (onboard): That's right, you've never seen the airglow. Take a look at it.
146:43:59 Borman (onboard): You can't get your [astronaut] pin without seeing the airglow.
146:44:00 Lovell (onboard): That's right.
146:44:01 Anders (onboard): I see it! I see it! [Laughter.]
146:44:04 Anders (onboard): Let's see, is this where I'm supposed to ask how many g's, Lovell?
146:44:07 Lovell (onboard): That's right [laughter], you ask how many g's.
146:44:09 Borman (onboard): How are we doing?
146:44:10 Anders (onboard): We're doing good over here.
146:44:11 Lovell (onboard): Okay in the middle.
146:44:13 Lovell (onboard): 44:13; We're 2 minutes away from RRT.
146:44:30 Borman (onboard): Now that horizon's getting harder to find.
146:44:38 Lovell (onboard): You're within 30 degrees of - of the attitude.
146:44:41 Borman (onboard): How do you know?
146:44:42 Lovell (onboard): Well, 152 is it, and you're coming up on it now.
146:44:45 Anders (onboard): It's getting a, little hazy out here; does that mean anything - every time you fire a thruster.
146:44:50 Borman (onboard): We're starting to get some reflection off the Earth, I guess.
146:45:08 Anders (onboard): Did anybody ever see the service module?
146:45:10 Borman (onboard): Yes - No, excuse me.
146:45:12 Lovell (onboard): Okay, your needle's coming up.
146:45:14 Borman (onboard): Okay.

146:45:15 Mattingly: Apollo 8, Houston. One minute to RRT.
146:45:20 Borman: Roger.
Borman (onboard): Rate Command.
Long comm break.
146:45:19 Lovell (onboard): Ready; 1, 2, 3, Rate Command
146:45:21 Borman (onboard): Rate Command
146:45:22 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
146:45:24 Lovell (onboard): The CMC in Auto?
146:45:25 Borman (onboard): I'm going there now, but - Now the CMC has got us.
146:55:29 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
146:16:32 Anders (onboard): Okay, the pitch error is approaching zero?
146:45:35 Lovell (onboard): Is the DAP Go?
146:45:36 Borman (onboard): DAP seems to be going.
146:45:37 Anders (onboard): Okay - -
146:45:38 Borman (onboard): Did you check out the horizon?
146:45:40 Anders (onboard): Manual Attitude, three, Rate Command?
146:45:41 Borman (onboard): Rate Command.
146:45:42 Lovell (onboard): You've got the checklist again, Bill.
146:45:43 Anders (onboard): You got it?
146:45:44 Borman (onboard): Yes.
146:45:45 Lovell (onboard): Yes.
146:45:46 Anders (onboard): BMAG, three, RATE 2.
146:45:47 Borman (onboard): RATE 2.
146:45:48 Anders (onboard): CMC in Auto.
146:45:49 Borman (onboard): CMC in Auto; Well, you don't need Auto, but I'll put it there and make everybody happy.
146:45:54 Lovell (onboard): Okay, 0.05g is at 46:41...
146:45:57 Anders (onboard): You call 0.05g, Jim.
146:45:58 Lovell (onboard): I'll call 0.05 - I'll tell you when the g starts going...
146:46:00 Borman (onboard): I've got to start this thing automatic - manually, if you don't give it to me, Jim.
146:46:02 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
146:46:03 Borman (onboard): ...so be sure you call it.
146:46:05 Lovell (onboard): At 0.05g time, right?
146:46:07 Borman (onboard): Yes. God, it is hazy out there, isn't it? That's a different lighting effect. I think.
146:46:14 Anders (onboard): That's sunrise.
146:46:16 Borman (onboard): Huh?
146:46:17 Lovell (onboard): Yes, that's the Sun...
146:46:18 Anders (onboard): Oh, here we go.
146:46:19 Lovell (onboard): 146:46:20; we should have 0.05g's.
146:46:22 Borman (onboard): That's the airglow we are starting to get; that's what it is, gentlemen.
146:46:25 Lovell (onboard): Yes.
146:46:26 Lovell (onboard): One - okay, we got the...
146:46:28 Borman (onboard): God damn, this is going to be a real ride; hang on.
146:46:29 Lovell (onboard): [Garble].
146:46:30 Borman (onboard): I've never seen it this bright before.
146:46:32 Lovell (onboard): Yes. Like you were going...
146:46:33 Borman (onboard): You got 0.05g yet?
146:46:35 Lovell (onboard): ...0.02, stand by; 38, 39, 40, 41
146:46:41 Lovell (onboard): 0.05g!
146:46:42 Borman (onboard): 0.05g!
146:46:43 Anders (onboard): Okay, we got it!
146:46:44 Lovell (onboard): Put the EMS, On.
146:46:45 Borman (onboard): Hang on!
146:46:46 Anders (onboard): 0.05g switch, On.
146:46:47 Lovell (onboard): 0.05g Roll to EMS.
At the point that 0.05g is sensed, the EMS scroll is activated. The scroll moves from right to left and is driven by the velocity value as sensed by the EMS's own accelerometer. Therefore the horizontal axis of the scroll is calibrated in feet per second. Its vertical axis is g-force. Thus, as they slow, they can monitor how their spacecraft is decelerating in relation to their decreasing velocity.
The Apollo 8 EMS scroll including the trace, kindly provided by Dr. Roger Clark.
Points to note are the initial fast rise in their deceleration on the left. This then backs off to a more or less constant g-force through most of the remaining deceleration. The features on the left, at 33.5 and 34.7, are system glitches. The right-hand side has the deployment of the parachutes.
146:46:48 Borman (onboard): Right. Okay, gang.
146:46:53 Lovell (onboard): They're building up.
146:46:59 Borman (onboard): Call out the g's.
146:47:03 Lovell (onboard): We're 1 g.
146:47:19 Lovell (onboard): Ohhh!
146:47:21 Borman (onboard): Okay
146:47:23 Lovell (onboard): 5!
146:47:41 Lovell (onboard): 6!
146:47:53 Lovell (onboard): 4!
146:48:01 Lovell (onboard): She's doing a great job.
146:48:06 Lovell (onboard): Vcircular at 48:23.
146:48:24 Borman (onboard): Vcircular
146:48:26 Anders (onboard): Cabin temperature is still holding real good.
146:48:33 Lovell (onboard): VI's still high. Okay, we're [Program] 67.

And this is Apollo Control, Houston; 146 hours, 45 minutes. And we're very nearly at that 400,000-foot point. We just gave the crew a call and here's how it sounded: [brief communication with the spacecraft]. In the course of this blackout period, which we'll be into very shortly here, the comm control will be handed over from the Redstone to the Huntsville, and we have lost signal, our network controller says we lost signal at 146:46 minutes and with very nearly 46 seconds. And our estimate is that this blacked-out period will - will continue - oh, let's see, three minutes. And right about now the crew should be getting the spike, the g spike that they'll see, just under 7 gs. We would estimate they're down to the 180,000-foot point, flattening out and actually beginning to ascend slightly. They should be - their heat rate will dramatically recede but they'll still maintain a large heat load, nearly 5,000 degrees [Fahrenheit, about 2,700°C] out on the leading edge of the heatshield. Flight Director notes that he hears some keying coming, as in Morse code keying and he's wondering as to the source of it. 146 hours, 48 minutes.
And our curves put the spacecraft down about 35 to 36 miles above the Earth and elevating slightly, perhaps up to 40.
146:48:44 Borman: Good point, too. [Long pause.]
146:49:07 Anders (onboard): Quite a ride, huh?
146:49:13 Borman (onboard): Damndest thing I ever saw.

146:49:15 Mattingly: Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. [Long pause.]
146:49:16 Borman (onboard): Gemini was never like that, was it, Jim?
146:49:19 Lovell (onboard): No, it was a little faster than this one.
146:49:27 Anders (onboard): I assure you I've never seen anything like it.
146:49:32 Anders (onboard): Cabin temperature's holding real good - up 1 degree.
146:49:43 Anders (onboard): Primary evaporator's crapped out; secondary's still working.
146:49:43 Mattingly: Apollo 8, Houston through Huntsville. Over.
146:49:51 Lovell (onboard): Coming up at 2g's.
146:49:56 Anders (onboard): Temperature's coming up in the primary loop okay.
146:50:05 Comm tech (Huntsville): Houston, Huntsville. We have not established contact with the spacecraft at this time.
146:50:10 Borman (onboard): Nice job there, gang.
146:50:15 Mattingly: Roger. Thank you, Huntsville.
146:50:16 Lovell (onboard): Drogues at - You got then there? 8:16.
146:50:23 Borman (onboard): That's 58:16?
146:50:27 Borman (onboard): No, that's not right. 54 ...right.
146:50:46 Anders (onboard): It's a real glow. I can see our gegenschein.
146:50:51 Borman (onboard): Second pulse coming up.
146:50:55 SC (onboard): [Cough.]
146:50:58 Comm tech (Huntsville): Huntsville, AOS through S-band. [Pause.] Houston, Huntsville. Stand by. No contact.
146:51:08 Anders (onboard): How much will this one go up, do you think?
146:51:11 Lovell (onboard): 3!
146:51:11 Mattingly: Roger.
Comm break.
Ken Mattingly just put in a call and just frankly labeled it a radio check. He's gotten no response as yet.
And Ken tries a second call through the Huntsville. Our estimates say that the crew, along about now should be emerging. The Huntsville advises they have not established contact with the spacecraft at this time. About three and a half minutes since we went into the blacked-out area. And now the Huntsville is handing over communication checks - communication authority to one of the range aircraft, they call them AIRA. And the Huntsville - the Huntsville says they have acquired an S-band signal, at 51 minutes, 4 seconds; and they immediately called back and said no contact, they negate that first announcement.
146:51:29 Lovell (onboard): Okay, we should have comm.
146:51:32 Mattingly: Apollo 8, Apollo 8, this is Houston through ARIA.
146:51:32 Borman (onboard): Give them a call.
146:51:34 Lovell (onboard): Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
146:51:36 Unknown speaker, may be Lovell's call: [Garble.]
146:51:39 Mattingly: Say again, 8. [Pause.]
146:51:47 Borman: Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
146:51:50 Mattingly: Go ahead, Apollo 8. Read you broken and loud.
146:51:51 Borman: Roger; this is a real fireball. It's looking good.
146:51:53 Borman (onboard): Come on, John Glenn.
146:51:56 Mattingly: Outstanding! [Long pause.]
146:52:06 Borman (onboard): Don't let me forget those - boost entry.
146:52:09 Anders (onboard): Roger; I got you.
146:52:10 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
146:52:11 Borman (onboard): It's almost all over but the shouting now, men.
One of the recovery helicopters reported seeing something, but those kind of reports at these critical moments aren't unusual. Ken Mattingly puts in another call and there's Jim Lovell! He says, 'We're looking good.' I can't tell whether it's Borman or Lovell. Let's try to cut it in.
146:52:15 Borman: We're in real good shape, Houston.
146:52:17 Mattingly: Real fine. [Long pause.]
146:52:18 Lovell (onboard): I think he's going to take Paul Haney's job. [Laughter.]
Paul Haney is the Public Affairs Officer with the deeply mellow and sonorous voice. Perhaps Jim is referring to Ken's calm tone when reporting "Real fine". Bill's retort seems to bear that out.
146:52:20 Anders (onboard): [Laughter.] My mother was worried.
Now one of the range ships is reporting a radar contact. The first communication was extremely broken up, but the two words that did come through were 'looking good'. Another one of the flight controllers here in the control center heard the crew mention, something like 'a real fire ball'.
146:52:25 Anders (onboard): A little smell in here.
146:52:27 Anders (onboard): Don't go to boost entry yet.
146:52:31 Mattingly: Apollo 8, Houston. Yorktown has radar on you.
Comm break.
146:52:42 Borman (onboard): Alright, I'm in boost entry.
146:52:43 Anders (onboard): Okay.
146:52:44 Borman (onboard): How's it look...
146:52:45 Anders (onboard): Looking good.
146:52:47 Borman (onboard): Is it holding? Cabin pressure?
146:52:50 Anders (onboard): Yes, it's holding.
146:52:51 Borman (onboard): Alright. Watch your altimeter, that's going to come up in a hurry here.
146:52:55 Lovell (onboard): Okay
146:52:56 Anders (onboard): I'll - I'll give you warning on the steam pressure, if I can see it.
146:53:00 Borman (onboard): 2 g's.
146:53:02 Lovell (onboard): 54:29 should be...
146:53:05 Borman (onboard): Looks like we're overshooting, according to the EMS.
146:53:07 Anders (onboard): Yes.
146:53:08 Borman (onboard): Okay.
146:53:10 Lovell (onboard): 53.
146:53:17 Borman (onboard) Got anything yet, Bill?
146:53:19 Anders (onboard): Yeah, I'm getting steam pressure. Okay.
146:53:22 Lovell (onboard): 54:29.
146:53:23 Anders (onboard): We got steam pressure.
146:53:24 Borman (onboard): We do?
146:53:25 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
146:53:26 Anders (onboard): Make sure your heels are locked.
146:53:27 Borman (onboard): We got a - we got a minute to drogues.
146:53:30 Anders (onboard): Okay, you're in boost entry?
146:53:31 Borman (onboard): Yep.
146:53:33 Anders (onboard): Okay, anything on the altimeter, yet?
146:53:36 Borman (onboard): Not yet.
146:53:37 Anders (onboard): Okay, we've got 15 seconds from where - from 90K [27,500 metres].
146:53:40 Borman (onboard): Okay.
146:53:48 Anders (onboard): Okay.
146:53:49 Borman (onboard): There she comes.
146:53:50 Lovell (onboard): Okay, she's starting to come.
146:53:52 Anders (onboard): 30 seconds from 90K [27,500 metres].
We estimate here we're about one minute to drogue deploy. Drogue chutes out at 23,000 feet, and the time plot says 146 hours, 54 minutes. The Yorktown is reporting and confirming a radar contact, the bearing is being passed to the recovery room, here in Houston.
146:53:57 Mattingly: Apollo 8, Houston.
146:53:59 Borman: Stand by, Houston.
146:54:01 Mattingly: If you get a chance, we'd like to have your DSKY readings before drogues.
146:54:04 Borman: Stand by.
Borman (onboard): Can you give him a DSKY reading?
146:54:05 Anders (onboard): Before drogues?
146:54:08 Lovell: Roger. DSKY's reading plus four balls 7, plus two balls 812, minus 16522.
That's Jim Lovell.
Comm break.
146:54:15 Lovell (onboard): 40K [12,200 metres].
146:54:16 Lovell (onboard): Coming up on 40K. You should be at 40K now.
146:54:19 Lovell (onboard): We're at 40K.
146:54:20 Borman (onboard): We are.
146:54:21 Anders (onboard): Okay, my call 30K [9,150 metres].
146:54:23 Borman (onboard): I will.
146:54:30 Borman (onboard): 30K [9,150 metres].
146:54:31 Anders (onboard): ELS.
146:54:32 Borman (onboard): ELS Logic, On
146:54:33 Anders (onboard): Right.
146:54:34 Anders (onboard): ELS, Auto.
146:54:35 Borman (onboard): Auto.
146:54:38 Anders (onboard): Stand by for RCS disable. Stand by on the apex cover.
146:54:40 Borman (onboard): Right.
146:54:46 Borman (onboard): There goes the apex cover; there go the drogues.
146:54:53 Borman (onboard): Okay.
146:54:56 Lovell (onboard): 20,000 [6,100 metres].
The spacecraft is falling at about 10,000 feet/minute - an aircraft normally descends at about 500 feet/minute (3,000 metres/min versus 150 metres/min).
146:55:03 Anders (onboard): Cabin pressure's coming up.

Apollo Control, Houston here; at 146 hours, 55 minutes. According to our numbers we should have main chute deploy, we should have had it within the last minute. We've heard nothing but a lot of noise on the circuit for the last minute or so. It is understandable at these low level relays, everyone is passing it. And here comes something from Apollo 8: "Over" he said.
146:55:04 Lovell (onboard): 19,000 [5,800 metres].
146:55:08 Anders (onboard): Stand by for 10K [3,050 metres].
146:55:20 Anders (onboard): Should be approaching 10K soon.
146:55:22 Lovell (onboard): 15 [thousand feet. 4,600 metres].
146:55:25 Borman (onboard): Wonder what that was?
146:55:27 Anders (onboard): Nothing.
146:55:32 Anders (onboard): Should be approaching 10K [3,050 metres]. Standby with the mains in 1 second.
146:55:45 Borman (onboard): You see it?
146:55:46 Anders (onboard): Can't see it.
146:55:47 Borman (onboard): It should reef pretty soon. [Means unreef - the mains come out reefed, and unreef in two phases.]
146:55:48 Anders (onboard): Can't see a thing.
146:55:52 Anders (onboard): Okay, you got them?
146:55:55 Borman (onboard): Yes.
146:55:56 Anders (onboard): Float Bag, three, circuit breakers Closed.
146:55:58 Borman (onboard): Closed.
146:55:59 Anders (onboard): VHF antennas, recovery; VHF AM, simplex.
146:56:03 Anders (onboard): Beacons going On. Get your light On.
146:56:05 Borman (onboard): It's On.
146:56:06 Anders (onboard): you got your - you got it, Jim.
146:56:08 Lovell (onboard): Huh?
146:56:09 Anders (onboard): You got the call - give them a call.
146:56:10 Lovell (onboard): Okay.
146:56:13 Borman: This is Apollo 8. Over.
Long comm break.

The transmission from Apollo 8, no follow up. In a simulation yesterday we had extremely good communication from the recovery area and we see - we're hopeful that that situation will be duplicated today.
146:56:15 Borman (onboard): Okay, standing by for the (RCS) dump.
146:56:17 AB1: Apollo 8. Airboss 1. Go ahead.
146:56:19 Lovell (onboard): Roger, Air Force 1. We indicate 8,000 [2,440 metres]. We can't see the chutes, but we're going down very slow.
146:56:25 AB1: Roger, this is Airboss 1. You're sounding very good, very good. You have been reported on radar as, southwest of the ship about 25 [nautical] miles [46 km]. Go ahead.
146:56:37 Lovell (onboard): Roger. We are now indicating 7,000 [2,130 metres].
146:56:40 Borman (onboard): Ask him if he sees our beacon.
146:56:42 Lovell (onboard): Airboss, do you see our flashing beacon?
146:56:44 AB1: This is Airboss 1. Negative. Welcome home, gentlemen, and we'll have you aboard in no time. Go ahead.
146:56:50 Anders (onboard): Stand by for the dump, Frank.
146:56:52 Borman (onboard): Alright.
146 hours, 57 minutes; and according to our estimates, they should be hitting the water just about 147 hours even. If and when we get some intelligible comm, we'll come back up on the line. This is Apollo Control, Houston; standing by.
146:56:55 R3 This is Recovery 3. I have a flashing light, my 4 o'clock position, almost level.
146:57:03 AB1: Recovery 2, sever contact 260
146:57:04 Anders (onboard): Okay, ready for the dump, Frank?
146:57:05 Borman (onboard): Ready.
146:57:06 Anders (onboard): Cabin Pressure Relief valves, both, Closed.
146:57:07 Borman (onboard): Got that.
146:57:08 AB1: ...my position at...
146:57:09 Borman (onboard): Direct O2, Open.
146:57:10 AB1: ...09548.
146:57:11 Borman (onboard): Open.
146:57:12 Anders (onboard): CM RCS Logic, On.
146:57:13 Borman (onboard): On.
146:57:14 Anders (onboard): Command Module Propellant, Dump.
146:57:24 AB2: Recovery 2, Airboss 2. You are cleared to dispatch for your altitude over clouds. Over.
146:57:30 R2: Roger this Is Recovery 2. I see the chutes, I see the light almost directly over Yorktown, level with me at 4,000 feet [1,220 metres] precisely.
146:57:40 Borman (onboard): Stand by. Stand by for Earth landing!
146:57:44 AB1 Yorktown, Airboss I - received a message that he sees the chutes, sees the flashing light almost over Yorktown, descending 4,000 [garble] very, very [garble] Out.
146:58:04 Yorktown: All aircraft, this is Yorktown - have capsule in sight. Out.

And this is Apollo Control, Houston; 146 hours, 58 minutes. Recovery II, within the last minute, has reported they have a flashing light in sight, and they followed that with, 'We have voice contact with the crew.' I repeat, they said, 'We have voice contact with the crew.' At 146 hours, 58 minutes; we're going to try to patch that conversation into our consoles here. Right now, we've not heard it.
146:58:15 Anders (onboard): Okay! Purge. Purge it.
146:58:20 Borman (onboard): We're purging.
146:58:22 Anders (onboard): Purge complete?
The lookout - a lookout on the Yorktown now reports a visual sighting. They must be close at hand. The helicopter nearest them is piloted by Lt. Kenneth Owen of Pensacola, Florida. There are three swimmers in that helicopter. And the Flight Director has advised us to bring up a special circuit, which we hope will bring us the - any communication that develops out there.
146:58:24 AB1: Yorktown, this is Airboss 1. We consider recovery splashdown in your area. Take control recovery helos and vector them.
146:58:33 Anders (onboard): Floodlights to Postlanding.
146:58:34 Yorktown : This is Yorktown. Roger, out.
146:58:35 Anders (onboard): Cabin Pressure Relief valves, [garble].
146:58:37 R3 This is Recovery 3. Have lost sight of visual light
146:58:40 AB1: [Garble]. Yorktown.
146:58:44 Anders (onboard): Dump - purge the cabin at 3,000 feet [900 metres].
146:58:46 AB2 Recovery 2, 'boss 2. You're 22 out.
146:58:49 Anders (onboard): CM RCS propellant, both. Off.
146:58:50 AB2 Recovery 2. Roger. Passing 1,500 feet [450 metres], descending
146:58:53 Anders (onboard): Rotational Control Power Direct, Off.
146:58:55 Borman (onboard): Direct, Off
146:58:56 Yorktown: This is Yorktown. Affirmative, we do have him in - capsule in sight. Out.
146:59:00 Anders (onboard): Turn him down. Christ, we can't get anything done.
146:59:02 Borman (onboard): Alright, Direct is Off.
146:59:03 R2: ... is Recovery 2. Passing 1,000 feet [300 metres].
146:59:10 Borman (onboard): Okay...
146:59:11 Anders (onboard): What's that?
146:59:12 Borman (onboard): Cabin dump.
146:59:13 Anders (onboard): ...okay cabin dump. Okay, hold it.
146:59:16 Yorktown: Recovery 3, Yorktown. The capsule bears 147; 5,000 yards [4.6 km]. Yorktown, over.
146:59:23 Anders (onboard): [Garble] Off.
146:59:25 Borman (onboard): Alright, anything else we missed?
146:59:27 R3: Roger.
146:59:28 Anders (onboard): Negative; just stand by to release the mains.
146:59:30 Borman (onboard): Yes.
146:59:32 Anders (onboard): Stand by for the Main Bus ties.
146:59:34 Anders (onboard): Brace yourselves.
146:59:36 Borman (onboard): Well, wait; we've got 2,000 feet [600 metres], yet.
146:59:38 Lovell (onboard): I don't know if we have or not. They - reporting us as lower.
146:59:42 Anders (onboard): Oh, they were?
146:59:47 Borman (onboard): Who was worried about getting hot?
146:59:51 Anders (onboard): Only because I cooled you down.
146:59:53 Recovery 3: The spacecraft is down to 1,000 [300 metres].
146:59:58 R2 (from DSE): Recovery 2 is at level 1,000.
146:59:58 Yorktown: Re ready for code 3.
Comm break.
We've - We have an estimate here now, that the splashpoint may be as close as 5,000 yards [4.6 km] from the Yorktown. I repeat, 5,000 yards from the Yorktown. That's a very rough estimate. Now, we've gotten a second estimate of 5,000 yards from the Yorktown.
147:00:00 Lovell (onboard): 1,500 [450 metres].
147:00:01 AB1: Roger, 2. This is [garble] 3.
147:00:03 Borman (onboard): He called it 1,000. Maybe we better get these...
147:00:06 R2: Recovery 2, descending through cherubs 5.
147:00:04 Anders (onboard): Okay, Frank, you put them Close whenever you want. I'm turning the Main Bus ties Off now.
147:00:14 AB1: Recovery 1, this in Airboss...
147:01:40 Recovery 3: Yorktown, Rec 3. At this time, the Command Module is in the water. Over.
147:01:44 Yorktown: Roger. [Long pause.]
147:02:03 Yorktown: Recovery 3 reports splashdown time was 51 and 50 seconds, and rescue is underway.

This is Apollo Control, and if you've been listening to that circuit, you can tell why we can't be too sure of these events. It's a little ragged, but I have talked to the - to our Public Affairs Officer on the carrier. He assures me the spacecraft is 5,000 yards [4.6 km] away. And the general plan was to wait [for] a little more daylight before attempting a pickup. Intermittently we have been able to pick Borman's voice out of the noise and he seems to be carrying on the routine kinds of conversations that pilots use when they talk to each other in these kinds of situations. Very unruffled and we have no words there, no indication yet upon the attitude of the spacecraft, whether it is nose down, as was the case in Apollo 7, or up. Nearly everyone agrees it's only 5,000 yards away from the Yorktown, which we'll settle for right now at 147 hours, 5 minutes.

Apollo Control, Houston here; 147 hours, 8 minutes. We have had several things confirmed or reverified in the last few minutes. The crew condition number 1 is okay, and that came through loud and clear, just as I was talking, crew condition okay. We have thought we monitored several conversations between the crew and local helicopters, airplanes, and what not. We do have it back now, crew condition okay. The estimate from the Yorktown is the swimmers will wait approximately 20 to 25 minutes before deploying, this as per planned that as long as the crew is in satisfactory condition and in fact now we know that they're floating quite nicely in a stable 1 condition. I'm sure the chatting will continue over the next 20 to 25 minutes, but we're assured that everything is all right out there, This is Apollo Control, Houston.

Apollo Control, Houston here at 147 hours, 13 minutes. We have been advised by the recovery forces that recovery helicopter 3 is hovering over the spacecraft, 50 feet [15 metres] above it, and they estimate they are 6,000 yards [5.5 km] away from the Yorktown. The helicopter pilot is Commander Donald S. Jones of Madison, Wisconsin. When the swimmers get the signal to deploy, the first man in the water will be a Sonar Technician from Columbia, South Carolina, named Chester Coogin. Two other swimmers will follow him: Lt. J.G. Richard Flanagan of Oklahoma City, and Donald L. Schwab of Imperial Beach, California. And at 147 hours, 14 minutes; that's all the new information we have.

Apollo Control, Houston here. Two new reports. The inflation bags around the spacecraft are inflated and there have been reports, additional visual reports of course, of the flashing light seen from the Yorktown. And now illuminating the area is a helicopter with a big floodlight. So the entire area should be visible from the Yorktown. This is Apollo Control, Houston.

And this is Apollo Control, Houston. From the Yorktown, we have learned they're proceeding toward the spacecraft. They're now 4,500 yards away, 4,500 yards away. And that's our situation at 147 hours, 21 minutes.

And this is Apollo Control, Houston at 147 hours, 25 minutes. Apparently Frank Borman is making small talk with the crew of that helicopter out there. It was just relayed to us that he had, in chatting with the pilot, he had asked him if anyone had seen the spacecraft on main chute. And of course, there were several reports and this has become the subject of a continuing chat, the pilot of that helicopter is Commander Donald S. Jones. And, that's all the new information we have right now. At 147 hours, 26 minutes; this is Apollo Control, Houston.

Apollo Control, Houston here; and Ken Mattingly, our Capsule Communicator here, has just tried to call through an ARIA aircraft. While we try to establish the communication on that shot, we've been advised that the ship is now 3,800 yards away, and it's off the port side of the ship. The Yorktown has also advised us that in about in 14 minutes, they expect to deploy their first swimmers, about 14 minutes from now. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
And this is Apollo Control, Houston. Ken Mattingly's call just worked and we were kind of frightened at the volume and at the level the answer came back. Borman responded enthusiastically, 'Hello, there, Houston, how are you doing?. Here's the tape.
HTV: Primary rotoer, over. - This is primary rotoer, Apollo 8 has been advised to expect a call on 2968.
ARIA: aircraft, over. - Apollo 8 [garble]. [Garble] that is affirmative, over. Have you heard Apollo 8 [garble] over.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, that begins to make you understand the size of our communication program, it isn't a matter of just understanding every other word, it's a case of trying to understand a piece of every other conversation, but we're cheered up and we feel good, we know the crew is feeling fine and within a very few minutes, swimmers will be in the water and we should start the movement of the crew into the helicopters and over to the Yorktown. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
And this is Apollo Control, Houston; 147 hours, 34 minutes. And if anybody had any doubts about the condition of the crew, this little conversation which has been relayed to us, should clear up those doubts. In conversation with the helicopter commander, the crew commander, apparently, of the helicopter asked the crew what the Moon was made out of, whereupon Borman responded that it's not made out of green cheese at all, it's made out of American cheese, and, well, I think the crew's in pretty good shape. This is Apollo Control, Houston.

And this is Apollo Control, Houston. The report to us from the scene is that the first light of dawn is beginning to show in the east, and seeing streaks of light. The capsule's riding very nicely in relatively calm waters and just any minute from now we expect to hear a report that the swimmers are in the water. The conversations that have come back to us, except for an intermittent, occasionally hearing from the crew directly have been relayed from on the water to aircraft at approximately 25 - 30 thousand feet. There it's being repeated to another man in Honolulu at Hickam Air Force Base and at that point it's being relayed again, back here to Houston, at which point I am trying to relay the content of them to you. And now we get an estimate that the swimmers will be in the water in five minutes. He's preparing to put swimmers in the water in four to five minutes. This is Apollo Control, Houston.

And this is Apollo Control, Houston. We have a report from one of the on-scene helicopters that the spacecraft is still riding very nicely in the water and rotating at about 1 revolution per minute. I say again, spacecraft rotating at about 1 revolution per minute, which would be a little unusual. I don't know that we have ever seen that. This is Apollo Control, Houston.

This is Apollo Control, Houston; 147 hours, 42 minutes since we lifted off. From the communications out there, which are perhaps understandably bad at this time of day, this time of year, and under the circumstances we have plucked a breakfast order out and we managed to record it and we would like to play it for you.
Yorktown: This is the Yorktown and what would you prefer for your menu this morning, sir? Over.
SC Biscuit, steak, and eggs.
Yorktown: Roger out.
In case you missed it the order came back, 'We'll have steak and eggs, the same as we had before we left.' Now the helicopter's maneuvering in a position to drop swimmers and we expect that drop to start just any moment. Recovery 3 helo will deploy the swimmers. The helicopters continue to hover between 75 to 100 feet [30 metres], as low at 50 feet [15 metres], for certain inspection type passes. And Air Boss - Air Boss, Lt. Glen Byers of Evansville, Indiana, reports the first swimmer is in the water. And now we're advised that the swimmer has attached a sea anchor, and now the helicopter is moving in to deploy his two swimming colleagues. And then immediately one of the swimmers will plug in a phone and have a quick conversation with the crew.

And this is Apollo Control, Houston. We're advised that the sea anchor has been attached. The swimmers and the helicopter report they can see a light glowing through the windows from the spacecraft. The hatch, apparently not yet open. And the last measured distance we have between the Yorktown and the spacecraft is 2,900 yards [2.7 km]. This is Apollo Control, Houston.

Apollo Control, Houston here; 147 hours, 49 minutes since lift-off. Now all three swimmers from helicopter number 3 are in the water and they are clearly visible to the helicopter. They are working to affix the flotation collar still an added measure of flotation insurance, around the blunt end of the spacecraft. And immediately they will inflate the Mae West type device. And that's our situation.
Apollo Control, Houston here. In the last few minutes, we've deciphered from one relay communication from Jim Lovell that he could see the swimmers working around the spacecraft. We've had confirmation now that the inflation collar is fully inflated and secured. And we've had some queries regarding our splash point, and our best estimate is the aiming point. We have no reason to - we know that is was 5,000 yards [4.6 km] away from the Yorktown, the Yorktown is very, very close to the aiming point which was 165 degrees north, I say again 165 degrees north, - correction - 165 degrees west and 8 degrees, 8 minutes north. The collar, fully inflated. We still have no word as to when we might expect the crew open that hatch and come out and take a breath of Earth air. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
And this is Apollo Control, Houston. We've just been advised that the swimmers are standing on the inflation collar, awaiting the crew's pleasure. And we still have no estimate as to when the crew will emerge, but it's our guess that that'll come at just any - any minute right now. Now the swimmers are going through additional precautions to ensure that the inflation collar is very securely fastened to the spacecraft. Our elapsed time clock shows 148 hours. Just keep, with the line open for some word on that hatch opening.
Apollo Control here. We've just been advised that Recovery 3 is preparing to drop a large life-raft. The collar's been inspected and just any moment we expect to see - two life-rafts now have been dropped. Two life-rafts, and this probably signals a hatch opening just any moment.
And this is Apollo Control, Houston. Our extraordinary communication coincidences continue. The swimmers advise us that they cannot talk to the crew via an interphone, which is a hard line interphone connection, but they can talk with the crew from little hand radios. Still no word yet as to - as to when that hatch is going to open, but we're getting our first look at it here in this Control Center in color television which is an addition for this first flight. Both the camera - color camera and color monitors. And there's been some discussion that if that ship doesn't stop pitching and rolling we may have some seasickness cases here. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston. Now we've been advised that the recovery plan will be thusly: the crew will exit the spacecraft, get into a life raft, and then the hatch will be secured before we begin any spacecraft pickup or any pilot pickup. I thought I copied - stand by just one moment. Yeah, I'm sorry, no time estimate just yet as to when we can expect these events but with the light situation out there, we may be able to see them. They're estimating 1,500 yards [1.4 km] now from the spacecraft. We'll continue to monitor here. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston. We've just been advised that the hatch of Apollo 8, the hatch is now open. Just any moment we should have some reports on exiting crew members. At 11:04 Houston time we received the report the hatch was open. And even though our - and now we're getting the first astronaut, who's not identified but - by anything other than 'the first astronaut', is now exiting the spacecraft. He's now getting in a life raft. And now a second astronaut is leaving the spacecraft, and if we're following military tradition, the next astronaut should be Frank Borman, although since he's Air Force he may not follow the Navy tradition of the captain of the ship leaving 1ast. Now a second astronaut is sitting in the life raft. And now recovery advises the third astronaut, the final - and of course the usual jokes about 'And now the fourth astronaut!' but we've succeeded in suppressing the recovery room from advising us of any additional astronauts. All three astronauts are in the lift raft, the swimmers are positioned on the collar around the spacecraft. They are preparing to close and seal the hatch for the pickup which will come perhaps, an hour from now. And the order of the pilots leaving the Command Module was exactly opposite that that I intimated. Borman left first, the second, I believe - let's check it. Lovell second. Lovell went second and the junior member of the crew, Bill Anders, was last to leave.
And now we have had a third change on it. We're told that Jim Lovell may have been the first to leave the spacecraft. That makes good sense. Since he was in the center couch, it's entirely possible that he would leave first in order to let the other two out.
And this is Apollo Control, Houston. We have learned within the last couple of minutes that the crew has transferred to a new liferaft, for what reason we don't know, but we do know they're in a second liferaft now and the recovery helicopter is maneuvering to begin the pickup operation. On our recovery board here we see a message from Admiral McMannes, which reads, 'Please convey to our NASA friends my congratulations, re. this magnificent achievement, this reflected glory, has permitted all of us to stand taller in today's world; epic, historic, amazing, fantastic, heartwarming, and the next word I can't make out - unbelievable until it happened, hyphen, magnificent. It's signed Admiral McMannes and staff, who is the commander of the task force charged with this recovery effort. And we are advised that the first astronaut is in the helicopter, no more identification than that. Just first astronaut in a helicopter. Now the line is going down for the second astronaut. And the line is dangling and awaiting the pickup of the second man. Second astronaut's on his way up. A second astronaut in the sling and on his way.
And now we have had it confirmed; the second astronaut is in the recovery helicopter. And the line is going down for the third astronaut. Earlier we had given a position of the helicopter - of the carrier, only 1,500 yards [1.4 km] from the scene. That was incorrect, it should be corrected. The position at that time was 3,500 yards [3.2 km] from the scene and the carrier is making its swing now, preparatory to spacecraft pickup. All right, the third astronaut is in the sling and is being brought up into the helicopter. And the third astronaut steps into the helo at 11:14 Houston time. The helicopter pilot confirms that the helo door has been secured, all three men are aboard and they are preparing to embark on a short flight to the Yorktown. And as we can see on our television monitors, the helicopter is now proceeding toward the Yorktown.
And from the deck of the Yorktown, we learn that the helicopters have been advised the wind is from 355 degrees and it's blowing at 20 knots.
And this is Apollo Control here. Recovery 3 has been given permission to land first. Recovery 3 is bearing the pilots, we believe. And we can - we hear Recovery 2 being instructed to return to the helo at this time. Brisk, windy, situation out there. Navy helicopter number 66 prepares to touch down on the deck of the Yorktown. And touchdown at 20 minutes after the hour, 11:20 Central Standard Time. For those reporters not looking at a television monitor, the engines are being shutdown now. Two crew members have moved out to block them - block the wheels. And the television camera shifts to the door.
At this point, the audio feed shifts over to live commentary from the USS Yorktown, as the helicopter doors are about to open. Live TV converage over the CBS network covers the emergence of the astronauts and a brief series of speeches. Following this there comes a telephone interview with Susan Borman and a phone call from President Lyndon Johnson (and a contemporary TV commercial).

Apollo Control, Houston here. We had it confirmed through recovery, that apparently, at the request of Frank Borman, there was an electric razor aboard helicopter, and Frank Borman used it on the way in. Very clean shaven, in contrast to the rather scraggle comrades with him. Apollo Control, Houston here.
And this is Apollo Control, Houston. If you are listening to this loop you probably hear applause in the background as demonstration going on here in the Control Center that we haven't seen ever in our history. If you are in front of a television monitor, you can see an American flag, approximately 15 feet long, and about 10 feet from top to bottom. It was rigged in the Control Center earlier this morning. It has been pulled into place. Every console operator is displaying a flag at his desk, very similar to what we saw immediately after the rendezvous in Gemini VI. That's the only other time that we've seen such a display of flags in the Control Center. The earlier display didn't begin to touch this one. Huge flag. It completely blocks out the wall map that we've looked at so intensely for the last six and one half days. Everyone applauded, and in one of the loops we could hear the Star Spangled Banner. We're absolutely jammed with people here. All three Flight Controllers shifts are in the room. All the program officials.
Apollo Control here, if you can hear me above all these voices. It is a veritable roar in here. The North American people are in, the room is awash with cigar smoke. A number of congratulatory messages are coming across this console. We've seen several, we've read several. Here's one from I think it will describe itself. The world's greatest tracking station sends its heartfelt congratulations to the Apollo 8 crew, its beautiful spacecraft and all those who have shared in this magnificent accomplishment. And it's signed, of course, from the tracking station in Madrid, Spain. Courtesy of Dan Hunter, former MSC man before he moved to Madrid. We might return the compliment to Madrid which made possible so many of those beautiful television shots. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
Again this is Apollo Control. I'm not sure how well our voice is getting out. There is tremendous roar, an undercurrent and roar in the background. I have never seen a degree of this emotional outpouring in any previous mission, including Alan Shepard's. I guess one of the big differences there between that one and this one is Alan is here standing right in the middle of this one puffing on a long black cigar. I've seen rallies in locker rooms after championship games, happy politicians after elections, but never - none of them do justice to the spirit pervading this room. For the benefit of reporters listening I have been advised that we estimate the center director's and other officials well be available in our auditorium in 30 minutes for a press conference. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control here. Again, I think that many of you can see this tumult. Someone suggested that we have set the American Cancer Society's antismoking campaign back several light years, I take it from one who quit smoking a year and a half ago that this is a strong cigar. I don't know how the room can hold any more people, but they keep coming in. Someone is standing on a console next to mine. It's a photographer. I can't even make out who is in front of the flight director's desk, but he's produced box after box of cigars. Al Shepard just threw one back here. It ricocheted off the wall. That's our status.
We have just had - Apollo Control here, we have just had a chat with Donald K. Slayton, the director of Flight Crew Operations. He tells me that he plans to fly to Hawaii this afternoon. He is going out commercial; he expects the crew will land at Hickam tomorrow afternoon about 2 o'clock, Hawaii time. It will be - primarily the reason for the delay is that the carrier is out of airplane range at Hickam, Deke estimates that they will be on the ground about an hour, leaving Hawaii about 3 o'clock, Hawaii time and they should be back here at Ellington Air Force Base, next to this center about 2 o'clock Sunday morning, and I suspect that there are three families that are happy to hear that word. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control. We have been asked to pass along the figures that we have here in Mission Control Center on the time of splash, that figure is 147 hours, 00 minutes and 11 seconds. Almost precisely as planned, and to repeat again our landing coordinates: 165 degrees west; 8 degrees, 8 minutes north; also right on target. This is Apollo Control, Houston, out.
The following audio file takes place several days later, and features NBC coverage of the postflight press conference given by the astronauts themselves at the Auditorium of the State Department in Washington DC. Coverage includes the voice of NBC News Anchor Chet Huntley, as well as several commercial messages.
