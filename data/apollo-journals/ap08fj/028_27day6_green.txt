129:22:39 Collins: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
129:22:42 Lovell: Go ahead.
129:22:43 Collins: Good morning, James.
129:22:46 Lovell: Oh, it's Michael Collins, is it? Good morning to you.
129:22:50 Collins: Righto. And we're looking at your pitch CDU read-out down here and looks to us like you are about 25 degrees off the 180 for your PTC, and we were just wondering how come?
129:23:03 Lovell: We've been looking at that, too. It keeps wandering off in pitch for some reason more than yaw. I was just about ready to go back to it again. I had to go back one time, and I was just seeing how far she'd drift. I thought it would drift out a ways and come back by itself, but it is not doing it.
129:23:18 Collins: Okay.
129:23:21 Lovell: We'll get back there.
Long comm break.

129:32:11 Borman: Houston, Apollo 8. We're in the process of doing the trunnion bias check; then we'll go to P23.
129:32:20 Collins: Roger. Thank you, Frank. [Long pause.]
129:33:07 Borman: Houston, Apollo 8.
129:33:11 Collins: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
129:33:13 Borman: Roger. We'd like to have the PTC attitude to comply with P23 requirement.
129:33:23 Collins: Roger, Frank. Stand by. [Long pause.]
129:34:09 Collins: Apollo 8, Houston.
129:34:12 Borman: Go ahead.
129:34:13 Collins: Any time you want to start on those P23s is just fine.
129:34:18 Borman: Okay. I was just checking. I just wanted to know how our thermal control was going before we left. [Long pause.]
129:35:15 Collins: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
129:35:18 Borman: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
129:35:20 Collins: Your temperatures are looking good, Frank. There's still a differential temperature between quads, but nothing that would cause us in the slightest to worry about doing P23.
129:35:31 Borman: Roger. Understand.
Very long comm break.

129:47:22 Collins: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
129:47:27 Lovell: Go ahead.
129:47:28 Collins: Roger, Jim. We've been looking at these stars that we gave you this time for P23. It looks like the second star, number 11, has a trunnion angle right out near the limit, about 49.7 degrees. And we're thinking it might be a better idea to switch you over to star 1, which has a much smaller trunnion angle. What do you think? Star 1 is Alpheratz.
129:47:54 Lovell: Fine with me; I would just as soon take star 1.
129:47:58 Collins: Okay. That will be then; in place of star 11, star 1; and in place of lunar far horizon, lunar near horizon; and it remains two sets. Over.
129:48:12 Lovell: Roger. Star 1, lunar near horizon, two sets.
129:48:15 Collins: Thank you.
Very long comm break.

130:13:24 Collins: Apollo 8, Houston. Over. [No answer.]
130:13:55 Collins: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
130:13:59 Borman: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
130:14:01 Collins: Roger, Frank. Old golden fingers there is getting so swift we missed some marks on the downlink, and I wonder, if you hand recorded them, could you read us your three marks, trunnion angles, your three trunnion angles on star 2 and the last four trunnion angles on star 1. Over. [Pause.]
130:14:30 Borman: Do you read me still, Mike?
130:14:32 Collins: Stand by. We're not reading you good enough, so we'll wait until you get a better Omni.
130:14:38 Borman: That ought to be a good one.
130:14:40 Collins: That is a good one. That's loud and clear.
130:14:43 Borman: Okay. Star 2 trunnion angle, first one 05245, second one 05243, next one 05241; last 4 trunnion angles 04133, 04133, 04132, 04132.
130:15:07 Collins: Thank you kindly. [Long pause.]
130:15:27 Borman: Can you give me some idea of the updates from the midcourse that we might need, and all that good stuff, Mike?
130:15:30 Collins: Yeah, I sure can, Frank. Stand by.
Comm break.

130:17:55 Collins: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
130:17:58 Borman: Go ahead, Mike.
130:18:00 Collins: Okay. We're predicting at the nominal time of your next midcourse, which is Entry Interface minus 2 hours - we're predicting a 1.4 foot per second burn which changes your gamma at Entry Interface by a tenth of a degree. Right now, with no further maneuvers, your gamma is minus 6.39 degrees. And we're going to steepen it up very slightly to hit the center of the target line, and it will be, after the maneuver, minus 6.51. Over.
130:18:35 Borman: Very good.
130:18:38 Collins: Anything else you want like that?
130:18:42 Borman: No. I just wondered. We hadn't heard whether we were going to do it or not and so on.
130:18:48 Collins: Rog.
130:18:52 Borman: When we get the PAD data, we'll get it all out here.
130:18:58 Collins: Yeah. We'll be sending the PAD data up to you in about another 2 hours, Frank; about 132 hours GET.
130:19:06 Borman: Okay. We - this will be the last set of star sightings we do now nominally, and even if we lose comm, we'll just come on in with what we got.
130:19:19 Collins: Okay, Frank.
130:19:22 Borman: Incidentally, that comm has been fantastic. I don't know how you've heard us, but boy, it was just like you're next door even at lunar distances.
130:19:31 Collins: Yeah. It really has been great there, with the rare exception is when you are on a bad Omni right before you switch. Then we get an awful lot of background noise, but in general, it's been excellent, and boy, we're really thankful for it because reading all these updates would be bad news with bad comm, as you know.
130:19:48 Borman: Right.
130:19:50 Lovell: Say, Mike, have you noticed the confidence the Captain has in his navigator?
130:19:56 Collins: He hasn't called you Goldfinger yet.
130:20:00 Lovell: No. He is disregarding anything that I can do. We're coming in anyway. [Pause.]
130:20:13 Collins: I suspect he is right on that point.
130:20:18 Lovell: Well, back to the drawing board.
130:20:21 Borman: As usual, we are all a little pooped. I've got Bill sleeping now, and then Jim and I will swap just as soon as we get through with these stars.
130:20:30 Collins: Well, you're sounding real good, and you are doing good work.
130:20:34 Borman: Thank you.

This is Apollo Control at 130 hours, 24 minutes. During our change of shift press briefing, the crew has been primarily involved in some guidance and navigation activities onboard the spacecraft. Frank Borman reported that Bill Anders is sleeping at the present time. And at the present time our spacecraft is traveling at a speed of 6,417 feet per second [1,956 m/s]. Our current altitude is 88,706 nautical miles [155,024 km] and this is how the conversation's been going up to now.

130:56:40 Collins: Apollo 8, Houston.
130:56:43 Borman: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
130:56:45 Collins: Roger, Frank. If you get a chance to, we'd like for you to read us down your trunnion calibration number. We missed that one on the downlink, and we have an update for your Passive Thermal Control attitude.
130:56:56 Borman: Okay. The trunnion calibrations were all zeros.
130:57:00 Collins: Roger. Thank you, and on page 2-104, the PTC attitudes should read zero pitch and 45 degrees yaw. Over.
130:57:14 Borman: Zero pitch, 45 degrees at 2-104.
130:57:17 Collins: Roger. And we'd like some PRD readings for those of you who are up and around. [Long pause.]
130:57:57 Borman: Zero pitch, 45 yaw, it is?
130:58:01 Collins: Roger. Thank you.
130:58:07 Borman: I'm asking that. I didn't - I wasn't sure I copied it right.
130:58:10 Collins: Yeah. That's affirmative, Frank. Zero pitch, 45 degrees yaw.
130:58:15 Borman: My PRD now reads 2.85.
130:58:21 Collins: 2.85.

This is Apollo Control at 131 hours, 19 minutes: Our current spacecraft velocity at this time is 6,567 feet per second [2,002 m/s], and we're at an altitude of 85,284 nautical miles [157,946 km]. Since our previous report, it's been very quiet here in Mission Control Center. Most of the activity has involved checking - double checking figures, and beginning preparation to pass up the information to the crew that they will need for their final midcourse correction, 2 hours prior to entry. We've had one or two very brief conversations with the spacecraft. We'll pick those up and then stand by for any live conversation that develops.

131:33:39 Collins: Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. Over.
131:33:45 Lovell: This is 8. Loud and clear. How us?
131:33:47 Collins: Roger. You're loud and clear, Jim. We'd like to get your PRD reading while we've got you up and a Flight Plan change we're suggesting on page 2-107 when you're ready to copy.
131:34:03 Lovell: Roger. Stand by. [Pause.]
131:34:12 Lovell: I'm the only person up, and my PRD is reading 0.15.
131:34:18 Collins: Roger. Understand; 0.15.
131:34:22 Lovell: And I'll bet that Bill's is still reading 0.64.
131:34:27 Collins: That's okay; don't bother him with it. He's asleep. [Long pause.]
131:34:48 Lovell: Okay. Go ahead with your Flight Plan change. [No answer.]
131:35:11 Lovell: Houston, Apollo 8. Go ahead with your Flight Plan change.
131:35:14 Collins: Okay, Jim. On page 2-107, we're recommending that you delete that P52 and just stay in PTC attitude. Your platform is real good, and we don't feel that alignment's necessary. One is coming up again at 139 hours anyway. And also, on that same page, we'd like to delete the "begin cabin cold-soak." Over. [Pause.]
131:35:44 Lovell: Righto. We'll delete the "begin cabin cold-soak," and we'll delete the P52.
131:35:49 Collins: Okay. Thank you.

132:04:59 Collins: Roger, Apollo 8. This is Houston. Over.
132:05:03 Lovell: Roger. Mike. Are you still planning to send up these updates at 132 hours?
132:05:08 Collins: Yes; affirmative, Jim. We're getting them together now.
132:05:13 Lovell: Roger. [Long pause.]
132:06:06 Collins: Apollo 8, this is Houston. Would you please go to P00 and Accept, Jim, and we'll send you a P27. [Long pause.]
132:06:27 Lovell: We're ready for you.
132:06:29 Collins: Okay. Sending up a state vector to the LM slots.

This is Apollo Control, Houston at 132 hours, 9 minutes. Apollo 8 is at an altitude of 1 - or rather, 82,111 nautical miles [152,070 km] and our current velocity is 6,712 feet per second [2,046 m/s]. It continues to be very quiet here in Mission Control and aboard the spacecraft. We've had one or two very brief conversations with the crew and we're anticipating a call up to the spacecraft, shortly, from Mike Collins, so we'll pick that up and - and then stay tuned.

132:10:03 Collins: Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
132:10:07 Lovell: Go ahead, Houston.
132:10:08 Collins: Roger, Jim. You can go back to Block; we got the P27 in and verified. It was a state vector update to the LM slot, and I'm standing by for the midcourse correction number 7 and the entry PAD at your convenience. Over.
132:10:27 Lovell: Roger. Stand by. [Long pause.]
132:10:50 Lovell: Go ahead with midcourse number 7.
132:10:52 Collins: Okay. Midcourse correction number 7; RCS/G&N; 31600; not applicable, not applicable; 144:45:57.99; minus 0001.4, plus five zeros, plus 0000.1. Are you with me so far? Over.
132:11:42 Lovell: Roger. With you.
132:11:51 Collins: Good. 000, 304, 000; not applicable, 00019.1; 0001.4, 0:04, 0001.4; 45, 0...
132:12:38 Lovell: Hey, Mike, hold it. Hold it, Mike.
132:12:40 Collins: Okay. Holding.
132:12:45 Lovell: You said not applicable for HA. And HP, I started to copy it down, and then I didn't get the right number sequence. Did you skip down to what, VT?
132:13:04 Collins: No. Let's go back to apogee is not applicable, and then I just started reading the numbers again. From there, I've got a perigee and then a Delta-VT and then a burn time and so forth. Over.
132:13:15 Lovell: Okay. I didn't hear a plus or minus on the HP, and I only got four numbers off of it. So could you start with HP again?
132:13:22 Collins: Okay. Going back to apogee, not applicable; perigee, plus 0019.1. And you weren't hearing things; it was my mistake. Over.
132:13:41 Lovell: Roger.
132:13:43 Collins: Okay. Picking up with Delta-VT; 0001.4, 0:04, 0001.4; 45, 045.9, 22.5; Shaula, up 23.6, 00.0; plus 08.13; minus 165.03; 1220.2, 36301, 146:46:41; north set of stars, Sirius and Rigel; roll, 308; pitch, 209; yaw, 357; remarks: perigee in P30 equals plus 22.2 nautical miles. Over.
132:16:04 Lovell: Roger. Midcourse number 7; RCS/G&N; 31600; not applicable, not applicable; 144:45:57.99. Are you with me?
132:16:17 Collins: I'm with you.
132:16:20 Lovell: Minus 0001.4, plus all zeros, plus 0000.1; 000, 304, 000; not applicable, plus 0019.1; 0001.4, 0:04, 0001.4; 45, 045.9, 22.5; Shaula, up 23.6, 00.0; plus 08.13, minus 165.03; 1220.2, 36301, 146:46:41; Sirius, Rigel, 308, 209, 357; HP in P30 is 22.2 nautical miles.
132:17:24 Collins: That's all correct, Jim, and I have the entry PAD at your convenience.
132:17:32 Lovell: Roger. Stand by one. [Long pause.]
The PAD is interpreted as follows:
Purpose: This PAD is for a midcourse correction burn at the last planned opportunity, number 7, in the mission. It will refine their approach trajectory so that the spacecraft meets the atmosphere at nearly the correct flight path angle.
Systems: The burn would be made using the RCS (Reaction Control System) thrusters mounted in clusters around the Service Module, under the control of the Guidance and Navigation system.
CSM Weight (Noun 47): 31,600 pounds (14,334 kg).
Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48): Not applicable. These would normally represent angles for the SPS engine. Since this is an RCS burn, they are not required.
Time of ignition (Noun 33): 144 hours, 45 minutes, 57.99 seconds.
Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s): X, -1.4 (-0.4); Y, 0 (0); Z, +0.1 (+0.03). The change in velocity is resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the Local Vertical frame of reference. The main point to note is that the major part of the DeltaV is negative. It is against their motion and therefore retarding the spacecrfat slightly. This therefore steepens their entry angle.
Spacecraft attitude: Roll, 000°; Pitch, 304°; Yaw, 000°. The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform.
HA, expected apogee of resulting orbit (Noun 44): Not applicable. The height of the resulting orbit is beyond the limit of the computer's display and in this context, is irrelevant.
HP, expected perigee of resulting orbit (Noun 44): +19.1 nautical miles (+35.4 km). The perigee distance is so low, it intersects the Earth's atmosphere. What this really means is that the spacecraft will re-enter.
Delta-VT: 1.4 fps (0.4 m/s). This is the total change in velocity the spacecraft would experience and is a vector sum of the three components given above.
Burn duration or burn time: 4 seconds.
Delta-VC: 1.4 fps. Using its ability to independently measure acceleration, the EMS can shut down the burn in case the G&N system fails to do so.
Sextant star: Star 45 (Fomalhaut, Alpha Piscis Austrini) visible in sextant when shaft and trunnion angles are 45.9° and 22.5° respectively. This is part of an attitude check.
Boresight star: Shaula (Lambda Scorpii) is visible through the COAS (Crew Optical Alignment Sight) when set to angles; Up 23.6, 0.
COAS Pitch Angle: Up 23.6°.
COAS X Position Angle: 0°.
The next five parameters all relate to re-entry, during which an important milestone is "Entry Interface," defined as being 400,000 feet (121.92 km) altitude. In this context, a more important milestone is when atmospheric drag on the spacecraft imparts a deceleration of 0.05 g.
Expected splashdown point (Noun 61): 8.13° north, 165.03° west; in the mid-Pacific.
Range to go at the 0.05 g event: 1,220.2 nautical miles. To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance the CM would travel from the 0.05 g event to landing. This figure will be decremented by the EMS based on signals from its own accelerometer.
Expected velocity at the 0.05 g event: 36,301 fps. This is another entry for the EMS. It is entered into the unit's Delta-V counter and will be decremented based on signals from its own accelerometer.
Predicted GET of 0.05 g event: 146 hours, 46 minutes and 41 seconds GET.
GDC Align stars: The stars to be used for GDC Align purposes are Sirius and Rigel.
GDC Align angles: Roll, 308°; pitch, 209°; yaw, 357°.
The PAD includes one additional note. In Program 30, the height for their perigee, HP, is 22.2 nautical miles (41.1 km).
132:17:50 Lovell: Ready to copy. Mike.
132:17:52 Collins: Okay. Entry PAD: the area, mid-Pacific; 357, 152, 359; 146:29:13; 268, plus 08.13, minus 165.03; 068, 36221, 651, 1220.2, 36301, 146:46:13, 0028, not applicable four times, in other words, DL MAX, DL MIN, VL MAX, and VL MIN - all not applicable. Starting with D0: 4.00, 02:07, 00:25, 03:33, 08:16; 16, 059.0, 31.2. And your boresight star, Zeta Persei, which is half way between Mirfak and Aldebaran, up 16.5, right 3.4, up. Remarks: use non-exit EMS pattern. Over. [Pause.]
This is the first entry PAD to be passed to the crew. Two more version will be read up in about 11 and 13 hours' time as the Retro flight controller refines his calculations.
Before interpreting the PAD, it may be useful to explain some of the terminology used. The first important concept is that of Entry Interface, a completely arbitrary event which is defined as the time when the spacecraft (then consisting of only the Command Module) reaches an altitude of 400,000 feet (65.83 nautical miles, 121.92 km). Being arbitrary, it is not subject to the vagaries of the atmosphere but it allows calculations to be made with respect to the spacecraft's current state vector.
A second concept is the 0.05g event, and this one does depend on the state of the atmosphere. This is the point at which the increasing drag of the atmosphere's outer fringes causes a deceleration measuring a twentieth of a g. For calculation sake, prior to entry actually occurring, it is taken to occur at an altitude of 297,432 feet (48.95 nautical miles, 90.66 km) but it will occur when the spacecraft's guidance system detects a change in velocity of 0.49 m/s2 (0.05g). Detection triggers a change in the entry program run by the computer and also initiates the monitoring of the trajectory by the EMS (Entry Monitoring System).
Note that some events in the PAD are tied to the Entry Interface event, others to the 0.05g event. The data passed up for this entry PAD are interpreted as follows:
Purpose: Entry.
Landing target: The landing target is in the Mid-Pacific.
IMU gimbal angles required for trim at 0.05g: Roll, 357°; pitch, 152°; yaw, 359°.
Time of the horizon check: 146 hours, 29 minutes, 13 seconds GET.
Spacecraft pitch at horizon check: 268°. This is 17 minutes before time of entry.
Splashdown point: 8.13° north latitude, 165.03° west longitude.
Maximum number of g's during entry: 6.8.
Velocity at Entry Interface (400,000 feet altitude): 36,221 feet/second (11,040 metres/second).
Entry flight path angle at Entry Interface: 6.51°. This is very close to the angle they are aiming for, 6.5°.
Range to go to splashdown point from 0.05g event: 1,220.2 nautical miles. To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance the CM would travel from the 0.05 g event to landing. This figure will be decremented by the EMS based on signals from its own accelerometer.
Predicted inertial velocity at 0.05g event: 36,301 feet/second. This is another entry for the EMS. It is entered into the unit's Delta-V counter and will be decremented based on signals from its own accelerometer.
Time of Entry Interface: 146 hours, 46 minutes, 13 seconds GET.
Time from Entry Interface to 0.05g event: 0:28 (seconds).
The next four items are not applicable to this version of the Entry PAD because they refer to a skip-out type of re-entry.
Planned drag level (deceleration) during the constant g phase (D0): 4.00g.
VCIRC: 2:07. This is the time from Entry Interface to when their velocity has slowed sufficiently to allow a circular orbit around the Earth. The practical implication of this is that this is the "capture point" where the CM will no longer be able to skip off the atmosphere. Since the spacecraft will already be within the Earth's sensible atmosphere at this point, drag will continue to slow the spacecraft and the return to Earth is assured.
Time from Entry Interface that the communications blackout begins: 0:25.
Time from Entry Interface that the communications blackout ends: 3:33.
Time from Entry Interface that the drogue parachutes will deploy: 8:16.
Sextant star: 16 (Procyon, Alpha Canis Minoris.)
Sextant shaft angle at Entry Interface minus 2 minutes: 59.0°.
Sextant trunnion angle at Entry Interface minus 2 minutes: 31.2°.
Boresight star: Zeta Persei. This is an attitude check made using the COAS sighted on a star two minutes before Entry Interface.
Boresight Star pitch angle on COAS: Up 16.5°.
Boresight Star X position on COAS: Right 3.4°.
Lift vector at Entry Interface: Up.
There is a comment in addition to the PAD. The EMS scroll has two patterns, one each for the two different types of entries the spacecraft can make. Apollo 8 is to use the version suited to their non-exiting type of re-entry.
132:21:09 Lovell: Right, Mike. Stand by.
132:21:13 Lovell: Entry as follows: mid-Pacific, 357, 152, 359; 146:29:13; 268, plus 08.13, minus 165.03; 068, 36221, 651, 1220.2, 36301, 146:46:13, 0028, N/A 4 times, with D0 4.00, 02:07, 00:25, 03:33, 08:16; 16, 059.0, 31.2; Zeta Persei, up 16.5, right 3.4; up. And remarks: use non-exit EMS pattern. And Zeta Persei is between Mirfak and Aldebaran, and Frank can never find it anyway.
132:22:25 Collins: Okay. That's all correct. [Long pause.]
132:23:13 Lovell: We certainly don't waste much time getting down to drogue deploy, do we?
132:23:19 Collins: Roger. That's, that's true.

132:34:43 Lovell: Go ahead, Houston.
132:34:45 Collins: Roger, Jim. In your computer, we'd like to do an erasable memory dump again, like we did the other day, and the reason we'd like to do it is, when you did that P37 about 8 hours ago, and you remember you put that EI time in for TIG and got that P00-doo thing; we'd like to - We don't think there's anything in the world wrong with it. We think everything is just perfect inside the computer, but we'd like to do an erasable dump as we did the other day; go through it bit by bit. Give us something to do down here. Over.
132:35:23 Lovell: Okay. Any time.
132:35:26 Collins: And I have the procedures for you when you're ready to copy.
132:35:32 Lovell: Go ahead.
132:35:33 Collins: Okay. Verb 01 Noun 01 Enter, 333 Enter, and then read out register 1, and that register 1 should be 10000, 1 0 0 0 0. And then if it's not, I can give you a procedure for getting it to 10000. If it is 10000 as we expect, then Verb 74 Enter, and that'll do the dump. Over.
132:36:10 Lovell: Roger. When do you want it? [Long pause.]
132:36:22 Collins: And, Apollo 8, you can do the first part of that now at your convenience to verify that register 1 is reading 10000, but would you hold up on the dump itself until we get our ground stations configured, please. Over.
132:36:38 Lovell: Will do.

This is Apollo Control, Houston at 134 hours, 11 minutes and at the present time our spacecraft velocity is 7,123 feet per second [2,171 m/s]. Our current altitude reading is 73,952 nautical miles [136,959 km]. Since our last report we've had virtually no conversations with the spacecraft with the exception of a short communications check put in by Mike Collins a few minutes ago and a terse 'Roger' back from Bill Anders. There is nothing showing on the Flight Plan at this time. No scheduled activities. And both Frank Borman and Jim Lovell are scheduled to be getting some rest at this time. We'd like to, at this point, repeat some of the figures that were passed out earlier today at our change of shift briefing on the sequence of events at re-entry. We, at the present time, show 12 hours, 33 minutes, 55 seconds until Entry Interface. That event will occur at a Ground Elapsed Time of 146 hours, 46 minutes, 13 seconds approximately; and we anticipate there could be some change in that number following our final midcourse correction which is to come about 2 hours prior to Entry Interface. Blackout would nominally begin, with the current trajectory, at 146 hours, 46 minutes, 38 seconds; and it would last about 3 minutes. They would come out of blackout at 146 hours, 49 minutes, 41 seconds. Our drogue chutes, the two 16½-foot [5-metre] diameter conical ribbon chutes, that give the spacecraft its initial stabilization and slow it down prior to main chute deploy, that event would come at 146 hours, 54 minutes, 27 seconds. We would be on the drogue chutes for about 47 seconds and then the main chutes would deploy at 146 hours, 55 minutes, 14 seconds. Our nominal splash time would be 147 hours, 0 minutes and 11 seconds. At 134 hours, 14 minutes into the flight of Apollo 8; this is Mission Control, Houston.

134:38:09 Anders: I had my hands full; I was putting something down. I read you fine.
134:38:13 Collins: Okay. Understand. If it'll be any help to you in your PTC driving, we've computed that as you look out plus-X in the COAS or just out the window, you should be pointed right at Acrux when you're in a perfect PTC attitude. We don't know whether that's a help to you or not, but we thought you might enjoy trying an alternate mode of keeping the attitude under control.
134:38:40 Anders: Okay. From my present position, we're going to have to move Acrux a little bit. [Pause.]
134:38:50 Collins: Well, whatever you think. We just thought you might appreciate knowing. [Pause.]
134:39:03 Anders: I'll give it a try, Mike. I can see Acrux...
134:39:07 Collins: Can you see it all right?
134:39:09 Anders: Yeah, I think so. There's a star out there anyway.

134:40:59 Collins: Go ahead, Bill.
134:41:02 Anders: Actually, Mike, it's so easy to do it with the eight-ball within a reasonable sloppy limit that it's hardly worth the trouble to scootch way up to the seat to look out the COAS, and it's enough light in the cockpit where the star really isn't too easy to see. So I'm kind of inclined to use the IFR technique here where you can see the rest of the instrument panel.

This is Apollo Control at 135 hours, 39 minutes and it continues to be very quiet here in Mission Control and aboard the spacecraft. There are no scheduled Flight Plan activities at this time. Two of our three crewmen are continuing in a sleep, or rest period. Bill Anders is awake and minding the duties aboard the spacecraft while Frank Borman and Jim Lovell catch up on their sleep, At the present time Apollo 8 is traveling at a speed of 7,480 feet per second [2,280 m/s]. Our current altitude is 67,744 nautical miles [125,462 km]. The clock here in Mission Control that's been counting toward re-entry now shows 11 hours, 6 minutes prior to that event. This is the communications that we've had with Anders in the past 45 minutes or so, then we'll stand by for any live conversation.

That brings us up to date with the conversations with Anders over the past 45 minutes or so since our previous announcement. At the present time here in Mission Control Center, the large center display map of the world with the spacecraft ground track on it, we're beginning to see a gradual effect of the increaseing Earth's gravitational influence on the spacecraft. That ground track now beginning to swing slowly northward and we'll see it, between now and re-entry, swing even more northward and eventually reverse its direction as the spacecraft plunges back toward Earth. It doesn't appear that we are going to have any further conversation with the spacecraft at this point. We'll continue to monitor and come back up periodically with status reports or in the event that we have any significant communications from the crew. This is Apollo Control at 135 hours, 43 minutes.

This is Apollo Control at 136 hours, 52 minutes. Since our past - our last report, activity here in Mission Control and on the spacecraft has been minimal. We have had a few communications checks with the spacecraft and some routine housekeeping chores being done by the crew. Very little Flight Plan activity scheduled at this time. At the present time, Apollo 8 is at an altitude of 62,413 nautical miles [115,589 km] and our velocity reads 7,825 feet per second [2,385 m/s]. We have one bit of interesting information from our Flight Dynamics Officer, which illustrates the rapid velocity increase we'll see as the spacecraft nears Earth in its final hour of flight. Beginning at 145 hours, 41 minutes; or about 1 hour prior to Entry Interface, we'll have a velocity of 18,013 feet per second [5,490 m/s]. During the next hour, as the spacecraft closes on Earth from an altitude of some 10,445 nautical miles [19,344 km], our velocity will just about double, reaching 36,220 feet per second [11,040 m/s]. We saw much the same sort of thing happen as our spacecraft neared the Moon, where, in the final hour or so of flight, we saw that dramatic increase in velocity. And now returning to Earth, we're seeing the same sort of thing. A gradual build up until just about the last hour of flight and then that dramatic increase in velocity from 18,013 feet per second to 36,220. We have a brief bit of conversation on tape from the past 45 minutes or so. We'll play that back for you now and then stand by briefly for any live conversation.
For the following audio clip, portions were lost on the Houston air-to-ground record due to a change of tapes, but the Honeysuckle Tracking Station captured the conversation.

Here in Mission Control Center at the present time, we're involved in a change of shift. Flight Director Milton Windler and his team of flight controllers are coming on, getting updated on the status of the spacecraft, the crew, and preparations for the re-entry. This is the team coming on that will be handling the re-entry, and that event now scheduled to occur some 7 hours, 47 minutes from now. Simultaneously with the change of shift here in the Control Center, we also begin to pick up activity in the Flight Plan related to the final midcourse correction and re-entry. Now we're scheduled to have a platform alignment in about 15 minutes aboard the spacecraft, and that'll be followed by an eat period for the Commander. The Flight Plan shows the Command Module Pilot to continue sleeping until about 141 hours and at the present time it appears that Frank Borman and Jim Lovell are resting or sleeping. We'll continue to stand by for a short while for any further communication from Bill Anders, and then we'll take the circuit down if we don't hear any.
