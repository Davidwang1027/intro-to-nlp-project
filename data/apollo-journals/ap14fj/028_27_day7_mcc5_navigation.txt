The seventh day of the mission commences with the crew sound asleep after a very busy three days of lunar science. Their journey home is proceeding well, and while they have some further scientific and technical goals to fulfil, it is possible now to rest for a moment and enjoy the sights outside the slowly rotating spacecraft.
Editor's note: All transcript times are presented according to the GET update at 054:53:36 that saw the mission timer moved forward 40 minutes, 2.90 seconds.
This is Apollo Control 152 hours, 41 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 14 now 9,477 miles out from the Moon, traveling at a velocity of 4,587 feet per second. Crew of Apollo 14 apparently have gone to bed for the night, put out the cat, and the alarm clock set for 10 hours, 17 minutes from now. We'll take down the air to ground circuit at this time, record any future conversation during the night on tape for delay playback. And, at 152 hours, 42 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
Their distance from the Moon is now 17,551 kilometers and their velocity is 1,398 m/s.
...53 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The crew of Apollo 14 apparently is asleep at this time. Spacecraft now 10,824 nautical miles out from the Moon on the return leg home. Velocity now 4,519 feet per second. Nine hours 47 minutes remaining in the sleep period. Rather quiet here in the Control Center; some of the flight controllers here on the gold team who were asleep during this morning's second EVA are planning to view a playback of the lunar television, here on the large color Idophor background television projector in the control room. And at 153 hours, 13 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
They are 20,046 kilometers from the Moon and traveling at 1,377 m/s.
This is Apollo Control 154 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The crew of Apollo 14 still asleep at this time. The spacecraft revolving slowly about the longitudinal axis. Control mode longitudinal, stabilize the current response of the spacecraft in all consistency. 8 hours 47 minutes remaining in the sleep period. The distance now 13,457 from the Moon. Velocity 4,421 feet per second. The spacecraft weight 24,627 pounds. And at this time in the night, that's about all that can be said. At 154 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
Apollo 14 has travelled 24,922 km from the Moon, and is currently coasting away at 1,348 m/s. The lunar gravity is still pulling on them and slowing the spacecraft down, until Earth gravity will take over and they begin to accelerate again.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 155 hours, 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 14 is presently 16,000 nautical miles out from the Moon, and traveling at a velocity of 4,354 feet per second. The crew continues in it's - in their sleep period. Our clock in Mission Control shows 7 hours 47 minutes until time of wakeup. We've had a shift change in Mission Control. The Black Team of flight controllers now aboard, very little activity, very little conversation on the flight directors loop over this past hour. We forecast much of the same for the next hour but we will stand by and continue to monitor. At 155 hours, 13 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
Distance, 29,632 km and increasing. 1,327 m/s.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 156 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The crew of Apollo 14 continuing in their sleep period. Our clock in Mission Control shows 6 hours 48 minutes until scheduled time of wakeup. Meanwhile, literally no conversation within the control center, certainly a period of more relaxed atmosphere for the Orange flight control team compared to the last two days. This is the team that worked during the two lunar excursions or walks on the Moon by crewmembers Shepard - Al Shepard and Ed Mitchell. We're at 156 hours 13 minutes continuing to monitor and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
Apollo Control, Houston, 156 hours, 14 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and at this time we show the Apollo 14 spacecraft at a distance of 18,651 nautical miles away from the Moon travelling at velocity of 4,303 feet per second. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
Distance from the Moon is now 34,542 kilometers, and their velocity is 1,312 m/s.
This is Apollo Control in Houston at 157 hours and 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Our display presently shows Apollo 14 at a distance of 21,093 nautical miles on it's return trip from the Moon and traveling at a speed of 4,268 feet per second relative to the Moon. We've had no change in status since our last report. Ail parameters remain normal. The crew of Apollo 14, Al Shepard, Stu Roosa, Ed Mitchell, still sleeping. Our clock in Mission Control shows 5 hours 47 minutes remaining until their wake up call is to be placed. So at 157 hours 13 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 158 hours 15 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 14 returning now to Earth. We read on our displays a distance of 23,719 nautical miles away from the Moon and traveling at a velocity of 4,238 feet per second. The spacecraft weight presently 24,627 pounds, considerably lighter than the weight that we saw at lift off or even prior to TEI, at which time Antares no longer belonged to the stack. Although you haven't heard him, our CapCom is Ron Evans. Ron the backup Command Module Pilot for Apollo 14 will probably make the wakeup call, some 4 hours and 44 minutes from this time. We're at 158 hours 16 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control Houston.
The spacecraft weight (or mass!) is approximated at 24,637 pounds. Engineering data suggests that the approximate mass before Translunar Injection would have been 35,008 pounds and 24,949 pounds afterwards, meaning that they consumed some 10,050 pounds of fuel and oxidizer for the burn. They have shed further mass since the TEI from spent fuel cell reactants, waste water dumps, and used RCS fuel.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 159 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Our display presently shows Apollo 14 at a distance from the Moon of 26,123.6 nautical miles and traveling at a velocity of 4,219 feet per second. The sleep period for the crew of Apollo 14 continues. We presently show 3 hours 47 minutes until time of wakeup. Literally no conversation over the loops in Mission Control. Flight controllers are on a standby situation, of course monitoring their various displays, reading out parameters. Meanwhile we do have some times, velocities, and distances for various milestone events en route to the Earth from the Moon and we'll pass those along now. Sphere crossing time, this being the time that Apollo 14 will cross out of the lunar sphere of influence and into the Earth's sphere of influence. The Ground Elapsed Time reading for this event 162 hours 19 minutes 8 seconds. At that time, Apollo 14 will be at a distance of 184,793 nautical miles away from the Earth and at a distance of 33,821 nautical miles away from the Moon. Fourteen's velocity relative to Earth will be 3,462 feet per second; fourteen's velocity relative to the Moon at that time will be 4,173 feet per second. The next event will be that point in time when the 2 velocity references will match, the velocity relative to the Earth the velocity relative to the Moon. The time of this event, Ground Elapsed Time of 182 hours 3 minutes. At that time Apollo 14 will be at a distance of 140,446 nautical miles away from the Earth and a distance of 82,765 nautical miles out from the Moon. The velocity matching speed will read 4,370 feet per second. The midpoint in terms of time, reference here from time of the TEI burn cut-off to entry, will be at a Ground Elapsed Time of 183 hours 10 minutes. Fourteen will be at a distance of 137,581 nautical miles away from Earth and at 85,625 nautical miles out from the Moon. The midpoint in time velocity relative to the Earth will read 4,440 feet per second; velocity relative to the Moon 4,355 feet per second. The midpoint in terms of distance will occur at a Ground Elapsed Time of 192 hours 39 minutes 45 seconds and at that point, the equal distance reading will be 110 931 nautical miles and fourteen will be traveling at a velocity of 5,216 feet per second relative to the Earth and 4,764 feet per second relative to the Moon. We're at 159 hours 18 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 160 hours 18 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Our displays in Mission Control show Apollo 14 at a distance of 28,859 nautical miles away from the Moon and travelling at a velocity of 4,197 feet per second. We presently show 2 hours 41 minutes until that time of crew wakeup. However, we are presently monitoring medical data on Command Module Pilot Stu Roosa which indicates to the Surgeon that Roosa is presently awake. However, relaxing in the cabin of his spacecraft. We're at 160 hours 20 minutes.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 161 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We presently show Apollo 14 at a distance of 31,065 nautical miles away from the Moon, traveling at a velocity of 4,185 feet per second. Our mission control clock shows 1 hour and 47 minutes remaining until time of crew wake up. Stu Roosa apparently dosing off again, our medical monitoring indicates. Very quiet in mission control. Literally no conversation over the loops, and at this point all parameters appear outstandingly normal. We're at 161 hours 13 minutes and this is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 162 hours, 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Our displays in Mission Control presently show Apollo 14 at a distance of 33,532 nautical miles away from the Moon, and traveling at a velocity relative to the Moon - 4,174 feet per second. Over the past hour in a discussion with Orange Team Flight Director, Pete Frank, our Retrofire Officer Charles Deiterich described the Trans-Earth Injection burn as very good. Perhaps the best ever. The flight path angle now reading minus 6.81 degrees, well within the corridor, RETRO reporting. Accordingly, it has been definitely decided Apollo 14 will not perform Midcourse Correction number 5. The current Ground Elapsed Time for entry into the Earth's atmosphere now reads 216 hours, 27 minutes, 32 seconds. Also in this report RETRO noted that the groundtrack has shifted west by 68 nautical miles. The present aiming point coordinates read 172 degrees, 38 minutes west. 27 degrees, 2 minutes south. If this aim point continues to hold Apollo 14's splashdown point would be 8 miles across the international date line. At the aim point coordinates the international date line runs down 172 degrees, 30 minutes west longitude. Although Al Shepard, Ed Mitchell, and Stu Roosa went to sleep believing Tuesday was their landing day, Apollo 14 could very well splash down 8 miles into Wednesday. Or if Shepard's landing on the Moon in Antares is an indicator, who knows Apollo 14 may come down within 87 feet or less of the international date line. We're at 162 hours, 15 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 163 hours 5 minutes. In Mission Control at this time our Flight Director Milton Windler and the Maroon Team of Flight Controllers are in the process of taking over from Pete Frank and the Orange Team. And we're about four minutes 50 seconds away from the scheduled crew awakening time. At the present time, Apollo 14 is traveling at a velocity of 4,166 feet per second, and 35,709 nautical miles from the Moon. We'll stand by for the crew awakening, now in about five minutes.
At this distance from the Moon, they are rapidly approaching the invisible border between the Moon's dominant gravisphere and Earth's sphere of gravitational influence.
163:22:15 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. Reveille, Reveille; heave out and trice up.
This morning, Bruce McCandless - a Lieutenant Commander - has decided to rouse the Apollo 14 crew with a traditional US Navy wakeup call - perhaps to the pleasure of Navy Men Al and Ed and to tease Air Force Major Stu Roosa.
163:22:29 Mitchell: Good morning, Bruce. How are you this morning?
163:22:31 McCandless: Sweepers , man your brooms; clean sweepdown fore and aft.
163:22:38 Mitchell: Yes, all the sweepers are still asleep around here.
163:22:43 McCandless: Okay, Ed. How are you all this morning?
163:22:48 Mitchell: Really great, Bruce; really great. How are things there?
163:22:52 McCandless: Beautiful; everybody's relaxed down here and anticipating your arrival on schedule.
163:23:00 Mitchell: Very good.
163:23:02 Roosa: Good morning, Bruce.
163:23:05 McCandless: Who's that? Stu?
163:23:08 Mitchell: Yes, he's waking up over there.
163:23:00 Roosa: Yes, man.
163:23:11 McCandless: Hey, Ed, if you feel like configuring the High Gain Antenna for us, we'd like to set up in a Reacq mode but not select High Gain, yet. Over.
163:23:25 Mitchell: Okay.
163:23:27 McCandless: Okay, first off, we need the - -
163:23:29 Mitchell: My angles - -
163:23:32 McCandless: Roger. We need a Pitch of minus 40 and a Yaw of plus 90, that's Pitch, minus 40; Yaw, plus 90, set in on the dials; Wide Beam, Manual Track -make it Wide Beam and Reacq, but do not select the High Gain Antenna until we call you.
163:23:56 Mitchell: Okay, Houston. Out.
163:24:00 McCandless: Roger. And I guess we needed to have the High Gain in Manual long enough for the antenna to go to those angles, then to Reacq.
163:24:16 Mitchell: It's there.
163:24:17 McCandless: Beautiful.
163:24:36 McCandless: 14, Houston. When you all feel like discussing things, we've got oh - about five or six items here, including a consumables update and a short update to the procedures on one of the inflight demos, and some discussion on midcourses in general. Nothing very pressing; in fact, nothing pressing at all. We would like to get the P23 scheduled at 164 hours, started within about half an hour of the nominal time. Over.
163:25:18 Roosa: Yes, Bruce. I'd like to go ahead and maybe start that one about now and then, P23, go ahead get going on it.
163:26:09 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. We'd like you to select the High Gain Antenna at this time. And, Stu, we see that you've got a P52 to run prior to getting to the P23. We suggest you go ahead and go through that and start the P23, more or less, at the nominal time.
163:26:11 Mitchell (onboard): Houston, Apollo 14.
163:26:35 Roosa: Okay.
163:26:38 Mitchell: Adjust High Gain.
Long comm break.
163:30:31 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. Did you call?
163:30:37 Mitchell: Yes, that's affirm. I went to Reacq, Bruce. The antennas started driving around in a wild circle. I'm back on the Omnis now.
163:30:48 McCandless: Okay. We copy, Ed. Stand by.
Comm break.
163:32:07 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. We'd like to remain on Omnis. You may stow the High Gain Antenna, Manual and Wide, at Pitch, minus 52; Yaw, 270. Over.
163:32:24 Mitchell: Roger. Manual and Wide; minus 52 and 270.
163:32:30 McCandless: Roger.
163:33:13 Mitchell: (Garble)
163:39:34 Shepard: Houston, Apollo 14 standing by for the consumables update.
163:39:40 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. The consumables update for 162 hours follows: RCS total 48.8; quads in order, 48.9, 48.1, 49.6, 48.6; hydrogen, 45.7, 45.0; oxygen, 73.0, 70.2, 21.6. Over.
163:40:27 Shepard: Houston - -
163:40:30 McCandless: Say it again, 14.
163:40:37 Shepard: Okay. A readback of 162 hours - -
163:40:52 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. We're changing antennas. Standby, please.
Long comm break.
163:46:29 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. How do you read now? Over.
163:46:35 Mitchell: Loud and clear; go ahead.
163:46:37 McCandless: Roger, Ed. I didn't get your readback on that consumables update. We switched Omni antennas about that time. Were you happy with what you copied?
163:46:48 Mitchell: That's affirm. Here, I'll read it back to you. The only ones in doubt is the 02 tank 3 and, first decimal place. Okay, GET 162:00; RCS 48.8, order of 48.9, 48.1, 49.6, 48.6; H 45.7, 45.0; 0 73.0, 70.2, 21.
163:47:19 McCandless: Roger. 21.6 on 02 tank 3; and whenever it's convenient with you all, we would like to get that postsleep status report and acknowledgment on the postwakeup stuff on 162.
163:47:44 Mitchell: Roger. I'll have it for you in a minute.
163:47:46 McCandless: Roger. No rush.
163:48:28 McCandless: 14, Houston. We are copying your torquing angles
Once again, the computer telemetry allows Mission Control to review the data without Stu needing to read them out over the radio.
163:48:34 Roosa: Okay, Bruce, and I'm torquing at 163:48:37.
This is Stu's 23rd P52 realignment of the guidance platform during the flight. As a reference, he sighted on star 11 (Aldebaran) and star 16 (Procyon). As a check of his sighting accuracy, the computer compared the measured angle between these stars and the actual angle. The difference between them was 000.00 degrees, or 'all balls' , a perfect result. Finally, the computer displayed Noun 93, the angles by which the gimbals would be rotated or 'torqued' to restore perfect alignment. These were 0.046° in X, -0.174° in Y and 0.017° in Z axis. According to the post-flight Mission Report, the platform was torqued at 163:49 GET.
163:48:47 McCandless: Roger, Stu. And you can go on with the P23 whenever it suits your convenience.
163:48:55 Roosa: Okay.
Comm break.
163:51:29 Mitchell: Houston, 14.
163:51:31 McCandless: Go ahead, 14.
163:51:36 Mitchell: Okay, we verify that ...
163:51:40 McCandless: You're cutting out, Ed.
163:51:45 Mitchell: All of the items on the postsleep checklist have been completed. Al had 7 hours sleep, Stu 6, Ed 7. And, unfortunately, the PRD is not available at the moment, and we will have to forget about the ...
163:52:01 McCandless: Roger. We copy.
163:52:13 Mitchell: Yes, and we've had no medication. We are all in excellent ... So, just tell the surgeon to sit back in his chair and have a cup of coffee; we're fine.
163:52:25 McCandless: Okay, I'll see if the recovery coffee or the procedures coffee - network coffee pot is working here, and we'll get him a cup of coffee.
Mission Control audio loop recordings have numerous occurances of the Flight Surgeon using the intercom system to order such a delivery to his station in MOCR, so the joke is not far off.
163:52:37 Mitchell: Have one for me, too.
163:52:39 McCandless: I just did, Ed.
Comm break.
163:55:48 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. On arrival in the optics-calibration attitude, we'd like to get the High Gain Antenna in Wide Beam width, Manual and with the flight-plan angles. Over.
The Flight Plan gives the High Gain Antenna pointing angles as - 68° in pitch and 73° in yaw.
163:56:03 Roosa: Okay. We can handle that, Bruce.
163:56:07 McCandless: Roger, Stu. And could you also verify that you're still on the Secondary, Servo Electronics, Power for the High Gain?
163:56:17 Roosa: That's verified.
163:56:20 McCandless: Okay.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 164 hours, 2 minutes. At the present time we're reading a velocity for Apollo 14 of 3,516 feet per second and we now show the spacecraft 181,300 nautical miles from Earth. The Flight Dynamics Officer and the retro fire officer are currently reviewing the status of a midcourse correction at the midcourse correction 5 opportunity. That opportunity for the first trans-Earth midcourse correction occurs about 116 hours, 15 minutes and one of the things that the retro fire and Flight Dynamics Officers are considering is what effect the high O2 flow rate test which will involve some venting of oxygen will have on the trajectory and particularly on the flight path angle at entry interface. At the present time, the Retrofire Officer says that the angle at the entry interface angle is within the corridor, however, if the oxygen venting is determined to have the effect of moving it closer toward the edge of the corridor, rather than towards the center of the corridor there may be some rethought given to performing midcourse correction 5. Those discussions are in process at the present time and we will probably have a decision one way or the next on midcourse correction 5 within about an hour.
Velocity clocks in at 1,072 m/s and their distance is 335,768 km from Earth.
Apollo 14 has now passed into Earth's sphere of influence, and this is also indicated by the PAO stating their decreasing distance from Earth, rather than their increasing distance from the Moon.
164:02:56 Mitchell: Houston, switching to the High Gain.
164:03:10 McCandless: Roger, 14; we're receiving you loud and clear, now.
164:03:39 McCandless: And, Ed; this is Houston. If you have got the Flight Plan handy, I've got a change to the heat flow and convection procedures, as called out in the back of the Flight Plan for you.
164:03:52 Mitchell: Stand by, I don't have it handy, ... Houston, just a moment. But - -
164:03:57 McCandless: Okay, well, let's get that later. Let him use it.
164:05:12 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. Just for your information, RCS status shows about 131 feet per second Delta-V remaining, and SPS is about 510 feet per second. Over.
Ample fuel remains for any future needs for attitude changes and also for midcourse corrections, should they be required.
164:05:34 Mitchell: Okay, Bruce. Thank you.
164:05:39 McCandless: And, looking ahead at the midcourse situation here, we'll have a decision for you shortly on whether we want to burn midcourse 5 or not. Right now, its magnitude looks like something on the order of a half to three-quarters of a foot per second. With no midcourses at all coming back, your gamma is minus 6.97 degrees. If we start making midcourses, 5 they say, would be about a half to three-quarters of 6's on the order of three-quarters of a foot per second, and 7 looks like about 2.7 or something on that order reading out. We'll keep you posted. We owe you some detail procedures on probe stowage, which will be up later on today. And, when Stu gets through with the P23, we'd like to clarify the status of his biomed harness. We didn't get any data from him up until about 160 hours this morning; and then, it came in loud and clear.
164:06:55 Mitchell: Okay. I think we can clarify that for you.
164:06:57 Roosa: I can verify the biomed harness is okay, Bruce.
164:07:01 McCandless: Okay. Was it switched on all the time, or did you get up and switch it on about 160?
164:07:11 Roosa: You've got it right.
The biomedical harnesses are switched on by selecting Suit Power - On from their respective comms control panels.
164:07:18 McCandless: Roger, Out.
164:07:52 McCandless: And, 14; this is Houston. I've got some questions on the subject of the AGS again for Ed, when he's free; and we've also got some news items if you're interested in hearing the news.
Long comm break.
164:17:10 McCandless: Apollo 14; this is Houston, Stu. Over.
164:17:18 Roosa: Go ahead, Bruce.
164:17:19 McCandless: Yes, Stu. If you could leave your Noun 49 up there in the DSKY just a little bit longer, we could copy. We got the first one okay. We missed the last one here.
Noun 49
164:17:28 Roosa: Okay. The first one was 21.2, and the second one was 1.9.
164:17:32 McCandless: Okay, thank you.
164:17:42 Roosa: And, Bruce? I want to verify that the state vector I'm working on now is the - is the TEI state vector. Is that affirmative?
164:18:00 McCandless: That's affirmative, Stu. And we'd like to get Medium Beam Width on the High Gain.
164:18:16 Mitchell: Got it, Bruce.
164:18:19 McCandless: Thank you, Ed.
164:19:36 McCandless: Okay. We got that one, Stu. Just about 5 or 10 seconds is enough.
164:19:46 Roosa: Okay.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 164 hours 24 minutes. Apollo 14 now 180,547 nautical miles from Earth and traveling at a velocity of 3,528 feet per second. Stu Roosa, onboard the Command Module Kitty Hawk, is at this moment performing a midcourse navigation exercise down in Program 23. Taking sightings and marks on a series of stars. Entering these into the guidance computer which is then integrated by the computer to improve the onboard guidance systems knowledge of where it is. The Flight Activities Officer reports that this activity will probably continue for about 30 minutes, 30 - 40 minutes.
Their distance is 334,373 kilometers from Earth, and they are moving in at 1,075 m/s. This far out, their velocity is increasing slowly for now.
164:30:16 McCandless: And, Stu, this is Houston. We're readying a checkpoint down here and, consequently, have no data for a minute or two. We'll call you when we're back in business; otherwise, we'd like you to keep the Noun 49 for this next star, Antares, showing until we call you. Over.
Routine maintenance on the IBM/360 mainframes running the Real Time Computer Complex means that the computers that process the incoming telemetry data for the flight controllers will be taken offline for a few minutes.
164:30:39 Roosa: Okay. I can just write them down for you.
164:30:59 McCandless: Say, Stu, you'd better hold off on actually making the mark. We want to get the shaft and trunnion angles off of the displays also.
While the optical system has telemetry sensors
164:31:10 Roosa: Okay. I'll just stand by 1; no problem.
164:31:14 McCandless: Okay. And we're back in business, Stu. You can press on.
164:31:19 Roosa: Well, that was good timing.
This is Apollo Control at 164 hours 32 minutes. Our Retrofire Officer has just recommended to the Flight Director and - that we perform midcourse correction number 5. The rationale for doing it at this time, even though it is a very small midcourse - on the order of 7 tenths of a foot per second, is that it appears that doing a midcourse correction at the opportunity presented at midcourse 5 reduces the possibility that midcourses will be required at the 6 and 7 opportunities. At the present time, the spacecraft is on a projectory which would give it an entry interface angle of about 6.97 degress minus 6.97 degrees. This is within the corridor. It is within slightly on the steep side and one of the things the Flight Dynamics Officer and the Retrofire Officer considered in making the decision was the effect of the venting, particularly the venting associated...
164:33:05 McCandless: Ed, this is Houston. If you have a minute, we'd like to get the High Gain Antenna pointing angles tweaked up for maximum signal strength. We're showing about a Pitch of minus 60 and a Yaw of 0 as being appropriate. Over.
164:33:29 McCandless: You got it, Stu?
An addition to minimizing the possibility that we'll have to do a midcourse correction at the 6 and 7 opportunities performing the midcourse correction number 5, which will be the first midcourse on the trans-Earth leg of the flight, puts the spacecraft closer towards the center of the entry corridor and this maneuver will require about a 2 to 3 second burn on two of the RCS Reaction Control System quads.
164:36:32 McCandless: Got it, Stu?
164:38:11 McCandless: We got it, Stu.
Long comm break.
Stu Roosa is continuing to take marks on star sightings as part of the midcourse correction - midcourse navigation being performed onboard the spacecraft at this time and we're observing those marks that he's taking and recording them here on the ground. As Bruce McCandless, the CapCom, gets the data recorded, he's advising Roosa that he's got it, so that Roosa doesn't leave the data up any longer than necessary down here and can proceed on with the next step. We are planning to do midcourse correction number 5. That maneuver occurs in the Flight Plan at about 166 hours, 15 minutes, it is not time critical particularly. However at this time it looks as if it will be done pretty much according to the Flight Plan. At the present time we show Apollo 14 at 179,673 nautical miles from Earth, and the spacecraft's velocity of now 3,542 feet per second. At 164 hours 50 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston.
164:45:40 McCandless: We got it, Stu.
164:48:24 McCandless: We've got it, Stu.
Comm break.
164:50:00 McCandless: We've got that one also, Stu.
164:57:47 McCandless: Okay, we got it.
164:59:52 McCandless: Okay, we got it.
Long comm break.
165:10:44 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. We copied the last Noun 49 value there. And, for Stu's information, based on the sightings taken on the first three stars, we're showing that the program and the marks are all working out in excellent fashion within 1 sigma of the expected values. From the trench comes the information that your state vector compared with their estimate without any midcourse corrections, which show you arriving at entry interface 4 minutes earlier than the MSFN vector, at the present time. Over.
165:11:25 Roosa: Okay, we'll see what - if we can work on that 4 minutes.
165:11:28 McCandless: Roger.
165:11:29 Roosa: And we're going to be playing around here with the program a little bit.
165:11:33 McCandless: Okay. And, when you're through with that and prior to starting your maneuver to the thermal attitude, we'd like to go through a normal acquisition procedure on the High Gain Antenna, hopefully winding up in Auto and Narrow Beam Width to verify its tracking capabilities during the maneuver. Over.
165:11:57 Mitchell: Okay, Bruce. Say again when you want to do this.
165:12:01 McCandless: Roger. When Stu's through with his P23 and prior to starting the maneuver to thermal attitude that you've got called out - oh, at about 164:55, Verb 49, maneuver to thermal attitude. Over.
165:12:17 Mitchell: Okay. Will do.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 165 hours 14 minutes. CapCom at this time is preparing to pass up the information to the crew for midcourse correction numberfive. At its present time Apollo 14 is 178,831 nautical miles from Earth, at a velocity 3,557 feet per second. The on board navigation performed by Stu Roosa updating the spacecraft guidance system's knowledge of where it is, is used as part of a backup procedure, in the event that we were not able for some reason to use the computed values for midcourse corrections. Determined here on the ground. The crew would be able to compute maneuvers based on the on board guidance system. And as you heard in the conversation between Roosa and CapCom Bruce McCandless, the onboard values are comparing quite closely, with those that we have computed here on the ground.
Distance from Earth, 331,195 km, velocity, 1,084.2 m/s.
165:18:34 McCandless: 14, Houston. If you want to sit there in P00 and Accept for a minute, we've got the target load and state vector update for you.
165:18:47 Roosa: Okay. We're P00 and Accept. I guess we're going to do midcourse 5, huh.
165:18:53 McCandless: Roger. Sorry about that. Yes, we will burn midcourse 5 as scheduled. And I've got the midcourse 5 PAD for you whenever you're ready to copy.
165:19:06 Roosa: Okay. Stand by 1.
165:19:55 Mitchell: Houston, Apollo 14. Ready to copy it.
165:19:58 McCandless: Roger, Ed. Midcourse correction number 5; RCS/G&N; 24561; pitch and yaw trim, N/A.

High Gain angles in this attitude: Pitch, minus 90; Yaw, plus 206. Read back over.
165:22:00 Mitchell: Give again the jets to use, please, sir.
165:22:04 McCandless: Jets Bravo and Delta, B and D. Over.
165:22:11 Mitchell: Okay. Okay, midcourse 5; RCS/G&N; 24561; N/A, N/A; at 166:14:58.54; plus 0000.7, minus all zips, minus all zips; 092, 330, 009; N/A, plus 0018.9, 0000.7, 0:03, 0000.7; 33, 256.3, 13.5; N/A; minus 27.03, minus 172.62, 1158.8, 36251; 216:28:03; Sirius and Rigel; 230, 170, 002; plus-X, two jet, B and D. High Gain Antenna angles: Pitch, minus 90; Yaw, 206.
The PAD is interpreted as follows:
Purpose: This is a midcourse correction to fine tune their trans-Earth trajectory for a desired landing.
Systems: The burn would be made using the RCS quads in the Service Module and under the control of the Guidance and Navigation system.
CSM Weight (Noun 47): 24,561 pounds (11,141 kg).
Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48): N/A. These angles would represent an initial direction for the gimbal-mounted SPS engine, and are usually part of the PAD. However, they are not relevant for an RCS burn.
Time of ignition, TIG (Noun 33): 166 hours, 14 minutes, 58.54 seconds.
Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s): X, +0.7 (+0.2); Y, -0; Z, -0. The change in velocity is resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the local vertical.
Spacecraft attitude: Roll, 92°; Pitch, 330°; Yaw, 9°. The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform.
HA, expected apogee of resulting orbit (Noun 44): Not applicable in this context.
HP, expected perigee of resulting orbit (Noun 44): 18.9 nautical miles (35.0 km). This low value for the trajectory's perigee implies that the spacecraft will enter the atmosphere and will therefore slow down and, in the Command Module's case, reach the surface.
Delta-VT: 0.7 fps (0.2 m/s). This is the total change in velocity the spacecraft would experience and is a vector sum of the three components given above.
Burn duration or burn time: 3 seconds.
Delta-VC: 0000.7 fps. Using its ability to independently measure acceleration, the EMS can shut down the burn in case the G&N system fails to do so. This figure, Delta-VC, is intended for the EMS Delta-V counter, hence its name. If the burn is being carried out by the SPS engine, the value for Delta-VC will be smaller than that for Delta-VT to take account of the engine's tail-off thrust. Such a tail-off thrust is not an issue for the RCS thrusters so the value is the same.
Sextant star: Star 33 (Antares, Alpha Scorpii) visible in sextant when shaft and trunnion angles are 256.3° and 13.5° respectively. This is part of an attitude check.
Boresight star: Not applicable. This would be a second attitude check made by sighting on another celestial object with the COAS (Crew Optical Alignment Sight).
The next five parameters all relate to re-entry, during which an important milestone is when atmospheric drag on the spacecraft imparts a deceleration of 0.05g.
Expected splashdown point (Noun 61): 27.03° south, 172.62° west;
Range to go from the 0.05g event: 1,158.8 nautical miles (2,146.1 km). To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance, in nautical miles, that the CM would travel after the EMS is triggered by the 0.05g event. This number would be entered into a counter and would be decremented during re-entry based on data from the EMS's own accelerometer.
Expected velocity at the 0.05g event: 36,251 fps (11,049 m/s). This is another number used to initialise the EMS. It is entered into the Delta-V counter.
Time of the 0.05g event: 216 hours, 28 minutes, 3 seconds GET. This is the predicted time at which the spacecraft's G&N system would be expected to measure one twentieth of a g.
GDC Align stars: The stars to be used for GDC Align purposes are Sirius and Rigel.
GDC Align angles: The align angles are roll, 230°; pitch, 170°; yaw, 2°.
The PAD includes additional notes. The crew is to perform the burn by firing the plus-X (downwards-facing) jets on Quads B and D. Pointing angles are given for the High Gain Antenna
165:23:37 McCandless: Roger. Readback is correct. And were you aware that you're now coming back on Wednesday instead of Tuesday?
165:23:48 Shepard: No, we haven't considered that fact. But I guess we'll make it up between the splashdown and Houston, right.
165:23:53 McCandless: (Laughter) Roger, Roger you. After the TEI burn, it looks like you're about 3 or 4 miles west of the jog in the international dateline, as it comes down through your splashdown area.
165:24:13 Mitchell: Okay.
165:24:37 McCandless: 14, Houston. The computer is yours. You can maneuver to the midcourse correction 5 attitude without going through the thermal attitude; that won't be required. And we would like to go through the normal Reacq procedure on the High Gain Antenna, prior to starting the maneuver, and see if it tracks. Over.
165:25:03 Mitchell: Okay. Will do.
165:25:06 McCandless: And, for Stu, we've got two minor corrections to the procedures for the heat-flow experiment, as found in the back of the Flight Plan.
165:25:19 Roosa: I don't believe it. Stand by 1.
165:25:48 Roosa: Okay, I have the procedures out, Bruce.
165:25:50 McCandless: Okay. On the heat-flow and convec - convection demonstration, under step 2 was zone low, power on. It currently reads 15 minutes. Turns out that all that's required here is 10 minutes. Over.
165:26:12 Roosa: That's easy. Okay, under step 2, zone low, power on, 10 minutes.
165:26:18 McCandless: Roger. And down there under step 4, zone high, power on, it's now 10 minutes, and you can reduce that to 5 minutes.
165:26:32 Roosa: Okay, 5 minutes under step 4.
165:26:35 McCandless: Roger. And there's no problem involved in these. It just appears that the color changes in the crystals will saturate at about this time, so rather than using up more power, we can just shut it off at that point. Over.
165:26:53 Mitchell: Bruce, we lost you there for a minute. Let me read you right and understand exactly what you want me to do, ... go ahead and lock on and Reacq, and medium or ...
165:27:08 McCandless: Negative, Ed. We want you to go through a normal manual acquisition procedure, winding up in Auto and Narrow, over.
165:27:20 Mitchell: Okay. But I'm already on the High Gain right now so I .. .
165:27:26 McCandless: Okay. Then we're showing you minus 109 dB, so we must have lost you on the High Gain there, or you pointed off when you started the maneuver.
165:27:41 Mitchell: * * ?
165:28:14 McCandless: Okay, Ed. What we want you to do is to go to Auto and Wide Beam Width, and acquire us on the antenna; and then progressively narrow it down from Wide to Medium to Narrow. Over.
165:28:28 Mitchell: Okay. Thank you. You have it.
165:28:37 McCandless: Beautiful. I guess this is a semantics problem here, Ed. The INCOs have been using the terminology of standard acquisition to LMPly pointing the antenna towards the Earth manually, then going to Auto and Wide, getting it to lock up, and then on down into Narrow BEAM to complete the acquisition. Over.
165:29:10 Mitchell (onboard): Roger. That's what I understand as a normal acquisition, hut I - I thought I heard the word Reacq a couple of times, implying a position of the antenna, and I was confused on that one.
165:29:10 Mitchell: Roger. That's what I understand as a normal acquisition, but I thought I heard the word Reacq a couple of times LMPlying a position of the antenna, and I was confused on that one.
165:29:23 McCandless: Negative. That wasn't our intent.
165:29:28 Mitchell: Okay, Houston.
165:29:37 McCandless: And, Stu, this is Houston. We'd like to remind you not to select P37 prior to the midcourse burn now that we've loaded the data for your burn from the ground. Over.
165:29:55 Roosa: Okay.
165:30:06 McCandless: 14, Houston. You reported to us earlier that the weight of the ISA as determined on the lunar surface prior to lift-off was 50 pounds. If, In your opinion, this weight has changed to greater than 55 pounds as a result of the LM return to CSM stowage, then we'll have to make provisions for tying it down. We'd like to get your feel for what the current weight on the ISA is. Over.
165:30:49 Mitchell: Roger, Bruce. We'11 tell you it weighs exactly 54.9.
165:30:55 McCandless: Okay, Ed. We copy 54.9 for the ISA.
165:31:50 Mitchell: Houston, 14.
165:31:52 McCandless: Go ahead, 14.
165:31:56 Mitchell: A clarification on the ISA, remember now, there are a few program things that are listed in the Flight Plan that went into it after it was weighed. Are you taking that into account?
165:32:12 McCandless: Roger. We got the weight at 50 pounds from the lunar surface and can add in, if you like, down here those things. We were just interested in getting your feel for what had all been put in. And, if so, what the - what the weight increase would be.
165:32:33 Mitchell: Okay, Bruce. This - The things that are in the Flight Plan to go into the ISA were added in as programed. And any additional items are almost negligible in weight and certain - certainly did not violate your 5-pound criterion.
165:32:50 McCandless: Okay. Thank you, Ed.
165:33:11 McCandless: And if you're interested, we've got the morning's news items here.
165:33:29 McCandless: Or, alternatively, I've got some additional questions on the AOS for Ed.
165:33:38 Mitchell: Let's take the news first, and then the questions.
165:33:41 McCandless: Roger. Okay, 14. From Fra Mauro Base comes the word that ALSEP package number 4 continues to function normally during the reporting period, ending at 162 hours GET; the CPLEE heater was turned off; and a long period calibration of the PSE was performed. From West Fra Mauro comes the report that, when Antares augered in last night, the steerable antenna was still locked on, sending back high bit rate telemetry in fine tradition. "Anchorage, Alaska - -
165:34:30 Mitchell: It had to do something to redeem itself.
165:34:35 McCandless: - - "Anchorage, Alaska - An Earthquake measuring between 6.5 and 6.7 on the Ritcher Scale occurred near Adak in the Aleutian Islands Saturday, but no damage or injuries were reported. The seismograph-ic station in Berkeley, California, recorded the quake at 150 plus 14 GET, and scientists said it occurred close to the Earth's surface. The Alaska State Patrol said the trembler [sic] was centered south of Adak but was not severe enough to call for large wave warnings." "Stockholm - An Italian and a Norwegian-born Swede plan to repeat the 1909 North Polar Expedition of American Explorer, Admiral Robert E. Perry, right down to fur garments' and sleighs. Some of the Eskimo guides even claim to be descendents of Perry's original Eskimo crew." "Moberly, Missouri - -
165:35:36 Mitchell: Lots of luck on that one.
165:35:38 McCandless: - - "Moberly, Missouri - A radio station of Moberly has tried a number of times to place a telephone call to Alan Shepard on the Moon. One operator said, 'The Moon? Really? Do you have a number and area code?' Another took it in stride, said, 'All right.' The newsman asked how long it would take, and the operator replied she didn't know; and he was discouraged when, after asking if he could wait, the operator replied 'Okay.' Many operators laughed, but one ended the fun with a rejoiner 'Sir, there are no connections for civilians to the Moon at this time. We are sorry.'" "George C. Scott and Ali McGraw have been honored - -
165:36:20 Mitchell: And that was the call Al was waiting for, too,
165:36:28 McCandless: - - "George C. Scott and Ali McGraw have been honored as best actor and actress in the Foreign Press Association's 28th Annual Golden Globe Presentations in Beverly Hills, California. Miss McGraw received her award for her part in 'Love Story.' Scott was selected for his part as General George Patton in 'Patton.'" "Houston - At the River Oaks Country Club, golf pro Jack Arden was quoted in this morning's paper as saying that, 'Al has got a pretty good swing and could be a real good player if he worked at it.'" Along that line in the other golf news, Arnold Palmer, Tom Shore, and Dewitt Weaver are all tied for first place in The Hawaiian Open with scores of 204. That was after a third round yesterday, and a final round is to be played today.
At the upcoming 43rd Academy Awards held on April 15, 1971, George C. Scott was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor, but refused to receive it. Ali McGraw was nominated for Best Actress, losing out to Glenda Jackson.
165:37:27 Mitchell: The only way Al can keep his arm straight, though, is to wear the suit, and that gets cumbersome on the golf course.
165:37:35 McCandless: Roger that. "The Houston Astros have passed the halfway point in signing on new players for the 1971 season. Signed contracts have come in from 23 of the 43 players who are scheduled to see spring training action. Regulars, such as pitchers Don Wilson and Tom Griffin, catcher John Edwards, and infielders Denis Menke and Bob Watson, and outfielder Norm Miller are already signed up. Also, the Astros have commitments from both their newest acquisitions from the Chicago Cubs, infielder Roger Metzger and catcher/first baseman Jack Hiatt." "New Mexico's Governor Bruce King and his predecessor David Cargo are in a dispute over who owns the Moon rocks presented to Cargo by President Nixon. Cargo took them when he left office December 31- King said he has asked the former Governor to return them back because, 'I think they belong to the State.'" "Charlotte Amalie (St. Thomas), Virgin Islands - the U.S. Virgin Islands is planning a permanent ocean-floor laboratory in Great Lamasher Bay, St. John, to provide a low-cost method of charting the untracked jungles of the world's oceans. The habitat, a large tubular twin-chamber cylinder, will be modeled after the one used in the recent Tektite Program and be financed by the Virgin Islands Government and private industry. The Navy says its first rescue minisub has shown it can locate a submarine trapped under water, lock onto it, and bring its crew to safety. The rescue vessel proved itself in test at a depth of more than 150 feet off San Clemente Island. The 50-foot sub located a metal structure representing a submarine, locked a transfer hatch over it, and brought a man through. They've dubbed the vessel 'the green torpedo.'" On the basketball scene, UCLA put the skids on USC in the big west coast basketball game last night. In a come-from-behind victory, the Bruins edged the Trojans 64 to 60. The Houston Cougars had a real battle with Seattle University at the Hofheinz Pavilion last night. They squeezed out a 93 to 92 win. In the Southwest Conference action, the Rice Owls dumped the Texas Tech Raiders by 80 to 64. Rice, smarting from a three-game losing streak, stopped the Raiders' three-game winning streak. Tech is number - Tech is 4-2 for the season; Rice, 3 and 3. In automobile racing, A. J. Foyt showed his driving prowess by winning the pole position for the big Daytona 500 on February 14. Foyt wowed the crowd as he turned in a qualifying lap time over the 2-and-one-half-mile oval with a clocking of 182.7-Defending stock car champion Bobby Isaac was second with a speed of 180.5 per hour. Foyt, who has never won the Daytona 500, is the favorite now with Isaac to win the 200,000 dollar auto classic. Former U.S. Davis Cupper Arthur Ashe defeated Clark Graebner of New York in the semifinals of the Fidelity invitational tennis tournament in Richmond, Virginia. And that about wraps up the morning news. Over.?
The New Mexico Moon rock was eventually placed into a museum.
The Tektite Program was funded by NASA to place an underwater habitat onto the seafloor, which not only advanced underwater science but also acted as a spaceflight analogue by being a remote, isolated, high tech environment. The earlier similarly minded SEALAB project had Mercury astronaut Scott Carpenter among the ranks of its crew.
The minisub mentioned here is more than likely the US Navy "Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle", or DSRV, also known as the Mystic class. Built by Lockheed and utilizing space age technology, these submersibles could dock with downed nuclear submarines and rescue their crew. Although never used in a real rescue operation, they have fascinated fiction writers and moviemakers for the past 50 years, making appearances in movies such as 'The Hunt for Red October'.
Arthur Ashe (1943-1993), the pioneering African American tennis player, would yet go on to win three Grand Slam titles, including Wimbledon in 1975.
165:41:24 Shepard: That's a very good rundown, Bruce. Very good. Why don't you let us hold off on the answer on the ISA for a minute? We'll run back over our checkout list and review those items while you're probably doing the same thing down there, and we'11 get back together with you a little bit later in the day on a good wave.
165:41:45 McCandless: Roger. There's certainly no rush on it. We'd just like to know, at - prior to entry, so that we can determine whether it needs to be tied down or not, and if it affects the c.g. any.
165:41:57 Shepard: Okay. We think the additional items are about 5 pounds; and let us go back over the checklist, and we'll give you a good answer later on.
165:42:03 McCandless: Roger. And when Ed feels in the mood for it, I've got a couple more questions for the AGS.
165:42:12 Shepard: Fire away.
-
165:42:30 Mitchell: Go ahead, Bruce; I'm ready.
165:42:48 McCandless: Okay, Ed. When the trouble first showed up, was there anything showing or was there anything left showing in the DEDA? And was it possible for you to clear this display, if there was anything showing? Over.
165:43:07 Mitchell: That's negative. The first time I noticed that there was a problem was when you called my attention to it, that - I don't recall what - don't remember what the call was - but you asked about the - I guess the circuit breakers on the DEDA or on the AGS. That was the first time I ever realized that we had a problem. There was nothing showing on the DSKY. And, of course, I could not ENTER the DSKY or CLEAR it or anything else.
165:43:37 McCandless: Okay. I guess that about sums it up.
165:43:43 Mitchell: There is one comment. I noticed, just before leaving the LM, there appeared to be a very small crack across the address register on the DEDA. Now, how long it had been there, whether it was bumped after docking, or when it occurred, I have no idea. But there did appear to be a crack in the inner glass on the address register.
165:44:17 McCandless: Okay. Thank you.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 165 hours 45 minutes. The information passed up to the crew on that series of transmissions for a midcourse correction number 5 called for a burn at 166 hours 14 minutes 58 seconds, that will have a velocity change effect of 7 feet per second in the plus extra action, which will be back toward the center of the Earth in the direction of travel of the spacecraft. It will require a burn time of about 3 seconds, using two of the Reaction Control System thrusters. At 2 p.m. this afternoon central standard time, Dr. Brian J. O'Brien, the principal investigator for the charged particle lunar environment experiment on the Apollo 14 ALSEP and Dr. Gary Latham, principal investigator for the passive seismic experiment will meet with newsmen in the large auditorium of the MSC News Center. That - will be at 2 pm this afternoon central standard time.
165:51:51 McCandless: 14, this is Houston, On your waste water dump scheduled for 166 hours, we'd like you to dump to 25 percent onboard indication. Over.
165:52:06 Mitchell: Roger. Waste water dump to 25 percent onboard indication.
165:52:10 McCandless: Roger.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 165 hours 55 minutes. We're now a little less than 20 minutes away from the scheduled ignition for a midcourse correction number 5. A primary purpose of that maneuver will be to place the spacecraft a little closer to the middle of the entry corridor. It is within the entry corridor at the present time. Without the midcourse correction, the entry interface angle would be about negative 6.97 degrees. The desired angle of entry interface is 6.5 degrees, again negative. And this maneuver will be aimed primarily towards putting the entry interface angle at the desired 6 - negative 6-1/2 degrees. The burn will be performed at 166 hours 14 minutes 58 seconds. It will be a 7 tenths foot per second maneuver using the Reaction Control System thrusters burning for about 3 seconds on two of the four quads. And at the present time, we show Apollo 14 177,361 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a velocity of 3,582 feet per second.
165:58:14 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. For systems recordkeeping purposes, if you have time, we'd like you to run an EMS null bias check, and give us the results on it.
165:58:29 Shepard: Houston, I think we have that number. Stand by.
165:58:32 Mitchell: Okay, minus 990 is the number.
165:58:35 McCandless: Roger. We copy minus 990.
Long comm break.
166:04:06 McCandless: 14, Houston. We'd like to get this waste-water dump out of the way before the midcourse burn. Over.
166:04:14 Shepard: Roger. We'll start it right now.
166:09:10 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. We show oxygen still flowing in the fuel cell purge.
166:09:24 Mitchell: It's Off.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We're coming up now on 1 minute until our midcourse correction maneuver. This will be a seven-tenths of a foot per second burn using the Reaction Control System thrusters on the spacecraft.
166:14:09 McCandless: 14, this is Houston; 1 minute to the burn. We'd like you to terminate the water dump at this time, and go ahead and ENTER on your maneuver there.
166:14:18 Mitchell: Okay, we'll be there.
166:14:57 McCandless: Your slip Tig is okay, 14.
166:15:03 Roosa: We're going to just go ahead and burn it on time.
166:15:06 McCandless: Okay.
166:16:26 Roosa: Okay, Houston; the burn is complete.
166:16:29 McCandless: Houston. Roger, out.
Comm break.
Flight dynamics and guidance officers report that they are happy with that burn. Telemetry data here on the ground showed that residuals in all three axes were less than one-tenth of a foot per second. It'll be several hours before we have sufficient tracking to determine the precise effects of that midcourse correction, desired effect would be to move the entry interface angle from 6.97 degrees to a minus 6.50 degrees putting the spacecraft in the center of the entry corridor. In deciding to perform the midcourse correction at the midcourse correction 5 opportunity the flight dynamics and retro fire officers pointed out that it would minimize the possibility of having to do midcourse corrections at the opportunities 6 and 7. And the decision was made in part on that basis to go ahead with the midcourse correction at seven-tenths of a foot per second midcourse correction at this opportunity. At...
166:19:30 Roosa: Houston, 14.
166:19:34 McCandless: Go ahead, 14.
166:19:38 Roosa: Okay, Bruce. I started this maneuver at optics CAL; I don't know if we'll have the High Gain there or not. Do you want to do the uplinking here? I kind of hate to stop the maneuver. Is Omni Charlie going to be all right for you for the uplink?
166:19:55 McCandless: That?s affirmative, Houston - 14.
166:19:59 Roosa: Okay, thank you.
Comm break.
166:22:13 McCandless: Apollo.
166:22:22 Shepard: Go ahead, Houston.
166:22:27 McCandless: All right, 14; this is Houston. Could you give us the reading on the Delta-V counter on the EMS at the end of your burn, again, for systems tracking? Over.
166:22:54 Mitchell: That was 0.3; plus 0.3.
166:22:56 McCandless: Roger. Plus 0.3. Thank you.

This is Apollo Control. Preliminary tracking from that midcourse correction maneuver shows that we've moved the spacecraft a little closer towards the center ofthe entry corridor we're now reading minus 6.63 degrees and we would expect that number to continue to change as we gather more tracking information. Based on the same preliminary information entry interface would occur at 216 hours, 27 minutes, 31 seconds which would give us a splashdown time of approximately 216 hours, 53 minutes. Again these times will change as we continue to gather more tracking information, probably by relatively small amounts. At 166 hours, 25 minutes we show Apollo 14 traveling at a velocity of 3,600 feet per second, now 176,357 nautical miles from Earth.
Velocity is now reading and their distance from Earth is .

166:50:32 Mitchell: Roger. Stand by.
166:51:23 McCandless: I understand you're ready to copy, Ed. Over.
166:51:32 Mitchell: Stand by.
166:51:49 Mitchell: Okay, Bruce. What page do you want worked on?
166:51:55 McCandless: Okay. If you look on page 3-245 of the Flight Plan, the one that starts at 168 hours.
166:52:05 Mitchell: Okay.
166:52:07 McCandless: Okay. There are three steps there, that are: circuit breaker O2 Isolation/Aux Bat, close, which is panel 226; O2 Tank 3 Isolation valve, Closed, momentary; and O2 Tank 3 Isolation valve talk back barberpole. We'd like to move those three steps up to 167 hours. Over.
166:52:46 Mitchell: Okay. The three steps: circuit breaker O2 Isolation/Aux Bat, closed; O2 Tank 3 ISOL valve, Closed, momentary; and O2 Tank 3 ISOL valve talkback barberpole. These are moved to 167 hours.
166:53:02 McCandless: Roger. And, also, at 167 hours: circuit breaker Oxygen Tank 3, 50-Watt Heaters, open, 226. Over.
166:53:27 Mitchell: Okay. Say it again, want you want done with that one.
166:53:31 McCandless: Okay. Also, at 167 hours, we want to open the circuit breaker for Oxygen Tank Number 3, 50-Watt Heaters. That's CB O2 Tank 3, 50-Watt Heaters, open, on Panel 226. Over.
166:54:00 Mitchell: Okay. You want the Tank 3 - O2 Tank 3, 50-Watt Heaters, Open.
166:54:09 McCandless: That's affirmative. You may commence the O2 high-flow tests at your convenience, following Stu's completion of the P23. Over.
166:54:22 Mitchell: I understand.
166:54:24 McCandless: Item number 3. The new heater redline temperature is 350 degrees Fahrenheit - that's 350 degrees Fahrenheit, which corresponds to 3-6. I say again - 3.6 volts on the Systems Test Meter. Over
166:55:08 Mitchell: Bruce, say again what the 350 degrees of redline is.
166:55:13 McCandless: Roger, that's the redline on the heater temperature . Over.
166:55:19 Mitchell: Okay.
166:55:21 McCandless: And that corresponds to 3-6 volts on the Systems Test Meter.
166:55:30 Mitchell: Thank you.
166:56:00 McCandless: And, Ed; for tank 3, that's position 1 Charlie on the Systems Test Meter.
166:56:09 Mitchell: Okay, thank you.
166:56:13 McCandless: Okay. Some general comments, the test should be terminated if communications is lost with MSFN. Over.
166:56:27 Mitchell: Understand. You mean - you mean other than just a dropout.
166:56:33 McCandless: That's affirmative. If we lose communication for any extended period of time.
166:56:45 Mitchell: Okay.
166:56:47 McCandless: And, for your information, the minimum cabin pressure that we are expecting is in the vicinity of 4.4 to 4.2 psia. However, if the cabin pressure falls below 4.0 psia, you should terminate the test. Over.
166:57:12 Mitchell: Okay. Understand you're expecting 4,2 to 4.4 cabin pressure; if it drops below 4.0, we're to terminate the test.
166:57:20 McCandless: Roger. And if you're unable to terminate more rapidly than is required to keep the cabin pressure above 3.T, then bring the surge tank and the Repress back on line to maintain cabin pressure. Over.
166:57:37 Mitchell: Okay.
166:57:53 McCandless: Okay, Ed; and, on the Systems Test Meter, make that position 1 Bravo, for monitoring tank 3, which is the one that you should be monitoring. Over.
166:58:07 Mitchell: Okay; 1 Bravo, tank 3.
166:58:13 McCandless: And, then, here's a fairly long one. If tank 3 heater temperature, or tank 1, exceeds 350 degrees Fahrenheit, place the heater switch to Off. I'll go all the way through this once, first. When the pressure drops to 800 psi, place heater switch to On. Monitor tank pressure and heater temperature. Place heater switch to Off when pressure reaches 930 or heater temp reaches 350, whichever occurs first. Test will be terminated if heater temp reaches 350 prior to tank pressure reaching 850 in this mode of operation. And - I'll go right back and start again from the beginning on that one in a minute. Over.
166:59:07 Mitchell: Okay. Let's see if we can find a way to codify it so that it'll be a little easier to understand.
166:59:20 McCandless: Okay, condition number 1. If the heater temperature exceeds 350 degrees, put the heater switch to Off. Over.
166:59:38 Mitchell: Okay. If the heater in tank 3 exceeds 350, heaters to Off.
166:59:50 McCandless: Okay. Under the assumption, then, that you're up in a normal operating pressure range when this happens, when the pressure drops - -
166:59:59 Mitchell: Bruce, hold up a minute.
167:00:00 McCandless: Okay.
167:00:04 Mitchell: Hold up a minute. Let's let Stu complete this P23, and then we'll get back on this. I'm interfering with him by working on the Flight Plan right now.
167:00:12 McCandless: Okay; tell you what. Just carry out that stuff at 167 hours, and then, whenever you're ready to press on with this, give us a yell, and we'll go back through the rest of these notes. Over.
167:00:43 Mitchell: Okay.
167:00:56 McCandless: 14, Ed; this is Houston. Since we?ve already given you the instructions to terminate the test if communications is lost, it might be more straight forward if we monitored the heater temps and pressures for you down here and advised you of the action required, if any off-nominal action is required . Over.
167:01:23 Mitchell: Okay; that'll be fine.
167:01:25 McCandless: Roger; then you've got - you got all of it up there now; and if for any reason you should have to terminate, why, the procedures are over there on page 3-248; they're the nominal termination procedures .
167:01:43 Mitchell: Okay, Bruce; will do.

This is Apollo Control at 116, 167 hours 13 minutes. The crew on Apollo 14 at this time taking another set of marks and sightings for midcourse navigation. When this activity is completted, then they're scheduled to begin the high oxygen flow rate test. In this test a dump valve in the spacecraft will be opened to increase the oxygen flow rate from the current level of about 1 tenth of a pound per hour to about 6 lbs per hour. This is the sort of situation that would be encountered on an EVA, and one of the purposes of the test is to verify that oxygen flow rates, which could be encountered in subsequent Apollo missions during EVA's, will not exceed the delivery capibilities of the tanks. To determine that the Service Module cryogenic oxygen tanks will be able to deliver oxygen at a high flow rate, particularly later in the missions when, later in the mission when quantities in the tanks are down, and at the present time, the quantity in Tank 3 which will be used to supply the high flow rate, is down to about 21 percent. Apollo 14 at this time is 174,632 nautical miles from Earth and the spacecraft velocity 3,630 feet per second.
167:20:03 McCandless: Come on, now.
167:20:08 Shepard: All right; go ahead, Houston.
167:20:12 McCandless: I was just remarking at Stu's Noun 49 value there, plus one-tenth zero.
167:20:22 Shepard: Well, you're watching the world's leading expert on P23.
167:20:27 McCandless: Well, I don't know. Jack Swigert wrote a paper on it.
167:20:33 Shepard: We're aware of that, also. Comment still stands.
167:20:40 Roosa: Yes, that has nothing to do with Al's comment, Bruce.
167:20:45 McCandless: Okay, I'll pass that along.

This is Apollo Control at 168 hours, 2 minutes. The crew aboard Apollo 14 appears to have completed the Program 23 midcourse navigation, we'll be standing by now for them to begin the high oxygen flow rate test. Essentially this test will involve opening a valve on the spacecraft, increasing the oxygen flow rate from the current level of about one tenth of a pound - one tenth of a pound per hour, to about six pounds per hour. The primary purpose of the test will be to determine the ability of the Service Module cryogenic oxygen system to deliver oxygen at a high flow rate such as will be required during in flight EVAs, and future Apollo missions. And particularly when the oxygen level in the tanks is at a - a low level. At the present time the oxygen tank three which will be providing the source of oxygen for the high flow rate test, the quantity is down to about 21 percent. At the present time Apollo 14 is 172,918 nautical miles [320,244 km] from Earth. The spacecraft velocity is 3,662 feet per second [1,116 m/s].
168:08:39 Mitchell: Houston, Apollo 14.

168:15:38 McCandless: Okay. We continue to get praise of your ability on the P23s. Based on your navigation, your idea of your gamma angle at entry interface is minus 6.1 degrees. The MSFN solution corrected for the midcourse 5 burn, but without any post-midcourse tracking is 6.6 degrees. Over.
168:16:09 Roosa: Okay. Yes, I noticed - I was comparing a Verb 83 there, Bruce; and I showed 625 miles, or thereabouts, prior to those last two sightings; and then, it was down to - I don't know 100 and some - after that. I think the sightings on the Moon is what really help bring it in. There were a couple of large updates there, I think, that really helped it.
168:16:39 McCandless: Okay. That sounds like you're doing good work.
168:16:46 Roosa: Thank you.
168:17:07 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. On telemetry, we're showing a cabin pressure of 4.7 right now and wonder what you've got?

This is Apollo Control at 168 hours 32 minutes. We've been in this oxygen flow rate test now for about 20 minutes. The spacecraft cabin pressure is down to 4.5 pounds per square inch and appears to be leveling off there. The test is scheduled to last for about 3½ hours. Also the Flight Dynamics Officer and Return to Earth Officer have computed some additional information on the result of the midcourse correction performed at the MCC-5 opportunity based on the preliminary tracking we would expect entry interface to occur at 216 hours 27 minutes 34 seconds with a splashdown at 216 hours 41 minutes 35 seconds and the preliminary splashdown coordinates are 27 degrees 2 minutes south, 172 degrees 38 minutes west which is about 8 minutes west of the international date line and would still at this time put the splashdown, local time on Wednesday. Of course, the Greenwich mean time for splashdown would remain the same. And there's also a good possibility that with additional tracking as the tracking vectors are updated with additional information, that we'll find the splashdown point moving back to the other side of the international date line and giving us that Tuesday, local time splashdown. At the present time we show Apollo 14 171,822 nautical miles from Earth and the spacecraft velocity 3,682 feet per second. Flight Director Milton Windler just checking with his EECOM now -- on the status of the spacecraft cabin pressure and EECOM reports that it appears to be leveling off at that 4½ pound per square inch pressure. At 168 hours 34 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 169 hours 2 minutes. Oxygen tank number 3 appears to be doing a credible job of maintaining a high flow rate. We're still steady at 4.5 pounds per square inch cabin pressure. The nominal, with a normal flow rate of about 1 tenth of a pound per hour is up around 5 pounds per square inch. Once we initiated the high flow rate opening a valve in the spacecraft to increase the flow rate over board, the pressure in the cabin drops to about 4.5 and it's been holding there ever since. The test has been in progress now for about, a little under 1 hour.
169:02:37 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. We'd like you to zero the optics, please.
169:02:49 Shepard: Okay; stand by. Okay, you've got it.

This is Apollo Control at 169 hours 33 minutes. Apollo 14 now traveling at a velocity of 3,722 feet per second and 169,688 nautical miles from Earth. The high oxygen flow rate test has been in progress now, for a little over an hour and 20 minutes, and we're still showing a stable cabin pressure at 4.5 pounds per square inch. The oxygen flow rate tests are scheduled to continue for a total of about 3 and one half hours, or up to about 171 hours, 10 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The test, however, was begun at about 168 hours 9 minutes and could run a little bit beyond the 171 hours. This is Apollo Control, the cabin pressure is maintaining at about 4 and a half pounds per square inch, however we do show a drop at this time in the manifold pressure which supplies the cabin. This has been a gradual steady decrease in the manifold pressure, and at this time the EECOM is evaluating whether or not to terminate the flow rate test. Flight Director Milton Wendler has gotten the recommendation that we will terminate the test at this time, and Capcom Bruce McCandless is preparing to pass that recommendation to the crew.
169:38:43 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
169:38:50 Shepard: Go ahead, Houston.
169:38:52 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. We're showing an O2 manifold pressure of 8 pounds per square inch absolute, and we'd like to terminate the O2 high-flow test at this time. Further procedures found in your Flight Plan opposite 171 hours 00 minutes GET, deleting the 10-minute step in there - deleting the 10-minute restriction in there. Over.
169:39:19 Shepard: Okay. At 171 hours, we ... through termination procedures; got you.
169:39:25 McCandless: Roger.
Long comm break.
Our telemetry data shows that the crew has put the surge tank on the line, part of the normal test termination procedure and we should show the cabin pressure start to come back up from 4.5 pounds per square inch to something closer to the normal flow rate of around 5 pounds per square inch.
169:44:06 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. We show the surge tank on line and the manifold pressure back up in the normal operating range, and we'd appreciate it if you'd advise us when you have the orifice closed off. Over.
169:44:22 Mitchell: Roger. It's closed off, now.
169:44:25 McCandless: Roger. Thank you.
169:44:28 Mitchell: Bruce, what was the reason for terminating the test? I didn't quite understand it.
169:44:34 McCandless: Okay. The pressure in the O2 manifold, which normally is regulated 85 to 110, got down to 9 psia; and the pressure in your water tanks was falling off from below its regulated range because of the pressure in the manifold. And we just thought it best to terminate the test at this time and reexamine the data that we've got on the plumbing leading down to it, and we'll be back to you with some info on it later. Over.
169:45:09 Mitchell: Okay, we understand. Thank you.
169:46:44 Mitchell: Houston, 14.
169:46:47 McCandless: Go ahead, 14.
169:46:52 Mitchell: Do you want us to stay in this attitude, or shall we go on to the thermal attitude?
169:46:59 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. Remain in the present attitude until 171 plus 30, and then maneuver to the thermal attitude. Over.
169:47:10 Mitchell: Okay, and what about the isolating of the tank? Do you want to go ahead with those three steps , or do you want to hold off on those?
169:47:42 McCandless: Stand by on that, Ed. We'll have the answer for you in a minute.
169:48:02 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. Affirmative. Press on with the tank 3 isolation valve opening. Over.

This is Apollo Control at 170 hours, 5 minutes. The spacecraft cabin pressure is back up now to about 4.8 pounds per square inch. Continuing to increase gradually towards the normal 5 to 6 pounds. The high 02 flow rate test which began at 168 hours, 9 minutes, and 50 seconds when Al Shepard announced that the plug was out or the valve had been opened to increase the flow rate through the cabin from normal 1 tenth of a pound per square inch that we had been seeing to that point to about 6 pounds per square inch. And at 168 hours, 30 seconds the surge tank pressure dropped down to about 750 pounds per square inch, which is the criterian for beginning the 2½ hour time on the flow rate. Normally the test would have been concluded 2½ hours after the surge tank pressure had dropped to 750 pounds per square inch. However, the test was terminated and at 169 hours, 38 minutes, 40 seconds or after a little more than 1 hour, 8 minutes we finally noticed that the manifold pressure, which supplies the cabin, had dropped from the normal 85 pounds or so to about 8 or 9 pounds. The cabin pressure at all times stayed steady at about 4½ pounds, which is about what was expected. At this time the preliminary indication is that the flow rate may in fact have been greater than the system could reasonably be expected to provide coupled with the dump rate and use of the urine dump system by the crew is in fact, the flow rate, which was demanded of the system was greater than could reasonably be expected. The manifold pressure would in fact drop, giving us the indication that we saw. The cryogenic system throughout the period ofthe test that was conducted did appear to be providing an adequate flow rate to maintain cabin pressure at 4½ pounds per square inch. And there'll be additional engineering evaluation of the detailed data that was collected during the test in determining whether the test accomplished its objectives or not despite the early termination. At the present time Apollo 14 is 168,405 nautical miles from Earth. And the velocity continuing to increase slowly. Now up to 3,747 feet per second.
170:11:40 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
170:11:45 Mitchell: Go ahead. Houston.
170:11:47 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. Back when you all were running that P37 about an hour ago, we took your state vector and ran it through our computer here; and we got excellent agreement between the two solutions. We both showed a 0.9-foot per second midcourse, and the entry interface times were within 1 second of each other. The reduction here shows that the measurement plane error in the star sighting's themselves was less than 3-arc minutes. So, it's really looking beautiful.
170:12:23 Mitchell: Three-arc minutes, huh?
170:12:25 McCandless: Right.
170:12:26 Mitchell: Well, that's very good, Bruce. Thank you.
170:12:29 McCandless: And, with respect to the O2 high-flow test, the feeling down here is that low pressure in the manifold was probably connected with some panel 251 activity, giving a higher flow rate. And if Stu's around, we'd like to discuss for a minute his plans on the demonstrations. Over.
Panel 251 contains controls for the overhead dump for the waste management system, implying that the combined flow of oxygen out of the spacecraft from the hatch adapter for the test and the waste drain was more than the oxygen system could handle.
170:12:52 Mitchell: Okay. He's here. Just a minute; we'll put him on.
170:15:31 Roosa: Houston, 14.
170:15:34 McCandless: Okay, Stu. We wanted to just get a status report on the demos, if you've'been doing any work on them on the way home, here, and see what your plans were for the TV show this evening.
170:15:51 Roosa: Okay. Why don't you give us about an hour on that; I'm just in and out. We've been running some of the metal composites, but that - that's nothing to do with TV; all we're going to do there is just show the experiment and talk a little about it. And when you called, I was putting up the heat-flow experiment. We're going to take a look at that one and the liquid transfer and get a hand on it. So, I'll have some word In about an hour.
170:16:21 McCandless: Okay. We're standing by for the TV at the regular time; and if you could tell us which ones of the metal casting that you've already run, why it might be of interest to people down here. We caught number 4 on the way out.
170:16:38 Roosa: Yes. We've run 4, 5, 6; and 7 will be the next one.
170:16:39 McCandless: Roger.
Comm break.
170:19:39 Shepard: Houston, Apollo 14.
170:19:45 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
170:19:51 Shepard: Just to clarify a point. We're still planning on starting the TV show at 172:30. Is that correct?
170:19:57 McCandless: That's affirmative.
170:20:01 Shepard: Okay. Thank you.
Very long comm break.
170:41:43 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. Over.
170:41:49 Shepard: Go ahead, Houston.
170:41:51 McCandless: Okay. We'd like to confirm that you did, in fact, turn the heaters and oxygen tank number 1 off for the continuation of our O2 low-flow test here.
170:42:13 Shepard: We're working on a 50-pound instrument error on that. I think we're reading about 865 right now. How do you look?
170:42:24 McCandless: Okay. We're reading a little higher down here. Got about 889 showing on the TM.
170:42:33 Shepard: Okay. That's fine. We'll turn it off now.
170:42:36 McCandless: Okay; Roger. And for Ed, the folks in Kingston Court wanted me to say hi.
170:42:52 Shepard: Understand you want Ed on the line.
170:42:54 McCandless: No, just pass that on to him, and you might remind Stu to listen to his music.
170:43:03 Shepard: Yes. We - we're listening to the music.
170:43:07 McCandless: Okay.
170:44:07 Mitchell: Houston, 14. This is Ed. Did you call me?
170:44:11 McCandless: Ed, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
170:44:16 Mitchell: Roger. Did you call me?
170:44:18 McCandless: I just wanted to say that the folks in Kingston Court said to say "Hello." They'll - -
170:44:24 Mitchell: Thanks, Bruce. Appreciate that.
170:44:27 McCandless: They'll be watching during the TV demonstration here.
170:44:33 Mitchell: Very good. We're - getting the camera out right now, as a matter of fact.
170:44:39 McCandless: Okay.
Very long comm break.
PAO This is Apollo Control at 170 hours 51 minutes. We're in the midst of a shift handover in Mission Control at this time and Flight Director Gerry Griffin coming on to replace Flight Director Milton Windler. The Capsule Communicator on the coming shift will be astronaut Gordon Fullerton. And at the present time, we show Apollo 14 traveling at a speed of 3,777 feet per second [1,151 m/s], now 166,832 nautical miles [308,973 km] from Earth. There will be a Change of Shift Press Briefing. We estimate that it will begin in the MSC News Center in about 15 to 20 minutes.
Distance from Earth is km, and velocity is m/s.
171:12:50 Fullerton: Apollo 14, Houston. Over.
171:12:56 Mitchell/Shepard: Go ahead, Houston.
171:12:58 Fullerton: Ed, if you have a couple of minutes, we have a short test we'd like to run on the High Gain Antenna to answer the questions - some questions that the antenna people have and try to tie down a couple of questions that are still in their mind about it.
171:13:18 Mitchell: Okay.
171:13:20 Fullerton: Okay. What we'd like you to do is set the dials to Pitch of plus 25 and Yaw, plus 265, and then go to Manual and Wide and then switch to the Primary High Gain Servo Electronics and try to make a normal reacquisition on the Primary Electronics and hopefully, if it's working, we'll wind up - once you acquire backup in Auto and Narrow. If you have any problems and it won't work properly, just go back to Secondary Electronics and back essentially in the mode you are in now. They want a - one final check on whether Primary Electronics had indeed failed or not. Over.
171:14:19 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
171:14:19 Mitchell: Okay.
171:14:43 Mitchell (onboard): Houston, 14.
171:14:43 Mitchell: Houston, 14.
171:14:45 Fullerton: Go ahead.
171:14:49 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. It seems to have popped right up very nicely this time.
171:14:49 Mitchell: Okay. It seems to have popped right up very nicely this time.
171:14:54 Fullerton: That's in Primary, right?
171:14:57 Mitchell (onboard): That's affirm.
171:14:57 Mitchell: That's firm.
171:14:59 Fullerton: Okay. We'd like to just stay in Primary then, please.
171:15:04 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
171:15:04 Mitchell: Okay.
171:15:15 Shepard (onboard): Ed, where's a pair of scissors? Never mind.
171:15:21 Fullerton: Okay, Ed. That's really all they had to ask you to do. If you have any sort of failure in Auto Track and Primary, then go back to Secondary. Over.
171:15:39 Mitchell: Wilco.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We're going to take down the air to ground line at this time for the Change of Shift Press Briefing now about to begin in Building 1 small briefing room. We'll record on tape any air to ground communications that take place during the press conference and bring the line up live after conclusion of the press conference. At 171 20 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
171:37:39 Slayton: Apollo 14, Houston.
171:37:43 Shepard: Go ahead, Houston.
171:37:44 Slayton: Yes, how's your health up there today?
171:37:51 Shepard: Oh, we're just fine, Deke. Everybody's in great shape. We had a little sleep last night. Everybody's a little bit tired after 2 full days, but we're fine now. And we're making preparations to run the TV show here. We're playing with the experiments a little bit ahead of time to get organized. And we're just going along fine.
This is Apollo Control at 171:38 Ground Elapsed Time. We've got some accumulated tape during the press conference, and we'll play catch up with the tape and go live.
171:38:11 Slayton: Outstanding. You guys did a beautiful job and you sound great.
171:38:16 Slayton: We've got one...
171:38:17 Shepard: Okay, thank you very much, Deke.
171:38:20 Slayton: ...we've got one quick question here. Wanted to know how you feel at this point about doing that Q and A with the press tomorrow?
171:38:32 Shepard: Sounds good to us. No problems at all with that.
171:38:35 Slayton: Okay, real fine. Well we're looking...
171:38:37 Shepard: I think we ought to work out a time - I think we ought to try to work out a time somewhere in the timeline when it's convenient for everybody: the people on the ground and for us also.
171:38:48 Slayton: Okay, well Flight thinks about 195:30 looks like a good time from all respects down here.
171:38:56 Shepard: About 195:30?
171:38:58 Slayton: Roger.
171:38:59 Shepard: Stand by.
171:39:48 Shepard: Looks pretty good to us Deke. That's good spot in the timeline from our point of view, also.
171:39:54 Slayton: Okay, real fine. And they'd like to have TV with that. That gives us good coverage out of Goldstone for that.
171:40:03 Shepard: Okay, we'll plan on that, then.
171:40:07 Slayton: Okay, great, Al.
171:40:11 Shepard: You sound pretty good yourself. How's your sleep level these days?
171:40:16 Slayton: Well, I gained on you last night. I picked up about 12 hours.
171:40:22 Shepard: Ho ho ho.
171:40:26 Slayton: Talked to your bride today and saw her yesterday. Everybody's doing great family-wise.
171:40:32 Shepard: That's good. Thank you, sir.
Deke is being very cheeky here. Al and his wife Louise have been married since 1945, going 26 years by the time of Apollo 14.
171:40:34 Slayton: You bet.
Long comm break.
171:51:27 Fullerton: Apollo 14, Houston. Over.
171:51:31 Shepard: Go ahead.
171:51:33 Fullerton: We'd like to have you go to the thermal attitude as shown at 171:20 in the Flight Plan. Over.
171:51:44 Shepard: Wilco.
Very long comm break.
172:09:57 Mitchell: Houston, 14.
172:10:02 Fullerton: Go ahead, Ed.
172:10:06 Mitchell: The Flight Plan showing a Narrow Deadband. Is a Wide-band Deadband good enough right now?
172:10:11 Fullerton: Stand by.
172:10:33 Fullerton: A Wide Deadband will be good.
172:10:38 Mitchell: Roger, thank you.
172:10:39 Shepard: Okay, Stu ... now.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, 172:15 Ground Elapsed Time. Some 15 minutes away from the television transmission of the inflight demonstrations from Apollo 14, which are sort of a scientific show and tell. The zero gravity in flight demonstrations involve several pieces of equipment, time lapse photography, and other techniques, for investigation of how weightlessness affects various types of fluids, gases. Among these demonstrations are electrophoretic separation, heat flow and convection, liquid transfer and composite casting. In the electrophoretic separation demonstration could lead ultimately to a method for processing and manufacturing new vaccines and other biological preparations on manned space stations. Only a small portion of the total time involved in these demonstrations can be shown in the TV transmission tonight, because many of the investigations take an hour or more to completely run. The heat flow and convection demonstration is aimed at showing how various types of fluids and gases will flow in weightlessness. This particular demonstration will be photographed at 1 frame a second with the motion picture camera in a time lapse technique. It will be photographed for a total of an hour and 28 minutes. The liquid transfer demonstration looks into the effects and benefits of having baffles inside of tanks. In zero G the fluids tend to cling to the sides of tanks and it is thought with adequate baffling or slosh plates inside of tanks, this particular phenomenon can be off set.
In the composite casting demonstration, metal alloy with a very low melting point will be used to get a handle on how materials, not only metals but composites would chop fibers, or wire stiffning inside the composite casting would behave from a manufacturing stand point. 18 sealed capsules containing these materials will be placed in a heater and allowed to cool and brought back to Earth for examination. We're still up live on the Apollo 14 air ground loop. About 10 minutes away now from the television. At 172:20 this is Apollo Control.
172:18:38 Fullerton: Apollo 14, Houston. We're ready for you to terminate the charge on battery B.
172:18:48 Roosa: Okay, terminating B at this time.
172:18:51 Fullerton: Roger.
