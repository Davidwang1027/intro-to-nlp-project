With the crew asleep, Apollo 14 is falling back to Earth with an ever increasing velocity. Everything is proceeding normally, and both the crew and Mission Control can look forward to a safe return home.
Editor's note: All transcript times are presented according to the GET update at 054:53:36 that saw the mission timer moved forward 40 minutes, 2.90 seconds.
This is Apollo Control; 201 hours, 21 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. No word from the spacecraft in the last hour. They've shut down their transmitter switch and are settled down in Passive Thermal Control or barbeque roll for the night. Here in the control room, workmen are respacing the plaques from previous missions along the upper right wall in the control room in preparation for tomorrow's splashdown, when it's a tradition for the Flight Director to climb up a tall step ladder and hang the plaque from the mission just completed. And right now Apollo 14 is 82,236 nautical miles [152,301 km] out from Earth, approaching at a velocity of 6,387 feet per second [1,947 m/s]. And at 201 hours 22 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 202 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. According to the Flight surgeon the crew of Apollo 14 is soundly asleep at this time. Anticipating a shift handover in about an hour here in the Control Center to the Orange Team of flight controllers headed up by Pete Frank. Apollo 14 79,109 nautical miles [146,510 km] out from Earth. Velocity increasing, now 6,545 feet per second [1,995 m/s]. 202 hours, 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control, out.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 203 hours, 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Our displays at Mission Control presently show Apollo 14 at a distance of 75,308 nautical miles away from the Earth and now traveling at a velocity of 6,749 feet per second. The crew of Apollo 14 of course, in their rest period as they have been for some time. Meanwhile in Mission Control, the orange team of flight controllers are now manning their positions. Flight director Pete Frank, presently going around the room at this time checking on status with each member of his flight control team. The atmosphere at this time in the control center is quiet, subdued and planning ahead for the entry activities, now some 13 hours 14 minutes away. We're at 203 hours and 13 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 204 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 14 is presently 71,370 nautical miles away from the Earth and traveling at a speed of 6974.6 feet per second. The crew of Apollo 14 continuing with their rest period. Our clock shows 3 hours 47 minutes remaining. Meanwhile, the report from weather on what may be expected in the primary recovery area is particularly comforting. We show cloud cover of 2000 feet scattered to broken, 10 miles visibility, winds from an easterly direction 100 degrees at a velocity of 17 knots, sea state of 4 feet - 4 foot waves, On our entry plots we show a range from entry to splash of 1,220 nautical miles and witb a predicted point of splash at 172 degrees 39 minutes west, 27 degrees 1 minute south. We're at 2 hours - 204 hours 13 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 205 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Our display in mission control presently shows the spacecraft, Apollo 14, at a distance of 67,278 nautical miles out from Earth, and now traveling at a speed of 7,225 feet per second. Very. little activity in the mission control center during the past hour. In addition to monitoring Apollo 14 spacecraft systems, members of the orange flight control team also had the opportunity to watch a rerun of last night's televised crew news conference from space. We're at 205 minutes 13 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, and our clock shows 2 hours 47 minutes from time of crew wakeup. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 206 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 14 now at a distance of 63,068 nautical miles away from the Earth, now traveling at a velocity of 7508 feet per second. We show 1 hours 47 minutes until time of crew wakeup. Ten hours 15 minutes until time of reentry into the Earths' atmosphere. We're presently logging an entry interface time of 216 hours 27 minutes 47 seconds. From entry on in in terms of retro elapse time of preliminary numbers now showing on one of our displays at the console, we show reaching 05g at plus 29 seconds. Blackout should begin shortly before that at plus 18 seconds. Blackout ending at 3 minutes 36 seconds. Droque deployment, drogue shoot deployment at 8 hours - or 8 minutes 3 seconds. Main shoot deployment 8 minutes 51 seconds. And, this would give a landing for Apollo 14 at 13 minutes 48 seconds. These numbers, of course, will be refined and updated as Apollo 14 continues on its path toward the Earth. We're at 206 hours 14 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, and this is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 207 hours 14 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We're some 45 minutes away now according to our clock from that time at which the crew of Apollo 14 will be wakened - awakened. Meanwhile, in the Mission Control Center, a decision has not yet been made as to whether or not midcourse correction number 7 will be performed. Flight director Pete Frank expects this decision to be made at about 210 hours Ground Elapsed Time. About 7 hours ago the science staff support room in the Mission Control Center observed and recorded some activity on the passive seismic instruments for the Apollo 12 and 14 experiments. We presently show Apollo 14 at a distance of 58 444 nautical miles away from Earth and traveling at a velocity of 7,845 feet per second. We're at 207 hours 15 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 207 hours and 59 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We presently show Apollo 14 at a distance of 55,100 nautical miles away from the Earth and traveling now at a speed of 8 113 feet per second. The crew of Apollo 14 should be receiving their wake up call shortly. Our CapCom for today or for this shift is Astronaut Fred Haise. Haise will be the individual in the Control Center making that call. At 208 hours Ground Elapsed Time, standing by continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control Houston.
208:01:17 Haise: Hello, 14; Houston.
208:01:46 Mitchell: Houston, Apollo 14. Good morning, Freddo.
208:01:50 Haise: Good morning, Ed. Down the home stretch. I show you're about 55 grand out, now. I got a few things here for you, if you got a Flight Plan handy.
208:02:06 Mitchell: Okay. Let me get some lights on first, Fred.
208:02:10 Haise: Okay.
208:03:28 Mitchell: Okay, Freddo; go ahead with your updates.
208:03:33 Haise: Okay, first we got a consumables update; GET of 208 hours; 44.0; quad A, 44.9; B, 41.0; C, 45.7; and D, 44.4; H2 tank 1, 30.7; and 2, 29.2; O2 tank 1, 63.3; 2, 65.0; 3 is 10.9; and why don't you go ahead with that readback - if you want, Ed - first.
208:04:33 Mitchell: Okay. 208.00; 44, RCS total; quads, 44.9, 41.0, 45.7, 44.4; hydrogen, [garble] .7, 29.2; oxygen, [garble], [garble], 10.9.
208:04:58 Haise: Okay. Stand by 1.
208:05:21 Haise: Okay, 14; how do you read now? We had to get the VOGAs off the line.
208:05:27 Mitchell: Okay. Loud and clear, Freddo.
208:05:29 Haise: Yes, you're good now. Right to the left of the consumables update block, there's a Verb 29 maneuver to the optics CAL attitude at about 208:30; and your High Gain angles there should - should be Pitch, minus 73; and the Yaw number there should be .102.
208:06:04 Mitchell: Okay. That's corrected. Thank you. 102.
208:06:08 Haise: Okay - and let's see - we'd like the potty tank inlet valve to close, so we can get a little more water into the waste tank.
208:06:26 Mitchell: Okay, I'll do that right now.
Comm break.
208:08:14 Haise: And, 14; Houston. You still there?
208:08:19 Mitchell: That's affirm, and the potty tank's closed off.
208:08:23 Haise: Okay, Ed. Let's see. They'd like here the readouts that you have there for the onboard Pitch and Yaw S-band meters. And also the dials.
208:08:47 Mitchell: Okay - at this moment, you mean?
208:08:50 Haise: That's affirm, Ed.
208:08:56 Mitchell: Yes. It looks like at this moment, they're setting at - plus 60 and 360. And the thumbwheels are sitting at minus 52 and 270.
High Gain Antenna controls on Panel 3.
208:09:18 Haise: Okay, copied, Ed.
Apollo Control Houston 208 hours and 9 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Our readout on the onboard computer shows that Apollo 14 is now having a platform, computer platform alignment underway per the Flight Plan. We presently show 14 at a distance of 64,247 nautical miles away from the Earth traveling...
208:10:16 Haise: And, 14; Houston.
208:10:25 Mitchell: Go ahead, Fred.
208:10:26 Haise: Okay, we've got that number 3 tank down low enough now; so, hereafter - just in case you're wondering we'll keep tanks - O2 TANKs 1 and 2 in Auto, and we'll leave Tank number 3 , Off, O-F-F.
208:10:45 Mitchell: Okay. That's my current, configuration, and I understand it will stay that way.
208:10:50 Haise: Roger, Ed. And we've got the torque angles okay.
208:10:59 Mitchell: Okay.
208:11:04 Haise: And let's see, 14; one other note here they missed - says they missed getting a presleep medication report - and from that I assume you didn't have any medication. Is that correct?
208:11:18 Mitchell: That's a good assumption.
208:11:20 Haise: Okay.
208:11:30 Haise: Okay, 14. I've got one other thing which concerns verifying where you've got some stowage, and it's not too time-critical - so, if you want to - go ahead and get cleaned up first and just give me a call when you want to talk about that.
208:11:47 Mitchell: Okay. .
208:11:53 Mitchell: Got anything that's outstanding we owe you right now, Freddo - like checklist...
208:11:59 Haise: No, I think we've got everything taken care of except finding out for sure where you got all the bags.
208:12:03 Mitchell: Okay. Well, right now,, we don't have them all - we don't have them all stowed, but we know exactly where we're going to put them, and we'll be starting that before long.
208:12:18 Haise: Okay.
Apollo Control, Houston, 208 hours, 13 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 14 now traveling 8,202 feet per second, now at a distance of 54,028 nautical miles away from the Earth. We'll stand by continuing to monitor.
208:14:41 Mitchell: Houston, 14. Freddo, did you get the Noun 93s pertaining to [garble]?
208:14:47 Haise: That's affirm, 14. We got those.
208:14:51 Mitchell: Okay, the time we're using is 208:11:05.
208:14:54 Haise: Roger; 208:11:05.
Long comm break.
208:19:34 Mitchell: Houston, 14.
208:19:38 Haise: Go ahead, 14.
208:19:41 Mitchell: Okay. Postsleep report. On sleep, Al and Stu had 4 hours each; I had 6. On the PRD, Al is 16062; Ed, 07060.
208:20:04 Haise: Okay. Copied sleep report - or postsleep report; 4, 4, and 6 hours, with you getting the 6, and I copied the other numbers - dosimeters.
208:20:20 Mitchell: Roger. And I was the one on the headset, too.
The crew took turns with one sleeping with the communications headset, so that he could alerted to any calls from Houston.
That's Ed Mitchell reporting that Al Shepard, Stu Roosa both have a 4-hour sleep while he got 6 hours sleep.
208:20:45 Haise: Hey, are you reading, Ed?
208:20:51 Mitchell: Go ahead.
208:20:54 Haise: Hey, you can tell Stu I watched the press conference, and I hope he didn't let all the lunar fines out there.
208:21:04 Mitchell: He did a pretty good job of letting part of them.
208:21:08 Haise: Yes, I could see that.
208:21:09 Roosa: [Garble], Fred?
208:21:13 Mitchell: We've got it all cleaned up now, though.
208:21:17 Haise: Okay.
208:21:18 Roosa: We don't have any dust in here, Fred. You can see that.
Long comm break.
208:27:57 Haise: And, 14; Houston. We'd like the high gain cranked up when you get at it there.
Apollo Control, Houston, at 208 hours and 28 minutes. A read out of Apollo 14's computer shows it in program 23. Stu Roosa...
208:28:06 Mitchell: Okay, Freddo. Stand by 1.
208:28:36 Roosa: And you got her, Freddo.
208:28:39 Haise: Okay. Thank you. .
Very long comm break.
Stu Roosa apparently performing the cislunar navigation program, that's his midcourse navigation. 208 hours and 29 minutes Apollo 14 52,756 nautical miles away from Earth, velocity 8,314 feet per second.
Distance to go is 97,704 km and velocity is 2,534.1 m/s.
208 hours 33 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, taking a look at the onboard display keyboard, Apollo 14 continuing in program 23, doing midcourse navigation by incorporation of the star/Earth and star/Moon optical measurements. 208 hours 34 minutes, 52,375 nautical miles away from Earth, Apollo 14 traveling at 8,347 feet per second. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
In the four minutes since the previous PAO call, their distance has decreased to 96,999 km and their velocity increased by a notch to 2,544.2 m/s.
Apollo Control, Houston, 209 hours - 03 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We presently show Apollo 14 50,014 nautical miles away from the Earth, traveling at a speed of 8,564 feet per second. We've had no conversation with the crew of Apollo 14 recently. However, our ground displays of the onboard computer show that program 23, the midcourse navigation program is still in progress.
209:07:09 Haise: Not bad, Stu.
209:07:13 Roosa: Well, I'm not sure whether It's good or bad, Fred. I think we probably need some update. That doesn't help me much.
209:07:30 Haise: Well, Dave here says you're looking pretty close.
209:07:49 Haise: Or maybe it's like the old saying, even the blind squirrel finds a nut, now and then.
209:07:58 Roosa: Hey, you're just all heart this morning, Freddo.
That's our CapCom, Fred Haise, critiquing the...
209:08:08 Haise: Didn't want you overconfident.
...critiquing the midcourse navigation program. The Dave referred to is Dave Reed here in Mission Control. Dave is a Flight Dynamics Officer.
209:08:29 Haise: And, Stu, Dave wonders if you want to proceed from here, maybe, and look at the Delta-Vs and P37, and he'll compare with you.
209:08:42 Roosa: Okay. We might try that, depending on the time here; still a little stowage I want to get on.
209:08:50 Haise: Okay.
Very long comm break.
Stu Roosa aboard Apollo 14 as Command Module Pilot. He has been performing the P23 into the computer. We're at 209 hours 09 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 14 49,541 nautical miles away from the Earth, traveling now at a speed of 8,611 feet per second. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
209:26:56 Haise: 14, Houston.
209:26:59 Shepard: Go ahead.
209:27:01 Haise: Hey, just thought Stu would be interested. After his last sets of marks there, we have his gamma, now, down to within about 0.05 degrees; and altitude, against ours, about - within 4/10ths of a mile.
209:27:21 Shepard: I knew he would get a little bit better with his marks.
Very long comm break.
Apollo - Apollo Control Houston. 209 hours 34 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We presently show 14 at a distance of 47,493 nautical miles away from the Earth. Velocity now reading 8,813 feet per second. At present we are looking for a decision or Go/NO Go for the midcourse correction number seven. At 209 hours - 210 hours 30 minutes, Ground Elapsed Time. This is Apollo Control Houston.
209:47:27 Mitchell: Houston, 14,
209:47:31 Haise: Go ahead, 14.
209:47:35 Mitchell: Freddo, we're starting into getting these bags stowed in here. You said you had a storage update for us - [garble] we have.
209:47:45 Haise: I'm not sure it's an update, Ed. You may have already gotten the word, but there was a conflict in a note that RETRO had on one of them. And it indicated maybe you had put it in a different spot. And...
209:48:03 Mitchell: [Garble] I don't knew which one you're referring to, but go ahead and let's hear it.
209:48:11 Haise: Okay. I'll just read - there's only three items -three items; and one says that the 30-pound bag will be put on A-13, the 20-pound bag on A-8, and Stu's suit with the helmet and a sleeping bag will be on top of the - also on top of A-8.
209:48:42 Mitchell: Okay. Stand by just a minute.
209:48:53 Mitchell: Freddo, we were putting the 20-pounder on A-8 with the suit on top of it. Is that the way you want it now?
209:49:00 Haise: That's correct.
209:49:03 Mitchell: Okay. That's the way we're going.
209:49:05 Haise: Very good.
Long comm break.
210:00:12 Haise: 14, Houston.
210:00:15 Mitchell: Go ahead, Houston.
210:00:18 Haise: Okay, Ed. Would you verify the Fans, Off?
210:00:24 Mitchell: Stand by, Freddo.
210:00:43 Mitchell: Okay, they're Off now.
210:00:45 Haise: Roger, Ed.
Comm break.
210:04:25 Haise: 14, Houston.
210:04:28 Mitchell: Go ahead, Freddo.
210:04:30 Haise: Okay. You all can crank the carousel up there anytime. And before you do, we'd like you to check the S-BAND Pitch knob at minus 40, Yaw at 90, Reacq, and we'd like Medium Beam width now.
210:04:56 Mitchell: Okay. You want minus 40, 90, Reacq, and we're ready to spin up.
210:05:01 Haise: Okay. And that was Medium Beam width, Ed.
210:05:05 Mitchell: Roger. Medium Beam width.
Very long comm break.
Apollo Control Houston. 210 hours 5 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 14 now 44,832 nautical miles away from the Earth. Now traveling at a speed of 9,000 - 9,100 feet per second. In his last conversation with Apollo 14, Fred Haise advised Ed Mitchell the Lunar Module pilot that Apollo 14 could proceed with their manuever to a passive thermal control latitude. We are at 210 hours 6 minutes Ground Elapsed Time continuing to monitor. This is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 210 hours, 24 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. At present we show Apollo 14 43,200 nautical miles away from Earth, velocity now reads 9,276 feet per second.
210:34:03 Haise: 14, Houston.
210:34:08 Mitchell: Go ahead, Houston.
210:34:10 Haise: Okay. We won't be needing MCC-7.
210:34:16 Mitchell: Roger. Said no MC-7 - MCC-7- Thank you, Freddo.
210:34:20 Haise: [Garble].
Long comm break.
Apollo Control, Houston. That was CapCom Fred Haise advising Apollo 14 that Midcourse Correction 7 will not be required. We're presently looking at entry angle of 6.38 degrees. The present coordinants for splash 27. - 27 degrees .02 minutes South, 172 degrees, 40 minutes West. Velocity at time of entry interface is presently seen as 36,170 feet per second and range to go from entry interface, 1225 nautical miles. The max g expected, 6-1/4. We're at 210 hours, 36 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We now show Apollo 14 at 42,302 nautical miles from Earth and traveling at a velocity of 9,391 feet per second. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
210:45:26 Mitchell: Houston, Apollo 14.
210:45:30 Haise: Go ahead, 14.
210:45:34 Mitchell: Let me give you Command Module RCS injector valve Temps.
210:45:40 Haise: Okay. Go ahead, Ed.
210:45:42 Mitchell: Okay. Systems Test Meter: 5 Charlie, 4.4; 5 Delta, 5.1; 6 Alpha, 4.5; Bravo, 4.4; Coco, 4.4; and Delta, 4.5.
210:46:01 Haise: Okay. We've got them in.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 210 hours 47 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We presently show Apollo 14 at a distance of 41,209 nautical miles away from Earth and traveling at a velocity of 9,512 feet per second. At 1402 Greenwich mean time, it was the first observation of the Mission Control Center was made of what later turned out to be the effects of the Los Angeles Earthquake. Stations at Honeysuckle, Hawaii, Guam, and Carnarvon had communications affected. We lost various combinations of voice and data circuit for periods ranging from 1 minute to as much as 5 minutes. However, by using data from alternate stations, and the alternate stations in this case, Honeysuckle and Carnarvon, the Mission Control Center was never without full capability. These circuits have been either cleared or rerouted by the telephone company and Mission Control Center, Houston is now in normal capability. We are at 210 hours 48 minutes and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
Underwater cables are used to connect the majority of the Manned Spaceflight Network stations together and into their central communications post at Goddard Space Center in Maryland. The Pacific Ocean side of the network has been partially disabled for some time due to a powerful earthquake in the Los Angeles area, where the Pacific side cabling comes ashore.
This is Apollo Control at 210 hours 58 minutes. In Mission Control at this time we're completing the shift handover. Flight Director Milton Windler and his Maroon Team of Flight Controllers is replacing the Orange Team headed by Flight Director, Pete Frank. At the present time Flight Director is reviewing the mission status with each of his flight controllers, that's before coming on shift this morning. The Maroon Team met in one of the staff support rooms here to review all of the procedures which will be followed during entry both for a normal entry into a number of contingency situations which could conceivably arise, and at the present time Apollo 14 is 40,126 nautical miles from Earth. The velocity of the spacecraft up now to 9,647 feet per second. There will be no change of shift briefing this morning.
This is Apollo Control at 211 hours 10 minutes. Our Flight Director, Milton Windler has completed his status review with flight controllers here in the control center, and everything appears to be in good shape. for today's entry. The network controller reports that the - all of our ground length circuits around Los Angeles have been by-passed, we are - we do have alternates circuits around Los Angeles and at the present time I have full primary capabilities and the network controller reports that we do have some loss of back-up circuits but that all of our prime circuits are functioning at this time. A midcourse correction seven has been dropped there will be no midcourse correction at - at midcourse opportunity which was to have occurred about 213 hours 27 minutes. This will give the crew a bit of added time will also allow us to get some of the update to them a bit earlier. Normally, until the last updates such as landing coordinate, and so on, are not passed up until after we've obtained some tracking following that midcourse correction. Without performing the mid course, of course the Flight Dynamics Officer, Return-to-Earth Officers, tracking data does not have to be updated, and they'll be able to get such things as the entry pass up to the crew a bit earlier than normal. We're currently showing Apollo 14 at an altitude of 38,936 nautical miles The velocity up now to 9,800 feet per second.
211:12:11 Mitchell: Houston, Apollo 14.
211:12:14 McCandless: Go ahead, -14. Over.
211:12:18 Mitchell: Hello, Bruce. Say, I thought I'd try to make the surgeon happy for the last 4 or 5 hours in the flight. Have him check my biomed now, please.
211:12:25 McCandless: Roger, Ed. Understand you'd like a biomed-harness integrity and telemetry check. Over.
211:12:32 Mitchell: That's affirmative.
211:12:34 McCandless: Okay. We'll get them going on it.
211:15:34 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. The Surgeon reports that they have good data on all crewmen, with the exception of Ed's respiration rate. The ZPN sensors are still not getting through on telemetry; however, don't worry about it at this time. They're happy with what they've got; and, medically, you're Go for entry. Over.
211:15:59 Mitchell: Okay. Well, I just replaced one sensor that had come loose. I thought maybe that was the one causing the problem.
211:16:06 McCandless: Okay. Right now, we're not getting your respiration rate. Which one did you - which one did you replace, Ed?
211:16:17 Mitchell: Actually, I replaced the top outer, not on the sternum, the one to the right.
211:16:26 McCandless: Okay. Understand the upper one on the right side of your chest, not on the sternum. Over.
211:16:32 Mitchell: That's affirm. And, on the respiration here, let's see if I can press them and get them coming in. Yes, tell them to watch it now.
211:16:44 McCandless: Okay. They're watching. All right.
211:17:49 McCandless: And, 14, this is Houston. When you select Omni Charlie, would you give us a call, so that we can send you a Command Reset? Over.
211:18:00 Mitchell: Okay. I was just getting ready to do that when you called. It's going in now.
211:18:03 McCandless: Roger. Thank you.
Comm break.
211:21:21 McCandless: 14, Ed; this is Houston. Over.
211:21:25 Mitchell: Go ahead, Houston.
211:21:26 McCandless: We have seen no change in your impedance pneumograph. We suspect that it may be a problem in the signal conditioner. And the Surgeons thank you for your efforts in attempting to restore the axillary leads, but suggest that you just leave it as is for entry and not bother with it any further. Over.
Biomedical harness.
211:21:48 Mitchell: Okay, I was pulling and tugging, and I'm convinced the sensor and harness is okay, Bruce. So, I agree with you; it must be somewhere down stream.
211:21:57 McCandless: Roger; the feeling is that it's probably in the signal conditioner.
211:23:01 Mitchell: Okay, tell them not to worry. I'll hold my breath; and then, they'll know what the rate is.
211:23:07 McCandless: Say, that sounds like a pretty good plan. Give us a mark when you start holding; and then, we'll time from there.
211:23:15 Mitchell: Okay.
211:23:17 McCandless: Either that, or the Surgeons say that if - if you give us a mark when you start holding your breath, we'll give you a mark when the EKG goes flat. Over
211:23:27 Mitchell: That's a fair enough exchange.
211:24:39 McCandless: 14, Houston. The information that you sent us down on the systems test meter leads us to cancel the Command Module RCS preheat, as you probably surmised by now. We just wanted to make sure we were both on the same frequency. Over.
211:24:54 Mitchell: Okay, we concur. Thank you, Bruce.
Very long comm break.
211:36:58 McCandless: Apollo 14, Stu. This is Houston.
211:37:02 Roosa: Go ahead.
211:37:03 McCandless: Roger. In looking at your Noun 49 values, we're scratching our heads on the magnitude of the Delta-R and the Delta-V updates. Would you verify that - the first star, you were, in fact, using the far horizon; and on this one, you are using the near horizon. Over.
211:37:22 Roosa: That's affirmative. I worried about that, too - at the size of them, Bruce. And I verify this one for sure on the near horizon; and you know, I'm 99 percent certain on - on the other one. I really didn't - I reshot and got that same large update, and thought it was pretty good, but I didn't see them taper down like they should have. I'm mystified, also.
211:37:48 McCandless: Okay. Well, we're not meaning to - to try and backseat drive. We're trying to figure it out for you, also; and we wanted to confirm that before we went too much further. Over.
211:37:58 Roosa: Okay.
Long comm break.
211:43:17 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. I have your reentry PAD whenever you're ready to copy. Over.
211:43:43 Mitchell: Okay, Houston. Ready to copy.
211:43:46 McCandless: Roger. And would you confirm that star 23 was loaded in P23 this time? It looked like 22 as it went by us.
211:43:56 Roosa: Roger; it was 22, Bruce. I went back on and checked that first star again, and I'm afraid that is the trouble - I shot the wrong horizon on the star 22.
211:44:29 Roosa: And, Bruce, would you suggest that I shoot that over again? See if we can take that error out?
211:44:50 McCandless: Stu, this is Houston. Go ahead and shoot star 22 over again, and we'll have some more detailed word for you on the sequence after that in a minute.
211:45:00 Roosa: Okay.
211:45:13 McCandless: And after reshooting star 22, Stu, you can press on to star 23; and there's no need to redo 64. Over.
211:45:22 Roosa: Okay.
211:45:27 McCandless: And, Ed, if you're ready, I've got the Entry PAD.
211:45:32 Mitchell: Okay. Let's copy.
211:45:34 McCandless: Roger. Entry: mid-Pacific area; roll at .05g: 000, 154, 000; 216:10:47; 267; minus 27.02, minus 172.65; Max g, 06.2; 36170, 6.39; 1140.2, 36251; RRT, 216:27:47; 00:29; Noun 69 is NA; D0, 4.00, 02:09; 00:18, 03:33, 08:07; sextant star, 30, 354.3, 30.7; boresight star, Nu Hydra, up 21.1, left 2.8, up lift vector. Comments: Use 1, nonexit EMS pattern; 2, Moon check, Moon in left of window: roll 000, 182, 000; 3, Moonset GET, 216 plus 25 plus 15. RET of 90,000 feet, 6 plus 29. Main deploy, 8 plus 54. Landing, 13 plus 52. Constant-g entry is roll right. GDC Align, 322, 325, 018. And for your information, the MSFN values of gamma at Entry Interface are minus 6.39, comparing with the navigated value prior to this last set of P23s of minus 6.42. The MSFN vacuum perigee, 20.6. Your onboard vacuum perigee, 20.1. And back under GDC Align, it's Sirius and Rigel for the stars. Read back. Over.
211:49:17 Mitchell: Okay, Bruce, we have a MIDPAC landing at zero - Roll, pitch, and yaw: 000, 154, 000; 216:10:47; 267; minus 27.02, minus 172.65; Max g is 06.2; 36170, 6.39; 1140.2, 36251; 216:27:47; 00:29; D0 is 4.00, 02:09; 00:18, 03:33, 08:07; sextant star, 30, 354.3, 30.7; Nu Hydra, up 21.1, left 2.8, lift vector, up. Use nonexit EMS pattern.
211:50:33 Mitchell: Okay, for the Moon-check attitude, it's in the left of the window; and we should be at roll 000, 182, 000; and Moonset is at 216:25:15. RET of 90 K is 06:29; mains are 08:54; landing's at 13:52. For constant-g, roll right. GDC Align stars are Sirius and Rigel, with angles of 322, 325, 0l8. The MSFN entry gamma is minus 6.39, onboard gamma, 6.42. HP is 20.6 and 20.1.
Two definitions are required to understand an Entry PAD. The first is Entry Interface, an arbitrary altitude of 400,000 feet or 121.92 kilometres. This is used for trajectory calculation. The second definition concerns the moment when the G&N system detects a deceleration of 0.05g. Its importance lies in the fact that it both triggers the computer control of re-entry, and it starts the Entry Monitor System that allows the crew to keep an eye on progress through the atmosphere.
The data passed up for the Entry PAD is interpreted as follows:
Purpose: Entry.
Landing target: The landing target is the Mid-Pacific Recovery Area.
IMU gimbal angles required for trim at 0.05g: Roll, 000°; pitch, 154°; yaw, 000°.
Time of the horizon check: 216 hours, 10 minutes, 47 seconds GET.
Spacecraft pitch at horizon check: 267°. This check is carried out 17 minutes prior to Entry Interface.
Splashdown point: 27.02° south latitude, 172.65° west longitude.
Maximum number of g's during entry: 6.2.
Velocity at Entry Interface (400,000 feet altitude): 36,170 feet/second (11,025 meters/second).
Entry flight path angle at Entry Interface: 6.39°.
Range to go to splashdown point from 0.05g event: 1,140.2 nautical miles. To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance the CM would travel from the 0.05 g event to landing. This figure will be decremented by the EMS based on signals from its own accelerometer.
Predicted inertial velocity at 0.05g event: 36,251 feet/second. This is another entry for the EMS. It is entered into the unit's Delta-V counter and will be decremented based on signals from its own accelerometer.
Time of Entry Interface: 216 hours, 27 minutes, 47 seconds GET.
Time from Entry Interface to 0.05g event: 00:29 (seconds).
Planned drag level (deceleration) during the constant g phase (D0): 4.00 g.
Time from Entry Interface until their velocity slows sufficiently to allow a circular orbit around the Earth: 02:09. The practical implication of this is that this is the "capture point" where the CM will no longer be able to skip off the atmosphere. Since the spacecraft will already be within the Earth's sensible atmosphere at this point, drag will continue to slow the spacecraft and the return to Earth is assured.
Time from Entry Interface that the communications blackout begins: 00:18 (seconds).
Time from Entry Interface that the communications blackout ends: 03:33 (minutes and seconds).
Time from Entry Interface that the drogue parachutes will deploy: 08:07 (minutes and seconds)
Sextant star: 30 (Menkent, Theta Centauri)
Sextant shaft angle at Entry Interface minus 2 minutes: 354.3°.
Sextant trunnion angle at Entry Interface minus 2 minutes: 30.7°.
The next three items refer to an attitude check made using the COAS sighted on a star two minutes before Entry Interface.
Boresight star: Nu Hydra.
Boresight Star pitch angle on COAS: Up 21.1°.
Boresight Star X position on COAS: Left 2.8°.
Lift vector at Entry Interface: Up. Since the direction of the lift vector is towards the crew's feet, they will re-enter in a heads-down attitude.
Further information pertaining to the reentry is given in the following notes:
They should use the scroll pattern in the EMS that relates to an entry that is not designed to exit the atmosphere for a period.
Mooncheck: Moon visible at the left of window. Moon viewing attitude roll, 0°; pitch, 182°; yaw, 0°
Moonset: 216:25:15 GET
Elapsed time at 90,000-ft altitude: 06:29 (mins/seconds)
Main parachute deployment time: 08:54 (mins/seconds)
Landing: 13:52 (mins/seconds)
Constant g reentry roll: Right.
GDC Align stars: The stars to be used for GDC align purposes are Sirius and Rigel.
GDC Align angles: Roll, 322°; pitch, 325°; yaw, 018°.
Small corrections to the Entry PAD will be read up in about 3½ hours time.
211:51:23 McCandless: Roger, 14. Readback correct. Out.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 211 hours, 54 minutes. At present time aboard Apollo 14 Command Module Pilot, Stu Roosa, is involved in midcourse navigation activity. Roosa is basically sighting the fixed line of sight of the spacecraft sextant on the Earth's horizon and centering the selected star in the movable line of sight of the sextant over the Earth's horizon and then taking a mark on this. The computer automatically reads the time and the angle between the star and the horizon, using this information to update the onboard knowledge of the spacecraft position and velocity. And, as you heard, in that last exchange between CapCom Bruce Mc Candless and Roosa prior to beginning this last set of navigation marks, the onboard readings were agreeing very closely with the ground computed values for such things as the angle of entry interface and the time of altitude of vacuum perigee. We've also passed up a preliminary set of numbers for entry to the crew. This will be updated probably about 1 hour prior to entry. We've seen very small changes in these numbers. A time of entry interface has remained unchanged, 216 hours, 27 minutes, 47 seconds. There have been some minor changes of a few seconds in some of the postentry events beginning a blackout and now occurs at the same time 216 hours, 28 minutes, 5 seconds. The end of blackout is 3 seconds earlier than the previous number, it's now 216 hours, 31 minutes, 20 seconds. Prior to the end of blackout, the spacecraft will enter the region of maximum G forces; this will be a maximum G of about 6.2. It will occur at about 216 hours, 29 minutes.
211:56:27 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
211:56:32 Roosa: Go ahead, Houston.
211:56:34 McCandless: After you have finished with this P23, Stu, we will uplink to you a new MSFN state vector for the CSM and load it into the IM state vector slot and leave it there until time to uplink you our final MSFN state vector, which will ccme about - come after your'last set of P23s. And for your information, in the event that we should have communications problems, the CSM state vector that we read up to you in the PAD yesterday would be acceptable for conducting an entry. Over.
211:57:20 Roosa: Okay.
Very long comm break.
Some of our additional times in the entry sequence continuing on for drogue deploy at 216 hours 35 minutes 54 seconds, and deployment of the main parachute at 216 hours 34 - 36 minutes, 216 hours, 36 minutes 41 seconds, and flight change also on the splash down time. We're now showing 216 hours 41 minutes 39 seconds. And that splashdown time is showing a change of only about 4 seconds. We've now got splashdown occurring about 4 seconds later than on the previous set of numbers passed up to the crew. And we expect that these numbers will continue to change by small amounts in the information passed up to the crew one hour prior to entry which will be more than likely be the last update, we'll probably see some few seconds of change in these numbers. The angular entry interface is also showing a small change with added tracking, and it seems to be shifting more toward the center of the entry corridor. Since our last reading, that angle has changed by only one, one hundredth of a degree, by now reading negative six point three nine degrees of entry interface. The exact sum of the entry corridor would be 6.5 and the return-to-Earth officer feels that the 6.39 is more than adequate. At 212 hours the Apollo 14 is traveling at a speed now of 10,454 feet per second. Nearly two miles per second. And the spacecraft altitude 34 323 nautical miles from Earth. And at this time our large ten by twenty display board in the front of the control center is beginning to show the effects of the everincreasing gravity on the spacecraft trajectory ground track. Beginning to curve southward now, it will eventually loop back on itself, sweeping up beneath Australia to the mid Pacific landing point south of Samoa. The recovery people report that the prime recovery ship, New Orleans is on station steaming around the recovery area, and then in a little more than one hour the first of two ARIA, Apollo Range Instrumented Aircraft, will leave from Samoa to be on station in the recovery area about one hundred miles north of the ground track. The weather in the recovery area is good, we have a wind of about 18 knots, out of the southeast, and wave heights of about five feet.
212:10:49 McCandless: ...
212:11:48 McCandless: 14, this is Houston.
212:11:51 Mitchell: Go ahead.
212:11:53 McCandless: After Stu finishes his marks on this last star, we'd like him to stand by for a possible rerun of star 22, in the present attitude and configuration; we also have to do a ground tracking station handover here, and we'll do that after he finishes marking on this star and advise you. Over.
212:12:18 Mitchell: Understand.
212:19:16 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. If you'll give us P00 and Accept, we'd like to uplink to you a new CSM state vector for the LM slot. The - the desired orientation and entry Lat and Long. Over.
212:19:31 Mitchell: You've got it.
212:19:32 McCandless: Okay.
Long comm break.
212:26:56 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. We have finished with the uplink. The computer's yours. Our recommendation on the P23 sightings is that you return to star 22 and take additional marks until you are satisfied with the magnitude of the Delta-R, Delta-V updates, or until we start running shy on time. It looks now like we can slip the initial P52 you have scheduled at 212 hours down to about 213 hours, since we have canceled midcourse 7. Over.
212:27:32 Roosa: Okay, Bruce. Just keep shooting star 22, only.
212:27:36 McCandless: That's affirmative. The marks that you took that drove the state vector out were those derived frcm star 22, and I'm informed that the fastest way to bring your state vector back in would be to put in compensatory marks from the same general direction. Over.
212:27:55 Roosa: Okay. We'll give it a go.
212:38:33 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. We show your computed value of vacuum perigee coming down into agreement with the MSFN value at the rate of about 2 miles or so per mark on star 22. Over.
212:38:52 Roosa: Yes, Bruce. The way I figure it, I've got about 16 marks to go.
212:38:56 McCandless: Well, we were going to say 10 marks to go, but we thought you'd figure we were being sarcastic.
212:39:04 Roosa: No, I'm looking at Verb 83, and she's coming down about - well, it was 30 miles - down about 25 miles a mark.
212:39:20 Roosa: You know, I could have already been through if I had a recycle on this program.
212:39:26 McCandless: Okay, I'll tell the Min Key boys about that.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 212 hours, 48 minutes and we're now about 3 hours, 53 minutes from splashdown, Apollo 14 traveling at a velocity now of 11,298 feet per second, 29,422 nautical miles from Earth. Stu Roosa, aboard Apollo 14, is still involved in midcourse navigation using the onboard sextant and computer. At one point you heard a conversation between Roosa and Spacecraft Communicator Bruce McCandless referring to the fact that Roosa's marks taken at the time of the sighting appeared to be bringing the onboard readings into closer agreement with those we' have here on the ground. At one point the difference between the onboard and the ground readings was extremely close. In taking the last set of marks, using, in this particular set of readings, a series of stars and the lunar far horizon, Roosa reported that he apparently on one star sighted along the near horizon of the Moon rather than the far horizon, giving him an unusually large difference on that particular star. In his update the process now is to go back and remark on the same star a number of times to get the readings in agreement. The onboard navigation is used as a backup and would be available to the crew in the event we lost communications at some point in the return leg of the journey from the Moon and were unable to pass to them the ground computed values which will be used as the prime source for entry. And among the readings that we're watching, as Roosa continues to take marks and bring his onboard state vector in closer agreement with the ground computed one, is the onboard measurement of the height of vacuum perigee. This is the computed altitude at which the spacecraft would pass Earth if Earth had no atmosphere, and of course what actually happens is that the Earth's atmosphere captures the vehicle and slows it down for entry and parachute deployment. Without an atmosphere the computed value would show that the spacecraft would pass about 20 nautical miles from the surface of the Earth and this is one of the figures that when the wrong lunar horizon was used onboard that we saw a change. It jumped up to about 80 nautical miles and it's coming down now with additional marks on the proper horizon to about 35 and we presume eventually will drop back down to a very close agreement with the 20 that we are computing here on the ground. Again repeating, this procedure is used as a backup in the event that communications did not permit us to give the ground computed numbers to the crew, and of course we've already gotten a preliminary set of numbers in for the entry and these would be adequate in the event that we were not able to give them the final PAD, which will come probably about one hour prior to entry. At 212 hours 52 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston standing by.
212:54:00 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
212:54:04 Roosa: Go ahead, Houston.
212:54:05 McCandless: Stu, we're showing your calculation of vacuum perigee coming down only about 1 mile per mark at the present time. We've got about 21 miles for the MSFN solutions and about 53 for yours. We suggest that you terminate the P23 marking routines at this time and press on for the Flight Plan. Over.
212:54:31 Roosa: Okay. Sounds like a good winner.
Long comm break.
212:58:45 McCandless: 14, Houston. We copy your torquing angles.
212:58:57 Roosa: Okay, and torquing is 212:58:50.
This is Stu's 28th P52 realignment of the guidance platform during the flight. As a reference, he sighted on star 16 (Procyon) and star 23 (Denebola). As a check of his sighting accuracy, the computer compared the measured angle between these stars and the actual angle. The difference between them was 000.01 degrees, a very good result. Finally, the computer displayed Noun 93, the angles by which the gimbals would be rotated or 'torqued' to restore perfect alignment. These were -0.049° in X, -0.010° in Y and +0.014° in Z axis. According to the post-flight Mission Report, the platform was torqued at 212:59:00 GET.
212:59:17 McCandless: I'd suggest you give them a call on it so you could [aside] - -
212:59:20 Roosa: * * ?
212:59:42 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. Before torquing to the entry REFSMMAT, we recommend SCS - and check your Limit Cycle switch, On, please. Over.
212:59:53 Roosa: Okay.
Long comm break.
213:08:21 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston.
213:08:53 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
213:08:55 Roosa: Go ahead.
213:08:58 McCandless: Okay, 14. We hadn't planned on any sort of a complete or comprehensive newscast this morning - on your way in to entry, as we figured you'd probably get a pretty good briefing after splashdown. There is one item I'd like to read up to you, however, if you have a minute.
213:09:20 Shepard: Okay, go ahead with that - and we'd also be interested in what the weather is in the recovery area when you finish.
213:09:26 McCandless: Okay, recovery area weather is about 1,500 - or 2,000 scattered, higher broken, winds from 100 degrees at 15 knots - the waves are - are two sets. You've got a batch of 2-foot waves with a 2-second period, and superimposed on them, you have some 4-foot waves with a 3-second period - and, in general, it looks pretty good. I can get some more details for you, if you're interested. Over.
213:09:56 Shepard: Well, that's pretty good - unless it changes from that measurably, that sounds like it's not bad at all.
213:10:03 McCandless: Right. And we'll have an update for you on the weather as you get closer to interface. This one is dateline Los Angeles. "A powerful Earthquake hit southern California at 8:01 central standard time today, causing two reported deaths, numerous injuries, and cracked buildings and highways. The jolting trembler was felt over at least 350 miles from Fresno to below the Mexican border. But damage was worse in Los Angeles and its heavily populated San Fernando Valley. The center of the shock was reported at 17 miles north of the valley in the rugged San Gabriel Mountains. Major damage is reported in the two closest towns of Newhall and Saugus, 35 miles northwest of downtown L.A. The magnitude of the shock was rated at between 6 and 6.5 on the Richter scale, which rates major quakes at 7 or more. It was the strongest quake in the Los Angeles area since the 1952 trembler at Tehachapi to the north, which had the magnitude of 7.2 and was strongly felt in L.A. It killed 13 persons. The San Francisco Earthquake was 8.25." Over.
213:11:14 Mitchell: Well, looks like San Andreas is kicking up again.
While Bruce continues with the news update, Stu performs an important preparation for their reentry procedure and realigns the IMU platform according to the entry REFSMMAT. Their long-serving PTC REFSMMAT is replaced by one that will provide a more useful attitude reference for their reentry. While the PTC REFSMMAT has the spacecraft X axis aligned to the plane of the ecliptic, in the entry REFSMMAT it is aligned to their direction of travel.
This is Stu's 29th P52 realignment of the guidance platform during the flight. As a reference, he sighted on star 23 (Denebola) and star 16 (Procyon). As a check of his sighting accuracy, the computer compared the measured angle between these stars and the actual angle. The difference between them was 000.01 degrees, a near perfect result. Finally, the computer displayed Noun 93, the angles by which the gimbals would be rotated or 'torqued' to restore perfect alignment. These were +0.021° in X, +0.002° in Y and -0.036° in Z axis. According to the post-flight Mission Report, the platform was torqued at 213:11 GET.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 213 hours 42 minutes. It's been relatively quiet here in mission control with everything progressing smoothly towards splashdown in about 3 hours. At the present time Apollo 14 is up to a velocity of 12 587 feet per second. And Apollo 14 now has 23 530 nautical miles to go. During the last hour before entry, we'll see a dramatic increase in the spacecraft velocity as the number Jumps from about 18,000 feet per second to about 36,000 feet per second and at entry interface, we will expect the velocity to be reading about 36,170 feet per second. The guidance officer reported a short while ago that the crew now has the spacecraft in the proper attitude for the final set of star sightings, midcourse navigation, and we expect they'll probably be doing this a little bit ahead of the Flight Plan due to the fact that the final midcourse correction, midcourse correction 7 has been deleted. Apollo 15 crewmen, Commander Dave Scott, Command Module Pilot Al Worden, and Lunar Module Pilot Jim Irwin, in pressure suit assemblies will show news men and photographers equipment and experiments that will be flown on their flight later this year. The showing is scheduled to be held tomorrow, February 10, from 10 to 11 am in the Manned Spacecraft Center building number 5. Equipment on display will include a full size Apollo 15 Lunar Module mock-up, the 1 G lunar roving vehicle, and all the equipment associated with it. Also all the lunar surface gear, including the Apollo lunar surface experiment package, or ALSEP, the sample return containers, crew tools and associated equipment. They will also have the Apollo Service Module SIM bay mock-up, along with the experiments which are in that bay. The gamma ray spectrometer, mass spectrometer, Alpha X-ray spectrometer, the sub satellite, the pan-camera, and the maping camera. During the deminstration the crew will be wearing their space suits minus the portable life support system, or backpacks, and minus the helmets, but these items will be displayed in the area. That's the Apollo 15 crew, and again the showing will be tomorrow, February 10, at 10 to 10 to 11 am in building number 5 at the Manned Spacecraft Center.
213:47:13 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. Whenever it is convenient with you, we would like to press on with the logic sequence check and get that out of the way. And I understand that this 212 alarm is expected - as a consequence of the CMC self-check.
213:47:31 Mitchell: Roger. We'll give you a buzz when we're ready to move out.
213:47:36 McCandless: Roger.
213:49:50 Mitchell: Houston, on the logic sequences check, we're standing by for SECS Logic, on.
213:50:04 McCandless: Stand by, please, 14.
213:50:16 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. We show that the Logic power is on at the present time. Over.
213:50:27 Shepard: That's affirmative - -
213:50:29 Mitchell: We're standing by - -
213:50:30 Shepard: We're standing by at the present time.
213:50:31 Mitchell: Yes. We're standing by on the step SECS Logic, two on, up.
213:50:39 McCandless: Okay. That's what we show as already having been accomplished. What is the position of your SECS Logic switches? Over.
213:50:48 Mitchell: Okay. They are on, up. That was a cockpit error here. Okay, we're standing by for Go.
213:50:56 McCandless: Roger, Ed. Your system is in a good configuration. Do not arm the pyros at this time; however, you would be Go, if you had desired to. Over.
213:51:07 Mitchell: Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 214 hours 11 minutes. We're now 2 hours 31 minutes away from splashdown. Everything is progressing smoothly at this time. Apollo 14 traveling at a velocity of 13,529 feet per second, and the spacecraft now 20,127 nautical miles from Earth. Again, to go over the events during and Just before the entry sequence, entry interface occurs at 216 hours 27 minutes 47 seconds. We expect that number could possibly change by a matter of a few seconds. The Flight Dynamics and return-to-Earth officers have completed their final computations on entry, however, we would expect the change would be quite small. Again, the entry time 216 hours 27 minutes 47 seconds. Fifteen minutes prior to ghat the crew will Jettison the Service Module, and they will do this by yawing the spacecraft 45 degrees and then Jettisoning. This is to minimize any change of recontact of the two modules of the spacecraft during entry, we'll then return to the entry attitude and at 216 hours 28 minutes 05 seconds, or about 18 seconds after entry, they'll enter blackout. Blackout will last until 3 minutes 33 seconds after entry, and in the period of blackout at about 1 minute 25 seconds following entry, they'll experience maximum g forces, the max g load about 6.2. The drogue parachutes are scheduled to deploy at 216 hours 35 minutes 54 seconds, and about 47 seconds later, the three main chutes will come out. That will be at 216 hours 36 minutes 41 seconds, with splashdown scheduled to occur at 216 hours 41 minutes 39 seconds. And the latest splash coordinants. And again, no change in these since yesterday, _ill be 27 degrees 2 minutes south 172 degrees 40 minutes west, which will put the splashdown point some 10 miles west of the international date line. The recovery ship New Orleans is on station at this time and will be supplemented by five recovery helicopters, two rescue aircraftC-130's, and also two Apollo range instrumented aircraft standing by about 100 nautical miles north of the ground track. Again, repeating an earlier announcement, Apollo 15 crewmen, Commander Dave Scott, Command Module Pilot Al Worden, and Lunar Module Pilot Jim Irwin, and pressure garment assemblies will show newsmen and photographers equipment and experiments that will flown on their flight later this year. The showing will be held tomorrow, February 10, from 10 to 11 am at building 5 at the Manned Spacecraft Center. Equipment on display will include a fullsize Apollo 15 Lunar Module mockup, the 1-g lunar loading vehicle, and all the equipment associated with it, and also will be all of the lunar service gear, including the Apollo lunar surface experiment package, the sample return containers, crew tools and associated equipment, and the equipment in the Apollo Service Module send bay mockup which includes the gamma ray spectrometer, mass spectrometer, alpha ray spectrometer, a subsattelite, the pan camera, and the mapping camera. The crew will be suited, they will be minus the portable life support systems for backpacks and helmets. These items will be displayed in the area. Again that is at 10 am in building 5 at the Manned Spacecraft Center tomorrow, February 10. At 214 hours 15 minutes, Apollo 14 is 19,608 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 13,698 feet per second.
214:23:37 Mitchell: Eight ..,
214:23:42 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
214:23:45 Mitchell: Loud and clear, Houston.
214:23:47 McCandless: Roger; reading you the same.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 214 hours 37 minutes. At the present time the crew on Apollo 14 is making the final alignment of their guidance platform. The stable number of the platform that will be used to attitude references on board the spacecraft during entry, and in the next hour and 50 minutes before they begin entry, the crew will be running an entry check, configuring their Reaction Control System, and running some checks on that system. They'll also be checking the entry monitoring system, and will then maneuver to a horizon check attitude prior to Jettisoning the Service Module. The Service Module Jettison will come about 15 minutes prior to entry. They will then maneuver back to entry attitude and a final position for Earth entry. Entry to occur at Ground Elapsed Time of 216 hours 27 minutes 47 seconds splashdown at 216 hours 41 minutes 39 seconds. At this time Apollo 14 is 16,671 nautical miles from Earth. The velocity increasing evermore rapidly up now to 14,731 feet per second.
214:38:27 McCandless: Torquing angles look good there, Stu.
Mission Control has been monitoring their entry preparations, which includes Stu performing yet another P52 IMU realignment. Bruce has chimed in to note that they agree with the displayed Noun 93 values even before Roosa had the time to comment on them himself.
214:38:31 Roosa: Okay.
214:38:37 Shepard: Okay, Houston. We'll be torquing at 214:38:45.
This is Stu's 30th and final P52 realignment of the guidance platform during the flight. As a reference, he sighted on star 30 (Menkent, Theta Centauri) and star 37 (Nunki, Sigma Sagittarii). As a check of his sighting accuracy, the computer compared the measured angle between these stars and the actual angle. The difference between them was 000.00, or 'all balls', meaning that Stu's sighting accuracy was perfect. Finally, the computer displayed Noun 93, the angles by which the gimbals would be rotated or 'torqued' to restore perfect alignment. These were +0.039° in X, -0.040° in Y and -0.069° in Z axis. According to the postflight Mission Report, the platform was torqued at GET 214:39:00.
214:38:44 McCandless: Roger, Al.
Long comm break.
214:43:15 McCandless: Apollo 4 - Apollo 4 - Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over. Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
214:43:34 Shepard: Go ahead, Houston.
214:43:36 McCandless: Roger, 14.' We'd like to conduct the VHF SIMPLEX Alpha check at this time, if one of you can support it. Over.
214:43:55 Mitchell: This is Apollo 14, on VHF Alpha. How do you read?
214:43:59 McCandless: Okay, Ed. We're reading you loud with a - a little bit of garble. I understand you've turned off your S-BAND T/R, and you're coming at us VHF Alpha. Is that correct? Over,
214:44:09 Mitchell: ... I was coming at you simo that time. And I'm coming out VHF Alpha.
214:44:15 McCandless: Roger. Standing by.
214:44:17 Mitchell: Houston, Apollo 14. How do you read VHF Alpha?
214:44:21 McCandless: Oh, loud and clear, VHF Alpha, Ed. How me?
214:44:25 Mitchell: You can cut it down a little bit, Bruce; it's readable.
214:44:43 McCandless: Okay. We're still over an hour - more likely, about an hour and 10 minutes out from the point we normally conduct the check, and chart is showing you about 17,000 miles out; so, I think it's a pretty good check. Over.
214:44:45 Mitchell: Very good.
Long comm break.
214:51:31 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
214:51:34 Mitchell: Go ahead, Houston.
214:51:36 McCandless: If you're interested, I have an update on the weather for you. Over.
214:51:42 Mitchell: All right. Stand by. Okay, go ahead with your weather update.
214:51:47 McCandless: Roger. At your planned landing area, the general condition is good. You've got 2,000 feet scattered, high broken, and 10-mile visibility. The wind is 120 degrees at 15- Wave height is 4 feet, with a southerly swell of 4 feet. The altimeter is 3006 or minus 128-foot pressure altitude. GMT computed for your landing is 21:05 on the ninth. Sunrise was at 17:15 in the night; sunset at 06:20:00 on the tenth. That's for your G&N target point; and over at the constant-g target point, there's really no significant change between the order at the two places. Your recovery forces standing by are the landing platform helicopter, New Orleans, which is 5 miles from the target point. Swim 1 and 2, SH-3 helicopters in the vicinity of the target point, and the ship Ponchatoula at the backup target point; It's an A0, oiler. Other support, you've got Photo 1 and Relay 1, and SH-3 helicopters in the vicinity of the target point that are providing photo and voice coverage, and Samoa Rescue 1 and 2, HC-130s that are about 45 minutes away. Over.
Bruce mentions two potential landing targets for the Command Module splashdown. Their primary target, and also the location of the best part of the recovery forces is the 'G&N target point' which is the location the onboard computer will attempt to fly to during reentry. The 'constant g target point' is the backup landing target. Should the guidance computer fail and the SCS-based Entry Monitoring System become unusable as well, the crew can perform an emergency landing by rotating the spacecraft using the hand controller, and using the readout from the accelerometer to maintain a constant deceleration of 4 g's. By holding 4 g's, they will reduce their velocity enough that they will splash down, not with great accuracy, but safe enough.
214:53:38 Mitchell: Okay, Houston. I believe I got all of that, and I hope to be in contact with the New Orleans then very soon.
214:53:47 McCandless: Roger.
Comm break.
214:57:29 Roosa: And, Houston; 14. The EMS checks out real fine.
214:57:35 McCandless: Roger, Stu. Copy EMS entry check complete.
215:04:02 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. If you could give us P00 and Accept, we have your final state vector uplink for you. Over.
215:04:14 Roosa: Okay, Bruce. You've got it.
215:04:17 McCandless: Roger.

215:06:19 McCandless: 14, Houston. We're through with the computer; the uplink's in, and you've got a MSFN state vector in both slots. Over.
215:06:35 Roosa: Roger. Thank you, Bruce.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 215 hours, 11 minutes. A Flight Dynamics Officer reported a short while ago that he had completed his final computations on spacecraft position and velocity. These are the numbers used by the return to Earth officer and his final computations of the entry and post entry event and we'll be passing those numbers up to the crew here in a matter of minutes. At the present Apollo 14 is 16,924 - rather traveling at a velocity of 16,924 feet per second and now 11,985 nautical miles from Earth. Weather in the recovery area remains good and we're moving steadily and smoothly towards entry in 1 hour, 15 minutes, 40 seconds with splashdown in approximately 1 hour, 30 minutes.
215:19:38 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
215:19:42 Mitchell: Go ahead, Houston.
215:19:44 McCandless: Okay, 14. I've got some changes to your entry PAD. Over.
215:19:51 Mitchell: Okay. Go ahead, Houston.
215:19:55 McCandless: Okay. Under Noun 60, gamma at 400,000 feet should be minus - should be 6.37 vice 6.39 - I say again, 6.37. Over.
215:20:10 Mitchell: Understand; 6.37.
215:20:12 McCandless: EMS range-to-go should be 1138.1. Over.

The data passed up for a corrected and final Entry PAD is interpreted as follows:
Purpose: Entry.
Landing target: The landing target is the Mid-Pacific Recovery Area.
IMU gimbal angles required for trim at 0.05g: Roll, 000°; pitch, 154°; yaw, 000°.
Time of the horizon check: 216 hours, 10 minutes, 47 seconds GET.
Spacecraft pitch at horizon check: 267°. This check is carried out 17 minutes prior to Entry Interface.
Splashdown point: 27.02° south latitude, 172.65° west longitude.
Maximum number of g's during entry: 6.2.
Velocity at Entry Interface (400,000 feet altitude): 36,170 feet/second (11,025 meters/second).
Entry flight path angle at Entry Interface: 6.37°.
Range to go to splashdown point from 0.05g event: 1,138.1 nautical miles. To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance the CM would travel from the 0.05 g event to landing. This figure will be decremented by the EMS based on signals from its own accelerometer.
Predicted inertial velocity at 0.05g event: 36,251 feet/second. This is another entry for the EMS. It is entered into the unit's Delta-V counter and will be decremented based on signals from its own accelerometer.
Time of Entry Interface: 216 hours, 27 minutes, 47 seconds GET.
Time from Entry Interface to 0.05g event: 00:29 (seconds).
Planned drag level (deceleration) during the constant g phase (D0): 4.00 g.
Time from Entry Interface until their velocity slows sufficiently to allow a circular orbit around the Earth: 02:10. The practical implication of this is that this is the "capture point" where the CM will no longer be able to skip off the atmosphere. Since the spacecraft will already be within the Earth's sensible atmosphere at this point, drag will continue to slow the spacecraft and the return to Earth is assured.
Time from Entry Interface that the communications blackout begins: 00:18 (seconds).
Time from Entry Interface that the communications blackout ends: 03:35 (minutes and seconds).
Time from Entry Interface that the drogue parachutes will deploy: 08:05 (minutes and seconds)
Sextant star: 30 (Menkent, Theta Centauri)
Sextant shaft angle at Entry Interface minus 2 minutes: 354.3°.
Sextant trunnion angle at Entry Interface minus 2 minutes: 30.7°.
The next three items refer to an attitude check made using the COAS sighted on a star two minutes before Entry Interface.
Boresight star: Nu Hydra
Boresight Star pitch angle on COAS: Up 21.1°.
Boresight Star X position on COAS: Left 2.8°.
Lift vector at Entry Interface: Up. Since the direction of the lift vector is towards the crew's feet, they will re-enter in a heads-down attitude.
Further information pertaining to the reentry is given in the following notes:
They should use the scroll pattern in the EMS that relates to an entry that is not designed to exit the atmosphere for a period.
Mooncheck: Moon visible at the left of window. Moon viewing attitude roll, 0°; pitch, 182°; yaw, 0°
Moonset: 216:25:15 GET
Elapsed time at 90,000-ft altitude: 06:28 (mins/seconds)
Main parachute deployment time: 08:53 (mins/seconds)
Landing: 13:51 (mins/seconds)
Constant g reentry roll: Right.
GDC Align stars: The stars to be used for GDC Align purposes are Sirius and Rigel.
GDC Align angles: Roll, 322°; pitch, 325°; yaw, 018°.
Less than an hour remains until reentry
215:23:16 Mitchell: Houston, 14. We are planning on activating the RCS about minus 1 hour.
215:23:24 McCandless: Say again, 14.
215:23:28 Mitchell: We're planning on activating the Command Module RCS at about minus 1 hour.
215:23:33 McCandless: Roger. We copy.
215:26:29 Roosa: Okay, Houston. The Logic is on, and we're standing by for a Go for Pyro Arm.
215:26:34 McCandless: Roger. We see the Logic on and stand by, please. Apollo 14, this is Houston. You are Go for Pyro Arm.
215:26:44 Roosa: Roger, 14.
215:27:13 Roosa: And we got both rings pressurized here.
215:27:17 McCandless: Roger, 14. Okay. Both rings look good from down here, 14.
215:27:30 Roosa: Jolly good.
