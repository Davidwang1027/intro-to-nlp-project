032:02:36 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. Stand by for an important announcement. [Pause.]
032:02:45 Roosa: Rog. Standing by.
032:02:47 McCandless: Roger. You're Go for PTC spinup now. [Pause.]
032:02:58 Roosa: What would we do without you, Bruce? [Long pause.]
032:03:17 Roosa: Hey, Bruce. How come we haven't heard any news, like who won at Daytona and things like that?
032:03:25 McCandless: Well, we tried for one news summary and most of the news came out to be on the subject of Apollo 14. We figured you guys were probably the ones that had the inside scoop on that, so we'll give a stab at another one.
032:03:38 Roosa: Yeah. Tell us what's going on at the races at Daytona.
032:03:42 McCandless: Okay. Give us a couple of minutes and we'll have some word for you.
032:03:48 Roosa: Oh, no sweat. Just at your convenience.

032:29:10 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston.
032:29:13 Shepard: Go ahead, Houston. [Pause.]
032:29:21 McCandless: If the workload isn't too heavy up there for you, we've got another set of Noun 88 values for sighting on the S-IVB, if you're interested.
032:29:34 Shepard: Okay, stand by and I'll copy them down. [Long pause.]
032:30:20 Shepard: Okay, Houston. Go ahead.
032:30:23 McCandless: Roger, 14. Noun 88: minus 34293, minus 85901, minus 38013. Over. [Pause.]
032:30:48 Roosa: Okay, Bruce, you back with us?
032:30:49 McCandless: Yeah, I'm still with you. [Pause.]
032:31:00 McCandless: 14, Houston. How do you read?
032:31:05 Roosa: Hello, Houston. How do you read? 14.
032:31:08 McCandless: 14, we're approaching an antenna switchover period here. Let me give you a call again in a minute. [Long pause.]
032:31:45 Roosa: Hello, Houston. How do you read 14?
032:31:48 McCandless: 14, Houston. Loud and clear. How me? Over.
032:31:52 Roosa: We're back with you. How about giving me R3 again, please?
032:31:56 McCandless: Okay, R3 is minus 38013. Read back. Over.
032:32:04 Roosa: Okay; reading you back from Noun 88: minus 34293, minus 85901, minus 38013.
032:32:16 McCandless: Roger; readback correct. These are calculated for a GET of 32 hours, 45 minutes; but should be valid from the present up through about 33:45. You will be able to see the S-IVB when your spacecraft roll angle is between 85 degrees, that's 085 degrees and 020 degrees. If you do see it through the sextant, we'd like you to try to take some pictures, using the same techniques as on the dim-light photography per camera advance, same film magazine, the same exposure times, if you concur. Over. [Long pause.]
032:33:01 Roosa: Okay, sounds great. I understand this is set up for a time of 32 plus 45:00, however, it ought to be good now and we ought to be able to hack it when our roll is between 085 to 020. And if we lap the big moose, we'll take some pictures of it using the same magazine and the same procedures as the Earth dim light that we just finished. [Long pause.]
032:33:31 McCandless: Roger; Roger.
Long comm break.

032:39:17 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. Be advised that the S-IVB is tumbling at a rate of one tumble - that is, one 360-degree tumble - about every 4 and a half minutes, so that the intensity of the object may vary if you see it out there. And even if you don't, we've been considering the speed of the film. We'd like to take same pictures. Perhaps it would show up on photography if you can't see it with the naked eye. And another item, your phase plane plot for PTC - It looks like you've established a very good PTC here. It's curving back around toward the center. We think it's going to hold for quite some time. And we'd like to get battery Alpha on charge at your convenience. Over. [Pause.]
032:40:13 Roosa: Okay, Bruce; copy that. When we get around to the right roll angle, we'll give a Go on the S-IVB. Copy about the PTC, and we'll start a charge.
032:40:23 McCandless: Roger.

032:54:51 McCandless: Do you see anything out there, Stu?
032:54:57 Roosa: Well, we're just now coming out from behind the LM. Looks like I've got something here in the sextant. Let me pull her in the center and see what it looks like. [Long pause.]
032:55:48 Roosa: Well, Bruce, I've got two things in the sextant and - You know, it could either be a faint - faint star - I don't see any - any tumbling on them yet, but 4 and a half minutes isn't that fast either.
032:56:13 McCandless: Roger. We copy. [Long pause.]
032:56:27 Roosa: Okay, I've lost one of them due to the light coming into the sextant. And I'm about to lose - lose the other object, whatever it was.
Comm break.
032:58:18 McCandless: And 14, Houston. We got a little sports news for you.
032:58:26 Roosa: Okay, go ahead. You're just in time for dinner.
032:58:31 McCandless: Would you rather I croon something soothing to you, like background music, or Ravel's Bolero or something?
032:58:39 Roosa: Negative on the music. We got all that we need here. You can just croon some good sport news.
032:58:47 Shepard: Why don't you hold on a minute and let Ed get his headset on?
032:58:51 McCandless: (Laughter) It's not that detailed.
Comm break.
Flight Plan page 3-036
033:00:36 Shepard: Okay, Houston. Everybody's on the line.
033:00:39 McCandless: Okay, I don't know if it was really all that Earthshaking. I've got the results of the Daytona races. It was won by Pedro Rodriguez from Mexico with his partner Jackie Oliver in a Porsche, and they completed 688 laps of the 3.81-mile course there at Daytona in 24 hours. Ronnie Bucknum and Tony Adamowicz were second in a Ferrari, and Lamak Donohue-David Hobbs team was third. In winning the event, Rodriguez and Oliver averaged over 109 miles per hour for the 24-hour period. And Sunday's Andy Williams, San Diego Open Golf Tournament, Californian George Archer took the honors with a 7-under-par score against his closest competitors, Dave Eichelberger and Jack Nicklaus. Archer ended up with a 65 and $30,000 in prize money. Over. [Pause.]
033:01:47 Shepard: Okay, very good. Thank you. Keep up the good news.
033:01:50 McCandless: Roger. You can tell Ed to take his headset back off now.

This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 10 minutes. We're at a relatively quiet period in the Flight Plan. The crew is scheduled to begin a rest at about 41 hours Ground Elapsed Time. At the present time we show Apollo 14 124,800 nautical miles [231,130 km] from Earth, traveling at a velocity of 4,149 feet per second [1,265 m/s]. The Flight Dynamics Officer reported to the Flight Director a short while ago that tracking seems to be confirming that the midcourse correction maneuver is bringing the spacecraft in a little bit higher above the Moon than had been planned. This would indicate a slight underburn. The predicted point of closest approach at this time is still holding quite close to 37 - rather 67 nautical miles [124 km]. The burn had been targeted to bring the spacecraft to within 60 nautical miles [111 km] at its closest approach. This particular burn seems to be - seems to have been quite sensitive to very small velocity errors. On the order of about 2/10 of a foot per second would, the FIDO says, account for the difference in the planned altitude and the actual, that 7 nautical miles [13 km]. Additional tracking, of course, will probably show some change in that number, but it seems to be holding in quite steadily at about 67 nautical miles [124 km]. The people in the spacecraft engineering support room report that all systems appear to be functioning well at this time aboard the spacecraft. Virtually no problems of any significance, and, as we mentioned earlier, the crew was advised this evening that with the probe at - with what we know about the probe at this time, it appears that the mission will be Go for a lunar landing. At 33 hours, 12 minutes; this is Apollo Control, standing by.

This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 31 minutes. We've had no conversations with the crew since our last report about 30 minutes ago. At the present time Apollo 14 is 125,649 nautical miles [232,702 km] from Earth, and the spacecraft velocity is 4,121 feet per second [1,256 m/s]. We're preparing for a shift handover in Mission Control at the present time. And, we do anticipate having a change of shift briefing in the MSC News Center, Probably in about 45 minutes to an hour. Flight Director Gerry Griffin is coming on to relieve Flight Director Milton Windler, and the Capsule Communicator on the upcoming shift will be Astronaut Fred Haise. At 33 hours, 32 minutes; this is Apollo Control, Houston."
033:32:36 McCandless: 14, Houston.
033:32:40 Shepard: Go ahead, Houston.
033:32:42 McCandless: Roger. We took up a collection here in the Control Room and bought a newspaper, and we got a couple more items, if you're interested.
033:32:51 Shepard: Great. Take up another collection and you might buy two.
033:32:56 McCandless: Oh, we'll buy you a morning paper, too, a little later. On the Daytona race, a few more details. Reading into the article, Rodriguez and Oliver divided the driving chores up about equally ...
033:33:13 Shepard: Bruce, hold up just a second.
033:33:19 Shepard: Hold it a second.
033:33:20 McCandless: Roger. [Long pause.]
033:33:54 Mitchell: Okay, Bruce. Everyone's on the net now. Proceed.
033:33:57 McCandless: Okay. Stand by. [Long pause.]
033:34:45 McCandless: Apollo 14, Houston.
033:34:48 Roosa: Go ahead.
033:34:50 McCandless: Roger. Back in the Daytona, it says that Rodriguez and Oliver divided...
Comm break.
033:36:20 McCandless: 14, Houston. How do you read now? [Long pause.]
033:36:43 McCandless: Apollo 14, Houston. How do you read now?
033:36:48 Mitchell: Loud and clear, Bruce. Go ahead.
033:36:50 McCandless: Okay. Let me try it once more with vigor. Back in the Daytona Race, Rodriguez and Oliver divided up the driving chores about equally, and had built up a lead of 213 miles at one point in the race. But trouble struck with about 3 hours left when the car's transmission failed as Oliver was motoring around with not a care in the world. Two Ferraris - the one driven alternately by Bucknum and Tony Adamowicz of Wilton, Connecticut, and another under command of two-time U.S. road racing champion Mark Donohue and David Gobbs of England had survived the long night but were out of it as long as the Porsche held together. Oliver brought the powder-blue car into the pit, and he and Rodriguez spent an agonizing 93 minutes watching their lead wiped out as crewmen feverishly made repairs. Bucknum gained the lead 70 minutes from the end and Donohue pulled into striking distance before crew chief John Wyer could get the Porsche rolling again. Rodriguez bolted back to the course a half mile behind Bucknum, whose Ferrari was spitting fire and having trouble getting through the turns. The Mexican hotshot needed less than two laps around the 3.81-mile layout to catch Bucknum and was never in serious trouble again. [Pause.]
033:38:19 Roosa: Damn. That's a - That's a good summary, Bruce.
033:38:22 McCandless: Yeah. I ought to be a sportswriter. [Long pause.]
033:38:37 Haise: And that was very interesting, Bruce. And the next item here is a headline that says 'Apollo number 4900 to orbit the Earth. [Pause.]
033:38:54 Unknown crew member: (Laughter)
033:38:56 Haise: 'The Aerospace Defense Command has entered Apollo 14 as number 4900 in its records of Earth orbiting satellites. The ADC, housed inside Cheyenne Mountain, is providing NASA with information on satellites passing near Apollo 14 during its journey to the Moon.' Just thought you might be interested in that.
Aerospace Defense Command, also known by its more famous acronym NORAD, assigns an identification number to all artificial objects in Earth orbit that they are able to track. In 1971, NORAD was operated from an enormous nuclear bunker carved into the Cheynne Mountain in Colorado.
033:39:19 McCandless: Well, they say always better late than...
033:39:22 Mitchell: As I live and breathe, it's Fred-ly! (Laughter)
033:39:25 McCandless: It's better to be number 4900 than not to be at all (laughter). And, meanwhile, today at New York, "The doors of baseball's Hall of Fame swung open for seven old timers elected by a veterans' committee after the regular ballot of the Baseball Writers Association of America had failed to name any moderns to the shrine. Legendary pitcher Rube Marquard, who shares the record of 19 consecutive victories in a single season, and George M. Weiss, the executive genius who built the New York Yankees into an awesome powerhouse from the late 1940's, led the advance of the old timers. Also named were outfielders Harry Hooper, Joe Kelley, and Chick Hafey, first baseman Jake Beckley, and shortstop Dave Bancroft. Marquard, who won 201 games pitching mostly for the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers from 1908 to 1925; Hooper, who hit 281 in 16 American League seasons; and Kelley and Beckley, both pre-1900 stars, were named as 'real old timers' whose careers ended by 1925." [Pause.]
033:40:39 Haise: And here's another startling bit of news - from London. The headline says, "Subway riders arrive; can't get out of station." "More than a dozen passengers were trapped in a London subway station for more than an hour early today when the staff locked up and went home." That sound familiar? "When the passengers got off the last train on the Bakerloo line, at the Maida Vale station in Paddington, they found exits blocked by steel shutters and the station deserted. Police were called and they in turn contacted London subway officials. A spokesman for the London Transport said it would investigate the incident. London Subway Service shuts down from about midnight to 5 AM." [Long pause.]
033:41:36 Mitchell: Could happen to anyone, anyplace.
033:41:40 McCandless: Also in the news is this other item from London. That D-day is less than 2 weeks away. They're referring here to the day when England changes to decimalized currency. "A government agency coordinating the switch says everything is going smoothly. 'Our latest survey has shown that since November there has been an incredible improvement in the extent to which people are familiar with the decimal equivalents,' a Decimal Currency Board spokesman said Sunday. On February 15, the new pound, worth $2.40, officially will become worth 100 new pence." [Pause.]
McCandless makes the common error of confusing England with the United Kingdom, although it may be the fault of the source he is reading from. It was the whole of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland which made the change to decimal currency in 1971, as did the Irish state.
033:42:21 Haise: And the next on the agenda here. "Vehicles are called the top noisemaker." Dateline is from Paris. "Motor vehicles are the chief source of city noise, and only governments can do anything about it. This opinion is the result of a 2-year study by the consultive group on transportation research of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development." Incredible! (Laughter) "This problem is worldwide." [Pause.]
033:43:02 Mitchell: Seems like you two have a good handle on world events, important world events.
033:43:08 McCandless: From Lourenco Marques, Mozambique, this item. "Fresh floodwaters have poured into Portuguese East Africa's cyclone-stricken lowlands today, hampering rescue efforts for thousands of flood victims already marooned 4 days. The central government said 135,000 persons lived in the worst-affected area around Quelimane, administrative capital of the central Zambesia province. Only 24,000 people have been rescued, but Zambesia Governor Lieutenant Gen - Lieutenant Colonel David Ferreira declined to estimate the death toll." Good night, Fred.
033:43:45 Haise: Very good. Good night, Bruce.
033:43:50 Roosa: Tremendous! [Pause.]
033:43:57 Shepard: Very nicely done. Very nicely done.
033:44:01 Haise: We had to censor the best parts.
033:44:05 Mitchell: Say again.
033:44:07 Haise: We had to censor the best parts.
033:44:11 Mitchell: That's too bad.
033:44:18 Mitchell: There will be a daily showing, I assume.
033:44:23 McCandless: Oh, we'll see what we can do.
Long comm break.

033:50:00 Roosa: Houston, 14.
033:50:05 McCandless: Go ahead, 14.
033:50:08 Roosa: Hey, Bruce. I'm going to take some pictures of this S-IVB area this time around. Do you want me to have the two strips at 24 frames per second for 2 seconds and everything just like on the other sequence?
033:50:26 McCandless: That's affirmative, Stu.
033:50:30 Roosa: Okay. [Long pause.]
033:50:59 McCandless: 14, Houston. If you feel like doing a little paperwork here, I've got an update to the inflight erasable load procedure as a result of the new PIPA bias and gyro compensations uplinked to you just prior to midcourse 2. [Pause.]
The Apollo Guidance Computer stores its program in a rope core memory unit - a form of read-only memory that could not be altered after manufacture. On top of this, two kilobytes of erasable memory contain data that can be changed either by the crew or via a radio link from Mission Control. Bruce wants the crew to input new values for a subroutine in the computer that creates mathematical compensation for errors that have been detected in the Inertial Measurement Unit. The PIPA accelerometers and the IRIG gyroscopes in the IMU are extremely sensitive instruments and have the tendency to develop small discrepancies in their performance during flight. Careful measurement of these deviations from their expected performance will allow them to alter the computer code to compensate.
033:51:23 Roosa: Okay, stand by 1, Bruce. [Long pause.]
033:51:59 Roosa: Okay, Bruce, go ahead.
Page 9-4 from the Command Module Guidance Checklist.
033:52:03 McCandless: 14, Houston. Page 9-4 in the G&C checklist, load A for Albuquerque. Under identification number 03, the old value is 77143; new value, 76674. OID 05: old, 00110; new, 00320; OID 07: old value, 76745; new value, 77417; OID 11: old value, 00477; new value, 006 - make that 00063. Read back. Over. [Pause.]
To change the pre-loaded values in the CMC erasable memory, the crew utilizes a special table in their G&C Checklist. The table contains the index codes for the memory locations and their expected values in octal base.
033:53:18 Roosa: Okay, under column A, 03, 76674; 05, 00320; 07, 77417; and 11, 00063.
033:53:39 McCandless: Roger; readback correct. For cryogenic hydrogen management, we'd like to turn the heater in Hydrogen tank number 2, Off, and our calculations show that your pericynthion altitude is currently 67 miles. As the period of our tracking improves, we expect this to work down towards about 60 nautical miles. And we have a question for you. Have you noticed any cosmic ray flashes during your last sleep period or at other times when the Command Module was darkened? Over. [Pause.]
The term 'pericynthion' refers to the closest approach to the lunar surface during each elliptic orbit. Its opposite is apocynthion, or the furthest point from the surface in an orbit. This term 'cyntheon' is derived from the name of Cynthia, an ancient Greek personification of the Moon.
033:54:24 Mitchell: One at a time, Houston. You say Hydrogen 2 Heater, Off? Over.
033:54:30 McCandless: Roger; H2 tank number 2, Heater, Off. We'll call you when we want it back to Auto or On.
033:54:37 Mitchell: Okay, it's Off now. And yea, verily, saw a few flashes. I'm not quite sure what they're ascribed to; but, nevertheless, we saw flashes during the sleep period last night.
033:54:51 McCandless: Okay, was this...
033:54:55 Mitchell: Unfortunately, we were a little bit - we were a little bit too tired to conduct any sort of measured experimenter data with them, but maybe we'll get around to that in the next few days.
033:55:08 McCandless: Roger. One question, would you say that you were dark-adapted when you saw these, or did you see them before you were well dark-adapted?
033:55:21 Mitchell: I will speak for myself. I didn't start seeing them until after I woke up, 3 or 4 hours after going to sleep.
033:55:28 Roosa: Hey, Bruce, I had a comment I noticed on that last night. I'd wake up several times and I'd turn on the light to take a look around PTC and that O2 flow that's been troubling us; and then I'd close my eyes again, and I'd see some flashes real soon after I had been looking at these lights. Now they were rather subdued lights, but you know - I certainly wasn't totally dark-adapted.
033:56:05 McCandless: Okay, what sort of lights were you using, the floodlights or the integrals?
033:56:12 Roosa: Using the integrals mostly; on several occasions, I did have the floods up to check, and then I'd turn them back off again. And it didn't seem to matter much.
There are two parallel lighting systems
033:56:26 McCandless: Okay, thank you, 14.

This is Apollo Control at 34 hours, 23 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Gold team Flight Director Gerry Griffin is being briefed by each of the console positions here, each man runs down the items that he has upcoming for this shift. The off-going Flight Director Milton Windler accompanied by his Flight Dynamics Officer Bill Boone, are en route to the Houston News Center where they will have a change of shift briefing for newsmen in the small auditorium. Apollo 14, very little conversation from the crew in the last several hours. Is now showing distance from Earth of 127,737 nautical miles [236,569 km]; velocity, 4,051 feet per second [1,235 m/s]. At 34 hours, 24 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.

The first two utterances on this audio are mixed with the tail of a PAO announcement.
034:45:00 Roosa: Houston, 14.
034:45:04 Haise: Go ahead, 14.
034:45:08 Roosa: Okay, Fred. We just went through the Hycon and everything checked out real fine and we ended up with magazine W on it.
Magazine W contains Panatomic-X 3400 black and white film for use in the Hycon Lunar Topographic Camera.
034:45:20 Haise: Okay. Copied. And, you ended up with magazine W.
034:45:26 Roosa: Rog. That's per the plan. [Long pause.]
034:45:45 Mitchell: Freddo, do they want these times - of these - at this point?
034:45:51 Haise: That's affirm, Ed. I guess they'd like the times and they'd like how many frames you used off the other Mag that was on there.
034:46:02 Mitchell: Okay. Mag V as in Victor. We started with frame zero and ended with frame 9, before resetting the counter. The LTC clock is on day 764 and 07:30 corresponds to GET of 34:26:42.
034:46:34 Haise: Okay. Copied. [Long pause.]
034:47:34 Mitchell: Say, Houston. We could play a lot of tic-tac-toe in the next two or three pages of the Flight Plan. [Pause.]
034:47:48 Haise: Say again, Ed.
034:47:54 Mitchell: The next three pages of the Flight Plan are very bare. We can play tic-tac-toe all afternoon on those.
034:48:01 Haise: All afternoon, huh? [Pause.]
034:48:09 Haise: It's about 02:00 down here.
The crew wakeup time was at 26 hours GET, which was around 5 pm Houston time.
034:48:14 Mitchell: ...we just had lunch a few minutes ago; it's afternoon.
034:48:17 Haise: Okay. [Pause.]
034:48:24 Haise: Yes, I have to agree with you about the next few pages. They do look pretty slim.

034:52:59 Mitchell: Go ahead, Freddo.
034:53:00 Haise: Yes, the photo people would like to know if y'all got the S-IVB pictures using the dim-light Earth-side settings there, and about when you did that - if you remember.
034:53:16 Mitchell: Stand by. We took some pictures. Whether we got them or not remains to be seen.
034:53:26 Haise: Is that a pun?
034:53:27 Mitchell: Rog. Say again. [Pause.]
034:53:38 Mitchell: Those pictures were completed at 34:03:25, and they were on magazine J for Juliett.
Magazine J ought to be 16 mm DAC film. It is identified in the Flight Plan but not listed in the post-flight photography catalogue. According to the Apollo 14 Preliminary Science Report, the dim light photography failed to produce any good results due to sun glare in the sextant optics rendering the pictures overexposed. Hence magazine Juliet's contents were deemed unusuable.
034:53:50 Haise: Okay. You got them at 34:03:25 on Mag Juliet.

This is Apollo Control at 35 hours, 5 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. During the change of shift press conference some 3½ minutes of air-to-ground conversation was recorded on tape for playback at this time. Presently Apollo 14 is 129,338 nautical miles [239,534 km] out from Earth, traveling at a velocity of just about an even 4,000 feet per second [1,200 m/s]. Some of the major milestones, at least from statisticians point of view; halfway point in time between lift-off and Lunar Orbit Insertion will come at 40 hours, 56 minutes; at which time the spacecraft will be 142,119 [nautical] miles [263,204 km] from Earth, and 81,723 miles [151,351 km] from the Moon. The anticipated time for crossing the so called equal-gravisphere between Earth and Moon will be 66 hours and 3 minutes and 7 seconds. I believe that tape may be ready now for playback. Let's roll that 3½ minutes and resume live (garble) air-to-ground.

This PAD is a contingency in case the crew need to fly past the Moon around its far side and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit. A full interpretation of the PAD follows:
Purpose: This PAD will be used for a lunar flyby should the spacecraft not enter orbit.
Systems: The burn would be made using the SPS (Service Propulsion System) engine under the control of the Guidance and Navigation system.
CSM Weight (Noun 47): 63526 pounds (28,815 kg).
Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48): +0.90° and -0.33°.
Time of ignition, TIG (Noun 33): 76 hours, 59 minutes, 31.54 seconds.
Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s): x, +382.3 (+116.5); y, -104.3 (-31.8); z, -8.4 (-2.6). These velocities are expressed with respect to the Local Vertical/Local Horizontal frame of reference of the Moon.
Spacecraft attitude: Roll, 246°; Pitch, 208°; Yaw, 62°. The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform which itself, as indicated in the notes would still be aligned per the PTC REFSMMAT.
HA, expected apogee of resulting orbit (Noun 44): Not applicable. The spacecraft would be on a trajectory coming from the Moon so any apogee figure would be meaningless.
HP, expected perigee of resulting orbit (Noun 44): +21.2 nautical miles (+39.3 km). The perigee distance is so low, it intersects the Earth's atmosphere. In other words, the spacecraft will re-enter.
Delta-VT: 396.4 fps ( m/s). This is the total change in velocity the spacecraft would experience. (It is a vector sum of the three components given above.)
Burn duration or burn time: 56 seconds.
Delta-VC: 391.2 fps (119.2 m/s). The crew enter this figure into their EMS Delta-V counter display. The EMS can shut down the engine using this data if the G&N system fails to do so. Its value is lower to allow for the extra thrust imparted by the engine after shutdown, a quantity allowed for the the G&N software but not by the EMS.
Sextant star: Star 22 (Regulus, Alpha Leonis) visible in sextant when shaft and trunnion angles are 211.7° and 8.7° respectively. This is part of an attitude check.
The next three items are not applicable.
The next five parameters all relate to re-entry, during which an important milestone is "Entry Interface," defined as being 400,000 feet (121.92 km) altitude. In this context, a more important milestone is when atmospheric drag on the spacecraft imparts a deceleration of 0.05 g.
Expected splashdown point (Noun 61): 27.86° south, 168.02° west; in the mid-Pacific.
Range to go at the 0.05 g event: 1,149.8 nautical miles. To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance the CM would travel from the 0.05 g event to landing. This figure will be decremented by the EMS based on signals from its own accelerometer.
Expected velocity at the 0.05 g event: 36,159 fps. This is another entry for the EMS. It is entered into the unit's Delta-V counter and will be decremented based on signals from its own accelerometer.
Predicted GET of 0.05 g event: 165 hours, 12 minutes and 25 seconds GET.
GDC Align stars: Stars to be used for GDC Align purposes are 15 (Sirius, and 12 (Rigel,). The align angles are roll, 230°; pitch, 170°; yaw, 2°.
As the SPS tanks would be essentially full, no ullage burn is required settle their contents. The expectation is that the LM will still be docked and they have a figure for its mass from a previous PAD. The final note reminds them that it assumes their platform is algned per the PTC REFSMMAT.

036:11:45 Mitchell: Houston, 14. Go ahead.
036:11:49 Haise: I just wanted to see if you all are still around there. You all been looking out the window lately back in this direction? Seen anything interesting?
036:12:01 Mitchell: No, I haven't looked out for a while. Got something interesting for us to look at?
036:12:07 Haise: I was asking you - if you had seen anything from that vantage point. Pretty dark down here where I am right now. [Pause.]
036:12:25 Mitchell: It's been an hour or so, Fred, since I took a look at either back in your direction or at the Moon. Let me see if I can see where you are now. [Long pause.]
036:12:58 Haise: Guesstimation on the terminator ought to be somewhere around India, Pakistan; somewhere in that - along that line.
036:13:09 Mitchell: Okay.
Comm break.
036:14:29 Mitchell: Houston, 14. We have the Moon out the hatch window right now, Freddo.
036:14:37 Haise: Okay.
036:14:41 Mitchell: And I presume then that the Earth is probably out the port telescope at this moment.
036:14:51 Haise: I guess you'll have to wait about another 20 minutes or so for it to come up in the hatch.
036:14:57 Mitchell: Rog. Yeah, I suspect also it's down just a little bit too far for us to see.
036:15:07 Haise: Let's see, how big a Moon are you seeing there? Is it about not quite a half or something?
036:15:16 Mitchell: Rog. It's short of a half; and, for size, it appears about like an orange held at - short of - just short of arm's length. About - it subtends about a degree and a half now, a little less.
036:15:38 Haise: Roger. [Pause.] Yeah, and the board here has you at about 135,000 out now.
036:15:52 Mitchell: Okay, that'll make it slightly over a degree then, I guess. [Long pause.]
036:16:26 Mitchell: As you already know, Fred, the Moon starts to take on a little bit of brown - grayish colors about this point, as opposed to being so very bright as it appears from the Earth. You can start to see a little bit of texture here. [Pause.]
Less than a year ago in April 1970, Fred occupied the same seat on Apollo 13 and would have been able to make similar observations.
036:16:48 Haise: Yeah, that's a good word to remember, that texture business.
036:16:55 Mitchell: Yeah.
Comm break.
036:18:00 Mitchell: And, Fred, I have the monocular on the Moon now out window 5, and it - it's really starting to look very interesting from this point of view. [Pause.]
036:18:21 Haise: And it'll look a little better in a couple of days.

036:21:45 Mitchell: I have the Home Planet out the hatch window now, and where did you say the terminator is?
036:21:52 Haise: Oh, guesstimation is somewhere between the Sudan and the India.
036:22:01 Mitchell: Rog. [Pause.]
036:22:06 Haise: And, looking at your position, overhead here, you ought to have - Philippines - mainland, the Far East there, in sight.
Mission Control has the use of a UNIVAC 1148 computer which has the capability of creating a simulation of the view from the spacecraft window at any given point in their trajectory. This includes simulating the vievable portion of the surface of the Earth and the Moon.
Comm break.
036:23:14 Mitchell: As a matter of fact, I do, Fred. There is quite a bit of cloud cover, and I'm having a little difficulty identifying landmasses. I'll be able to pick it up by the next time around here.
036:23:26 Haise: Okay. [Long pause.]
036:24:21 Haise: And, 14; Houston. [Pause.]
036:24:30 Mitchell: Go ahead.
036:24:31 Haise: Yeah. I was trying to give you a sunrise terminator there, Ed. I guess from your - I got some pictures here that tells me that what you're probably looking at is the sunset terminator, and that's running right through Australia and right across the coast of China.
036:24:51 Mitchell: Okay. Rog. That makes a lot more sense of it; I'm pretty sure I had the Australian continent down at the bottom of my lighted area, and looking up across the Philippines. And there's a great deal of cloud cover in that area, but there are a few islands standing out. I believe that I can see the southern tip of India standing out without too much cloud on it.
036:25:23 Haise: Rog. India should be right about at the - the edge.
036:25:30 Mitchell: Rog.
Comm break.
036:27:08 Mitchell: Houston, 14.

036:27:26 Haise: Hey, I'll ask somebody about that one, Ed. [Pause.]
036:27:36 Mitchell: Part of it seems to be in darkness right now, but I seem to be seeing about half of a very large - circulating airmass.

036:30:46 Mitchell: The Home Planet's out of my field of view, now, Freddo.
036:30:51 Haise: Okay, stand by one, Ed. We've got kind of a bad comm right now.
Comm break.
036:32:25 Mitchell: Houston, Apollo 14. Are you there?
036:32:27 Haise: Okay, I think we may be back on good Omni now, Ed. Go ahead.
036:32:34 Mitchell: Okay, I didn't have...
036:32:42 Haise: Say that last again, Ed.
036:32:45 Mitchell: I say, I don't have very much viewing time on either the Moon or the Earth. As it swings past the window, it's very low; and I - we only have just a few minutes on each window. But it's a most inviting and magnificent view. I'm very glad we have Earth as a Home Planet. I hope we can keep it so it's inviting. [Pause.]
The view out of the spacecraft was surprisingly limited, even more so when they are docked with the LM. It was probably more like a window seat just in front of the wing of a passenger jet than a panoramic view of the vastness of space. Additionally, its constant rotation causes Earth and the Moon to only spend a short time in view in each window.
036:33:11 Haise: Roger, Ed. Yes, again looking up at the big board I can - need to get about another 40,000 miles or so, then you'll be more directly in the Earth/Moon plane, and you ought to have them pretty much centered in the window about then.
036:33:33 Mitchell: Okeydoke. Thank you.

036:40:09 Mitchell: Rog, Freddo. I'm watching - out the rendezvous, right-hand rendezvous window at the thermal skin on the LM. Right now - and it is in full-Sun outside my window - and I observed as the Sun came directly onto it [garble] bands of heat and then cools off and pops back into shape again as the - starts to cool off on the next cycle. It's - it gives a rippling effect as the Sun passes across it. It's very interesting.

036:42:38 Mitchell: Go ahead.
036:42:40 Haise: Okay, I heard a little bit of your onset there, Ed, before Omni B got us again with the bad comm there. And, I guess LM-8 got built just like LM-7, because I noticed that same sort of a thing there.
036:43:00 Mitchell: Yeah. I guess that's what it's all about. The thermal protection - expands from the heat and contracts. And, this is sure doing it on each cycle.
036:43:13 Haise: With respect to your weather question awhile ago, Ed, they say they do have a weak cyclonic storm to the west of Australia, but they're not showing anything to the east; and I - maybe I misunderstood, I thought you said you saw it over by the sunset terminator to the east.
036:43:39 Mitchell: Rog. It appeared to be up by the sunset terminator, Freddo. A very - like a donut-shaped cloud but several thousand miles across. It might have been too large for just the tropical storm they're talking about. Couldn't be a very widespread circulation.
036:44:01 Haise: Ah, I guess they need to go look out the window down there, too.
036:44:07 Mitchell: Okay.

039:08:45 Mitchell: I'm listening, Freddo.
039:08:47 Haise: Yes. I'm not maybe clear on a question you had earlier about the ball valves with respect to time in the burn on MCC-2, but I do have some data here. And I think the crux of it is - is that if you use a cue of the ball valves visually showing full Open to full Closed, you'll be shifting your - what you're actually starting and stopping your clock by about a quarter of a second from the actual chamber pressure. But the total Delta-Time is very close. On that burn, you would have clocked 10.15 versus 10.2 via PC. [Pause.]
039:09:49 Mitchell: Okay. You say had we measured PC we would have clocked 10.15. Is that affirm?
039:09:57 Haise: No. You'd have - from 90 percent PC down to 10 percent, you'd have got 10.2 seconds. And if you'd have started your watch with Bank A full Open to the Bank A needle showing full Closed, you'd have measured 10.15. Except in the time - absolute time scale, you would have started and stopped your watch one quarter second to the right. [Pause.] Because there is a lag in the - what I'm telling you is there... [Long pause.]
039:10:30 Mitchell: Okay.

This is Apollo Control; 39 hours, 59 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Flight surgeon just reported a few moments ago that apparently Lunar Module Pilot Ed Mitchell had unplugged his biomed harness and apparently was preparing to go to sleep. They're somewhat ahead of schedule on this particular item in that the rest period is not scheduled to begin until 41 hours Ground Elapsed Time, which is almost 2 hours from now. One hour from now, I beg your pardon. I don't see how it could be much quieter, whether they were asleep or awake, judging from the past several hours' sparse conversation. Apollo 14 now 140,147 nautical miles [259,552 km] out from Earth; velocity, 3,657 feet per second [1,115 m/s]. An update for S-IVB impact which was run at 37 hours approximately Ground Elapsed Time shows the impact point at 8 minutes, 52 - as you were 8 degrees, 52 minutes south; 25 minutes - 25 degrees, 51 minutes west at a Ground Elapsed Time of 82 hours, 37 minutes, 33 seconds. At 40 hours, 1 minute Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.

040:13:31 Haise: Okay. The PTC is divergent enough that it's not going to make it through the next - this upcoming sleep period. So we'd like for you to stop at about zero roll, and we'll reinitialize. In the interim, you can do any venting or dumping you might have to do and - before cranking it up again.
040:13:48 Shepard: [Garble] cockpit at the moment with the food and everything. We'll probably catch you the next [Garble] around. [Long pause.]
040:14:06 Haise: Okay. Okay. And either zero or 180 roll will be okay.
040:14:16 Shepard: Okay.
Comm break.
040:15:40 Haise: And, 14; Houston. Who's the duty cook tonight?
040:15:47 Shepard: Ed Mitchell's in the pantry right now.
Their evening meal selection, per crewman, consisted of: Commander: Cream of chicken soup, Frankfurters, banana pudding, brownies, pineapple-grapefruit drink. Command Module Pilot: potato soup, meatballs with sauce, chicken and rice, peanut cubes, pineapple-grapefruit drink. Lunar Module Pilot: Identical to Commander's.
Very long comm break.

040:26:44 Shepard: Go ahead, Houston.
040:26:46 Haise: Okay. We'd like H2 - H2 tank number 2 to Auto.
040:26:53 Shepard: Okay. H2 number 2 going to Auto now.
040:26:56 Haise: Okay, that's a heater switch, Al.

This is Apollo Control at 41 hours, 25 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. According to Flight Surgeon Willard Hawkins and here in Mission Control, the only one still apparently awake is Commander Shephard aboard Apollo 14 and he apparently is settling down into the easy rhythmic breathing of one going to sleep, but Roosa and Mitchell apparently have been asleep for some time. Apollo 13 - Apollo 14 now 143,114 nautical miles [265,047 km] from Earth. Travelling at a velocity of 3,568 feet per second [1,088 m/s]. At this time we will take down the air-to-ground circuit and should the crew wake up and make a call back to the control center, we will tape this for delayed playback. At 41 hours, 26 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.

041:32:45 Shepard: Houston, 14. We are ready with our crew status report and with a Verb 74.
041:32:55 Fullerton: 14, Houston. Got a new CapCom now. Stand by 1 before you start that - report.
041:33:04 Shepard: Okay.
This is Apollo Control at 41 hours, 33 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apparently not everyone is asleep up there, cause we had a call just a moment ago offering the crew status and on board read outs so we'll play catch up with the tape and go live as quickly as we get through the brief burst of tape. Lets go.
Long comm break.

New CapCom referred to is Gordon Fullerton who is replacing Fred Haise at the CapCom's console. Some handover going on here in the room. Pete Frank being briefed by the outgoing Flight Director Gerry Griffin, who will be coming to the news center as soon as the handover is complete for briefing on God only knows what, but at any rate he'll be coming over that way. We're standing by live on air-ground at 41:35.
041:36:07 Roosa: And - Houston, 14.
041:36:10 Fullerton: 14, Houston. Go ahead.
041:36:14 Roosa: Okay, Gordon. Fred made his comment before you left, I guess you're - wanting us to reestablish PTC before we sack out. Is that affirm?
041:36:24 Fullerton: Affirmative.
041:36:27 Roosa: Okay.
Comm break.

041:39:05 Fullerton: Apollo 14, Houston.
041:39:10 Roosa: Go ahead, Houston.
041:39:13 Fullerton: Roger. We're waiting for a good Omni to come up before starting that E-memory dump. One reminder is to complete all dumping before you - try to start the PTC again. And a question. With respect to the O2 Flow High problems you had yesterday and any that you might have had since, we're wondering if you're doing anything - different than normal procedures as far as the - waste management overboard drain or any other - outside drains that control O2 Flow High problem. Over.
041:39:56 Roosa: That's a negative on the - procedures. We're not doing anything unusual there. And, we haven't had any problems today. The O2 flow you saw a minute ago was when we were pumping up the cabin to 5 7. And - as far as the ones that - we had yesterday, we really don't have that psyched out.
041:40:12 Fullerton: Roger, Stu. [Pause.]
041:40:29 Fullerton: 14, Houston. We're ready for the EMOD dump.
041:40:35 Roosa: Okay, Gordon. Verb 74, and coming at you.
041:40:42 Fullerton: Roger. [Long pause.]
'EMOD dump' refers to the practice of allowing Mission Control to dump the contents of the computer's erasable memory, all 2K of it, to Earth so that its contents can be inspected. As best as we have found, EMOD stands for Erasable Memory Octal Dump and it is initialised by Verb 74.
041:41:07 Fullerton: Apollo 14, Houston. We're ready to copy your crew status report and onboard readouts. Over. [Long pause.]
041:41:24 Shepard: Okay. With respect to the crew status, it's excellent. We have a negative medical report. Bat C is 37.0; Pyro A, 37.2; Pyro B, 37.2; RCS A, 87; RCS B, 89; C, 86; D, 88. That was taken at 041:20:00.
041:41:56 Fullerton: Roger, Al. Would you say Bat - C voltage again?
041:42:03 Shepard: 37.0.
041:42:05 Fullerton: Roger. We copy all those. [Long pause.]
041:42:27 Unidentified speaker: Go ahead.

041:58:10 Roosa: Go ahead, Houston.
041:58:12 Fullerton: Roger. We're within rate limits and it looks like a good place to start the roll rates for PTC.
041:58:22 Roosa: Okay. We're going to hang loose here for a few minutes before we spin it up.
041:58:27 Fullerton: Roger, Stu. [Long pause.]
041:59:13 Fullerton: Apollo 14, Houston.
041:59:19 Roosa: Go ahead, Houston.
041:59:21 Fullerton: Stu, when you do get ready to spin up, let us know before you do, and we'll catch it at a good point to start it and give you a Go. Over.
041:59:31 Roosa: Okay. That sounds like a good plan. We want to make sure that we've got all the activity quieted down before we spin up.
041:59:39 Fullerton: Roger.
