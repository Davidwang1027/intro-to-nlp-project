There's been no rest for the crew of Apollo 14, despite enjoying their first good look on the lunar surface up close. The Descent Orbit Insertion burn has shaped their orbit into an elliptical one, with the lowest point taking them mere 9 nautical miles - 17 km - above their target of Fra Mauro. Everything still looks good to go for the third manned lunar landing the next day.
Editor's note: All transcript times are presented according to the GET update at 054:53:36 that saw the mission timer moved forward 40 minutes, 2.90 seconds.
Apollo Control, Houston. The first radar data solutions say Apollo 14 has a good orbit. We'll stand by continue to monitor. We're at 87 hours 22 minutes Ground Elapsed Time.
MSFN data says we're stay.
087:23:20 Fullerton: Apollo 14, Houston. You have a stay. We're still evaluating the orbit to give you the precise numbers. Over.
They are now tracking the spacecraft from Earth to determine its exact orbit around the Moon.
087:23:31 Shepard: Good show. That sounds good to us. We're here.
087:23:34 Mitchell: We all thank you.
087:23:37 Roosa: And, Gordon, are we clear to start our maneuver then?
087:23:42 Fullerton: That's affirmative.
Comm break.
That exuberant response coming from Al Shepard. Then Lunar Module Pilot, Ed Mitchell, joining in. We're at 87 hours 24 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
Apollo Control, Houston. Ground elapsed time of 87 hours 26 minutes. A preliminary look at the data here on the ground shows an orbit of 59 nautical miles [109 km] by 9.3 nautical miles [17.2 km].
087:26:27 Fullerton: Apollo 14, Houston.
087:26:32 Shepard: Go ahead, Houston.
087:26:34 Fullerton: We've got you in a 9.3 by 59.0. [Long pause.]
087:26:46 Shepard: Okay. Sounds pretty good; 9.3 by 59.0.
087:26:51 Fullerton: Roger. [Long pause.]
087:27:10 Shepard: I guess we could make it down from here tomorrow.
087:27:13 Fullerton: Roger.
Long comm break.
Apollo Control, Houston. 87 hours 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We repeat that it appears Apollo 14 had a good DOI burn. Ground data shows an orbit of 59 nautical miles [109 km] by 9.3 nautical miles [17.2 km]. Apollo 14 is stay in this orbit. DOI was planned for Apollo 13, but, of course, not used. Therefore, Command Module Pilot Stu Roosa, has descended closer to the lunar surface than any other previous Apollo crew members occupying his seat. 87 hours 30 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
The PAO's remark refers to the fact that on the earlier lunar landings of Apollo 11 and 12, the Lunar Module's DPS engine was used to perform the DOI burn after undocking, while the Command Service Module remained on a higher orbit.
087:30:26 Mitchell: Houston, 14.
087:30:30 Fullerton: Go ahead, Ed. You're just [Garble] now. We're just about to lose the antenna. [Long pause.]
087:31:08 Mitchell: Houston, Apollo 14.
087:31:11 Fullerton: Roger, Ed. Go ahead.
087:31:16 Mitchell: Okay. Now for the first time we saw an Earthrise over the LM; we're sighting at you along the righthand rendezvous window, and it's a beautiful sight to see the Earth from here. And you are - just have risen over the LM number 4 quad - no, number 1 quad. [Long pause.]
087:31:44 Fullerton: Roger.
Long comm break.
087:37:07 Mitchell: Houston, 14.
087:37:10 Fullerton: Go ahead, Ed.
087:37:16 Mitchell: Looks like we're getting mighty low down here. It's an entirely different sight from the higher altitude. We're coming across the - we're just now over the Crater Gutenberg. At this point, it's out my back window.
The large crater Gutenberg is located on the southwestern edge of Mare Fecunditatis. It is named after the German printing pioneer Johannes Gutenberg (1390-1468).
087:37:33 Fullerton: Roger. We're following your course on the map here.
087:37:35 Mitchell: Those brown rocks - those brown mountains look like they have a nice soft blanket on them from altitude. They look very harsh, but the regolith looks smoother and more hummocky than quite so angular and sharp. [Long pause.]
Ed describes their sights in many basic lunar geoloical terms. A blanket is a covering of rock material spread about by a nearby impact. Regolith is a term for the soil that covers the lunar surface, consisting of rock fragments from microscopic dust to boulders. A 'hummocky' landscape consists of continuous rolling hills.
087:38:03 Fullerton: Roger.
Comm break.
087:39:27 Mitchell: Houston, we're just along side the Crater Isidorus at this point, and we're trying to follow this on the smaller chart.
Crater Isidorus is located alongside crater Capella in the highland terrain north of Mare Nectaris. They are located west of the previously spotted Gutenberg crater.
087:39:37 Fullerton: Roger.
Long comm break.
087:47:11 Fullerton: Apollo 14, Houston. Over.
087:47:16 Mitchell: Go ahead, Houston.
087:47:18 Fullerton: In about 4 minutes, you'll be at your minimum altitude, which should be about 40,000 feet above the terrain. We're wondering how things look down there. [Long pause.]
087:47:36 Mitchell: Well, I'm glad to hear you say we're that high. It looks like we're quite a bit lower as a matter of fact - below some of the peaks on the horizon, although that's only an illusion.
087:47:52 Fullerton: Roger.
087:47:53 Mitchell: The surface appears to be a lot smoother down here where we can see - closer to the detail and, of course, particularly at this higher Sun angle, it appears to be a softer surface, but it certainly is an unusual sensation flying this low. [Long pause.]
087:48:16 Fullerton: Roger.
087:48:21 Mitchell: Houston, it looks like that I'm looking right up the angular rille by - in the Crater Hipparchus. This - this country down here is really rugged at this altitude. The rille looks like to me a drop had been dropped down 10,000 feet. It was just another map [?]. [Long pause.]
Crater Hipparchus - named after the ancient Greek astronomer - is famously the landing site of the fictional explorers in the Belgian Tintin cartoon "Explorers on the Moon", published in 1954.
087:48:55 Fullerton: Roger, Ed. [Long pause.]
087:49:21 Fullerton: Stu, you're about 25 seconds from picking up H-3.
087:49:31 Roosa: Okay, thank you. I'm looking.
According to the Flight Plan, landmark H-3 is located at 3.691°S, 7.542°W with an elevation given as zero with respect to the lunar datum.
Comm break.
087:50:52 Mitchell: Houston, the scale is so deceiving we could be 500 feet in the air from the way this terrain looks [Garble] Scale it down a little bit.
087:51:02 Fullerton: Roger. [Long pause.]
087:51:37 Mitchell: I'm looking down inside the Crater Mösting.
Crater Mösting and its satellite craters are named after the Danish banker Johan von Mösting (1759-1843), a benefactor to astronomy.
087:51:45 Fullerton: Roger. And, Stu, your TCA, minus 20 seconds now. [Long pause.]
087:52:03 Mitchell: Mösting is a bench crater with an almost vertical drop on the east side of it. [Garble] one side [Garble] the west side. And it looks like solid rock on both sides.
087:52:20 Fullerton: Roger.
087:52:21 Mitchell: And, soft regolith near - rubbly at all.
087:52:26 Fullerton: Roger.
087:52:27 Roosa: Okay, Gordon. How do you read?
087:52:29 Fullerton: Loud and clear, Stu.
087:52:33 Roosa: Okay. Well, that turned out to be a piece of cake. At a very low angle, Ed, located by coming off of points B and BA and about 51:05 or 51:10 on this clock, the elevation angle was enough that I could pick up Main Street. And, just for your info, using high speed, I could track it just smooth as glass all the way through even though we're in inertial attitude. And, it looks relatively easy. I think 14-2 ought to really be a piece of cake. [Long pause.]
087:53:14 Fullerton: Roger; sounds good. [Long pause.]
087:53:36 Roosa: Gordon - the optics, even at this low altitude, tracking the landmarks is rather phenomenal. You can just keep it right on there at high speed, just as smooth.
087:53:52 Fullerton: Roger, Stu. [Long pause.]
087:54:12 Fullerton: Stu, Ron is with me here. He was curious about how good the initial pointing accuracy of the optics is. Over.
087:54:24 Roosa: Okay. Well, it - I think it was right on the money. When they first came up, it was pretty bright, and the background release on H-3, that ridge right behind it, did not show up out in the flat surface as much as I would have hoped. And, of course, I've got the LM there, too. I couldn't pick it up until the trunnion got down to about 31 or 32 degrees. The optics were right in the area. I think they were a little high. But, I came off, like I say, off of Mösting B and BA, and got - I picked it up at a fairly low elevation, I believe. And, then as soon as we came upon them a little bit, why we're right there. And, then I - then I tracked them with the high speed and I never gave it back to the CMC. [Long pause.]
087:55:17 Fullerton: Roger.

Apollo Control Houston. The Ground Elapsed Time 87 hours 56 minutes. Again predicted versus actual times were close. We predicted that GET for the descent orbit insertion of 86 hours 50 minutes 54.97 seconds. The actual time for ignition 86 hours 50 minutes 54.97 seconds. Delta-V predicted was 206.4 feet per second [62.9 m/s]. Delta-V actual as logged by our Flight Dynamics Officer 205.7 feet per second [62.7 m/s]. The burn time predicted 20.8 seconds. Actual 20.7 seconds.
We're advised that the highest mountain near pericynthion is at 7.6 degrees east and has an elevation of 2.9 nautical miles [5.4 km]. We're up to 87 hours 57 minutes into the flight. Our displays now show Apollo...
087:57:29 Fullerton: Ed, this is Houston. And I have a map update for you, Rev 4.
087:57:39 Mitchell: Okay. Go ahead.
087:57:42 Fullerton: Roger. The 180 time is 88:46:55. LOS and AOS are within a minute. Over. [Long pause.]
087:57:58 Mitchell: Okay. LOS and AOS within a minute, and the 180 is 88:46:55.
087:58:05 Fullerton: That's correct.
087:58:08 Roosa: And, Houston, Houston; 14.
087:58:11 Fullerton: Go ahead.
087:58:15 Roosa: Okay, Gordon. Even without being dark adapted, just coming off with my eye glued on the optics coming across the Sun, you can see a very definite horizon through the optics here in Earthshine. And - can pick out the - the rims of the - of the bright - bright craters and craters that do have bright rims on them. And - I'm sure if you were really dark adapted you could see quite a bit through the optics scanners. [Long pause.]
087:58:54 Fullerton: Roger, Stu. That's - that's interesting. [Long pause.]
087:59:09 Shepard: Of course, with the naked eye, you can see excellent horizon and Earthshine. I'm looking, for example, to the south at the moment and have a very clear horizon in that direction.
087:59:20 Fullerton: Roger, Al. [Long pause.]
087:59:33 Mitchell: And, Houston, looking to the north, we see the same view. It's a very sharply defined horizon. I can see the stars. I got a - a very soft gray, well-lit surface below without too many features. You can't see sharply, just - not distinctly; but nothing's probably lost. [Long pause.]
087:59:59 Fullerton: Roger.

Apollo Control Houston, 88 hours Ground Elapsed Time. Our latest data shows Apollo 14 with an apolune of 58.8 nautical miles [108.9 km] perilune 9.6 nautical miles [17.8 km].
088:05:05 Roosa: Okay, Gordon, the angles were torqued at 88:05 and I guess you got them.
088:05:13 Fullerton: Roger. 88:05. We got them.
This is Stu's 12th P52 realignment of the guidance platform during the flight. As a reference, he sighted on star 16 (Procyon) and star 20 (Dnoces). As a check of his sighting accuracy, the computer compared the measured angle between these stars and the actual angle. The difference between them was 000.01 degrees. Finally, the computer displayed Noun 93, the angles by which the gimbals would be rotated or 'torqued' to restore perfect alignment. These were -0.031° in X, 0.002° in Y and 0.027° in Z axis. According to the post-flight Mission Report, the platform was torqued at 88:05 GET.

088:08:16 Fullerton: Apollo 14, Houston.
088:08:21 Mitchell: Go ahead, Houston.
088:08:23 Fullerton: We'd like a word from you on whether or not you indeed got a guided shutdown on the DOI burn or whether you think you might have beat it slightly. Over. [Long pause.]
088:08:45 Shepard: I thought I made that clear when I gave you the burn report on the G&N shutdown. The Delta-V switches were turned very definitely after the cut-off of the G&N.
088:09:01 Fullerton: Okay, Al.
088:09:03 Shepard: Your people have put this in full eyeball. We had two pairs of eyeballs watching that very carefully.
088:09:14 Fullerton: Roger, Al. Thank you.
088:09:23 Roosa: Hey, Gordon. I'd say the PC was falling through about - at a maximum of about 25, when I moved the switches.
088:09:34 Fullerton: Roger.
Long comm break.
088:18:50 Music (onboard): (Music - "Truck Driving Man")
Apollo Control Houston at 88 hours 18 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We show just a little over 2 minutes away now from loss of signal with Apollo 14, as Apollo 14 will pass over the back side of the Moon.
088:19:03 Mitchell (onboard): What is that?
088:19:03 Fullerton: Apollo 14, Houston.
088:19:09 Shepard: Go ahead, Houston.
088:19:12 Fullerton: About a minute to go to LOS. And one final reminder for Stu as he sets up the topo camera: don't forget to pull the pit pin.
088:19:28 Shepard: Okay ...
088:19:29 Roosa: Okay. Gordon. Oh, ye of little faith. But no sweat. I'll holler a reminder.
088:19:34 Fullerton: Okay.
Very long comm break.
Apollo Control, Houston. 88 hours 21 minutes into the flight. We've had loss of signal with Apollo 14. As the spacecraft now passing over the far side of the Moon on this the third revolution. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
088:19:48 Mitchell (onboard): He could interpret that to mean don't give you those little reminders.
088:20:06 Shepard (onboard): Now, there's a good song. What's the name of that son of a bitch?
088:20:10 Roosa (onboard): "Truck Driving Man."
088:20:13 Mitchell (onboard): Can I put this under here? It's the only one I've got big enough to hold it.
088:20:15 Shepard (onboard): Yes. Go ahead.
088:20:17 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
088:20:33 Mitchell (onboard): I knew lunch was a little short today.
088:20:37 Shepard (onboard): Well, they knew we were going to be busy.
088:20:40 Mitchell (onboard): Yes. Yes, we didn't (cough) ...
088:20:41 Shepard (onboard): We don't get any wetpacks tonight, huh?
088:20:52 Mitchell (onboard): I'm going to have to look again. I thought we did.
088:21:00 Shepard (onboard): I'll check it.
088:21:11 Shepard (onboard): Yes, I might use a blue bag tonight.
088:21:16 Mitchell (onboard): Well, I'm sure going to try. Hell, you ...
The 'blue bag' is apparently the crew's nickname for the 'Fecal Collection Assembly'. The process of using one was cumbersome, and involved opening a rear flap on their full body jumpsuit underwear, sticking the bag in place with two-sided tape, and performing labour-intensive aftercare with tissues and a pouch of disinfectant that had to be manually mixed with the produced solid wastes.
The medical record lists 1 sample from Commander, three from the LMP, four for the Command Module Pilot, and one 'unlabeled'.
088:21:23 Shepard (onboard): Day - day - day 4, meal C?
088:21:27 Mitchell (onboard): Yes, that's those other ones we have ...
088:21:29 Shepard (onboard): It says a greef-and-bav - beef-and-gravy wetpack. Stu's supposed to have a beef-and-gravy wetpack.
Tonight's evening meal is a beef and gravy wet pack.
088:21:38 Mitchell (onboard): And I'm supposed to have a beef-and-gravy wetpack.
088:21:41 Shepard (onboard): Stu, you're supposed to eat wetpacks tonight.
088:21:52 Roosa (onboard): Well, they gave me too much hot stuff.
088:22:03 Shepard (onboard): We start over again after tonight.
088:22:07 Mitchell (onboard): Yes?
088:22:12 Shepard (onboard): How many days of food do we have in there before we have to start making our own?
The food supply for the mission was two-fold. For the first five days, they each ate a personalized menu consisting of three pre-planned meals per day. For the rest of the mission, a pantry type selection was provided from where the crew could pick what they wished to eat on each meal.
088:22:50 Shepard (onboard): Would you pull our wetpacks out of there, babe?
088:22:58 Shepard (onboard): Stu?
088:22:59 Roosa (onboard): Huh?
088:23:00 Shepard (onboard): We're supposed to have three wetpacks out of there.
088:23:02 Roosa (onboard): Out of here?
088:23:03 Shepard (onboard): Yes, beef and gravy.
088:23:24 Roosa (onboard): (Singing)
088:23:39 Roosa (onboard): Yes, that must have been the beef and gravy that I ate for lunch. I guess I'll eat that damn spaghetti.
088:23:45 Shepard (onboard): I'll eat the spaghetti.
Three portions of rehydratable spaghetti with meat sauce are listed in the spacecraft's pantry menu.
088:23:46 Roosa (onboard): No, no; I - I'm not going to bitch about the food. I just won't eat it (laughter). I won't bitch.
088:24:06 Roosa (onboard): Somebody watching my Flight Plan while we're ...
088:24:08 Mitchell (onboard): Yes.
088:24:11 Shepard (onboard): Watch your what?
088:24:13 Roosa (onboard): What time do we do something?
088:24:15 Mitchell (onboard): We start maneuvering, 6 minutes.
088:24:16 Shepard (onboard): [Garble.]
088:24:25 Roosa (onboard): Oh, I'm sorry.
088:24:30 Shepard (onboard): Babies stay pretty cool in that stuff - place in there.
The wet packs are stored frozen in an insulated box that is meant to keep them cold for the duration of the trip - as long as the door isn't opened too frequently.
088:25:28 Shepard (onboard): We're going to use the hot water only?
088:25:30 Roosa (Onboard): What?
088:25:31 Shepard (onboard): Use the separator on the cold water - on the cold water only, right?
088:25:33 Roosa (onboard): Yes, I think that's the plan.
088:25:36 Shepard (onboard): Okay. Now let's see, you can put 3 ounces of hot in that baby. And I'll go up and unsnap the gun. Okay, that [Garble.]
088:25:55 Roosa (onboard): Oh, okay.
088:25:58 Shepard (onboard): [Garble.]
088:26:15 Mitchell (onboard): May I have the scissors a minute, or are you using them?
088:26:55 Mitchell (onboard): What are you doing, hot or cold now, Stu?
088:27:04 Shepard (onboard): He's doing the hot down there, Ed.
088:27:07 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. See if I get anything hot. Yes, there's a hot.
088:27:53 Music: (Music)
088:27:56 Shepard (onboard): Those guys actually sell any records of that stuff?
088:28:11 Shepard (onboard): Those guys actually sell many records of that stuff?
088:28:16 Roosa (onboard): He's got a TV show.
088:28:18 Shepard (onboard): Really?
Based on Stu' comments, the music being played is that of country star Buck Owens. (1929-2006) Owens' popularity among the astronaut corps was such that Apollo 16 LMP Charlie Duke even commissioned a special tape that was then taken to the Moon with Duke.
088:28:19 Roosa (onboard): Yes, it's been on several years. It's the hillbilly Laugh In? I don't know if you ever happen to pass by ...
088:28:27 Shepard (onboard): Yes, we saw that the other night.
088:28:31 Mitchell (onboard): What? Hee Haw?
Hee Haw was a variety show that had premiered in 1969 and ran in various forms until 1997. It was initially hosted by Buck Owens, and took inspiration from an earlier show called Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In', hence the comparison by Stu.
088:28:32 Roosa (onboard): You know, it's getting kind of hot in here. Is it to y'all?
088:28:39 Mitchell (onboard): down to 70.
This equals to 21 degrees Celsius. Reference materials suggest that the environmental control usually kept the temperature between 70 to 75 Fahrenheit, or 21.1 to 23.9 degrees Celsius.
088:28:40 Shepard (onboard): Flow's down, I don't know.
088:29:54 Mitchell (onboard): Probably ought to start a Verb 49 maneuver.
088:29:58 Shepard (onboard): Okay. Now we can do.
088:30:15 Shepard (onboard): Okay, it's going to be blunt end forward.
088:30:19 Roosa (onboard): What?
088:30:20 Shepard (onboard): Going to be blunt end forward. [Garble] changing around.
088:30:26 Roosa (onboard): Did they change that?
088:30:27 Mitchell (onboard): Yes.
088:30:31 Shepard (onboard):
088:30:36 Roosa (onboard): I wonder why in the hell they waited until now to do that.
088:30:38 Shepard (onboard): Seems kind of strange [Garble.]
088:30:41 Roosa (onboard): I mean that son of a bitch has been out for a long time.
088:30:44 Mitchell (onboard): Yes.
088:30:48 Shepard (onboard): Okay, we're in Rate Command; CMC, Auto. All the jets are on; B/D Roll. B/D Roll.
088:31:13 Shepard (onboard): We're moving.
088:31:18 Unknown crew member (onboard): (Music - "I've got a Tiger by the Tail," Buck Owens )
088:31:55 Shepard (onboard): (Laughter)
088:34:32 Roosa (onboard): I can't understand it.
088:34:45 Roosa (onboard): Are we doing what we're supposed to he doing, leader?
088:34:50 Shepard (onboard): [Garble] maneuver to 352.
088:34:52 Roosa (onboard): Okay.
088:34:53 Shepard (onboard): 146, 355.
088:35:00 Roosa (onboard): When do we get out the Hycon -
088:35:04 Mitchell (onboard): [Garble] camera in 10 minutes.
088:35:28 Unknown crew member (onboard): (Music)
088:35:57 Roosa (onboard): Another tissue box empty. I have to stow that -
088:36:30 Mitchell (onboard): Hey, Stu, will you grab that bag of yellow pills and toss them this way, please?
088:37:12 Mitchell (onboard): Get away from me, you noisy son of a hitch.
088:37:15 Roosa (onboard): Huh?
088:37:16 Mitchell (onboard): I told that noisy son of a bitch to float around somewhere else.
088:37:26 Roosa (onboard): You're not clear enough, I don't know, they got bad acoustics.
088:37:34 Mitchell (onboard): One thing about that, you can just let it float, and you can always find it.
088:38:36 Roosa (onboard): Why don't you turn it off, there, and save the battery? I need the switch system. Throw the tape over. Or did you do that?
088:38:47 Shepard (onboard): I'll get it in a minute.
088:38:57 Shepard (onboard): Flip it over and hear the other side?
088:39:00 Roosa (onboard): Yes, why don't you, if you don't mind. God, I didn't want to - didn't want to impose on you there.
088:39:15 Shepard (onboard): Yes, we'll do it. Seems to be something I'm missing in this country music.
088:39:32 Roosa (onboard): It's - Don't put the cap on it, Ed.
088:39:34 Mitchell (onboard): Huh?
088:39:35 Roosa (onboard): Don't put the cap on it; I'll take it.
088:39:38 Mitchell (onboard): Are you going to - you going to put something in the bag or are you going to ...
088:39:41 Roosa (onboard): No, I was going - No, go ahead, if you're using it. I was just going to give Myrtle a drink.
088:39:47 Mitchell (onboard): I'm going to give me one, too. Oh, hell.
088:40:12 Roosa (onboard): Why don't you let me use it while you're doing that?
088:40:23 Shepard (onboard): Recorder end up down there with you?
088:41:04 Roosa (onboard): Wish I'd had the camera out. I'd like taking a couple of pictures of those bright craters from that low orbit.
088:41:10 Mitchell (onboard): Yes.
088:41:11 Roosa (onboard): With that dark -
088:41:16 Unknown crew member (onboard): (Music)
088:41:29 Roosa (onboard): Who in the hell is that?
088:41:57 Mitchell (onboard): Oh, God!
088:42:17 Unknown crew member (onboard): (Music)
088:42:33 Roosa (onboard): Now that's country music. That's not uptown.
088:43:00 Shepard (onboard): You're right.
088:43:12 Shepard (onboard): Nothing uptown about that.
088:43:48 Shepard (onboard): Okay. We're here.
088:44:36 Shepard (onboard): Mom, I couldn't have said I like that. Terrible!
088:45:03 Mitchell (onboard): Well, Stu? We better get with it, baby.
088:45:10 Shepard (onboard): Better start configuring the camera. Finish dinner later.
088:45:24 Roosa (onboard): Yes. Why don't you let me finish this?
088:45:27 Mitchell (onboard): [Garble] one is terrible [Garble.]
088:45:29 Roosa (onboard): Well, I went to all the trouble, I'm going to eat something.
088:45:41 Roosa (onboard): [Garble] food packs are stuck [Garble.]
088:46:08 Roosa (onboard): That's a horrible record. Acoustics on it aren't any good.
088:46:13 Mitchell (onboard): In love.
088:46:18 Shepard (onboard): Funny, this Flight Plan calls for - later on, it calls for blunt end forward.
088:46:23 Roosa (onboard): What?
088:46:24 Shepard (onboard): It calls for front end forward. [Garble] Down here, later on, where it describes what to do, it calls for front end forward.
088:46:55 Shepard (onboard): Ugh.
088:46:59 Mitchell (onboard): Burn 180 degrees. [Garble.]
088:47:03 Note: BEGIN LUNAR REV .
Very long comm break.

088:47:08 Roosa (onboard): What?
088:47:09 Mitchell (onboard): [Garble] 180 degrees [Garble] 1 minute
088:47:14 Shepard (onboard): I'll give you a mark.
088:47:16 Roosa (onboard): Okay.
088:47:29 Shepard (onboard): Need some more of those.
088:47:31 Mitchell (onboard): Pardon?
088:47:43 Shepard (onboard): Okay, everybody, it's zero minutes. General quarters stations for the LTC. [Garble.]
088:47:52 Mitchell (onboard): Five seconds -
088:47:57 Mitchell (onboard): Mark.
088:48:45 Shepard (onboard): Okay.
088:48:51 Roosa (onboard): Got to put that up in the tunnel?
088:48:56 Mitchell (onboard): Everything else can remain, can't it?
088:49:00 Roosa (onboard): Yes.
088:50:39 Shepard (onboard): We need a grounding wire for this thing [Garble] any way. We used to have [Garble.]
088:50:43 Roosa (onboard): Altitude chamber only.
088:50:48 Shepard (onboard): This is big end forward, right?
088:50:49 Mitchell (onboard): Big end forward.
088:50:51 Shepard (onboard): Okay. What [Garble] in?

088:52:37 Roosa (onboard): I don't really like this strap that goes on around the magazine, because I don't want to have to piddle with it. I'm taking it off. It's a nogoodnik. That's ground use only. I didn't even think they were supposed to be on - on the flight - camera.
088:53:08 Mitchell (onboard): With all the fuss [Garble] wouldn't dare not have them on the flight camera. Okay, where does this go?
088:53:37 Mitchell (onboard): Okay, we got all the lines hooked?
088:53:44 Roosa (onboard): Okay, read them off.
088:53:46 Mitchell (onboard): Okay, we've got the vacuum line, the overboard drain ...
088:53:49 Roosa (onboard): We don't have a vacuum line, yet. Okay, now we have a vacuum line.

088:57:50 Roosa (onboard): Coarse time. Time was - time was - was 13:21. 13 [Garble] 12, 13 - 13:21, 13:21 days. 7, 6, at a GET of 88:57:14.56. All right. Close up the camera [Garble] What? All right. Okay, we configured the camera. Target 9, Descartes. We did not get a PAD, did we? Initial range's going to be somewhere around 51. As a matter of fact, initial range will be 51.7. 51.7 at T-start.
088:59:29 Shepard (onboard): Did you get it up in time?
088:59:32 Roosa (onboard): Oh, yes. We've got a long way to wait.
088:59:34 Shepard (onboard): Okay, good.
088:59:37 Roosa (onboard): Okay, configure camera shutter: 1/200ths; range is on the PAD, 51.7; intervalometer is 65. Going to bang them off one a second.

We'll get a tweak on this, I'm sure; 146 and 355. We're configured for big end forward. It's in the number 3 window, and it is the LTC camera.
089:01:01 Shepard (onboard): [Garble.]
089:01:03 Roosa (onboard): Okay, we'll get a tweak to the maneuver. We'll get a PAD, and we'll be in business.
089:04:11 Shepard (onboard): I guess you don't have any yellow pills, do you?
089:04:18 Roosa (onboard): One yellow pill.
089:04:19 Shepard (onboard): Well, do you need it?
089:04:20 Roosa (onboard): No. I got one. I brought it up here, but I got one on this cocoa [Garble.]
089:04:29 Mitchell (onboard): There's your [Garble] right behind you.
089:04:59 Roosa (onboard): Where do they have those, down in the pantry?
089:05:01 Shepard (onboard): Yes. Okay. [Garble] AOS.
089:05:15 Mitchell (onboard): [Garble] because they're going to be passing PADs like crazy.
089:05:21 Shepard (onboard): [Garble.]
089:06:37 Roosa (onboard): Well, we have the Moon back out, going by Tsiolkovsky. And we're jaded already. Two Revs and we don't even jump to the window on sunrise.
089:06:56 Mitchell (onboard): We've had our second meal around the Moon.
089:07:00 Shepard (onboard): We what?
089:07:01 Mitchell (onboard): We've had our second ...
089:07:02 Shepard (onboard): We've had our first one.
089:07:03 Roosa (onboard): Huh? When was the first one?
089:07:04 Mitchell (onboard): We were eating during our first Rev.
089:07:11 Roosa (onboard): No, we weren't.
089:07:12 Mitchell (onboard): Hell we weren't! We were laying up here on the panel looking out the windows, and Al was passing food up. You were so excited that I guess you forgot it. That's what we were doing.
089:07:44 Roosa (onboard): Hey, Ed. Let me copy that topo PAD, so I'll make sure I - I've got it.
089:07:51 Mitchell (onboard): Be my guest.
089:07:52 Roosa (onboard): Yes, I want to -
Apollo Control Houston at 89 hours 8 minutes GET, we show that we're less than a minute away now from re-acquiring Apollo 14. We'll standby.
089:08:01 Shepard (onboard): You know, it sure does look like we're below the surface. You notice that, Ed?
089:08:10 Mitchell (onboard): What do you mean, Al? You mean to look out the window?
089:08:11 Shepard (onboard): Yes.
089:08:12 Mitchell (onboard): Yes. It does.
089:08:13 Roosa (onboard): Look at the horizon.
089:08:16 Mitchell (onboard): Like we're way down.
089:08:18 Shepard (onboard): Some of those near craters stick up in the way of the far craters. Mighty low.
089:08:36 Shepard (onboard): We ought to be able to see Cone Crater fairly easily, though, for whatever it's worth.
089:08:43 Mitchell (onboard): I think so.
089:08:49 Shepard (onboard): Cone and Star and Sunrise.
089:08:51 Mitchell (onboard): Give me that AOS time again, Stu.
089:08:54 Roosa (onboard): About 08 or thereabouts.
089:08:55 Mitchell (onboard): Well, it's already 09.
089:08:59 Roosa (onboard): Well, that's a wag [sic]. It says about 08.
089:09:03 Mitchell (onboard): There we go.
089:09:14 Mitchell: Houston, Apollo 14. How do you read?
089:09:23 Fullerton: Apollo 14, Houston. Go ahead.
089:09:28 Mitchell: Roger. Read you loud and clear here.
089:09:31 Fullerton: You're loud and clear, Ed, and ...
089:09:33 Mitchell: We're standing by to copy map updates and photo PADs.
089:09:36 Fullerton: Okay. You're way ahead of me. Map updates for Rev 10. 180 is 100:09:52; the LOS and AOS are within a minute. Over. [Long pause.]
089:09:58 Mitchell: Okay. [Long pause.]
089:10:10 Roosa: Okay, Gordon. We've got that; 100:09:52.
089:10:15 Fullerton: Okay, Stu. And the LTC photo PAD. Target 9, Descartes. I guess we gave you a new attitude some time ago, and we're going to change it slightly to - The latest version is: roll, 344; pitch, 145; and yaw, 350. T-start is 089:34:36. T-stop, 89:40:41. And I read six ranges going down the line. First one is 53.9, 55.2, 47.7, 40.7, 38.0, 34.9. Over.
Comm break.
089:11:34 Roosa: Okay, Gordon. Reading roll, pitch, yaw: 344, 145, 350. T-start: 089:34:36. T-stop: 089:40:41. Ranges: 53.9, 55.2, 47.7, 40.7, 38.0, and 34.9. [Long pause.]
089:12:05 Fullerton: Okay, Stu. Readback's correct. I have a TEI-12 PAD, when somebody's ready. [Long pause.]
089:12:36 Mitchell: Go ahead for TEI-12.
089:12:38 Fullerton: Okay. We have a state vector; we'd like P00 and Accept, when you can give it to us for that.
089:12:51 Mitchell: You've got it.
089:12:53 Fullerton: Roger. Okay, TEI-12, SPS/G&N; 36702; minus 0.62, plus 0.21. TIG is 105:53:44.96; Noun 81: plus 3424.3, plus 1176.3, minus 0216.6; 181, 095, 020. Ullage is four jets, 11 seconds. Remark: burn undocked; and number 2 is - assumes no Circ. Over.
Comm break.
089:14:29 Mitchell: Roger, Gordon. It's TEI-12, SPS/G&N; 36702; minus 0.62, plus 0.21; 105:53:44.96; plus 3424.3, plus 1176.3, minus 0216.6; 181, 095, 020; four jet, 11; burn undocked, and assumes no Circ burn. [Long pause.]
An interpretation of the PAD follows:
Purpose: The burn would be carried out at the end of Rev-12 in case the mission had to be aborted.
System: It would use the large SPS (Service Propulsion System) engine at the rear of the Service Module, under the control of the Guidance and Navigation system.
CSM Weight (Noun 47): 36,702 pounds (16,648 kg).
Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48): -0.62° and +0.21°. These angles represent an initial direction for the gimbal-mounted engine in order to fire through the predicted centre of mass of the spacecraft.
Time of ignition, TIG (Noun 33): 105 hours, 53 minutes, 44.96 seconds. As with all the TEI PADs, the burn is timed for when the spacecraft is over the farside.
Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s): X, +3,424.3 (+1,043.7); Y, +1,176.3 (+358.5); Z, -216.6 (-66.0). The change in velocity is resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the local vertical. The large positive X component shows that this burn would be prograde, i.e. in the same direction as their orbital motion, increasing their velocity so that they escape the gravitational pull of the Moon. The Y component indicates that the plane of their orbit would be changed to one which intersects Earth.
Spacecraft attitude: Roll, 181°; Pitch, 95°; Yaw, 20°. The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform.
Other items on the standard form are not applicable (NA) to this PAD. There are the following additional notes. SPS propellants would be settled in their tanks by firing the plus-X thrusters on all four quads around the Service Module for 11 seconds. The burn data assumes that the CSM is no longer carrying the weight of the LM and that they would be aborting the mission from the descent orbit, not having carried out the circularisation manoeuvre.
089:15:04 Fullerton: Roger, Ed. You make a good stenographer. The readback's correct.
089:15:13 Mitchell: Thank you. Boss tells me I don't have the looks for it.
089:15:22 Fullerton: Roger. [Long pause.]
Apollo Control Houston. 89 hours 16 minutes GET. The LTC is the Hycon lunar topography camera. Descartes, which will be the subject for this upcoming photographic exercise, is a strong candidate for a future Apollo mission.
089:16:10 Fullerton: 14, it's your computer.
089:16:15 Roosa: Okay. We got it.
Very long comm break.
Apollo Control Houston, 89 hours 18 minutes GET. Our display presently shows Apollo 14 at an altitude of 28.7 nautical miles [53.2 km] with an apolune of 59.1 nautical miles [109.5 km], a perilune of 9.2 nautical miles [17.0 km]. This is Apollo Control Houston.
Apollo Control Houston. 89 hours 31 minutes now into the flight - literally no contact with the crew on this front side pass except for the very beginning. This is the fourth revolution around the Moon. Stu Roosa undoubtedly quite busy with the lunar topography camera. The LTC is mounted in the crew access hatch window. And in Earth weight weighs 65 pounds.

That's Stu Roosa talking back and forth with capsule communicator Gordon Fullerton.
089:41:40 Roosa: All right, Gordon. We took them, changed the - the ranges by the time - times listed in your call, but there was some strange noises coming out of the - the magazine. Both - both sP00ls worked, and the frame counter ran, and the FMC worked. But there was sort of a clacking noise on the - in the magazine. It came on between frames 140 and 180, then went back to the Normal Mode, and then started again at frame 240, and went until the end of the film pass. And I'm reading 420 on the counter, was reading 5 when I started. I used five for the checkout. [Long pause.]
089:42:29 Fullerton: Okay, Stu. There was - was no change in operation when the - It looked like it was taking the pictures okay, just the funny noises. Is that all?
089:42:43 Roosa: Yes. It - it - it did - it did look like it was going all right. Like I say, the film wound up, and the FMC continued to work. However, when I went to Standby at the end, the FMC kept trying to drive. And, now the Mode switch in Standby, and I turned the power on. Instead of just getting the one flap over to the side, we'll have the FMC like you do normally, it wants to keep driving. [Long pause.]
089:43:14 Fullerton: Okay. Before you fold it up ...
089:43:16 Roosa: No, belay that, Gordon - Hey, belay that, Gordon. It doesn't - FMC does not keep driving, but that noise is - is still in there. May - maybe you can hear it here. I'll - I'll hold the mike down (machinegun-like noise). Okay. I don't know if you can get anything out of that or not, but that's with the sta - Mode switch in Standby and the power On. And, during that period of time, the FMC kicked a couple of times. It initially went off to the side like it does when you apply the power. And then, during that period of time that I had the transmitter down, the FMC did work twice with the Mode switch in Standby and power switch On. [Long pause.]
089:44:08 Fullerton: Okay, Stu, before you fold it all up, if it doesn't get in the way there, why don't you let me check with the back room and see if there's anything they want you to - else they want you to look at there, and I'll get back with you.
089:44:26 Roosa: Okay. And, another word here, with the - it did - like I - It worked normally up until about frame 140. But now, when I turn the power on; Mode, Standby, you get that - that clacking sound, and then intermittently the FMC kicks, and the frame counter moves, and we take a picture.
089:44:48 Fullerton: Roger. I understand that all wi - happens in Standby.
089:44:55 Roosa: That's affirm.
Long comm break.
089:48:13 Roosa: Hey, I'm getting a great look at my low-altitude landmarks, Gordon, from this low pass here.
089:48:19 Fullerton: Roger, Stu. [Long pause.]
089:48:31 Mitchell: Gordon, I can't even attempt to describe this, we're passing over it so rapidly. There's so much here to talk about.
089:48:39 Fullerton: Okay, Ed.
Long comm break.
89 hours 49 minutes. You heard that last report from Ed Mitchell. We presently show Apollo 14 at an altitude of 11.2 nautical miles [20.7 km] above the Moon.
089:52:51 Roosa: Houston, 14.
089:52:53 Fullerton: Go ahead, Stu.
089:52:58 Roosa: Okay. I'm going to go ahead and maneuver to the rest attitude, if you're agreeable.
089:53:05 Fullerton: Stand by. I'll check to be sure it's okay with everybody. [Long pause.]
089:53:24 Fullerton: Okay, Stu. You have a Go to maneuver.
089:53:27 Roosa: Okay.
Stu will use Verb 49 to tell the computer what attitude to take for their upcoming sleep period. By inputting the values of 126 roll, 286 pitch and 000 yaw, Stu can command the Digital Autopilot to fire their RCS jets until they assume that attitude.
Long comm break.
Apollo 14 now maneuvering to the rest attitude following Command Module Pilot Stu Roosa's request, which was certainly concurred upon here in Mission Control. The work day for 14 - the crew of Apollo 14 now essentially over. Coming up just ahead will be a breakfast period and then a rest period of some 8½ hours prior to tomorrow's very busy schedule.
089:56:50 Fullerton: Stu, this is Houston.
089:56:55 Roosa: Go ahead.
089:56:56 Fullerton: This is probably a - this is probably something you would have mentioned earlier, but we're wondering if there was any hint of that clacking noise on the other magazine that you checked out on translunar coast? Or was this the magazine that you used as checkout on translunar coast? I guess I can look that up myself. Over.
089:57:18 Roosa: Well, to answer your questions, no, there was no sounds like this. I have never heard this on any training camera. It was not on the checkout during translunar coast. It was not on this camera - I mean on this magazine during the checkout. It did not start until approximately frame 140. It stopped at frame 180, and went back to what appeared normal. And it started again on frame 240 and stayed on until the end of the pass, when I was reading frame number 420. [Long pause.]
089:57:54 Fullerton: Okay, right. We got all that copied, and we're still waiting on - on some kind of response from the experts here. So, we'll give you a call when they come back to us.
089:58:08 Roosa: Okay. I'd just like to clarify that it appears - you know that the film wound all right. The frame counter moved, and the - that both the feed, and the take-up spools were turning. And, if it's any problem, it would have been, I suspect, in the FMC. Well now, that shouldn't have been in there. It's got to be in the magazine. I don't really know. I'm going to let you all worry about that one, I guess. But, the - It appeared that the film went through all right.
089:58:37 Fullerton: Okay. We'll get back with you.
089:58:44 Roosa: Okay.
Comm break.
Flight Plan page 3-090
Apollo Control, Houston, 90 hours of Ground Elapsed Time. Pete Frank advising this flight control team. We're 20 minutes until LOS, with the rest period coming up. He wants to check around the room and see if anybody has anything that should be brought up with Shepard, or Roosa and Mitchell, prior to their eating and going to sleep. The eat period will be scheduled during their pass over the far side of the Moon. 90 hours 01 minute continuing to monitor. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
090:01:29 Roosa: And, Houston; 14. I've got some onboard readouts. [Long pause.]
090:01:50 Fullerton: Okay, 14. Sorry. I was tied up there. Go ahead with your readouts.
090:01:56 Roosa: Okay. Bat C, 37.0; Pyro A, 37.2; Pyro B, 37.2. RCS: Able, 80; Baker, 82; Charlie, 80; Dog, 83. [Long pause.]
090:02:19 Fullerton: Okay, Stu. Cau - got all those, and get a suggested checkout procedures for the LTC. Hear? [Long pause.]
090:02:36 Roosa: Okay. Go ahead.
090:02:38 Fullerton: Okay. Talked to Dale Denais. He thinks its most likely something wrong in the magazine there. And, it could either be a gear train or a clutch in there that could be making and breaking. He suggests that you get out a magazine Victor once again and put it on there and leave it in Standby awhile to verify that it doesn't cycle - or - or the FMC doesn't sweep. And, if that looks okay, then go ahead and run off two or three frames and see if it appears normal. [Long pause.]
090:03:26 Roosa: Okay. I need to put that one on anyway. I'll put on magazine V, and I'll turn the power on and put it in Standby and see how it acts, and then run off two or three frames. And, along that line, this magazine, you know, was in Standby for a minute there - you know with the power on prior to start, and we got no noises. And I agree with diagnosis there. It - I'm sure it's in the magazine, or relatively sure. It sounded like it; felt like it. And, it did feel like something like a clutch slipping on the thing. [Long pause.]
090:04:06 Fullerton: Okay. I hope we got the pictures anyway. And, let us know how the other one works.
090:04:14 Roosa: Okay. I'll smoke on through that and give you a call.
Long comm break.
Apollo Control. 90 hours, 10 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Two members of the Apollo 15 crew in Mission Control now, looking over Pete Franks shoulder. That's Dave Scott, the Commander for Apollo 15 and Al Worden who will be quite busy with photography himself as Command Module Pilot for that mission.
090:12:52 Fullerton: Apollo 14, Houston. Would you give us a - an E-MOD before LOS here? You have about 7 and a half minutes to go.
090:13:04 Mitchell: Okay. You want it right now?
090:13:05 Roosa: Okay. I'll ...
090:13:06 Fullerton: Affirmative. We're ready.
090:13:07 Roosa: ... give it to you now, Gordon.
090:13:09 Fullerton: Okay, Stu ...
090:13:10 Roosa: Okay. Coming down. [Long pause.]
090:14:01 Roosa: 14, Houston.
090:14:07 Fullerton: Go ahead. [Long pause.]
090:14:22 Fullerton: Apollo 14, Houston. Go ahead.
Very long comm break.
Apollo Control, Houston. 90 hours, 22 minutes we've had loss of signal with Apollo 14. The spacecraft now passing above the backside of the Moon. Our display presently shows an orbit of 59 nautical miles [109 km] apolune 9 nautical miles [17 km] perilune. 90 hours, 23 minutes. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
090:22:29 Roosa (onboard): I don't - No, I'm not in down here.
090:22:32 Shepard (onboard): You're not?
090:22:33 Roosa (onboard): No, I'm not on the front. Maybe it was just the camera coming up, because it was riding up. Maybe I just needed to push down on it. That feels good. Oh, hell. Just a second, Al, I've got to raise the damn thing back up again to get -
090:23:11 Roosa (onboard): No, it's cracked up here.
090:23:15 Shepard (onboard): Maybe this is your problem.
090:23:17 Roosa (onboard): Yes, it feels like maybe that. Okay. Let's bring her down now.
090:23:32 Shepard (onboard): Well I'll be durned.
090:23:34 Roosa (onboard): No, it's not -
090:23:42 Shepard (onboard): There it is.
090:23:43 Roosa (onboard): Now, there it is.
090:23:44 Shepard (onboard): Good?
090:23:45 Roosa (onboard): I'm good, if you are.
090:23:48 Shepard (onboard): Good.
090:24:00 Roosa (onboard): Okay.
090:24:19 Shepard (onboard): What do you suppose happened there?
090:24:20 Roosa (onboard): I think maybe that 65 frames a second is overtaxing the magazine or something. I think it's working. The magazine's taking up.
090:24:38 Shepard (onboard): It started making that funny noise in here after it - The vibration [Garble.]
090:24:43 Roosa (onboard): On - on the camera, during the - during the run. Now, on this last run, it did it when I went to the single frame, but I had just finished up three or four frames at 65.
090:24:53 Shepard (onboard): Yes. Well, let's see. That's where you had it [Garble.]
090:25:05 Roosa (onboard): [Garble] need some water [Garble] Somebody want a drink?
090:25:10 Mitchell (onboard): Yes. Okay. No. I'm going to try to use the bags. Sure you - That is the major item on my list.
090:25:26 Shepard (onboard): You about ready to go to sleep?
090:25:27 Mitchell (onboard): Me?
090:25:28 Roosa (onboard): I am. I am flat ready.
090:25:35 Shepard (onboard): Okay, the canister comes out of where?
090:25:41 Mitchell (onboard): The LiOH canister comes out of where?
090:25:52 Roosa (onboard): Nine into A, stow 7 and B-6.
090:26:32 Roosa (onboard): [Garble] Okay. 123 286 [Garble.]
090:27:00 Shepard (onboard): [Garble] in B-6. 9 into A.
090:27:23 Shepard (onboard): Okay, it's done.
090:27:26 Roosa (onboard): Okay, I'm marking it off.
090:28:11 Roosa (onboard): [Garble] did you verify your tape motion, Ed?
090:28:20 Roosa (onboard): Okay.
090:29:01 Roosa (onboard): Ha, ha, ha. [Garble] work on the DSKY now.
090:29:19 Unknown crew member (onboard): (Grunt)
090:29:30 Roosa (onboard): (Sigh) [Garble.]
090:29:33 Shepard (onboard): [Garble.]
090:30:04 Roosa (onboard): Oh, crap. That's not fair. We're getting here. Went and called up a Verb - or Noun 20, and now I've got to get rid of the son of a bitch.
090:30:34 Roosa (onboard): Thought I'd do a Verb 37 00. It's going to kill that Verb 79 wide deadband I've got going.
090:30:49 Roosa (onboard): Now how in the hell am I going to do that?
090:31:04 Shepard (onboard): What do you got going? Do you have a 79 going?
090:31:12 Roosa (onboard): Yes, and - without thinking I called up a Noun 20.
090:31:20 Shepard (onboard): Yes.
090:31:22 Roosa (onboard): Now I've got a Noun 20 on the son of a bitch.
090:31:31 Shepard (onboard): Well, you want - you want to leave that on there [Garble.]
090:31:39 Roosa (onboard): No.
090:31:50 Shepard (onboard): How about a - 16 65. You're still using the same - [Garble] count [Garble.]
090:32:12 Roosa (onboard): Pitch is actually far enough off, but I'm afraid - Got - got about 20 off there in that piddling around (sigh). They wanted 286. Wanted a 10-degree deadband. T think I'm going to have to go back to that attitude. Verb 49 Enter. Yes, I'm going to have to go back to that attitude [Garble.]
090:34:04 Shepard (onboard): How about a - How about a Verb 06? Is that [Garble.]
090:34:11 Roosa (onboard): Well, I just don't think they want - any - Anything on the DSKY is going - going to take - have to exercise the read counters.
090:35:00 Shepard (onboard): Get these jets off - off [Garble] that change-of-pace plane.
090:35:17 Roosa (onboard): Yes. It will kill the - it will kill the Verb 79.
090:35:25 Shepard (onboard): Well, yes, but we'll need jets [Garble.]
090:35:28 Roosa (onboard): Well, see, we used a Verb - we're using the Verb 79 here to get a 10-degree deadband for the sleep period.
090:35:34 Shepard (onboard): Yes.
090:35:36 Roosa (onboard): So I don't want to go back to the -
090:35:38 Shepard (onboard): You mean you get [Garble] gives you. a new [Garble] is that right ?
090:35:48 Shepard (onboard): See what I mean?
090:35:50 Roosa (onboard): Uh-huh, and we're there to 75, 80, 85, Okay. Let's - Enter on that. We've got a blank DSKY, and we're there.
090:36:27 Shepard (onboard): You have blank - blank DSKY now?
090:36:29 Roosa (onboard): I have a blank DSKY; it's going to fire when it hits the edge of this 10-degree deadband, and then we should be good.
090:36:45 Shepard (onboard): [Garble.]
090:38:12 Shepard (onboard): Oh, yes. You all through?
090:39:04 Roosa (onboard): I guess I'd call them - what? You got a minus 35, 272, and then REACQ, huh? Okay, 80 out of 90.
Stu is commenting on the pitch angle of minus 25 and yaw angle of 272 that are specified for the High Gain Antenna in their Flight Plan.
090:40:05 Shepard (onboard): Want to use the Myrtle, Stu?
090:40:08 Roosa (onboard): Yes. I expect - might as well.
090:40:20 Roosa (onboard): Rate Command, Rate Command, Rate Command.
Stu is flipping the Manual Attitude switches on his Main Display Console to Rate Command position.
090:41:03 Note: BEGIN LUNAR REV .
090:41:09 Shepard (onboard): [Garble.]
090:41:35 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. Got some yellow pills for the crew [Garble.] pantry, you suppose? Excuse me, Stu?
090:41:51 Roosa (onboard): Oh, I'm sorry.
090:42:25 Shepard (onboard): Where are the yellow pills?
090:43:01 Shepard (onboard): There are the yellow pills.
These yellow pills are germicidal tablets that are added into the food packets after eating to prevent bacterial growth in any food residue.
090:43:55 Shepard (onboard): Okay, you want to talk over about tomorrow?
090:44:09 Shepard (onboard): Or do you want to get up a little bit early?
090:44:16 Mitchell (onboard): Huh?
090:45:28 Roosa (onboard): Okay. From the time they have us getting up - They're going to wake us up at 99:30. Then - They're going to wake us up at 99:30; we've got an hour and a half listed for an eat period; then, they've got you putting on your suits. Are you all squared away on what you're going to take over?
090:45:34 Shepard (onboard): I think, if we just give ourselves a little extra time, we'll be all right.
090:45:37 Roosa (onboard): Yes. In fact, I've - Looking over this, I really don't see where we're going to be hurting.
090:45:41 Shepard (onboard): Well, we still [Garble] one guy, the other guy [Garble.]
090:45:59 Roosa (onboard): You all don't wear helmets and gloves. You just take them with you?
090:46:03 Shepard (onboard): That's right. That's right.
090:46:10 Roosa (onboard): Yes. It won't take us long to get the tunnel clear.
090:49:43 Shepard (onboard): That's wild, isn't it?
090:49:53 Roosa (onboard): Sure is.
090:50:17 Shepard (onboard): Well, okay. Is that everything in the Flight Plan?
090:50:26 Roosa (onboard): Everything except chlorinate the water, as far as I can tell. Did you do the presleep checklist, Ed? You finished up the presleep checklist, comm and everything, didn't you?
090:50:43 Shepard (onboard): [Garble.]
090:50:50 Roosa (onboard): Oh, really?
090:50:53 Shepard (onboard): [Garble] really.
090:51:20 Shepard (onboard): Couldn't be much of [Garble] now. Couldn't be much of [Garble] now.
090:51:28 Mitchell (onboard): Yes.
090:51:30 Roosa (onboard): What?
090:51:32 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
090:51:35 Shepard (onboard): [Garble] should be minus 35. P72, right there.
090:52:03 Shepard (onboard): Okay, Ed. Lunar orbit of sleep. That's lunar orbit of sleep.
090:52:13 Mitchell (onboard): Might be a problem.
090:52:56 Shepard (onboard): Okay. Why don't we just get up a half an hour early. Stu? [Garble] schedule that at 99:30. If that's for sure, why don't we get up at 99?
090:53:12 Roosa (onboard): What time is that on the watch?
090:53:15 Shepard (onboard): Eight hours to the minute.
090:53:17 Roosa (onboard): Eight hours. That'll be 17:30.
090:53:31 Shepard (onboard): That sound reasonable?
090:53:44 Roosa (onboard): [Garble.]
090:53:47 Shepard (onboard): Huh? Oh, that's good. [Garble] sounds all right.
090:53:58 Shepard (onboard): That way we'll be sure.
090:55:09 Unknown crew member (onboard): (Cough)
090:55:42 Roosa (onboard): Oh, did it ever!
090:57:01 Roosa (onboard): All right [Garble] Where am I? Oh, there I am.
090:58:52 Roosa (onboard): If I can get out of your way here. I keep [Garble] my feet tripped over.
Flight Plan page 3-091
Apollo Control Houston, 91 hours 02 minutes GET time for the flight of Apollo 14. We show we're 10 seconds away from time of acquisition of the spacecraft. We'll stand by.
We are now receiving data.
091:03:02 Fullerton: Apollo 14, Houston. Over.
091:03:08 Roosa: Go ahead, Houston; 14.
091:03:10 Fullerton: Okay, Stu, you're loud and clear. That early AOS on the last Rev was our mistake. We were misled by a misset clock here in the control room. How did the LTC look to you after you tried the new magazine?
091:03:30 Roosa: Well, I tell you what; we ended up with the same trouble; let me - let me run through and tell you you what it is. Let me get the Flight Plan out here.
091:03:39 Fullerton: Okay.
091:03:44 Roosa: Okay, I put Mag B on the camera, and I ran it in Standby for about 2 and a half minutes, and everything worked fine. I then went - shot three frames at about - with the intervalometer set on 10, and it worked fine. And then, I thought, well, maybe it's the fast-frame rate; so, I put it on 65 and shot off five or six, and it worked okay. Then, I went to Standby and then on to Single-Frame and punched the single frame and got the same noise. And then, it started - the magazine started actuating in - in Standby with the power on. So, I turned the power off, ran the intervalometer back down to 10, turned the power back on; still had the noise. And the magazine appears to follow the intervalometer setting, but it may do this on a random fashion while in Standby. And it does move the film, or at least the - both sP00ls move and the counter moves. And it had that same clacking sound - not really a clacking sound, but I guess it's kind of hard to describe; maybe that's as good a term as any. And so, I turned the magazine off. By this time, I had shot 20 - 20 frames - 23 frames and decided that was enough film to waste. I really didn't mean to use that many, but I was trying to check out that 65-per-minute intervalometer setting. [Long pause.]
091:05:36 Fullerton: Okay, Stu, that's a good summary of what you did. Personally, I more mystified than before. And we'll let them work on that some more.
091:05:49 Roosa: Okay, I guess, in summary, we got the same problem with both magazines. Now - maybe the film is working all right; maybe we are just getting - getting a strange noise in there on the gears or the clutch as you suggested. But we've ended up now with both magazines having the same symptom.
091:06:13 Fullerton: Roger, understand. We'll think about it while you are sleeping, I guess, and maybe have some fresh ideas in the morning. For your general information, the - Your pericynthion was slightly high, but it seems to be coming down faster than we anticipated it would with each Rev; with the result that at PDI time, you ought to be right on the money, as near as we can tell. So it's pretty good work on that point. [Long pause.]
091:06:54 Roosa: Okay, that sounds real good; I guess I - I was a little surprised at the 0.6 residual from the G&N. You know, the impulse burn was a little lower than that, but I guess somebody - it doesn't bother anybody. And, yes, it looked like a real great burn to us, and it sounds like good news about being right there for PDI.
091:07:19 Fullerton: Okay, and one thing for Ed: his biosensor seems to be acting up. We'd like him at his convenience, some time before suiting up tomorrow, to go through the same sort of checkout that Al did earlier in the flight on his sensors. Over. [Long pause.]
091:07:42 Roosa: Okay, I'll pass that on to Ed.
091:07:47 Fullerton: Okay, that's all I have on my list at the moment. Over.
091:07:57 Roosa: Okay, I guess we've got nothing else here. We're going to try to get secured for the big day tomorrow, and we'll be seeing you in the morning.
091:08:07 Fullerton: Okay, I'll make one check to make sure we haven't got anything else before we shut up and let you get some sleep.
091:08:17 Roosa: Okay. [Long pause.]
091:08:33 Fullerton: Okay, Stu. One - one other thing. We did get that E - E - E-MOD before we went AOS, okay; and, I guess - Wait I just think there - there is one thing. Just stand by. [Long pause.]
091:08:52 Fullerton: Okay, we would like you to turn the optics off tonight. That should do it. Get a good rest there. Over.
091:09:02 Roosa: Roger; we'll get the optics off before we go to sleep, and we've been doing that. And yes, I guess, if you've got any other questions on that - on the Hycon, I'd entertain them now to help you with the troubleshooting, but that's about it. We'll see you tomorrow.
091:09:21 Fullerton: Okay, good night.
Very long comm break.
Apollo Control Houston. 91 hours 09 minutes into the flight of Apollo 14. That was Stu Roosa signing off for the evening, on behalf of the crew of Apollo 14. We presently show 14 in an orbit around the Moon of 59.2 nautical miles [109.6 km] apolune, perilune 9 nautical miles [17 km]. We are at 91 hours 10 minutes, we do not expect to contact the crew any further during this front side pass, but we'll stand by an continue to monitor in the event that we do. This is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control Houston, at 91 hours 39 minutes and now reading in GET. We're less than 30 minutes away now from LOS with the Apollo 14 spacecraft. The crew of Apollo 14, Al Shepard, Ed Mitchell Stu Roosa now in a rest period, We do not expect to hear from them for the balance of our front side pass. We presently show 14 in an orbit of 59.2 nautical miles [109.6 km] by 9 nautical miles [17 km], and we have an announcement to make: Mr. Camillio Ripamonti, the Italian Minister for Science and Technology, will hold a news conference at 2 p.m. this afternoon in the News Center Briefing Room. That's at 2 p.m. this afternoon at the News Center Briefing Room. We're at 91 hours 40 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control Houston 51 hours - or 91 hours 51 minutes GET, we presently show Apollo 14 in an orbit of 59 nautical miles [109 km] by 8.9 nautical miles [16.5 km]. The surgeon advises that they're monitoring Command Module Pilot Stu Roosa at this time. Their indications are that Roosa's probably still awake, certainly relaxing. We show Apollo 14 traveling at a speed of 5505 feet per second [1,678 m/s]. It's present altitude above the Moon 18.2 nautical miles [33.7 km]. This is Apollo Control Houston.
Apollo Control Houston. We're coming up now on the LOS with the spacecraft on this the fifth revolution. Network reports we've just had loss of signal, we'll take down the line at this time. We're at 92 hours 8 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control Houston. Control Houston.
092:06:47 Mitchell (onboard): You want the towel, don't you?
092:06:56 Roosa (onboard): What the hell. I thought I had a used towel over there.
092:07:00 Shepard (onboard): [Garble] anyway.
092:07:06 Roosa (onboard): Here, here's a towel.
092:07:31 Shepard (onboard): Okay. [Garble.]
092:07:57 Roosa (onboard): Well, you're supposed to do like I'm thinking, not what I say.
092:08:39 Mitchell (onboard): And let me have the water gun. The top is on it.
092:10:07 Roosa (onboard): Yes, that ought to do it.

092:10:13 Roosa (onboard): What?
092:10:14 Mitchell (onboard): [Garble.]
092:10:16 Roosa (onboard): No, put the - put the casing back on it, and use it to twist it off.
092:11:14 Roosa (onboard): What? You shouldn't - as long as you don't have anything in that casing; you're not pushing in on the needle.
092:14:56 Roosa (onboard): Hey, I think the more - I think from here on out, I'll chlorinate the water (laughter).
092:15:00 Unknown crew member (onboard): [Garble.]
092:15:03 Roosa (onboard): Okay, thank you. Appreciate that (laughter).
092:15:36 Roosa (onboard): It's amazing how fast you can change your orientation.
092:15:37 Unknown crew member (onboard): Yes. [Garble.]
092:15:51 Roosa (onboard): Man, I looked out here a little bit ago - two Revs ago as we were coming out of the darkness - farside terminator, looking down there - and I - and I didn't know how I was oriented or how - which way the terminator was even running, and it looked just exactly like you were falling straight down - into the surface.
092:16:49 Roosa (onboard): Yes, I'm ready.
092:16:50 Unknown crew member (onboard): Huh?
092:16:51 Roosa (onboard): I'm ready.
092:19:53 Roosa (onboard): I just saw a flash - with my eyes wide open.

This is Apollo Control Houston at 92 hours, 55 minutes GET time. We're less than a minute away now from reacquiring the space craft as it will be passing over the front side of the Moon on its 6th revolution. The crew of Apollo 14 presently enjoying a rest period. We have no plans to contact the spacecraft, however, we will keep the line open in the eventuality that we receive a call from one of the crew, members of the crew. Less than 15 seconds away from projected time of acquisition. We'll stand by an continue to monitor. Network advises that we have acquired data. Apollo 14 now passing over the front side of the Moon. And in the mission control center, Flight Director Milt Windier now on station along with members of his Maroon team of flight controllers. 92 hours 57 minutes into the flight this is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 93 hours, 22 minutes. We have a little over 6 hours remaining in the current crew rest period. At the present time Apollo 14 is at an altitude of about 11 nautical miles above the lunar surface moving down towards pericynthion of 8.8 nautical miles. The current apocynthion that we're reading is 59.4 nautical miles. There will be a change of shift press briefing shortly in the MSC news center briefing room. The participants in the briefing will be Flight Director, Pete Frank, and CapCom, Gordon Fullerton. Flight Director Milton Windler has completed recently and are going around the room checking the status of the mission and the spacecraft with each of his flight controllers. The reports are coming back in ail cases that the mission is proceeding smoothly and no problems with the spacecraft or the mission at this point. At 93 hours, 23 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston, standing by.
This is Apollo Control at 93 hours, 49 minutes. We have about five hours 40 minutes left in this crew rest period. Stu Roosa has the watch in the spacecraft, and is the only crewman on whom we have a biomedical data, and that is in and out as we get high bit rate. But the surgeon reports that at the last look it appears that Stu Roosa was sleeping. Well, we have about 12 minutes remaining before we lose contact again with the spacecraft as it goes behind the Moon on the sixth revolution. And our data on the Command Module at the present time shows the cabin temperature holding right around 70 degrees, cabin pressure of about 5.2 pounds per square inch, which is normal in both respects. At 93 hours 50 minutes, this is Apollo Control standing by.
This is Apollo Control at 94 hours, 1 minute. We are about to lose acquisition with the spacecraft now, and Flight Director Milton Windler has just gone around the room to get a final status check before loss of signal, and every thing looks good at this time. The crew has about 5 and a half hours remaining in their rest period, and when next we acquire Apollo 14, it will be on their 7th revolution of the Moon. And our communications officer reports we have loss of signal now and will be reacquiring the space craft in about 45 minutes. At 94 hours 02 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston.
094:28:03 Note: BEGIN LUNAR Rev-7.

This is Apollo Control at 94 hours, 51 minutes. We're standing by now to reacquire Apollo 14 on its seventh revolution of the Moon. Network reports that we have - just had acquisition. The crew has about four and a half hours remaining in their rest period and we do not expect any conversation with the spacecraft during this front side pass on the Moon. However, we will keep the circuits up live in the event that we get any conversation with the spacecraft. We're presently showing Apollo 14 at an altitude of 40.7 nautical miles above the Moon, and we're reading an apocynphion of 59.3 nautical miles and a pericynthion or a low point of 8.8. There's been virtually no conversation on the loops here in Mission Control. Shortly after the spacecraft passed behind the Moon on the last revolution, Flight Director Milton Windler advised his flight controllers that he would like to review procedures for the ascent which this ship will have - the lift off from the Moon during the next backside pass. When the spacecraft is out of communications with Earth. At 94 hours, 52 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston standing by.
This is Apollo Control at 95 hours, 47 minutes. We now have 3 hours 43 minutes remaining in the crew rest period, and it continues to be very quiet here in mission control. We'll lose contact with the spacecraft in about 9 minutes on this the 7th revolution. The Italian minister for science and technology, Camillio Ripamonti, will meet with news men in the MSC news center briefing room at this time. At 95 hours, 47 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston, standing by.
This is Apollo Control at 95 hours, 56 minutes. We are coming up now on LOS from the spacecraft as it passes behind the Moon. And when next we acquire the vehicle will be on its 8th revolution. The crew now about 3 and a half hours from the end of their rest period and it continues rather quiet in mission control. Network advises us that we have LOS now, and during this back side pass while we are out of communication with the spacecraft, the maroon team of flight controllers will review procedures that will be using in the lunar lift off, at about 142 hours, 24 minutes GET time. At 95 hours 56 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
096:23:03 Note: BEGIN LUNAR Rev-8.
Flight Plan page 3-094
This is Apollo Control at 96 hours 34 minutes and we're just about to acquire Apollo 14 at the eighth revolution of the Moon. Now coming out on the topside. The crew is still in the midst of a rest period and we have about 2 hours 45 minutes remaining in that rest period. Stu Roosa the Command Module Pilot has the watch on this sleep shift wearing a headset, and should it be necessary for any reason to awaken the crew, the call would go to Roosa. This is done at this time to provide the maximum opportunity of sleep to the Lunar Module Pilot and the commander, Ed Mitchell and Al Shepard. Of course we'll be having an extremely long day with powerered descent tomorrow morning. At the present time we're showing Apollo 14 at an altitude of 40.7 nautical miles, moving down toward pericynthion, and the pericynthion reading at this Time is 8.7 nautical miles, continuing to come down slowly as the FIDO expected it would. And the apocynthion, the high point of the orbit at 59.6 nautical miles. Although we don't expect any calls from the crew, we will standby with the lines up in the event that we should get a call. At 96 hours, 45 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston standing by.
This is Apollo Control at 97 hours, 27 minutes. We're now a little over 2 hours away from the scheduled end of this rest period. The crew is scheduled to awake at about this time on the next revolution, the 9th revolution of the Moon. During the sleep period, which has been relatively quiet in Mission Control, flight controllers have used the time to advantage to review Flight Plans, checklists and procedures for the coming days where a lot of busy activities are scheduled, in particular for this shift the procedures which will be used by each of the controllers and on each of the consoles for the powered ascent, the lift off from the Moon. At the present time we show Apollo 14 at an altitude of 12.7 nautical miles. The spacecraft velocity at this time is 5,535 feet per second, and as the spacecraft continues to climb toward apogee, which is now 59.5 nautical miles, that velocity will continue to drop off slowly, and then peak back up again to somewhat more than 55,000 feet per second as it drops on in toward pericynthion again. At 97 hours, 29 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston continuing to stand by.
This is Apollo Control at 97 hours, 49 minutes. And we're less than 45 seconds now from scheduled loss of signal with the spacecraft as it goes around the corner of the Moon on this the eighth revolution. We'll be reacquiring again roughly 45 minutes after loss of signal. On the next revolution the sleep period is scheduled to end. We're now showing 1 hour, 40 minutes until the scheduled crew awakening time. And at the present time we show Apollo 14 with a pericynthion of 8.5 nautical miles. And our communications engineer reports we've had loss of contact now with the Command Module. At 97 hours, 50 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
