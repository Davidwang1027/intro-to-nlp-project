These are quiet times for the mission of Apollo 14. With Isaac Newton driving, as Bill Anders put it during Apollo 8, the crew is along for the ride.
Editor's note: All transcript times are presented according to the GET update at 054:53:36 that saw the mission timer moved forward 40 minutes, 2.90 seconds.
This is Apollo Control 178 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The crew apparently asleep at this time. The spacecraft distance from the Earth 149,950 nautical miles, velocity 4,138 feet per second. Spacecraft weight 24,559 pounds. First indication here on the present trajectory for a time of entry interface are 400,000 feet. This time will fluctuate in the next two days as we get nearer to entry but the initial time shown here in the space digitals computation display shows that time to be 216 hours 27 minutes 31 seconds. Entry velocity 36,170 feet per second, at an entry angle of minus 6.63 degrees. But as mentioned before these numbers will all shift back and forth especially after any further midcourse corrections. Rather quiet here in the control room. Members of Pete Frank's Orange Team of flight controllers are beginning to drift in, takeover console for a shift handover less than an hour from now. And at 178 hours 13 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 179 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The crew of Apollo 14 are presently in a rest period. Meanwhile, in Mission Control we've had a hand over of flight control teams. The Orange Team headed by Flight Director Pete Frank now on board. Our Capsule Communicator for this shift is Apollo 13 astronaut Fred Haise. Realistically, we do not expect Haise to have verbal contact with the crew, but he will be in a stand by mode throughout the morning. And, momentarily Flight Director Pete Frank will be going around the room posting each of his consoles as to our status. And at 179 hours 13 minutes,this is Apollo Control Houston.
Apollo Control, Houston. Ground elapsed time 179 hours 14 minutes. Apollo 14 is presently 147,447 nautical miles away from Earth, and traveling at a velocity of 4,197 feet per second. This is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 180 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Our displays in Mission Control presently show Apollo 14 at a distance of 145,076 nautical miles away from the Earth and traveling at a velocity of 4 253 feet per second. Meanwhile in the Mission Control Center, relative quiet, it could be described as a quiet business-like atmosphere, very little conversation going on over the Flight Director's loop. However, over the past hour Flight Director Pete Frank has been talking to his recovery support room, receiving an update on our end of mission status. The prime recovery vessel, the New Orleans, is presently at a position of 22 degrees 40 minutes south, 171 degrees 20 minutes west. This places the vessel approximately 5 degrees north, at the present time, of the prime landing area. The present end of mission coordinates that we're reading out are 27 degrees 2 minutes south, 172 degrees 37 minutes west. The end of mission weather forecast at this time appears quite favorable, showing a cloud coverage of 2 000 feet scattered, broken. Visibility 10 miles, winds 12 knots from 100 degrees, wave heights 4 feet. We're at l80 hours 14 minutes, continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 181 hours and 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We presently show Apollo 14 at a distance of 142,587 nautical miles away from the Earth. And traveling at a speed of 4,314 feet per second. The crew of Apollo 14 continues in their rest - in it's rest period. We've had no contact with the crew during the past hour. Our capsule communicator, Fred Haise, has been engaged in quiet discussions with Flight Director, Pete Frank, on various aspects of the mission, the more active parts of the mission. Meanwhile, we do show that we will reach that point in time where the velocities relative to the Earth and Moon will match. This should occur at Ground Elapsed Time of 182 hours 3 minutes. And that matching velocity should read 4370 feet per second. We're at 181 hours 13 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control Houston.
At 182 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We now show Apollo 14 at a distance of 140,059 nautical miles away from the Earth travelling at a velocity of 4,377 feet per second. Meanwhile, in the Mission Control Center our wakeup clock has started to countdown. We show 3 hours 47 minutes from time of waking up the crew of Apollo 14. Other activity is quite subdued. Members of our flight control team are presently watching a replay of last night's television transmission now being displayed on one of the large screens in the Mission Control Center. We're at 182 hours 13 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 183 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 14 now at a distance of 137,506 nautical miles away from Earth, traveling at a velocity of now of 442 feet per second. Apollo 14 passed its' half way point in time 2 minutes ago. This being the time from Trans-Earth Injection burn shutdown to entry. Our clock at this reference point showed Apollo 14 at a Ground Elapsed Time of 133 hours 10 minutes, a distance away from Earth at 137 591 nautical miles, and a velocity relative to Earth 4440 feet per second. Our wakeup clock in Mission Control shows that we have 2 hours 46 minutes before the crew of Apollo 14, Al Shepard, Stu Roosa, and Ed Mitchell are awakened. At 183 hours 14 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 183 hours 23 minutes now Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 14 presently 137,033 nautical miles away from Earth. And traveling at a speed of 4,454 feet per second. We have a correction to make to our previous announcement that halfway point in time at time from TEI shutdown to entry was reached at 183 hours 10 minutes Ground Elapsed Time rather than 133 hours 10 minutes as previously reported. We're at 183 hours 24 minutes and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 184 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 14 is now 134,907 nautical miles away from Earth, velocity now reading 4,510 feet per second. The crew continuing in their rest period. Our clock at Mission Control showing now 1 hour 47 minutes until time of wakeup. At present the requirement for a midcourse correction six appears to be not a strong one, and the possibility of this maneuver at this time appears unlikely. We would presently show midcourse correction six is performed at a ground elapse time of a 194 hours 23 minutes, and with a Delta-V of .9 feet per second. We're at 184 hours 13 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, and this is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 185 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Our digital displays presently show Apollo 14 at a distance of 132,261 nautical miles away from the Earth. And they're traveling at a speed of 4580 feet per second. It's 47 minutes until the scheduled time for crew wake up. Apollo 13 astronaut Fred Haise is our Capsule Communicator. We presently show the spacecraft weight of 24,559 pounds, all systems aboard Apollo 14 have been performing as advertised. All aspects of the return flight thus far look very good. We're at 185 hours 13 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control Houston. 185 hours 59 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We presently show Apollo 14 at a distance of 130,166 nautical miles away from Earth, traveling at a speed of 4,637 feet per second. In the mission control center CapCom Fred Haise should be placing a wake-up call to the Apollo 14 crew shortly. We'll keep our line open and continue to await that call. At 185 hours 59 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston, standing by.
Apollo Control Houston. 186 hours, 3 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 14 now 129,959 nautical miles out from Earth. The present velocity shows 46411 feet per second. Standing by this is Apollo Control, Houston.
186:03:00 Haise: Hello, 14; Houston.
Comm break.
186:06:12 Haise: Good morning, Apollo 14; Houston.
That's Fred Haise placing that call.
186:06:35 Mitchell: Houston, Apollo 14. Good morning, Freddo.
And Ed Mitchell responding.
186:06:40 Haise: Good morning, Edgar. It's pretty chilly down here. How's it up there?
186:06:52 Mitchell: Oh, very comfortable; 71 degrees in the cabin. What do you mean by chilly? Is it freezing?
186:07:00 Haise: Well, let's see; this little report I've got here says it's supposed to get down to around 28 degrees.
This equals to - 2.2 degrees Celsius, well below freezing.
186:07:12 Mitchell: Man, have you moved Houston to the North Pole already?
186:07:17 Haise: Yes. There's also a pretty good breeze blowing which doesn't help.
186:07:25 Mitchell: Got the old chill factor down a little bit, huh?
186:07:28 Haise: Yes.
186:07:32 Mitchell: Well, hold on a minute. Let's see if I can wake the rest of these guys up.
186:07:36 Haise: Okay.
186:08:19 Mitchell: Now there's some grumbling going over - on over here about getting up, Fred, but I think they'll be around in a minute.
186:08:25 Haise: Okay. I had suggested that maybe we let you keep your banker's hours, but Flight brought up the point that tomorrow morning you can't afford to sleep in late, so - if you're going to get the job done and get back in - so, we'll try to get you back on the schedule today.
186:08:45 Mitchell: Okay. Fair enough.
186:08:58 Mitchell: And I'll get some of these chores done; I'll be back with you in a few minutes, Freddo.
186:09:03 Haise: Okay, Ed.
Long comm break.
We're standing by for further communications with the crew of Apollo 14. Ed Mitchell responded apparently Al Shepard, Stu Roosa still asleep but they should be awake very shortly. We're at 186 hours, 10 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and Apollo 14 at a distance of 129,669 nautical miles away from the Earth, velocity 4,651 feet per second. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
Distance to go is 240,147 km, and their velocity is up to 1,418 m/s.
186:19:31 Haise: 14, Houston.
186:19:36 Mitchell: Go ahead.
186:19:38 Haise: Ed, I wonder if we can get you to put O2 tank 3 Heater to Auto; tanks 1 and 2 to Off.
186:19:55 Mitchell: Okay. O2 tank 3 Heater, Auto; 1 and 2 to Off.
186:20:00 Haise: Roger.
186:20:31 Haise: And, 14; Houston. I've got a few items that there's no big rush on. When you get free, just give me a call.
186:20:43 Mitchell: Okay, Freddo. I'm switching to High Gain as per Flight Plan unless you say otherwise.
186:20:51 Haise: Stand by. Okay, Ed. Why don't you hold off on that a little bit? One of the - these things that we're in no big hurry on is to play with the comm a little more on the - checking Primary and Secondary, et cetera. But we'll do that in a little while.
186:21:14 Mitchell: Okay. And shall I start battery charge A now?
186:21:23 Haise: Roger. You can commence battery charge A.
Long comm break.
186:26:12 Haise: 14, Houston.
186:26:28 Mitchell: Go ahead.
186:26:34 Haise: 14, Houston. I wonder if you could verify, Ed, that the Tank 3 50-Watt Heater breaker on 226 is open.
186:26:47 Mitchell: Freddo - Freddo, you're breaking up. Wait until we get the antenna in a better position.
186:26:52 Haise: Okay.
Long comm break.
Apollo Control Houston 186 hours 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Looking at our displays, we see that Apollo 14 has started computer program number 52. This is a platform alignment. Apparently the crew already started some of the early aspects of today's Flight Plan. We're at 186 hours 29 minutes and we show Apollo 14 at a distance of 128,821 nautical miles at a velocity of 4,675 feet per second. Apollo Control Houston.
186:31:12 Haise: How do you read now, Ed?
186:31:19 Mitchell: Loud and clear, Freddo.
186:31:22 Haise: Okay. Since we had that tank 3 back in the line, we just wanted to verify that the Tank 3 50-Watt Heater breaker on 226 is still open.
186:31:44 Mitchell: That's verified; it's still open.
186:31:46 Haise: Very good.
186:31:50 Mitchell: It's still a mystery as to how it got closed yesterday.
186:31:56 Haise: You've just got nimble toes, maybe.
186:32:07 Mitchell: I guess that's quite possible.
186:33:26 Haise: And we have the Noun 93s.
Comm break.
Fred is commenting on the results of their latest P52 realignment which they can remotely observe in Mission Control.
This is Stu's 24th P52 realignment of the guidance platform during the flight. As a reference, he sighted on star 24 (Acrux) and star 42 (Peacock). As a check of his sighting accuracy, the computer compared the measured angle between these stars and the actual angle. The difference between them was 000.00 degrees, 'all balls' - a perfect result. Finally, the computer displayed Noun 93, the angles by which the gimbals would be rotated or 'torqued' to restore perfect alignment. These were +0.040° in X, -0.460° in Y and +0.076° in Z axis. According to the post-flight Mission Report, the platform was torqued at 186:34 GET.
186:37:43 Mitchell: Houston, 14.
186:37:47 Haise: Go ahead, 14.
186:37:51 Mitchell: Freddo, let me give you our postsleep report.
186:37:56 Haise: Okay.
186:37:59 Mitchell: Okay, we each had 4 hours' sleep; PRD for Al is 16059; PRD for Ed, 07057; and. Stu didn't have one; it's broken.
186:38:17 Haise: Okay. We copy.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control Houston. 186 hours 59 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We've had no conversation with the crew of Apollo 14 for awhile, very possibly the crew having their morning meal. We're now showing Apollo 14 at a distance of 127,459 nautical miles, and traveling at a speed of 4,713 feet per second. Standing by, continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control Houston.
Distance to go is 236,054 km, velocity is up to 1,437 m/s.
187:39:33 Mitchell: Houston, 14.
187:39:36 Haise: Go ahead, 14.
187:39:40 Mitchell: I've been giving you these confounded medical reports every day; how's your pulse this morning?
187:39:48 Haise: It's pretty slow about right now, Ed.
187:39:53 Mitchell: Okay. But you're alive and well and no medication, huh?
187:39:59 Haise: Yes. I'm on a different Flight Plan than you are. I'm just fixing to get to my sleep period.
187:40:07 Mitchell: I see. Okay.
Mitchell's comment. Fred Haise has served as the CapCom on the orange shift team of flight controllers. We're in the process of having a handover at Mission Control. With the maroon team headed by Flight Director Milt Windler, coming aboard. We're at 187 hours Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
Long comm break.
187:14:59 Haise: 14, Houston.
187:15:04 Mitchell: Go ahead, Freddo.
187:15:06 Haise: Okay. I wonder if you could set your two High Gain knobs to Pitch, minus 40; and Yaw, 90.
187:15:25 Mitchell: Minus 40 and 90. You have it.
187:15:27 Haise: Okay.
187:15:47 Haise: And, Ed, I wonder if we can get - get you to put the switch to Narrow and Reacq.
187:18:02 Mitchell: Narrow and Reacq. You have it.
187:16:05 Haise: Roger.
187:16:24 Haise: Okay. And Ed, we'll - we're just going to sit here a little while; and then, we'll look at it -make sure it doesn't drift off - before we proceed any further.
187:16:36 Mitchell: Okay.
Comm break.
187:20:05 Mitchell: Houston, Apollo 14.
187:20:08 Haise: Go ahead, 14.
187:20:11 Mitchell: Freddo, I'm ready to copy the consumables update.
187:20:14 Haise: Okay. It's GET of 186 hours; your RCS total, 40 - stand by 1.
187:21:03 Haise: Okay, Ed. RCS total, 46.2; quad A, 47.0; B, 43.7; C, 47.1; and Delta, 46.9; H2 tanks: 1, 38.1; 2, 36.9; 02 tank 1, 67*0; and number 2, 68.6; and number 3 is 15.2.
187:21:46 Mitchell: Okay. Readback: At GET 186:00; RCS total, 46.2; quads: 47.0, 43.7, 47.1, 46.9; hydrogen: 38.1, 36.9; oxygen: 67.0, 68.6, 15.2.
Their critical consumables are still well above the so-called red lines.
187:22:09 Haise: Okay. Good readback.
187:22:45 Haise: 14, Houston.
187:22:48 Mitchell: Go ahead, Freddo.
187:22:50 Haise: Okay, looks like that High Gain has drifted. Would you select Manual, and when it's back to your preset knob settings there, go back to Reacq for us; and then select High Gain; and we'll command it then.
187:25:10 Mitchell: Okay,
187:25:27 Mitchell: Okay. You got it.
187:25:29 Haise: Okay, Ed.
Long comm break.
187:26:31 Mitchell (onboard): Houston.
187:26:42 SC (onboard):[Garble]
187:26:49 Shepard (onboard): Okay.
187:28:40 Mitchell (onboard): . 9
187:28:42 Roosa (onboard):[Garble]
187:28:48 Mitchell (onboard): Well, don't do it now. Move on.
187:29:00 Mitchell (onboard): ... let me do it,
This is Apollo Control at 187 hours 34 minutes. Our shift change has been completed in Mission Control. Flight director on this shift is Milton Windler, and the capsule communicator is astronaut Bruce McCandless. Apollo 14 at this time is 125,865 nautical miles from Earth. The spacecraft velocity, 4,760 feet per second.
187:35:10 Mitchell (onboard): Very good .
187:38:17 Roosa: Houston, 14.
187:38:27 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. Over.
187:38:32 Roosa: Good morning, Bruce. The EMS entry check passed okay.
This is a scheduled test of the Entry Monitoring System.
187:38:36 McCandless: Oh, very good, Stu.
187:40:35 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. Over.
187:40:39 Roosa: Go ahead, Houston.
187:40:41 McCandless: If you could give us a status report on the progress of the inflight demos, especially any that you consider that you've completed, we can release some of the supporting personnel. Over.
187:40:55 Roosa: Okay. I guess we need to talk about that. We completed the heat-flow and convection experiment all the way; never did really get too many good results on our Benard cells, but we got some. We finished - essentially, we're finished with all the inflight experiments, with the exception of the metal composites, and we're pressing along through those. And I guess we - we don't require any more support.
187:41:33 McCandless: Okay. Thank you, 14.
Long comm break.
187:52:54 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
187:52:59 Roosa: Go ahead, Houston; 14.
187:53:02 McCandless: 14, our current feeling is that midcourse correction number 6 will probably not be required. However, we'll give you a definite decision on that later on, after we get a little bit more tracking. And we have a procedure for further investigation into the light-flash phenomena, which we'd like to get your feelings on. If we don't burn midcourse 6, we're looking at scheduling a period of something on the order of an hour, starting at about 193:45 or 193:50, for this light-flash investigation, and we're wondering how that fits into your onboard schedule. Over.
187:53:53 Roosa: Stand by 1.
187:54:24 Roosa: Okay, Bruce. Is - If we do skip midcourse 6, why that'll be all right. We'll - we'll take that time for the light flash.
187:54:32 McCandless: Roger, Stu. Out.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 188 hours 5 minutes. Apollo 14 at this time 124,404 nautical miles from Earth, and spacecraft velocity up to 4,800 feet per second. Primary activities for the crew today will be, a series of star sighting navigation checks that they'll be running with their onboard guidance system, using the onboard sextant to sight and mark on selective stars. This information is integrated by the computer to update the guidance system's knowledge of the spacecraft's position and velocity, and is used as a back-up to the ground computed numbers for midcourse corrections and for entry. Also today, the crew will be stowing the probe assembly which was brought back for engineering analysis. They'll begin stowing the probe at about one hundred and ninety hours and the flight activities officer estimate that this will require about an hours time. The crew is also scheduled to hold a televised press conference from the spacecraft at 195 hours 7 minutes, which is 5:30 p.m. Central Standard time. They also reported that they have virtually finished the in-flight demonstrations, I believe Stu Roosa said they had finished with all but the metal composites.
188:24:33 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
188:24:38 Roosa: Go ahead.
188:24:39 McCandless: 14, when you pass out of the region of Omni Delta coverage, we will ground-command you over to the high gain antenna. At this point, however, you will be in a region where reflections from the spacecraft make acquisition marginal. And, if we - if the antenna is not automatically acquired by the time that you get to the calibration attitude, we would like you to take over and commence a normal acquisition at the optics CAL attitude for us. Over.
188:25:17 Roosa: Okay. We'll do that.
188:25:22 McCandless: Roger. Out.
188:25:52 Roosa: Houston, 14.
188:25:55 McCandless: Go ahead, 14.
188:25:57 Roosa: Hey, Bruce. Do you want us to go Omni Delta now? You know we're on High Gain now.
188:26:04 McCandless: 14, this is Houston - -
188:26:05 Roosa: ...
188:26:06 McCandless: - - We're controlling your antenna configuration from the ground here. Just leave the configuration on board as is. Over.
188:26:14 Roosa: Okay.
188:28:46 McCandless: 14, Houston. We seem to have acquired a good signal strength. How do you read? Over.
188:28:54 Roosa: Loud and clear, Houston; 14.
188:28:56 McCandless: Roger. Out.
Comm break.
188:34:14 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston.
188:34:20 Shepard: Go ahead, Houston.
188:34:23 McCandless: 14, for Stu, we're receiving a - I guess you could call it a carrier from his biomed, but we're getting neither the EKG nor the respiration trace. And we wonder if the harness connectors to the signal conditioners are properly mated up. Over.
188:34:45 Roosa: Just stand by, Bruce. I'll check that.
188:34:50 McCandless: Roger. Out.
188:36:33 McCandless: Okay. Thank you, Stu.
188:36:41 Shepard: Houston, 14. How does the rest of the crew look on biomeds?
188:36:43 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. Al, you look 4 0 on the biomed. We're not receiving Ed's right now. It looks like he's either turned off or totally disconnected. Over.
188:37:14 Shepard: Well, he's not on the air right now, but I was wondering how he looked the last time I saw him yesterday. ...
188:37:22 McCandless: Yes. The surgeon's telling me you - -
188:37:23 Shepard: ...
188:37:25 McCandless: Surgeon's telling me you all look in great shape, and he wasn't concerned about anything.' He Just wanted to find out what the problem was there, because he was getting something that indicated the signal conditioners and - all that were hooked up - and the TM was turned on, but we weren't getting a signal through on top of the carrier there. Over.
188:37:46 Shepard: Okay. Well, Ed and I had had some ... sensor problems earlier, and I just wondered how we were looking now. Thank you.
188:37:54 McCandless: Roger. Out.
188:47:27 Shepard: Houston, 14. How's the downlink look to you now?
188:47:33 McCandless: In what respect, Al? Biomed? Over.
188:47:39 Shepard: Negative. TM.
188:47:41 McCandless: Oh, it's looking beautiful to us.
188:47:45 Shepard: Okay, we're proceeding. We didn't want you to miss the world's expert on 23 ... here.
The teasing about Stu's consistently accurate P23 observations continues over air to ground.
188:47:51 McCandless: Oh, we won't. And I - you can tell Stu I made a hard copy of his 00 Noun 49 yesterday. We'll present it to him, framed, with suitable ceremony.
188:48:03 Shepard: Very good. You missed some others while you were gone somewhere else.
188:48:08 McCandless: No, I was here when he made the second one, too, but you don't get a framed certificate for each one.
188:48:14 Shepard: Oh, okay.
188:51:38 McCandless: Okay. We copy that one, Stu.
188:51:51 McCandless: Over.
188:52:00 Roosa: Roger. Apparently you haven't really taken a look at what 49 should be after long periods of testing. I think we kind of expect that sort of thing, particularly on the first mark.
188:52:10 McCandless: Roger. Out.
Comm break.
188:53:45 McCandless: 14, Houston. The analysis of your first mark there is that that's within about one and a half sigma, and is, indeed, what we expect on the first mark after a period of time such as this. Over.
188:54:00 Shepard: Roger. Out.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 189 hours 04 minutes, Apollo 14 now 121,665 nautical miles from Earth, a spacecraft velocity 4,882 feet per second. Aboard the spacecraft at the present time Stu Roosa is in the midst of performing a series of star sightings as part of the midcourse navigation, that activity scheduled to continue for another 15 to 20 minutes. At the present time, we do not expect midcourse correction 6 to be performed. The retro fire return to Earth officer reported that he considers the chances of doing that maneuver just about zero. However, the final decision won't be made probably for another hour or two anyway, and at the present time our tracking data shows that the entry interface angle, which these midcourse corrections are primarily designed to control, is negative 6.63 degrees. Nominal is 6.5, so we are very close to the normal preferred entry interface angle and it's also normal to expect these numbers to change somewhat with additional tracking as the spacecraft moves closer to Earth. We have also seen no change in the time of entry interface, 216 hours 27 minutes 31 seconds, and that is essentially the same number we have been reading since yesterday after midcourse correction 5 was performed. Splashdown occurs approximately 14 minutes after entry interface or about 216 hours 41 minutes.
Distance to go is 225,324 km, and their velocity is up to 1,437 m/s.
189:27:40 McCandless: 14, this is Houston.
189:27:44 Roosa: Go ahead.
189:27:46 McCandless: Roger. On our telemetry, it looks like you accepted an update this last time on star 4; and our recommendation is that the updates from the first three stars be used for navigation updating, and the last ones - 4, 5, and 6 - just for your own benefit in testing out the P23 techniques, but not for updating the state vector. Over.
189:28:12 Roosa: Okay. Sorry about that, Bruce.
189:28:15 McCandless: Also, 14; we've noticed the cabin pressure go up slightly here, over some period of time, and we're wondering if you changed the cabin configuration any. You're up to about 5-7 on our telemetry. Over.
189:28:44 Shepard: Houston, we've been testing out a couple of the oxygen masks for a while this morning. That may have done it. We'll keep an eye on it.
189:28:54 McCandless: Roger. It's certainly no problem; you just had the EECOMs a little confused here.
The crew oxygen masks are connected to the repress package.
189:23:02 Shepard: Well, perhaps the problem was here.
This is Apollo Control at 189 hours 43 minutes. The crew has completed the midcourse navigation down in program 23 at this time and they'll be setting the spacecraft up in the passive thermal control mode, rotating the spacecraft slowly about its longitudinal axis at the rate of about three revolutions per hour, to maintain the proper thermal control, in drifting flight. At this time we show Apollo 14 119,775 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity moving up now closer to the 5,000 foot per second mark, now reading 4,940 feet per second.
190:00:46 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. We show that you're damped out sufficiently to start the spinup at this time. Over.
190:01:00 Mitchell: Okay, Houston. We will do that very thing. Thank you.
190:01:18 Shepard: Houston, 14.
190:01:20 McCandless: Go ahead.
190:01:25 Shepard: Got a little something for you. (Camelot from "Camelot" plays, performed by Richard Burton.)
190:01:34 Shepard: Oh, I got in on the tail end of that one.
Al's music ends just as he started teasing Bruce with it.
190:01:38 McCandless: I appreciate you thinking about me, Al.
190:05:11 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. We'd like to terminate battery Alpha charging at this time. Over.
190:05:20 Shepard: Okay.
190:09:12 Spacecraft: (Music: The Lusty Month of May from "Camelot", performed by Julie Andrews and ensemble.)
Long comm break.
That sounded like a smattering of "Camelot" coming to us from the spacecraft. The small portable tape recorders carried by the crew. And at the present time we show Apollo 14 118 703 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 4973 feet per second.
'Camelot' is a stage musical based on the legend of King Arthur, and premiered on Broadway in 1960. The original cast was headlined by Richard Burton, Julie Andrews and Robert Goulet. A movie adaptation was released in 1967.
190:18:21 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. Over.
190:18:25 Shepard: Go ahead, Houston.
190:18:26 McCandless: 14, we're still working on these docking probe procedures. And we'll give you a call later on today when we've got them finalized. Over.
190:18:39 Shepard: Okeydoke, Bruce. That will be fine.
190:18:41 McCandless: And, for our information, can you tell us whether the contingency lunar sample decontamination bag is available in the Command Module or whether you jettisoned that with the LM? Over.
190:19:00 Shepard: Bruce, I'm not sure we can answer that without some looking around. It may be here, or we may have used it. Just a minute.
190:19:06 McCandless: Okay; well, we don't need an answer immediately. We're considering using this bag, if it's available, to go over the head of the docking probe, in order to protect it from any salt spray after splashdown. Over.
190:19:21 Shepard: Okay, we'll try and get an answer for you.
190:19:23 McCandless: Thank you.
190:20:09 McCandless: 14, this is Houston. On our last request, that won't be required. We've got two other bag candidates that we've identified, and we can use one of them. Over.
190:20:23 Mitchell: That'll be fine, if they didn't go to the same place as the contingency sample bag.
190:20:27 McCandless: No; what we're talking about is one of the temporary stowage bags with the - the purse assembly up at the top cut off - or the bag in which the hoses for the liquid transfer demo are stowed. Over.
190:20:46 Mitchell: Okay. We've got another little - got another alternative for you. I can see our shaving kit -razor bag sitting here, or the exerciser bag should be about the same size and work very well.
190:21:03 McCandless: I'm getting some headshakes down here, Ed, that says those bags won't fit over the head of the probe.
190:21:14 Mitchell: Neither of them? Doesn't matter to us. We'll put anything over it you like.
190:21:23 McCandless: Okay, we can go and try those out on the mockup. We had not. tried to fit those two bags that you mentioned. We do believe that - we know that the temporary stowage bag or the liquid transfer demo hose bags will fit. We'll get back to you - -
190:21:42 Mitchell: Okay, fine. Either one of those will be great.
190:21:44 McCandless: All right; we'll get back to you later on with the finalized procedure. Thank you.
190:21:49 Mitchell: Okay.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 190 hours 59 minutes. It's been very quiet, both in the control center and aboard the spacecraft, for the past hour or so. Our crew will be coming up shortly on an eat period. Now this will be their noon meal, or lunch, and following that they will be scheduled to do a fuel cell purge and will be maintaining passive thermal control aboard the spacecraft, rotating the vehicle at the rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to maintain the proper temperature control. The return-to-Earth officer is in the process of computing what's called another vector - computing another - taking another look at the data and computing another trajectory vector to determine whether or not midcourse correction 6 will be required, however, his last report to the Flight Director was that it was - that the possibilities or the chances of doing that midcourse correction were virtually zero, and we expect that we will have a firm decision to that effect before too much longer. At the present time, Apollo 14 is 116,100 nautical miles and the velocity has gone over the 5,000 foot per second mark now - 5,054 feet per second. Coming up at about 192 hours 40 minutes - 192:39:45, to be more precise - Apollo 14 will have completed half of its trans-Earth leg of the journey and at that time will be about 110,931 nautical miles from both the Earth and the Moon.
The 5,000-ft/s mark is not very interesting for any technical reason, simply another milestone.
The PAO notes here that in terms of distance, they reached the halfway point at 192:39:45 GET. The PAO commented that in terms of travel time, the halfway point was reached at approximately 183:10 GET. At that time they were some 137,000 nautical miles from Earth.
191:01:48 McCandless: Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over.
191:01:53 Mitchell: Houston, 14. Go ahead.
191:01:56 McCandless: In looking at your flight-plan activities for this afternoon, since we are still holding on the final probe stowage procedures, we're wondering how you'd feel about doing some of the light-flash stuff during the next hour here. Over.
191:02:25 Shepard: I thought we originally discussed that as a replacement for the midcourse.
191:02:30 McCandless: We did. However, we're now looking at the possibility of getting the probe tied down, roughly in this time period, instead. And one of the items that we're going to use, - or planning to use in tying down the probe is a rendezvous window shade, and it would be hard to get good dark adaptation inside after using the window shade as a shim. Over.
191:03:05 Shepard: It would also be hard to sleep this evening after using the rendezvous window shade as a shim.
191:03:35 McCandless: Roger, 14. But looking ahead in the time line for the activities coming up tomorrow - that is, after your sleep period this evening, it looks like you're going to be relatively busy, and we'd like to allocate about an hour, or maybe even a little more, to - to getting the probe configured and properly tied down in its position. And, I guess, if - We've been looking for a good place to fit that in, and we don't see an obvious slot in tomorrow's Flight Plan, although we could take another look at rearranging things somewhat. Over.
191:04:21 Shepard: Oh, I completely agree. I think we ought to get the probe stowed today and forget about it, Hold on just a minute; we'll look at the Flight Plan.
191:04:28 McCandless: There's a possibility we could rig some sort of a temporary window shade that might not give you complete blackness, but it could be - say, taped in place and would make it dark enough inside for sleeping. Over.
191:04:48 Shepard: Well, perhaps - possibly, you could put the window shade in place under the probe, get the ... on it, and remove it tonight, and then slip it back in tomorrow as the last step, and put it down with ...
191:05:10 McCandless: As I say, Al, we haven't got the final procedure bought off on yet; but, looking at the interim one here, the present location of it would be underneath a book from the flight data file and on top of a sleeping bag down on the aft heat shield, with the probe strapped down pretty tightly against it, using the window cover to spread out the force from one of the pitch arms, so that it doesn't concentrate excessively on the aft heatshield - so that if you get it tied down very securely, it may be difficult to get that window shil [sic] - window shade in and out after tying it down. Over.
191:05:55 Shepard: Okay. Well, how's about looking at something else in place of the window shade, because we'd like to get a good night's sleep tonight, if we can.
191:06:03 McCandless: Okay. We'll look at it.
Comm break.
