Al Shepard and Ed Mitchell have completed their two moonwalks and gathered a good haul of new lunar samples. Now safely packed up in Lunar Module Antares, it will soon become spaceborne again for a rendezvous with their mothership Kitty Hawk. New procedures are to be tried for the first time in conducting this meet-up in space, which adds some extra excitement to this crucial part of the mission. All indications are still for a perfectly nominal lift-off.
Editor's note: All transcript times are presented according to the GET update at 054:53:36 that saw the mission timer moved forward 40 minutes, 2.90 seconds.
141:21:00 : BEGIN LUNAR REV 31
141:31:00 Shepard-LM: Okay, Houston. The antenna blew over.
141:31:04 McCandless: Roger, Antares.
Al Shepard's reference to the antenna blowing over referred to the S-band erectable antenna on the lunar surface, and as on Apollo 12, when the crew fired the reaction control system jets to check them out, the thrust from those jets blew over the antenna. We're 53 minutes now from ignition, from lunar lift off. Progressing smoothly toward that event, about 10 minutes 25 seconds from reacquiring Kitty Hawk on its 31st revolution of the Moon.
This is Apollo Control at 141 hours 37 minutes, and we're now 48 minutes, 45 seconds from lunar lift off. The crew at this time, somewhat ahead of the Flight Plan, presently aligning the platform, on their Lunar Module guidance system, this is the stable reference number which is used by the onboard guidance system in determining spacecraft attitude. This is Apollo Control. We're about 50 seconds now from reacquiring Kitty Hawk, the Command Module in its 31st revolution of the Moon. We're using a dual capsule communicator set up in Mission Control at this time. Bruce McCandless is CapCom for the Lunar Module, Antares, and Ron Evans is CapCom for Stu Roosa in Kitty Hawk. At acquisition, Evans plans to pass along to Roosa, the fact that we do not expect to have Manned Space Flight Network relay of the ascent. Normally, when we have the high gain antenna operating properly on the Command Module, the Manned Space Flight Network would be used to relay communications from Antares to the Command Module. This will not be done because the Command Module high gain antenna is not locking up in narrow beam width. Roosa will get his communications from the Lunar Module, via the VHF communications circuit, which will be put into activation shortly after orbital insertion. And we have acquisition now of Kitty Hawk.
141:45:02 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston. Are you having an SOS sandwich there for lunch?
An SOS sandwich is a military staple food, consisting of chipped beef over toast. 'SOS' apparently stands for either 'Same old Stuff' or 'Shit on a Shingle'.
141:45:09 Roosa: Not quite, but I sure wish it was.
141:45:12 Evans: (Laughter) Okay. When you get a chance there, Stu, you can go ahead and terminate Bat A charge.
141:45:24 Roosa: Okay. I'll do it right now.
141:45:27 Evans: Okay. And while you're floating over there, you might be advised that the TPI Delta-V will probably be - more than likely be - around 100 feet a second instead of about 90 or so, you know?
141:45:44 Roosa: Okay.
141:45:50 Evans: And your ascent PADs are good the way they are.
141:45:58 Roosa: Okay.
141:45:59 Evans: Antares is pressing on in good shape there. They're getting set for the liftoff, about 39 minutes yet. And, as you might notice here, we're on separate air-to-ground loops. So I'll be talking to you through this pass, and I'll relay all information on up to you. When you go to the P20 attitude, the Omni antennas just make all kinds of noise racket down here, so I may not be able to hear you, but I think you've been hearing me most of the time. So I'll just go ahead and relay, probably in the blind, most of the time line.
141:46:40 Roosa: All right.
Comm break.
141:50:58 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston.
141:51:02 Roosa: Go ahead.
141:51:04 Evans: Okay, Stu, we're going to bring the probe back with us, or you guys are, anyhow. And for TEI, just go ahead and stow it underneath the right-hand couch - you know, with the straps like we normally do, there, for temporary storage. And then, on the way - -
141:51:26 Roosa: Okay.
141:51:27 Evans: - - back, we'll give you some permanent stowage instructions, during transearth coast. Also, your VHF acquisition time - that's when you come over the horizon for the VHF there - will be 142:20:18.
The probe has to be properly secured into the cabin. The g forces generated by their reentry might tear it loose and cause it to slam onto equipment, the crew, or their hull.
This is Apollo Control. We're now 33 minutes from lunar lift off. Aboard the Command Module Kitty Hawk, Stu Roosa at this time is getting suited up, and CapCom Ron Evans has advised Roosa that he will be relaying on the separate air to ground link the progress of the lunar lift off. Ed Mitchell and Al Shepard aboard Antares on the lunar surface have just completed the alignment of their guidance system platform, and CapCom Ron Evans will bepassing up to Stu Roosa some information on stowing the probe assembly in the Command Module. The plan is to return the probe and it will be stowed under one of the couches in the Command Module Kitty Hawk.
141:51:58 Roosa: Okay, 142:20:18; and, Ron, I'm going to be off the comm here, probably about 4 or 5 minutes.
141:52:06 Evans: Okay; understand.
141:55:48 Roosa: Okay, Ron; I'm back on.
141:55:51 Evans: Okay; mighty fine, Stu.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 142 hours. We're coming up now on 25 minutes until lunar lift off, things progressing smoothly at this time. Mitchell and Shepard aboard Antares have switched to the guidance program, in their on board guidance system program 12 which will be used in the powered ascent from the lunar surface, and the Lunar Module ascent stage batteries, batteries 5 and 6 look good at this time. The voltages are normally and they're sharing the load well.
142:02:43 Evans: Okay, Stu. It looks like you're getting about ready to maneuver, there. Just want to let you know the LM's in good shape. About the only thing that's even pending is the - their steerable antenna, and it looks like it may not be tracking correctly on the thing. So they may be using their Omni antennas.
142:03:07 Roosa: Okay.
142:03:27 Roosa: Okay, thank you, Ron. We'll see you on Omni Delta, here.
142:03:32 Evans: Okay. You may see me; I won't see you. We'll hope, maybe it'll work. Hey, by the way, that's a beautiful job whipping around out there - we got some real good selenodetic updates, and I'm sure we got a bunch of good pictures, by golly.
142:03:51 Roosa: Thank you.
At this time aboard Kitty Hawk Stu Roosa is maneuvering the Command Module to the proper attitude for the LM lift off. He'll have the CSM apex pointed toward the lunar surface, and capcom Ron Evans has advised Roosa that the Lunar Module appears to be in good shape for lift off, with the one problem of the LM steerable antenna which may give some problem in tracking and if it does, we'll be switching to one of the omni antennas on the Lunar Module. This is Apollo Control at 142 hours 6 minutes we're coming up now on 20 minutes until lunar lift off, and aboard Antares, Shepard and Mitchell will shortly begin pressurizing the ascent propulsion system. Here in the control center, the large plot boards, which will be used primarily by the flight dynamics officer, and the guidance officer for the lunar ascent, has come up. One of these displays in particular will be crucial to the flight dynamics officer, and that's the display which shows him altitude versus the rate of altitude gain. FIDO will use this display in determining whether the LM guidance system is putting the proper amount of energy into gaining altitude as opposed to gaining velocity. Initially the engine will be putting a larger percentage of this energy into altitude gain, later on in the burn the LM will be pitching over and the rate of altitude gain should drop off as the velocity gain begins to increase at an ever growing rate.
142:09:36 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston. The APS is pressurized. Antares has a Go for lift-off; direct rendezvous on this pass.
142:09:48 Roosa: Roger. Thank you, Ron.
142:09:53 Evans: Roger.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, we're now 15 minutes from lunar lift off. Everything looks good at this time, and we've given the crew a go for a direct ascent rendezvous with a nominal lift off time. Our lift off time, 142 hours 25 minutes 42 seconds.
This is Apollo Control at 142 hours 16 minutes, and we're coming up now on 10 minutes until lunar lift off. it's been relatively quiet here in the control center, also relatively little communications with Antares at this time. The powered ascent burn, scheduled to last about 7 minutes 12 seconds. At the end of that burn we should have achieved a velocity of about 55 hundred 43 feet per second. The electrical systems engineer, here in the control center, for the Lunar Module reports that those ascent batteries on the LM, which were a source of some concern prior to the power descent and the landing look good at this time. This is Apollo Control, now 5 minutes from lunar lift off. Everything still looking very good for that lift off and direct ascent rendezvous. At the time of lift off Stu Roosa in Kitty Hawk should be about 67 nautical miles behind the Lunar Module, and I have orbit insertions on 7 minutes 12 seconds later. The Command Module will be leading by about 135 nautical miles. Shortly before lift off Shepard and Mitchell aboard the Lunar Module are scheduled to make a VHF voice check with Roosa in the Command Module. We're now coming up on 4 minutes until lunar lift off.
142:20:17 Shepard (onboard): Okay, turn on Master Arm at 1 minute. You can start the camera. Ten seconds, Abort Stage, push; Engine Arm, Ascent. You give me a Pro at 5 and a 99.
142:20:29 Mitchell (onboard): Will do.
142:20:31 Shepard (onboard): And I'm going to push this son of a bitch at plus 1 second anyway. Even if it was Auto ignition- even if it wasn't Auto ignition, it's going to get pushed anyway.
142:20.45 Mitchell (onboard): Right. Well, I like your spirit (laughter).
142:20:51 Shepard (onboard): Okay. Yaw right, 30 and then we watch it.
142:21:05 Shepard-LM: Antares, Kitty Hawk. VHF voice check. How do you read me?
142:21:06 Shepard (onboard): Okay, you'll probably be going to B now to see what we've got.
142:21:08 Mitchell (onboard): Hell, it's quiet now. VHF B's quiet.
142:21:14 Shepard (onboard): Okay. I don't know what happened to it. Okay, it's - I think we have not settled. It's still about 6 and a half degrees.
142:21:23 Mitchell (onboard): Yes.
142:21:27 Shepard (onboard): Okay, all we have to do is hang on 4 more minutes.
142:21:37 Evans: Antares, Houston. Mark at 4 minutes. Stand by.
142:21:40 Shepard-LM: Antares to Kitty Hawk. VHF check. How do you read?
142:21:41 Evans: Mark. Four minutes.
142:21:44 Shepard (onboard): Okay, we're right with you. 240 thousand miles away. Okay, baby, we want you to fire. Ascent Helium, Press 2 is good. Helium 1 is good.
142:21:47 Shepard-LM: Okay. We're right with you.
142:21:49 Evans: Roger. Out.
142:21:53 Roosa: Well, I can read you somewhat.
142:21:59 Evans: And Antares, Kitty Hawk is trying to read you on VHF.
142:22:15 Shepard (onboard): Okay, Guidance, PGNS; Mode Select is in AGS;we're in H and H-do. WE're at Lo Mult; okay, we have computer, we're in PGNS; 25; Prop, Enable; 4 jets; Couples, On; Mode Control three, to Auto. Right on the money. Boy, my visor's so scratched up...
142:22:39 Mitchell (onboard): Mine is too.
142:22:40 Shepard (onboard): ...when the Sun shines in it, you can't even see...
142:22:42 Mitchell (onboard): See a cottonpicking thing. Okay, 3 minutes.
142:22:47 Shepard (onboard): And the light level will decrease soon.
142:22 50 Mitchell (onboard): Yes, it won't be quite as bad when we get a little higher.
142:23:07 Shepard-LM: Kitty Hawk, Antares. How do you read?
142:23:11 Roosa: Read you 3 by, Al. How me?
142:23:20 McCandless: Antares, Houston. Kitty Hawk is reading you 3 by on VHF.
142:23:29 Mitchell-LM: Roger. We're not reading him.
142:23:35 McCandless: Okay. We'll pass that to him.
142:23:38 Mitchell-LM: And Antares is counting - counting down to 2 minutes. 3,2,1...
142:23:45 Mitchell-LM: Mark. Two minutes and counting.
142:23:47 McCandless: We concur.
142:23:50 Shepard (onboard): You son of a bitch. Okay, Audio Mode, both Vox.
They will now switch their communications from Push to Talk mode to Voice Activated, or Vox mode.
142:23:54 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston. Little less than 2 minutes; everything is Go.
142:23:56 Mitchell (onboard): All right, Vox.
142:24:02 Roosa: Okay, Houston.
142:24:03 Shepard-LM: 400, set 10000.
This is an entry Ed makes into the DEDA for the AGS. Selecting 400 + 10000 commands the AGS to orient itself for an upcoming engine burn.
142:24:13 Mitchell-LM: Okay, 400...
142:24:14 Shepard-LM: 400 plus 10000.
142:24:20 Mitchell-LM: Plus 10000.
142:24:22 Shepard-LM: Okay.
142:24:23 Mitchell-LM: Watch is reset.
142:24:29 Shepard-LM: Okay, Houston. Master Arm is On. The A and B lights are on. Okay. 367 readout and...
Al makes a reference to Address 367, which allows them to monitor the LM Altitude rate (or the H dot) on the DEDA.
142:24:39 McCandless: Roger. We confirm both systems Armed.
142:24:40:Shepard-LM: ...one. Okay.
142:24:44 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston. Antares has got ascent engine on.
142:24:53:Roosa: Okay. How do you read, Antares?
142:24:54 Shepard-LM: There's our boy. Reading you loud and clear. We are 45 seconds and counting.
142:25:02 Shepard-LM: Roger. I - I've been reading you. You're coming through loud and clear.
142:25:06 Shepard-LM: Okay, be up to see you shortly.
142:25:07 Mitchell-LM: Okay. Hello.
142:25:09 Roosa: Roger. I'm waiting.
142:26:11 Shepard-LM: Okay. DSKYs on time.
142:25:14 Mitchell-LM: Have a nice cool one set up.
142:25:33 Shepard-LM: Okay. The abort stage is set. Ascent Engine is Armed. 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0...
142:25:45 Mitchell-LM: Ignition.
142:25:46 Shepard-LM: We have ignition...
142:25:47 Mitchell-LM: What a lift off!
The Ascent Propulsion System generates some 3,500 pound of thrust in the lunar vacuum, and with the LM Ascent Stage's reported mass of 10,779.8 pounds, this amounts to an acceleration of 0.32 g's at liftoff.
142:25:48 Shepard-LM: and Lift-Off.
142:25:49 Evans: Roger. Ignition.
142:25:55 Mitchell-LM:...pitchover.
142:25:56 Shepard-LM: There's pitchover. 10 seconds.
For the first 10 seconds, the Ascent Stage rises vertically to clear the lunar surface, before they start pitching for the purpose of starting to accelerate into orbital velocity.
142:25:57 Evans: Roger.
142:26:00 Mitchell-LM: Okay, baby.
142:26:01 Shepard-LM: Pitchover's good.
142:26:06 Evans: We confirm Auto ignition.
142:26:11 Shepard-LM: That's affirmative. Auto ignition.
142:26:22: Mitchell-LM: And here we're going across Cat's Paw.
142:26:28 Shepard-LM: Watch the ball. Everything looks good, Houston.
142:26:39 Evans: Roger. You're looking good from down here, Al.
142:26:40 Shepard-LM: Coming up on 1 minute.
142:26:42 Mitchell-LM: Al...
142:26:43 Shepard-LM: 2, 1...

142:29:51 Shepard-LM: ...Pitch is good.
142:29:52 Mitchell-LM: H-dot is good; H is good, AGS are right together.
142:30:02 Evans: Antares, Houston. You're Go from the ground; looking good.
142:30:08 Shepard-LM: Okay.
142:30:17 Evans: Antares, Houston. We show all sources, PGNS, AGS, and MSFN, in good agreement.
142:30:25 Mitchell-LM: That's good.
142:30:26 Shepard-LM: Okay, thank you. About 225 to go, and the plane looks good.
142:30:34 Mitchell-LM: Looking better. That's good.
142:30:37 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston. PGNS, AGS and MSFN are all in good agreement.
142:30:40 Shepard-LM: Now, you can stop your camera, if you want.
142:30:44 Mitchell-LM: Okay. [Garble].
142:30:46 Roosa: Thank you.
142:30:48 Shepard-LM: Okay. We're going to be on [garble] at 5:30.

142:34:44 Shepard (onboard): Okay.
142:34:47 Mitchell-LM: Roger.
That tweak burn will touch up the orbit to get us in the desired 51 by 9.
142:34:45 Mitchell (onboard): Roger. All right, Inverter 1 circuit breaker, open.
142:34:47 Shepard (onboard): Just a minute. Let me get the - Be sure I got the right attitude. I'm in attitude.
142:34:51 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
142:34:52 Shepard (onboard): Okay. Inverter 1 breaker's open.
142:34:56 Mitchell (onboard): Did you get plus or minus 5 Shaft/Trunnion?
142:34:57 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston. Are you copying the LM VHF?
142:34:58 Shepard (onboard): Affirmative.
142:34:59 Mitchell (onboard): Logic Power.
142:35:00 Evans: Antares, this is Houston. Tweak TIG 142:36:51. Delta-V: X. minus 2.0; Y, plus 5.0; Z, minu 8.0;and this is it the nominal yaw 30 attitude. Read back. Over.

142:35:23 Roosa: That's affirmative, Ron. I am reading them loud and clear.
142:35:25 Evans: Okay. Mighty fine. And, Kitty Hawk; Houston. There will be a tweak burn.
142:35:35 Evans: Antares, Houston. Did you copy the tweak burn? Over.
142:35:40 Roosa: Understand. There will be a tweak.
142:35:42 Evans: Affirmative.
142:35:43 Shepard-LM: That's affirmative, Houston. We're setting up for it now.
142:35:46 Mitchell-LM: Roger. 142:36:51, and minus 2.0, plus 5.0, minus 8.0.
142:35:53 Evans: Roger, Ed.
142:35:54 Shepard (onboard): What was that TIG again?
142:35:58 Mitchell (onboard): 36:51, Al.
142:36:00 Shepard (onboard): Okay. 47's called up.
142:36:04 Mitchell (onboard): Getting AGS set up for you. Which axis you gonna do first?
142:36:08 Shepard (onboard): Okay, what's the biggest?
142:36:09 Mitchell (onboard): Biggest one is Z - minus Z.
142:36:15 Shepard (onboard): Minus Z is minus 8?
142:36:17 Mitchell (onboard): Minus 8.
142:36:18 Shepard (onboard): Okay, we'll do that first.
142:36:21 Evans: X, Z, Y, Ed. X, Z, Y. Over.
142:36:24 Mitchell (onboard): Do X, Z, Y. Al, they want X, Z, Y.
142:36:27 Shepard (onboard): Okay. 36 what?
142:36:32 Mitchell (onboard): 51, 20 seconds.
142:36:33 Shepard (onboard): And the first one is X, and that'll be what?
142:36:37 Mitchell (onboard): That's minus 2.
142:36:39 Shepard (onboard): Minus 2.0. Minus 2.0?
142:36:43 Mitchell (onboard): Minus 2.0.
142:36:44 Shepard (onboard): Okay.
142:36:51 Mitchell (onboard): Ready? Give it...
142:36:52 Shepard (onboard): We're burning.
142:37:01 Mitchell (onboard): Good.
142:37:02 Shepard (onboard): Okay.
142:37:05 Mitchell (onboard): B is minus 8.
142:37:08 Shepard (onboard): Minus 8?
142:37:10 Mitchell (onboard): B, minus 8. Knocking down Z.
142:37:13 Shepard (onboard): Okay.
142:37:14 Mitchell (onboard): Burn. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 - 6, 7, 1 foot more.
142:37:34 Shepard (onboard): Okay.
142:37:36 Mitchell (onboard): That looks good. 471 -
142:37:38 Shepard (onboard): That's about - out of plane?
142:37:44 Mitchell (onboard): Out of plane is plus 5 right, 2 and a half, 4 and a half; that's great. Right there. Hold it.
142:37:57 Shepard-LM: Hey, Houston, Tweak's complete.
142:37:59 Mitchell-LM: It's good old P47. Okay. 8.
142:38:00 Evans: Roger;out.
142:38:03 Shepard (onboard): Okay.
142:38:04 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
142:38:07 Shepard (onboard): ...get in attitude.
142:38:08 Mitchell (onboard): Right.
142:38:09 Shepard (onboard): Okay. Well do it in Rate Command. We got plenty of RCS? Yes.
142:38:14 Evans: Antares, Houston. You're Go for the APS TPI. APS TPI.
142:38:15 Mitchell (onboard): Pardon.
142:38:22 Mitchell-LM: Roger. Thank you.
That tweaking over performed with the reaction control system thrusters on the LM have put the spacecraft in the proper position for the transfer phase initiation and the direct descent rendezvous. We'll be standing by for the report from the FIDO on initiation time for the TPI burn and also the velocity required.
142:38:39 Evans: Okay, Kitty Hawk; Houston. You're Go for a direct rendezvous.
142:38:43 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. You're slewing. Okay. When you get just a second - did you get Logic Power circuit breakers open?
142:38:50 Shepard (onboard): Logic Power A's open.
142:38:51 Mitchell (onboard): Cabin Fan circuit breaker, closed. Cabin Fan 1-
142:38:57 Shepard (onboard): Wait just a minute, Ed.
142:38:58 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
142:39:26 McCandless: Antares, Houston. How do you read?
142:39:32 Shepard-LM: Loud and clear Bruce. I'll lock up for you as soon as we're in position.
142:39:36 McCandless: Roger. Reading you the same.
142:39:43 Shepard (onboard): Okay. We're about in altitude now. Okay, what are those breakers again?
142:39:46 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. Cabin Fan 1.
142:39:47 Shepard (onboard): It's out. Do you want it out or in?
142:39:52 Mitchell (onboard): I want it in.
142:39:53 Shepard (onboard): Okay. It's in.
142:39:56 Mitchell (onboard): Okay, Houston.
142:39:59 Mitchell-LM: We're locked up on the steerable.
142:40:00 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. Rendezvous rate - Rendezvous Radar mode LGC -
142:40:03 Evans: Loud and clear, Ed.
142:40:06 Shepard (onboard): Okay...
142:40:07 Mitchell (onboard): ...Call P20.
P20 is Program 20, Rendezvous Navigation. It is used for attitude control and for acquisition and tracking of the Command Module using the Rendezvous Radar.
142:40:08 Shepard (onboard): 20's called.
142:40:10 Mitchell (onboard): Verb 80.
142:40:11 Shepard (onboard): Well, we haven't -
142:40:13 Mitchell (onboard): Oh - -
142:40:14 Shepard (onboard): - - Locked it yet.
142:40:15 Mitchell (onboard): Haven't got it up yet.
142:40:16 Shepard (onboard): No. Searching now.
142:40:22 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston; we're still checking your vector. You're not ...
142:40:25 Mitchell (onboard): Pardon.
142:40:26 Shepard (onboard): I say it's searching now. I don't have a visual.
142:40:30 Roosa: Okay, I was just going to start on that when I got a Go on it. My- VHF won't stay locked on, Ron. It'll just flash me a Range and then drop right back off again. Anybody got any good ideas?
142:40:36 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. We'll give him a tracking light.
142:40:46 Evans: Okay, let me check the - You say your VHF won't stay locked on. It locks on and then comes right back out again. Is that correct?
142:40:56 Roosa: That's affirmative. It just flashes me a Range and then drops right back to zero.
142:40:59 Shepard (onboard): Okay. It's found him. Okay. 000003, we'll take that. We - -
142:41:02 Evans: Okay.
142:41:14 Evans: Antares, Houston. No state vector updates are required. Over.
142:41:20 Mitchell-LM: Roger. Thank you.
142:41:22 Mitchell (onboard): You move your hand a minute, Al?
142:41:23 Shepard (onboard): You. You want a Pro on that?
142:41:24 Evans: And Stu reports he's having problems locking on in VHF.
142:41:32 Mitchell-LM: Okay.
142:41:35 Shepard (onboard): You haven't got a 50 18.
142:41:41 Mitchell (onboard): Beg your pardon.
142:41:42 Shepard (onboard): You don't get a 50 18.
142:41:44 Mitchell (onboard): Not when you're within 10 degrees.
142:41:49 Shepard (onboard): Okay. We'll go to Auto and see what it does.
142:41:52 Mitchell (onboard): Am I supposed to have the tape recorder still on?
142:41:54 Shepard (onboard): I don't know.
142:41:56 Mitchell (onboard): Should be a turnoff here somewhere. I guess not. Wel'l leave it on. I haven't got anything to do with it but run it out anyhow.
142:41:57 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston. LM update - or LM state vector update is not required. You're Go the way it is. And any better luck on the VHF?
142:42:05 Shepard (onboard): Okay. Let's get a Verb 80 going. Okay. And call 34.
142:42:11 Mitchell (onboard): 34. Okay. We can set the - counting down to TPI.
142:42:12 Roosa: Okay. No, it's still the same.
142:42:26 Shepard (onboard): Okay. Have you got a TIG for me?
142:42:27 Mitchell (onboard): Have it in just a second.
142:42:28 Shepard (onboard): Okay.
142:42:28 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston. I just can't read you.
142:42:35 Mitchell (onboard): TIG is 143:10:54, Al.
142:42:41 Shepard (onboard): 25 Enter; plus 143 Enter; plus 10 Enter; plus 54.00. Right?
142:42:56 Mitchell (onboard): Yes. Let me say it again., 143:10:54.00. That's a good number.
142:42:57 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston. Transmitting kind of in the blind here, because I can't read you; but go ahead and try to take the VHF monitor, and see if you get a tracking light or not.
This is Apollo Control, at 142 hours, 43 minutes and we're now about 12 minutes 30 seconds from losing contact with the Command Module. We'll lose contact with the LM as it goes behind the Moon about one minute earlier due to the fact that the LM is in a lower orbit than the Command Module, Kitty Hawk.
142:43:02 Shepard (onboard): Noun 37 is 143:10:54.00.
142:43:05 Mitchell (onboard): That's a good number.
142:43:06 Shepard (onboard): Okay, Pro. It might not enter. Okay.
142:43:10 Roosa: That's affirmative. I do.
142:43:12 Mitchell (onboard): Operator Error; okay.
142:43:13 Shepard (onboard): Yes, I got that.
142:43:14 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
142:43:15 Shepard (onboard): Okay. We want a zero, we want a zero, we want a 130. Right?
142:43:19 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
142:43:23 Shepard (onboard): You marked early. Okay. Let's get the COAS on; this is getting ready to go. Okay. What's next?
142:43:34 Evans: And, Kitty Hawk; you want to be sure and make sure that the Antares remains quiet on the VHF there while we're trying to lock up on the thing.
142:43:46 McCandless: Antares, this is Houston. We believe that the Command Module VHF ranging lock problem may be due to the conversation on the loop. Your conversation even over the intercom within the LM is enough to break it up an inhibit lock; so maybe you can get Stu to give you a mark when he's ready to throw the Ranging Reset switch, and then remain silent for about 20 seconds, both spacecraft. Over.
142:44:07 Shepard (onboard): Understand.
142:44:12 Mitchell-LM: Roger. We understand. Give us a call, Stu, when you need it.
142:45:23 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston. It looks like the VHF may have - may have locked up after your Noun 49 value you had on it.
142:45:37 Roosa (onboard):(garble)
142:45:37 Roosa: Yes. It's going okay.
142:45:41 Shepard (onboard): Okay, Ed. You got an Orb Rate ball.
142:45:43 Evans: Okay.
142:45:45 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. Coming up.
142:45:51 Shepard (onboard): You got an Orb Ball.
142:45:52 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
142:45:58 Shepard (onboard): Through?
142:46:02 Shepard (onboard): Are you through with 54?
142:46:04 Mitchell (onboard): Yes, I'm through with it.
This is Apollo Control at 142 hours 46 minutes and we're now about 8 minutes from loss of signal with the LM. Stu Roosa aboard the Command Module, Kitty Hawk, now has gotten VHF lock up with the Lunar Module and has ranging to the LM and the Lunar Module is also getting range information on Kitty Hawk. The transfer phase initiation maneuver at about 100 feet per second will be performed while the spacecraft is behind the Moon and when we reacquire they should be beginning the breaking phase on the direct approach to the Command Module and the final portion of the rendezvous and we'll begin station keeping as the spacecraft comes back around and into contact with Mission Control.
142:47:42 McCandless: Antares, this is Houston. We're being informed that all systems are looking good. In particular, BATs 5 and 6 are normal, and you're in good shape trajectory-wise going around the corner. We've got 6 and one-half-minutes to LOS and we anticipate having a ground TPI solution for you prior to LOS. Over.
142:47:57 Shepard (onboard): He said everything's looking good but then he lost us.
142:47:59 Mitchell (onboard): Yes, we broke - popped the S-Band Antenna breaker again.
142:48:06 Shepard (onboard): Yes, was just like in the LMS and CMS. I don't see him.
142:48:14 Mitchell-LM: Houston, Antares. I lost my S-Band Antenna breaker again.
142:48:32 Evans: Antares, this is Houston.
142:48:39 Shepard-LM: Go ahead, Houston.
142:48:42 Evans: Antares, Houston. Request Aft Omni and Lo Bit Rate:
142:48:49 Shepard-LM: Okay.
142:48:52 Mitchell-LM: And you have it.
142:48:54 Evans: And it looks like your present attitude is blocking the steerable antenna from pointing at the Earth.
142:49:06 Mitchell-LM: Maybe so, but it also popped a circuit breaker.
142:49:10 Evans: Roger. If it runs into the stop, I believe it will.
142:49:16 Mitchell-LM: It didn't. It popped just before it went to the stop.
142:49:19 Evans: Roger. Out.
As you've heard in that last exchange with Ed Mitchell on Antares, we've had a dropout of the LM steerable antenna. We're now using the Omni antennas on the Lunar Module. And at the present time, our data here in Mission Control shows the two spacecrafts to be about 75 miles apart.
142:49:34 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. Range rate, 349, 3 - 000...
142:50:10 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston. Your vehicle's in good shape. You've got about 5 minutes to LOS here. And, Stu, you're accepting all the optics monitor in good shape. You probably better go ahead and accept the VHF monitor, also.
142:51:14 Shepard (onboard): Okay. It's looking pretty good so far.
142:51:16 Mitchell (onboard): Sure is.
142:51:24 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston.
142:51:24 Shepard (onboard): Sure you're on VHF B, Receive, now?
142:51:25 Mitchell (onboard): I'm on B, Receive, yes.
142:51:27 Shepard (onboard): With all that noise?
142:51:27 Roosa: Go ahead, Houston.
142:51:32 Mitchell (onboard): Yes. That's the weird noises that Cernan was talking about.
142:51:33 Evans: Okay. Stu, it looks like we're getting some bad VHF spots in there. Just reinitialize the W-matrix and go sextant only - sextant only. So, mark it.
142:51:47 Roosa: Okay. You say reinitialize? I've already accepted one.
142:52:02 Shepard (onboard): Okay. Eighteen minutes. Should be 20...ECS.
142:52:08 Evans: Kitty Hawk, don't worry about the W-matrix on the ground. Just press on. Accept sextant marks only.
142:52:19 Roosa: It's too late. I've already Initialized it.
142:52:32 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston. Request Omni Bravo.
142:53:08 Evans: Antares, Houston Comm check; over.
142:53:14 Shepard-LM: Loud and clear, Houston. How me?
142:53:16 Evans: Roger. Out.
142:53:27 Mitchell (onboard): Core tube stopper.
142:53:31 Shepard (onboard): Yes.
142:53:37 Mitchell (onboard): What time's LOS?
142:53:39 Shepard (onboard): Okay; LOS in a couple of minutes.
142:53:43 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
142:53:43 Evans: Apollo 14, this is Houston. LM TPI ground solution, Delta-V; X plus 63 feet per second; Y plus 1; Z, plus 67. I say again, LM TPI Delta-V: X, plus 63.0; Y, plus 1.0; Z, plus 67.0. Antares, Over.
142:54:13 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston. Looks like the best ground solution we have down there for the LM is about as written. It's plus 63.0, plus 1.0, and plus 67.O.
142:54:13 Mitchell-LM: Roger. Copy plus 63, plus 1, plus 67, thank you.
142:54:20 Evans: Roger. Out. Ten seconds to LOS. Go get them. See you on the other side, Ed.
142:54:26 Mitchell (onboard): Yes, we lost them.
142:54:37 Mitchell (onboard): Okay, what's for LOS procedures, Al? You got them there?
142:54:43 Shepard (onboard): Okay. Track Mode Slew; S-Band Antenna, Aft.
142:54:47 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
142:54:48 Mitchell (onboard): Set Pitch, plus 114.
142:54:49 Evans: Kitty Hawk, Houston. About 30 seconds; you're looking good. We'll see you on the other side.
142:54:51 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
142:54:53 Shepard (onboard): Yaw, minus 46.
142:54:54 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
142:54:56 Shepard (onboard): Biomed, Off.
142:54:57 Mitchell (onboard): Biomed, Off.
142:54:58 Shepard (onboard): PCM, Lo.
142:54:59 Mitchell (onboard): PCM is Lo.
142:55:02 Shepard (onboard): Uplink Squelch, Enable.
142:55:03 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. It's Enable.
142:55:47 Shepard (onboard): Anyway, I didn't make the...pullouts.
142:55:52 Mitchell (onboard): Isn't this supposed to be cut - cut through?
142:55:55 Shepard (onboard): Is it?
142:55:56 Mitchell (onboard): Yes.
142:55:57 Shepard (onboard): It's not. See how I can slide it back and forth?
142:56:31 Shepard (onboard): There he is.
142:56:33 Mitchell (onboard): Find him?
142:56:35 Shepard (onboard): Yes. There's sunlight on him.
142:56:46 Mitchell (onboard): Give me a Verb 82. Let's see how we agree.
Verb 82 is "Request Orbital Parameter Display"
142:56:49 Shepard (onboard): Looks just like a star.
142:56:56 Mitchell (onboard): Ooh I'd like to get these helmet and gloves off.
142:57:01 Shepard (onboard): You want to take them of?
142:57:02 Mitchell (onboard): What?
142:57:04 Shepard (onboard): Want to take them off?
142:57:06 Mitchell (onboard): Yes I'd like to (laughter) There's no crap in the cat - in the cockpit.
142:57:13 Shepard (onboard): 8.65 by 50.9.
142:57:17 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. I've got 50.3 by 4 - let's see, 403; 8.4, so that's - we're right together Al.
142:57:30 Shepard (onboard): Okay. And it looks good, babe.
142:57:34 Mitchell (onboard): Good solutions.
142:57:40 Shepard (onboard): Looks good. Oh I'm sorry - It's not him - it is not he. Thought he was moving, but he's not - just - don't see him at all.
142:57:49 Mitchell (onboard): Verb 62.
Verb 62
142:57:52 Shepard (onboard): Glad we're not doing this visually.
142:58:23 Mitchell (onboard): 4.1.
142:58:52 Shepard (onboard): Everything's looking good. Everything's quiet.
142:58:56 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. I'm going to retarget PGNS here, I mean AGS here. 514, 00000, 515. Move your hand a bit. There's the problem. Plus 4 all zeros, 516, plus 00000. Enter.
We've had loss of contact now with Antares. We'll be loosing contact with Kitty Hawk in about 45 seconds. This is Apollo Control at 142 hours 59 minutes. We'll be reacquiring the Lunar Module, Antares in about 43 minutes 40 seconds. We'll pick up the Command Module a bit earlier, again because of the higher orbit that the Command Module is in, reacquiring Kitty Hawk in about 42 minutes. By the time that we acquire, the crew will have performed the transfer phase initiation burn. That will be about 85 feet per second, performed with the ascent propulsion system engine. It'll be a posigrade maneuver, and as we reacquire the spacecraft, that will be on the line of sight closing, preparing to do their braking maneuvers, and shortly after reacquiring, they should begin station keeping. At the present time, our displays predict that the separation distance between the 2 spacecraft is about 51 nautical miles, closing at a rate of about 231 feet per second. At 143 hours this is Apollo Control, Houston.
142:59:58 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
143:00:07 Shepard (onboard): Okay. Everything's going very nicely.
143:01:03 Mitchell (onboard): Sounded like Stu went off the air.
143:01:05 Shepard (onboard): Yes, it sure does.
143:01:07 Mitchell (onboard): Thought he was starting to - took a Reset Ranging set.
143:01:10 Shepard (onboard): Oh yes,...any good.
143:01:14 Mitchell (onboard): ...2,4, 42....
143:01:18 Shepard (onboard): Sure are noisy.
143:01:45 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. I'm ready to - How about that - there's no use in being this miserable. Do you want to break helmets and gloves?
143:01:59 Shepard (onboard): Well, we'll - we can put them on just before docking, can't we?
143:02:02 Mitchell (onboard): We can.
143:02:04 Shepard (onboard): The only thing is we'll have a different configuration on the Cabins.
143:02:07 Mitchell (onboard): What we need to do is go Cabin, Cabin.
143:02:12 Shepard (onboard): Well, Auto on both, Cabin Gas Return.
143:02:15 Mitchell (onboard): Auto on both of those.
143:02:28 Shepard (onboard): Is Cabin holding?
143:02:31 Mitchell (onboard): I don't see any flow;it had been holding. It hadn't moved.
143:02:35 Shepard (onboard): Okay.
143:02:36 Roosa (onboard): Okay, Antares, I ... maneuver.
143:02:41 Mitchell (onboard): Okay, Stu.
143:02:56 Shepard (onboard): Okay. We're in final Comp, 34.
143:03:02 Roosa (onboard): Okay.
143:03:18 Shepard (onboard): Okay. You want to copy down the solution?
143:03:20 Mitchell (onboard): Yes. Just a second here.
143:03:35 Shepard (onboard): You're going to have a transfer angle of 30 degrees.
143:03:43 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. Let's have a solution, Noun 55. I don't need -
143:03:49 Shepard (onboard): Begin transferring with 30 degrees.
143:03:51 Mitchell (onboard): Just a minute. Let me write it down. Okay, you have 30.
143:03:58 Roosa (onboard): 30.16.
143:03:59 Mitchell (onboard): AGS says 29.86.
143:04:02 Shepard (onboard): Good show.
143:04:05 Mitchell (onboard): You'll have to move those four to burn because they'll end up down there. Okay, Noun 58 - are 446...
143:04:16 Shepard (onboard): 885, 287.
143:04:19 Mitchell (onboard): 885, 287. All right.
143:04:24 Shepard (onboard): Okay. Here we go. 81 - boy, it's close to the ground.
143:04:30 Mitchell (onboard): 621, plus 1, plus 631. That's pretty close to what - they gave us from the ground.
143:04:42 Shepard (onboard): It really is.
143:05:01 Shepard (onboard): Okay, Stu, did you read our Noun 81?
143:05:07 Roosa (onboard): Say again?
143:05:08 Shepard (onboard): Did you read our Noun 81?
143:05:11 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. We had 62 - plus 62 1, plus 0,1, plus 63 1, and I'll take yours.
143:05:22 Roosa (onboard):(garble)
143:05:33 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
143:05:36 Shepard (onboard): Getting pretty good on that sextant, huh?
143:05:40 Roosa (onboard): Yes ...
143:05:47 Mitchell (onboard): That's affirm. We have VHF Ranging on A and Receive on B.
143:05:53 Shepard (onboard): Do you want 59?
143:05:55 Mitchell (onboard): No, I don't care,
