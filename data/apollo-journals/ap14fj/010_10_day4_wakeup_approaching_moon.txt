After nearly 70 hours in space, Apollo 14 is soon to approach to its ultimate destination at lunar orbit. While the crew has been asleep, however, engineers going through the telemetry from last night's checkup of the Lunar Module's systems have detected a minor issue with one of the LM batteries. Although the problem does not appear to be critical, nothing is left to chance while dealing with such complex, sensitive machines.
Editor's note: All transcript times are presented according to the GET update at 054:53:36 that saw the mission timer moved forward 40 minutes, 2.90 seconds.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 69 hours, 47 minutes now in the flight of Apollo 14. We presently show the Apollo 14 spacecraft at a distance of 27,999 nautical miles [51,854 km] away from the Moon. And travelling at a speed of 3,353 feet per second [1,022 m/s]. We've had no contact with the crew now well into their rest period since our last report. However, in Mission Control, Flight Director, Pete Frank, has been holding discussions with Mr. Sig Sjoberg, Director of Flight Operations and Mission Director, Chet Lee and other , about the LM battery test being considered. This - a test on LM battery number five which had shown a low readout during the LM house-keeping activities early this morning. Battery number five voltage reading, both on the ground and through - crew readout read 36.7 volts, the normal reading is 37 volts. The proposed test would aid in determining if this in fact is a fault of the battery or an instrumentation or sensor problem. It has not yet been decided when the test may be held either at LM activation or before. We're at 69 hours 49 minutes GET, and we will shortly be undergoing a shift hand over in Mission Control, and a change of shift news conference will be held between the hours of 12:30 and one o'clock. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
Flight Plan page 3-067
This is Apollo Control at 70 hours 22 minutes. The crew still has a little over 4 and a half hours remaining in this rest period. At the present time we are in the process of completing the shift hand over. Flight director Milton Windler getting briefed by the off going flight director Pete Frank. Windler will shortly be going around the room and checking on the mission status with each of his flight controllers reviewing the status of the mission. At this point, a change of shift news briefing is scheduled to occur in the main auditorium of building 1. As soon as the shift handover is completed, our best estimate on that at the present time would be about 15 minutes. At 1:30 a Skylab Briefing is scheduled. That briefing if the news conference runs long will follow immediately after the change of shift news conference. And it will also be held in the main auditorium of building 1. At the present time we show Apollo 14 traveling at a velocity of 3,366 feet per second [1,026 m/s] and 26,819 nautical miles [49,669 km] from the Moon. At 70 hours, 23 minutes; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
Flight Plan page 3-068
This is Apollo Control at 73 hours 12 minutes. We're still considering the possibility of having the crew reenter the Lunar Module, following their sleep period to run a test on the ascent battery, which is showing, at last check a slightly below normal open circuit voltage. No decision has been made at this time as to whether or not that will be done ahead of the Flight Plan. If it is decided to run the check, it would most likely be performed following the midcourse correction 4 and before the lunar orbit insertion. The midcourse correction 4 is currently scheduled at 77 hours 38 minutes. The maneuver will be performed at this time, anyway, with the SPS, the Service Propulsion System engine. The current velocity change required appears to be about 3.6 feet per second [1.1 m/s]. That could be performed with the service propulsion system using a minimum impulse burn of about .6 of a second. The crew has a little bit more then 1 hour 45 minutes remaining in their rest period. We plan to let them sleep the full time if they so desire. Flight Director Milton Windler checked with the Flight Activities Officer a short while ago to see if it would be possible to extend the sleep period if the crew is still sleeping at the end of the period, and the Flight Activities Officer replied that it would be possible to extend it by as much as about 30 minutes and still not run into any problems getting the midcourse correction performed on time. We have a video tape of last nights television of the Lunar Module housekeeping, which we prepared to replay at this time. The video replay will be in black and white, in order to minimize wear on the tapeheads of the color converter, and we'll play that video tape back at this time.
The "minimum impulse burn" the PAO refers to here is implication on burn time, rather than the thrust provided. Like every other engine in the CSM/LM stack besides the Descent Propulsion System engine in the LM, the Service Propulsion System engine is non-throttleable. It is either on or off and provides a constant amount of thrust.
Flight Plan page 3-069
This is Apollo Control at 74 hours 12 minutes. We now have about 47 minutes remaining in the crew rest period. Around the Flight Director's console, for the past 45 minutes or so, there have been a series of group discussions on the procedures that are being worked out for checking out the LM ascent battery. Flight Director Milton Windler advised the Flight Controllers of the progress of the discussions a short while ago. He said at this time, we still do not have a decision as to whether or not we'll attempt to get into the LM and check out the battery, although he said, we do appear to be moving in that direction. If the crew is advised to enter the LM and run the test on the LM battery, it would be done after midcourse correction 4 which is scheduled to occur at about 77 hours 38 minutes. We would like to have the crew completed with activities in the Lunar Module and back in the Command Module by about 80 hours to allow adequate time for the lunar orbit insertion maneuver, which is scheduled to occur at about 82 hours 38 minutes. At the present time we show Apollo 14 traveling at a velocity of 3,487 feet per second [1,063 m/s]. Now 19,068 nautical miles [35,314 km] from the Moon. At 74 hours 14 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 74 hours, 52 minutes. The Apollo 14 crew is scheduled to end its rest period in about 10 - about 8 minutes from this time. We are prepared to let the crew sleep an additional 30 minutes if they so desire. When the crew is awake we plan to discuss with them procedures for checking out battery 5 in the LM ascent stage and if the crew concurs we will have them re-enter the Lunar Module at about 78 hours to run the test on battery 5. Essentially the way the test is planned is to have the battery 5, which is hooked to the Lunar Module Pilot's bus in the LM, remove from that bus and attach to the Commander's bus where the open circuit voltage can be measured with another sensor. If the sensor on that bus again measures the slight decrease in voltage that was shown on the Lunar Module Pilot bus, that is about 36.7 volts as opposed to 37 volts, the battery will be - the reading will be verified by putting the battery 6 back on the Commander's bus and comparing the reading on that battery and if in fact a difference does exist between the two batteries and battery 5 continues to show a lower reading, it will be tested under load and by putting some equipment on line and we'll be watching to see if the batteries share the load equally and if battery 5 is able to maintain full output or able to hold up to 2 amps of load - under load. This procedure will be discussed with the crew and others and if the crew concurs, the IVT into the LM, the intravehicular transfer to the LM will occur at about 78 hours. At the present time we show Apollo 14 17,671 nautical miles [32,727 km] from the Moon. The spacecraft velocity is 3,518 feet per second [1,072 m/s]. We'll continue to stand by live from this point on for word from the crew that they are up or in the event that we don't hear from them in 5 minutes or so when they are scheduled to awake in about 30 minutes when the Capcom would put in a call. At 74 hours, 56 minutes - 55 minutes; this is Apollo Control, Houston standing by.
This is Apollo Control at 75 hours, 30 minutes. We're nearing the end now of the 30 minute extension to the crew's sleep period and we expect that Capcom, Bruce McCandless will be putting in a call shortly to the crew. At the present time Apollo 14 is 16,433 nautical miles [30,434 km] from the Moon. The spacecraft velocity has increased now to 3,549 feet per second [1,082 m/s].
Our communications engineer reports that we're getting carrier downlink from the spacecraft indicating that the crew is up and about and preparing to give us a call. So we'll continue to stand by for that.
This position in Mission Control is known as INCO. While communication systems were previously the domain of the EECOM engineer, the position was later separated to even out the workload.
075:45:21 McCandless: Apollo 14. Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over. [Long pause.]
075:46:00 McCandless: Apollo 14. Apollo 14, this is Houston. Over. [Long pause.]
075:46:20 Mitchell: Houston, Apollo 14. Good morning. How do you read me?
075:46:24 McCandless: Roger. Good evening, Apollo 14. Loud and clear.
075:46:30 Mitchell: Good morning, Bruce. Do you have a consumables update for me?
075:46:33 McCandless: Roger. Are you ready for it?
075:46:38 Mitchell: Okay. Any time you're ready to give it.
075:46:40 McCandless: Okay. Consumables update ...

Comm break.
075:48:00 Mitchell: Houston, 14. Do you read me?
075:48:03 McCandless: Roger, 14. Reading you loud and clear now. We had another antenna switch. Over.
075:48:10 Mitchell: Roger. I lost you after the first hydrogen tank.
075:48:14 McCandless: Okay. Hydrogen tank 1, 72.4, 72.8; oxygen, 89, 87, 38. Over. [Long pause.]
075:48:33 Mitchell: Roger. I got your [Garbled.]
075:48:40 McCandless: Say again your last, Ed.
075:48:45 Mitchell: Roger. I only got the first oxygen tank. Try me again on 2 and 3.
075:48:49 McCandless: Okay. Tank 2, 87 percent; tank 3, 38 percent. Over.
075:48:59 Mitchell: Roger. I got 75:33; RCS total, 83; quads are 83, 83, 82, 84; hydrogen, 72.4 and 72.8; oxygen, 89, 87, 38. [Long pause.]
075:49:16 McCandless: Roger. Are you all eating breakfast up there now?
075:49:19 Mitchell: Our - We're starting. The cooks are in the kitchen at the moment. Our radiation readings for last night - or rather for this morning are 16045 for Al, 1042 - 01042 for Stu, and 05038 for Ed. [Long pause.]
Breakfast for the crew is mixed fruit, Canadian bacon and applesauce, rehydratable Corn flakes and a pineapple-grapefruit drink. While Al and Ed have opted for black coffee, Stu's morning beverage of choice is cocoa.
075:49:46 McCandless: Roger. 16045 for Al, 01042 for Stu, 05038 for Ed, and how about quantity of sleep? Do you have any comments on that? Over.
075:50:00 Mitchell: Roger. For Al, 6 hours; Stu, 6-1/2; and for Ed, 6-1/2. [Long pause.]
075:50:14 McCandless: Roger, Ed. And Ed, when you - when you all feel prepared, we've got quite an extensive batch of paperwork to pass up to you here.
075:50:29 Mitchell: Okay, Bruce. Stand by 1.
075:50:32 McCandless: Roger.
075:50:36 Mitchell: Is it all going to be associated with the Flight Plan?
075:50:39 McCandless: Well, let's see. We got - we got a comment on the Tephem. We've got a flight-plan update. We've got a docking probe status report. We've got a pericynthion plus 2 abort pad. We will have an LOI abort chart in numbers - criterion update. We'll have some questions for you on the cosmic ray flashes. And when it comes in, we'll have a procedure for you for checking out the ascent stage battery number 5 in the LM. Over. [Long pause.]
075:51:14 McCandless: Also the sports news and commentary on midcourse 4.
075:51:21 Mitchell: Okay. Why don't we get the Flight Plan first, so that we can kind of see where we're going. And then we'll string the others out throughout and after breakfast.
075:51:32 McCandless: Okay. Actually, I think you were looking over my shoulder, because the flight-plan update is about the simplest of the whole bunch. What we're aiming towards here ...
075:51:44 Mitchell: We are looking over your shoulder.
075:51:48 McCandless: (Laughter) What we're aiming towards here is getting you into the LM shortly after midcourse correction 4 - to do a little more systems detective work on ascent battery 5. Make everybody feel a little warmer down here. And, of course, the rest of the LM is still in 4 0 shape. At 76 hours in the Flight Plan, we'd like you to pressurize the LM as required. Over. [Long pause.]
075:52:34 Mitchell: Okay. 76 hours, pressurize the LM as required.
075:52:38 McCandless: Roger. At 77 hours, plus 45 minutes, which is right after midcourse 4, maneuver to Moon-view attitude. And that attitude is presently contained in the Flight Plan at 78 plus 55 and is roll 352, 110, 311. Over. [Long pause.]
075:53:16 Mitchell: Roger. Maneuver to Moon-view attitude, and say again the angles. I understand that's at 77:45, right after midcourse 4.
075:53:24 McCandless: Roger. Angles are 352, 110, 311, and they're currently in the Flight Plan at 78 plus 55. [Long pause.]
075:54:14 McCandless: You still there, Ed?
075:54:22 Mitchell: That's affirmative. Okay, I have moved it from 78:55 to 77:45.
075:54:28 McCandless: Roger. And this is a good attitude for LM communication on Aft Omni. And the procedure that we'll have for you later on will have the S-band up for telemetry but not for voice, so you want to use Aft Omni? At 78 hours, or from 78 hours to 80 hours even, we have blocked out for LM checkout of the ascent batteries so you can plan on IVT to the LM at about 78 hours and be back out by 80. Over. [Long pause.]
075:55:05 Mitchell: Okay. Understand that the attitude we're going to is good for the LM Aft Omni, and we will IVT to the LM at 78 hours for a battery-5 checkout and be back - plan to be hack by 80 hours.
075:55:19 McCandless: Roger. And meanwhile, back in the Command Module, Stu can press on with the rest of the normal Command Module activities, such as the P52 and all that.
075:55:30 Mitchell: Okay. You're going to have some good words on the ascent battery 5 for me, you say, in a little while.
075:55:37 McCandless: Yes, indeed. Joe Engle was just over in the LMS here in Houston running through the thing, and it's a fairly - fairly long procedure as far as handwriting goes, but relatively straightforward, and we'll cover it for you in detail.
075:55:56 Mitchell: Okay.
Joe Engle is the Lunar Module Pilot on the backup crew.
075:56:02 McCandless: Would you like a general breakdown on what we plan to do?
075:56:09 Mitchell: I'll stand by until you're ready to read it out, but maybe you can give me a summary before.
075:56:13 McCandless: Roger. [Long pause.]
075:56:25 Mitchell: Okay. Ready for the next item.
075:56:27 McCandless: Okay. This is the docking probe status summary. The conclusion down here is that, on your final successful attempt, the probe's spring started to compress slightly, followed by capture latch engagement. And the dock latch went barber pole, and then the bottle fired and retraction was normal, although the time was somewhat shorter due to the continued firing of the service module RCS. The talkback operation during initial extension and final docking plus the accelerometer data, the capture latch release mode occurrence during the extensions, all indicated normal extension, capture, and retract sequence. Some consideration was given to the possibility that the RCS thrusting compressed the probe until the docking latches engaged, but this would have required more force than the RCS provides. As we mentioned yesterday, we are still Go for the mission. Over. [Long pause.]
075:57:34 Mitchell: Okay. And I think I'd like to have you repeat that after Al and Stu get on the headsets so that I won't have to write the whole thing down. I think they'd like to hear it.
075:57:43 McCandless: Okay. How about a pericynthion ... [Long pause.]
075:58:24 Mitchell: Go ahead, Bruce.
075:58:26 McCandless: Okay, Ed. We're getting a lot of noise on the downlink right now. Let's stand by until after we shift antennas again.
Comm break.
Flight Plan page 3-070
Astronauts Dick Gordon, Pete Conrad, Joe Engle and Phil Chapman are currently on the CapCom console with CapCom Bruce McCandless. And we're continuing to get quite a bit of noise on the downlink as we - as the spacecraft rotates from one OMNI antenna to the next.
Apollo 12 Commander Pete Conrad and Apollo 12 Command Module Pilot have come to Mission Control, along with Apollo 14's Backup LMP Joe Engle.
Perhaps the least familiar name mentioned here is astronaut Philip "Phil" Chapman, who was the mission scientist for Apollo 14. Born in Australia, the MIT-trained physicist was chosen as a scientist astronaut in 1967. He left NASA in 1972 to pursue other opportunities.
076:00:09 McCandless: Okay, 14. How do you read now?
076:00:15 Mitchell: Loud and clear, now, Bruce. Okay, our status at the moment - we're going to hold the probe report until Al and Stu get on the headsets. Let's press on. What's the next thing you have?
076:00:26 McCandless: Okay. Pericynthion plus 2 abort PAD, standing by; P30. [Long pause.]
The pericynthion plus 2 abort PAD, which McCandless is preparing to read up to the crew is an abort maneuver which would be available to the crew to perform if for some reason they were unable to go into lunar orbit.
076:00:55 McCandless: Are you ready for the P30 pericynthion plus 2, Ed?
076:01:04 Mitchell: Okay. LOI plus 2.
076:01:07 McCandless: Roger. Pericynthion plus 2 abort PAD. SPS/G&N, 63, 300, plus 0.90, minus 0.33; TIG, 084:35:20 ... [Long pause.]
076:01:32 Mitchell: Bruce, hold it a minute. [Long pause.]
076:02:03 Mitchell: Okay. Would you start over again now for me, please?
076:02:06 McCandless: Wilco, Ed. This is a pericynthion plus 2 abort PAD. SPS/G&N, 63,300, plus 0.90, minus 0.33, TIG, 084:35:20.03, minus 0711.5, minus 0053.1, minus 1276.8, roll N/A, 084 pitch, yaw N/A. The rest of the pad is N/A. This is an SPS docked burn and the attitudes are based on the landing site REFSMMAT. Read back. Over.
Comm break.
076:03:25 Mitchell: Okay. It's pericynthion plus 2. SPS/G&N, 63,300, plus 0.90, minus 0.33, 84:35:20.03, minus 0711.5, minus 0053.1, minus 1276.8, roll N/A, pitch 084, yaw N/A, or is that 000. The rest of the pad is N/A. SPS docked, landing site REFSMMAT. Over. [Long pause.]
An interpretation of the PAD follows:
Purpose: This PAD is for a burn made two hours after their closest approach to the lunar surface in case that they are not able to enter lunar orbit. This will abort the mission and place them on an Earth return trajectory that will bring the spacecraft to a well-defined ocean landing site.
System: The burn would be made using the large SPS (Service Propulsion System) engine at the rear of the Service Module, under the control of the Guidance and Navigation system.
CSM Weight (Noun 47): 63,300 pounds (28,712 kg).
Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48): +0.90° and -0.33°. These angles represent an initial direction for the gimbal-mounted engine in order to fire through the predicted centre of mass of the spacecraft. In this very short burn, the spacecraft's control system will not have an opportunity to make any further adjustment.
Time of ignition, TIG (Noun 33): 84 hours, 35 minutes, 20.03 seconds.
Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s): X, -711.5 (-216.9); Y, -53.1 (-16.2); Z, -1,276.8 (-389.2). The change in velocity is resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the local vertical frame of reference.
Spacecraft attitude: Roll, N/A; Pitch, 84°; Yaw, N/A. These attitude angles are given with respect to the orientation of the guidance platform at that time.
Additional notes in the PAD are that the IMU will be aligned to the landing site REFSMMAT and that the burn will be performed while docked with the LM.
The pericynthion plus 2 burn, often known as PC+2 for short, was the contingency burn performed during Apollo 13's lunar flyby to speed up their return to Earth. It was a known contingency maneuver already planned for before 13, and remained in use afterwards.
076:04:07 McCandless: Roger. I now have your midcourse-4 PAD. I - I think you're losing ground on me down here. They seem to be piling up faster than we can get them read up.
076:04:18 Mitchell: Okay. Bruce, on the angles on that one. The roll was N/A, pitch was 84, and yaw was zero. Is that correct?
076:04:25 McCandless: Yaw was N/A. Actually, if you want the numbers, roll would be 356 and yaw would be 009. We understood there was a previous agreement that you were just going to use pitch for checking, and you would take the roll and yaw as computed by P40. Over. [Long pause.]
076:04:51 Mitchell: Okay. All right, press on.
076:05:00 McCandless: Okay. Let me hold off on this midcourse-4 pad a minute. I can give you just a second's worth of discussion on the thing. It's coming out to 3.8 feet per second, and this is very close to your SPS minimum impulse. It'll be 0.69 seconds of burn time compared to your guaranteed 0.50 min impulse, and when you get down to Delta-Vc the value of 2/10ths is what they want set in the counter. Over. [Long pause.]
076:05:43 Mitchell: Okay. Understand that.
076:05:52 McCandless: Okay. Midcourse correction number 4. SPS/G&N, 63,375, plus 0.90, minus 0.33, TIG, 077:38:13.98, minus 0001.6, minus 0002.8, plus 0002.1; roll 011, 249, 325, Noun 44 N/A, Delta-VT 0003.8, 0:01, 0000.2, sextant star 01, 173.2, 33.5, GDC Align Sirius and Rigel; 230, 170, 002, no ullage; High-Gain Antenna angles, Pitch plus 32, Yaw 290, Narrow Beam, Automatic mode. Read back. Over.
Comm break.
076:07:44 Mitchell: MCC-4, SPS/G&N, 63,375, plus 0.90, minus 0.33, and 077:38:13.98, minus 0001.6, minus 0002.8, plus 0002.1; plus - or rather 011, 249, 325, Noun 44 N/A, 0003.8, 0:01, 0000.2, 01, 173.2, 33.5, Sirius, Rigel at 230, 170, 002, no ullage, High Gain Antenna angles, Pitch plus 32, Yaw 290; you want it on Narrow and Auto. [Long pause.]
An interpretation of the PAD follows:
Purpose: This PAD details the burn required to maintain the accuracy of their approach to the Moon. It is to be carried out at the fourth planned opportunity for a midcourse correction.
System: The burn would be made using the large SPS (Service Propulsion System) engine at the rear of the Service Module, under the control of the Guidance and Navigation system.
CSM weight (Noun 47): 63,375 pounds (28,746 kg).
Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48): +0.90° and -0.33°. These angles represent an initial direction for the gimbal-mounted engine in order to fire through the predicted centre of mass of the spacecraft. In this very short burn, the spacecraft's control system will not have an opportunity to make any further adjustment.
Time of ignition, TIG (Noun 33): 77 hours, 38 minutes, 13.98 seconds.
Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s): X, -1.6 (-0.5); Y, -2.8 (-0.9); Z, +2.1 (+0.6). These velocity components are expressed with respect to the local vertical frame of reference (that is, with respect to the horizontal plane of the Moon directly beneath them and their orbital path).
Spacecraft attitude: Roll, 11°; Pitch, 249°; Yaw, 325°. The attitude figure is with respect to the IMU orientation at the time of the burn.
HA and HP (Noun 44): These are the expected high and low points of the resulting orbit but in this case, the items are not applicable.
Delta-VT: 3.8 fps (1.2 m/s). This is the total change in velocity the spacecraft would experience and is a vector sum of the three components given above.
Burn duration or burn time: 0.1 second. Although the command for the burn will be very short, the tail-off thrust will account for a large part of the Delta-V.
Delta-VC: 0.2 fps. Using its ability to independently measure acceleration, the EMS can shut down the engine in case the G&N system fails to do so. This figure, Delta-VC, is entered into the EMS's Delta-V counter (hence Delta-VC) and the value is lower than Delta-VT because the EMS does not take account of the engine's tail-off thrust.
Sextant star: Star 01 (Alpheratz, Alpha Andromedae) visible in sextant when shaft and trunnion angles are 173.2° and 33.5° respectively. This is part of an attitude check prior to the burn.
Boresight star: This is a second attitude check which is made by sighting on another celestial object with the COAS (Crew Optical Alignment Sight). The technique will not be used on this occasion.
GDC Align stars: Stars Vega (number 36) and Deneb (number 43) to be used for backup GDC Align. As well as the IMU, two gyro assemblies associated with the GDC (Gyro Display Coupler) are available for attitude determination. These are normally aligned to match the IMU but in case this cannot be achieved, the crew have a backup method of aligning them. They would aim the scanning telescope at two stars, adjusting the attitude of the entire spacecraft until the stars are aligned with the telescope's reticle in a certain way. This places the spacecraft in a known orientation and its offset from the desired REFSMMAT can be dialled in.
GDC Align angles: X, 230°; Y, 170°; Z, 2°. These are the angles that would represent the spacecraft's orientation during a backup GDC Align operation.
Additional notes in the PAD are that no ullage will be performed, and instructions are given for using the High Gain Antenna during the burn.
076:08:49 McCandless: 14, Houston. Readback correct.
Comm break.
076:10:41 Mitchell: Houston, 14. How do you read now?
076:10:48 McCandless: Okay. When you have a chance we'd like P00 and Accept Ed. And we'll uplink you the midcourse-4 target load and a new state vector. Over. [Long pause.]
076:11:23 Mitchell: Okay, Bruce. You have P00 and Accept.
076:11:29 McCandless: Okay, Ed. You may recall our discussion on Tephem last evening, with regard to the sign of the quantity in R3. We've had a request down here that you, on the CMC and LGC, load in the Tephem from the pad that we passed you. That is the - the quantity using all positive signs. Do you still have that handy? [Long pause.]
076:12:01 Mitchell: Let me double check. [Long pause.]
076:12:27 Mitchell: Roger. Those are the numbers 00006, 39223, and 16020. Is that affirmative?
076:12:35 McCandless: Roger, that's the one.
076:12:39 Mitchell: Okay, we'll load these in after while.
076:12:42 McCandless: Let us finish with the uplink first. [Long pause.]
076:12:57 McCandless: Okay, Ed. We have a - a rather detailed change to the LOI Mode I DPS abort chart and numerical data. This is found in the Flight Plan in the Contingency Checklist, and the numerical stuff is on one of your cue cards. It'd probably be easiest if you broke out the Flight Plan, say, and went through it with me. [Long pause.]
076:13:30 Mitchell: Okay. Did you get my readback on the midcourse-4 PAD
076:13:42 McCandless: Uh ...
076:13:49 Mitchell: It sounded to me like you dropped out before I finished reading it back. [Long pause.]
076:14:04 McCandless: Yes. As far as - as far as I can tell, I got all of it. I recall definitely down through Sirius and Rigel, and I believe I recall your reading the High-Gain Antenna angles back, and I got - so I'll Roger for that.
076:14:20 Mitchell: Okay, thank you. [Long pause.]
076:15:00 Mitchell: Okay, Bruce. Give me a few words on the DPS abort changes before we start giving the actual numbers.
076:15:11 McCandless: Okay, you have a change in the DPS Delta-V available line due to a different engine model, change in the spacecraft weight, and a change in the usable propellant from the time that this curve was calculated. You have a change in the two other lines, which are the LOI plus 2-hour and LOI plus 30-minute abort Delta-V based on the change in your orbit from the nominal plan. This all backs up to the 40-minute-late lift-off. And the numerical changes are a consequence of that, also. Over. [Long pause.]
076:15:56 Mitchell: Okay. Let's start through them slowly then and see if we can correct them.
076:16:02 McCandless: Okay.
076:16:08 McCandless: Over here in the DPS Delta-V available line, the left-hand intercept is at abort Delta-V of 1966 feet per second at LOI Delta-V of zero. The right-hand intercept on the vertical dashed line comes at an abort Delta-V of 2130 and the LOI Delta-V of 725. Then connect the two intercepts together with a straight line. Over. [Long pause.]
076:16:51 Mitchell: Okay. Stand by. The first one is 1966. Let's just take them one at a time, and I'll plot them.
076:16:57 McCandless: Roger. [Long pause.]
076:17:08 Mitchell: And you say the - the right-hand intercept is 21 what ?
076:17:14 McCandless: Is 2130, 2130, and it falls on that vertical dashed line at 725. It separates Mode I from Mode II.
076:17:27 Mitchell: I got it.
076:17:29 McCandless: Okay, connect them up.
076:17:37 McCandless: 14, Houston. The computer's yours. [Long pause.]
076:17:49 Mitchell: Okay, I'm in Block. Give me the next line now.
076:17:54 McCandless: Roger. In the LOI plus 2-hour abort Delta-V region, the left-hand intercept is at 1477 feet per second. Over. [Long pause.]
076:18:13 Mitchell: Copy, 1477.
076:18:16 McCandless: Roger. And the right-hand end point is at 2026 abort Delta-V, and LOI Delta-V of 238. It should intercept your DPS Delta-V available line where it crosses the boundary between the Mode I 2 hour and the Mode I 30 minutes. Over. [Long pause.]
076:18:41 Mitchell: Roger. Took care of that, and let me draw that one.
076:18:51 McCandless: Okay. You ready for the next one?
076:19:02 Mitchell: Okay. Ready for the next one.
076:19:04 McCandless: Okay. Over in the LOI plus 30-minute abort region, the left-hand intercept, with the boundary between Mode I 2 hour and Mode I 30 minutes, occurs at abort Delta-V of 1517 and LOI Delta-V of 238. Over.
076:19:23 McCandless: And we're going down in the mud again, Ed. I'm going to wait for the antenna changeover before we continue with that one.
076:19:34 Mitchell: Okay. I've got you at 1517 for the first one.
Comm break.
076:22:04 McCandless: Okay, 14, Houston. We're coming back in now. I confirm 1517 for the left-hand edge, and the righthand intercept is at abort Delta-V of 2395 on the 725 Delta-V magnitude dashed line. Over. [Long pause.]
076:22:27 Mitchell: 2375. Is that correct?
076:22:30 McCandless: Negative. 2395. Over.
076:22:35 Mitchell: Okay. 2395. [Long pause.]
076:23:29 Mitchell: Okay, Bruce. Have that line plotted.
076:23:32 McCandless: Okay. And all three of those lines ought to be pretty close to parallel to the existing lines; you concur?
076:23:40 Mitchell: Yes, they sure are.
076:23:44 McCandless: Okay. Over to the numerical data. Come on over to the - the little block there and, on the second line down under burn time starting out with 0 plus 33, Mode I, loose, it should be zero plus 33 through 1 plus 19, and Delta-VM is 238 through 570. Over. [Long pause.]
076:24:27 Mitchell: Okay. The burn - the burn - burn time from 033 to 115 should be 033 to 119, and the corresponding Delta-VM is 238 to 570.
076:24:43 McCandless: Roger. Next line down. The burn time is 1 plus 19 through 1 plus 40, and the burn time is - or the Delta-V M is 570 through 725. Over. [Long pause.]
076:25:05 Mitchell: Okay. We change from 119 to 140 and Delta-VM is 570 to 725.
076:25:14 McCandless: Roger. On the next line down, you change 1 plus 39 to 1 plus 40, so it reads 1 plus 40 through 2 plus 41. Over.
076:25:26 Mitchell: Okay. One - The next line is 140 to 241.
076:25:30 McCandless: Okay, now down below it, you've got a column for updated times. And I'll read you the updated times.
076:25:41 Mitchell: Okay.
076:25:44 McCandless: Okay. GET of LOI ignition: 82 plus 36 plus 47, 83 plus 06 plus 47; roll: 127, 264, 348; CSM IMU angles GET abort ignition, 84 plus 36 plus 47. The next block down under LM FDAI angles, the TIG: 84 plus 36 plus 47; 170, 261, 000. [Long pause.]
076:26:50 Mitchell: Okay. And Bruce, the only time I think I've missed is the CSM IMU angles at LOI plus 30.
076:26:59 McCandless: Okay. 83 plus 06 plus 47. Over. [Long pause.]
076:27:12 Mitchell: Okay. I read back GET and LOI ignition update is 82:37:47; the LOI plus 30 is 83:06:47; CSM IMU angle for LOI plus 2 is for a time of 84:36:47; and the LM angles for that time are - the LM FDAI angles for that time are 80 - 84:36:47; and they're 170, 261, 000. [Long pause.]
076:27:49 McCandless: Okay, Ed. The readback is correct except that you omitted the roll, pitch, and yaw angles under CSM IMU angles for LOI plus 30.
076:28:04 Mitchell: Roger. I didn't hear them. Are they - they the same?
076:28:07 McCandless: Okay. Roll and yaw are the same. Pitch has changed from 263 to 264. Over. [Long pause.]
076:28:23 Mitchell: Oh, those. Okay, I thought I read them to you, Bruce. I have them: 127, 264, and 348.
076:28:30 McCandless: Roger. Readback is correct, and we've got some news whenever you're ready.
076:28:37 Mitchell: Okay. Let's hold off and let the other guys get on the headsets and have some news, while I get some breakfast.
076:28:45 McCandless: Okay, and those changes need to be made in the Contingency Checklist, the Flight Plan, and on your cue card.
076:28:55 Mitchell: Roger. We'll do it.
Very long comm break.
