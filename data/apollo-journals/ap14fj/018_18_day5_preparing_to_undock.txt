Lunar Module Antares has come alive per the Flight Plan with Al Shepard and Ed Mitchell at the helm. The crew's greatest concern at the moment is whether the previously problematic docking system will give them a trouble-free release of the LM from the Command Module mothership.
Editor's note: All transcript times are presented according to the GET update at 054:53:36 that saw the mission timer moved forward 40 minutes, 2.90 seconds.

103:17:11 Roosa: No, you can go ahead and close your hatch.
103:17:16 Mitchell: Okay, proceeding.
Long comm break.
103:22:09 Haise: Antares, Houston. The computer is yours.
103:22:13 Mitchell: Okay, thank you.
103:22:24 Haise: Antares, Houston.
103:22:29 Mitchell: Go ahead, Houston.
103:22:30 Haise: Okay. With your meter problem there on the S-band, Ed, that you might change your LOS procedure to go on Pitch, 90; Yaw, 0; and Slew.
103:22:44 Mitchell: Okay. I'll do that Freddo. And I just now noticed the meter is back with me again, but I suspect it's not very reliable.
103:22:51 Haise: Okay.
Comm break.
103:24:07 Mitchell: Houston. We had a Program Alarm 1106 noted.
103:24:17 Haise: Okay, Ed. We saw it here, and you can press on.
Comm break.
103:28:24 Roosa: Okay, Al. Would you verify your hatch is closed and the Dump Valve, Auto.
103:28:31 Shepard: Verified.
103:28:37 Roosa: Okay. I've got the - all 12 latches released and the hatch in. And I'm proceeding to vent down the tunnel.
103:28:47 Shepard: Good show.
Comm break.
103:30:18 Mitchell: Houston, Antares.
103:30:19 Haise: Antares, Houston. I've got an AGS K factor for you.
103:30:24 Mitchell: Go.
103:30:26 Haise: Okay. It's plus 00100, plus all zips, plus 00072.
103:30:41 Mitchell: Understand. 100, all zeros, 00072.
103:30:46 Haise: That's correct, Ed. Seven-tenths of a second.
103:30:52 Mitchell: Do you have a - an LOS PAD for me, Freddo?'
103:30:58 Haise: Okay. I'm showing LOS in about 8 seconds.
103:31:06 Mitchell: Thank you.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal. Apollo 14 is nearing the end of its 11th lunar revolution. We're now in 103 hours 31 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. As Apollo 14 came out from behind the Moon earlier in this revolution the landing crew, Shepard and Mitchell were in the Lunar Module beginning to power up the systems. They encountered some problem in locking up with the sterrable antenna of the Lunar Module but this was sorted out later. Apparently there was a malfunction in one of the needles (ir indicators that showed antenna orientation. In the checkout of the ascent battery, storage batteries, battery 5 was reported by Mitchell to be in the same shape it was in the test late last night prior to the time it went into lunar orbit. The open circuit voltage of battery 5 was still hanging in at 36.7 volts and again the loads were cycled on this battery and its sister battery number 6 of up to fairly high averages, shared the load quite well when the load was split and the voltage was dropped down to around 29½ or 30 volts when the full load was applied on it alone with battery 6 turned off. Landing gear was deployed at 102:59 Ground Elapsed Time and the hatch was closed just prior to LOS, the Lunar Module hatch that is, at about 103 hours 17 minutes. There was brief mention in the program alarm during the time that a load was being sent up by a command into the Lunar Module computer. It was program alarm 1106 which turns out to be uplink too fast. In other words the, ail the numbers were being pumped in at too high a rate for the computer to digest. We have acquisition again on Apollo 14 in the 12th revolution in 45 minutes 28 seconds from now. Some of the significant items during that revolution will be of course undocking and separation at about 104:27, throttle check for the descent propulsion system, some photography of the undocking of course, which is sort of standard operating procedure, calibration of the landing point designator which is a grid system in the commanders window in the Lunar Module, calibration of the abort guidance system, command service module circularization maneuver at 105 hours 46 minutes. The LM will maneuver to observe this and photograph it with a 16 millimeter camera, however this will be on the back side, in other words after the next front side pass. At 103 hours 35 minutes Ground Elapsed Time this is Apollo Control.
103:35:47 Mitchell (onboard): How you doing over there, Stu?
103:35:50 Roosa (onboard): Okay.
103:36:15 Mitchell (onboard): Hello, Stu. How do you read?
103:36:17 Roosa (onboard): Loud and clear.
103:36:18 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. Are you recording E-data on this pass?
103:36:23 Roosa (onboard): That's affirmative.
103:36:24 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
103:36:28 Shepard (onboard): How you doing over there, Stu?
103:36:29 Roosa (onboard): Okay. I got a little behind on my suit check. I left these other suit hoses on FLOW instead of Off, and - so that kicked me a little behind by the time I psyched that out, but I?m about to catch up.
103:36:46 Mitchell (onboard): Okay - -
103:36:47 Shepard (onboard): It looks like we're back on the time line ourselves We're going to proceed with our PGA integrity check now.
103:42:18 Mitchell (onboard): ... check the tunnel ... - -
103:42:19 Shepard (onboard): Stu, has the tunnel been vented?
103:42:23 Roosa (onboard): It's been at greater than 3.5 pounds, and I don't have my roll back on yet. It passed the check. I'm just getting my gloves off now. I'll get my roll jets on, and I'll trim you up to the AGS CAL.
103:42:41 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.' We not - we're not quite there yet. Thank you.
103:42:45 Shepard (onboard): We're ahead of the timeline, Stu, so there's no hurry.
103:46:05 Roosa (onboard): Hey, are you firing jets up there?
103:46:08 Shepard (onboard): No, we just dumped a little of the cabin to check the suit valves - is probably what we pushed you - what gave you a little push.
103:46:22 Roosa (onboard): Okay. Man,, that went good.
103:46:35 Shepard (onboard): How about that, babe? I guess maybe they didn't make allowance for that in computing your - How goes it?
103:46:43 Roosa (onboard): Yes. They ought to have a call for me to go Free or something there.
103:47:34 Roosa (onboard): Okay, I'm going to trim you up for the AGS CAL.
103:47:37 Shepard (onboard): Okay. Good.
103:48:25 Mitchell (onboard): You know, Stu, on that DEPRESS firing, I guess there's nothing we can do except squirt a little bit out, and you'll have to stop it. It costs you fuel, under any circumstances, I guess.
103:48:35 Roosa (onboard): Yes, but see, I have to start a maneuver back to the AGS CAL attitude anyway. So - But no sweat. I'm going to - I'll go - -
103:48:47 Shepard (onboard): How are you doing on the fuel? How goes it ... anyway?
103:48:52 Roosa (onboard): I didn't have time to plot it.
103:51:38 Mitchell (onboard): Stuart, when you're through with your maneuver, let me know, please, and I'll go ahead with my check.
103:51:45 Roosa (onboard): Okay.
103:55:32 Roosa (onboard): Okay, Ed, I'm here. But we ought to wait a minute or 2 here to make sure the rates are damped.
103:55:38 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. This test is pretty gross, so it doesn't really hurt anything. This is for my rate gyros.
103:55:50 Roosa (onboard): Okay. All the rates are pretty well damped.
103:55:55 Mitchell (onboard): Thank you.
103:57:44 Shepard (onboard): Okay, Stu, you ready for a snapshot on the Noun 20?
103:57:40 Roosa (onboard): Okay. Get a Verb 06 55 up. I - I mean a Noun -Verb 06 Noun 20.
103:57:57 Shepard (onboard): Okay.
103:57:59 Roosa (onboard): Verb ... Verb 06 Noun 20, and I'm ready to ...
103:58:10 Shepard (onboard): One -
103:58:11 Shepard (onboard): MARK.
103:58:12 Roosa (onboard): Hey, give me another mark on that, Al.
103:58:19 Shepard (onboard): Okay. Verb 06 Noun 20. Stand by, 3, 2, 1 -
103:58:28 Shepard (onboard): MARK.
103:58:29 Roosa (onboard): Okay, on your mark, I read plus 00, plus 69, plus 11304, plus 02288.
103:58:45 Shepard (onboard): Okay. I had as a GET 103:58:25, 00769 - That's a good one - 11304, 02288.
103:59:01 Roosa (onboard): That's affirmative.
103:59:02 Shepard (onboard): Okay.

104:00:23 Roosa (onboard): Okay, I just switched comm on ... How do you read?
104:00:26 Shepard (onboard): Beautiful. Loud and clear.
104:00:30 Roosa (onboard): Okay.
104:01:09 Shepard (onboard): Okay, Stu, could you verify that you have a 3-3 thruster, off, o-f-f? Radar Transponder, Off, O-F-F.
104:01:17 Roosa (onboard): Verify the transponder is off, and ...
104:01:23 Shepard (onboard): Okay.
104:01:24 Roosa (onboard): And verify G&C thruster 3 is off.
104:01:27 Shepard (onboard): Good show. I'm going with the rendezvous radar check. Be back with you momentarily.
104:02:26 Mitchell (onboard): Stu. I'm ready to start my AGS CAL.
104:02:39 Roosa (onboard): Okay. The rates are damped, and I'm going CMC, Free, now.
104:02:43 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
104:04:04 Mitchell (onboard): Okay. You say you're CMC, Free, now. Is that affirmative?
104:09:33 Mitchell (onboard): Stu, you can enable all thrusters, except B-3.
104:12:01 Roosa (onboard): Say, Al, how much longer do you think it'll be before I can get B-3 out?
104:12:06 Shepard (onboard): Just a minute.
104:13:35 Mitchell (onboard): It'll take about 2 more minutes, Stu.
104:15:04 Mitchell (onboard): Okay, Stu, you can enable B-3-
104:15:10 Roosa (onboard): And can I turn my transponder off?
104:15:14 Mitchell (onboard): Roger; that's affirmative.
104:15:15 Shepard (onboard): Affirmative.
104:16:03 Roosa (onboard): Okay. Are we going to start a maneuver?
104:16:05 Shepard (onboard): Okay.
104:16:06 Mitchell (onboard): Okay.
This is Apollo Control 104 hours 18 minutes Ground Elapsed Time about a minute out from acquisition of Apollo 14 coming around from behind the Moon on the 12th lunar revolution. Flight Director Gerry Griffin has asked all the flight controllers in the room to go amber on his status board and his particular console and as they give him the go for undocking they will punch up green. 28 seconds to acquisition, we should be getting an indication before too many more seconds of incoming telemetry. That's usually the first thing the network advises the flight director that we have telemetry. We're standing by and should come any moment now. At AOS CSM.
104:19:58 Roosa: Hello, Houston. Do you read Kitty Hawk?
104:20:01 Haise: Kitty Hawk. Read you loud and clear.
104:20:06 Roosa (onboard): Okay.... standing by for a Go for Sep.
104:20:07 Roosa: Okay. Like we're standing by for a Go for Sep.
104:20:15 Haise: Roger, Kitty Hawk.
104:21:06 Haise: Antares, Houston. Are you online?
104:21:15 Roosa: Antares. Do you have lockup for Houston?
104:21:18 Mitchell: Roger; stand by. Okay, Houston. You're locked up.
104:21:29 Haise: Roger, Antares. We would like High Bit Rate.
104:21:36 Mitchell: And you have it.
104:23:18 Haise: Antares, Houston. Could you try the Servo again?
104:23:27 Mitchell: Houston. Let me put you on Omni until we get undocked. I'm damn busy right now.
104:23:35 Haise: Okay, Ed.
104:23:38 Shepard: Okay, Houston. Do you want the - I got the gimbal angles ready for you, if you're ready to copy.
104:23:49 Haise: Okay. Go ahead.
104:23:55 Shepard: Okay. On that drift check, I got a GET of 103:58:25; Command Module as follows: 007.69, 113.04, 022.88. Are you with me?
104:24:13 Haise: Roger, Al.
104:24:17 Shepard: Okay. LM as follows 293.39, 293-05, 337-09.
104:24:28 Haise: Okay. CSM, 007.69, 113-04, 022.88; LM, 293.39, 293.05, 337.09; and a GET of 103:58:25.
104:24:51 Shepard: Okay.
104:25:01 Haise: Kitty Hawk and Antares , you have a Go for undock.
104:25:09 Mitchell: Okay.
104:25:10 Roosa: Kitty Hawk; Roger.
104:25:12 Haise: Okay. And I'd just like to reiterate some words I think you got passed from Bruce earlier. If the nominal undock does not take place after you get things damped out again, we need 5 seconds of minus-X thrusted by both vehicles. And Kitty Hawk should call the thrusting on and off.
104:25:40 Roosa: Okay. You want 5 seconds. We were told 3 before, but - Okay, we want each one a minus 5 seconds while I'm holding the switch.
104:25:51 Haise: That's affirmative, Stu. And you should call the on and off command.
104:25:58 Roosa: Okay. I'm going to try the nominal first.
104:26:01 Haise: That's affirmative.
104:26:04 Roosa: And we're free.
104:26:18 Roosa: Okay. Antares, how do you read on VOX?
104:26:21 Haise: Loud and clear.
104:26:23 Mitchell: Okay, loud and clear.
104:26:24 Shepard: Loud and clear.
104:26:26 Roosa: Okay.
104:26:28 Mitchell: Okay. Tape Recorder's, On, S-Band. What's that? Houston, I have you locked up on the steerable.
104:26:53 Haise: Roger, Ed.
104:27:02 Shepard: Okay, let me keep you on it now.
104:27:07 Roosa: Okay.
104:27:15 Shepard: Got to keep the - hold off on it until you do.
104:27:19 Mitchell: Give me about 5 seconds, Stu. Need another 5 seconds.
104:27:23 Roosa: Okay. I'm showing 10. We'll make it 15.
104:27:27 Mitchell: Okay. Good.
104:27:30 Shepard: Give me Biomed, Left; PCM, Hi.
104:27:34 Roosa: Okay. They're zero. Will you be ready to go at 5? Are you ready, Al?
104:27:40 Shepard: Okay. We're ready.
104:27:41 Mitchell: Go.
104:27:42 Shepard: We're ready, go.
104:27:44 Roosa: Okay. Okay, you're moving out - -
104:27:48 Shepard-LM: We're clear - -
104:27:49 Roosa: - - and you're hanging on the end of the probe. We'll wait until motions damp here. Okay, we seem real steady. I'm going to back off from you.
104:28:03 Shepard-LM: Okay.
104:28:06 Mitchell-LM: Beautiful.
104:28:07 Shepard-LM: Very good.
104:28:15 Roosa: Okay, we had a normal undocking, Houston.
104:28:23 Shepard-LM: Okay. Deadband Min; Verb 77; go to P00.
104:28:45 Shepard-LM: Okay. Yaw left 60, pitch up 90.
104:28:49 Mitchell-LM: Okay, starting left yaw, Stu.
104:28:51 Roosa: Okay. Boy , you look mighty pretty out there.
104:29:00 Mitchell-LM: And starting the pitchup.
104:29:09 Shepard-LM: Yaw right 60, yaw left 60, pitch up 90.
104:29:14 Haise: And, Antares; Houston. We've lost data on you now. We'd like your - what you ended up with in Noun 83.
104:29:26 Mitchell-LM: Roger. We ended up with 1 - plus 0.1, minus point - minus 0.1, plus 0.1, and 0.
104:29:39 Haise: Roger, Ed.
104:29:41 Mitchell-LM: Houston, you reading? Minus 0.1, minus 0.1, and 0.
104:29:46 Haise: Okay. Minus 0.1, minus 0.1, and 0.

104:30:09 Mitchell-LM: Houston. I have you back on the Omnis. It doesn't seem to be tracking.
104:30:14 Haise: Roger, Antares.
104:30:23 Mitchell-LM: I'll give you Low bit rate, if you want it.
104:30:34 Haise: Okay, Antares. You can stay in Hi.
104:30:39 Mitchell-LM: Roger.
104:31:05 Roosa: Okay, Al. You're around - you want me to verify your tracker light? And it's loud and clear.
104:31:22 Shepard-LM: Okay, Stu. We have you and have the camera on, and you look mighty pretty out there.
104:31:27 Roosa: Yes. I've been taking a few shots of you there. Pretty impressive. Okay, DAC going Off.
104:32:28 Haise: And, Kitty Hawk; Houston. BMAG is rate 2.
104:32:35 Roosa: Roger.
104:33:03 Mitchell-LM: Houston, Antares. You're back on the steerable.
104:33:06 Haise: Roger, Antares. And I got a REV 12 TCA for you.
104:33:14 Mitchell-LM: Roger. Stand by 1.
104:34:25 Mitchell-LM: Houston, Antares. I'd like to recheck those gimbal angles with you again, please.
104:34:31 Haise: Okay. Go ahead, Antares.
104:34:37 Mitchell-LM: I'm little bit rushed here. Let me just give you the Command Module and LM angles again. Command module, 007.69, 113.04, 022.88; and'LM, I had 293.39, 293.05, 337.09.
104:35:04 Haise: Okay, Antares. I copied Command Module: ' 007.69, 113.04, 022.88; LM: 293.39, 293.05, 337-09; and the GET was 104:38:25.
104:35:31 Mitchell-LM: That's correct, Fred. Thank you.
104:35:35 Shepard-LM: Fred, I'm ready for the ... - REV 12 TCA.
104:35:54 Haise: And, Antares; Houston. The TCA was 104:59:38. And we'd like to get the steerable again; Pitch, plus 66; Yaw, minus 43.
104:36:26 Mitchell-LM: Okay, Freddo. You have the steerable again. Be advised, it seems to track for a few minutes, and then breaks lock, and then heads for the stop.
104:36:34 Haise: Roger, Ed. The last loss there was due to a problem we had on the site on the ground here.
104:36:44 Mitchell-LM: Okay.
104:36:50 Haise: And, Antares, did you copy the TCA time?
104:36:56 Shepard-LM: Roger. 104:59:38.
104:36:59 Haise: Very good.
104:37:38 Haise: Kitty Hawk, Houston. Omni Alpha.
104:37:49 Roosa: Okay. You got Omni Alpha, Houston.
104:37:53 Haise: Roger, Stu.
104:40:04 Mitchell-LM: Houston, Antares. We'll proceed with the DPS throttle check, if you're ready.
104:40:17 Haise: Roger, Antares. That'll be all right, and, if you give us P00 and Data, we'll pump you up a Command Module state vector.
104:40:28 Mitchell-LM: You have it, and we're proceeding with the throttle check.
104:40:32 Haise: Roger.
104:40:56 Mitchell-LM: Okay. Engine Stop, push. We have a light.
104:41:14 Mitchell-LM: Okay, Houston. Engine is armed, and we go with the Commander's Min, soft stop; Max; back to Min. Here we go with the LMP. It's in Min, soft stop; and going to MAX.
104:42:14 Haise: Antares, the throttle check looks good.
104:42:19 Mitchell-LM: Okay; Arm, Off.
104:42:25 Haise: Antares, Houston. The computer is yours.
104:42:31 Mitchell-LM: Okay. Thank you.
104:43:07 Haise: And, Antares; Houston. You can proceed on by the program alarm.
104:43:14 Mitchell-LM: Okay , thank you.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. Presently under way onboard Antares is descent propulsion system throttle check. There was considerable jubilation here in the mission control room when the successful undocking was accomplished. In the room are the backup Apollo 14 crewmen, Gene Cernan, Ron Evans and Joe Engle, and Apollo 15 Commander, Dave Scott. Others in the room include Apollo program director, Rocco Petrone, Apollo spacecraft manager, Jim McDivitt, and mission director, Chet Lee. We'll continue to monitor air-ground as the crew of Antares continues with the checkout of the propulsion systems onboard the Lunar Module.
104:51:57 Mitchell-M: Houston, Antares.
104:52:01 Haise: Go ahead, Antares.
104:52:06 Mitchell-LM: Roger. We're going over Hipparchus L and Hipparchus C at 8 minutes before the landing site. Looks just like the map.
104:52:16 Haise: Roger, Ed.
104:52:59 Shepard-LM: Okay. We got Albategnius on the left.
104:53:07 Haise: Roger, Al.
104:53:16 Mitchell-LM: We have Hipparchus J on the right as we're going over it. It looks like it's right below us, about 1000 feet. Instead of 40. This is Muller ahead of us, Muller A on the left, Muller 0 first. Hipparchus K out to the right.
104:53:40 Haise: Look's like you're right on the line.
104:53:45 Mitchell-LM: Yes; we sure are.
104:53:56 Mitchell-LM: Fred, I don't see how we could clear that ridge ahead of us; it sticks up so far.
104:54:15 Shepard-LM: Okay, Ptolemaeus A on the left.
104:54:20 Haise: Roger, Al.
104:54:34 Mitchell-LM: We look like we're at about - about a foot above it, and Stu's below us.Here's Herschel out - Herschel out to the right.
104:55:57 Mitchell (onboard): And the camera has started, Freddo, as we crossed Lalande N and NA.
104:55:57 Mitchell-LM: And the camera is started, Freddo, as we cross Lalande N and NA.
104:56:03 Haise: Roger, Ed.
104:56:10 Mitchell-LM: Might even get a picture of Stu ahead of us; we're crossing Lalande C.
104:56:16 Haise: Okay.
104:58:06 Mitchell (onboard): Okay, Freddo. We're coming over Turner Crater. It looks just like on the map as we approach the site
104:58:06 Mitchell-LM: Okay, Freddo. We're coming over Turner Crater. Looks just like on the map as we approach the site.
104:58:14 Haise: Roger, Ed.
104:58:30 Haise: Do you have about the same picture with respect to the shadows on those ridges up ahead, Ed, as the map?
104:58:39 Mitchell (onboard): They don't seem quite as long as on the map, Freddo
104:58:39 Mitchell-LM: They don't seem quite as long as on the map, Freddo.
104:58:44 Haise: Okay.
Comm break.

105:00:30 Shepard-LM: Okay, Houston. We've spotted the general area of the landing site from in this area on in. We didn't spot Cone Crater on this pass, however.
105:00:41 Haise: Okay, Al. We'll get a look at it a couple passes later.
105:00:55 Shepard-LM: And, Freddo, as we come up on Lansberg here, it's -the terminator is running right across it. And it was a big one. It really has some - a steep rim -or rather a high rim, very noticeably high rim from here - from here. And it's right - the terminator goes right through it.
Rare signal tuning noises break into the air to ground channel.
105:01:35 Haise: And, Antares, Houston. You can use the same LOS procedures on the steerable.
105:01:44 Shepard-LM: Okay.
105:02:05 Roosa: Okay, Houston. How do you read Kitty Hawk?
105:02:08 Haise: Loud and clear, Kitty Hawk.
105:02:14 Roosa: Okay, that pass went just as advertised. I think we've got plenty of marks on it.
105:02:21 Haise: Very good, Stu.
105:03:01 Roosa: Antares, Kitty Hawk.
105:03:03 Mitchell-LM: Go ahead.
105:03:04 Roosa: Okay. I'm going to be setting up for ranging Simplex B.
105:03:08 Mitchell-LM: Okay, we're right on the time line.
105:03:12 Roosa: Okay.
105:03:36 Haise: Kitty Hawk, Houston.
105:03:37 Roosa: Say again, Ed. Go ahead, Houston.
105:03:42 Haise: Roger, Kitty Hawk. We'd like to crank up the High Gain. Pitch, minus 87; Yaw, plus 281; Manual and Wide so we can get a tape dump.
105:03:56 Roosa: Okay, minus 87, and say again the Yaw?
105:04:00 Haise: Yaw, plus 281.
105:04:05 Roosa: 281.
105:04:14 Roosa: Okay. I read 0.53. No, make that 0.55; mine keep: varying a little bit.
105:05:37 Mitchell-LM: Okay, Stu. We'll take ...
105:05:47 Roosa: Okay, I'm reading 0.57.
105:05:54 Mitchell-LM: 0.57. Thank you.
105:06:50 Roosa: Okay.
105:07:01 Mitchell-LM: Houston - Houston, Antares.
105:07:04 Haise: Roger, Antares.
105:07:09 Mitchell-LM: My S-Band Antenna circuit breaker has popped twice now. I think that may be the reason we're breaking lock occasionally. We got some problems in it
105:07:18 Haise: Okay, Ed. Is that the AC or, on your side, the DC one?
105:07:24 Mitchell-LM: No, that's the DC one on panel 16.
The steerable antenna requires both DC and AC power from the EPS to drive it, each governed by an independent circuit breaker.
105:07:28 Haise: Okay.
105:07:30 Mitchell-LM: Seems like it might be overheating on us, probably.
Comm break.
105:08:29 Mitchell-LM: Okay, Houston. I'm locked up again. The circuit breaker is holding for the moment.
105:08:33 Haise: Roger, Ed.
Comm break.
105:09:18 Roosa: Houston, Kitty Hawk. Did you get the torquing angles?
105:09:25 Haise: And negative, Kitty Hawk.
105:09:30 Roosa: Okay. Ready to copy?
105:09:32 Haise: Go ahead, Stu.
105:09:40 Roosa: Okay. 000.30, minus 000.38, plus 000.28; torque at 105:08:40.
105:10:00 Haise: Okay, Antares; Houston. We'd like you to back out of that 52. We need to look at a bit here.
