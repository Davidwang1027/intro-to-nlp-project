This is Apollo Control at 202 hours, 55 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 9 at the present time is over China on the 128 revolution. The tracking station at Guam will acquire the spacecraft in about 7 minutes. Previously the tracking sighted Ascension Island - had the spacecraft, and on that particular track there was biomedical information transmitted down from the spacecraft to the ground on the Commander who is now asleep in the left couch, and the Command Module Pilot who is now sleeping in the right couch. According to the Flight Surgeon here at MCC, the data indicated that both astronauts were in the early stages of sleep. The systems on the spacecraft were performing normally, with some 6 hours and 2 minutes still remaining in the sleep period, or the rest period. At 202 hours, 57 minutes; this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 204 hours, 3 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 9, at the present time is just moving out of range of the Ascension tracking station. During its pass over the Ascension station, the Surgeon here reported that the two astronauts on which we have biomedical information, namely Dave Scott and Jim McDivitt, appear to be sleeping rather soundly, and the indications are that they have been asleep now or at least resting well and asleep lightly for the last couple of hours. The spacecraft systems all seem to be functioning normally. On this the 129 revolution, the spacecraft will be moving over the west coast of Africa shortly. There are about 5 hours left in the rest cycle, Guam will be the next to acquire and that should be something on the order of 33 minutes from now. All systems are apparently functioning normally. At 204 hours, 4 minutes GET; this is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 204 hours, 53 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Spacecraft at this time is just moving out of range of the tracking ship Huntsville, on this the 129 revolution. There is an increasing level of activity here in Mission Control as the Orange Team moves in to replace the Gold Team. Flight Director for the oncoming shift is Pete Frank. The doctor reported that the astronauts are still sleeping soundly on this last pass, and the information that was downlinked from the spacecraft indicated the systems were functioning normally and well.
This is Apollo Control; 205 hours, 50 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 9, just at the beginning of the 130th revolution, about one-quarter through that revolution, is presently ever the Nile Delta in Egypt. The crew is still asleep. All systems are functioning normally on the spacecraft according to the telemetry read-outs on the ground. The spacecraft next will be acquired by the tracking station at Guam at 14 minutes past the hour; and at 205 hours, 51 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control; 206 hours, 50 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 9 presently is over the South Pacific, nearing the end of the 130th revolution. The crew is still asleep at this time. The spacecraft analysis report is coming out of the back room of the Mission Control Center here on systems performance. The reports are getting shorter each issue. The general run of the comments are "All Systems nominal." The next station to acquire Apollo 9 will be the Canary Islands station at 10 minutes past the hour. And at 206 hours, 51 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control; 207 hours, 50 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 9 presently is midway through the 131st revolution and is just clearing the east coast of the island of Borneo, will come up on the tracking ship Hunts - as you were, on the tracking station at Honeysuckle, Australia at 7 - in 7 minutes from this point followed by a pass over Mercury of about 9 minutes duration. The crew is still asleep at this time; it is anticipated they will be awakened at about 4 am Central Standard Time. The spacecraft continues to perform exceptionally well with no even minor problems at this time. And at 207 hours, 51 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
208:49:24 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston.
208:49:30 Scott: Hello, Houston, Apollo 9.
208:49:32 Roosa: Boy, Dave, you sure do wake up in a hurry. I never have to call you more than once
208:49:39 Scott: Well, we're expecting you every morning.
208:49:42 Roosa: Well, good morning and all that good jazz. We'll have to think up something jazzy to wake you up with tomorrow.
This is Apollo Control. Let's join the conversation in progress.
208:49:56 Roosa: Hey, I've got a question here for you.
208:50:01 Scott: Go ahead.
208:50:04 Scott: Go ahead, Houston.
208:50:06 Roosa: Okay. You're over the Canaries now. When you come across Australia, you're going to hit it with a - it's going to be almost sunset, but almost enough light for a picture. I was wondering if you could get a picture. It's generally dark down there, and we don't get many chances. This gives you about 30 minutes to get ready for it.
208:50:37 Scott: Roger, Houston. We'll do that.
208:50:40 Roosa: Okay, If you've got something to write on now, I'll give you a time.
208:50:44 Scott: Okay. Go ahead.
208:50:47 Roosa: 209 plus 27 plus 11, four frames, 10 second exposures shooting on the nadir. You're shooting on the nadir. You're shooting the west coast of Australia - and it's for geology and oceanography.
208:51:10 Scott: Okay. 209:27:11, four frames, 10 second intervals, on the nadir. We can get that one.
208:51:19 Roosa: Okay. Real good. And like I say, it's coming up - it will be a - a little sun angle, but maybe we can hack it, and at your convenience, we'd like to have inverter 3, Off, and the rendezvous radar transponder, Off.
208:51:35 Scott: Okay. Inverter 3 is Off and we'll go down and get the transponder
208:51:39 Roosa: Okay. And we'd like to turn the fans off in both H2 tanks.
208:51:46 Scott: Okay. H2 fans are both Off
208:51:51 Roosa: Okay. Our good old RCS configuration for the day will be quads Baker and Charlie, and Baker Delta roll.
208:52:03 Roosa: Okay, and make that H2 tank 1 fan, On, please.
208:52:04 Scott: Okay. Baker and Charlie, and Baker Delta roll.
208:52:15 Scott: Okay. H2 tank 1 fan is On.
MADRID (REV 132)
208:52:23 Roosa: Very good. And you might whip up your old S-band volume there. We'll have Madrid here for 4 or 5 minutes.
208:52:31 Scott: Okay. S-band is up.
208:52:43 McDivitt: Houston, how do you read Apollo 9?
208:52:45 Roosa: I'm reading you loud and clear, Jim.
208:52:49 McDivitt: Okay. Like you say, it wasn't getting out before, I guess I just didn't have all these things plugged in quite right. One of my things keeps coming loose.
208:52:59 Roosa: Maybe it's wearing out. Good morning.
208:53:01 McDivitt: Hello there.
208:53:04 McDivitt: Hey, I've got a little question. How come we almost never use quad A? At least it seems to be the least one that we require the least out of for Service Module RCS deorbit, yet we seem to have the most fuel in it.
208:53:23 Roosa: Okay. Stand by one, here, and let me give you a good answer on that.
208:53:39 Roosa: Okay, Apollo 9. The answer to that one is that you require the most out of that for an SPS deorbit and we're trying to hang on to the SPS deorbit capability.
208:53:53 McDivitt: Okay. That's a pretty good answer.
208:54:XX Roosa: Okay. Apollo 9, we're going to - I've only got you for about another 3 or 4 minutes here at Madrid. And so, I don't think - I could get in a consumable update if you've got a handy PAD for that.
208:54:23 McDivitt: Okay. All set - go ahead.
208:54:25 Roosa: All right. Hours 209 42 10 42 12 38 13 39 13 2 4 3 15 31 33 39; and your DAP redlines: 25 31 34 34. End of update.
208:55:08 McDivitt: Roger. 209 42 10 42 12 38 13 39 13 2 4 3 15 31 33 39 25 31 34 34
208:55:24 Roosa: That is affirmative, and that's correct.
208:55:28 McDivitt: Okay.
208:56:01 McDivitt: Roger. 209 plus 25 for battery A charge.
208:56:06 Roosa: That's correct and I'll wait until we get over Carnarvon for the rest of the block data - I mean to get the block data and the rest of the Flight Plan updates - so we'll probably then lose Madrid here within a minute. It will be Carnarvon at 24.
208:56:22 Scott: Roger. You don't havppen to have a handy map update, do you?
208:56:26 Roosa: That is affirmative. Your map update: 208:34:44, 73 degrees west.
208:56:41 Scott: Roger. That's pretty snappy. 208:34:44, 73 degrees west.
208:56:47 Roosa: Roger, Doc. And I meant to get that for you. I had it all sitting out here and blew it.
208:56:51 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, Houston. We'd like to start a battery A charge at 209 plus 25.
208:56:52 Scott: Oh, listen, that's all right. Looks like you must have told them...
208:56:57 Roosa: No, I had - I had just updated my map here to check that Australia bit. And we'll see you down there. I hope you make before sunset.
208:57:07 Scott: Oh, we'll make sure. We wouldn't miss Australia for anything.
208:57:12 Roosa: Hey, look at this rare opportunity you have. Australia in the daylight.
208:57:16 Scott: How about that!
CARNARVON (REV 132)
This is Apollo Control. The crew was awakened during the middle of the Canary Island pass. And was furnished with the consumables update and given instructions for a photography assignment on the upcoming pass over Australia when, for the first time in the mission, that it will see parts of Australia in daylight. The Carnarvon- Honeysuckle pass will come at 23 minutes past the hour, followed shortly thereafter with about a 2-minute break to the tracking ship Mercury. At 208 hours, 58 minutes GET; this is Apollo Control.
209:19:29 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, he's doing alright [garble]. That could be part of the [garble] group. We're going exactly backwards.I can't see what's coming. Yes, we're going past Sumatra, right now.
209:21:44 Schweickart (onboard): Oh, look where we took those other pictures at. Yes, that's [garble].
This is Apollo Control; 209 hours, 23 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 9 is now midway through the 132nd revolution and is just south of the island of Java in the republic of Indonesia. Coming up on Carnarvon, Australia tracking station, within a few seconds. We'll stand by for any conversation between Mission Control and the crew of Apollo 9. Flight Director is down in the trench discussing some aspect of the mission with the Flight Dynamics Officer. Here goes the call from Roosa.
Spacecraft communicator Stu Roosa is conferring with Flight Activities Officer on some last minute additions and Flight Plan notes prior to beginning communications here at Carnarvon. We'll continue to stand by until Roosa does call the crew
209:25:50 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston; 1 minute LOS. We'll see you over the sunny Caribbean around 10. [Garble].
209:25:58 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, we'll be ready.
209:26:01 Roosa: Roger.
209:26:04 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
209:26:08 Schweickart: Roger.
209:26:10 Schweickart: Fine. We're all set to take pictures.
209:26:15 Roosa: Very good. Looks like you're in a race with the terminator.
209:26:19 Schweickart: Yes. It sure does, it's getting dark pretty quick.
209:26:22 Roosa: Roger. I checked the sunset time on that. On the ground you'll be taking with about 2 minutes or a little over before sunset. We'll say a 5-degree sun angle.
This is Apollo Control. Standing by over Carnarvon as the crew proceeds to take the assigned pictures in that area. Conversation is being held to a minimum till they do complete that picture taking assignment. We'll leave the circuit open for continuation of the conversation between spacecraft communicator Stu Roosa and the crew of Apollo 9.
209:29:27 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, Houston. Bring up your S-band volume. We'll be going over Honeysuckle in about a minute.
209:29:35 Scott: Okay.
209:29:39 Schweickart: Looks like all those people down in Australia probably still asleep.
209:29:53 Roosa: Well let me see, they shouldn't have gone to bed yet, should they? It just got dark across there.
209:30:00 Schweickart: Oh, that's the way the Sun goes. It goes from east to west. I thought it went from west to east.
209:30:06 Roosa: (Laughter) Well, I've got a gauge here. I can call up the display and I can watch the terminator move so I don't have to do any thinking.
209:30:13 Scott: Stu, would you send that gauge up here?
209:30:15 Roosa: Roger.
209:30:33 Roosa: And we'll have Honeysuckle about 7 or 8 minutes. It might be a good place to get the block data at y'all's convenience. When you get through looking across the mainland, there.
HONEYSUCKLE (REV 132)
209:31:35 Roosa: And we've got you locked up on Honeysuckle now - about 6 minutes.
209:31:40 Scott: Okay. You're loud and clear on old Honeysuckle today.
209:31:44 Roosa: You're coming in five-square.
209:31:51 McDivitt: Is it really only 3:30 in the morning in Houston?
209:31:55 Roosa: That's affirmative.
209:32:01 Roosa: I always hate to mention that - the time - because I thought it might make you (laugh) harder to get up.
209:32:08 Scott: If I'd just known then what I know now.
209:33:12 Roosa: Come on, now.
209:33:17 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. We'd like to know if you happened to notice any stratification when you stirred the cryos this morning.
209:33:30 Scott: Yes, we haven't done it yet, Stu.
209:33:32 Roosa: Okay, very good. We've just seen some funnies on our last data pass, there.
209:33:40 Scott: All I've done is turn off the H2 fan and turn on the H1 fan.
209:33:48 Roosa: Okay. Understand.
209:33:53 McDivitt: Of course we've turned the transponder on, too.
209:33:57 Roosa: Very good.
209:34:02 Roosa: How about a crew status report if you're up there; we'll make the Surgeon happy. Just get that out of the way right off.
209:34:10 McDivitt: Okay. The commander had about 7½ hours sleep and one vitamin pill.
209:34:17 Scott: And the CMP had about 7½ hours sleep and one vitamin pill.
209:34:22 Schweickart: And the LMP had about 6½ hours sleep and one vitamin pill.
209:34:28 Roosa: Roger. Copy all that and good morning, Rusty.
209:37:27 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, Houston. We're about 30 seconds from LOS Honeysuckle. Mercury around 42.
209:37:34 McDivitt: Okay. I think we'll stop and have breakfast now.
209:37:38 Roosa: All right. Sounds like a good idea.
MERCURY (REV 132)
This is Apollo Control. Not quite out of acquisition yet at Honeysuckle. Conversation will likely pick up again over Mercury in about 2 minutes. During the Carnarvon - Honeysuckle pass, the crew reported that the Commander, James McDivitt, had a total of 7½ hours sleep, Dave Scott, had 7½ hours, LMP, Rusty Schweickart, 6½ hours, and each took one vitamin pill last night. Several cities in the southern portion of the United States, weather permitting, may have an opportunity to view Apollo 9. Starting at 5:42:31, 5 hours, 5:42 and 31 seconds am Central Standard Time in Houston, the spacecraft will rise in the southwest, reach a maximum elevation of 8 degrees, and at 5:46, set in the east at 5:49:31. Slant range at maximum elevation will be 692 nautical miles [1,282 km]. New Orleans, a few seconds later, at 5:42:54 am Central Standard Time, spacecraft will rise from the south-southwest, from maximum elevation of 11.9 degrees, will set at 5:50:56 Central in the east. Slant range at maximum elevation will be 559 nautical miles [1,035 km]. Atlanta, 6:44:50 Eastern Standard Time, the spacecraft will rise out of the south-southwest, reach a maximum elevation of 9.3 degrees, at 6:48:31, will set in the east southeast at 6:52:14. Maximum slant range at maximum elevation will be 618 nautical miles [1,145 km]. On the following revolution, Phoenix, 6:14:50 Mountain Standard Time, spacecraft will rise out of the southwest, reach a maximum elevation of 7 degrees, at 6:18:31 will set in the east-southeast at 6:21:45. Slant range, maximum elevation 711.5 nautical miles [1,318 km]. Less than a minute later, El Paso, 7:15:07, Central Standard Time, the spacecraft will rise out of the south-southwest, reach a maximum elevation of 14.3 degrees at 7:19:31, will set in the east at 7:23:16. Slant range, maximum elevation will be 481.1 nautical miles [891 km]. We should have had acquisition at tracking ship Mercury at this time. The pass over Mercury will be some 10 minutes long, even though its not dead center over the ship. The passes in the southern hemisphere, particularly over the Australian stations and Mercury are fairly lengthy because the spacecraft is at apogee at this point and being higher provides a longer tracking time.
209:40:26 Scott (onboard): Well, we'll make sure.
209:40:28 Schweickart (onboard): We wouldn't miss Australia for anything.
209:40:35 Scott (onboard): How about that?
Spacecraft communicator Stu Roosa is in a confab with other flight controllers here in Mission Control Center. We'll stand by until he keys his transmitter to resume conversation with the crew. Still standing by. In acquisition of tracking ship Mercury. Next station following Mercury will be the MILA, Merritt Island, launch area tracking station at 9 minutes past the hour. Here goes Roosa's call, we hope.
209:44:48 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston through Mercury. Standing by.
209:44:83 Scott: Roger.
209:46:21 Schweickart: Houston, Apollo 9.
209:46:22 Roosa: Go ahead, Apollo 9.
209:46:23 Schweickart: Roger. Our power was down a little bit there so we just put the transponder back on to keep that same power we would on the fuel cells.
209:46:33 Roosa: Roger. Copy.
This is Apollo Control, some 2 minutes remaining in the Mercury tracking ship pass. The crew likely is breaking out their breakfast meals for this morning prior to settling down for the day's Flight Plan activities. Been a real sparse amount of conversation over Mercury. Starting with MILA tracking station at 9 minutes past the hour, there'll be a continuous tracking and communications pass all the way through Madrid 32 minutes past the hour; about 21 minutes duration altogether.
This is Apollo Control. Apparently that does terminate the conversation over tracking ship Mercury. MILA at 9:48 past the hour. At 209 hours 51...
209:51:15 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. One minute LOS, we'll see you over the sunny Caribbean around 10.
209:51:22 McDivitt: Okay, we'll be ready.
209:51:25 Roosa: Roger
MILA (REV 133)
209:53:53 McDivitt (onboard): Oh, boy! I'm tired, so tired. That muscle that I've developed in my back is just - It keeps grabbing me [garble] bends me the wrong way.
209:54:11 Scott (onboard): (Laughter)
209:54:12 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble], too. Boy, it sure catches.
209:55:10 McDivitt (onboard): (Singing)
209:59:57 Schweickart (onboard): Well, I don't know of any that we took [garble].
210:00:11 Schweickart (onboard): Hey, I'm just - Jim, [garble].
210:00:15 McDivitt (onboard): Yes, I thought of that, too. We ought to call the ground right now and tell them to flag the photo guys on that EVA film [garble]. That's something really looking for [garble]. I have this horrible feeling that [garble] run it through the bath [garble]. I don't [garble] - What - what MAG is that? [Garble].
210:00:55 McDivitt (onboard): E, Echo.
This is Apollo Control; 210 hours, 09 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 9 is just ending the 132nd revolution. We'll begin revolution 133 within a few moments as it crosses the longitude of Cape Kennedy. We've just had acquisition at the Merritt Island launch area tracking station in Florida overlapping, of course, with Antigua, Bermuda, Vanguard on through to Canary and Madrid. A pass ending at 32 minutes past the hour. We'll stand by here as we await Stu Roosa's call to the crew.
210:11:59 Roosa: Apollo 9, this is Houston. We've got you through MILA. Standing by.
210:12:05 Scott: Roger, Houston.
210:12:14 Schweickart: Hey, Smokey. One thing that we're a little concerned about here, this morning we're going to be dipping back into a magazine of film that was taken with a slightly faulty camera. On the EVA we took the 70mm wide angle out with magazine Echo on it and we found out subsequent to the EVA that the superwide was keeping the shutter open too long, or at least we think that it did, so we ran off an extra 10 or so frames with nothing on them. Now we're going to use the remaining 100 today, so we want to make sure that when that film pack gets back that the photo people know about it that the first part of the film, the first third, may be exposed different from the last third - for the last two thirds, rather.
210:13:10 Roosa: Okay. Understand now. To make sure that we got that, that 70mm and the magazine is Echo.
210:13:18 Schweickart: That's affirmative. We're not really sure when the camera malfunctioned, so the first third may also be okay, but we don't have any way of knowing it. We know that the superwide keeps the shutter open for about three to five times as long as it should, it looks like, and so we're going to need special handling on the first third of that roll of film.
210:13:42 Roosa: Okay. Suspect the superwide may have kept the shutter open two to three times normal. And on that same subject, Rusty, we were just kicking around here, a 1 16mm magazine is the word I have that may have been exposed at a wrong setting during EVA. Is this correct?
210:14:15 Schweickart: Yes, that's affirmative, Houston, some of the 16mm magazines may have been exposed at the wrong setting.
210:14:26 Roosa: Okay. At your convenience would you like to give us that magazine identification so we could sure that the word gets out?
210:14:38 Schweickart: Okay. We'll have to find out what the number of it wsa.
210:14:43 Roosa: Roger. I suspect it's probably buried down somewhere, but anyway you'd like - but we would like to know it so we could warn people.
210:14:52 Schweickart: Okay. Well it was - we took some of the stuff apparently set at 1/60 and the rest of it at 1/250, so it's going to be a little tough to retrieve, I think. Let me get the magazine letter for you.
210:15:48 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, Houston. There are a couple of targets we'd like photographed on this rev if you're so inclined. One is around the Red Sea area about 15 minutes from now and the other one is about 17 minutes after it.
210:16:05 Schweickart: Houston. I believe the magazine letter was P, magazine Peter, Papa, and we took about two-thirds of it during the EVA. The first part of it was probably exposed at 1/60 of a second and the remainder at 1/250.
210:16:29 Roosa: Roger. Copy. You exposed two-thirds of it during the EVA and the first third at 1/60 and the rest at 250.
210:16:38 Schweickart: Roger. And they're the same subject material for it.
210:16:45 Roosa: Roger. Copy. Thank you very much.
210:16:48 Schweickart: Okay.
210:16:50 Scott: Okay. Go ahead with the updates. Stu, the photo update.
210:16:55 Roosa: Okay. The first one: time, 210 plus 39 plus 34; seven frames; 16-second interval; zero degrees; and this will be the Red Sea; oceanography. The second one: time 2 plus 10 plus 52 plus 07; three frames; 20-second interval; you'll be shooting north of the nadir 30 degrees. This is weather and should be a tropical depression up there.
VANGUARD (REV 133)
210:18:00 Scott: Okay. Let me see if I got these right: 210:39:14, seven frames, 16 second intervals, zero degrees, Red Sea, Oceanography; 210:50:07, three frames, 29 seconds, north 30, weather, tropical depression.
210:18:01 Roosa: Okay. The time on the Red Sea is 39 plus 34.
210:18:02 Scott: 39 plus 34. Okay.
210:18:14 Roosa: And the time on the tropical depression is 52 plus 07.
210:18:18 Scott: 52:07. Right.
210:18:41 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, I have some block data. At your convenience, I'll pass it to you.
210:18:53 Roosa: You're still good for about another rev and a half, so no sweat on the time.
210:18:59 Schweickart: Okay. Let's go ahead and start it now.
210:19:03 Roosa: Say again, Rusty.
210:19:06 Schweickart: Yes, I'm ready to copy, Stu.
210:19:09 Roosa: Okay. I'll tell you what, Rusty, we're through the Vanguard now and it's a little static. Let's wait until we get handed over to Canaries. I think it would be better.
210:19:17 Schweickart: Okay.
CANARY (REV 133)
This is Apollo Control. Communications have been terminated during this pass over the tracking ship Vanguard because of static. Pick up again in about 3 minutes as the spacecraft crosses into the Canary Island tracking station range. We'll continue to monitor the air-ground circuit for any possible conversation.
This is Apollo Control, continuing to monitor the spacecraft pass over Vanguard and on into the Canarys at which time it is anticipated that conversation will resume. Have a considerable amount of static in cmnmunications through the Vanguard. Yesterday the Vanguard had some problems with its COMSAT relay antenna and had to use an HF link. That problem may still exist and account for the static.
210:24:13 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. How do you read?
210:24:19 Schweickart: Five-square, Houston.
210:24:22 Roosa: Okay. I have block data number 21 when you're ready to copy.
210:24:31 Schweickart: All set.
210:24:33 Roosa: Reading: 135 2 Bravo, plus 292, minus 0270 213 16 11 3255, 136 2 Bravo, plus 226, minus 0330 214 53 00 3332; 137 1 Alpha, plus 276, minus 0680, 216 19 52 3380; 138 4 Alpha, plus 331, minus 1624 218 58 21 3232; 139 4 Alpha, plus 331, minus 1624 220 39 20 3026; 140 4 Baker, plus 286 minus 1640 222 20 10 3200. Would you bring up your S-band volume here before I continue? We'll be handing over into Madrid shortly. And pitch, minus 0.64, yaw, minus 0.94. End of update.
MADRID (REV 133)
210:27:50 Schweickart: Okay, Stu. Readback: 135 2 Bravo, plus 292, minus 0270 213 16 11 3255, 136 2 Bravo, plus 226, minus 0330 214 53 00 3332; 137 1 Alpha, plus 276, minus 0680, 216 19 52 3380; 138 4 Alpha, plus 331, minus 1624 218 58 21 3232; 139 4 Alpha, plus 331, minus 1624 220 39 20 3026; 140 4 Baker, plus 286 minus 1640 222 20 10 3200. Pitch, minus 0.64, yaw, minus 0.94.
210:28:55 Roosa: Roger. That readback is correct. Thank you.
210:29:00 Schweickart: Okay.
210:30:44 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, about 1 minute LOS Madrid; and we'll see you over Carnarvon around 58.
210:30:54 Schweickart: Roger. Carnarvon around 58.
CARNARVON (REV 133)
This is Apollo Control at about a minute to LOS at Canary Islands, but apparently the conversation between Stu Roosa and the crew of Apollo 9 has been concluded. Carnarvon at 57 minutes past the hour. At 210 hours, 31 minutes GET; this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control; 210 hours, 57 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We're coming up over the Carnarvon, Australia tracking station overlapping Honeysuckle for a 19-minute total duration pass of Apollo 9. We anticipate further conversation over these two stations. After Honeysuckle Loss of Signal, there will be approximately a 2-minute dropout until - actually more like 1-minute dropout between Honeysuckle and tracking ship Mercury. The Mercury pass looks like about 12 minutes duration. Will stand by now for spacecraft communicator Stu Roosa's call to the crew over Carnarvon. He's now studying the acquisition time tables to determine when best to call the crew.
210:59:00 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon.
210:59:04 Schweickart: Roger, Houston.
210:59:10 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, Houston. We'd like to use Alpha Charlie's roll today, instead of Baker Dog as we passed up before.
210:59:20 Schweickart: Understand: Alpha Charlie roll instead of Bravo Dog.
210:59:24 Roosa: That's affirmative, and just a little note on that. What we'd like to do is get into that secondary propellant tank on one of the quads and we think that'll probably be quad C and this one allows any of our deorbits. We'll still have our SCS deorbit capability.
210:59:44 Schweickart: Okay.
210:59:48 Schweickart: The action has been took.
210:59:51 Roosa: Very good. Thank you.
210:59:56 Schweickart: Say there, worker of miracles. What's the balmy picure on the surface in the recovery area?
211:00:06 Roosa: I can find that out for you. I have neglected to mention that subject so far here. I was going to wait until you brought it up.
211:00:27 Schweickart: I was afraid you were going to...
211:00:44 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, Houston. I have you about another 6½ minutes to Carnarvon here, and I have five or six items on the Flight Plan update for today.
211:00:56 Schweickart: Okay, stand by.
211:01:24 Schweickart: Okay. Go ahead, Stu.
211:01:26 Roosa: Okay. The first one is at 212 plus 38 and I'll just make this comment now which will apply later in here. As you see it in your timeline everything is shifted around 20 minutes or so due to the orbit, so if it looks like night or day or something is off, well that's the reason. But at 212 plus 38 we'd like to have a P51, P52 alignment to P52 to Nominal, and your T-align is 216 plus 10 plus 00.
211:02:54 Roosa: Okay. Now, at 214 plus 30 - and want to make sure we don't get confused here - I'm deleting the second S065 pass here - the one that is shown for over Africa. Now in your Flight Plan that's shown right around 215, but that is the pass. We're deleting that S065 pass due to weather. We still want the first S065 pass across the States, and we'll have a pass for you later on that. Okay, now, 215 plus 38 for P52 to REFSMMAT. And at 217 plus 10, we'd like to have a COAS calibration. Now, you gave us a real good alignment yesterday with the COAS, and on the change of shift of the flight planning people here, I can't find any good details on why we want another one. I think there's a requirement that says that you need one the day before re-entry. But it looks like you've probably got a good one, but we'll stick that one in there - 217 plus 10. And at 217 plus 50, we'll do some P22 landmark tracking.
211:03:35 Roosa: Your powerdown will be 218 plus 35, and at 219 plus 00 we'll have a fuel cell O2 purge. And that's the end of it.
211:04:19 Schweickart: Okay. 212 38 P51, 52 to Nominal 216:10:00. At 214:30 we want to delete the second S065 pass over Africa due to weather. We still want to keep the first one across the States. 215:38 P52 to REFSMMAT; 207:10 COAS calibration; 217:50, P52 landmark track; 218:35 power down, 219:00, fuel cell O2 purge.
211:04:51 Roosa: That's affirmative, Rusty. You got them all. And I'd just like to ask a question on curiosity; I was wondering how that Y and N panel worked out.
211:05:02 Schweickart: Oh that works great, Stu. Good job on that.
211:05:06 Roosa: How about with the corona pack? Do you get - Does it fit in there all right? You know we really need a mount around that, and I was wondering about the light leak around the edge.
211:05:17 Scott: Well, I had trouble getting the Verb-Noun list out. It took me about 5 days to get that out, and when I finally go that out, I haven't had a chance to put the corner pack up.
211:05:27 Roosa: You mean it was jammed in there?
211:05:29 Scott: Yes, it sure was.
211:05:32 Roosa: Ouch, that doesn't sound like it was so good. Sorry about that.
211:05:36 Schweickart: Oh, no sweat. I think we'll work that out when we get back.
211:05:40 McDivitt: Stu, I have a question on the S065. Looks like we have many more frames of film left on the camera there than we have allocated for pictures today. I don't think we ought to come back with any film left in those cameras.
211:05:54 Roosa: Roger. Copy, Jim.
211:05:57 McDivitt: And I guess, what I'm saying is that soon as we get through those S065's that are programmed, I thihnk we'll just leave it in the window and take pictures until we run out.
211:06:07 Roosa: Yes, we're going to use it all today and it's being planned that way.
211:06:13 McDivitt: Oh, okay. Fine.
211:06:22 Roosa: And Jim, just to clarify it, this 16mm roll taken during EVA that you exposed 2/3 of it - that is all that's been exposed on that roll, is that affirmative?
211:06:37 McDivitt: That's affirmative. We're going to go take some Sun going down into the water pictures with the rest of it.
211:06:43 Roosa: Okay. Very good. So the rest of it will be exposed, but we're really looking at the first 2/3 of it on the EVA.
211:06:51 McDivitt: That's affirmative.
211:06:54 Roosa: Okay. Real good.
211:06:57 Roosa: We've got to make sure that's developed right.
211:07:00 McDivitt: Roger. Copy, Jim.
211:07:02 Roosa: And let's have S-band volume up, please.
211:07:06 McDivitt: You took part of it at 1/250. All with the same subject matter.
MERCURY (REV 133)
211:11:38 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston.
211:11:52 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston.
This is Apollo Control. About 3 minutes remaining in the Honeysuckle pass, with about a minute drop out after Honeysuckle LOS until Mercury acquisition. Will continue to monitor the air-to-ground circuit. Likely won't be too much additional conversation during these passes, but we'll leave the circuit up just in case.
This is Apollo Control. Apollo 9 presently is crossing just to the north of the island of New Zealand, and is midway through the 133rd revolution. About 10 seconds to LOS at Honeysuckle, acquisition at tracking ship Mercury will be at 17 minutes, 44 seconds; just over a minute away, LOS Honeysuckle. We're going to leave the air-to-ground circuits open for acquisition Mercury, and any conversation that might take place over that ship
211:18:12 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston through Mercury.
211:18:17 Schweickart: Roger Houston, you're coming five-square.
211:18:18 Roosa: Reading you real good, and we'd like to have the fan in H2 tank 1, Off at this time.
211:18:33 Schweickart: Okay. H2 tank 1 fan, Off.
211:18:42 Roosa: Roger, thank you. And I have the temperatures in the recovery areas, water temperature is 69. The air temperature is 64. That's as of 1000 Z this morning.
211:19:01 McDivitt: Okay, they have the forecast with them for tomorrow. Stu, as far as temperatures or anything else goes?
211:19:10 Roosa: Well, we've got a forecast yes, I suppose you're interested in that?
211:19:21 Scott: The way you worded that you stimulated our interest.
211:19:29 Roosa: Okay, now I don't know what to say.
211:19:34 Roosa: Okay, here's the way it stacks up. I'll read it to you straight. 1530 2000 scattered variable, broken, high broken clouds, 10 miles. Visibility, wind. 31 knots. Waves 68 feet swell 10 to 12 feet. How does that sound?
211:20:07 Scott: Nice visibility.
211:20:11 Roosa: Hey, that was a beautiful answer. Okay. 1530, 2 thousand scattered 10 miles. Visibility, wind light and variable waves two to three feet and swell six to seven feet.
211:20:30 McDivitt: Hey, let's go there! Let's go there!
211:20:33 Schweickart: Yes. Take a pick, Stu.
211:20:35 Roosa: Roger.
211:20:40 McDivitt: Gee you sure made that dramatic Stu.
211:20:47 Roosa: The weather I read you first was the prime recovery area.
211:20:58 McDivitt: Are they still considering it to be the prime one they're going to shift it down one rev.?
211:21:02 Roosa: This has not been decided yet, Jim. Of course, that will come here within a few hours. But just reading the weather, I'm sure you can make that decision also.
211:21:20 McDivitt: Yes. What kind of backup capabilities do we have if we don't get an SPS retro and have to do Service Module RCS retro for the following Rev? where does that put us with respect to land? Will we still come down on the water?
211:21:38 Roosa: Okay, Jim that's what we're hustling so much over here right now. And what's making the retro all gray headed. We don't have one on the next rev in the Atlantic so that's what gets this hairy is the - that we go to the backup area here, which the weather certainly dictates well then that puts us into the Pacific for a back up deorbit.
211:22:15 McDivitt: Okay. If we go into the Pacific, how does the propellant requirement change with respect to our anomaly for retro into the Pacific?
211:22:26 Roosa: No real change, Jim, and I think we're looking what? Around Hawaii - is it that - the backup landing area is in the Hawaii area
211:22:39 McDivitt: How's the weather there?
211:22:42 Roosa: We are thinking we haven't got a real good hack on it yet. Retro and recovery are hustling that out right now, Jim.
211:22:51 McDivitt: Okay, I think I know which way we all want to go. I think you probably know which way we all want to go too.
211:22:58 McDivitt: And Stu, consider the fact that we do have some specific experience up here in case that's needed.
211:23:04 Roosa: Roger copy. [laughter ]
211:23:08 Scott: I'll tell you one thing I don't want to get in that part of the Pacific.
211:23:14 Schweickart: Hey Stu. As far as the temperature is concerned, they might bring along some - on the recovery. They might bring along some fuzzy knickers. Ours are pretty thin up here.
211:23:24 Roosa: Alright, copy that, Rusty.
This is Apollo Control, approximately 2 minutes remaining of the Mercury tracking ship pass.
211:27:21 Roosa: Apollo 9 Houston we've got about two minutes in this nice long pass. We'll be uplinking a state vector once we get you in Texas acquisition. I've got a nav check. You can either copy it now or there
211:27:37 McDivitt: Oh, we've got a piece of paper here. Stu.
211:27:40 Roosa: Okay reading the nav check 212:40:00, minus 3282 plus 11997 2127.
211:28:05 Schweickart: Okay. 212:40:00 minus 3282 plus 11997 2127.
211:28:15 Roosa: That's affirmative.
211:28:35 Roosa: And Apollo 9, Houston.
211:28:38 McDivitt: Roger. Go.
211:28:38 Roosa: Roger. I guess, just to close the loop on our discussion here, we'll have the ship at 152-1, if and when you come down there. So I just thought I might toss that in, in case you're wanting it.
211:28:53 Schweickart: Yes. Will it have the 350 pound cake on it?
211:28:56 Roosa: Yes, it will have a 350 pound cake on it. At least that's the word I have.
211:29:01 Schweickart: Okay. Great!
211:29:02 Roosa: And we'll lose you here in about 10 seconds and have you through Texas around 41.
211:29:08 McDivitt: Roger did you say you've got the state vector in?
211:29:11 Roosa: Oh, negative. I said we're going to uplink the state vector at Texas acquisition and I've just given you the Nav check now.
211:29:20 McDivitt: Okay. Thank you.
211:29:22 Roosa: Roger.
TEXAS [REV 133 ]
This is Apollo Control, we've had LOS at tracking ship Mercury. Next station to acquire will be the tracking station at Texas overlapping MILA, Bermuda, Antigua, Vanguard, Canary Islands, and Madrid for a total 26 minutes tracking. Texas coming up at 40 minutes past the hour, about 10 minutes from now. At 211 hours, 30 minutes GET; this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control; 211 hours, 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Should have acquisition at this time with - through the tracking station at Corpus Christi. We're standing by for resumption of the conversation begun over tracking ship Mercury with additional Flight Plan updates, targets of opportunity for photography tasks and other assignments to the crew of Apollo 9 for the days activities.This particular stateside pass has a duration of some 26 minutes. The next stateside pass on revolution 134 will take in the tracking ship Redstone, the tracking station at Guaymas, Mexico and add perhaps another 15 minutes to the total time across the States and the Atlantic tracking ship Vanguard, Canary Islands and Madrid. Still awaiting the resumption of conversation between Stu Roosa here in Mission Control and the crew of Apollo 9
211:43:08 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston through Texas.
211:43:11 Schweickart: Roger, Houston.
211:43:14 Roosa: And if you will give us P00 and Accept we'll uplink your state vector and I'd like to ask you a question about P22.
211:43:23 Schweickart: Okay
211:43:26 Roosa: Okay, Dave, what we're thinking of here is on this uplink into the CSM slot and leaving the vector as is in the LM slot. And then prior to P22, shoving the vector from the LM into the CSM and doing a P22 on it to see how it can bring in the state vector rather than starting the P22 with a good vector.
Program 22 is a tracking program. Marks can be taken on a landmark through the sextant which will allow the spacecraft's state vector to be calculated.
211:43:55 Scott: Okay I think that's probably a pretty good idea.
211:44:01 Roosa: By Jove! I get one up and then okay. So this vector we're uplinking now, we'll not Verb 66 it. It will be in the CSM slot.
211:44:27 Scott: Are you still with us Stu?
211:44:28 Roosa: Roger, we got you through Texas here now. This will be a nice long pass.
211:44:33 Scott: Okay, you just faded. I guess then what we want to do just prior to P22 is do a Verb 47.
211:44:40 Roosa: That's affirmative. Verb 47 back over into the CSM slot and then let's see how the P22 does. Then we'll give you a good vector in both slots after the end of it.
211:44:52 Scott: Sounds like a fine idea. How did those work out yesterday that I ran?
211:44:57 Roosa: You're fading way out on me, Dave.
211:45:00 Scott: I say how did it work out yesterday?
211:45:04 Schweickart: Okay, we're breaking up here too.
211:45:10 Scott: I say again, how did the state vector updates work out yesterday?
211:45:16 Roosa: Okay, I don't really have that info Dave. I wasn't here and I haven't talked to anybody that's got a good handle on how they went. I read through the transcripts, and it looked like it went well. But I can't answer your questions specifically. We'll get an answer for you though.
211:45:33 Scott: Oh don't worry about it, I was just curious. We can pick it up post flight. No sweat.
211:45:42 Roosa: Okay. And Apollo 9 we are through with the uplink and we have not transferred it to the LM slot. The computer is yours.
211:45:50 Scott: Roger. Thank you.
CANARY [REV 134 ]
This is Apollo Control, some 16 minutes remaining in this stateside and Atlantic station Canary Island pass. Continuing to monitor the air to ground. Spacecraft communicator Stu Roosa is in a huddle, leaning over the console of the Flight Director Pete Frank. We'll leave the air to ground circuit open for any further conversation during the remaining 15 minutes.
211:55:46 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston.
211:55:50 Scott: Go, Houston.
211:55:55 Roosa: Okay, just to clarify this, I will have the exact times for you later. But talking of this P22 Nav update, here - we'll - when you do this Verb 47 we'll have that over a site somewhere. So as soon as you do that we will then uplink a good vector into the LM slot. That way we won't leave you at any time without a good vector.
211:56:20 Scott: You don't think we can get our vector update properly with P22? Come on.
211:56:25 McDivitt: Listen, I'm with you, Stu. Update us a good one.
211:56:29 Roosa: Well, now, Dave it's just your question there. Like we believe you can use that P37 but we'll still send your block data.
211:56:38 Scott: Oh, I was just kidding you. I'll tell you what. We'll have contest to see whose state vector is the best after P22, okay?
211:56:46 Roosa: Hey, I think that's a good lick.
211:56:51 Scott: I think I know who will win.
211:57:28 Roosa: And Apollo 9, I have about three more targets here we'd like photographed. One of them is coming up in about 7 or 8 minutes. If you can't make it, why no sweat.
211:57:38 McDivitt: Go ahead.
211:57:40 Roosa: Okay, the first one: 212 plus 04 plus 16, four frames, 7-second intervals, zero degrees. This is of Morocco for geology.
211:58:01 Roosa: Did you get that? It sounded like I faded out.
211:58:07 McDivitt: Say again
211:58:10 Roosa: Roger did you get the first update? It sounded to me like I faded out on you.
211:58:12 McDivitt: No, we've got it.
211:58:13 Roosa: Oh, Okay. The second one is geolo - well, the time 212:10:36, 4 frames, 6-second exposure intervals, zero degrees. And these are the old Tibetsi mountains here in Chad. And you are going to come over them this time.
211:58:38 McDivitt: Okay.
211:58:40 Roosa: And our third one is 212 plus 16 plus 11, 7 pictures, 19-second interval, zero degrees and this is with Ethiopia Rift Valley - study on the geology there. And the last one is 212 plus 19 plus 07, three pictures, 8-second intervals, zero degrees, and this is geology and this is of Somalia.
211:59:21 Roosa: And that's all the updates I have now.
211:59:26 Scott: Okay, thank you.
211:59:28 Roosa: Roger.
This is Apollo Control, some 6 minutes remaining now in the pass over Canary Islands tracking station - station in Madrid. We'll continue to monitor air-to-ground circuit.
This is Apollo Control. Some 3 minutes until Loss of Signal out of Madrid. Continuing to monitor air-to-ground for any further conversation.
This is Apollo Control. We've passed the time for Loss of Signal at tracking station Madrid. Carnarvon at 33 minutes past the hour. Continuous coverage from Carnarvon through Honeysuckle, tracking ship Huntsville, on over to the Mercury for a total time of about 31 minutes. At 212 hours, 07 minutes GET; this is Apollo Control.
212:07:44 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. If you read, we'll see you over Carnarvon at 34.
CARNARVON [REV 134 ]
This is Apollo Control; 212 hours, 33 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Coming up on tracking ship, or as you were - tracking station Carnarvon, Australia. Will have a rather lengthy pass because the spacecraft is in apogee and at the higher altitudes, the passes naturally last longer. Carnarvon overlaps Honeysuckle which in turn overlaps Huntsville on across to Mercury. Or it looks like approximately 31 minutes total time on this pass, it is almost as long as some of the longer stateside passes. We'll stand by now for the conversation here between Stu Roosa spacecraft communicator and the crew of Apollo 9. We've had acquisition at Carnarvon. We'll leave the circuit open now to await the initial call.
212:35:55 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon.
212:36:00 Schweickart: Good morning
212:36:02 Roosa: Roger.
212:36:06 McDivitt: How are they making out on the recovery position decision?
212:36:12 Roosa: Okay, they're still working on it, Jim. As far as I can tell, I don't see there's much decision to be made. Just really concentrating on the RCS backup on a couple of revs later is the big planning right now.
212:36:29 McDivitt: Okay. Well, that's kind of the way we felt too. There didn't seem to be much choice between those two sites.
212:36:36 Scott: Hey, is that going to be down at 52 1?
212:36:41 Roosa: I cut you out there. I think you're asking about the ship. And I thought that in a little bit to GO-YES, the Guadalcanal should make 152-1 is the latest word I have here.
212:36:53 Scott: Okay, very good.
212:37:11 Roosa: On that ship, might be - that's just some hasty info, Jim. We'll have a good word for you just as soon as we can and the final decision has been made. But I guess it's touch and go and whether or not the ship actually gets there.
212:37:28 McDivitt: Okay. If none get to us, maybe we can fly to it.
212:37:32 Roosa: Roger.
212:37:36 Scott: We need that cake.
212:37:40 Roosa: Roger on the cake.
212:37:50 Roosa: And we're having a time down here on this P22 bit about the state vector. Had a little change of plans. Rather than do as we suggested before, I guess I didn't realize the LM vector would be quite so far out, but we're going to have you do your P22 on the vectors you're carrying now. By then it will have degraded enough the mark should take effect, and also, the first cut at it is we're going to have to change the waiting in this. Right now I don't believe the W Matrix will take the P22 update but we'll zap - we'll give you some numbers. MIT is working this out. They're real anxious to try this too.
212:38:41 Scott: Okay. Very good. We'll go into whatever you like.
212:38:45 Roosa: Okay.
212:39:01 Roosa: Okay, Jim, I just got the word here. There's no doubt about the ship being at 152-1.
212:39:10 McDivitt: Okay. Very good. Have them bring all the good weather they can with it.
212:39:15 Roosa: All right or leave all the bad weather where it is, I guess would be the best way.
212:39:22 Scott: Yes, that's even better. Have those guys been milling around in those big heavy seas all of this time?
212:39:27 Roosa: Yes, they sure have. Just a second here, and I'll give you some info. That temperature, air temperature and water I got from you a while ago was from the Guadalcanal and I say it's 1000 Z and at that time the waves were 4 feet, the swells were 14 feet and the ceiling was 2000 feet. Visibility 7 miles wind blowing 26 knots
212:39:55 McDivitt: Wowee I don't think anybody up here is good enough sailor for that.
212:40:00 Roosa: Roger, and I believe everybody here agrees with that.
212:40:06 McDivitt: But good.
212:42:08 Roosa: And Apollo 9, Houston. Would you bring up your S-band volume for Honeysuckle please?
212:42:12 McDivitt: Roger.
HONEYSUCKLE [REV 134 ]
212:43:04 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, Houston. Anticipate a caution and warning on your H2 pressure.
212:43:11 Schweickart: Roger, Houston. Pressure one on the H2.
This is Apollo Control. Spacecraft is now crossing the Eastern Australia coast between Sidney and Brisbane about midway through rev 134. We're standing by to monitor any further conversation. We still have another 15 minutes in this pass over the Honeysuckle station, the Huntsville and Mercury tracking ships. Continuing to stand by.
212:49:58 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. I have two more targets for you.
212:50:05 Schweickart: Roger, Houston. Just a minute.
212:50:07 Roosa: Roger.
212:50:16 Schweickart: Okay. Go ahead, Stu.
212:50:18 Roosa: Okay. Time, 213 plus 23 plus 54; 3 pictures, 2-second interval shooting 45 degrees north. This is along the Georgia coast and it's for weather. The next one is 213 plus 27 plus 33, three pictures, 20-second interval, 30 degrees south. This is of the Bermuda area, oceanography.
212:51:11 Schweickart: Okay, we got a bunch of Master Alarms here in the middle of that first one on the cryo Press, Stu. Would you let me give you what I got and you can fill me in on the rest? I got 213:23:54. Three pictures, 20-second intervals of the Georgia coast weather. I think you said north or south, but I'm not sure.
212:51:28 Roosa: Roger, it's 45 degrees north.
212:51:40 Schweickart: Okay 45 degrees north and then another at 213:27:33, three pictures, 20-second intervals, 30 degrees south, Bermuda, oceanography.
212:51:50 Roosa: That's affirmative.
212:51:57 Roosa: Okay. I guess you had the right cut there when we were talking about the Georgia coast when you said south I guess I should have said pardon the expression when I said 45 degrees north there
212:52:10 Schweickart: Stu right after you said you guess I had the right cut there, you cut out.
212:52:12 Roosa: Okay. Hey, we'll see you Mercury at 47.
212:52:21 Schweickart: Roger.
Huntsville [REV 134 ]
212:52:24 Roosa: Disregard that. We'll be picking up the Mercury real soon.
212:53:05 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, delay that fool time I gave you there, we've got you through the Huntsville now.
Mercury [REV 134 ]
This is Apollo Control. Some 10 minutes remaining in the pass over Huntsville and Mercury tracking ships. We'll continue to monitor the air-to-ground circuit for any further conversation.
212:55:21 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, This is Houston through Mercury, standing by. Have you about nine minutes.
212:55:27 Schweickart: Roger, Houston.
This is Apollo Control. 8 minutes remaining in the coverage at tracking ship Mercury. Continuing to stand by.
This is Apollo Control. Some 5 minutes remaining now in coverage at tracking ship Mercury. It's unlikely that the conversation will continue until we get into the stateside pass starting at tracking ship Redstone at 8 minutes past the hour, but we'll leave the line open for any further conversation.
212:59:29 Scott: Hello. Houston, Apollo 9. Do you read?
212:59:33 Roosa: That's affirmative, Apollo 9. we'll have you through Mercury another five minutes.
212:59:37 Scott: Okay.
212:59:43 Scott: Just in case my kids are listening, tell them I'm growing a big beard for them.
212:59:55 Roosa: Okay. By Jove!
212:59:58 Roosa: Seems like you ought to bring that back so they could see it.
213:00:04 Scott: Seems that way, doesn't it?
213:00:06 Schweickart: If you think you hear a lot of data down there, man, you ought to be up here.
213:00:10 Roosa: [laughter ]
213:00:24 Roosa: And, we just got another weather forecast in here, and it's just about the same. 152-1 is looking a little better. In fact the height of the swells is going down. Winds light and variable and scattered clouds. 10 miles vis, 2 to 3 foot waves.
213:00:45 McDivitt: That's not bad?
213:00:48 Schweickart: Get the swelling down.
213:00:53 Roosa: Yes. Well, on the last several hours, they've gone from 6 to 8 to 6. So they're going in the right direction.
213:01:03 McDivitt: That's nice.
213:01:09 McDivitt: Who do we have out there measuring them?
213:01:15 Roosa: Well, I don't know if we've got anybody specifically on that site yet or not, Jim.
213:01:23 McDivitt: Okay. I thought maybe we had one of the destroyers down there.
213:01:27 Roosa: Say again, Jim.
213:01:29 McDivitt: I thought maybe we had a destroyer down there.
213:01:32 Roosa: We've got a bunch of ships out in there. Let me find out if - the closest point they're getting their data from there.
213:01:34 Roosa: And along with the weather forecast, the 151 looked just the same. No change in it, it's still looking pretty grim, it will pretty well determine how the decision is going.
213:02:02 McDivitt: Okay.
213:04:15 Roosa: And we're about LOS Mercury. We'll see you Redstone in about 4 minutes.
213:04:21 McDivitt: All right, Houston. We'll be waiting here for you. Waiting for those golden tones.
213:04:26 Roosa: Okay, fine.
213:04:29 McDivitt: Hey, Speaking of golden tones, where is old golden throat these days?
213:04:33 Roosa: I haven't seen old golden throat since I lost myself in this hole over here.
213:04:40 McDivitt: Alrighty.
213:04:45 McDivitt: See you, Houston.
REDSTONE [REV 134 ]
This is Apollo Control, we've had LOS at tracking ship Mercury. Coming up on Redstone at 8 minutes past the hour, for a very lengthy stateside pass. Redstone, Guaymas, Texas, Grand Bahamas, Antigua, Vanguard tracking ship, Canary, and Madrid. And at 213 hours, 5 minutes GET; this is Apollo Control
This is Apollo Control at 213 hours, 8 minutes. Apollo 9 coming within range of the tracking ship Redstone. Gene Kranz and the White Team have relieved Pete Frank and his Orange Team.
Redstone has acquired. We will stand by.
213:09:52 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston through Redstone. How do you read?
213:09:59 Scott: Loud and clear. Go ahead.
213:10:01 Roosa: Roger. I just wanted to tag up on the weather info. We don't have a specific ship at 152-1. Guadalcanal is probably heading that way shortly, but it just comes from other ships all in the area, that's radioed into Miami. I'm having a look. See how close a ship they have got to that area.
213:10:26 McDivitt: Okay. I just thought maybe we had one of our destroyers down there, just sitting there with baited breath, waiting for us, but if not, thank you.
213:10:35 Roosa: Roger.
213:10:36 McDivitt: You don't have to press on any farther with it, Stu.
213:10:38 Roosa: Okay. Just for your info, the Guadalcanal is 16 hours from 152-1. It's also 18 hours. 151 1. It's been covering the 137 dash 1 recovery area, So it's 16 hours out of 152-1, Plenty of time to be there.
213:10:59 McDivitt: Okay, fine.
213:11:02 Roosa: And have...
213:11:03 McDivitt: ...running around in circles.
213:11:06 Roosa: Roger.
213:11:08 McDivitt: Okay.
213:11:09 Roosa: And Dave asked the question about the tracking yesterday. The only thing that we checked in with MIT - the only thing they say is the tracking went well. They are going to take a while to analyze the data and so forth.
213:11:24 Scott: Okay. No problem, I was just a little curious.
213:11:27 Roosa: Roger. Understand. That is about all I can tell you now.
213:11:31 Scott: Okay. Well, we will see if we can't do it right again today.
213:11:35 Roosa: Today, with this procedure, you will be able to get a first hack at it, see how it goes.
213:11:41 Scott: Yes. It'll be very interesting.
213:11:46 Roosa: And I have the procedure that you will use to put in your factors in your W matrix and I could give you those anytime.
213:12:00 Scott: Okay. Can you stand by just one?
213:12:03 Roosa: Roger. Lots of time; I just thought if you wanted to take them now or anytime later.
This is Apollo Control. A final decision has not yet been made, but it's beginning to shape up at 152 dash 1, one revolution later then the original prime recovery zone and south of that zone. The weather is very good in that area. We expect a final decision shortly, but they say it's beginning to look more and more like we will go to 152 dash 1. If that decision is made, we will send the Guadalcanal toward that area very shortly. The recovery carrier is now halfway between 151 and 152 and we will be able to make either area by splash time tomorrow. Flight Director Frank has left his console. He has gone into a huddle with recovery, weathers and flight dynamics people. Flight Director Frank and his Orange Team will handle the re-entry tomorrow. That will...
213:13:56 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
213:13:57 Roosa: Go ahead, Apollo 9.
213:14:00 Scott: Okay, go ahead with your procedures for the P22. I'm ready to copy.
213:14:06 Roosa: Okay. Before and after you do P22, do a Verb 83 so we can get comparisons before and after.
213:14:18 Scott: Okay.
213:14:19 Roosa: Roger. Now we are going to load into the W matrix, and what the optical loads will do for you is give you a 10,000 foot and 10 feet per second. And this is what we want is a Verb 24, Noun 01 enter, 2000 and 4 enter, 137 enter, 762 enter.
213:14:58 Scott: Okay. Understand the W Matrix at 10,000 and 10, with a Verb 24, Noun 1 enter, 2004 enter, 137 enter, and 762 enter.
213:15:08 Roosa: Roger.
213:15:13 Roosa: And a Verb 83 before and after.
213:15:14 Scott: Roger. We'll get the Verb 83 before and after.
213:15:16 Roosa: Okay. Have fun.
213:15:18 Scott: Okay. We will also reset the 121 alarm and then set it afterwards. Okay?
213:15:24 Roosa: Yes, real good. And you still have the procedure you used yesterday, Dave?
213:15:28 Scott: Yes, I've got it. Thank you.
213:15:30 Roosa: Okay.
This is Apollo Control. The P22 that Stu Roosa has been discussing with the crew is the computer program used during the landmark tracking exercises.
213:17:52 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
213:17:54 Roosa: Go ahead, Apollo 9.
213:17:56 Scott: Hey, on the night pass before the landmark tracking, after we get through with the COAS calibration, how about another P52 to REFSMMAT to get the platform all tweaked up? Okay?
213:18:08 Roosa: Roger. That sounds real good.
213:18:10 Scott: Okay.
213:19:49 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, Houston. You have a Go all the way to 152 dash 1
213:19:58 McDivitt: Roger. Go to 152 dash 1. Very good.
This is Apollo Control; the decision has been made to go to 152-1, recovery area 152-1.
213:20:44 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston.
213:20:48 Scott: Houston, 9. Go.
213:20:49 Roosa: Okay, Dave. I just want to verify there again that we will do the P22 to the CSM vector that you have now, and that Verb 47 we will not do prior to P22.
213:21:04 Scott: Roger. We understand that.
213:21:06 Roosa: Okay.
213:21:11 Scott: You want us to do mode 66 now, or you just want to leave the other one in there?
213:21:17 Roosa: We are going to uplink you a good one before we start. I guess that's probably your choice.
213:21:25 Roosa: Just a second; Let's see what Guidance has to say about that.
213:21:54 Roosa: Okay, Apollo 9. Guidance said the same thing I did: your choice.
213:22:01 Scott: Okay.
TEXAS [REV 135 ]
This is Apollo Control; preliminary coordinates for 152-1; 23 degrees, 14 minutes north, 68 degrees west. And the preliminary deorbit time; 240 hours, 30 minutes, 8 seconds. That is the time for ignition of the deorbit burn for 152-1. That would be 10:30 Central Standard Time. About 30 minutes and 8 seconds past 10 days even in this mission. These numbers will be refined later; Retro is working on them now. As soon as we have the refined numbers, 400 K feet, and the chute times, we'll be back and give you those. Apollo 9's present orbit, 245 and one half nautical miles [454.6 km] apogee; 98 nautical miles perigee [181.5 km]. We'll continue to stand by during the stateside pass. This is Apollo Control; the bottom clock on the monitor identified as now counting to the new deorbit time. It's 27 hours, 4 minutes away.
213:25:47 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston.
213:25:50 Scott: Houston, 9; Go.
213:25:52 Roosa: Roger. We have made it official now. It will be 152 dash 1 and the time for ignition on my mark will be 27 hours and four minutes.
213:26:09 Roosa: MARK
213:26:17 Scott: Okay. We got that.
213:26:19 Roosa: Okay.
213:26:23 Scott: Looks like it's 240:30:09.
213:26:34 Roosa: Well, that's pretty close. It's really 08.
213:26:40 Scott: By George! I knew we'd miss something.
213:26:45 Roosa: You did good work.
CANARY [REV 135 ]
This is Apollo Control. Apollo 9 is in acquisition with the Canary station. We will continue to stand by for any air-to-ground.
213:41:21 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston.
213:41:25 Schweickart: Roger, Houston. Go ahead.
213:41:27 Roosa: Roger. We're showing Quad Charlie is approaching the switch-over point there, and if it switches over, we would like you to go back and use BD roll and disable AC roll. Over.
213:41:44 Schweickart: Okay. We'll keep an eye on it. We will go to BD roll, and you still want us to use the BC quads, right?
213:41:52 Roosa: That is affirmative.
213:41:55 Schweickart: Okay.
CARNARVON [REV 135 ]
This is Apollo Control at 213 hours, 42 minutes. Canaries has Loss of Signal. Tananarive will acquire at 213 hours, 54 minutes. During this pass over the United States, a decision was made to extend this flight one revolution. The prime recovery now 152 dash 1, Apollo 9 landing early in the 157th revolution. Deorbit time for this new landing zone, 240 hours, 30 minutes, 8 seconds. The coordinates, we're showing right now - these will be refined through the day after continued tracking - preliminary coordinates: 20 degrees, 14 minutes north latitude; 68 degrees west longitude. The weather in this area is good and the recovery carrier U.S.S. Guadalcanal has started speeding toward this area and will be in the area. That deorbit time again is 240 hours, 30 minutes, 8 seconds. That's the time for ignition for Service Propulsion burn number 8, the deorbit burn. We do not yet have an estimated splash time. Get that to you as soon as we do. Also during this last pass over the United States, Apollo 9 continued with the photography, getting some weather pictures on the Georgia coast and some oceanography photographs of the Bermuda area. This is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 213 hours, 54 minutes; and Tananarive is acquiring Apollo 9.
This is Apollo Control at 214 hours, 03 minutes. Tananarive has Loss of Signal. Next station to acquire will be Carnarvon at 214 hours, 09 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 214 hours, 09 minutes. Apollo 9 is coming within range of Carnarvon now.
214:10:12 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon. And I have an S065 PAD for you.
214:10:19 Scott: Roger. Stand by just one.
214:10:22 Roosa: Roger
214:10:24 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
214:10:26 Roosa: Houston. Go.
214:10:28 Scott: We tried taking a couple of photographs through the sextant here, and we took five of them. I don't know how they are going to come out, but we just thought we'd advise you.
214:10:38 Roosa: Okay. Real good.
214:11:04 Scott: Okay, Houston. Go ahead with the S065 PAD
214:11:07 Roosa: Okay. Inertial angles, 18000 26200; yaw, all zips; 214:55:26, 216:10:00. You will be orb-rate and your Victor through Zulu are the same as yesterday. First sight is Wilmington at 215:00:26 20 03. Over.
214:12:04 Scott: Roger. 18000, 26200, all zips, 214:55:26. 216:10:00 orb-rate. Wilmington, 215:00:26 20 03.
214:12:25 Roosa: Roger. Your readback is correct.
214:13:23 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, Houston. I have about seven targets of opportunity here. That'll take care of it for the day, I think.
214:13:31 Scott: Okay. Just a minute.
214:14:28 Scott: Okay, Houston. Go ahead and give us the time first.
214:14:30 Roosa: Roger. 214:51:30, seven frames, 26 seconds, on track; it's Mexico, geology. At time, 214:54:46, three frames, 24 seconds, It's north 60 degrees, Rocky Mountains, geology. At time 214:56:17, three frames, 22 - second interval, south 30 degrees, College Station, Texas, weather. At time 215:21:05, four frames, 20 seconds, north 45 degrees, Gulf of Guinea, weather. At time 216:31:06, four frames, eight seconds, on track, high plains, Lubbock, Texas, geology. At time 216:43:06, 18 frames, 20 seconds, on track, that's BOMEX, weather. 217:02:12, 9 frames, 20 seconds, north 60 degrees, Cape Fria, southwest Africa, weather. And that ought to do it for the day.
214:17:22 Scott: Okay. Just a minute.
214:17:25 Roosa: And we'll have S-band volume up at 19.
214:17:30 Scott: Roger. S - band up at 19.
214:17:33 Scott: Okay. 214:51:30, seven frames, 26 seconds, on track, Mexico, geology. At time, 214:54:46, three frames, 24 seconds, north 60 degrees, Rocky Mountains, geology. 214:56:17, three frames, 22 seconds, south 30 degrees, College Station, weather. 215:21:05, four frames, 20 seconds, north 45 degrees, Gulf of Guinea, weather.

214:18:34 Roosa: Roger. And that BOMEX weather is on track.
214:18:40 Scott: Okay.
214:18:44 Roosa: And that's Cape Fria, F-R-I-A, in Africa.
214:18:49 Scott: Okay. Fine.
214:34:45 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. One minute LOS; HI. 39.
HAWAII [REV 135 ]
This is Apollo Control. The Wilmington referred to in the S065 photography experiment update is Wilmington, North Carolina.
And to review the photographic targets of opportunity for the day - Mexico, geology; Rocky Mountains, geology; College Station, Texas, weather; Gulf of Guinea, weather; the high plains around Lubbock, Texas, geology and the area referred to as BOMEX - that stands for Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment. This is a joint experiment of NASA DOD and the Environmental Science Services Administration. It's in the Barbados Island area, and Cape Fria, southwest Africa, weather. We have overlapping coverage here between Honeysuckle and the tracking ship Huntsville. We'll continue to stand by.
This is Apollo Control at 214 hours, 36 minutes. Huntsville has Loss of Signal; Apollo 9 will be within range of the Hawaii station in about 3 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo at 214 hours and 39 minutes, and Hawaii has acquisiton of Apollo 9.
214:39:55 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston through Hawaii.
214:39:59 McDivitt: Roger. This is Apollo 9. Go.
214:40:01 Roosa: Roger. Will have you now all the way up until about 10 minutes after the hour.
214:40:06 McDivitt: Oh; very good.
TEXAS [REV 136 ]
This is Apollo Control at 214 hours, 59 minutes. Apollo 9 over the United States now within range of both the Texas and the Merritt Island, Florida, stations. The crew busy getting set up for the multispectral terrain photography. There has been no air to ground yet, during this pass over the United States. We will continue to stand by and monitor.
This is Apollo Control. Apollo 9's cabin pressure is holding at 4.9 pounds per square inch and we are showing a cabin temperature of 68 degrees Farenheit.
215:01:47 Schweickart: Houston, Apollo 9.
215:01:50 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
215:01:53 Schweickart: Roger. Could you brief me on what we are going to do with the S065 on the next pass?
215:03:47 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston.
215:03:49 Schweickart: Go ahead. Houston, 9.
215:03:52 Roosa: Okay. On the S065, there will be taken some - about seven pictures over the US, about 40 of them over the BOMEX area, and then we will pitch up and empty the cameras on the horizon. We will pass up the angles and this good deal stuff up to you.
215:04:08 Scott: Very well.
215:04:10 Schweickart: Okay. Very good. I was very afraid you might have some film left.
215:04:13 Roosa: No, We are going to use it all. As a matter of fact, we will run up before we pitch up, I think, on one of the cameras, but we will just use the other cameras on the - out on the horizon.
215:04:21 Schweickart: Okay. Very good.
CARNARVON [REV 136 ]
This is Apollo Control at 215 hours, 11 minutes. The tracking ship Vanguard in the Atlantic reports Loss of Signal. The Canary Island station will acquire within about a minute and a half. At the crew's request, we passed up some general information on the last S065 run, the multi spectral terrain photography which will be performed during the next revolution. We are now in the 136th revolution, the last part of this experiment will be performed during the last part of this revolution and the beginning of the 137th. We will pass up the detailed information to the crew probably over the Carnarvon station on this revolution. Generally, we're looking for 12 exposures of the southwestern United States, 7 over the state of Georgia, 40 over the Barbados area, referred to as BOMEX, standing for Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological and Experiment. We expect one of the cameras to run out of film during the BOMEX photography and then we'll ask Apollo 9 to pitch to the horizon and complete the film in the other cameras with photographs of the horizon. The Canaries station has acquired now. We will continue to stand by.
This is Apollo Control at 215 hours, 16 minutes. We've had Loss of Signal at the Canaries. The next station to acquire will be Tananarive at 215 hours, 30 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 215 hours, 30 minutes. Tananarive has acquired Apollo 9. This is Apollo Control at 215 hours, 39 minutes. Apollo 9 has gone through this Tananarive pass without voice communication. The next station to acquire will be Carnarvon at 215 hours, 45 minutes. Apollo 9 entered the nightside of this 136th revolution during the Tananarive pass. This is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 215 hours, 45 minutes. Apollo 9 coming up on the station at Carnarvon now.
215:48:08 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon.
215:48:12 McDivitt: Go ahead. Houston, Apollo 9.
215:48:15 Roosa: Roger. We'd like to get a little more information on Quad Delta switchover; so if you could, use quads Charlie Delta for attitude control, right bravo Charlie.
215:48:33 Schweickart: Okay. You want us to go with Charlie Delta now?
215:48:35 Roosa: Affirmative. Charlie Delta for attitude control, continue with Bravo Delta rule.
215:48:52 Schweickart: Okay; check. Here it is: Baker Delta 4 roll.
215:48:56 Roosa: Roger. Baker Delta for role when you switch over.
215:49:03 Schweickart: Wait, a second, now. Do you want me to stay in Bravo Charlie now or do you want me to go to Charlie Delta now?
215:49:13 Roosa: Roger. We'd like to go to Charlie Delta now for attitude control. And then when you switch over, go to BD for roll.
215:49:24 Schweickart: Okay.
215:51:31 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. I have two S065 updates for you.
215:51:38 Scott: Okay. Stand by just one.
215:51:45 Scott: Okay. Go.
215:51:46 Roosa: Roger. 18000 27470, all zips; 216:23:00, 216:10:00. It'll be Orb-Rate. First site: southwest US, 216:27:15 20 15. Second site: GA, 216:34:40 20 07. third site: BOMEX, 216:40:43 20 33.
215:53:12 Schweickart: Houston, are you there?
215:53:14 Roosa: Roger. Go.
215:53:16 Schweickart: Okay. Ready for read back?
215:53:19 Roosa: Affirmative.
215:53:21 Schweickart: Okay. 18000 27400, all zips, 216:23:00, 216:10:00, orb-rate; southwest US, 216:27:15 20 15; Georgia, 216:34:40 20 07; BOMEX, 216:40:43 20 33.
215:54:00 Roosa: Roger, Houston. Let's verify your pitch inertial angle, 274.70.
215:54:08 Scott: Roger, 274.70.
215:54:12 Roosa: Okay. And now for this deplete in the film there. What we want are some pictures of the horizon to see if we can get these different shades of blue that were observed in the Gemini program, and I'll give you some orb-rate angles. I guess as soon as you finish up the last S065, just whip around in the Orb-Rate ball at these angles. I'll give you the time, Then you can deplete the film as soon as you get to the attitude.
215:54:44 McDivitt: Okay. Go.
215:54:46 Roosa: Okay. Your Orb-Rate ball angles will be 180.27 - belay that. Pitch will be 25.7; yaw, zero. Your time will be 217:03:00. and S-band band volume up for Honeysuckle.
215:55:18 McDivitt: Okay. You want me to read it back?
215:55:20 Roosa: Your site there will just be the horizon. Deplete film and 10 second intervals.
215:55:39 McDivitt: Okay. Ready, Houston?
215:55:40 Roosa: Affirmative. Go.
215:55:42 McDivitt: Okay. For the film depletion, we use orbit rate angles, pitch or roll will be 180.0, pitch 025.7, and yaw 000. The time will be 7:03:00. We put the cameras on horizon, take pictures at 10-second intervals until the film is all gone.
215:56:04 Roosa: Roger, and Jim were kind of short there. You'll probably be going into darkness right away, so as soon as you get the attitude, just go ahead and start taking the pictures.
215:56:17 McDivitt: Okay. We'll zip right up there.
215:56:20 Roosa: And I can give you some inertial angles if you want to check your orb-rate and things.
215:56:25 McDivitt: Okay. Fine. Go ahead.
215:56:26 Roosa: Roger. Inertial angles will be 180.00, 169.70, and yaw, zero.
HONEYSUCKLE [REV 136 ]
215:57:47 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. I think we have good two way lock, now.
215:57:51 McDivitt: Okay, Ron. I get the 180 but I didn't get the pitch.
215:57:54 Evans: Okay. The pitch will be 169.70 and yaw, zero.
215:58:02 McDivitt: Okay. The inertial angles are 180.0., 169.7., and 00000.
215:58:09 Evans: Roger. And those inertial angles will be good at 217 03 00.
215:58:14 McDivitt: Okay.
215:58:49 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Approaching LOS. Possibility, no voice, Honeysuckle 01; if not, Hawaii at 13.
215:59:00 McDivitt: Okay. Understand you might get us at Honeysuckle and you may not, and Hawaii at 13.
215:59:05 Evans: Roger.
215:59:25 Schweickart: Houston, Apollo 9. what's the first gyro torquing angle?
215:59:32 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Say again.
HUNTSVILLE [REV 136 ]
216:01:31 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Huntsville.
216:02:39 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Huntsville.
216:03:48 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston
This is Apollo Control at 216 hours, 7 minutes. It doesn't appear likely that we are going to have much success in establishing communications through Huntsville. Hawaii will acquire at 216 hours, 12 minutes. We'll take the circuit down now. If we do have air-to-ground in the remaining couple of minutes at the Huntsville we will come back up. This is Mission Control, Houston.
216:10:17 COMM TECH Huntsville: Apollo 9, this is Huntsville. Over.
216:10:20 Scott: Hello there, Huntsville. This is Apollo 9. How are you today?
216:10:21 COMM TECH Huntsville: Just fine, Apollo 9. Our HF link through Houston is out at this time. Could I take any message for relay once we get these links back in?
216:10:32 Scott: I don't believe so. Tell them we're preparing to do S065, and everything else is okay.
216:10:36 COMM TECH Huntsville: Roger; will do.
216:10:46 McDivitt: Huntsville, how are you doing down there?
216:10:48 COMM TECH Huntsville: Apollo 9, Huntsville. We're doing fine now, other than our comm at times is pretty bad here on the HF link.
216:10:57 McDivitt: We certainly appreciate all the help you guys have given us during the flight.
216:11:00 COMM TECH Huntsville: Roger; thank you.
216:11:04 McDivitt: Okay. Get some of that good sun for us, will you?
216:11:06 COMM TECH Huntsville: Roger. We have down [garble] pretty close to the equator. It's pretty warm.
216:11:13 McDivitt: Yes, I know. I wish we had some of it up here.
216:11:15 COMM TECH Huntsville: Well, you should be closer to it.
216:11:21 McDivitt: I hadn't thought about it that way.
HAWAII [136 ]
This is Apollo Control at 216 hours, 12 minutes. Hawaii has acquired Apollo 9. There was some brief conversation just before LOS at Huntsville between Apollo 9 crew and the Huntsville. We could not read it here; we could tell that they were talking to the ship. We'll turn that tape over to the transcript; we'll stand by for any conversation at Hawaii
216:13:40 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
216:13:42 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
216:13:45 Scott: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 9.
216:13:46 Evans: Roger. I'll take your torquing angles now if you want to.
216:13:52 Schweickart: Roger. Stand by.
216:13:55 Evans: Okay.
216:14:05 Schweickart: Okay. GET: some of this is Okay. 215:40:00, plus 00134, minus 00017, minus 00105.
216:14:23 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Roger. We copy.
216:14:26 Schweickart: Okay.
216:14:27 Evans: And I think I left you with the idea that the depletion on that S065 was pointed right at the horizon. Actually, the camera should be pointed 15 degrees below the horizon.
216:14:42 Schweickart: Okay.
This is Apollo Control at 216 hours, 29 minutes. The crew of Apollo 9 busy with photographic tasks during this pass over the United States, performing both the S-065 experiment and several photographic targets of opportunity.
216:30:41 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
216:30:44 Scott: Roger. Go.
216:30:45 Evans: Roger. We had a little problem there in semantics with the scientists. Your orb rate pitch angle for the depletion thing is really 040.7. The cameras are pointing at the horizon, and your inertial pitch angle will be 184.7.
216:31:19 Scott: Roger. Orb-Rate, 040 .7; inertial, 184.7.
216:31:24 Evans: Roger.
216:31:27 Scott: Okay
TEXAS [REV 137 ]
216:43:20 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. One minute LOS; Ascension at 51.
216:43:20 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston, 1 minute LOS, Ascension at 51.
216:43:25 Schweickart: Roger. Okay, Houston. We are busily snapping pictures for you.
216:43:29 Evans: Real good.
216:43:31 Schweickart: The States were really clear that time; we ought to really have some nice ones.
216:43:35 Evans: Okay, that's what we like to hear.
216:43:42 Schweickart: Trouble is, we're supposed to be taking pictures of the weather out here, and the ocean is clear as a bell.
216:43:45 Evans: Well, oceanographers will be happy, then.
216:43:49 Schweickart: Yes, just as long as we have the cameras pointing down, we're pleasing somebody.
216:43:55 Evans: Okay.
ASCENSION [REV 137 ]
This is Apollo Control at 216 hours, 44 minutes and Antigua has LOS. Apollo 9 will be within range of the Ascension Island station at 216 hours, 51 minutes. This is Mission Control Houston.
216:44:26 Scott (onboard): Yes, this is one coming up here on the - to the south of those [garble].
216:45:54 Schweickart (onboard): Look at the little white stuff going around you [garble].
216:50:09 Schweickart (onboard): Two burns and two turns. [Garble].
216:50:16 Schweickart (onboard): That's going to be an interesting strip of weather film, though.
216:52:14 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through ascension. Standing by.
216:52:19 McDivitt: Roger.
216:52:22 Evans: Roger. Loud and clear.
216:52:25 McDivitt: Excuse me, I think I cut you out. Say again.
216:52:28 Evans: That's all right. You're pitching out, but we got it.
216:52:31 McDivitt: Okay.
This is Apollo Control at 216 hours, 53 minutes and Apollo 9 is within range of Ascension.
216:54:30 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
216:54:30 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
216:54:34 Scott: Go ahead.
216:54:35 Evans: Roger. It looks like we are going to get a pretty good tracking target on the ascent stage this evening. It's - the closest point of approach will be 222 hours and about 41 minutes. It's about an hour into your rest. There, but we plan to let you sleep an hour in the morning and kind of wonder what you thought about this.
216:54:59 McDivitt: Sure. We'd like to track it.
216:55:01 Evans: Okay. Real good. It looks like we'll go ahead and work it into the Flight Plan there and update you a couple of state vectors. Both the CSM and the LM. Range will be out about 690 miles, and we'll give you some gimbal angles to point the optics out of. We'll take a few marks, and then we'll make a vector compare on it.
216:55:23 McDivitt: Great.
216:55:25 Scott: Very good.
216:55:32 Evans: And we are tracking the ascent stage by a C-band radar and skin track, so that's where we are getting our vector.
216:55:41 McDivitt: Okay. How did that ascent stage hold up after we got out of it?
216:55:46 Evans: Beautiful. The commander's bus went down in about seven hours, I think.
216:56:12 Evans: Oh, By the way, the lighting looks like it's going to be about perfect for this tracking thing, too
216:56:18 McDivitt: Okay.
Comm break.
216:58:00 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston
216:58:02 McDivitt: Go ahead.
216:58:03 Evans: Roger it looks like when you finish your landmark tracking there, what we plan to do is set you up in a PTC mode, and we'll update the stuff for you here later on. But just keep it in the PTC mode, then you can go ahead and get kind of squared away in there. We'll stay in PTC. Until we start on the tracking of the limb.
216:58:27 McDivitt: Okay. We can get set ourselves up in 30 to 40 degree deadband hold to keep it out of gimbal lock, And that's what you want.
216:58:35 Evans: No. We really want the data on the PTC with the DAP driving it so we can get an idea on the fuel and pressure operations, and what have you.
216:58:46 McDivitt: Okay. What kind of pitch on your deadband are you looking for?
216:58:51 Evans: Roger. It'll be 20 degrees.
This is Apollo Control at 216 hours, 59 minutes. Apollo 9 is out of range at Ascension. Ron Evans advising the crew, during this pass, that we'd like to try to attempt to optically track the ascent stage of the Lunar Module - roughly six hours from now. Elapsed time of 222 hours, 41 minutes. At that time, the ascent stage of the LM will be at a range of 690 miles from the Command Service Module. We'd like to track it through the optics, take marks, and then compare the onboard vectors with the vectors that we are getting here on the ground through C-band radar skin tracking the ascent stage. We'll have good lighting for this tracking attempt. It will come on the Gold Team of flight controllers shift. Gene Kranz and his White Team will be on an hour later tonight. They are due to break shift at 4 pm Central Standard Time. The Gold Team will come on for a nine hour shift and then the Orange Team will come on and handle re-entry of Apollo 9 tomorrow morning. PTC reference in this conversation over Ascension is Passive Thermal Control. During the next several sights we will be passing up additional information to the crew for this attempt to track the Lunar Module ascent stage. Tananarive will acquire Apollo 9 at 217 hours, 7 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.
216:59:06 Evans: I think so, but we will get you over Tananarive, if not there, Carnarvon.
216:59:14 McDivitt: Okay. How about checking into that, Will you, please?
216:59:16 Evans: Okay.
CARNARVON [REV 137 ]
This is Apollo Control at 217 hours, 07 minutes and Tananarive has acquired Apollo 9.
This is Apollo Control at 217 hours, 15 minutes. Tananarive has Loss of Signal. Carnarvon will be the next station to acquire at 217 hours, 21 minutes. This is Mission Control Houston.
217:22:09 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon, I have a landmark tracking update.
217:22:16 McDivitt: OK, Houston. We'll be ready for the landmark tracking update in a minute. But before you send us that data, be advised that we went into the darkness taking a picture of the dark horizon rather than the sunlit horizon; our plan is to continue around and finish up by taking picture of the sunrise, if that's OK with you, period. Now, go ahead with your update.
217:22:42 Evans: Okay. That's fine with us.
217:23:00 Scott: And we're ready to copy the update.
This is Apollo Control at 217 hours, 23 minutes. Carnarvon has acquired Apollo 9.
217:23:04 Evans: Okay. Update follows. Landmark ID: 005, 217:59:15 00; on down to TCA time, 218:03:13 00; north 30 miles. Next one: ID: 065, 218:10:38 00; TCA time, 218:14:05 00 and is north 30 miles. Over. That's a mess.
217:24:09 Scott: Okay. 005, 217:59:15 00, 218:03:13 00, 10 miles north. 065, 218:10:38 00, 218:14:05 00, north 30 miles.
217:24:33 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Your readback correct.
217:24:42 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Can you give us P00 and Accept there shortly for a state vector uplink?
217:24:52 Schweickart: Roger. As soon as we torque these angles, you can probably copy them down now.
217:24:59 Evans: Roger. We have them.
217:25:08 Schweickart: Okay. We'll be torquing at 217:25:30.
217:25:14 Evans: Roger.
217:26:07 Scott: Houston, 9.
217:26:09 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
217:26:11 Scott: Did you want the numbers from the COAS calibration now, or do you just want them recorded for later?
217:26:18 Evans: If you have them, then go ahead and get them.
217:26:22 Scott: Okay. I can give you - You've got POO and Accept now, by the way
217:26:28 Evans: Roger.
217:26:30 Scott: I can give you the ones I did on the rendezvous day, and then I did two today for repeatability if you want to copy them down.
217:26:37 Evans: Roger. Go.
217:26:39 Scott: Okay. The first one was on day 5: 35974 57167.
217:26:50 Evans: Roger. Copy.
217:26:52 Scott: Okay. And here are the two for today: 35981 57239, 35977 57296.
217:27:06 Evans: Roger. We copy.
217:27:09 Scott: Okay.
217:28:11 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
217:28:15 Scott: Go ahead, Houston.
217:28:17 Evans: Roger. If you can get it in there prior to P22, we'd like you to do a Verb 83 and copy down R, R dot, and Theta; And then also hit a Verb 83 after you've completed P22.
217:28:35 McDivitt: Okay.
217:29:22 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
217:29:25 Evans: Go.
217:29:27 Scott: One other question: When you get around to having us track the ascent stage, are you going to do anything on the W matrix?
217:29:39 Evans: Roger. Standby.
217:30:08 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
217:30:11 Scott: Houston, 9. Go.
217:30:12 Evans: Roger. The computer is yours. You have a good state vector of the LM slot and a deteriorated one in the CSM slot.
217:30:23 Scott: Okay. We'll plan to use the CSM slot for the updating on landmark tracking, And then we'll take a look after that.
217:30:30 Evans: Roger. And we're still ginning up the procedure for that. For that tracking thing. We'll let you know on the W matrix.
217:30:39 McDivitt: Okay; very well.
This is Apollo Control. The identification on those landmark tracking areas, number 5 is Santa Catalina Island
217:32:24 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Will see you at Guam at 36.
217:32:29 Schweickart: Roger, Guam 36.
HAWAII [REV 138 ]
This is Apollo Control at 217 hours, 33 minutes. Carnarvon has Loss of Signal. Guam will acquire at 217 hours, 35 minutes. The identification of those landmark tracking areas: 005 is Santa Catalina Island off the coast of California, 065 is the north tip of Point Quest, q - u - e - s - t, Tortue Island, Haiti - that's T - o - r - t - u - e. We have an updated deorbit time from the Retrofire Officer of 240 hours, 31 minutes, 30 seconds. Projected time for reaching 400,000 feet, 240 hours, 44 minutes, 22 seconds. 05 g, 240 hours, 46 minutes, 50 seconds. Begin blackout at 240 hours, 47 minutes, 21 seconds. End blackout, 240 hours, 50 minutes, 45 seconds. Drogue chute deploy, 240 hours, 55 minutes, 5 seconds. Main chute deploy, 240 hours, 55 minutes, 53 seconds. Projected splash time, 241 hours, 0 minutes, 48 seconds. The coordinates of the aim point have not changed. They are 23 degrees, 14 minutes north; 68 degrees west. The coordinates for the 400,000-foot mark are 32 degrees, 25 minutes north, 98 degrees, 21 minutes west. That's in the Fort Worth/Dallas area, a little west of that area. This is Mission Control, Houston.
Guam has acquisition. This is Apollo Control at 217 hours, 44 minutes. Apollo 9 out of range at Guam. Hawaii will acquire at 217 hours, 49 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 217 hours, 49 minutes. Apollo 9 is within range of the Hawaii station.
217:49:34 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Standing by through Hawaii.
217:49:38 McDivitt: Roger. Houston, Apollo 9. We are coming around to tracking attitude. And be advised we took some pictures of the sunrise. We only had two cameras running when we started and 1 ran out after about 3 or 4 frames, So we finished up with the other camera.
217:49:52 Evans: Roger.
217:53:52 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Check your gimbal there.
217:53:56 McDivitt: Roger. Houston, Apollo 9. Thank you.
217:55:14 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Just a little reminder on that W Matrix Update.
217:55:21 McDivitt: Go ahead with your reminder.
217:55:24 Evans: Okay. To update the W matrix, change it to 10,000 feet and 10 feet per second; that we talked over this morning.
217:55:35 McDivitt: Roger. That's in work.
217:55:37 Evans: Okay. Good.
MILA [REV 138 ]
218:05:36 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
218:05:39 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
218:05:41 Scott: Roger. There's a little low deck of clouds over the first landmark, so we will have to try another one.
218:05:48 Evans: Okay. Can't get them all, I guess.
218:05:52 Scott: Everything else looks pretty good inland, but there is a little low deck of stratus out there.
218:05:57 Evans: Roger. Understand.
This is Apollo Control. That was Dave Scott explaining they could not do the landmark tracking exercise over Catalina Island because of clouds. The next opportunity comes down over Haiti.
ANTIGUA [REV 138]
This is Apollo Control. The Antigua station has acquisition of Apollo 9. Apollo 9 flying over the Caribbean area. Perhaps shortly we will get a report on this second attempt of landmark tracking today.
218:17:42 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. About 2 minutes LOS, and I have your PTC procedures, and I will give them as Flight Plan updates.
218:18:15 Schweickart: Okay. Ready to copy your PTC updates.
218:18:19 Evans: Roger. Perform CMP, page 3-17, 4 plus 0.1 degrees per second. Your initial attitude: roll, zero; pitch, 231.7; yaw, zero.
218:18:52 Schweickart: Okay. Is that it, Ron?
218:18:53 Evans: Negative. Do step seven at 218 plus 35 plus 00; at 218 plus 40 plus 00, change DAP deadband 2 plus or minus 10 degrees. I think you have that procedure on page about 327, your CMP checklist.
218:19:31 Scott: Right.
218:19:39 Scott: Anything else?
218:19:41 Evans: Roger. Just about every Rev thereafter, we are going to want to try a different deadband. We will try to get 20 degrees and then 25 degrees. We will give you a call on those.
218:19:48 Scott: Okay. Understand to perform - The procedure then is to perform the CMP 317 for plus 0.1 degrees per second. In [garble] attitude [garble] 231.7, 0. Do Step 7 at 218:35:00; and 218:35:00; and 218:40:00, change the DAP deadband to plus or minus 10 degrees.
This is Apollo Control at 218 hours, 20 minutes. Antigua has Loss of Signal. Ascension will acquire Apollo 9 at 218 hours, 27 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.
218:20:10 Evans: Affirmative. And you will be kind of on your own. Now you can do any housekeeping things you want to do and we will update you for the tracking procedure here a little later on.
218:20:30 McDivitt: Roger. Stand by for some [garble] where we're gonna put all this stuff?
ASCENSION [REV 138 ]
This is Apollo Control at 218 hours, 27 minutes. Apollo 9 being acquired at Ascension.
218:28:52 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston Ascension. Standing by.
218:28:57 Scott: Roger.
218:28:59 Evans: Roger. Loud and clear.
218:29:04 Scott: Hey, Houston, 9.
218:29:05 Evans: Apollo 9. Go.
218:29:08 Scott: Hey, I guess that data isn't going to be much good to you on landmark tracking; There were clouds down there, and I marked at a wrong target.
218:29:17 Evans: That ought to give us a pretty good error, anyhow,
218:29:20 Scott: Yes, it ought to really give you a good error.
218:29:22 Evans: Okay.
218:29:23 Scott: Took a Stratus back there - and the prime one - There was one that looked like the prime one, and just missed it.
218:29:31 Evans: You may have to break the spaceflight, I guess.
218:29:33 Scott: Yes, I can give you latitude and longitude of a good one.
218:29:37 Evans: Okay. Let's use that one.
218:29:41 Scott: Okay. Stand by.
218:29:52 Evans: Is this the one you tracked?
218:29:56 Scott: Roger. Stand by and I'll give you latitude and longitude; Maybe you can put it together.
218:29:59 Evans: Okay. That'll help us.
This is Apollo Control at 218 hours, 34 minutes. Apollo 9 out of range at Ascension. Acquisition time at Tananarive: 218 hours, 43 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.
218:34:10 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. 30 seconds LOS; Tananarive 44; if not there, Carnarvon 59.
218:34:20 Scott: Roger. Tananarive 44, Carnarvon on 59.
CARNARVON [REV 138 ]
This is Apollo Control at 218 hours, 43 minutes. Tananarive has acquired Apollo 9.
This is Apollo Control at 218 hours, 51 minutes and Tananarive has Loss of Signal. The Carnarvon station will pick up Apollo 9 at 218 hours, 58 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 218 hours, 58 minutes; Carnarvon is acquiring Apollo 9.
218:59:07 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Carnarvon standing by.
218:59:12 McDivitt: Roger. Houston, Apollo 9.
218:59:14 Evans: Roger. Loud and clear, Jim.
218:59:30 Scott: Houston, 9.
218:59:33 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
218:59:35 Scott: Okay. Let me give you the latitude and longitude of the point that we marked on our last pass, and maybe you can make some good out of the data you got. Okay?
218:59:44 Evans: Hey, very fine; We can use it.
218:59:47 Scott: Okay. I'm sure you can figure out what the point is when I give you the numbers. It's latitude is 19.815, longitude is 73.416.
219:00:03 Evans: Roger. 19.815. and 73.416.
219:00:08 Scott: Roger. And it's on the western tip of Haiti, there.
219:00:13 Evans: Roger.
219:00:15 Scott: And, surprisingly enough, the 0689 numbers that came up out of the computer were pretty close
219:00:24 Evans: Well, amazing! Real good. Thank you.
219:00:27 Scott: Yes, sort of like it identified as unknown landmark and then made it known, and figured out where it was; It did a pretty good job.
GUAM [REV 138 ]
This is Apollo Control at 219 hours, 5 minutes; Carnarvon has LOS. Guam will acquire Apollo 9 at 219 hours, 10 minutes. This is Mission Control Houston.
This Apollo Control at 219 hours 10 minutes, Apollo 9 coming up on Guam
219:13:38 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Guam.
219:13:41 Scott: Roger, Houston.
219:13:44 Evans: Roger, Dave your best admirer and two little ones are watching you whip across the world here, now.
219:13:50 Scott: Say again
219:13:52 Evans: I say your best admirer and two little ones are watching you whip across the world.
219:13:56 Scott: Oh, very good. Say hello to them for me.
219:14:00 Evans: You're saying it.
219:14:14 Scott: As a matter of fact tell them I'll be there for Chow in a couple of days.
219:14:19 Evans: She's nodding.
219:15:27 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
219:15:30 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
219:15:32 Scott: For your information, right now, we are demonstrating how to take out and remove the centre couch at 0G in order to fill, I guess, one of the last DTO'S.
219:15:41 Evans: Real fine. Any problems at all with it?
219:15:44 Scott: Oh no; It's real easy. As a matter of fact, it's easier than it is down there.
219:15:49 Evans: That's what we were hoping.
219:15:51 Scott: We'll have some movies if Cecil B. McDivitt and this other fellow here can come out with the right production scenes.
219:16:01 Evans: Mighty fine.
219:16:03 Scott: What we really need are a couple of good editors.
219:16:06 Evans: That's for sure, probably.
219:16:39 Evans: 9, Houston. PTC is looking real good so far. We'll see what happens when you come up perigee here.
219:16:46 Scott: Okay. Let us know when you want us to change deadbands.
219:16:49 Evans: Will do
219:20:00 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Hawaii at 27.
This is Apollo Control at 219 hours, 20 minutes. Apollo 9 is out of range at Guam moving over the Pacific toward Hawaii. That station will acquire at 219 hours, 26 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.
219:20:05 Scott: Roger. Hawaii at 27.
REDSTONE [REV 138]
This is Apollo Control at 219 hours, 26 minutes. Apollo 9 is within range of Hawaii.
This is Apollo Control at 219 hours, 33 minutes. Hawaii has Loss of Signal, however, Redstone will pick up here in about 30 seconds. The Flight Dynamics people are still working with these numbers in an attempt to track the ascent stage of the Lunar Module using the optics of the Command Service Module at about 222 hours, 40 minutes - roughly. As soon as all the information is assembled we'll pass that up to the crew.
219:36:05 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. I can give you the times to change DAP deadbands now.
219:36:16 McDivitt: Say again.
219:36:17 Evans: Roger. I can give you the times to change your DAP deadband.
219:36:22 McDivitt: Okay. You're coming through clear, now. Go ahead.
219:36:26 Evans: Roger. At 220 plus 10 plus 00, change DAP deadband to 20 degrees.
219:36:42 McDivitt: Roger. Understand. 220:10:00, DAP deadband to 20 degrees.
219:36:49 Evans: Roger. And at 221 plus 45 plus 00, change deadband to 25 degrees.
219:37:03 McDivitt: Roger. 221:45:00, deadband to 25 degrees.
219:37:08 Evans: Roger.
TEXAS [REV 139 ]
219:40:22 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. I'd like to talk a bit about your cryo plan for tonight.
219:40:30 Scott: Okay. Go ahead.
219:40:32 Evans: Roger. It's the same as last night, except your H2 tank pressure can go down to 180 to 200, and then we'll stir tank one fans tonight.
219:40:53 Scott: Okay. H2 tank pressure down to 160 or 200, and turn on tank one fan tonight.
219:40:59 Evans: Roger. Otherwise, it's the same as last night.
219:41:03 McDivitt: Okay. And we'll give a report when we get everything done.
219:41:06 Evans: OK
This is Apollo Control at 219 hours, 46 minutes. And the tracking station at Corpus Christi has LOS. Apollo 9 now in the orbits that sweep down across South America, missing all the tracking stations in the Eastern Test Range and in the Atlantic. The next station to acquire will be Tananarive at 220 hours, 19 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.
219:46:10 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Tananarive at 21.
219:46:41 McDivitt: Roger. TAN at 21.
TANANARIVE [REV 139 ]
This is Apollo Control. Dave Scott's wife and children are in the viewing room here at the Control Center listening to this conversation between Dave and CapCom Ron Evans.
This is Apollo Control at 220 hours, 19 minutes. Apollo 9 coming within range of Tananarive.
220:21:23 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Tananarive.
220:21:58 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Tananarive.
220:22:02 McDivitt: Go ahead. Houston, Apollo 9.
220:22:04 Evans: Roger. Do you read well enough for a Flight Plan update?
220:22:12 McDivitt: Roger. I believe so.
220:22:16 Evans: Roger. When you are ready.
220:22:29 McDivitt: Go ahead, Houston.
220:22:32 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. When you are ready, I will go with Flight Plan update.
220:22:39 McDivitt: Roger, Houston. Go ahead with the Flight Plan update.
220:22:43 Evans: Roger. 220 plus 48, block data; 221 plus 05, update state vectors; 222 plus 25, maneuver to ascent stage track attitude; 222 plus 50, power down IMU and SCS, terminate Batt A charge, waste water dump to 35 percent. I say again, 35 percent. Begin rest period. Over.
220:24:23 Schweickart: Okay. How do you read Apollo 9, Houston?
220:24:26 Evans: Roger. Pretty good now.
220:24:29 Schweickart: We missed where you said 220:48. Would you say that one again, please?
220:24:36 Evans: I'll send you block data.
220:24:44 Schweickart: Okay. 220:48, block data; 221:05, update state vectors; 222:25, maneuver to ascent stage track attitude; 222:50, power down IMU and SCS, terminate Batt A charge, waste water dump to 35 percent. Begin rest period. Over.
220:25:07 Evans: Roger. Your readback correct.
220:25:13 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9. what's the get-up time in the morning?
220:25:17 Evans: Roger. Your normal time on the Flight Plan was 232 plus 20, and we are thinking of making it 233 plus 35 or 233 plus 50. That's about seven and a half hours prior to Retro.
220:25:43 Schweickart: Roger understand it will be 233:35.
220:25:49 Evans: Affirmative.
GUAM [REV 139 ]
This is Apollo Control at 220 hours, 31 minutes. Apollo 9 is out of range at Tananarive. We had a Flight Plan update during this pass. Ask the crew to maneuver to the ascent stage tracking attitude at 222 hours, 25 minutes. We are still looking for the tracking of that LM ascent stage around 222 hours, 40 or 41 minutes. And Apollo 9 crew will power down the spacecraft at 222 hours, 50 minutes and begin their rest period. Get-up time in the morning - 233 hours, 35 minutes. The next station to acquire Apollo 9 will be Guam at 220 hours, 47 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 220 hours, 47 minutes. Apollo 9 in acquisition at Guam.
220:49:41 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Guam.
220:49:47 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9. Go.
220:49:49 Evans: Roger. I'll take your block data over Hawaii here. I'd like to talk over the P20 procedures now, if you want to copy.
220:49:58 Scott: Roger. Let me get a pencil.
220:50:11 Scott: Okay. Go ahead, Ron.
220:50:13 Evans: Okay. I'll give you the procedures about six - about six steps - and then I'll give you the dope on the ascent stage relative motion.
220:50:21 Scott: Roger. Ready to copy.
220:50:29 Evans: Okay. The first step is roll spacecraft to blank angle; I'll get that to you in a minute. Second one: select normal P20 procedures with auto maneuvers starting CMP page 4-1. Mark as long as desired at one-minute intervals, and update LM state vector. Time of closest approach, 222 plus one - belay that - I'll start again: 222 plus 41 plus 46. You can call P20 anytime prior to closest approach, but be careful of middle gimbal angle on Verb 50 Noun 18. If you call it too early, that middle gimbal angle may be greater than 60 degrees.
220:51:47 Scott: Roger
220:51:48 Evans: And your current W matrix initialization is okay. And basically, you can call P20 at 12 plus 35 plus 30, and range of about 1,000 miles at that time.
220:52:15 Scott: Okay.
220:52:17 Evans: Okay. Your initial role angle will be 345.6.
220:52:27 Scott: Okay. You ready for readback?
220:52:29 Evans: Okay. Go.
220:52:32 Scott: Okay. The roll angle for initial acquisition, 345.6, with an auto maneuver in P20 - normal P20 - mark at one minute intervals; time of closest approach 222:13:46; and P28 time prior to closest approach. We'll keep an eye on the middle gimbal angle. W matrix is okay, and the range is 1,000 miles at 222 [garble].
220:53:05 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Roger. Your readback is correct.
220:53:10 McDivitt: Okay. We'll give it a whirl.
220:53:12 Evans: Okay. I've got some more dope here at your point of closest approach, on it.
220:53:17 Scott: Yes, I was just going to ask you how close and that sort of thing.
220:53:24 Evans: Okay. Do you read me now - still?
220:53:27 Scott: Roger. Go.
220:53:29 Evans: Okay. The range will be 652 nautical miles, R-dot 32; CSM will be trailing 603 miles. You will be below 272 miles, and you'll be 117 miles to the right.
220:54:02 Scott: Okay. Understand. Closest approach. 652 miles, R-dot equals 32 is what I heard; CSM trailing 603 miles, below 272, to the right 117.
220:54:14 Evans: Roger. Your LM HA is 3741.7 by 127.8.
220:54:26 Scott: Roger. 3741.7 by 127.8
220:54:36 Scott: Hey, Ron, say again the R-dot at closest approach.
220:54:39 Evans: Roger. R-dot is 32 feet per second.
220:54:42 Scott: Okay. 32 feet per second.
220:54:46 Evans: It's a pretty slow pass through here also. Looks like you'll have about 10 to 15 minutes of tracking there.
220:54:52 Scott: Okay. Say again what you said just before the 10 to 15 minutes of tracking.
220:54:57 Evans: It goes pretty slow across the field of view.
This is Apollo Control at 220 hours, 55 minutes, and Guam has Loss of Signal. During this pass, Ron Evans updated the crew on computer procedures to be used during the tracking of the Lunar Module ascent stage. Advised the crew that 222 hours, 35 minutes, 30 seconds the range would be 1,000 miles between the two vehicles. The point of closest approach, GET of 222 hours, 41 minutes, 46 seconds. The range at that time 652 nautical miles. The range rate, 32 feet per second. At that time, the time of closest approach, the Command Module trailing the LM 603 nautical miles. Command Module below the LM 272 nautical miles, and the Command Module 117 miles to the right of the ascent stage. Hawaii acquires at 222 hours, 38 minutes, 46 seconds, during this pass on which the tracking will be attempted. Redstone acquisition 222 hours, 45 minutes, 19 seconds. If the crew acquires early they should have 10 to 15 minutes of tracking on the ascent stage. And the marks into the computer during the tracking at 1 minute intervals. The orbital parameters for these two vehicles at the present time: the Command and Service Module is in an orbit 245 by 98 nautical miles. The LM ascent stage: apogee is 3,741.7 nautical miles, perigee 127.8 nautical miles. Hawaii will acquire Apollo 9 next in this revolution at 221 hours, 3 minutes, approximately 4 minutes from now. This is Mission Control, Houston.
220:55:01 Scott: Okay. Does it go right to left or left to right or what?
220:55:05 Evans: It will be going left to right.
220:55:07 Scott: Okay. Thank you.
HAWAII [REV 139 ]
This is Apollo Control at 221 hours, 03 minutes. Apollo 9 approaching acquisition at Hawaii.
221:03:48 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
221:03:54 Schweickart: Roger, Houston. Stand by one.
221:03:58 Schweickart: Okay. We are ready to copy the block data.
221:04:01 Evans: I was afraid of that. I don't quite have it yet. Request P00 and Accept.
221:04:07 McDivitt: P00 and Accept we got.
221:04:10 Evans: Very well, And you won't quite have a Pegasus up there today. It's going to look like about a fourth magnitude star, we think, and my interpretation of the relative motion plot was wrong. The LM is going to be moving from your right to left, so the CSM will be yawing to the left.
221:04:39 Scott: Okay. Roger. Understand. Right to left and will be yawing to the left.
221:04:45 Evans: Affirmative.
221:04:49 Schweickart: Hey, when we get back, we'll have to talk about PTC and where we stopped it. We stopped it a couple of times now, and we'll get with you and get that all squared away. We have got the time.
221:05:00 Evans: Okay. Very fine. No problem.
221:05:10 Evans: 9, Houston. I have a Nav check. I can send up to you. This is an LM Nav check.
HAWAII [REV 139 ]
221:05:26 Scott: Okay. Go ahead.
221:05:28 Evans: Roger. Time 222:00:00, plus 0252, plus 11936 0228. Over.
221:05:56 Scott: We understand. 222:00:00, plus 0252, plus 11936 and 0228.
221:06:10 Evans: Roger. That is really at 3 000, 22.8, but the DSKY doesn't have room for it - or the PAD doesn't.
221:06:21 Scott: Okay.
221:07:23 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
221:07:24 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
221:07:26 Scott: Okay. There goes your uplink again. Your uplink was hung up there for a minute.
221:07:52 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. We've got a bit of in and out of keyhole there in Hawaii. If we don't quite get it, we'll finish it at Redstone. Redstone AOS is at 09.
REDSTONE [REV 139 ]
This is Apollo Control. Hawaii has Loss of Signal but Redstone will acquire in about 45 seconds. Over Hawaii Ron Evans informed the crew that the ascent stage should look about like a fourth magnitude star. He also told them that the ascent stage will be moving from Apollo 9 to right to their left.
221:10:34 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
221:10:37 Schweickart: Roger, Houston. Go ahead.
221:10:39 Evans: Roger. We had a couple of lines wrong there due to keyhole, so we'll line-by-line the CSM, then go straight up with the LM state vector.
221:10:48 Schweickart: Okay.
GOLDSTONE [REV 140 ]
221:12:37 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. The computer is yours.
221:12:41 McDivitt: Okay. Thank you.
221:12:44 Evans: Roger.
221:12:50 Evans: 9, Houston. How's your eyeball today?
221:12:55 Scott: Oh, it's pretty good.
221:13:00 Schweickart: We'll find that out about [garble].
221:13:03 Evans: We are counting on you.
221:13:07 Scott: I hope
221:13:09 McDivitt: Dave is telling me that maybe the tracking light is back on.
221:13:15 Evans: Yes, Roger.
GUAYMAS [REV 140 ]
221:13:23 Evans: 9, Houston. Super Retro has checked and checked and we are ready for block 22.
221:13:34 McDivitt: Okay. Tell super Retro to shoot.
221:13:37 Evans: Roger. 141 Charlie Charlie, plus 174, minus 1620 223:57:43 2834; 142 Charlie Charlie, plus 078, minus 1690 225:32:55 2832; 143 Charlie Charlie, plus 209, plus 1450 227:01:06 3913; 148 Charlie Charlie, minus 258, minus 1620 228:51:08 5825; 145 Alpha Charlie , plus 038, minus 0320 229:13:07 5534; 146 Alpha Charlie, plus 198, minus 0301 230:49:07 4539; 147 2 Alpha, plus 293, minus 0300 232:26:14 3813. Your pitch trim, minus 0.6 yaw, minus 0.94.
221:16:36 Schweickart: OK, Ron. What did we start with? 141 Charlie Charlie?
221:16:40 Evans: Affirmative.
221:16:42 Schweickart: Okay. Plus 174, minus 1620 223:57:43 2834; 142 Charlie Charlie, plus 078, minus 1690 225:32:55 2832; 143 Charlie Charlie, plus 209, plus 1450 227:01:06 3913 [garble].
221:17:12 Evans: Faster.
221:17:16 Schweickart: Are you still with us, Houston?
221:17:17 Evans: Affirmative. Faster.
221:17:19 Schweickart: Okay. 144 Charlie. Charlie, minus 258, minus 1620 228:51:08 5825; 145 Alpha Charlie, plus 038, minus 0320 229:13:07 5534; 146 Alpha Charlie, plus 198, minus 0301 230:49:07 4539; 147 2 alpha, plus 293, minus 0300 232:26:14 3813. Pitch trim, minus 0.64; yaw, minus 0.94
221:18:00 Evans: Roger. Your readback is correct.
221:18:05 Evans: 9, Houston.
TANANARIVE [REV 140 ]
221:12:557 Evans: Okay. Real well.
This is Apollo Control at 221 hours, 54 minutes and Tananarive has acquisition of Apollo 9.
Here in the Mission Control Center, the White Team is in the process of ending its last shift of this mission and handing over to the Gold Team. We're estimating the Change of Shift News Conference for 5:15 Central Standard Time.
221:58:57 Evans: Apollo 9. Houston through Tananarive.
221:59:04 McDivitt: Hello there, Houston; how are you?
221:59:06 Evans: Oh, Roger. Mighty fine. The White Team bids you Sayonara, and they will see you back at the ranch.
221:59:12 McDivitt: Hey, is the big White Director there?
221:59:16 Evans: Say again
221:59:24 McDivitt: Very good.
221:59:34 McDivitt: Houston, do you read Apollo 9?
221:59:37 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Loud and clear. How [garble]?
221:59:42 McDivitt: We're reading you. I'd like to thank - we'd all like to thank the White Team for all their efforts.
221:59:48 Evans: Roger. We appreciate it.
221:59:53 McDivitt: Tell that Flight Director that we still have that debriefing we've got to get with.
221:59:59 Evans: Okay. He copied.
222:00:20 McDivitt: Is that big White Flight Director there?
222:00:23 Evans: Affirmative. He's on the loop.
222:00:26 McDivitt: Okay. Tell him we better have that debriefing.
222:00:33 Evans: We concur and we will schedule it accordingly.
222:00:39 McDivitt: Tally Ho!
222:00:41 Evans: Roger.
HAWAII [REV 140 ]
This is Apollo Control at 222 hours, 6 minutes. Tananarive has Loss of Signal. The only conversation during this pass, Ron Evans telling the crew that the White Team would see them back here at the Manned Spacecraft Center. Jim McDivttt thanking the White Team and informing Gene Kranz, the Flight Director of the White Team, that he wanted to have a debriefing after the crew got back. And that's spelled p - a - r - t - y. This is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 222 hours, 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The Gold Team has replaced the White Team at this time. The White [SIC] Director is Gerry Griffin and the voice of CapCom, that is the astronaut who will be talking to the Apollo 9 crew, will be that of Al Worden. We are about some 11 minutes from acquisition at the Hawaii tracking station and it could very well be that prior to Hawaii acquisition, the crew of Apollo 9 will have begun to track the unmanned LM ascent stage. This is planned for this rev and the crew could pick up the LM as early as 222 plus 35, or two or three minutes before Hawaii acquisition. So, when they come into voice range, they may have acquired that unmanned LM and will have been in the process of tracking for some time. The tracking actually will consist of using onboard optics in an automatic mode which they will call Auto Optics. The point of closest approach will be at 222 plus 41 at which time the spacecraft, the Apollo 9 spacecraft, and the LM could be about 650 or so nautical miles apart. This entire track can take place between - over the Hawaii station as well as over the tracking ship Redstone. We also have our present tentative plans covering the return of the Apollo 9 crew to Houston after recovery sometime tomorrow. The plan, at the present time, reads something like this. Astronaut recovery, of course, will take place tomorrow and then the primary recovery ship, Guadalcanal, will steam toward Eleuthera Island in the Bahamas. The crew will remain on board the primary recovery ship overnight and after dawn, sometime after dawn, time to be determined, Friday morning which would make that March 14th, the Apollo 9 crew will leave the Guadalcanal and will fly via helo to Eleuthera Auxiliary Air Force Base. There a NASA Gulfstream aircraft will be standing by and after some 10 minutes or so, which is about all that is required to trans to helos to the Gulfstream, they will depart for a flight of about one hour and one-half duration to the skidstrip at Cape Kennedy. There, the Gulfstream will be refueled and following the refueling, then the aircraft will take off and head for Ellington Air Force Base for what we presently project as a Friday arrival here in Houston. At 222 hours, plus 31 minutes, with the spacecraft approaching the tracking station at Hawaii, this is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 222 hours, 38 minutes into the flight. In a matter of some 25, 26 seconds or so we should have acquisition at the Hawaii tracking station. The - on the scribing plotter board, that 10 foot by 20 foot board in front of us, we have both the images of the LM - although in this particular case it looks like the ascent stage, or sorry about that, the descent stage - and the image of the Command Service Module, which incidentally just turned green indicating that we have acquisition. Let's stand by to monitor the conversation.
222:40:11 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston.
222:40:15 McDivitt: Go ahead, Houston. This is Apollo 9.
222:40:18 Worden: Roger, just checking here with you. We'll be doing - asking you for your E - memory dump here at about 51.
222:40:27 McDivitt: Okay. Well, we're tracking the LM right now and [garble].
222:40:36 Worden: Okay. Understand. How's it going?
222:40:39 Schweickart: Okay. We've got it.
222:40:41 Worden: Very good.
222:40:45 Worden: Lot of smiles around here.
222:40:49 Scott: It's 40 46.
222:41:16 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston.
222:41:19 McDivitt: Go ahead, Houston.
222:41:20 Worden: Roger. We can let the E memory dump go if you get in a time bind, tracking the ascent stage, there. We would like you to turn Batt A charge off now, though.
222:42:05 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9. Say again; I missed that.
222:42:09 Worden: OK, Jim. We can let the E memory dump go if you get involved tracking the ascent stage, but we would like you to turn Batt A charge off now.
222:42:20 McDivitt: Okay. Battery A charge is Off now.
222:42:22 Worden: Alrighty.
Comm break.
222:44:57 Worden: 9, Houston. We are watching the marks and they're looking good.
222:45:01 McDivitt: Say again, please.
222:45:03 Worden: Roger. We are checking the marks as they come in, and they are looking good.
222:45:07 McDivitt: OK.
REDSTONE [REV 140 ]
When Astronaut McDivitt reported that the crew was tracking the upper stage of the Lunar Module there was a momentary cry here in Mission Control of somewhat exaltation with Gene Kranz, who is the White Team Flight Director, crying out "Three out of three" with some degree of joy, some element of joy and happiness. Meaning, of course, that this was the third successful attempt at tracking a piece of space debris out of three tries. Yesterday we attempted twice to track Pegasus and were successful, and of course, today we attempted once to track the LM upper stage and had some success. We did not, however, have much success on our third attempt to track Pegasus toward the latter part of the day yesterday. The astronauts attempted to sight the Pegasus satellite on their third attempt as they went past the Ascension tracking site yesterday in the evening, that is, the evening of Central Standard Time, but had very little luck. We're standing by to monitor any additional conversation between the ground and the crew.
222:48:40 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston.
222:48:42 McDivitt: Go ahead, Houston.
222:48:43 Worden: Roger. When you lose the LM, we'd like you to do a Verb 83 and tell us what range you are at.
222:48:51 McDivitt: Okay. Right now, he's against the Earth background, and Dave can't see him. We've been marking, but we just can't see him right now. Auto Optics has been following him, but no more marks for the last 4 minutes or so.
222:49:05 Worden: Okay. Understand.
222:49:08 Scott: I can pick him up every once in a while, but not long enough to get out of Auto Optics and take a mark. We'll have to process the last one before we call a Verb 83 up, anyway.
222:49:18 Worden: Okay, Dave.
222:49:27 Worden: Okay. You've got about two minutes to LOS, if you can do it before then.
222:49:31 Scott: Okay. I'm picking him up every once in awhile. Maybe he'll get to a dark background in a little while there I can hold on to him.
222:49:37 Worden: Okay. If we lose you here, we'll pick you up in Tananarive.
222:49:42 Scott: Yes. Will pick up a Verb 83 as soon as we get through the last mark.
222:49:45 Worden: Okay, Dave,
TANANARIVE [REV 141 ]
Apollo 3 [?] has moved out of range of the tracking ship Redstone at the present time heading toward the west coast of South America on this the 140th revolution on the flight of Apollo 9. At 222 hours, 51 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
223:37:38 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston through Tananarive.
223:37:46 Scott: Roger, Houston. How do you read?
223:37:48 Worden: I read you loud and clear, and just want you to know we are standing by at Tananarive, and we expect to talk to you in Hawaii at 224:14.
223:38:04 Schweickart: Roger. 224:14. and if we're on there long enough, we'll give you our power down schedule.
223:38:17 Worden: Okay. Apollo 9, Houston here. We are reading you a little better. We can go ahead and take some of your power down stuff now, if you have it.
223:38:28 Schweickart: Okay. Ready to copy, Al?
223:38:30 Worden: Yes. All set, Rusty.
223:38:32 Schweickart: Okay. Service Module A, B, C, D: 51 54 40 48. Batt C Power, A, B: 369 370 370. Injectors: 5.0, 5.0, Off-Scale High, 5.0, 5.0, 4.9. Two ID'S 3125 6127 8027. Over.
223:39:04 Worden: Roger, Rusty. Copy. 51 54 40 48, 369 370 370, 50 50 Off Scale High 50 49, 3125 6227 8027.
223:39:32 Schweickart: Roger. You missed one - 5 .0 in the injector. 4.9 was six Delta.
223:39:40 Worden: Roger. We copied that.
223:39:42 Schweickart: Okay
223:39:49 Worden: And while we have you on the line, did you get a range for LOS on the LM?
223:40:00 Scott: Roger. I got the figures for you - times. I didn't get you a good range because we can't run Verb 83 along with P20. But those are the times for the first sightings to the last sightings and the beginning and the end of the marks. Okay?
223:40:17 Worden: Okay. We are running out of coverage at Tananarive. I guess we'd better save it for Hawaii. See you there at 14.
223:40:25 Scott: Oh, very well.
HAWAII [REV 141 ]
This is Apollo Control at 223 hours, 55 minutes. During the change of shift press conference, the spacecraft passed over the tracking site of Tananarive and we recorded about two and one-half to three minutes of conversation between the Apollo 9 crew and astronaut Al Worden, who is CapCom here on the ground. We will play that tape for you, so roll the tape, please.
With the spacecraft presently over China on this the 141st revolution, we expect to be back up at 14 after the hour or approximately 224 hours plus 14 when the spacecraft will be acquired by the tracking station at Hawaii. At 223 hours, 59 minutes GET this is Mission Control.
This is Apollo Control at 224 hours, 14 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We expect to acquire the Apollo 9 spacecraft at the Hawaii site in a matter of 10 or less seconds. And during that pass we will transmit a considerable amount of data to the crew, so we'll stand by for the air-to-ground. SC Houston.
224:16:16 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9.
224:16:18 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston here.
224:16:20 McDivitt: Roger. Hello there.
224:16:25 McDivitt: Houston, How do you read Apollo 9?
224:16:27 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston reads you loud and clear. How are you doing?
224:16:32 McDivitt: Pretty good. I've got a couple of questions for you.
224:16:34 Worden: Okay.
224:16:36 McDivitt: Did you want us to leave inverter 3 on MAIN A and [garble] transformer on tonight, like last night?
224:16:42 Worden: That is affirmative, Apollo 9.
224:16:44 McDivitt: Okay, we configured that right.
224:16:46 Worden: Okay. We've got a question for you: have you switched tanks on quad Charlie yet?
224:16:53 McDivitt: Negative.
224:16:54 Worden: Okay. We're reading a little low quantity; we just wondered.
224:16:58 McDivitt: No. unless they've been inadvertently opened sometime during the flight, they should still be closed, and we have not switched them.
224:17:06 Worden: Roger, Apollo 9. Houston copies, and you want to give me that LM LOS stuff now?
224:17:18 Scott: Okay. Let me give it to you real quick here. The first sighting we had was at 222:25:55. It wasn't good enough to mark on, but we did pick him up occasionally. The first mark was at 222:39:40. The last mark was at 222:45:40. Then we saw him every once in a while until 222:51:43, and that was the last time we had any sightings at all.
224:17:57 Worden: Roger, Apollo 9. understand you got your first sighting at 222:25:55. You didn't take a mark. You got your first mark at 222:39:40 and your last one at 222:45:40, and you had him in sight until 222:51:43.
224:18:17 Scott: Roger. The times we were not marking, we would only get a visual on him maybe two seconds out of every 30 or 40, so you couldn't really get him lined up to take a mark. But with state vectors you have and with the machinery up there, it really looked pretty good.
224:18:33 Worden: Roger Dave. Understand. Would you give us a Verb 66 and shift that state vector over now?
224:18:43 Scott: Okay. Give you a Verb 66 now.
224:18:47 McDivitt: And, Houston Apollo 9. we have some information for reentry storage.
224:18:52 Worden: Roger. Understand reentry storage go ahead.
224:18:55 McDivitt: Okay. We have the [garble] one of the large suits and center seat folded, and the L-shaped AGS underneath the center couch. We have a large pressure suit and all three helmets tied down on the floor between the L-shaped AGS and the lithium hydroxide canisters on the front part of the LEB floor. We're going to have two large bags of trash that will probably be tied down in the Lower Equipment Bay, and we'll give you more on that tomorrow. The rest of the spacecraft will be stowed essentially the same, the one exception being the food. B-1 - Locker B-1, Bravo One, that is in Lower Equipment Bay has just trash in it right now, and it will weigh somewhat less than it did at launch. Lockers L-3 will be full of food. They'll have somewhat less than the food that was in them at launch, but we'll stuff some trash in there and try to at least fill them up. As I mentioned earlier, all the LM data is over in A-1.
224:20:15 Worden: Roger. Apollo 9, Houston, copy. Would you give us a Verb 74 right now, Jim?
224:20:21 McDivitt: Roger. Verb 74.
224:20:23 Scott: 3, 2, 1
224:20:26 Scott: Mark
224:20:36 McDivitt: And Houston, that's about all the data I have for Retro. Essentially, the spacecraft is stowed pretty much the same way it was at launch, except for the LM data in A-1. The two pressure system or L-shaped bags - both of them on the floor, and other pressure suit lying crossways in the LEB, just forward of the lithium hydroxide canisters.
224:20:57 Worden: Roger. Apollo 9, Houston. Copy all that, and the Gold Team would like to say so long to you; It's been fun working.
224:21:06 Schweickart: Say, Gold Team, we've enjoyed every moment with you, and we'd sure like to thank you for all your help. We'll see you at the big debriefing that Mr Kranz is going to arrange.
224:21:16 Worden: Roger. I think everybody's agreeable to that.
224:21:19 Schweickart: Okay. You've got a fine bunch of guys, let me tell you.
ASCENSION [REV 142 ]
We believe that the spacecraft has gone beyond range of the tracking station at Hawaii. The astronauts of course will be doing some light housekeeping work now in preparation to settling down in their couches for the rest cycle. At 224 hours, 22 minutes GET; this is Apollo Control.
224:58:14 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston through Ascension.
224:58:45 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston.
224:59:08 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston through Ascension.
224:59:34 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston.
225:00:07 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston through Ascension.
225:00:35 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston.
225:01:03 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston.
225:01:27 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston through Ascension.
225:01:48 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston.
225:02:13 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 225 hours, 5 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We just passed out of range of the Ascension Island tracking station, and during the 3 or 4 minutes that we were within range at Ascension, the CapCom here in Houston, that would be Al Worden, tried to call the Apollo 9 crew. He placed a half dozen or so calls up to the crew, but there was no response. About this time the crew is in its - probably in its eat, eating cycle, and the belief here of course is that they have their head sets off and were either eating their meal or perhaps eating and stowing some of their food - eating their meal and stowing their food. At any rate, we did not have any air-to-ground with them although we did query them on a half a dozen or so occasions. The spacecraft systems look like they're okay according to the downlinked information. So at 225 hours, 6 minutes GET; this is Mission Control.
This is Apollo Control at 226 hours, 9 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. At the present time, the spacecraft is over the Pacific Ocean, approaching the west coast of South America. It will take another 20 or so minutes before we are in range of a tracking station. In that case, it would be the station at Ascension. The spacecraft on this, the 142 revolution, is flying at an apogee, or reaches an apogee of 244.3 nautical miles [452.4 km], and its low point is 98.1 nautical miles [181.7 km]. It makes one rev around Earth every 90 minutes, about 91 minutes. A little earlier, the Flight Dynamics Officer passed the following information on to the people at Mission Control here. He estimates now, that the descent stage will reenter the Earth's atmosphere on March 16, around 8:00 pm Central Standard Time. At 226 hours, 11 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
