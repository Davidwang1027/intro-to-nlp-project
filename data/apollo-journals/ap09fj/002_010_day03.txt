GUAM (REV 25)
039:20:24 Evans: Good morning, Apollo 9. Houston calling. [Long pause]
039:20:45 McDivitt: Good morning, Houston. Apollo 9.
039:20:48 Evans: Roger. I'm a long ways away, so you can't hit me for wake you up.
039:20:53 McDivitt: Say again.
039:20:54 Evans: I'm a long ways away, so you can't swing and bit me on waking up.
039:20:59 McDivitt: Okay. How's everything looking down there?
039:21:07 Evans: It's looked beautiful all night; kept it so quiet here that we didn't have too much to do.
039:21:13 McDivitt: Oh. Very good. [Pause]
039:21:20 Evans: I have a lot of good information here: Flight Plan update, consumables, and some block data when you get around to copying some of it.
039:21:30 McDivitt: Okay. Stand by one.
Comm break.
039:22:49 McDivitt: Okay, Houston. Go with your Flight Plan update.
039:22:57 Evans: Roger. At time about 39 plus 55, primary glycol accumulator refill. Fill to 50 to 55 percent, LMP 2 dash 7 step 4. Over. [Long pause]

039:XX:XX Evans: Roger, Chief, this is the stuff that I wanted to [garble] Rusty, do you have your headset on?
039:XX:XX Unidentifiable crewmember: [Garble].
039:XX:XX Evans: Okay [garble] He was concerned about the (garble) call out for (garble) rev number is 140 - 1 4 0 [garble].
039:XX:XX Unidentifiable crewmember: [Garble].
039:XX:XX Evans: Roger.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control again. We're still over the tracking ship Mercury with something like 7 minutes left in this pass over the ship, but there's no conversation going on at the present time from the spacecraft communicator's console. Apparently the crew is still getting waked up and ready to start their breakfast meal. We'll continue to monitor the air-ground in case some further conversation does arise. We're standing by on air-to-ground.
This is Apollo Control still over Mercury with some four minutes left. Apparently there will be no further conversations with the crew at this time until they come over Ascension. Scheduled originally over Ascension was the block data but that has already been read up to the crew by spacecraft communicator Ron Evans. Wake-up took place at 39 hours 21 minutes ground elapsed time; command module pilot Dave Scott responded to the first call and also jotted down all of the Flight Plan updates and the block data. At 39 hours 38 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
039:39:23 Berry: ... [garble] rest of that mission and have the trouble postflight. Let me ask you two other quick things while we've got you on here and [garble]. Have you had any symptoms at all up there, Jim , any of you?
039:39:31 McDivitt: Symptoms of what?
039:39:32 Berry: Any - anything of the cold. You sound pretty nasal up there, and have you had anything that looks like any recurrence of your cold symptoms?
039:39:43 McDivitt: I don't believe so. My - my nose is stuffed. I'm going to slip some nose drops in this morning, but I expected that, and - Just let me check this.
039:40:57 McDivitt: No, Rusty doesn't have any symptoms of a cold.
039:41:01 Scott: And I don't have it at all, Chuck, at this date.
039:41:06 Berry: Good. Okay, Jim, it's no worse as far as you're concerned than it was in Gemini. Is that right?
039:41:09 McDivitt: Negative.
039:41:12 Scott: As a matter of fact, Jim opened up the nose drops yesterday, and we had enough fumes in here to clear everybody up within 10 minutes.
039:41:18 Berry: Very good. Listen, could we get a quick report on what you did for sleep yesterday and today? We didn't get that yesterday morning and we'll wipe it out right now, if you got a minute.
039:41:29 McDivitt: Okay, this is Jim. I got up - On the first night, I slept in about 10-minute stretches, very restless; and I don't know how much I got cumulative, maybe a couple of hours. Last night, I slept pretty good in about - Except I had one big 4-hour period, and I had another one of about 2 or 3 hours. I slept pretty well last night.
039:41:50 Berry: That's good. Your heart rate looks that way, Jim.
039:41:53 Scott: Okay, this is Dave. I slept the first night about four 1-1/2-hour cracks; and, last night, I guess I got about, oh, 7 hours total and about, maybe a couple of 3-hour stretches and another hour or hour-and-a-half stretch.
039:42:09 Berry: And all good?
039:42:11 Scott: Yes, it's all pretty good,
039:42:13 Berry: Good show. How about Rusty?
039:42:17 Scott: Rusty feels like he got a good 7 hours last night. As a matter of fact, he wanted to - he wondered when he woke up how long it had been since he went to sleep.
039:42:26 Berry: Good. How about the first night, Dave?
039:42:32 Scott: He says he thinks he got about 7 also, and he said he only woke up one time last night.
039:42:38 Berry: Okay, I think that - that clears us from here. We've still got some - some time there. Did any of you get any motion sickness in the - yesterday? [Pause]
039:42:54 McDivitt: This is Jim. Negative, I don't have any. Just a second.
039:42:57 Scott: Dave, negative.
039:43:05 Scott: Rusty says he took a Marezine this morning just to stay ahead of it. And he also, I guess, wanted you to know that he took a Seconal each night.
039:43:12 Berry: He did take a Seconal last [garble] or the [garble].
039:43:18 Scott: Both nights.
Very long comm break.
039:50:25 Scott (onboard): Yes, sir.
039:50:37 Scott (onboard): Tool - no, tool E up there is the one you need. They're both up by your shoulder.
039:51:22 Scott (onboard): Yes, I'm sure they'll want to watch it, and we got about 4 minutes before the time that he called.
039:52:08 Scott (onboard): Hey, this food even smells good this morning. I don't know whether I can smell it or not. It's all wrapped up. How can I smell it?
039:52:20 Scott (onboard): Oh, gee, that's nice.
039:53:43 Scott (onboard): Hey, can somebody reach the hot-water spigot down there?
039:54:02 Scott (onboard): Thank you. This is good old hot. I'm going to have me some hot chocky.
039:54:23 Scott (onboard): Well, Jim, we're not over a station. I guess they don't really care, so anytime you're ready, you can grab your tool E and proceed to the glycol accumulator fill; and I shall read you the checklist - a very long, difficult process.
039:54:50 Scott (onboard): You're not broadcasting to me. You're on PTT. That's alright. I can see your motion. Excellent! Ooh, that's nice.
039:55:20 Scott (onboard): Okay, step number 1: PRIMARY ACCUMULATOR FILL valve - ON! Let me see, we want to go to 50 to 55 percent; and right now we're about 35, so just turn it ON and I'll give you a call at 50, and we'll see how it stabilizes out. Okay?
039:55:41 Scott (onboard): Add more. Okay, turn if OFF. I figured that. Okay, turn it - you can turn it back ON. It just takes it awhile - It'll overshoot.
039:55:58 Scott (onboard): Okay, OFF.
039:56:01 Scott (onboard): Okay, back ON.
039:56:07 Scott (onboard): Okay, OFF.
039:56:11 Scott (onboard): Be ON just a tweek.
039:56:16 Scott (onboard): Okay, OFF. Beautiful. Well done. Now turn OFF, and that's all. Gee, you did a good job, Jim.
039:56:30 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, are you reading me now?
039:56:32 Scott (onboard): Yes.
039:57:01 Scott (onboard): Oh, yes [garble].
039:57:11 Scott (onboard): Okay, let's see, and the first thing we're going to have to do, is in 1 hour and 3 minutes is the P51, so that gives you an idea what we are in time.
039:57:19 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, fine.
039:57:28 Scott (onboard): Here you are. I'm going to go ahead and fill my other bags up right away.
039:57:37 McDivitt (onboard): Well - Why don't you keep - why don't you keep going? Why don't you keep - You want me to open this stuff for you?
039:58:38 Scott (onboard): Whew!
039:58:45 McDivitt (onboard): Too many things to hold on to here.
039:59:05 McDivitt (onboard): Okay? Why don't we get another one then?
039:59:22 McDivitt (onboard): What is that anyway? I never even heard of it. You cracked one?
039:59:34 Scott (onboard): Let's hope we get this squared away so we can get our update.
040:00:19 McDivitt (onboard): Think I'll take a couple of aspirins; just a touch of a sign of a headache - runny nose.
040:00:41 McDivitt (onboard): Get that? [Garble].
040:00:43 Scott (onboard): Huh?
040:00:56 McDivitt (onboard): Do you need anything down here, Dave?
040:00:59 Scott (onboard): No, not yet. I will in just a second, though.
040:01:02 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, I'm just waiting.
040:01:14 McDivitt (onboard): Get the other bag, too, Rusty - put the rest of the stuff in it.
040:01:37 Scott (onboard): Okay, got a RESTART this morning when we started the computer.
040:01:42 McDivitt (onboard): How about that?
040:02:31 Schweickart (onboard): Jim.
040:02:32 McDivitt (onboard): Yes?
040:02:33 Schweickart (onboard): I think [garble].
040:02:40 McDivitt (onboard): Oh, good.
040:02:45 Scott (onboard): Alright. I'll hand you the empty bag as soon as I drink my hot chocky.
This is Apollo Control 40 hours 10 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 9 is coming up on the tracking station at Ascension Island in the South Atlantic; this will be a pass lasting some 7 minutes 36 seconds. We'll stand by until spacecraft communicator Ron Evans puts in a call through Ascension to the crew of Apollo 9. We'll monitor the air-ground loop at this time.
ASCENSION (REV 26)
040:12:19 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Ascension. [Long pause]

040:13:26 Schweickart: Go ahead.
040:13:28 Evans: Roger. If you haven't already done it, we'll set up our hydrogen tank 1 and 2 heaters to AUTO and the fans OFF for the day. [Long pause]
040:13:42 Schweickart: Okay. Heaters 1 and 2 to AUTO and the funs OFF.
040:13:45 Evans: Roger. And I have your block data if you're ready to copy.
040:13:50 Scott: Okay. Stand by one, please.
040:13:52 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
040:13:56 Scott: Houston, how long's this pass?
040:13:59 Evans: They got a keyhole; we only have about a minute and a half here yet.
040:14:04 Scott: Okay, Stand by. [Long pause]
040:14:23 Scott: Okay. Go ahead, Houston. How about starting with 28 dash 2A?
040:14:28 Evans: Roger. 028 dash 2A Alfa, plus 249, minus 0264 043 02 57 3001; 029 Alfa Charlie, plus 317, minus 0285 044 46 10 3569; 030 2 Charlie, plus 340, minus 0290 046 24 14 3859. And, 9, Houston. You still with me? Apollo 9, Houston. [Long pause]
This is Apollo Control again, apparently we've had loss of signal at the Ascension Island tracking station. During the pass earlier this morning over the tracking ship Mercury, MSC director of medical operations Dr. Charles Berry did discuss with the crew their present physical condition. He ascertained their medical status for the next several days for a very busy Flight Plan. They reported no additional symptoms of colds although there was some nasal stuffiness reported due to the oxygen environment and he recommended they take afrin spray for that. They also gave him a sleep report for the first night; command module pilot Dave Scott reported 6 hours the first night, four hours on the second night and another block of an hour and a half's sleep for a total of some 5-1/2 hours. Commander Jim McDivitt had only two hours sleep the first night but a total of 7 hours sleep on the second night. Lunar module pilot Rusty Schweickart had a good solid 7 hours sleep on both nights. There had been no - there has been no evidence of motion sickness of any kind on ...
040:16:13 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, 40 hours 51 minutes GET. We're some 30 seconds away from acquisition at the tracking station Guam, which in turn overlaps with the coverage by the tracking ship Huntsville and on down through the Mercury. All of the three stations overlap each other for a total pass of around 28 minutes. During the series of three tracking station passes, the Mission Control Center here is scheduled to pass up to the crew a state vector update. The lunar module alinement optical telescope star observation pad and also the lunar module S-band steerable antenna pad. This information will be used during the later checkouts of the lunar module after it is manned. We're now some hour and 17 minutes away from opening the hatches between the command module and the lunar module. We should have had acquisition now, we'll stand by for spacecraft communicator Ron Evans to call the crew through Guam. Listening for the familiar beep sound as the spacecraft communicator keys his mike. There he goes.
GUAM (REV 27)
040:52:39 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Guam.
040:52:43 McDivitt: Roger. Houston, Apollo 9. Go.
040:52:45 Evans: Roger. We see you have P00. Request ACCEPT.
040:52:49 McDivitt: Roger. You got ACCEPT.
040:52:53 Evans: Roger. We'll send your state vector and your REFSMMAT up to you.
040:52:58 McDivitt: Okay.
040:53:01 Evans: We might continue with block data when you get a chance there.
040:53:04 McDivitt: Okay. Stand by one, please.
Comm break.
040:54:55 Schweickart: Houston, Apollo 9.
040:54:57 Evans: Houston. Go.
040:54:59 Schweickart: Okay. I copied up through the DELTA-VC on 030 dash 2 Charlie. Do you want to go from there?

040:57:52 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Your readback correct. [Pause]
040:58:04 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. The computer is yours.
040:58:08 Schweickart: Okay. I understand. And did you copy all that?
040:58:11 Evans: Affirmative. Your readback was correct, and I have a NAV check for you.
040:58:17 Schweickart: NAV check. Okay. Go ahead.
040:58:20 Evans: Roger. 04200 00000, plus 2858, plus 00646 1126. And this is 30 minutes prior to NAV update. [Pause]

041:20:00 Evans: Roger. Correct. And Canaries at 52.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. Apparently we have had LOS at Mercury, at least the acquisition table shows it. It's time to lose the signal at Mercury. Most of the information passed up to the crew of Apollo 9 during these three station passes here had to do with exercises to be done during the manning of the LM this morning. Among these were some numbers for using the optical alinement telescope onboard the LM and would involve using the star Sirius in the constellation Canis Majoris or Greater Dog in the southern celestial sphere. This star has been known to mariners for centuries as the Dog Star. Next station for acquisition will be the Ascension Island station. As you were, scrub that. Canary Islands, we miss Ascension on this particular rev, we're coming up on the end of rev 26 and will begin rev 27 and we'll acquire at Canary Islands at 51 minutes 50 seconds past the hour. At 41 hours 22 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo control. 41 hours 51 minutes ground elapse time. Some 15 seconds away from acquisition by the Canary Island tracking station. This pass will have a duration of some 6 minutes 16 seconds. One of the items to be passed up to the crew during this pass by spacecraft communicator Ron Evans will be a go for intravehicular transfer by Rusty Schweickart and Jim McDivitt into the LM. They don't go through at the same time, let's listen in on the conversation.
CANARY (REV 27)
041:52:08 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Canaries.
041:52:11 McDivitt: Roger. Houston, Apollo 9. Go.
041:52:16 Evans: I read you loud and clear. Everything looks good down here. You bare a G0 for IVT.
041:52:22 McDivitt: Roger. I understand c GO for IVT. Thank you. We're mushing along.

041:58:16 Evans: Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo control. We should have had loss of signal at this time with the Canary Islands station. At the present time the Flight Plan calls for the crew of Apollo 9 to be clearing the tunnel hardware from the tunnel connecting the lunar module and the command module. The hatches have to be removed, the probe and drogue assembly and then lunar module pilot Rusty Schweickart will travel through the tunnel into the LM and begin the status check. And also preparations for powering up the LM's systems. He's due to transfer into the LM at 42:10 ground elapse time and will be followed at about 43:10 by commander Jim McDivitt. Some 10 minutes away from hatch opening according to the count down clock which is set up to count down to various events during the mission. Here in mission control center Ron Evans is handing over the job of spacecraft communicator to Stu Roosa for the next 12 hours. The spacecraft analysis staff support room in the side hall of mission control here at ground elapse time of 40 hours, some 2 hours ago. They show a spacecraft status report. The report states that the environmental construscent, er, environmental control system and all the associated crew equipment have no change in the earlier status. In the propulsion and power systems the service propulsion system has no change. All measurements are within limits. The same holds true for the reaction control system. In the battery situation, battery A is continuing to charge with approximately nine and a half amp-hours put back into battery A. Of a total charge required at 12.2 amp hours. Battery B has 6.8 amp hours drained out and remaining amp hours are 33.2. Battery C amp hours out 1.13 with 38.87 amp hours remaining. The cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen aboard the spacecraft - all of the quantities at least in the oxygen are slightly above prelaunch predictions, while the hydrogen quantities are remaining slightly below the predictions. The hydrogen pressures continue to come, back up while the oxygen is cycling normally. Some percentages and quantities in pounds are as follows: Oxygen - cryogenic oxygen tank 1 has 81.07 percent for 262 pounds; cryogenic oxygen tank 2 has 82.16 percent for a quantity of 266 pounds; hydrogen tank 1 79.64 percent for 22.4 pounds; hydrogen tank 2 77.85 percent for 21.9 pounds. The totals in oxygen are 528 pounds; hydrogen 44.3 pounds. The service module fuel cells are performing normally according to this report. All command and service module temperatures are within limits in the structures and thermal area of the report. The next station to acquire Apollo 9 will be Honeysuckle. However, just prior to Honeysuckle acquisition at 37 minutes past the hour, there will be an attempt to relay through an ARIA aircraft, that is, Apollo Range instrumented aircraft, at 29 past the hour. Which will be somewhat to the north of the Honeysuckle, Australia station. At 42 hours 04 minutes GET, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 42 hours 29 minutes GET. We should be acquiring with the ARIA aircraft somewhere just west of the Island of New Guinea. We'll stand by. We hear a side tone of the relay from the aircraft. However, the spacecraft communicator, Stu Roosa here in Mission Control, has not put through a call yet. The ARIA's relay will overlap the Honeysuckle station between Honeysuckle LOS and Mercury. Actually, we'll have some tracking there by the ship Huntsville. And then on to the Mercury with a few seconds dropout between Huntsville and Mercury. The orbital tracks are beginning to be to the southwest of the ships and this will likely be the last pass in which these two ships in the South Pacific will be able to acquire Apollo 9 until some 24 hours later when the orbital track comes back over them. We're still standing by here for any possible contact through the relay aircraft. Apollo Range Instrumented Aircraft with an acronym, ARIA. At this time, Lunar Module Pilot Rusty Schweickart should be inside the LM and for the first time in this mission, the code names for the two spacecraft, Gumdrop and Spider, will come into use as we have three-way communications. Scott and McDivitt still inside the command module and Schweickart in the lunar module. He's calling now.
ARIA (REV 27)
042:3X:XX Roosa: Houston CAPCOM. Go remote.
042:3X:XX Roosa: ARIA Houston, this is ARIA I'm going remote at this time.
042:31:49 Roosa: Roger. Apollo 9, this is Houston through ARIA 1. How do you read?
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. Apparently there is some difficulty in establishing contact through the ARIA aircraft. We'll continue to monitor the air-ground circuit.
This is Apollo Control. Still nothing but noise on the air-ground circuit. We're still approximately 1 minute away from acquisition at Honeysuckle. We'll continue to stay on the air-ground circuit in case there is contact through the ARIA aircraft.
HONEYSUCKLE (27)
042:38:31 Roosa: Apollo 9, this is Houston through Honeysuckle. [Pause]
042:38:45 McDivitt: Roger. Houston, this is Apollo 9 here. Go ahead.
042:38:50 Roosa: Roger. Copy. We're just standing by.
042:38:53 McDivitt: Okay. We're still trying to do a P51 here. We haven't started clearing the tunnel, so we're running quite a bit late.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We're still standing by here over Honeysuckle. There'll be a brief drop out between Honeysuckle loss of signal and tracking ship Mercury acquisition signal. Apparently the crew is quite busy at this time doing a platform alinement. They advised spacecraft communicator Stu Roosa here in Mission Control that they had not cleared the tunnel as yet to begin the intravehicular transfer from the command module to the lunar module. We'll continue monitoring this pass but it is unlikely there will be too much conversation.
042:44:19 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, Houston. We'll see you over Mercury in about 3 minutes.
042:44:25 McDivitt: Roger.
Long comm break.
MERCURY (REV 27)
042:48:03 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. We've got you through Mercury.
042:48:05 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9. Say again.
042:48:06 Roosa: Roger. We've got you through the Mercury solid; have you for about another 8-1/2 minutes.
042:48:12 Scott: Roger. We've just completed a P51 and 52, and we'll be mushing on.
042:48:16 Roosa: Roger.
Long comm break.
042:53:15 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
042:53:18 Roosa: Go, Apollo 9.
042:53:21 Scott: Roger. We're going to be pretty busy here for the next few minutes. If you see us getting toward gimbal lock, let us know.
042:53:28 Roosa: Roger. We'll only have contact with you for the next 3 minutes, and then our next station is Antigua at 17. [Pause]
042:53:37 Scott: Okay.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We're still in acquisition by the tracking ship Mercury, however it appears there will not be to much additional conversation during this pass. Earlier in the pass over Honeysuckle, spacecraft commander Jim McDivitt reported that the tunnel between the two spacecrafts has not been cleared yet of the probe and the drogue and the hatches. They were still in platform alinement task. We'll continue to monitor the Mercury pass untill loss of signal but it will likely be dead air.
This is Apollo Control. According to the tables in front of the control room, we should have had loss of signal at the tracking ship Mercury. The next station will be Antigua at 17 past the hour. At 42 hours 57 minutes GET this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 43 hours 16 minutes GET. We are a few seconds away from acquisition at the Antigua tracking station. At the beginning of revolution number 28. Apollo 9 presently is in an orbit with a perigee of 109.1 nautical miles and an apogee of 271.7 nautical miles. Total weight of both spacecraft is now at 62,545 pounds. Here in Mission Control, there is several huddles going around and discussion of how best to get back on the mission time-line. The delay is caused by the crew not having been able to aline the platform prior to the intravehicular transfer into the lunar module. We'll stand by now for acquisition at Antigua overlapping tracking ship Vanguard on through the Canary Islands and Madrid for a total time of some 20 minutes. Standing by for the familiar beep beep sound as CAPCOM keys his headset.
ANTIGUA (REV 28)
043:18:36 Roosa: Apollo 9, this is Houston through Antigua. Standing by.
043:18:39 McDivitt: Okay, Houston. We have the tunnel clear now, and we're starting the transfer.
043:18:44 Roosa: Roger. Copy.
Comm break.
043:20:12 McDivitt: Houston, the docking tunnel index angle is plus 2.1.
043:20:18 Roosa: Roger. Copy plus 2.1. Thank you.
Comm break.
043:21:37 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9.
043:21:39 Roosa: Go, Apollo 9.
043:21:41 McDivitt: Since we're running so far late here, you might take a look at the Flight Plan and see what needs to be changed, I haven't had time to do that.
043:21:51 Roosa: Roger. We're working on that now. We can give you some recommendations later on.
043:21:57 McDivitt: Roger. [Long pause]
043:22:28 McDivitt: Houston, just for your info, tunnel clearing went pretty much according to plan.
043:22:34 Roosa: Roger. I understand that tunnel clearing went real well and just for info, we're looking ahead. We're just saying press right on down the line right now, Jim, and we may just slip the docked DPS the REV.
043:22:51 Roosa: But I think with your activity in there, you may just make up a good bit of this time. [Long pause]
043:23:51 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9.
043:23:53 Roosa: Go, Apollo 9.
043:23:54 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. Go ahead. [Pause]
043:24:05 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9.
043:24:09 Roosa: Go ahead, Apollo 9. Houston is reading you loud and clear.
043:24:13 McDivitt: Roger. Another little piece of info for you. The drogue looks as good as new. There was a very small pencil line about 4 inches long, and that's about all we could see on it.
043:24:28 Roosa: Roger, Apollo 9. Copy.

CANARY (REV 28)
043:28:28 Scott: This is Apollo, Houston. Apollo 9.
043:28:29 Roosa: Go, Apollo 9.
043:28:32 Scott: One little problem we might advise you of here, you might think about it. On the optics on the drive - The manual drive of the optics, the shaft seems to hang up around 64 degrees when you try to drive it manually. Seems to drive okay automatically. The feedback, the readout on the LEB, the mechanical readout is frozen at 64 degrees. The numbers read 64.0, and we haven't been able to get that to move since yesterday. Once you get past the 64-degreemark, it seems to work okay.
043:29:13 Roosa: Roger, Apollo 9 Houston copies.
043:29:20 Scott: Okay.
Comm break.
043:31:59 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, Houston. We'd like to have you bring up your S-band volume; we'll be working Madrid.
043:32:04 Scott: Roger. S-Band up.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control here. We're in a gap now between Vanguard loss of signal and Canary acquisition just a few seconds drop out here. We'll continue to monitor the air-ground circuit for any possible conversation.
MADRID (REV 28)
043:34:50 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
043:34:51 Roosa: Go, Apollo 9.
043:34:55 Scott: Okay. I've got the gyro torquing angles for the P52 if you're ready to copy.
043:35:00 Roosa: Go ahead.

043:35:24 Scott: Okay.
Comm break.
043:37:21 Roosa: Okay. Apollo 9, Houston. We're going to lose you at Madrid in about a minute, and we'll see you over Carnarvon at 04.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. Apparently we have had loss of signal at Canary Islands. During that combined pass over Antigua, Vanguard, Canary and Madrid there was some discussion there of getting back on the time line. Stu Roosa, spacecraft communicator, indicated that perhaps they may slip the dock descent propulsion system burn by one revolution. Jim McDivitt, Apollo 9 commander, reported that they had some minor problem with the command module sextant and telescope optics in the manual mode where it sticks at 64 1/4. The space flight meteorology group here at mission control has issued an advisory for weather conditions for the flight, of Apollo 9, and landing zones for today and tomorrow. The primary landing zone in the West Atlantic centered about 800 miles east of Jacksonville, skies will be partly cloudy, winds will be northerly 20 to 25 knots with seas 6 to 8 feet and temperatures near 68 1/4. In the Mid-Pacific landing zone centered at about 600 miles northwest of Honolulu, weather will be partly cloudy with southerly winds 15 to 20 knots. Seas are expected to be 7 feet with temperatures ranging from 60 degrees to 70 degrees. In the west Pacific landing zone centered about 400 miles southeast of Tokyo, skies will be partly cloudy, winds will be northeasterly with seas 5 feet and temperatures 50 degrees to 55 degrees. In the east Atlantic landing zone centered about 500 miles southwest of the Canary Islands, partly cloudy skies are forecast with easterly winds 10 to 15 knots, seas up to 3 feet, and temperatures 60 degrees to 70 degrees. Next station to be acquired by Apollo 9 will be the Canarvon, Australia tracking station. At 3 minutes past the hour, lapping over Honeysuckle and on in to Mercury for a total pass time of the three stations of some 30 minutes. At 43 hours 40 minutes GET this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo control. At 43 hours, 51 minutes ground elapse time, Apollo 9 is currently over the Persian Gulf. And we've had confirmation that lunar module pilot Rusty Schweickart has indeed transfered to the lunar module. We're beginning to get data now on displays from the various lunar module systems and Jean Kranz the white team flight team flight director who is in for the first manning of the LM although he does not go on duty for a couple of hours ah did ah say that apparently at Canary sometime during the Canary pass Schweickart did transfer to the lunar module. There likely will be a three way conversation during the coming pass over Carnarvon, Honeysuckle, and Mercury with the call signs Gumdrop and Spider. Gumdrop representing the command module with McDivitt and Scott still aboard and Spider meaning the lunar module with Rusty Schweickart minding the store and powering up the spacecraft getting ready for the day's activities and activating the LM and the later docked descent propulsion system burn. At 43 hours 52 minutes ground elapse time this is Apollo control.
044:00:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Gumdrop, Spider. How do you read?
044:00:49 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
044:00:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You're terrible. I got all kinds of noise here and I can't seem to squelch it out.
044:01:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I got the squelches all the way up.
044:01:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Same. Let me try my other PTT here. Okay, how do you read that?
044:01:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, fine. I'm going to try the VOX now.
044:01:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger. 1, 2, 3, [garble]; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
044:01:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. How about-now?
044:01:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
044:01:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Now, I'm going to switch antennas here.
044:01:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. I still got all kinds of noise; how do you read me?
044:02:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] you switching antennas.
044:02:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's a little bit louder, but I still got all the noise. Stand by.
044:02:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Wait a minute. That's probably S-band noise. Let me turn down my S-band.
044:02:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Guess what. That was all S-band noise.
044:02:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. I'm going back on the other antenna. How's that now?
044:02:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] 5 square. Let's just stay here.
044:02:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, I do have the tape on.
044:02:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Stand by. VHF B SQUELCH coming down.
044:02:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): There it is. I've got it set on about 4-1/2.
044:03:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. You ready to go over to A?
044:03:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Let's go Simplex A.
044:03:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. How do you read on Simplex A?
044:03:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] square.
This is Apollo Control, 44 hours 03 minutes ground elapsed time. Approaching acquisition at Carnarvon, Australia which will overlap with the Honeysuckle station and on into the Mercury for about 30 minutes total time. We've had one initial call, we'll eavesdrop now.
CARNARVON (REV 28)
044:03:25 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay, how do you read on SIMPLEX A?
044:03:27 Scott (GUMDROP): Five square.
044:03:33 Schweickart (SPIDER): VEF B transmitter has come - I mean VHF B transmitter is sensational.
044:03:40 Scott (GUMDROP): Your - Spider, this Gumdrop. Do you read? [Pause]
044:03:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We want the tape off now also, right?
044:03:54 Schweickart (SPIDER): Gumdrop, Spider.
044:03:57 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Go ahead, Spider. Gumdrop here.
044:03:59 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Do you want the tape off now, also?
044:04:00 Scott (GUMDROP): It doesn't say so. Seems like a good idea, though.
044:04:06 Schweickart (SPIDER): Yes. Tape coming off.
044:04:10 Roosa: And, Spider, Gumdrop...
044:04:12 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Okay. We're configuring the CSM for the ...
044:04:15 Schweickart (SPIDER): Go ahead, Jim.
044:04:17 McDivitt (GUMDROP): ... LM data, and we want you to go to TELEMETRY LOW.
044:04:20 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. We're TELEMETRY LOW.
044:04:22 McDivitt (GUMDROP): VHG B transmitter to DATA and VHF B receiver OFF.
044:04:25 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Got it.
044:04:28 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. We've already done the antenna checks.
044:04:31 Schweickart (SPIDER): Just a second.
044:04:35 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. Could you give us high bit rate, please?
044:04:40 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger, Houston, Spider. High bit rate. How do you read, Houston?
044:04:44 Roosa: I read you five-square. And, Gumdrop, I'm copying you five-by-five.
044:04:48 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger.
044:04:52 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Okay. I've got the tape off here now. Was there any noticeable difference between the antennas?
044:04:56 Schweickart (SPIDER): Oh, a little bit, but I had a lot of noise in the S-band when I tried it.
044:05:00 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Okay. Let's just stay where we are; this is good over here.
044:05:03 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Good here, too.
044:05:06 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Okay. I'm going to be coming over now, so I'll see you in a minute.
044:05:09 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. Now wait a minute. I've got to get my hose hooked up here, Jim.
044:05:13 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Roger.
044:05:17 Schweickart (SPIDER): Gumdrop?
044:05:18 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Go ahead.
044:05:19 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. We're going to have to transfer me onto the ECS first. First few steps there are mine, I think.
044:05:25 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Okay. Let me go back here and get these. [Pause]
044:05:40 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Yes. When you get ready to transfer over, let us know; we'll turn your suit flow off.
044:05:46 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay, standby. Let me advise.
044:05:48 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Okay.
044:05:52 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston.
044:05:54 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Go ahead.
044:05:56 Roosa: Roger. We're trying to do a little planning here. We'd like to have your opinion on how you're doing on the timeline. And we're looking, trying to size up whether or not you're more than an hour behind it.
044:06:10 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Just a minute, and let me see. We're just about ready to start the CDR transfer, which is supposed to take place at 43:08, and we're at 44:06.
044:06:21 Schweickart (SPIDER): [Garble] to my suit, there, [garble] Gumdrop.
044:06:24 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Okay. Just a minute. We'll get if off. So we're running just about an hour behind.
044:06:31 Roosa: Okay. Copied.
044:06:34 McDivitt (GUMDROP): We haven't run into any glitches yet, so we're going right along here. Maybe we can pick up some time here in a minute.
044:06:41 Roosa: Roger. Copy.
044:06:45 McDivitt (GUMDROP): It's okay, Rusty; suit flow coming off now.
044:06:47 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. [Long pause]
044:06:58 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. Then the LMP's supposed to take his suit isolation valve and let his suit flow when you get plugged in? [Pause]
044:07:16 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay [garble] I'm in suit flow.
044:07:19 McDivitt (GUMDROP): You're in suit flow. Okay we'll [garble] the umbilical here.
044:07:25 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Okay, we're going to pass the ISO over to you in just a minute, soon as we get the ...
044:07:31 Schweickart (SPIDER): All right.
044:07:32 Roosa: Spider, Houston. We'd like to have DFI ON when able.
044:07:39 McDivitt (GUMDROP): And did you get that, Rusty? They want the DFI ON. And, Spider, configure the cabin with the straps, utility lights, [garble], and restraints.
044:07:52 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay, Houston. We got the DFI ON, and be advised we had a MASTER ALARM with DFI ON, and I don't have any other lights on.
044:08:01 Roosa: Roger. Copy. [Pause]
044:08:06 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Okay. And I'm going to disconnect here. I'll be on my way over in a minute, Rusty.
044:08:13 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. Stand by. Okay. I'm ready.
044:08:15 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Okay. I'll put the checklist away, and I'll take my helmet off and be over in a minute.
Comm break.
044:10:45 Roosa: Spider, Houston. When you get a chance, we'd like to have the DFI OFF; we're heating up the glycol a little bit.
044:10:55 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. I'll be with you in just a second.
044:10:58 Roosa: Roger. And, Gumdrop and Spider, like to ensure S-band volume, up. We're going over to Honeysuckle shortly.
044:11:08 McDivitt (GUMDROP): [Garble]. Gumdrop.
044:11:18 Schweickart (SPIDER): And, Houston, this is Spider.
044:11:19 Roosa: Go.

044:15:55 Roosa: And, Spider, Houston. We'd like to have R and D instrumentation circuit breaker Baker IN as soon as you can. [Pause]
044:16:08 Scott (GUMDROP): Spider, Gumdrop. R and D instrumentation circuit breaker Baker IN when you have a chance. [Pause]
044:16:22 Scott (GUMDROP): You say it is IN?
044:16:24 Roosa: Okay. Thank you, Gumdrop.
044:16:29 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, you're 40 degrees yaw. We're watching it.
044:16:32 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. Thank you.
Long comm break.
044:19:37 Schweickart (SPIDER): Houston, this is Spider. If you read, be advised, that we got good signal strength on S-band, but we're getting some static and a steady tone.
044:19:47 Roosa: Roger, Spider. And we're reading you loud and clear now. Honeysuckle had you on a side lobe. We've got you in good voice, and we're getting data. [Long pause]
044:20:13 McDivitt (SPIDER): Hello, Gumdrop. This is Spider. How do you read?
044:20:16 Scott (GUMDROP): Five-square. How me?
044:20:17 McDivitt (SPIDER): Loud and clear. Let me check a couple of the other buttons here.
044:20:19 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay.
044:20:21 McDivitt (SPIDER): How do you read me on this one?
044:20:22 Scott (GUMDROP): Five-square.
044:20:23 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Let me try [garble] check the VOX. [Long pause]
044:20:43 McDivitt (SPIDER): Hello, Gumdrop. This is Spider. How do you read?
044:20:47 Scott (GUMDROP): Sounds good.
044:20:48 McDivitt (SPIDER): Do you read me now, all right?
044:20:49 Scott (GUMDROP): Five-square.
044:20:52 McDivitt (SPIDER): That's good.
044:20:53 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, Houston. Copied all three of those. You're coming through loud and clear, Jim. [Pause]
044:21:07 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, this is Houston.
044:21:08 Scott (GUMDROP): Go.
044:21:09 Roosa: We're going to drop off with Honeysuckle, here. You've got 60 degrees, and you've got about a tenth of a second rate. [Long pause]
044:21:26 Roosa: Gumdrop. Houston. You've got about 60 degrees of yaw.
Comm break.
MERCURY (REV 28)
044:23:05 Scott (GUMDROP): Who's in the tunnel now?
044:23:09 McDivitt (SPIDER): Stand by. We're going to check [garble].
044:23:12 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay.
044:23:17 Scott (GUMDROP): [Garble] Spider [garble]. [Long pause]
044:23:40 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, we've got you trough Mercury now. [Pause]
044:23:50 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger, Houston. Spider here. How do you read?
044:23:54 Roosa: I'm reading you okay, Spider.
044:23:58 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. We sure had a lot of static and noise coming up on the S-band there over Carnarvon. [Pause]
044:24:06 McDivitt (SPIDER): Or make that Honeysuckle.
044:24:09 Roosa: Roger, Spider. We'll try to solve that. You were coming through here loud and clear after we got a main lobe lock on. [Pause]
044:24:19 McDivitt (SPIDER): [Garble] all. I had a keyhole static and a steady high tone on it. [Pause]
044:24:26 Roosa: Roger. Understand you had a high tone. [Pause]
044:24:37 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, we're showing you at 60 degrees.
044:24:40 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Thanks. I've got a hold of it now, and I think the trend looks like we'll clear it fine.
044:24:47 Roosa: Roger. Thanks.
Comm break.
044:26:29 McDivitt (SPIDER): And, Gumdrop to Spider.
044:26:31 Scott (GUMDROP): Go ahead.
044:26:32 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger, we're ready to start reinstalling.
044:26:35 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. Drogue's in. [Long pause]
044:27:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, tape, we're starting the hatch installation and it's 44:27:00. Starting the tunnel closeout I should say.
044:27:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Dave, I don't guess you'll need me for anything, do you? Oh, shoot, he can't read me.
044:27:25 Schweickart (SPIDER): Dave, I guess you don't need me for anything more in the tunnel here. I'll go ahead and close up our hatch.
044:27:29 Scott (GUMDROP): I'd like for you to check the capture latches.
044:27:31 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay.
044:27:32 Schweickart (SPIDER): I'm up here waiting for you.
044:27:35 Scott (GUMDROP): Be right up.
044:27:38 Schweickart (SPIDER): Yes. I see your problem.
044:27:40 Scott (GUMDROP): Boy, I tell you these hoses are really something.
Comm break.
044:28:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Sure getting a lot of noise on the S-band.
044:28:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Are we?
044:28:44 McDivitt (SPIDER): Houston, Spider.
044:28:46 Roosa: Go, Spider.
044:28:48 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. We're picking up an awful lot of noise and static on the S-band again here.
044:28:54 Roosa: Roger. Understand. Gumdrop, are you getting it also?
044:29:00 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Not bad. [Pause]
044:29:06 Roosa: Did you say you were not getting it bad there?
044:29:08 Scott (GUMDROP): No, I'm not getting it bad; Gumdrop sounds clear. Sounds like your standard S-band pass, Houston.
044:29:14 Roosa: Okay. Copy that. Did you copy, Spider?
044:29:18 McDivitt (SPIDER): Yes [garble] I copied.
044:29:23 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay, Davy. I'm right here.
044:29:28 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. [Long pause]
044:30:00 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. That looks like it did it.
044:30:02 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. I give a pull, and it feels solid.
044:30:04 Schweickart (SPIDER): Yes. On all three [garble].
044:30:07 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay.
044:30:08 Schweickart (SPIDER): Fine. See you later; I'm going to close the door.
044:30:11 Scott (GUMDROP): All righty. Have a nice time.
044:30:13 Schweickart (SPIDER): We will.
044:30:14 Scott (GUMDROP): I'll get dinner ready when you're ready.
044:30:16 Schweickart (SPIDER): Man, am I hungry! [Long pause]
044:30:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, let's go back to - oop. Where did the clip go that was on it?
044:30:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I don't know.
044:30:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, shoot. Well, I'll let you read it to me.
044:30:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you got the hatch closed?
044:30:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, I haven't. Is that - Is that's - what's next? Close the hatch; is that next?
044:30:52 Scott (GUMDROP): Houston, Gumdrop.
044:30:53 Roosa: Go, Gumdrop.
044:30:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right.
044:30:55 Scott (GUMDROP): How much longer do we have you here?
044:30:57 Roosa: Okay. We're going to have you here for about another 3 minutes, and then we're coming up over Antigua at about 53. And I would like to pass to Spider, also, that we would like to try to pick up a nominal Flight Plan at Antigua with the secondary S-Band check. We are recommending eliminating the COMM checks and whatever you have to do to pick up the Flight Plan at that time. [Pause]
044:31:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Tell him I think that's a great idea.
044:31:29 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay, Houston. We read you. This is Spider.
044:31:33 Roosa: Okay.
044:31:34 Scott (GUMDROP): What time is that pass at Antigua?
044:31:35 Roosa: Okay. Antigua will be at 53.
044:31:39 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. We'll be ready for you.
044:31:40 Roosa: Okay.
044:31:41 Scott (GUMDROP): Gumdrop copies.
044:31:42 Roosa: And, Spider, we have no good data for that AOT star visibility check. We'll have to eliminate that, and so you could leave your rendezvous radar stowed if you want to. [Pause]
044:31:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] ...
044:32:00 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Understand.
044:32:02 Roosa: And we'll see you over Antigua, docking on ready. [Pause]
044:32:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, what ...
044:32:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay [garble].
044:32:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): The hatch is closed and locked.
044:32:09 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger.
044:32:12 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, I know with all the activity I'd like to remind you of your CO2 cartridge change that's due at 44:10.
044:32:21 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. I'll have to get the tunnel closed up first, but I'll get it first chance.
044:32:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Why don't you read the rest of it, Rusty?
044:32:25 Roosa: Roger. No sweat. I just wanted to pass it to you.
044:32:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
044:32:29 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. Thank you. [Pause]
044:32:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CABIN DUMP VALVE to AUTO.
044:32:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): CABIN DUMP VALVE going to AUTO.
044:32:36 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. Would you go low bit rate?
044:32:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. CABIN REPRESS to AUTO.
044:32:40 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Go on low bit rate.
Very long comm break.
044:32:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): CABIN REPRESS to AUTO. Clunk. Okay, we're AUTO.
044:32:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Boy, we got a lot of nuts and bolts around this thing.
044:32:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes [garble] we sure do. Okay, CABIN REPRESS is AUTO.
044:32:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, PRESS REGS A and B to CABIN.
044:33:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): PRESS REGS A and B to CABIN. PRESS REG A; PRESS REG B, CABIN.
044:33:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, CABIN FAN CONTROL, CLOSE. Got it.
044:33:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
044:33:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Look at this washer.
044:33:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Well, that's a good place for it. Okay, what's next?
044:33:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Glycol pump check.
044:33:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
044:33:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Except that's supposed to be done over the ground.
044:33:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well ...
044:33:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's desirable over the ground, but not mandatory.
044:33:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's do it. Let's do it now.
044:33:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): R&D INSTRUMENTATION A, CLOSE. They might be ON; go ahead and do it.
044:33:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): R&D INSTRUMENTATION A, CLOSE.
044:33:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): DFI POWER, ON.
044:33:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): DFI POWER, ON.
044:33:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): GLYCOL PUMP to 1 - GLYCOL PUMP 1, OPEN; excuse me.
044:33:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): GLYCOL PUMP 1, OPEN.
044:33:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. What was that? That was DFI POWER, ON.
044:34:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, that was MAS - that was GLYCOL PUMP 1, OPEN. I got that.
044:34:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, okay.
044:34:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Why don't we have a component light on there?
044:34:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Because you didn't push in the circuit breaker yet. GLYCOL PUMP 1, CLOSED.
044:34:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, yes.
044:34:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we got the component light. INSTRUMENTATION, SECONDARY.
044:34:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
044:34:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, and it's 7. Wow!
This is Apollo Control, 44 hours, 34 minutes ground elapsed time. We've had LOS at the tracking ship Mercury. Coming up toward the end of the first - or the beginning of the next revolution over Antigua, Vanguard, Canary Island and Madrid - at that time, some adjustments will likely be made in the Flight Plan to get back on the time line. Acquisition time for Antigua will be 52 minutes, 39 seconds past the hour. At 44 hours, 34 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control.
044:34:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It really comes on, doesn't it.
044:34:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Good.
044:34:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
044:34:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, now it's OPEN. GLYCOL PUMP to 2. [Garble] is out of [garble] again.
044:34:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ECS GLYCOL PUMP AUTO TRANSFER, OPEN.
044:35:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ECS GLYCOL PUMP AUTO TRANSFER, OPEN.
044:35:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, going to PUMP 1. Okay, there's PUMP 1. GLYCOL PUMP, AUTO TRANSFER, CLOSED.
044:35:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): AUTO TRANSFER CLOSED.
044:35:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): R&D TELEMETRY GAL, ON for 15 seconds.
044:35:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, ON.
044:35:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Maybe you turn that DFI on, it heats the glycol up to the point where it puts on the light.
044:35:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Huh!
044:35:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, go ahead.
044:35:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay ...
044:35:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): DFI POWER, OFF.
044:35:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): DFI POWER, OFF. R&D INSTRUMENTATION A, OPEN.
044:35:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): A, OPEN.
044:35:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Ohhhh, boy. This tape re - You want to get this stuff behind me?
044:35:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Sure, I'll get all that stuff, Rusty. You just read it to me, I'll [garble].
044:36:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, SUIT GAS DIVERTER. Pull to EGRESS. This is - a pressure integrity check.
044:36:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): PULL/EGRESS.
044:36:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CABIN GAS RETURN to EGRESS.
044:36:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): CABIN - Oh, CABIN GAS RETURN, EGRESS. Roger, EGRESS.
044:36:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): SUIT RELEASE, CLOSE.
044:36:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): CLOSE.
044:36:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): PRESS REG A, CLOSE.
044:36:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): PRESS REG A, going CLOSED.
044:36:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): PRESS REG B, DIRECT O2.
044:36:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): DIRECT O2. Okay, you ready?
044:36:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Ready.
044:36:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): How you feeling? Okay? Alrighty. If you start feeling ragged, give me a holler and I'll just let you rest.
044:37:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you want to go to CLOSE, when we get to 8.85.
044:37:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I can't see it very well.
044:37:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'll - I'll let you know. We're at 8 now.
044:37:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
044:37:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, that's 8.85, essentially.
044:37:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Alrighty, CLOSE.
044:37:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, the timer is counting. I'm reading 4.01, or something like that.
044:38:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'm 4.05.
044:38:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
044:38:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] a minute we want to read it again. Should be less than 0.3. And you want to go - CO2 CANISTER to SECONDARY, right away.
044:38:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
044:38:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Boy, my throat is really dry.
044:38:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, mine too. I'd sure like to get some water and something to eat.
044:38:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I don't know if I'm hungry or not.
044:38:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, my stomach is just dead [garble].
044:38:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'm reading 3.95.
044:38:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, me too.
044:38:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you got about 5 more seconds. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
044:38:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Go to SECONDARY.
044:38:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): SECONDARY.
044:39:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, and it's reading 3.75 now.
044:39:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
044:39:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And we'll time that.
044:39:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It felt nice and cool over here in the LM when I came over - with my helmet off.
044:39:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): The temp is 68. Another 30 seconds.
044:39:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's going to make it, too.
044:39:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] seconds.
044:39:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
044:39:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And at that point, let me tell you what you're going to do.
044:40:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, time's up.
044:40:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, and it made it. CO2 CANISTERS, SELECT, PRIME.
044:40:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): PRIME.
044:40:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] lights, OFF. SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF to AUTO.
044:40:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF to AUTO.
044:40:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): PRESS REGS A and B to CABIN.
044:40:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): PRESS REGS A and B to CABIN.
044:40:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CABIN GAS RETURN to AUTO.
044:40:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): CABIN GAS RETURN to AUTO.
044:40:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And SUIT GAS DIVERTER, PUSH to CABIN.
044:40:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Ready?
044:40:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Ready. Wow! That's like, now.
044:40:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
044:40:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): SUIT CONTROL - Okay, I'd the better get out a pen here. That's in FULL COLD on the SUIT and NORMAL on the CABIN.
044:40:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): FULL COLD on the SUIT, let's see this ...
044:40:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, that's where it is; I'm ...
044:40:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh. Okay.
044:41:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... not asking you to put it there.
044:41:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, regulator check is next. Let me see what ...
044:41:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, we have about 12 minutes. Why don't we configure the S-band so that we're ready to support that thing? And then come back and we'll start the REG checks and stuff like that. We can pick these up later.
044:41:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. As a matter of fact, if we don't have to use this card anymore ...
044:41:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] have any steerable antennas, so he wanted the backup voice, okay?
044:42:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): He what? I thought they wanted secondary S-band check at Antigua on the Flight Plan? Right here.
044:42:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] the secondary S-band checks.
044:42:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
044:42:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. We'll be ready to pick them up.
044:42:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Very good. Clip, hot dog. Alright, and we're ...
044:42:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Why don't we do the ascent battery activation and checkout, right now?
044:42:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, we just did the pressure integrity check.
044:42:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, we can catch that regulator check some other time.
044:42:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
044:42:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's see, that's the thing we have the new checksheet for, isn't it?
044:43:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, I know what it is, if you want me to just go ahead and do it.
044:43:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Why don't you.
044:43:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. DESCENT ECA CONTROL, CLOSED. Excuse me, ASCENT ECA CONTROL, CLOSED.
044:43:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, here it is - here it is here - ASCENT ECA CONTROL, CLOSED; PYRO TEMP MONITOR, BAT 5.
044:43:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 5.
044:43:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): BAT 5, NORMAL FEED, ON ...
044:43:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Ney, how about turning up the EL? Okay. Thank you. Okay, 5 coming on.
044:43:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What in heaven's name is that?
044:43:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It's on. Going to 6. 6 is ON. Okay, now - 1, 2, 3, 4, OFF. Right?
044:43:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right, yes.
044:43:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 1, OFF.
044:43:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 2 going OFF.
044:43:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 3 going OFF.
044:44:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 4 going OFF.
044:44:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): And the current should be zero.
044:44:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, let me look at BATS 5 and 6. 5 is reading 27; 6 is reading 24. [Garble] pretty good. Okay, now we go to BACKUP FEEDS, right?
044:44:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, BACKUP FEEDS, both, ON.
044:44:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): PRIMARY FEEDS, OFF.
044:44:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): PRIMARY FEEDS, both, OFF; RESET.
044:44:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, looks the same.
044:44:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] back ON.
044:44:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Roger. BATS coming back ON, then.
044:44:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ON ...
044:44:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Go ahead, Gumdrop.
044:44:53 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, the hatch is closed up; the probe works real good; the hatch works good. I'll just put the tunnel in DELTA-T, unless you want to run it in LM PRESS.
044:45:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We're pressurizing ourselves over here now, Dave. Hey, were you getting a lot of noise on VHF, then?
044:45:11 Scott (Spider onboard): No, but I seem to have a lot of noise - flow noise in here now.
044:45:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, I was getting an awful lot of static all of a sudden there.
044:45:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, when you get all those back on, Rusty.
044:45:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): A is 36.8. [Garble] 37.5.
044:45:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What's that? Oh ...
044:45:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): PYRO A ...
044:45:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): PYRO B.
044:45:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... and B.
044:45:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Say that again. I'll write it down.
044:45:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'll get it here.
044:45:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What is it? I got the pencil here, Rusty.
044:45:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 36.8, 37.5. [Garble] going to take this one back in now.
044:45:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
044:45:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Alrighthy. We got that done.
044:45:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Daylight AOT star visibility check. Oh, we're not going to get that done. I wonder what it looks like out through there?
044:46:07 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, Jim, you want to vent the tunnel, or do you want to leave it full?
044:46:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It doesn't make any difference, Dave, I don't think.
044:46:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, when we make our REG checks ...
044:46:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes ...
044:46:26 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble] hatch the [garble] check is to vent the tunnel.
044:46:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, why don't you go ahead and vent it?
044:46:29 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, we'll see how it works.
044:46:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Are you going to suggest whether ...
044:46:32 Scott (Spider onboard): Is your dump valve in AUTO?
044:46:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Roger, we're all configured.
044:46:36 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay.
044:46:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we pick up the Antigua at 53, right?
044:46:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Roger.
044:46:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We have 7 minutes. Let's do something useful. You want to start that REG check?
044:46:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 'What the hell is that out there [garble] the tunnel. Well ...
044:47:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I don't know. That REG check takes us up and down here.
044:47:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
044:47:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Stay in BACKUP VOICE; S-band steerable antenna check - we don't need that.
044:47:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We've done the glycol pump check, haven't we?
044:47:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
044:47:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble], get that checked off.
044:47:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We have the window shades on yet? Drogues and probe installation, OPS check and LM OVERHEAD HATCH, CLOSED; we've done that. Done that.
044:47:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's just stand by until we get to Antigua.
044:47:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Why don't you look ahead of that, Jim; and see what we can do?
044:47:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, we got to get the PLSS out. Get the PLSS PREP, install the ISA. Wonder where we install that?
044:48:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, stow the - stow the OPS.
044:48:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, yes, that's what we didn't do.
044:48:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. And get these helmets out of here. That's what - that's something we can do. Tell you, I wish I could help you, but I don't ...
044:48:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, that's okay. You can help me more by just being able to continue reading the checklist. [Garble] straps that go - around this thing here. For the ...
This is Apollo Control at 44 hours 52 minutes ground elapse time. We're a few seconds away from acquisition at the Antigua tracking station lapping over Vanguard, Canary Island, and Madrid for a total time of about 20 minutes. We'll stand by for Stu Roosas call to the crew and subsequent conversation three way between the ground here in mission control and Gum Drop and Spider. Still no attempt yet by CAP COM Stu Roosa to talk to the crew. Should be placing a call shortly, here he goes.
ANTIGUA (REV 29)
044:53:51 Roosa: Hello, Spider. This is Houston. How do you read?
044:53:54 Schweickart (SPIDER): You're five-square, Houston. How me?
044:53:56 Roosa: Oh, you're coming in great, Spider. How are you doing? [Pause]
044:54:04 Roosa: And, Spider, we're standing by for the secondary S-band check at your convenience.
044:54:09 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Power AMP going off now.
044:54:12 Roosa: Roger. [Long pause]
044:54:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Tape, ON ... Okay, tape, we're doing the secondary S-band check. And it's - 44:54:20.
044:54:25 Scott (GUMDROP): And, Houston, Gumdrop here. The tunnel is closed off, and everything works just like it should.
044:54:31 Roosa: Roger, Gumdrop. Thank you, [Pause]
044:54:41 McDivitt (SPIDER): And, Houston, this is Spider. How do you read?
044:54:45 Roosa: We're reading you loud and clear, Spider. We've had data drop out here; let's hang loose and see if we can get our data check.
044:54:54 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. [Pause]
044:55:02 Scott (GUMDROP): I could hear your data drop out.
044:55:03 Roosa: Very good. [Pause]
044:55:14 Roosa: And, Spider, this is Houston. Could you give us high bit rate?
044:55:18 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Going high. [Long pause]
044:55:36 Roosa: Okay, Spider. We'll have to hang loose here for a minute. I'm getting your VHF down. We don't have a good lock on S-band.
044:55:43 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. [Pause]
044:55:48 Roosa: And while we are waiting, could you comment on if you accomplished the - With the exception of the COMM check, are you up on the Flight Plan now?
044:56:00 McDivitt (SPIDER): We got the glycol check done and a suit integrity check done. We have not accomplished a regulator check or the rest of the COMM or the daylight star visibility.
044:56:12 Roosa: Okay. We are scrubbing the daylight star visibility and the COMM check. How about your ascent batteries?
044:56:18 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. The ascent batteries checked out okay, and the pyros. You ready to copy?
044:56:23 Roosa: Go ahead.
044:56:24 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. 36.8, 37.5 - A and B.
044:56:28 Roosa: Roger. Copy. 36.8 and 37.5. Thank you.
044:56:33 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. [Pause]
044:56:40 McDivitt (SPIDER): And for your information, the ascent batteries were sharing just about equally.
044:56:46 Roosa: Roger. Understand. [Pause]
044:56:56 Roosa: And, Spider. We have got our data check. Let's go on with the secondary S-band check, step 2.
044:57:03 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Power AMP going to SECONDARY.
044:57:10 Roosa: Roger. [Pause]
044:57:21 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. And we are on secondary transmitter/receiver. How do you read?
044:57:25 Roosa: Roger. I'm reading you loud and clear. Let me verify that it is S-band, Spider.
044:57:33 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. [Long pause]
044:57:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You want me to lift that, Jim?
044:57:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No. I can get it out, I think.
044:58:14 Roosa: And, Spider, this is Houston. Let's go on to step 3.
044:58:19 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. [Long pause]
044:58:46 McDivitt (SPIDER): And Houston. We are back in primary primary, and be advised on the primary transmitter/receiver, I've got squeal.
044:58:56 Roosa: Roger. Understand you're primary primary, and there is a squeal. You're coming through loud and clear here without any static at all. Let's stand by for data. I will give you call.
044:59:07 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger.
044:59:08 Roosa: And Spider. Also, we'd like to - at your convenience get an E memory dump in here. It's a little ahead of schedule, but we'd like to get it now if you can give us a VERB 74 sometime on your Mark.
044:59:20 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Stand by. [Pause]
044:59:30 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. 3, 2, 1.
044:59:32 McDivitt (SPIDER): MARK. [Pause]
044:59:39 Roosa: Roger. We got your - we got your Mark. We'll stand by and see if we got it. We might have you repeat it again shortly; and let me see if we are through with this check. [Long pause]
044:59:59 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. We have completed the secondary S-band check.
045:00:01 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. [Long pause]
045:00:15 Roosa: And, Spider. If you have still got the squeal on primary, let's go secondary on your transmitter/receiver.
045:00:23 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. It has gone away now. We'll see how it works.
045:00:27 Roosa: Okay. Thank you.
Comm break.
045:00:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Phewee!
045:00:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] work back there, isn't it?
045:00:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, boy. This thing doesn't fit, Rusty. This God-blessed netting is all screwed up. Oh, I almost broke by God-blessed finger off. Now I got it out; I'm never going to get it back in there.
045:01:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] netting?
045:01:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, no, that's one - Oh, boy, the guy that sent that piece of machinery up ought to get his God-blessed head caved in. It simply no more fits than the man in the Moon. I can't even push that handle back and forth without the thing being in there. I get all fouled up in there. The trouble is, if I leave it like that and get a little vibration, that mother's going to shake loose.
045:01:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, hell's bells. All I got to do is touch it, and it comes right out. Will my feet bash anything they shouldn't?
045:02:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, you're sticking them in the guards; that's okay. I'll keep them away from the controllers.
045:02:07 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston. We'll have you now for about another 12 minutes.
045:02:15 Scott (GUMDROP): Gumdrop. Roger.
045:02:18 McDivitt (SPIDER): Spider. Roger
Comm break.
045:02:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, boy. Phew! Phew!
045:02:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Don't overdo it.
045:02:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Well, Rusty, I don't know what the heck else I can do with that thing.
045:02:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, boy.
045:02:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] handle won't turn, huh?
045:02:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, I can't push it in.
045:02:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, my God, we got an OPS floating up here. I got to let go of something and grab it.
045:02:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'll ...
045:02:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I got it.
045:03:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I don't know where that strap is either. This is really neat.
045:03:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] use a bunch of these.
045:03:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I tried the other one here. And I had it strapped on one time; it just got out, that's all. It doesn't fit, you know, and ...
045:03:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's why I say use these, because you can adjust them a lot better.
045:03:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, the other one was adjusted pretty well.
045:03:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): The strap's still there.
045:03:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Ohhhh. Well, I'll just - I'll just put it through one of these other snaps on here.
045:04:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, there, that's strapped down.
045:04:46 Roosa: Spider, Houston. We'd like to know when you are going to deploy the landing gear. We'd like to have a Mark on it and would like to get it before we lose you at Madrid in about 8 minutes, if possible.
045:04:59 McDivitt (SPIDER): Right away.
045:05:01 McDivitt (SPIDER): It will be pretty close to the end.
045:05:04 Roosa: Okay.
Long comm break.
045:05:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, let me get the camera.
045:05:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
045:05:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What do we need? We need the 5-millimeter lens, don't we?
045:05:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, 18 ...
045:05:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, the 18-millimeter lens, don't wet
045:05:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I'm [garble] my gloves off, Jim.
045:05:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Go ahead.
045:05:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble]. This is indoor, too. Shoot, we're - we're really well equipped.
045:05:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, Rusty, here's the camera. Let me get the film.
045:06:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Stand by. I'll be right with you, Jim.
045:06:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
045:06:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I got it.
045:06:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): What are you looking for, Jim?
045:06:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): The film.
045:06:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Didn't we transfer one?
045:06:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, we brought an indoor one over with us.
045:06:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you got it?
045:06:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, shoot. How do we unseal this thing? Oh, there we go. Well, S comes before T, let's try that.
045:07:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey -
045:07:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh! Something else won't lock.
045:07:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] you're really bashing things.
045:07:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I know it. Especially my helmet. There it is.
045:08:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You got it?
045:08:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
045:08:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hello, world.
CANARY (REV 28)
045:08:22 McDivitt (SPIDER): Hey, Gumdrop, this is Spider. We're going to deploy the landing gear in a few minutes here, so you'll probably feel big bang.
045:08:28 Scott (GUMDROP): Sounds good.
045:08:31 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. [Pause]
045:08:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Shoot.
045:08:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, where is that?
045:08:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Ahhhh, come on.
045:08:41 Scott (GUMDROP): You might stand back and give me a minute, will you? [Pause]
045:08:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): LANDING GEAR DEPLOY.
045:08:52 Roosa: Gumdrop and Spider. Insure S-band volume up. We'll be going over to Madrid shortly.
045:08:58 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. How long do we have before you want the gear down?
045:09:00 Roosa: We're ready any time.
045:09:05 McDivitt (SPIDER): How long do we have?
045:09:06 Roosa: Okay. You've got about another 5 minutes before we'll lose you at Madrid.
045:09:12 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay.
Comm break.
045:09:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We'll be ready.
045:09:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Unstow, adjust, and lock the sequence camera above the right window. 18-millimeter lens; CEX368 MAG; 24 frames per second; f:4 - 11 - f:11 at 1/250th; 20 feet. CB(11): ED LOGIC POWER A, OPEN. LOGIC POWER A, OPEN. R&D INSTRUMENTATION A, CLOSE. DFI POWER, ON.
045:09:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, hell, I can't tell my frame speed, hold on.
045:09:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): DFI POWER's coming ON, Rusty.
045:09:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
045:10:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, the camera's ready.
045:10:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
045:10:22 Roosa: And, Spider. For your info we - DFI, we cannot read at Madrid, so we've only got about another minute here on Canaries to monitor that gear. [Pause]
045:10:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you ready?
045:10:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Okay, Dave, we are going to do it very quickly.
045:10:36 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay, Dave. We'll do it very quickly.
045:10:37 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay.
045:10:38 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. [Long pause]
045:10:39 McDivitt (Spider onboard): DFI POWER, ON; MASTER ARM coming ON.
045:10:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Did you get the LOGIC A, OPEN?
045:10:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): LOGIC A is OPEN.
045:10:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, MASTER ARM, ON; SEQUEICE CAMERA, CLOSED, I got that.
045:10:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
045:10:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you can give him a count, Jim, if you want. I've got the camera ready.
045:10:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay - Put this around.
045:10:53 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Houston, this is Spider. You ready? [Pause]
045:10:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): He has to - Why don't you watch it, too.
045:10:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I'm going to. LANDING GEAR DEPLOY.
045:11:03 Roosa: We're ready.
045:11:06 McDivitt (SPIDER): Houston, Spider. Do you read?
045:11:09 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. Read you loud and clear. We are ready. Go ahead and deploy the gear. [Pause]
045:11:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, he's talking, Jim.
045:11:16 McDivitt (SPIDER): 3, 2, 1.
045:11:18 McDivitt (SPIDER): MARK. [Pause]
045:11:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble].
045:11:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, Houston. I've got a gray [garble] talkback, and I've got a gear out in front of me. I don't hear them. Hope they're on.
045:11:26 Scott (GUMDROP): Spider, Gumdrop.
MADRID (REV 29)
045:11:27 McDivitt (SPIDER): Dave, [garble] I've got [garble]. [Pause]
045:11:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Sure do. Okay, the camera's OFF; LANDING GEAR DEPLOY, FIRE; SEQUENCE CAMERA, OFF; GET is 45:11:35.
045:11:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): GO.
045:11:44 Scott (GUMDROP): Spider, Gumdrop. Okay. I think they copied you. They were listening when you said 3, 2, 1; then I got a break lock [garble].
045:11:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
045:11:53 Roosa: Gumdrop -
045:11:54 Scott (GUMDROP): We've got one out here too, boy [garble].
045:11:55 Scott (Spider onboard): That snapped right on down there.
045:11:56 Roosa: Gumdrop and Spider, we copied you. We heard talk back gray, and you got a visual on the gear. [Long pause]
045:11:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Okay, we've got to finish out that sequence.
045:11:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, Roger. I'm going. Okay, ED LOGIC B coming OPEN. OPEN.
045:12:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
045:12:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): A, CLOSED.
045:12:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): A, CLOSED.
045:12:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): LANDING GEAR DEPLOY, FIRE.
045:12:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, Dave, I'm going to do it with the other pyro system now; you may hear a little bump. Okay, 3, 2, 1 -
045:12:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): FIRE.
045:12:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, ED LOGIC B, CLOSED.
045:12:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
045:12:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MASTER ARM, OFF.
045:12:31 Scott (GUMDROP): By the way, can you see me out your overhead window? Go ahead, don't let me bother you. [Long pause]
045:12:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Dave, I haven't had a chance to even look.
045:12:34 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
045:12:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, LOGIC B, CLOSED. I got MASTER ARM, OFF; LANDING GEAR FLAG, circuit breaker, Jim, OPEN. ED 11.
045:12:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
045:12:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): R&D TELEMETRY CAL, ON. Why don't you try that real quick?
045:12:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Okay.
045:12:54 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. Could you give us low bit rate?
045:12:56 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Going low bit rate, and we are going to CAL right now.
045:12:59 Roosa: Roger. Understand. We will see you over Carnarvon at 39.
045:13:04 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Did you get that gear extension, Houston?
045:13:07 Roosa: That's affirmative, Spider. It came through loud and clear. We are showing the relay closed, and I copied all your transmissions.
045:13:14 McDivitt (SPIDER): Thanks, Dave.
045:13:15 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. [Pause]
045:13:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, DFI - TELEMETRY CAL, OFF. That DFI POWER OFF now?
045:13:24 Roosa: Gumdrop, this is Houston. Could you give us your up-telemetry switch, your command to RESET and back to NORMAL? [Long pause]
045:13:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): DFI, OFF; R&D A, OFF.
045:13:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): DFI POWER, OFF; and R&D INSTRUMENT A, OFF?
045:13:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right.
045:13:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
045:13:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] on S-band, Jim, and you didn't hear them answer you.
045:13:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
045:13:42 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston. Could you give us RESET, back to NORMAL on your command reset? [Long pause]
045:13:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, PLSS prep.
045:13:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let me get the rest of this floor squared away.
045:14:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] a view and a half out the window, isn't it?
045:14:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, you got a real - picture window there.
045:14:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Watch your feet, Rusty.
045:14:16 Roosa: And we will see you at Carnarvon at 39, Gumdrop and Spider.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control 45 hours 14 minutes into the mission. Madrid has LOS. We are essentially back on the time line after eliminating some communication checks and a daylight star check. The landing gear has been deployed. We have verified that on the ground, as well as visual verification from Gumdrop. The LM cabin pressure is holding at 5.15 pounds per square inch. Cabin temperature is 67 degrees. Gene Kranz's White Team has relieved the Orange Team, led by Flight Director Pete Frank. We are estimating the change of shift briefing for 8 am central standard time. The next station to acquire will be Carnarvon at 45 hours 39 minutes. This is Mission Control Houston.
045:14:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, I haven't found anything in this God-blessed thing that fits yet.
045:14:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, those aren't exactly flush, but they're down pretty well.
045:15:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Just a second, Rusty, I'll be right with you. Shoot, come on water gun.
045:15:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You alright, there? Okay. If you're in any - if you're in any trouble, wiggle your head, if you're not, just - okay? You want me to wipe your mouth off, if -
045:15:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
045:15:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): - how about your nose here?
045:16:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
045:16:42 Scott (Spider onboard): Spider, I've been unable to reach you [garble].
045:16:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, that's okay, Dave. Okay?
045:16:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
045:17:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'll get you my other chin strap here in a minute, this one of yours is kind of beat up. Here, I'll tell you what. If you - if you want to use this, I'll go down and get a - a clean towel, and I'll put some cold water on it for you, okay?
045:17:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. (clearing throat)
045:17:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): If I remember where the heck they were.
045:17:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I sure feel a lot better afterwards.
045:18:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Sorry.
045:18:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's okay, Rusty. Everybody has a problem. I think though, we're going to have to talk to Houston, and tell them what ours is. And ...
045:18:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. (clearing throat)
045:18:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ... I think we ought to - seriously consider - as a matter of fact, I'm going to recommend we scrub the EVA tomorrow.
045:18:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, I think that's a good idea.
045:18:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I know how you want to do it, I think - maybe we'll - let you stay back in the command module with Dave, and I'll come over here, and we'll run through the check list, open up the cabin. Don't sweat it though.
045:18:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Why don't you go ahead and take your gloves off? (clearing throat)
045:18:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Here. How's that? Does that help, or is that just making you ...
045:19:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, that's okay. Don't shake me too much, though.
045:19:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
045:19:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Because I've got something in my hand here I don't want to let go of.
045:19:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Let me - let me use this for just a minute.
045:19:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, Dave?
045:19:39 Scott (Spider onboard): Go ahead.
045:19:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What's the next time we get acquisition at the ground?
045:19:43 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
045:19:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I don't know how we're going to clean this up now.
045:19:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, we'll - figure something.
045:19:58 Scott (Spider onboard): About 45 [garble] which is 20 minutes from now [garble].
045:20:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, I guess nobody's listening. Hey, Rusty got sick again, I think - I'm going to have to call Houston; we're going to have to have a little discussion about this. I think we're going to have to scrub the EVA for tomorrow for sure. But I think we probably ought to try to at least do the CABIN DEPRESS. We might want to do it at the end of today, and then just take tomorrow off.
045:20:21 Scott (Spider onboard): Yes, that might not be a bad idea.
045:20:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Too bad we don't have that ...
045:20:38 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
045:20:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, not at all. Thank you.
045:20:43 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay.
045:20:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I wonder if - Let's see, we have a tissue dispenser in here someplace.
045:21:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Dave, as soon as we get contact with Houston, tell them I want to go PRIVATE with them.
045:21:06 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
045:21:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, I'm going to be - I'll probably not be talking much here for a couple of minutes.
045:21:12 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, I'll let Houston know [garble] get squared away.
045:21:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): How's your stomach feeling? Is it feeling any better?
045:21:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, it feels fine now.
045:21:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You want me to undo your chin strap for you there?
045:21:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
045:21:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'll just - I'm sorry, I'm going to have to gouge you a little bit there.
045:22:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, do you want to let it float or do you want to ...
045:22:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'd get that Kleenex for you, if I knew where it was. It's over on your side, someplace up there.
045:22:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): (clearing his throat). Now we got to stow this stuff somewhere.
045:22:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I know it. I'll be with you in just a minute, Rusty.
045:23:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's really funny, Jim. Because both cases there, it's not because I'm moving; I can feel it way down in my stomach.
045:23:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Uh huh.
045:23:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It feels like there is something that I ate ...
045:23:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well ...
045:23:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... or something I took.
045:23:39 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
045:23:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): One or the other.
045:23:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] my stomach's been gurgling an awful lot, too. I think it's from that water.
045:23:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, I'm worried about that - I'm still wondering about that bacon. It might be the water, too. I don't know.
045:23:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's see, we got to do something with that. Tell you what.
045:24:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): With what?
045:24:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): With that - stuff you have in your hands there.
045:25:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, great.
045:25:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, shoot. It's not very big, Rusty.
045:25:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): What is it?
045:25:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's the bag that the water gun was in.
045:25:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's a pretty clean one. I'll just stow this.
045:25:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): (clearing throat)
045:26:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Thank you.
045:26:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I don't know where your clip went.
045:26:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's okay. It's around somewhere. Why don't you just get comfortable, there, and don't do anything.
045:26:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hell, I'm feeling good, Jim.
045:26:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Well, why don't you just rest for awhile, and not - not bother doing anything. I think we'll scrub most of these COMM checks here - a few of them until we get organized here.
045:26:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, no, no I'm - I'm serious ...
045:26:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, we're going to have to get the PLSS out.
045:26:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right, let's go ahead and do that. Let me get - Let me clean off my chin strap here.
045:26:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I've got another one with me, I think.
045:26:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, that might be good. This one's kind of wet and soggy.
045:27:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, let me get it [garble].
045:27:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): There it is, back there. And there's the other one. Excuse me.
045:27:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Am I fairly well cleaned up?
045:28:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, you look pretty good.
045:28:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): (Clearing throat)
045:28:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Alrighty. Let me finish what I was doing, and get these helmet bags out of here.
045:28:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'm going to look ahead, here. Alright, the next thing is the PLSS COMM check with the LM mean - yes.
This is Apollo Control 45 hours 38 minutes into the mission. Gumdrop and Spider coming up on Carnarvon now. We will be running through a series of communications checks with the portable life support system, CSM one-way relays, and LM one-way relays. Stand by.
CARNARVON (REV 29)
045:38:58 Roosa: Hello, Gumdrop and Spider. This is Houston trough Carnarvon.
045:39:04 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Go.
045:39:05 McDivitt (SPIDER): [Garble] I would like to go private with you.
045:39:08 Roosa: You cut each other out there. Say again, please. [Pause]
045:39:15 McDivitt (SPIDER): I'll get it, Dave. Houston, this is Spider, I would like to go private with you, please.
045:39:22 Roosa: Roger. Understand. Will do. [Long pause]
045:39:45 Roosa: Okay, Spider. It will be a couple of minutes here.
045:39:49 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay.
Comm break.
045:41:51 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. Do you read?
045:41:55 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. I read you.
045:41:56 Roosa: Okay. We're all configured for a private talk, Jim.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We have had a request from the crew for a private conversation. We will take this line down and come back up as soon as possible.
HONEYSUCKLE (REV 29)
045:52:51 Scott (GUMDROP): Hello, Houston. This is [garble]. [Pause]
This is Apollo Control at 45 hours 53 minutes into the mission. The private conversation has been concluded. We do not know the nature or content of it yet. That conversation did not come into the Control room; however, the crew is back in normal communications now. We will come up live with the remainder of this Honeysuckle pass. As soon as we have some information on the private conversation we will report that.
045:53:07 Roosa: Hello, Spider. Did you call? This is Houston. [Long pause]
045:53:23 Roosa: Gumdrop, this is Houston. How do you read through Honeysuckle?
045:53:27 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger, Houston. You're five-by.
045:53:30 Roosa: Roger. I believe Spider called. We may be having S-band troubles with him again. Can you read me, Spider? [Pause]
045:53:40 Scott (GUMDROP): Spider, Gumdrop. Could you try and call Houston? They're reading you.
045:53:44 McDivitt (SPIDER): No, I'm not reading Houston at all. Roger. I just wanted to tell them that we're going to try to complete that TV pass over Houston with the PLSS. And at that time, we're going to try taking the PLSS apart, and that will be the end of the COMM check.
045:53:59 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. I copy that, and what I'm recommending is that we configure for that mode 10 over Mercury. We will have about an 11-minute pass, over Mercury, and we will get all set up then, and then we will be ready to go when we come into the States. [Pause]
045:54:25 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. Spider, Gumdrop. What he wants you do is - He understood what you said. He would like for you to configure for the mode 10 over Mercury so you can get all set up to get about an 11-minute pass here.
045:54:41 Roosa: Gumdrop, this is Houston. If they will not be ready for that, it's no problem. We've still got you here at Honeysuckle for about 5 minutes. We will have you at Mercury for 11.
045:54:52 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. He got it, Houston. He said Roger, and I assume they'll be able to do that for you.
045:54:56 Roosa: Okay. Very good.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 45 hours 58 minutes. We have loss of signal at Honeysuckle. The change of shift briefing, estimated for 8 o'clock has been delayed. We do not have a new time estimate at this time. We will notify you as soon as we do have a time. Mercury will be the next station to acquire at 46 hours. This is Mission Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 46 hours 01 minutes, and we are at Mercury.
MERCURY (REV 29)
046:01:58 Roosa: Hello, Spider. This is Houston. Could you give a high bit rate, please! [Pause]
046:02:07 Scott (GUMDROP): Spider, Houston wants high bit rate. [Long pause]
046:02:26 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston. Did he copy you?
046:02:29 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. He said he'd get it in just a minute.
046:02:31 Roosa: Okay. Evidently, I'm not getting anything out of him. I'll check the site.
046:02:36 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay.
046:02:39 McDivitt (SPIDER): This is Spider. [Pause]
046:02:46 Scott (GUMDROP): Houston, Gumdrop. Spider says he's reading you five-by now.
046:02:50 Roosa: Roger. Understand. Spider, can you give me a transmission? Hoy do you read me?
046:02:55 McDivitt (SPIDER): I'm reading you loud and clear. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
046:02:59 Roosa: Okay. I'm reading you real good. We've got 8 minutes in this pass, and if you'd like to get set up for the LM two-way relay and adjust your VOX and so forth, I can give you a count any time you want it and get yours. Let me know when you are going to that configuration. [Pause]
046:03:30 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger, Houston. We'll be with you in a minute. Stand by.
046:03:34 Roosa: Roger. Standing by. [Long pause]
046:04:14 McDivitt (SPIDER): And, Houston, we're going FM now.
046:04:16 Roosa: Roger. Go on FM. [Long pause]
046:04:28 Roosa: And, Gumdrop and Spider, be advised I'm going to go to our test configuration, which will be LM S-band only back to Houston. And, Mercury M and O, this is Houston CAP COMM. Would you inhibit my VHF uplink and remote LM 8-band only. [Pause]
046:05:07 Roosa: And, Spider, this is Houston. If you read, could you give me antenna number 2, S-band antenna number 2? [Pause]
046:05:19 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. You've got 2. Do you want 1?
046:05:22 Roosa: Negative. Leave it in 2 right now, and I'm reading you okay.
046:05:26 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Roger. That's what you had all along.
046:05:29 Roosa: Okay. [Long pause]
046:05:49 Scott (GUMDROP): Why don't you go ahead and do it? [Pause]
046:05:59 McDivitt (SPIDER): [Garble].
046:06:03 Scott (GUMDROP): Take if off; what the hell. [Pause]
046:06:17 Schweickart (SPIDER): How'd you hear me?
046:06:18 Roosa: Okay, Spider. I got just the last part of that. How about a short count?
046:06:25 Schweickart (SPIDER): Were we active there?
046:06:30 Roosa: Okay, Spider. It's breaking ...-
046:06:33 Schweickart (SPIDER): It's in one? [Pause]
046:06:44 McDivitt (SPIDER): [Garble] COMM SC audio close.
046:06:47 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Just a minute. [Pause]
046:06:58 McDivitt (SPIDER): Unstowed. [Pause]
046:07:04 McDivitt (SPIDER): Audio for the LMP side. S-band and TI. ICS OFF. Relay ON. [Garble] outside RCS transmitter. [Pause]
046:07:19 Scott (GUMDROP): RCS transmitter.
046:07:20 McDivitt (SPIDER): Just VOX to about 8.
046:07:21 Scott (GUMDROP): VOX to about 8.
046:07:26 McDivitt (SPIDER): HF 8 a TR.
046:07:27 Scott (GUMDROP): A to TR.
046:07:30 McDivitt (SPIDER): B OFF.
046:07:32 Scott (GUMDROP): B OFF.
046:07:35 McDivitt (SPIDER): HF 8 scratched. Adjusted at CDR to hear CSM.
046:07:41 McDivitt (SPIDER): Gumdrop, Spider here. Give me a short count.
046:07:44 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger, Gumdrop. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Gumdrop out.
046:07:51 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Fine. That was good. Thank you.
046:07:52 Scott (GUMDROP): Say it again; you're broken to me.
046:07:55 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. I'm on VOX now. I said that was good. And, Gumdrop, we're configuring for the TV mode, which is mode 10. [Pause]
046:08:16 Scott (GUMDROP): I'm not hearing you at all, Jim.
046:08:22 McDivitt (SPIDER): Gumdrop, this is Spider. Do you read re?
046:08:26 Scott (GUMDROP): Do you have your audio on? [Pause]
046:08:35 Roosa: Gumdrop, did you hear Spider? He's calling.
046:08:36 McDivitt (SPIDER): Gumdrop, Spider. Do you read? [Pause]
046:08:45 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. How do you read? [Pause]
046:08:57 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger, Gumdrop. This is Spider. How do you read?
046:09:01 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay [garble].
046:09:03 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. We're configuring mode 10 COMM, which is the TV EMU relay.
046:09:09 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. [Garble].
046:09:10 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Very good. [Long pause]
046:09:35 Roosa: Okay, Spider and Gumdrop. It's about a minute - and a half to LOS here at Mercury. Your acquisition time at Texas is 25. [Pause]
046:09:56 McDivitt (SPIDER): There's our trouble.
046:10:01 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. Do you read? If you do, we are going to lose you in about a minute. Your acquisition time at Texas is 25. [Pause]
046:10:13 Schweickart (SPIDER): [Garble] 25.
046:10:15 Roosa: Okay. It will be 25, and then we'll have about 2 minutes at the MIN before the TV pass starts. [Pause]
046:10:26 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger.
046:10:28 Roosa: And, Spider, could you give us low bit rate? [Long pause]
046:10:56 Roosa: And, Spider, this is Houston. We'd like - We'd like to have low bit rate and data on VHF B until we get you.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 46 hours 11 minutes. Mercury has LOS. We do still anticipate this first television pass at an elapsed time of 46 hours 27 minutes, that's 8:27 am Central Standard Time, over the Florida tracking station. During this Mercury pass you heard a considerable amount of communications testing back and forth between the two spacecraft in various modes. Next station to acquire will be Texas at 46 hours 24 minutes. This is Mission Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 46 hours, 21 minutes. We have a report now on that private conversation. Rusty Schweickart felt some nausea a few hours ago, but he is feeling better now. He told doctors that he had an upset stomach and had vomited. He emphasized that his nausea had cleared and is feeling all right now. The flight crew and the flight controllers here on the ground in Houston have agreed to continue with the flight as planned. The change of shift briefing originally scheduled for 8' o clock will begin after the TV pass. We do not have a definite time on the conference yet. We will give that to you as soon as we do, but it will be after the TV pass which is scheduled for 8:27 Central Standard Time. We should be acquiring at Texas in about 2 - 2 and one-half minutes. We'll come back up then. This is Mission Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control 46 hours 24 minutes. We are coming up on the Texas station now. To repeat the report on that private conversation, Rusty Schweickart felt some nausea a few hours ago, but he is feeling better now. He told doctors that he had an upset stomach and that he had vomited. He emphasized that his nausea had cleared and that he was feeling all right now. The flight crew and the flight controllers have agreed to continue with the flight as planned. We're coming up now on Texas. We will stand by.
TEXAS (REV 30)
046:24:42 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. Excuse me - Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston. How do you read through Texas? [Long pause]
046:25:00 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston through Texas. How do you read? [Long pause]
046:25:30 Roosa: Okay, Spider. This is Houston. Do I have you? [Long pause]
046:25:56 Roosa: Spider, this Houston. Do you read? [Long pause]
046:26:25 McDivitt (SPIDER): We should have had acquisition by now, shouldn't we?
046:26:29 Roosa: Hello, Spider. This is Houston. Do you read me? [Pause]
046:26:37 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. If you read, you can go ahead and put in your TV circuit breaker. We are going to be handing over to Mila in about 20 seconds. [Long pause]
Apparently we are having trouble with voice comm. We will continue to stand by.
046:26:49 Roosa: And, Spider, if you read, we'd like high bit rate. [Long pause]
MILA (REV 30)
046:27:20 Roosa: Hello, Spider. This is Houghton. How do you read?
046:27:24 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger, Houston. This is Spider. Loud and clear.
046:27:26 Roosa: Roger. You are loud and clear here. Now we have you in Mila AOS. You can start your TV pass. [Long pause]
We are still standing by for a picture here at the Control Center.
046:28:18 Roosa: Beautiful, Spider. We've got a picture now.
046:28:26 Roosa: And, Spider, this is Houston. If you read me, could you give us high bit rate? [Long pause]
046:28:49 Roosa: And you - And the picture is coming through good, Spider. We are copying it. We've got a good view of Rusty and the PLSS. [Long pause]
046:29:10 Roosa: Okay. Rusty, if you read me, how about raising your left arm there? Very good. We can see you; coming in real good. [Long pause]
046:29:39 Roosa: Well, we just went through a little snow storm there, Spider, but it looks like it might come back in. [Pause]
046:29:48 Roosa: Okay, the blizzard is gone, and you are back real sharp now. We've got good detail. [Pause]
046:30:00 Roosa: And, Spider, like I say, we are getting a good picture; we're getting no voice at all. [Pause]
046:30:12 Roosa: And I can see you talking there, Jim. Too bad I can't read your lips. [Long pause]
046:30:35 Roosa: Okay. Why don't you just go VHF if you can, Spider?
046:30:41 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. How do you read me right now?
046:30:42 Roosa: We're reading you loud and clear, Spider.
046:30:45 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. I guess we're just not getting out, like a VOX or something. Gumdrop is reading me all right, but you aren't.
046:30:52 Roosa: Okay. I'm not reading Gumdrop at all, and I am reading you loud and clear now. And the TV picture has been real good.
046:30:59 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. We are going to have the LMP talking into the PLSS comm.
046:31:04 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. How do you read now, Houston?
046:31:07 Roosa: PLSS? You are coming through loud and clear, Rusty. It's real good.
046:31:12 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. We have to go to PTC on the hand controller to do it. Evidently, ICS won't do it.
046:31:20 Roosa: Roger. Copy. It's coming through real good now. We've got just a little under 3 minutes in the pass. [Long pause]
046:31:37 Roosa: And, Rusty, if you ... [Pause]
046:31:46 McDivitt (SPIDER): Houston, this is Spider. Say again.
046:31:50 Roosa: Roger. If it's real convenient, we would like to have position 5 on the PLSS. But don't sweat it if you can't give us that. [Pause]
046:32:00 McDivitt (SPIDER): [Garble]. [Pause]
046:32:09 Roosa: Okay. We had a loud squeal in there. I've got you back again now. The request was - If it's real convenient, we would like to have position 5 on the PLSS. [Long pause]
046:32:49 Roosa: Okay. Jim, could we have a couple of words on - of wisdom to go along with the TV show? [Long pause]
046:33:16 Roosa: Okay. We are not receiving you. Rusty, how about you trying it again? May be we can pick you up. [Long pause]
046:34:03 Roosa: Okay, Spider. This is Houston. That's the end of the Milla pass. If you read me, you can go back to COMM basic at your convenience and press ahead with the Flight Plan. [Pause]
This is Apollo Control. We are not getting any ...
046:34:21 McDivitt (SPIDER): We're reconfiguring the PLSS right now and its COMM, and we're going to end the COMM checks here. And we will get them some other time.
046:34:27 Roosa: Roger. Understand. And that transmission came through loud and clear, and we will be standing by. [Long pause]
This is Apollo Control. Very bad voice communications during this pass. We did get some voice when the crew went to the push-to-talk button on the hand controller. That was the PTC you heard reference to. We were trying communications VOX, voice operated circuit prior to that, without luck. We got a little bit of voice on the push to talk, and then we lost comm again. The total length of that TV pass was 6 minutes 45 seconds. Apollo 9 is still in contact through Antigua. We will continue to stay up.
BERMUDA (REV 30)
046:35:25 McDivitt (SPIDER): Houston, Spider.
046:35:28 Roosa: Go ahead, Spider. Houston reading you loud and and clear.
046:35:31 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger, Houston. We're reconfiguring to basic COMM, and we're going to mush on and prepare for all the systems here.
046:35:38 Roosa: Roger. We will be standing by.
046:35:40 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. [Long pause]
046:35:52 McDivitt (SPIDER): And, Gumdrop, did you read that?
046:35:55 Scott (GUMDROP): Negative. I'm not copying Houston at all.
046:35:58 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. We're configuring, and we are going to press on with the systems.
046:36:02 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. Understand.
046:36:07 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, this is Houston. I've got you now.
046:36:10 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Houston, Gumdrop. You are five-by.
046:36:12 Roosa: Very good.
Comm break.
046:38:07 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston.
046:38:09 Scott (GUMDROP): Houston, Gumdrop.
046:38:11 Roosa: Roger. We would like to terminate the charge on battery A.
046:38:15 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Understand. Battery A, terminate charge. [Long pause]
046:38:48 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, Houston. We put in 13 AMP-hours. You are right back up to 40.
046:38:54 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Thank you. Very nice.
Long comm break.
MADRID (REV 30)
046:47:16 Roosa: Okay. Gumdrop and Spider. We're going to lose you in about a minute and a half here, and we'll see you over Carnarvon at 16. [Long pause]
046:47:54 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. If you read, give us low bit rate.
046:48:00 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Low bit rate.
046:48:03 Roosa: Okay. We'll see you at 16 over Carnarvon.
046:48:07 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 46 hours, 49 minute and we've had loss of signal at Madrid. Got some heart rates here on the crew - the two astronauts in the LM, Jim McDivitt's heart rate has been running around 100, Rusty Schweickart around the mid 80's - 85, 86 - Dave Scott in the Command Module is showing mid 70's - low to mid 70's. The next station to acquire will be Carnarvon at 47 hours, 15 minutes; stand by, we'll get a time now here I think on this news conference. We are estimating the news conference for 9 AM CST, in about 10 minutes. 9 AM for the news conference. This is Mission Control Houston.
CARNARVON (REV 30)
047:14:18 McDivitt (SPIDER): Ready. [Pause]
047:14:24 Scott (GUMDROP): 64 00308. [Pause]
047:14:32 McDivitt (SPIDER): All right. That was a little fast, but 35128 06864 00308.
047:14:41 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. You got it.
047:14:42 McDivitt (SPIDER): Thank you.
047:14:46 McDivitt (SPIDER): Dave, are your rates slow?
047:14:50 Scott (GUMDROP): Holy Christmas! What a bunch of gyros I've got over here! [Pause]
047:15:00 Roosa: And, Spider, this is Houston. We'd like to have high bit rate.
047:15:05 McDivitt (SPIDER): Houston, this is Spider. Go again.
047:15:08 Roosa: Roger. We'd like to have high bit rate.
047:15:11 McDivitt (SPIDER): High bit rate. Roger. [Pause]
047:15:25 McDivitt (SPIDER): Gumdrop, Spider. Every one of my gyros is indicating about 3/10 of a degree per second.
047:15:32 Scott (GUMDROP): Is that right? My roll is 0, pitch 0, yaw 0.
047:15:36 Schweickart (SPIDER): Great!
Comm break.
047:17:11 Roosa: And Gumdrop, I haven't heard from you on this one. And, Spider, I've got a couple of items to pass to you when you have a chance. [Pause]
047:17:22 McDivitt (SPIDER): Spider here. Go ahead.
047:17:24 Roosa: Roger. I've got a couple of addresses that's get to be changed as a result of the 3-day slip in the launch date, and when you are ready to copy, I'll give them to you. [Pause]
047:17:39 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Before you give us those, be advised that we have got a cockpit error here and we loaded - in starting up the PGNCS, we loaded location 30 000 with 2176 and we would like to know what we should put back into 30 000. [Pause]
047:18:00 Roosa: Roger. Stand by. In work.
047:18:04 McDivitt (SPIDER): If you want a reference on that, it's system 36, step 1.
047:18:11 Roosa: Roger. Copy.
047:18:14 Scott (GUMDROP): And the Gumdrop's with you, Houston.
047:18:17 Roosa: Roger, Gumdrop. [Long pause]
047:18:53 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, this is Houston. At your convenience, you might drag, out your block data pad. I have block data 6 to give you as we get along here. I have the PAD now.
047:19:06 Scott (GUMDROP): [Garble].
047:19:10 McDivitt (SPIDER): And, Gumdrop, this is Spider. So you can get out of your narrow deadband hold there, we will take an 0620 on your Mark.
047:19:19 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Roger. Okay. Stand by.
047:19:26 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Roger. Spider, Gumdrop. 3, 2, 1.
047:19:30 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. MARK.
047:19:35 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Ready to copy your angles, and you can go to DRIFT.
047:19:38 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Thank you. 35168 06888 00282. [Pause]
047:19:56 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Houston and Gumdrop, readback here from the Spider: 35168 0688 00282. [Pause]
047:20:10 Roosa: Roger, Spider. I have that. I'm reading back Gumdrop's as plus 35168 06888 00282; I'm reading yours as 31148 24879 35590. [Pause]
047:20:35 McDivitt (SPIDER): That's a verify, and the docking ring angle was plus 2.10 degrees.
047:20:41 Roosa: Roger. Plus 2.1.
047:20:46 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. And Spider ready to copy your updates.
047:20:52 Roosa: Okay. These addresses, if you are - if this unit W were the North Pole's - and your first address is 1714. What we want to load in there is 11143. The next address is 1716. We would like to load 30341. Now there were a couple of updates needed in the TFM, but you will pick those up as you go through that step. These are the only two that we would like to have you load.
047:21:31 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Be advised we already loaded TFM. Do you want us to read that down to you?
047:21:38 Roosa: Yes. Let's have it to verify.
047:21:42 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Ready to copy?
047:21:43 Roosa: Go ahead.
047:21:45 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Four balls 7 35016 31153.
047:21:52 Roosa: Roger. That's verified.
047:21:55 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. And we will be using these right now.
047:21:57 Roosa: Okay. Very good. [Long pause]
047:22:20 Scott (GUMDROP): Houston, Gumdrop. I'm all ready for the block update.
047:22:24 Roosa: Roger. Stand by just one if you can, Gumdrop,
047:22:29 Scott (GUMDROP): All righty. [Pause]
047:22:40 Roosa: Spider, Houston.
047:22:43 McDivitt (SPIDER): Go.
047:22:44 Roosa: Roger. We would like to know if you got an operator error when you hit ENTER on that 30 000 address.
047:22:51 McDivitt (SPIDER): That's a negative.
047:22:54 Roosa: Roger. Copy. No operator error.
047:22:57 McDivitt (SPIDER): Not that I noticed, anyway.
047:22:59 Roosa: Okay.
047:23:04 McDivitt (SPIDER): Let me put it this way. If there was an operator error, it disappeared by itself when I loaded the date, because I did not key a RESET.
047:23:13 Roosa: Roger. Copy. [Long pause]
047:23:34 McDivitt (SPIDER): Gumdrop, Spider. We would like to insure that the rates are less than 1/10 of a degree per second, and you won't be firing any jets for the next minute or so.
047:23:43 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. You are all set.
047:23:44 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Thank you. [Long pause]
047:24:40 Roosa: Okay. Gumdrop, this is Houston. I would like to get started on this block data.
047:24:45 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Go.
047:24:47 Roosa: Roger. 033 1 Alfa, plus 297, minus 0621 051 04 32 3870, and I would like to have both vehicles insure S-band volume up. 034 4 Alfa, plus 325, minus 1579 053 58 09 3858; 035 4 Alfa, plus 337, minus 1579 055 29 08 3857; 036 3 Alfa, plus 292, plus 1450 056 53 16 4635. Like to verify you are with me, Gumdrop. We didn't lose you over in the handover? [Pause]
HONEYSUCKLE (REV 30)
047:26:30 Scott (GUMDROP): I'm with you. I dropped about four bits, there, but go ahead.
047:26:34 Roosa: Okay. 037 4 Alfa, plus 244, plus 1619 058 39 31 4574; 038 3 Baker, plus 320, plus 1500 060 02 28 4618, and for your SPS trim angles, through your first three - through 35 dash 4 Alfa: your pitch is minus 0.88, yaw is minus 0.60. Through the rest of them: your pitch is minus 0.93, yaw is minus 1.21. End of update.
047:27:52 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Okay. I dropped one bit on the seconds on 34 4 Alfa. And the next area, I dropped the first three lines, and the rest of it I've got. So how about giving me those that I dropped?
047:28:08 Roosa: Okay. The second line in 34 4 Alfa is plus 325, the first three lines in the next one, 035 4 Alfa, plus 337, minus 1579; and I'd like for you to hold the readback for a little bit. And Spider, I have your LM torquing angles. [Pause]
047:28:35 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Stand by just one.
047:28:37 Roosa: Roger.
047:28:38 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. This is Gumdrop. Give me the seconds on the time of 34 4 Alfa.
047:28:43 Roosa: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you said the second line. Okay. The second: 09; the time: 053:58:09. [Pause]
047:28:54 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. 09. And I'll read it back whenever you're ready.
047:28:57 Roosa: Okay.
047:29:01 Schweickart (SPIDER): Houston. This is Spider. Reader to copy the angles.
047:29:04 Roosa: Okay. Reading the torquing angles: plus 00 910, minus 00 150, plus 01 210. [Pause]
047:29:24 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Reading back: plus 00 910, minus 00 150, plus 01 210.
047:29:34 Roosa: That's affirmative. We've got you.
047:29:37 Schweickart (SPIDER): Thank you. [Pause]
This is Apollo Control at 47 hour 29 minutes into the mission. Apollo 9 over the Honeysuckle Creek station in its 30th revolution. This pass started at Carnarvon about 14 minutes ago. During the pass, the crew is checking out the primary guidance and navigation system, the abort guidance system, the computers aboard, and they are aligning their inertial measurement unit in the LM. We will start the tape at Carnarvon now.
047:29:46 Roosa: Spider, Houston.
047:29:49 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Go ahead.
047:29:50 Roosa: Roger. And on this 30 000 bit, evidently the computer dropped a 3 and loaded addresses all zeros, and there is no action required on your part.
047:30:03 Schweickart (SPIDER): That's fortunate. Thank you.
047:30:05 Roosa: Roger. [Long pause]
047:30:51 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, on the last two dumps of the DSE we have received no LM data. Would like to have you check your cockpit configurations to receive the LM data, and also for Spider to send it.
047:31:10 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Gumdrop's configured. [Long pause]
047:31:26 Schweickart (SPIDER): Gumdrop, Spider. What was that last call? We've got a lot of noise on the S-band.
047:31:31 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. On the last two passes on the DSE they have not received any LM data on the dump. [Pause]
047:31:42 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. We're configured for data here.
047:31:47 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. [Garble]. [Long pause]
047:32:12 Scott (GUMDROP): Houston, Gumdrop. [Pause]
047:32:18 Roosa: Go, Gumdrop.
047:32:20 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger I don't see the tape recorder running at at this time.
047:32:29 Roosa: Stand by, Gumdrop.
047:32:37 Roosa: Gumdrop, this is Houston. Could you verify your tape recorder switch is in the RECORD position?
047:32:43 Scott (GUMDROP): That's verified.
047:32:45 Roosa: Okay. Thank you. [Long pause]
047:33:03 Schweickart (SPIDER): Houston, this is Spider.
047:33:05 Roosa: Go, Spider.
047:33:08 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. Go ahead.
047:33:11 Schweickart (SPIDER): Gumdrop, is he reading us?
047:33:13 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. He's reading you. Go ahead.
047:33:15 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. I'll have to transmit in the blind. Be advised we're beginning the RCS pressurization on system 42, and on the second step we have an interesting result there. When I recycled system A, ascent feed 2 to CLOSE, both barber poles jumped to J, ascent feed 1 went back to barber pole immediately, and ascent feed 2 waited for about 20 seconds and then went back to barber pole; and that's happened twice in a row.
047:33:54 Roosa: Roger. Copy. Stand by on that one.
047:34:00 Scott (GUMDROP): He got you, Spider.
047:34:04 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. If you have any recommendation - I'm going to try in system B. If he has any recommendations let me know.
047:34:09 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay.
047:34:10 Roosa: All right. We sure will; we're massaging that now, Spider.
047:34:15 Scott (GUMDROP): Spider, Gumdrop. They are working it over. [Long pause]
047:34:30 Roosa: Spider, Houston. [Pause]
047:34:36 Scott (GUMDROP): Houston, Gumdrop. I don't believe he's reading. I can relay for you.
047:34:38 Roosa: Okay. We're about to lose you here at Honeysuckle, we'll see you over Mercury about 37, in about 3 minutes, and we'll clean it up there.
047:34:47 Scott (GUMDROP): Very well; Mercury at 37.
047:34:55 Roosa: Gumdrop, if you still read me, why don't you start the readback of that block data here until we go over the hill.
047:35:02 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Let's give it a go.
047:35:05 Scott (GUMDROP): 033 1 Alfa - Oh, I'm losing you now, Houston. [Long pause]
047:35:29 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Roger. And you might advise him that system A [garble] appear to be normal now. It looks like we might have had a sticky barber pole on ascent feed 2.
047:35:40 Roosa: We copied that, Spider. We concur.
047:35:46 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay.
Comm break.
MERCURY (REV 30)
047:37:39 Roosa: Okay, Spider and Gumdrop. We should have you through Mercury.
047:37:45 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger, Houston. Here's the Gumdrop.
047:37:48 McDivitt (SPIDER): You have Spider here, Houston.
047:37:50 Roosa: Roger. We're showing your RCS pressurized, and we're also requesting you check the address 1457 and verify that it is 62045, and the reason why I'm calling you on this is, back on systems 41 when you loaded 1456, we believe it also change 1457. [Pause]
047:38:23 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Lets - The address is 1457. What is the number supposed to be now?
047:38:28 Roosa: Should be 62045.
047:38:35 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. 1457 should be 62045.
047:38:38 Roosa: That's affirmative.
047:38:42 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Houston, You might check 1453 and 1455, also. My understanding was that those are double precisions for the PIPA bias, and that's why we loaded zeros in all three of these.
047:39:00 Roosa: Roger. Copy, Spider, in work.
047:39:04 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. [Long pause]
047:39:45 McDivitt (SPIDER): Houston, this is Spider.
047:39:47 Roosa: Go, Spider.
047:39:49 McDivitt (SPIDER): 1457 is all balls.
047:39:52 Roosa: Okay. We'd like to have you load 62045.
047:39:57 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Then probably 3 and 5 will also be wrong. I'll load this one up right now.
047:40:03 Roosa: Okay. We'll get back with you on that. We're going to have you over the Mercury here for about 7-1/2 minutes left, and I'd like to pass you your gimbal angles so we'll be all rocking on ready for your gimbal drive check when we hit Guaymas.
047:40:23 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Stand by just one. [Pause]
047:40:33 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Go ahead.
047:40:35 Roosa: Roger. Your GDA angles: R1, plus 00588; and R2, plus 00679. [Pause]
047:40:53 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Plus 00588, plus 00679.
047:40:58 Roosa: That's affirmative; and stand by. I'll have you what you need in address 1453 and 55.
047:41:07 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Do you have LM and CSM weights, by the way?
047:41:13 Roosa: Stand by one, Spider. [Long pause]
047:41:49 Roosa: Spider, Houston.
047:41:51 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Go.
047:41:52 Roosa: All right. Your LM weight: 32 418, and that's also for Gumdrop if he wants it. CSM 30 127.
047:42:07 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. 32 418 and 30 127.
047:42:14 Roosa: That's affirmative, Spider.
047:42:17 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. How much time do we have in this pass?
047:42:24 Roosa: Roger, Spider. We've still got about 5 minutes left in this pass.
047:42:29 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. I'd like - Some of the systems guys might have noticed a little anomaly there at the end of the RCS pressurization on step 6.
047:42:41 Roosa: Okay.
047:42:44 McDivitt (SPIDER): Make it step 5. I beg your pardon. I inadvertently placed system A ascent feed 2 momentarily to OPEN instead of CLOSE, thereby opening the interconnect. I closed it immediately, and I see no change in the system pressures; however it's probably an anomaly and in the data there you might note, and I'd like to know if there is any further action required.
047:43:16 Roosa: Roger, Spider. Houston copies. And we anticipate no problems. And I have your loads for 1453 and 55. [Pause]
047:43:30 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Ready to copy.
047:43:33 Roosa: 1453: 60066. 1455: 60462. [Pause]
047:43:47 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Let me read all of those. 53, 55 and 57 equal 60066, 60462, 62045. [Pause]
047:44:01 Roosa: That is affirmative, Spider; Houston confirms.
047:44:06 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. We'll load them now.
047:44:08 Roosa: Okay. And, Gumdrop, let's go ahead with your readback, starting right from the first line. [Long pause]
047:44:35 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston. Standing by for your readback. [Pause]
047:44:48 Scott (GUMDROP): Houston, Gumdrop.
047:44:50 Roosa: Roger. I'm ready for your readback.
047:44:53 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. Sorry, I must have lost you there for a minute. Okay, here we go: 033 1 Alfa, plus 297, minus 0621 051 04 32 3870; 034 4 Alfa, plus 325, minus 1579 053 58 09 3858; 035 4 Alfa plus 337, minus 1579 055 29 08 3857; 036 3 Alfa, plus 292, plus 1450 056 53 16 4638; 037 4 Alfa, plus 244, minus 1619 058 39 31 4574; 038 3 Bravo, plus 320, plus 1500 060 02 28 4618. You with me that far? [Pause]
047:46:09 Roosa: I've got it all, and everything's good.
047:46:12 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. And the pitch trim and yaw trim for 33 1 Alfa through 35 4 Alfa: pitch is minus 0.88, yaw minus 0.60. For 36 3 Alfa through 38 3 Bravo: pitch minus 0.93, yaw minus 1.21.
047:46:34 Roosa: Roger. Good show, Gumdrop. And we're gonna lose both of you in about 1 minute. We'll see you over Guaymas at about 57, and we'll be rocking on ready for you, Spider.
047:46:46 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. What time will we be at Guaymas?
047:46:48 Roosa: Roger. it'll be Guaymas at 57, and we'd like to have low bit rate at this time.
047:46:54 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 47 hours, 52 minutes and we will acquire at the Redstone, a low elevation pass there in about a minute. During this pass across Australia and over the Mercury Ship in the South Pacific, the crew in the LM has been checking out the computer, aligning the platform, pressurizing the RCS system.
REDSTONE (REV 30)
047:53:20 Roosa: Hello, Spider and Gumdrop. This is Houston through the Redstone.
047:53:25 Scott (GUMDROP): Loud and clear, Houston. Gumdrop.
047:53:27 Roosa: Roger. And to get a leg up on this Guaymas pass, I have a NAV check I'd like to give to you now, and we'll be uplinking state vectors to both vehicles over Guaymas, sometime in the States pass. [Long pause]
047:54:08 Roosa: Okay, Spider. Are you ready, Gumdrop? I'll be ready to send you a NAV check when you're ready to copy. [Pause]
047:54:22 Scott (GUMDROP): Ready for NAV check. [Long pause]
047:54:39 Scott (GUMDROP): Gumdrop's ready.
047:54:41 Roosa: Roger, Gumdrop. I'll give it to you. Are you ready, Spider?
047:54:46 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Spider ready.
047:54:47 Roosa: All right. Reading the NAV check: 049 11 3340, minus 2216, plus 16516 23039. End of NAV check. [Pause]
047:55:17 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Say the time again, please.
047:55:19 Roosa: Roger. Reading the time: 049 11 3340. [Pause]
047:55:33 McDivitt (SPIDER): Say, Gumdrop. I got 3340, is that right, Gumdrop?
047:55:39 Roosa: That's affirmative, Spider; this is Houston.
047:55:42 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. I'll read it back to you: 049 11 3340, minus 2216, plus 16516 2309. [Pause]
047:55:54 Roosa: Your readback is correct, Spider; and Gumdrop, did you verify? [Pause]
047:56:02 Scott (GUMDROP): Gumdrop verifies.
047:56:04 Roosa: Roger. And while I've got you in a writing mood - I've got about a minute and a half; I'd like to give you the dock DPS PAD.
047:56:13 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. You should be advised that you are not coming through too good here to Spider; I'm not sure why, but you are breaking up pretty badly.
047:56:22 Roosa: Roger. We're going to lose you in about a minute, and then we'll just catch you over Guaymas.
047:56:30 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Gumdrop copied you. You'll get us over Guaymas. You get that, Spider?
047:56:31 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. I heard you. Understand he's going to get us over Guaymas.
047:56:41 Scott (GUMDROP): That's affirm. [Long pause]
047:56:55 Roosa: And, Gumdrop and Spider, if you read, we are GO for a 48 dash 1.
047:57:02 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Understand. GO for a 48 dash 1. [Pause]
047:57:06 Roosa: That is affirmative. [Pause]
047:57:10 Scott (GUMDROP): Did you get that, Spider?
047:57:12 Schweickart (SPIDER): Got it.
047:57:14 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay.
047:57:16 Schweickart (SPIDER): We'll stay docked with you.
047:57:19 Scott (GUMDROP): Oh, very well. [Pause]
GUAYMAS (REV 30)
047:57:32 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, we've got you now at Guaymas. We'd like to have P00 in ACCEPT for your uplink.
047:57:40 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Gumdrop. You've got P00 and ACCEPT.
047:57:42 Roosa: Roger, Copy. [Long pause]
047:57:53 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, you'll be receiving a vector in both slots.
047:57:57 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Understand. [Long pause]
047:58:48 Roosa: Spider, could you give us high bit rate, please?
047:58:55 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. You got high bit rate?
047:59:00 Roosa: Roger. Copy. [Long pause]
Apollo Control. That is Rusty Schweickart doing most of the communicating from the Lunar Module.
047:59:30 Schweickart (SPIDER): And, Houston, this is Spider.
047:59:34 Roosa: Go ahead, Spider.
047:59:36 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. We are ready to go on the gimbal drive any time.
047:59:38 Roosa: Roger. We are standing by to support you. You can let her rip.
047:59:41 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Here we go - 3, 2, 1.
047:59:45 Schweickart (SPIDER): MARK. [Pause]
047:59:55 Schweickart (SPIDER): And are you ready?
047:59:58 Roosa: You faded out, Spider. Say again.
048:00:03 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. The gimbal is driving.
048:00:11 Scott (GUMDROP): Houston, Gumdrop. Spider says the gimbal is driving.
048:00:13 Roosa: Roger. Copy. And, Gumdrop, the computer is yours.
048:00:17 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Understand you copy, and I got the computer.
048:00:26 Schweickart (SPIDER): Houston, do you read Gumdrop or Spider?
048:00:29 Roosa: Reading you loud and clear, Spider.
048:00:31 Schweickart (SPIDER): Here we have the GGA PCGA light on at this time, and are you ready to support the throttle test?
048:00:38 Roosa: Spider, you are GO for the throttle test. [Pause]
048:00:42 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. LMP throttle is idle. We are now at the soft-stop.
048:00:51 Roosa: Roger. Copy.
048:00:52 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. Full throttle point and back to IDLE. [Pause]
048:01:05 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay, Houston. Commander's throttle is in IDLE. Now soft-stop - maximum - back down to the soft- stop and IDLE. [Pause]
048:01:18 Roosa: Roger, Spider. [Long pause]
048:01:51 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. Houston, this is Spider. We are standing by for your verification on the GDA angle.
048:01:58 Roosa: Roger. I believe they look good. Stand by one, Spider. [Pause]
048:02:10 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. You are GO on the gimbal drive angles.
048:02:14 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Stand by for hot fire.
048:02:17 Roosa: Roger. We are standing by.
048:02:22 Roosa: We are standing by to support your hot fire, Spider. We are ready.
048:02:25 Schweickart (SPIDER): Houston, we are ready to go.
048:02:28 Roosa: Let her rip, Spider.
048:02:29 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. A couple more switches. [Long pause]
048:03:16 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay, Houston. Spider here. We will start the proportionalized check, both fire.
048:03:22 Roosa: Roger. Understand. And we are ready to go.
048:03:25 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. [Long pause]
048:03:50 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. That's complete.
048:03:54 Roosa: Roger. [Pause]
048:04:04 McDivitt (SPIDER): Gumdrop, We are about to fire our jets here so you want to be in FREE.
048:04:08 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. FREE standing by.
048:04:10 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger.
048:04:12 Scott (GUMDROP): How are you with respect to gimbal lock?
048:04:15 McDivitt (SPIDER): Oh, about 15 - 20 degrees.
048:04:18 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. Keep an eyeball on it.
048:04:19 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. I will be right with you. [Pause]
048:04:31 Schweickart (SPIDER): You told us to take the hot fare now.
048:04:32 Roosa: We're ready to go. PRESS.
048:04:35 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. [Long pause]
048:04:55 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay, Houston. It's complete.
048:04:58 Roosa: Roger. Copy.
048:05:01 Scott (GUMDROP): Good job; rate is almost normal.
048:05:03 Schweickart (SPIDER): I still have some more to go. [Long pause]
048:05:24 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay, Houston. Here comes a little hot fire on a TTCA.
048:05:28 Roosa: Roger. Spider, this is Houston. Would you go through it slower, please? You are going to have to go slower.
048:05:35 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. We'll go TTCA.
048:05:40 Roosa: Roger.
048:05:43 Schweickart (SPIDER): We are not going to hold them [garble] long. We'll just wait longer between pulses.
048:05:47 Roosa: Roger. That will really help us out, Spider.
048:05:50 Schweickart (SPIDER): You don't want them held down longer. You just want them longer between pulses. Is that right?
048:05:54 Roosa: That is affirmative, Spider.
048:05:56 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. We'll try it again.
048:06:02 Schweickart (SPIDER): That was up.
048:06:07 Schweickart (SPIDER): Down. [Pause]
048:06:13 Schweickart (SPIDER): Right. [Pause]
048:06:18 Schweickart (SPIDER): Left. [Pause]
048:06:28 Schweickart (SPIDER): Aft.
048:06:30 Schweickart (SPIDER): How was that, Houston?
048:06:35 Roosa: That looked real good Spider. [Pause]
048:06:48 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. Here comes the PNGS OTGA check.
048:06:52 Roosa: Roger, Spider. [Pause]
048:07:01 Schweickart (SPIDER): Up. [Pause]
048:07:07 Schweickart (SPIDER): Down. [Pause]
048:07:14 Schweickart (SPIDER): Right. [Pause]
048:07:20 Schweickart (SPIDER): Left. [Pause]
048:07:25 Schweickart (SPIDER): Forward. [Pause]
048:07:29 Schweickart (SPIDER): Aft.
048:07:30 Schweickart (SPIDER): How was that?
048:07:32 Roosa: That looked real good, Spider. Everything looks good.
048:07:34 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay, Dave. That's all of the hot fire.
048:07:40 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. Good job. You moved us away from it. [Pause]
048:07:57 Schweickart (SPIDER): And, Houston, you got to give us the update at this time?
048:08:02 Roosa: Roger. I have the PAD ready to go, and can you take an uplink now?
048:08:09 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. The computer is yours; and ready to copy the docked DPS. This is Spider.
048:08:14 Roosa: Roger, Spider. Stand by one.
048:08:16 Scott (GUMDROP): Gumdrop is ready.
048:08:18 Roosa: Okay. Copied you, Gumdrop. And Spider, the uplink is on its way. I'm reading docked DPS: 049 41 3340, minus 00603, minus 17430, minus 00007 17440 all zips all zips, minus 00587, minus 17430, minus 00139. End of update. [Pause]
048:09:24 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger, Houston. Spider reading back: 049 41 3340, minus 00603, minus 17430, minus 00007 17440 all zips all zips, minus 00587, minus 17430, minus 00139. [Pause]
048:09:57 Roosa: Roger. Very good. The readback was correct.
VANGUARD (REV 31)
048:10:02 Scott (GUMDROP): Gumdrop copied. [Long pause]
048:10:21 Roosa: And, Spider and Gumdrop, it looks like we are making good work on this pass. We've still got about 15 minutes here. [Pause]
048:10:36 Schweickart (SPIDER): Houston, Spider here. You broke up.
Comm break.
048:11:43 Schweickart (SPIDER): Houston, this is Spider.
048:11:45 Roosa: Go, Spider.
048:11:47 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. We are going to start the landing radar self-test here if you are ready. [Pause]
048:11:58 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. The computer is yours. We are standing by for the landing radar selftest. Press ahead.
048:12:05 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. The DFI is coming on now.
048:12:07 Roosa: Roger.
Long comm break.
048:16:37 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston.
048:16:40 Scott (GUMDROP): Houston, Gumdrop.
048:16:42 Roosa: Roger. We would like to have you bring quad C back on the line when you disable Baker 3.
048:16:50 Scott (GUMDROP): Wilco. [Pause]
048:16:57 Schweickart (SPIDER): Gumdrop and Houston, be advised that Spider did not unstow the radar antenna today. [Pause]
048:17:09 Roosa: Roger. We understood that. Will you be unstowing it for the rendezvous radar self-test? [Pause]
048:17:19 Schweickart (SPIDER): I don't believe so. I think we can run the selftest without unstowing it. Since we're not going to do the EVA tomorrow, there is no sense in unstowing it. We've already skipped the star check in the daylight, so we have, no reason to get it out of the way.
048:17:37 Roosa: Roger. Copy.
048:17:41 Schweickart (SPIDER): If you have any other comment, please let us know.
048:17:44 Roosa: All right. Sure will.
048:17:47 Scott (GUMDROP): And Gumdrop copied.
048:17:53 Schweickart (SPIDER): And, Houston, here comes the landing radar spurious noise test.
048:17:58 Roosa: Roger. Copy, Spider. [Long pause]
048:18:11 Schweickart (SPIDER): Houston, do you read? Spider.
048:18:13 Roosa: Go, Spider.
048:18:15 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. How long do you want us to run this spurious noise test here?
048:18:18 Roosa: Stand by one.
048:18:23 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Step 16, system 49. We are ready to stop it any time you are ready.
048:18:29 Roosa: Roger. Understand. We are taking a look at it, Spider. And, Spider, you can terminate the test now. And, Gumdrop, we would like to have quad C on whether you disable Backer 3 or not.
048:18:43 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Charlie coming up. [Long pause]
CANARY (REV 31)
048:19:02 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, we are showing your quad balance as excellent. It's looking real great, Gumdrop.
048:19:11 Schweickart (SPIDER): Houston, Spider.
048:19:13 Roosa: Go ahead, Spider. This is Houston.
048:19:15 Schweickart (SPIDER): Your R and D telemetry CALIBRATE coming on now.
048:19:18 Roosa: Roger. Copy. [Long pause]
048:19:37 Roosa: And, Gumdrop and Spider, this is Houston. We have finished up that famous pass with 6 minutes to spare. [Pause]
048:19:48 McDivitt (SPIDER): Smokey, you are so smooth I just can't believe it. You are just directing us magnificently.
048:19:54 Roosa: I'm getting mad with power down here, Spider. [Long pause]
048:20:17 Schweickart (SPIDER): Say, Gumdrop, this is Spider.
048:20:19 Scott (GUMDROP): Go ahead.
048:20:20 Schweickart (SPIDER): You are still going to have to disable B3 for a while so we don't get any corona on our radar.
048:20:25 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. Say when.
048:20:26 Schweickart (SPIDER): How about right now.
048:20:27 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. It's disabled. [Pause]
048:20:37 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston.
048:20:39 Scott (GUMDROP): Houston, Gumdrop. Go ahead.
048:20:41 Roosa: Roger. We're still recommending two-jet roll authority - we're recommending Able Charlie roll off.
048:20:48 Scott (GUMDROP): Houston, Gumdrop. Say again.
048:20:50 Roosa: Roger. We are recommending that two-jet roll authority, roll AC - we'd like to leave it off.
048:20:58 Scott (GUMDROP): Houston, Gumdrop. You get knocked down with static every time. Try it again.
048:21:02 Roosa: Okay. We would like to stay with two-jet roll authority - recommend in AC stay off.
048:21:11 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. Very well. AC coning back off.
Comm break.
048:24:00 Roosa: Say, Spider and Gumdrop. We are going to lose you here in about 1 minute. We'll see you over Tananarive at 37, and that was a good show on both vehicles there.
048:24:12 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okey-dokey.
048:24:13 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Gumdrop. [Long pause]
048:24:33 McDivitt (SPIDER): Houston, this is Gumdrop - Spider. Before you go - if you are still reading us - We are not reading any range and range rate on the DSKY for the radar.
048:24:41 Roosa: Roger. Understand. No range and range rates. And, Spider, we'd like to have low bit rate, please. [Pause]
048:24:53 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger.
048:24:58 Roosa: And we are looking at that problem on your range and range rate right now, Jim. We think the stowing of the radar might of affect that.
048:25:09 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay.
048:25:13 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. We get the range rate to read this time [garble] back again. It's really 497. [Pause]
048:25:25 Roosa: Roger. I believe I got that, 497.
048:25:31 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 48 hours, 26 minutes into the mission. Canaries has LOS. That's a very long, busy pass starting at the Redstone out in the Pacific, extending over the United States clear across the Atlantic Ocean, ending over Africa - extreme range of the Canaries station. The crew accomplished quite a number of tests during this pass. They checked the Reaction Control System - hot fired it in all the control modes - went very well. They've checked the computers, the Guidance System and the backup Guidance System. They've checked the landing radar and the rendezvous radar. Jim McDivitt reporting there at the last that he was reading no range and range rate on the rendezvous radar. The radar antenna is stowed - there's the ground is taking a look at the radar, but there is some belief that because the antenna is stowed - that good reading might not come up. In connection with that you may have heard Jim McDivitt mentioning - when he remarked that the radar antenna was stowed. He said: "If we do not go EVA tomorrow - " I'd like to clear that up. We have not eliminated EVA from the Flight Plan. The possibility exists, of course, but I repeat: We have not scrubbed EVA for tomorrow, at this time. Another matter of interest - wives of all 3 crewmen are in the viewing room at the control center at this time - Pat McDivitt, Lurton Scott and Clare Schweickart. They are accompanied by Astronaut Tom Stafford and by Astronaut Bill Anders and his wife. We passed up the maneuver PAD for the Docked Descent Propulsion Burn during this pass. Time for that burn is 49 hours, 41 minutes, 33.4 seconds. That's 11:41:34 am Central Standard Time. It will be performed over the MILA tracking station at the start of the 32nd revolution - will be an out of plane burn with a Delta V of 1,744 feet per second. A burn time of 6 minutes, 11 seconds. Since it is out of plane, there will be very little affect to the orbit. Apogee is expected to be lower by about 2 miles. Expect to be in an orbit of 272 by 109 nautical miles prior to the burn. We expect the result in orbit after the burn - 270 by 109 nautical miles. Next station to acquire will be Tananarive at 48 hours, 36 - 37 minutes. This is Mission Control in Houston.
This is Apollo Control 48 hours 37 minutes and we've just put in a call to Apollo 9 at Tananarive. We'll stand by.
TANANARIVE (REV 31)
048:36:52 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Comm break.
048:38:08 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston through Tananarive. Standing by. [Long pause]
048:38:35 Roosa: Tanarive M&O, this is Houston CAPCOMM. Do you read? [Pause]
048:38:48 Roosa: Tanarive M&O, Houston CAPCOMM. Voice check.
Comm break.
048:39:59 Communications Technician: CAPCOMM, Tananarive.
048:40:00 Roosa: Tananarive M&O, this is Houston CAPCOMM. Am I coming through to you? Am I going up? Communications Technician:
048:40:06 Communications Technician: The first transmission was very low down in the mud. You called back, asked for the M&O; I received it clear, and then we were switched over to Melbourne circuit. Communications Technician:
048:40:20 Roosa: Okay. Am I going up to the spacecraft at this time? Communications Technician:
048:40:27 Communications Technician: [Garble].
048:40:28 Roosa: All right. This is Houston CAP [garble].
048:40:29 Communications Technician: Affirmative.
048:40:30 Roosa: All right, Spider and Gumdrop. This is Houston through Tananarive. [Pause]
048:40:42 Roosa: Tananarive M&O, Houston, CAPCOMM. Am I receiving a downlink from the spacecraft? Communications Technician:
048:40:48 Communications Technician: [Garble] I'll copy.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 48 hours 42 minutes. We're not having any luck trying to establish communications through Tananarive. The station has been bad several other times during this mission. Stu Roosa will not try to make a call up any more for the rest of this pass. If communications are established and the crew calls us we will come back up. This is Mission Control Houston.
048:45:02 Roosa: Okay, Spider and Gumdrop. Houston in the blind. If you read me, we will see you over Carnarvon at 53.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 48 hours 52 minutes. Apollo 9 should be tagging up at Carnarvon momentarily, we will monitor the pass.
CARNARVON (REV 31)
048:53:17 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston through Carnarvon. And, Spider, we would like to have high bit rate. [Pause]
048:53:26 McDivitt (SPIDER): Got you, Houston. Going to high bit rate.
048:53:30 Scott (GUMDROP): Gumdrop is with you.
048:53:31 Roosa: Roger. And just maybe till we shoot our COMM, did either of you read me over Tananarive.
048:53:38 McDivitt (SPIDER): Spider. I read you.
048:53:39 Scott (GUMDROP): And Gumdrop did too.
048:53:43 Roosa: Very good. Thank you.
048:53:45 McDivitt (SPIDER): Say, Houston, Spider. I've got your stuff for you.
048:53:49 Roosa: Go ahead, I'm ready to copy.
048:53:51 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Number 1, our helium SUPERCRIT pressure is reading again at 750. [Pause]
048:54:02 Roosa: Roger. Copy, Spider. We're showing 735.
048:54:06 McDivitt (SPIDER): That's okay. My helium ambient pressure is down to 210. I think that's a little lower than it's supposed to be.
048:54:15 Roosa: Roger. We confirm that. We're shoving 208, and it's okay.
048:54:20 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Be advised we can not initialize the AGS from the PGNCS. We can not initialize the AGS from the PGNCS.
048:54:30 Roosa: Roger. Copy. You can not initialize AGS from the PGNCS.
048:54:38 McDivitt (SPIDER): Update part of it from the PGNCS to the AGS. The downlink part of PGNCS will not get into the AGS. When we put 10 000 up, it just stays there at 10 000.
048:54:50 Roosa: Roger. Understand that the AGS will not accept the PGNCS downlink.
048:54:56 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger.
048:55:02 McDivitt (SPIDER): Oh, and did you get our message on the rendezvous radar?
048:55:07 Roosa: Roger. I und - you were going - you were - just about to lose you - You said you had no range rate on the DSKY, and then you did something, and I didn't copy that.
048:55:18 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay, we got the range to come in to the DSKY one time and the range rate a couple of times, but it's not consistent at all.
048:55:28 Roosa: Roger. Copy. [Long pause]
048:55:40 McDivitt (SPIDER): Say, Houston, did you get our gimbal angles and that other stuff?
048:55:48 Roosa: That is a negative. We have not received anything from you over Tananarive.
048:55:55 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay, Gumdrop. You want to send then down those?
048:56:00 Schweickart (SPIDER): I'll get them.
048:56:01 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Never mind. I guess we have them all. Gumdrop, why don't you send them the torquing angles first?
048:56:04 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. Houston, Gumdrop. Are you ready to copy?
048:56:07 Roosa: Go ahead.
048:56:10 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. The P52 torquing angles: GET 48:44:00, plus 00213, plus 00042, minus 00147.
048:56:26 Roosa: Roger. Copy those, Gumdrop.
048:56:34 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger.
048:56:37 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay, Houston. And I've got IMU realignment angles for you.
048:56:41 Roosa: I'm standing by to copy.
048:56:45 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Command module angles: 02029 02856 33357. LM angles: 28202 20876 02659.
048:57:08 Roosa: Roger, Spider. I copy. For command module: 02029 02856 33357. For the LM: 28202 20876 02659. And we'll go to work on them.
048:57:31 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. And when you're ready, I've got some AGS calibration data.
048:57:35 Roosa: Roger. I'm ready to copy.
048:57:37 Roosa: I'm ready to copy your data, Spider. [Pause]
048:57:45 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Stand by. [Pause]
048:57:52 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. The bias coefficients before the CAL: minus 77777, plus all zips, minus all 7's. The gyro drift: we're plus 00027, plus 00047, plus 00006. Did you copy those?
048:58:20 Roosa: Roger. I copied those.
048:58:24 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. And following the CAL: plus all zips plus all zips, minus all 7's. And the gyro drift after the CAL: plus 00021, plus: 00036, minus 00020.
048:58:48 Roosa: Roger, Spider. I copy those. [Pause]
048:58:54 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay . And the only other thing I need right now is the procedure from one of the AGS guys on how to get 414 back to zero. As I recall, you can not simply set it to zero; you have to go through a little procedure, there. I wonder if you would get that for us.
048:59:12 Roosa: Roger, Spider. I copy. 414 back to zero, and that's in work. [Long pause]
048:59:26 Roosa: And, Gumdrop and Spider, I'd like to have both vehicles with S-band up. We'll be going over to Honeysuckle in a couple of minutes.
048:59:34 Scott (GUMDROP): Gumdrop.
048:59:37 McDivitt (SPIDER): Spider. [Long pause]
048:59:49 Roosa: Spider, Houston.
048:59:52 McDivitt (SPIDER): Go.
048:59:54 Roosa: Roger. We're suspecting a leak in the DPS helium manifold, and, stand by one. And we'd like to have you take a look at DPS malfunction procedure number 1.
049:00:15 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. [Long pause]
049:00:53 Roosa: Spider, Houston.
049:00:55 McDivitt (SPIDER): Go.
049:00:57 Roosa: Roger. We just noticed you doing a VERB 47 there, and we'd like to have you try the initialization again.
049:01:07 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Understand. You want us to do it again?
049:01:11 Roosa: Stand by one.
049:01:14 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Be advised we tried to VERB 47 two times, and it seems to come out of the PGNCS okay, but the AGS 414 never goes back to zero. [Pause]
049:01:37 Roosa: Roger. I copy that, Spider, and I have your torquing angles while we work on that.
049:01:45 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Just stand by just one.
049:01:46 Roosa: Roger.
049:01:50 McDivitt (SPIDER): Ready to copy.
049:01:52 Roosa: Roger. Reading your torquing angles: minus 00040, plus 00180, minus 00160. [Pause]
049:02:14 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Copy minus 00040, plus 00180, minus 00160. [Long pause]
049:02:25 Roosa: That's affirmative. We confirm those.
049:02:29 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Thank you.
049:02:31 McDivitt (SPIDER): Houston, do you want us to close the descent helium REG 1?
049:02:34 Schweickart (SPIDER): And if [garble] what do you want us to do on this procedure?
049:02:39 Roosa: Roger. We copy that, Spider. Stand by one. [Long pause]
HONEYSUCKLE (REV 31)
049:03:05 Roosa: Spider, Houston.
049:03:08 McDivitt (SPIDER): Go.
049:03:10 Roosa: Roger. We would like to have you try that initialization again while we've got some data here on you.
049:03:18 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Will do. [Pause]
049:03:27 Schweickart (SPIDER): Gumdrop, are you sort of angling toward the burn attitude here?
049:03:31 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. That's affirm.
049:03:37 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay.
049:03:39 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston.
049:03:41 McDivitt (SPIDER): Go ahead, Houston.
049:03:42 Schweickart (SPIDER): [Garble] Spider.
049:03:43 Roosa: Roger. We misinterpreted your question here. We would like to have you press ahead with MAL 1, and just press right ahead.
049:03:53 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. What ...
049:03:54 Roosa: Go ahead, Spider.
049:03:55 McDivitt (SPIDER): You, want 10 and 12?
049:03:56 Roosa: That is affirmative. Go ahead and press through blocks 10 and 12.
049:04:00 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. [Pause]
049:04:08 McDivitt (SPIDER): The downlink is in process with the AGS, Houston. [Pause]
049:04:18 Roosa: Spider, Houston. Say that again.
049:04:20 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. We threw in a VERB 47, and doggone if it didn't go in that time.
049:04:27 Roosa: Roger. We waved our magic wand over it through Honeysuckle, there, Spider.
049:04:33 McDivitt (SPIDER): You guys got what it takes with SIM SUP.
049:04:36 Roosa: That's affirmative.
Comm break.
049:07:00 Roosa: Spider, Houston. I have a little bit of info when you are ready to listen. No need to copy.
049:07:06 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay, good. I'm a good listener. Be advised that our regulator pressure doesn't seem to be dropping. It's holding at about 232; that's for the DPS.
049:07:19 Roosa: Roger. That is your regulator pressure, Spider?
049:07:23 McDivitt (SPIDER): That's right. We were reading off the fuel and oxidizer pressures. They are both reading 232, and have been since I closed the REG. Also, my ambient tank has been holding at about 210.
049:07:42 Roosa: Roger. Copy 210. [Pause]
049:07:49 Roosa: And, Spider, my little tidbit here is that during our hot-fire test, we do have a thrust chamber pressure switch failed CLOSED on thruster B4 UP. It failed on the first firing. It will have no effect to you at all with the exception that the caution and warning will not detect an OFF failure of that thruster. That is Baker 4 UP. [Pause]
049:08:23 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay, will it detect an UP - stuck ON thruster?
049:08:34 Roosa: Stand by. That is affirmative. [Long pause]
049:09:14 Roosa: Spider, Houston. This sensor is not used in the thruster ON logic, it's strictly thruster OFF, so the answer to your question is affirmative. Caution and warning will detect a thruster ON failure.
049:09:29 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. [Long pause]
049:09:41 McDivitt (SPIDER): And, Houston, do you want me to press on any further with this malfunction procedure, or do you want me to open up that REG again?
049:09:48 Roosa: Stand by, Spider. [Long pause]
049:10:04 Roosa: Spider, Houston. We would like to have you go back to normal configuration. Open regulator 1.
049:10:10 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. it's open on COMM TECH's three, and be advised that we're just about in a posture to perform the DPS burn at this time and get some last minute checks.
049:10:24 Roosa: Roger. Understand. I'm about to lose you at Honeysuckle. We can have you through the Huntsville with no loss. [Pause]
049:10:35 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger.
Comm break.
HUNTSVILLE (REV 31)
049:13:23 Scott (GUMDROP): Spider, Gumdrop.
049:13:26 McDivitt (SPIDER): Go ahead.
049:13:28 Scott (GUMDROP): When we start a maneuver to burn attitude [garble].
049:13:32 McDivitt (SPIDER): Say again?
049:13:33 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. When we maneuver, it will be to the burn attitude [garble].
049:13:42 McDivitt (SPIDER): It will [garble].
049:13:45 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay.
Long comm break.
049:17:39 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, if you read me, we will see you over the Redstone at 28. [Pause]
049:17:53 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Spider reads you. [Long pause]
MERCURY (REV 31)
049:18:13 McDivitt (SPIDER): Gumdrop, did you read them at that time?
049:18:15 Scott (GUMDROP): I think he said he would see us somewhere, sometime,
049:18:19 Schweickart (SPIDER): Yes, [garble].
049:18:21 Roosa: Okay, Gumdrop, Spider. That's Redstone at 28.
049:18:25 McDivitt (SPIDER): Now we read you loud and clear.
049:18:26 Scott (GUMDROP): Gumdrop the same.
049:18:30 Roosa: Okay. Well, we couldn't get you through tile Huntsville with an elevation angle of 9 degrees, and we can go through the Mercury with an elevation of 0.8.
049:18:41 McDivitt (SPIDER): Something wrong there.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 49 hours 18 minutes. We've completed communications at the Huntsville. During this pass, started at Carnarvon, we thought for a while there was a possibility of a descent propulsion system helium manifold leak. The crew started through a malfunction procedure. They have quite a number of checklists on board that have malfunction procedures in them for numerous systems' problems. We've watched it on board and we've watched it on the ground. We have now determined that there is not a leak. There is no problem with the descent propulsion system helium manifold. The crew also had some difficulty in initializing the backup guidance system from the primary guidance system. However, they successfully initialized the AGS prior to the end of this pass. There is no problem there. It's been determined that a thrust chamber pressure switch on the LM thruster B4 up in the reaction control system is stuck; however, the only effect of this will be that the caution and warning system will not detect an off failure, it will detect a thruster on failure, but not a thruster off failure. This is not considered a serious problem. So, essentially, we are up and ready for the docked descent propulsion system burn. The GO/NO-GO for this burn will be given over the Redstone. We acquire at the Redstone at 49:27:37, and should we get a go for the burn there, we're about 21 minutes away from the docked descent propulsion burn. We will come back up at the Redstone. This is Mission Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 49 hours 27 minutes. Apollo 9 coming within range of the Redstone.
REDSTONE (REV 31)
049:28:31 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston through the Redstone. [Long pause]
049:29:01 McDivitt (SPIDER): How does the direction look to you out there? [Pause]
049:29:10 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, Houston through the Redstone.
049:29:14 Schweickart (SPIDER): Yes, it looks like I am facing south.
049:29:20 Schweickart (SPIDER): I assume they gave us the docked DPS REFSMMAT, didn't they?
049:29:26 Scott (GUMDROP): He's checking. [Pause]
049:29:37 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop. Do you read? Houston.
049:29:44 Scott (GUMDROP): Gumdrop is with you.
049:29:48 Roosa: Okay, Gumdrop, I'm copying you. Would you pass on to Spider that when he arms the DPS he may get a descent REG warning light due to the low manifold pressure.
049:30:02 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Understand he may get a descent warning low light due to the low manifold pressure, right?
049:30:11 Roosa: That is descent REG warning light, and be may get that when he arms the DPS.
049:30:19 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Got you there. Descent REG warning on when he arms the DPS. You copy that, Spider?
049:30:23 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. REG warning when arm DPS.
049:30:28 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. That is what he said.
049:30:31 Roosa: Okay. Thank you, Gumdrop. And we are standing by for your burn.
049:30:35 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger.
049:30:38 McDivitt (SPIDER): And, Houston, do you want high bit rate here?
049:30:43 Scott (GUMDROP): Houston, Gumdrop. Do you want high bit rate out of the Spider?
049:30:45 Roosa: I copy, Spider then Gumdrop. Yes, we do want high bit rate.
049:30:51 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Affirmative on high bit rates, Spider. [Long pause]
049:31:37 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston. You are Go for the docked DPS burn.
049:31:40 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. We're GO.
049:31:42 Scott (GUMDROP): Gumdrop understands GO.
049:31:45 Roosa: And, Spider, we are copying you loud clear now.
049:31:49 McDivitt (SPIDER): Gumdrop, why don't you go to FREE, and we will take control here.
049:31:53 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Gumdrop is in FREE.

049:34:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, Gumdrop. It looks like our attitude's about right, looking out the window here at the ground.
049:34:14 Scott (Spider onboard): Roger, it looks about right to me, too.
GOLDSTONE (REV 32)
049:34:16 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Looks about right over here too.
049:34:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's only 1800 feet per second; it's about right - It's good enough, huh?

049:34:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Boy, it's going to be brighter than hell in here.
049:34:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, you're right. It sure is.
049:34:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Is your light up there - strongly?
049:35:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, it's strong.
049:35:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I guess it got to launch, didn't it? No, it wasn't going to.
049:35:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, uh huh. Don't move it back too far because I want, to be able to see thee thing.

049:39:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MFSTER ARM's ON.
049:39:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, stand by for 2 minutes.
049:39:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's see, turn THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO. We don't have that yet.
049:39:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, THROTTLE CONTROL, AUTO. Good. Thank you.
049:39:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
049:39:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): God, is that going to be bright!
049:39:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It sure is. Hooee.
049:39:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hmm.
049:39:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We're really oscillating around here in yaw. At 5 degrees. Okay. 2 minutes, verify the AGS attitude errors. [Garble] 0. Okay? Go.
049:39:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] reads 17:43.
049:39:51 Schweickart (SPIDER): A minute, 25 seconds, Gumdrop.
049:39:54 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. I'm with you. [Long pause]
049:39:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Standing by for 15 seconds; SEQUENCE CAMERA, ON, will be then. Begin ullage at 10; PROCEED at 5; ignition and then you're going to ...
049:40:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Going to try to get ...
049:40:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... turn the MASTER ARM, OFF.
049:40:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
049:40:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Or try too. Then you're going to throttle up at 5 seconds after ...
049:40:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Going to throttle up at 46 - 40 percent. Man, that is really bright. Alright, Houston. We're right over a white deck of clouds, and is it ever bright.
049:40:24 McDivitt (SPIDER): Boy, Houston. We are right over a white deck clouds and is it ever bright.
049:40:28 Roosa: Roger. Copy. [Pause]
049:40:36 McDivitt (SPIDER): One minute.
One minute.
049:40:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 4 ...
049:40:38 Roosa: Roger. Copy. One minute. Everything looks good. [Long pause]
049:40:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'm going to let the AGS go.
049:41:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, AVERAGE G coming ON.
049:41:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, make sure you are standing up straight, so you don't get knocked on your can.
049:41:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
049:41:07 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. 28 seconds. [Pause]
049:41:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You won't even feel it, hardly.
049:41:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
049:41:20 McDivitt (SPIDER): 15 seconds, Gumdrop.
049:41:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Camera's on.
049:41:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... camera's on; and it's going.
049:41:23 Scott (Spider onboard): Roger.
049:41:25 Scott (GUMDROP): Ullage on.
049:41:26 McDivitt (SPIDER): Ullage is on.
049:41:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): PROCEED. 3, 2, 1 -
049:41:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Have we ENABLED it?
049:41:32 Scott (GUMDROP): [Garble].
049:41:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): IGNITION. We got it. MASTER ARM, OFF.
049:41:39 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Ignition.
049:41:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Throttle up.
049:41:41 McDivitt (SPIDER): I'm throttling up to 40 percent, Dave.
049:41:45 McDivitt (SPIDER): It's 40 percent.
049:41:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Look at that ball; my God, we hardly have any errors.
049:41:50 Scott (GUMDROP): Stand by for the autopilot.
049:41:53 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Stand by for the autopilot. Descent REG light, now.
049:41:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): How's the pressure; it's going down?
049:42:00 Scott (GUMDROP): It's gone down ...
049:42:01 McDivitt (SPIDER): The pressure's gone down. Here comes the throttle up.
049:42:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, that pressure's going down, Jim.
049:42:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
049:42:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It's going back up.
049:42:09 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay, the pressure dropped down to about 190, there, Houston.
049:42:13 Roosa: Roger. We copied it, Spider.
049:42:15 McDivitt (SPIDER): We're fill throttle, and the attitude errors are practically nil, Davy.
049:42:19 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. Looks pretty good over here too.
049:42:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, and just a slightest transient.
049:42:22 McDivitt (SPIDER): Yes, ditto. Flying this thing [garble].
049:42:24 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. Your HP is 109 and holding.
049:42:27 McDivitt (SPIDER): Thank you. Got 440 to go.
049:42:29 Scott (GUMDROP): I've got 443. [Pause]
049:42:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): SEQUENCE CAMERA coming OFF at 59. SEQUENCE CAMERA, OFF.
049:42:36 McDivitt (SPIDER): I'm pulling 8/10 of a lunar g in case you're interested. We're starting to get a little excursion in high yaw.
049:42:42 Scott (Spider onboard): Roger, [garble].
049:42:43 Roosa: Roger. Copy.
049:42:44 Scott (GUMDROP): You surely can't see much out the tail end here.
049:42:49 McDivitt (SPIDER): We just threw a big hunk down on the ground there. There goes another hunk.
049:42:52 Scott (GUMDROP): Yes, I saw a few pieces go, too. [Pause]
049:43:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
049:43:02 Scott (GUMDROP): Gee, I got 405.
049:43:05 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. So do we.
049:43:07 Schweickart (SPIDER): And the PGNCS and AGS are count down right together.
049:43:10 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. 109.3 on the HP.
049:43:12 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. [Pause]
049:43:19 McDivitt (SPIDER): Man, am I hungry.
049:43:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Me too. Okay, you're standby for a ...
049:43:24 Scott (GUMDROP): Looks pretty smooth.
049:43:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, it really is, it's going along like a dream, except for all the hunk ...
049:43:25 McDivitt (SPIDER): Yes, it really is. It's going along like a dream.
049:43:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Except for all the hunk ...
049:43:28 Scott (GUMDROP): Sure losing pieces back there; some of the foil's coming off.
049:43:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
049:43:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
049:43:32 McDivitt (SPIDER): Yes. Hey, we're going over Texas right now, I think. We ought to be over Houston pretty soon.
049:43:40 Scott (GUMDROP): 03:30.
049:43:42 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. 03:30 here. Attitude errors are staying down to less than 1 degree.
049:43:47 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. 109.3 HP.
049:43:49 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay.
049:43:53 McDivitt (SPIDER): We have 1100 feet per second to go.
049:43:55 Scott (GUMDROP): Right with you.
049:43:57 Schweickart (SPIDER): Man, the AGS and the PGNCS are right together.
049:44:00 Schweickart (SPIDER): And for the information of the ground and the tape, the quantity is reading 76 and 74, and we don't seem to have any spurious lockups at this time.
049:44:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): REG ...
049:44:12 Roosa: Roger, Spider. Houston copies.
049:44:15 McDivitt (SPIDER): REG pressure is holding pretty steady; it's about 232.
049:44:20 Schweickart (SPIDER): And the landing radar temperature is reading 95 at the present and started, out at 81.
049:44:28 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. HP is 109.3, and everything's clean over here.
049:44:31 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay, same here. Looks like it's done a real good job of steering.
049:44:37 Schweickart (SPIDER): We've only got 890 feet per second left to go.
049:44:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
049:44:40 Scott (GUMDROP): I'm 885 when you called in.
049:44:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
049:44:42 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay.
049:44:43 Scott (GUMDROP): 229.
049:44:44 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. 225 here. [Pause]
049:44:51 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Roger. I going to start my, throttle profile at 124.
049:44:55 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. [Long pause]
049:44:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, and the SEQUENCE CAMERA's going to come back ON at 200; you're going to throttle at 1 [garble] 4 ...
049:45:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right.
049:45:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... at 10 I'm going to shut DESCENT REG 1, OFF. At cutoff ...
049:45:08 Scott (GUMDROP): I've got 2 minutes.
049:45:10 McDivitt (SPIDER): Two minutes here. I have 704.
049:45:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): At ...
049:45:13 Scott (GUMDROP): 109.2
049:45:15 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. [Pause]
049:45:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): At cutoff you're going to hit the ENGINE STOP button.
049:45:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): At 3 seconds, right.
049:45:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right, at 3 seconds.
049:45:21 Scott (GUMDROP): Your rates on all axes are less than a tenth of a degree per second.
049:45:25 McDivitt (SPIDER): Is that right? I'm going to go to attitude hold.
049:45:26 Schweickart (SPIDER): ... rates look solid here.
049:45:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] all that?
049:45:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
049:45:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
049:45:30 McDivitt (SPIDER): 600 feet per second to go.
049:45:33 Scott (GUMDROP): Right with you. [Pause]
049:45:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Gee, that's looking pretty, isn't it?
049:45:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
049:45:42 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. I've got about a minute, 25.
049:45:45 Scott (GUMDROP): Right with you.
049:45:47 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay, when I start throttle, we're going to add a lot of seconds on to that.
049:45:51 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. [Pause]
049:45:56 McDivitt (SPIDER): 450.
049:46:00 McDivitt (SPIDER): 420 to go. [Pause]
049:46:08 Scott (GUMDROP): One minute.
049:46:09 McDivitt (SPIDER): One minute now.
049:46:12 Scott (GUMDROP): 109.2.
049:46:14 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. Ranging right in there, isn't it?
049:46:16 Scott (GUMDROP): Yes, really slick.
049:46:17 Scott (GUMDROP): We are getting a roll, or some sort of an oscillation now. It's got ...
049:46:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Surely it's surging.
049:46:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. See if we're getting a roll surge. We're getting a roll, or some sort of an oscillation now, on it.
049:46:24 McDivitt (SPIDER): Hell, yes. We're getting slosh.
049:46:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, it's going - it's - we're getting slosh.
049:46:32 McDivitt (SPIDER): I've got 228 to go, and the camera coming back on.
049:46:34 Schweickart (SPIDER): Get ready for throttle profile.
049:46:37 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger.
049:46:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): The camera's ON.
049:46:39 Scott (GUMDROP): Thirty.
049:46:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 124.
049:46:42 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay, 170, 157, 145.
049:46:50 McDivitt (SPIDER): Firing the throttle, 4 percent. Going down to 10 percent. Coming back up to 40 percent. Back down to 25 percent. [Pause]
049:47:15 Schweickart (SPIDER): Back up again.
049:47:16 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Coming up to 40 percent. Throttle profile complete, and just let it sit there.
049:47:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Great, 27 seconds remaining.
049:47:21 Scott (GUMDROP): [Garble] point one.
049:47:22 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. 24 seconds to go.
049:47:28 McDivitt (SPIDER): I'm going to shut down the area at 3 seconds to go. I've got 18, 16, 15, 16, 13 ...
049:47:35 Schweickart (SPIDER): No sweat.
049:47:36 McDivitt (SPIDER): 12, 10, 9, 8 - get your hand out of - 6, 5, 4, 3, shutdown!
049:47:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Correct ATTITUDE HOLD.
049:47:46 Scott (GUMDROP): [Garble].
049:47:47 McDivitt (SPIDER): [Garble] attitude hold, here.
049:47:49 Scott (GUMDROP): Right with you, all the way.
049:47:50 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. [Pause]
049:47:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, SEQUENCE CAMERA coming OFF.
049:47:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
049:47:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, request the CSM - have it; ENGINE ARM ...
049:48:00 Roosa: And, Spider, that was a beautiful burn. Man, you were right down the tube.
049:48:04 McDivitt (SPIDER): Looked pretty neat from here, too. [Pause]
049:48:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ENGINE ARM to OFF.
049:48:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ENGINE ARM, OFF.
049:48:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, proceed. Okay, you want to read him those, while I copy them?
049:48:14 McDivitt (SPIDER): You want our residuals, Houston?
049:48:16 Roosa: I can copy them on your DSKY now, Spider.
049:48:19 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay, very good. [Pause]
049:48:25 McDivitt (SPIDER): Say, you know what? You really feel that stuff sloshing around here at the end. [Pause]
049:48:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, - PRO; VERB 79, ENTER; 00, ENTER ...
049:48:41 Scott (GUMDROP): I thought the MAX rate you got was about 3/10 of a degree per second.
049:48:47 McDivitt (SPIDER): Yes, with the offset that I had on my rate scale over here, I can't tell where zero is, but it didn't deviate hardly at all. [Pause]
049:48:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): TTC ...
049:48:52 Roosa: No, because you were oscillating right back, too.
049:48:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): TTCA JETS, DOWN.
049:49:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): JETS, DOWN.
049:49:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Verify ENGINE ARM, OFF.
049:49:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ENGINE ARM, OFF.
049:49:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ENGINE PUSHBUTTON STOP, RESET.
049:49:07 Roosa: That was mighty beautiful all the way, Spider.
049:49:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO.
049:49:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO.
049:49:14 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. [Pause]
049:49:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, landing radar temperature's 100?
049:49:19 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Landing radar temperature is 100 degrees right now.
049:49:22 Roosa: Roger. Copy. 100 degrees end of burn. [Pause]
049:49:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): PROP QUANTITY MONITOR, OFF.
049:49:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): PROP QUANTITY MONITOR coming OFF.
049:49:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, INVERTER to 2. And I may get a MASTER ALARM ...
049:49:36 Scott (Spider onboard): Even the EMS took care of you that time: 1740.6.
049:49:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): (Laughter)
049:49:41 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. [Long pause]
049:49:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, INVERTER 1, OPEN.
049:49:47 Scott (Spider onboard): Everybody's singing the same song.
049:49:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): INVERTER 1, OPENED.
049:49:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CROSS TIE/BALANCE LOADS, going CLOSED.
049:49:54 McDivitt (SPIDER): When you're in the groove, man, you got to do that! [Pause]
049:49:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): SEQUENCE CAMERA, OPEN.
049:50:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I want to read out 500.
049:50:05 Schweickart (SPIDER): Even the AGS were good; the AGS 500 degrees, plus 3 [garble]. [Pause]
049:50:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): One's reading minus 5. And 502 is reading 0.
049:50:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): And Davey, we're drifting now, so you have ATTITUDE CONTROL, again.
049:50:25 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. [Long pause]
049:50:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's see. We are, aren't we? We have a 76 in here, I think.
049:50:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, we do.
049:50:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): VERB 8 - Hit a VERB 82, ENTER.
049:50:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): VERB 82, ENTER. PRO.
049:50:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 273.0 by ...
049:50:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Dave, I - our orbit - is 273.0 by 109.2.
049:50:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... 109.2.
049:50:51 Roosa: And, Spider, Houston. I copy 500 501 502, plus 3, minus 5, minus 0. [Pause]
049:50:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's a Roger, and we got a 273.0 by 109.2. Cutoff at 2 minutes; the landing radar temperature is 100 degrees.
049:51:11 Scott (GUMDROP): And I got - the Gumdrop's got 271.7 by 109.1.
049:51:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 49:59 - 49:51.
049:51:18 Roosa: Roger, Gumdrop. Houston, copy. [Pause]
049:51:28 McDivitt (SPIDER): Exciting, the way the fuel and oxide pressures dropped off, there, during the sputter.
049:51:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, R&D TELEMETRY CAL, ON.
049:51:40 McDivitt (SPIDER): Houston, you are going to get a DFI CAL.
049:51:46 Roosa: Roger. Understand you're getting DFI CAL. [Long pause]
049:52:14 McDivitt (SPIDER): Houston, how long do we have to that burn 5?
049:52:18 Roosa: Stand by one, Spider.
049:52:23 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay, I'm going to get something to eat. All I've had so far today is a little bag of fruit salad. I'm about to starve to death, and I'm going to try to get something to eat right after we finish this burn.
049:52:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We start the dry-out - Let's start the dry-out first.
049:52:37 McDivitt (SPIDER): DFI CAL complete.
049:52:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. DFI POWER, OFF, but don't open the - the breaker.
049:52:41 Roosa: Spider, Houston.
049:52:44 McDivitt (SPIDER): DFI power is off.
049:52:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, LANDING RADAR breaker, OPEN.
049:52:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): LANDING RADAR's OPEN.
049:52:49 Roosa: Spider, Houston.
049:52:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Go ahead.
049:52:53 McDivitt (SPIDER): Houston, Spider.
049:52:54 Roosa: All right, we're going to do SPS-5 at the nominal time, and that's 4 hours and a half from now.
049:53:01 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Very good. Thank you.
049:53:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you want to debrief the burn anymore?
049:53:03 Roosa: Roger. [Pause]
049:53:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
049:53:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, ignition was slow.
049:53:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, stand - stand by just 1 -
049:53:13 Schweickart (SPIDER): Gumdrop, Spider.
049:53:15 Scott (GUMDROP): Go.
049:53:16 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. We'd like to stop at an AGS CAL attitude here somewhere.
049:53:20 Scott (GUMDROP): Very well.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We are still in acquisition at the Vanguard, and we'll have overlapping coverage at the Canaries.
049:53:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): At ignition the chamber pressure went up very gradually to 10 percent. Slow, smooth, steady, no bump or anything. It just felt like somebody was sort of turning the water faucet on. I came OFF with the MASTER ARM, we got the - we got the MASTER ALARM on when I did that at a couple of seconds. I throttle on up to 40 percent. That throttle up I didn't make abruptly; the throttle - and the - the chamber pressure seemed to stay right together. I stopped at 40 and it did. I [garble] throttle up manually to - to automatic. We were 100 percent [garble]. Now the attitude excursions I got during this time were practically nil, and the same thing with the rate. They're just practically nil and when we throttled up to 100 percent, the same thing: they're very low attitude excursions, very low rates. Considering - that we didn't have any attitude control [garble] except at slow engine, we did very well. It ran along steadily at 100 percent or 97 - percent - The chamber pressure looked like it went up and down from about 90 to 100 percent during the burn. It went along smoothly and right at the end, we were - we were feeling some surging and it looked like it was - it was controlling a little more in yaw than I expected it would. And we got a little roll rate in, but much less than a degree per second. Then we figured really - figures - probably the - the fuel sloshing around - the fuel oxidizer sloshing around in the tanks, and was probably the slosh. Now, you couldn't really see anything in the ball. I looked carefully at it, and I didn't see any attitude excursions, and I only saw that very slight [garble] bit of roll rate, but it was in a different frequency than the thing I felt. The - PGNS, the AGS, the G&N over the command module, and everybody all counted down together. About a minute and - about 130 - turn that off - At 130 feet per second we went to manual throttle and throttled right down to 40 percent. I got hold of the throttle and let it sit there for a couple of seconds, and then down to 10 percent, then up to 40, down to 25, back up to 40, and nominally we were supposed to get there at 30 seconds. I got there, I think, at 29 seconds to go. Then we just let it cruise on out, and no trans into here again. We shut the thing down [garble] to end ...
The voice heard most frequently from the Spider was Jim McDivitt's, and he is the one that got hungrey in the middle of the burn. Rusty Schweickart did come up several times with some radar temperatures and with one "No sweat" comment. The flight surgeon was monitoring one man in each vehicle during that burn, Jim McDivitt in the LM and Dave Scott in the Command Module. He reported the range of heart rates for Commander Jim McDivitt 107 to 87; for Dave Scott 97 to 60, with the high rate coming just prior to ignition in each case. We'll continue to stand by live through the Canaries.
Apollo Control, initial tracking shows the orbit 270 by 109, which is what we were shooting for. We will continue to refine that.
CANARY (REV 32)
049:56:00 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay, Spider. I'll have it over to you in about 3 minutes.
Comm break.
049:56:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. We shut down at the end. Rates were very low, and we gradually pitched up; no roll and no yaw; but it pitched up very gradually, much less than a degree per second. We got the manual shutdown at about 2 or 3 seconds. We got the regulators off; and I'll let you - Russ - to tell you about that. The regulator pressure - at that time, fuel and oxidizer pressures, were 232 when we started, and they went on down to about 185, then gradually built back up again to 230, until when they ran at 232, the whole time. The SUPERCRIT PRESSURE got up to 830 during the burn and that's where it sits right now.
049:56:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Looks like it might have been the quad that caused the heater light there at about 20 seconds before the cutoff.
049:56:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, I didn't see that.
049:56:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Because quad 3 is now reading 185, 2 is reading 162, 3 is reading 185, and 4 is reading 152.
049:57:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Looks like we used a fair amount of fuel in system B, too.
049:57:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Couple of percent, there, huh?
049:57:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, and we were supposed to be off scale HIGH for a long time. And, that's interesting, tape. We're reading in the RCS quad - or the RCS quantity right now. About 99, I guess, on A, and about 97 on B, and I think they're supposed to be considerably higher than that. Too bad I don't have a - another camera; I could really take some pretty pictures. Or do we; no, it's all stowed away. There'll come another day for the pictures, I guess. We're crossing Africa. Alrighty, the temperature is 70 our fuel, 67 our oxidizer, reading 240 and 242 fuel and oxidizer; that's on DESCENT 1. DESCEIT 2 is 70, 69, 240, and 242. I think that terminates my debriefing.
049:58:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I don't have much to add at all. Prop - the main propulsion quantity seemed to track pretty good. The [garble] radar climbed very slowly during the burn from about 81 at start, to close to 100, and it's now reading about 108 and the time is 49: [garble] 8:30? That's about all I've got. The HEATER caution - We got the MASTER ALARM due to shutting the MASTER ARM off right at the start.
049:58:47 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay, Spider, Gumdrop. That ought to be pretty close.
049:58:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger; that's good, if you'll go to FREE.
049:58:53 Scott (Spider onboard): In FREE.
049:58:55 McDivitt (SPIDER): [Garble]. [Long pause]
049:58:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger.
049:59:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And, [garble] popping that I know of. The HEATER caution light on panel 2 came ON ...
049:59:22 Roosa: Spider, Houston. [Pause]
049:59:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... 50 just before the end of the burn. Go [garble]; Houston.
049:59:31 Schweickart (SPIDER): This is Spider. Go ahead.
049:59:32 Roosa: Roger. Spider, we would like to ask you if, after you finish eating there, before you transfer back, if there would be any chance of getting the regulator check, checklist systems page 17. [Pause]
049:59:52 McDivitt (SPIDER): Yes. Okay.
049:59:56 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. We'll get it.
049:59:58 Roosa: Okay. Thank you.
049:59:59 Schweickart (SPIDER): [Garble].
050:00:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, that's about all I've got here.
050:00:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
050:00:02 McDivitt (SPIDER): I'm going to eat first, though, before I just drop over up here.
050:00:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I'm going to turn the tape off.
050:00:04 Roosa: Roger. I just wanted to pass that on, before you dismantled something. We would really like to see you go ahead and eat, and we'll see you over Tananarive about 13. [Pause]
050:00:18 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger.
050:00:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger. Okay, let me give you a hack, Dave.
050:00:21 Roosa: And, Spider, we would like to have low bit rate.
050:00:28 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Low.
Very long comm break.
050:00:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What did you want, Rusty?
050:00:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Nothing. Okay, tape, it's - Now, my mark is going to be 50:00:45. 4, 3, 2, 1 -
050:00:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
050:00:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 50:00:45, and I'm going to turn you off.
This is Apollo Control at 50 hours 2 minutes. Canaries has loss of signal. A very successful descent propulsion burn just completed. A lot of good graphic commentary from the crew. Jim McDivitt eating now. As soon as he completes this meal, he will transfer back into the command module. Rusty Schweickart will stay aboard the LM for an additional hour, tying it down and waiting for the sublimator or water boiler to dry out before he transfers back into the command module shortly after 51 hours. The next station to acquire will be Tananarive at 50 hours 13 minutes. This is Mission Control Houston.
050:04:07 Schweickart (onboard): And, Gumdrop, you're cleared to maneuver as desired.
050:04:11 Scott (onboard): Okay.
This is Apollo Control at 50 hours, 12 minutes and Tananarive is about to acquire Apollo 9. We will standby.
TANANARIVE (REV 32)
050:13:50 Roosa: Apollo 9 - excuse me. Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
050:1X:XX Communication Technician TANANARIVE: Tananarive M&O Houston COMM TECH network.
050:1X:XX Communication Technician HOUSTON: Houston COMM TECH [garbled].
050:1X:XX Communication Technician TANANARIVE: Roger, verified CAPCOM is uplinking to your site.
050:1X:XX Communication Technician HOUSTON: [Garbled].
050:1X:XX Communication Technician TANANARIVE: Thank you.
This is Apollo Control at 50 hours, 18 minutes. Cap Com Stu Roosa has just advised us that he will not try to communicate through Tananarive. Very noisy - communications are bad and he figures the crew is eating and he doesn't want to disturb them. So we will take this line down. If we do get a call from the spacecraft, we'll come back up. This is Mission Control Houston.
050:20:17 Schweickart (onboard): Gumdrop, Spider. Are you starting to clear the tunnel yet?
050:20:23 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, fine, Davey.
050:20:25 McDivitt (onboard): I think we ought to skip that REG's check. I've got to get something to eat here, and we're starting a sublimator dryout. We'll just go ahead and skip the REG's check.
050:20:43 Scott (onboard): Okay.
050:20:55 Scott (onboard): You got anything to eat over there?
050:21:00 McDivitt (onboard): Yes, Dave. I've got something to eat.
050:23:13 Scott (onboard): Okay, Spider, I'm ready to clear the tunnel out if you're ready to go with it.
050:23:18 McDivitt (onboard): Yes, why don't you go ahead and clear the tunnel out, Dave, so we can start getting back on the command module ECS? We've cut the sublimator off over here, and it's kind of dried out, and we want to get off of this thing.
050:26:57 Schweickart (onboard): Gumdrop, is your tunnel - is the tunnel pressurized?
050:27:03 Schweickart (onboard): That's a negative?
050:27:05 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, let us know when it is.
050:27:15 Schweickart (onboard): Say the word; we can pressurize it for you if you like.
050:27:20 Scott (onboard): [Garble].
050:27:22 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, we'll do it.
050:27:54 McDivitt (onboard): Hey, Dave. I pressurized the tunnel, but it might be at a higher pressure than you have there in the spacecraft. Make sure you open up that pressure valve in the tunnel hatch.
050:28:06 Scott (onboard): [Garble] it looks like we're getting about a 0.1 differential right now.
050:28:10 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
CARNARVON (REV 32)
050:29:53 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston. Spider, we would like to have high bit rate.
050:30:03 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. High bit rate, Houston.
050:30:06 Roosa: Roger. Copy. And I've got you through Carnarvon. You are five-square.
This is Apollo Control and we are at Carnarvon now.
050:30:13 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Understand. Five-square, and we've already started the waterboiler dryout. We will do the REG check tomorrow.
050:30:21 Roosa: Roger. Understand. You will do the REG check tomorrow. [Pause]
050:30:34 Roosa: And Spider - we would like - if you agree - to do a VHF B check here and secondary S-band check. [Pause]
050:30:49 McDivitt (SPIDER): Okay. Go ahead.
050:30:52 Roosa: Roger, Spider. We would like to do a VHF B check here, if you agree.
050:31:00 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. We agree. Go ahead with your instructions.
050:31:03 Roosa: Roger. Stand by one. [Long pause]
050:31:32 Roosa: Spider, Houston. Roger. Could we get some AGS calibration data? [Pause]
050:31:41 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Stand by.
050:31:43 Roosa: Roger. [Pause]
050:31:48 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. You ready to copy?
050:31:52 Roosa: Spider, let's configure your spacecraft for [garble] B operation and I will copy your calibration data as a COMM check.
050:32:04 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. We are on B. Do you read?
050:32:07 Roosa: Okay. Carnarvon M&O, this is the Houston CAP COMM. I want you to REMOTE VHF B only. [Pause]
050:32:18 Roosa: Carnarvon M&O, did you read? Houston CAP COMM. [Pause]
050:32:28 Schweickart (SPIDER): Houston, Apol - Spider. How do you read?
050:32:31 Roosa: I'm reading you five-square. Let's go with the AGS calibration data.
050:32:35 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. The initial readings are the same as final readings before, right?
050:32:41 Roosa: Okay.
050:32:43 Schweickart (SPIDER): Plus all zips, plus all zips, minus all 7's, plus 21, plus 36, and minus 20. [Pause]
050:32:55 Roosa: Okay. We've got that on the tape. That was a little fast.
050:33:00 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. Here is the final data after the CAL. It was plus all zips, plus all zips, minus all 7's. [Pause]
050:33:12 Roosa: Copy.
050:33:15 Schweickart (SPIDER): And stand by here.
050:33:18 Roosa: Roger.
050:33:19 Schweickart (SPIDER): Hey, I beg your pardon. I powered down before I read them out.
050:33:24 Roosa: Roger. Understand.
050:33:27 Schweickart (SPIDER): Stand by just one. I'll power back up and read them out. [Long pause]
050:34:23 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay, Houston. Are you still with us?
050:34:26 Roosa: That is affirmative. We've got you here for another 6 minutes or so across Carnarvon.
050:34:31 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. 54445 and 46 read: plus 7, plus 28, and plus 0.
050:34:42 Roosa: Roger. Copy plus 7 plus 28, plus 0. Thank you very much, and we do have a good VHF B system. Could you give us a secondary S-band check as per system 28 at this time? [Pause]
050:35:03 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Stand by. [Pause]
050:35:10 Roosa: And Carnarvon M&O this is Houston CAP COMM. I would like for you to REMOTE S-band back to Houston. [Long pause]
050:35:30 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay, Houston. How do you read now?
050:35:34 Roosa: I'm reading you loud and clear, Spider.
050:35:37 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. That's step 1. I'm ready to go to step 2.
050:35:40 Roosa: All right. Let's go to step 2. [Long pause]
050:36:00 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay, Houston.
050:36:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): How do you read now?
050:36:04 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. Do you read?
050:36:07 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger, Houston. How do you read Spider?
050:36:10 Roosa: That's beautiful. That's loud and clear, Spider.
050:36:14 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Same here.
050:36:16 Roosa: Okay. That takes care of that. We are ready for step 3.
050:36:19 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Going to step 3. [Long pause]
050:36:41 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay, Houston. How do you read Spider now?
050:36:43 Roosa: You are five-square, Rusty. That is real nice. Everything sounds great on that check. And while we've got you in the mood, would you care to do an S-band backup voice check? That's on page ...
050:37:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): He doesn't come in worth a damn on PRIMARY.
050:37:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Alright.
050:37:04 Schweickart (SPIDER): Houston, Spider. Try that once again.
050:37:08 Roosa: While we've got you in the mood, would you care to try an S-band backup voice check as per systems 27?
050:37:16 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. I just got the last two words of that. Say again. [Pause]
050:37:21 Roosa: An S-band backup voice check, as the checklist system 27. [Pause]
050:37:30 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. [Long pause]
050:37:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, Houston, how do you read on backup voice?
050:38:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Houston, this is Apollo 9 - or Spider. How do you read on backup voice?
050:38:21 Schweickart (SPIDER): Houston, this is Spider. How do you read on backup voice?
050:38:24 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. Loud and clear. How me? [Pause]
050:38:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger. You're 5 square. How do you read me now?
050:38:34 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. How do you read me on the backup voice? [Pause]
050:38:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You're 5 square, Houston. How do you read me?
050:38:43 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. I'm reading you loud and clear. How do you read me? [Pause]
050:38:58 Roosa: Gumdrop, Spider, this is Houston through Carnarvon.
050:39:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Houston, how do you read Spider now?
050:39:02 Schweickart (SPIDER): [Garble] is better now.
050:39:04 Scott (onboard): Gumdrop, 5 by.
050:39:05 Roosa: Spider, you're loud and clear. How me?
050:39:06 McDivitt (onboard): I'd like to go private with you.
050:39:08 Roosa: You cut each other ...
050:39:09 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay, you are five-square. I'm supposed to be able to talk to you without pushing PIT. I'm not sure I'm getting backup voice down to you. Tell me if you read up through 5 and back down. 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1.
050:39:26 Roosa: Okay. Spider, Houston. You blanked out at 3 on the way up and came in with 3 on the way down.
050:39:35 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. I was using PTT up to 3 and from 3 on down, and I understood the backup voice was supposed to go right off the intercom.
050:39:49 Roosa: Spider, check BIOMED OFF, and give me another fast check. [Pause]
050:40:01 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. The BIOMED is OFF.
050:40:06 Roosa: Roger. Verify BIOMED OFF. [Pause]
HONEYSUCKLE (REV 32)
050:40:17 Roosa: Okay, Spider. We've got you through Honeysuckle now. How are you reading me? [Long pause]
050:40:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Houston, how do you read Spider?
050:40:58 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston through Honeysuckle. How do you read me? [Pause]
050:41:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger. Reading you 5 square. How me?
050:41:04 Schweickart (SPIDER): [Garble].
050:41:08 Roosa: Okay, Spider. I could hear you transmitting there. You were way down and breaking up. How about giving me a short count here? We are supposed to be locked up on you.
050:41:20 Schweickart (SPIDER): One, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, [garble] Spider out.
050:41:25 Roosa: Okay, Spider. You are relatively clear, but way, way down.
050:41:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] what did you want with the biomed?
050:41:31 Schweickart (SPIDER): [Garble] BIOMED. [Long pause]
050:41:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It is off.
050:41:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Houston, did you want the - something done with the biomed?
050:42:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Houston, Spider. Over.
050:42:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Aw - Houston, Spider.
050:42:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Houston, Spider. Over.
050:42:22 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. We'd like to have you return to COMM basic. [Long pause]
050:42:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger. Going back to COMM BASIC. And I'm going back to VHF A.
050:42:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Is that tunnel open?
050:42:58 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. I'd like to have you return to COMM basic and give me a check.
050:43:03 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger, Houston. We are COMM basic. How now?
050:43:07 Roosa: Okay. You're coming through clear now, Rusty. And we get the backup voice check in. It just way down low. [Pause]
050:43:17 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger.
050:43:20 Roosa: And we'd like to have the BIOMED switch on the LMP for the rest of the time, Spider. [Pause]
050:43:33 Scott (GUMDROP): Spider, Gumdrop.
050:43:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, Gumdrop; Spider.
050:43:35 Scott (GUMDROP): The tunnel is clear.
050:43:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, very good. [Garble].
050:43:40 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger. It is on the LMP, Houston.
050:43:43 Roosa: Roger. Understand. Thank you, Spider.
050:43:48 McDivitt (SPIDER): Be advised we are presently 28 minutes into the sublimator dryout. [Pause]
050:44:01 Roosa: Roger Spider. I copy that. 28 minutes into the dryout. [Pause]
050:44:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger, and be advised that we have a great deal more equipment powered up than we were supposed to during this dry-out. We're running a little behind in getting the tunnel clear.
050:44:05 McDivitt (SPIDER): Roger and [garble].
050:44:12 Roosa: Okay, Spider. You are breaking up. You will have to repeat that for me, please. [Pause]
050:44:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I'll finish up the checklist, Jim.
050:44:29 Roosa: No VHF -
050:44:32 Roosa: Okay, Spider and Gumdrop. I think we are about to drop you here at Honeysuckle. We'll be over Huntsville in a couple of minutes if you want to talk there and Hawaii at 59.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. Gumdrop and Spider are over the Huntsville now. We'll stay up live through this pass. Flight Dynamics Officer Dave Reed reports the orbit now as 108.9 by 271.2 nautical miles.
050:44:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Did you get an EVA checklist, Jim, over there?
050:44:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, I didn't. Let me get this - let me get this stuff out of the way so we can get the hatch open. [Garble].
050:45:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
050:45:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble].
050:45:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Soon as you get that hatch open, we want to go to EGRESS.
050:45:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What?
050:45:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I say we want to go to EGRESS mode.
050:45:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Okay, let's do that.
050:45:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Go.
050:45:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): PULL the EGRESS. [Garble].
050:45:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): The REG's to EGRESS, right.
050:45:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] A, [garble] B.
050:47:52 Scott (Spider onboard): Spider, Gumdrop.
050:47:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble].
050:47:57 Scott (Spider onboard): My, it stare takes you guys a long time to open that little hatch here.
050:48:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] ready for us?
050:48:02 Scott (Spider onboard): Sure. Been ready for 10 minutes.
050:48:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we'll be opening in a second here. [Garble] ready, Jim.
050:48:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, I have the hatch open now.
050:48:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble].
050:49:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, ready?
050:49:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] get that umbilical down here, and I got to get off this suit loop.
050:49:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I know it.
050:49:23 Scott (Spider onboard): Tell him to send the umbilical through.
050:49:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's going to be hard for you to get through, Jim.
050:49:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What?
050:49:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's going to be too hard for you to get through.
050:49:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Are you - Do you want me to sit here and clear this stuff out, Rusty, or -
050:50:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, Jim.
050:50:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You sure?
050:50:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, thanks.
050:50:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, Dave? Hey, Dave? Hey, Dave?
050:51:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What do we need to take back with us to the [garble]? The EVA checklist -
050:51:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): EVA checklist, and the Flight Plan card. The sequence camera and the lenses.
050:51:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's right. I checked - I checked the [garble].
050:52:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] the camera.
050:52:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Hey, Russ, let me [garble] here.
050:52:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
050:52:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We'll make a transfer and see if [garble].
050:52:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
050:52:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble].
050:52:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
050:53:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] I'll be back in just a second.
050:53:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Rusty, do you [garble]?
050:53:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I [garble] think so.
050:53:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] Well, come over here [garble] gloves on.
050:54:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Dave, [garble] Dave. Dave, [garble].
050:54:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Make that [garble].
050:55:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble].
050:55:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble].
050:55:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I don't think so. Hey, let me plot one more point on it here.
050:55:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble].
050:55:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No.
050:56:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, I'll take [garble] over there.
050:56:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Slow down. And I pass that umbilical back.
050:56:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Got it, Dave?
This is Apollo Control 50 hours 56 minutes. The Huntsville has loss of signal. Hawaii will acquire at 50 hours 58 and a half minutes. This is Mission Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 51 hours, and Hawaii is tagging up now with Gumdrop and Spider; we'll stand by.
HUNTSVILLE (REV 32)
050:58:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Alright.
050:58:03 Schweickart (SPIDER): Gumdrop, Spider.
050:58:04 Scott (GUMDROP): Go ahead [garble].
050:58:06 Scott (Spider onboard): Did you ever mount your [garble]?
050:58:08 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. Stands by. Not yet.
050:58:12 Scott (GUMDROP): What do you need?
050:58:15 Schweickart (SPIDER): Just checking the COMM. [Long pause]
HAWAII (REV 32)
050:58:41 Roosa: And Gumdrop, this is Houston. We've got you through Hawaii now.
050:58:45 Scott (GUMDROP): Gumdrop. Roger. [Long pause]
050:58:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Anything else you wanted, Rusty?
050:59:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, you got to get that checklist going fast. Shoot, I can't get my hose plugged in. God damn it.
050:59:20 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston. We'd like to turn the heaters and H2 tanks 1 and 2 off.
050:59:27 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay. Have to stand by for that one.
050:59:29 Roosa: Roger. Understand. No sweat. [Pause]
050:59:38 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. I'd like to give flow to you. [Pause]
050:59:53 Schweickart (SPIDER): Gumdrop, can you give me call? [Pause]
051:00:08 Scott (GUMDROP): You've got full flow, haven't you?
051:00:10 Schweickart (SPIDER): I don't know; I can't tell.
051:00:12 Scott (GUMDROP): Yes, I gave it to you when you first called it. [Long pause]
051:00:40 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay. I'm going to switch COMMS so give me a few seconds and then turn my suit power off.
051:00:46 Scott (GUMDROP): Okay.
Comm break.
051:02:30 Scott (GUMDROP): Houston, say again the heaters and fans.
051:02:35 Roosa: Roger, Gumdrop. We would like to turn off the heaters in both H2 tanks.
051:02:41 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Both H2 heaters OFF.
051:02:44 Roosa: Roger. Thank you.
Long comm break.
051:07:57 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston. You might watch your middle gimbal.
051:08:02 Scott (GUMDROP): Roger. Thanks, Houston; got an eye on it. [Pause]
051:08:19 Scott (GUMDROP): We got two eyes on it. [Pause]
051:08:28 Schweickart (SPIDER): Houston, this is the Spider.
051:08:30 Roosa: Go, Spider.
051:08:33 Schweickart (SPIDER): Roger. We've been running the dry-on now for 52 minutes and we are just starting the circulator pull out and the glycol temperature is right now 70 degrees. We are [garble] through it. [Long pause]
051:08:44 Roosa: Roger. Copy.
Comm break.
GOLDSTONE (REV 32)
051:11:00 Roosa: And Gumdrop, this is Houston. Just to remind you again about the gimbal lock. You are just making us nervous.
051:11:08 McDivitt (GUMDROP): Roger. We've got somebody in the couch watching it at all time now.
051:11:12 Roosa: All right. Okay. Thank you.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control. Jim McDivitt back in the command module now. We expect Rusty Schweickart to start moving into the command module within a very few minutes.
051:13:19 Scott (GUMDROP): Houston, this is Gumdrop. How do you read?
051:13:24 Roosa: Gumdrop, we read you loud and clear.
051:13:26 Schweickart (SPIDER): Okay, this is Spider. I figure our water boiler is dry at 57 minutes, and we have a lot of power on, and I want to give you a CAL here.
051:13:35 Roosa: Roger. You must be a mind reader; that's just what we were thinking.
Long comm break.
TEXAS (REV 33)
051:17:57 Scott (GUMDROP): Houston, this is Apollo 9.
051:18:02 Roosa: Calling Houston. Say again, please; I didn't get it, Gumdrop. [Long pause]
051:18:29 Roosa: Gumdrop, this is Houston. I did not copy your last transmission. [Long pause]
051:18:48 Roosa: Gumdrop, this is Houston. I did not copy your last transmission.
Comm break.
BAHAMAS (REV 33)
051:20:00 Roosa: Gumdrop, this is Houston. How do you read?
051:20:05 McDivitt: Five-by, Houston. Go.
051:20:06 Roosa: Roger, I'm reading you real good now. I couldn't copy off Texas there. You made a transmission; I did not get it.
051:20:13 Schweickart: Roger, Houston. This is Apollo 9, we would like to know what the position of our translunar bus tie circuit breakers are supposed to be. They are both circuit breaker panel 11 and 16.
051:20:25 Roosa: Roger, Apollo 9. Copy. Stand by.
051:20:28 Schweickart: Just for when we're leaving the spacecraft.
051:20:32 Roosa: Roger. Understand. [Long pause]
051:20:51 Roosa: Okay, Apollo 9. Those translunar bus tie circuit; breakers are to be OPEN, I say OPEN.
051:20:58 Schweickart: Both of them will be OPEN. Roger.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control 51 hours 23 minutes. Apollo 9 over the Grand Bahamas station now, Rusty Schweickart has just returned to the command module. All three crewmen have their biomedical harnesses pluged in. Schweickart heart rate running about 60, Dave Scott is showing 63, and Jim McDivitt in the mid-seventies. We will continue to stand by through Antigua which is just acquiring.
VANGUARD (REV 33)
051:30:17 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. About 1 minute LOS Vanguard. We will see you over Ascension at 36.
051:30:26 Scott: Roger.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control 51 hours 31 minutes. We have LOS at the Vanguard. All three crewmen back in the command module. The LM powered down and closed out, is now being supplied with what little power it needs from the command module. Next station to acquire will be Ascension at 51 hours 35 minutes, about 3-1/2 minutes from now. This is Mission Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 51 hours, 35 minutes. Apollo 9 coming up on the Ascension station now. We'll standby through this pass.
ASCENSION (REV 33)
051:36:37 Roosa: Apollo 9, this is Houston through Ascension. Standing by.
051:36:42 Scott: Roger, Houston. Apollo 9.
Comm break.
051:39:36 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. No need to acknowledge, but we are showing you with - you'll probably get a MASTER ALARM in about a minute on the H2 pressure.
051:39:48 McDivitt: Houston, you are off by about 59 seconds on that one. It came on while you were talking. Very good.
051:39:54 Roosa: Okay. Thank you.
051:4X:XX Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. We're going to lose you at Ascension in about a minute. We'll see you over Tananarive at around five-one.
051:4X:XX Schweickart: Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control - 51 hours, 44 minutes and Ascension has LOS after a very quite pass. Next station to acquire will be Tananarive at 51 hours, 50 and one-half minutes. This is Mission Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control 51 hours 50 minutes. Apollo 9 coming up on Tananarive now; however, the network officer just informed the Flight Director that Tananarive is down. It doesn't have voice capability this pass, technical problems at the station. If we regain capability at Tananarive, we will come back up. The next station to acquire will be Carnarvon at 52 hours 7 minutes. This is Mission Control Houston at 51 hours 50 minutes.
This is Apollo Control, 52 hours 5 minutes, we're about a minute away from the Carnarvon acquisition. In the meantime, I would like to recapitulate here on the EVA situation. EVA has not been eliminated at this time. The ground intends to talk to the crew about the possibility of eliminating it just prior to the rest period this evening, and perhaps again in the morning after the crew has awakened. However, at this time, the EVA has not been eliminated and we will have a conversation with the crew just prior to the rest period this evening concerning EVA. We'll stand by now for the Carnarvon pass.
CARNARVON (REV 33)
052:07:30 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston, through Carnarvon, standing by.
052:07:36 Scott: Roger, Houston, Apollo 9.
052:07:38 Roosa: Roger. We're going to have you here for about 11 minutes at Carnarvon, and if you can handle it we would like to initiate a waste water dump at this time and dump it down to 25 percent.
052:07:51 Unidentifiable crewmember: Okay, waste water down to 25. We're all back in the Gumdrop, the tunnel is closed out, and everything looks okay.
052:07:59 Roosa: Say, sounds great, Apollo 9. [Long pause]
052:08:50 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, this is Houston. Just at your convenience, when you have a couple of three minutes to talk I've got several questions that can be handled at any time. I'd just like to start working down the list before we get too close in to the burn.
052:09:07 McDivitt: Okay, stand by.
052:09:09 Roosa: Roger. [Long pause]
052:10:00 McDivitt: Go ahead Houston, Apollo 9.
052:10:03 Roosa: Roger. There are a couple of questions we have, and one is on the adjustment of this VOX sensitivity during our COMM test. We're trying our best to troubleshoot some of our difficulties, and we would like to have any comments that you could give us in that regard.
052:10:24 McDivitt: Well, we finally ended up with the VOX sensitivity about 8 and a half or 9. We still weren't getting the PLSS to the ground, though. We should read him from ...
052:10:45 Roosa: I'm sorry, you broke out there, Apollo 9, said you could read and then say again all after.
052:10:51 McDivitt: I'm thinking.
052:10:53 Roosa: Oh, okay. I'm sorry. [Long pause]
052:11:10 McDivitt: Houston, we were reading - we had communications from the PLSS to the CSM, from the CSM back to the PLSS. I guess we were just having trouble getting to the ground, and even though I had the VOX sensitivity up to about 8 and a half or 9, which is about as high as it goes, we still weren't able to get him to trigger the VOX, I guess.
052:11:39 Roosa: Roger, copy, and you know I wasn't getting the CSM at all, in the Texas-Mila pass, and down over the Mercury you came in loud and clear. It looked like, at one time there during the Mercury, we were going to have real good COMM, and then it got ratty again. Okay, that's enough of that one, then, unless TELL-COMM will come up with some more questions. If you have anything else to add on it they would like to take it at this time.
052:12:08 McDivitt: No, I don't believe so.
052:12:09 Roosa: Okay, And I'm curious about the foil coming off of the Spider during the burn. Were they, you know, large chunks, small, is there anything you would like elaborate on that?
052:12:29 McDivitt: I couldn't say. The stuff I saw I couldn't say for sure was foil. I think Dave said that - just a minute.
052:12:34 Scott: Yes, looked like there were some pieces, maybe 2 to 3 inches square in area, but not square in dimension. They weren't clean pieces like something that was supposed to be there left. It looked it might have been scraps or something that had been hanging loose, but I did see some that were black and some that were partially black and silver, and they came off pretty fast, so it was hard to track them.
052:13:04 McDivitt: That's kind of - They stayed with us. They didn't look like they were being shot out of the engine or anything. They stayed with us and we sort of left them, but not too rapidly, and they were sort of down between from us toward the ground, and I couldn't tell exactly where they originated.
052:13:22 Scott: Yes, I couldn't tell where they came from either.
052:13:27 Roosa: Okay, Apollo 9, copied that. That was a real good description, and the other question I was wondering if you would care to comment if in all that hubbub if you had a change to try out the LM drinking fountain.
052:13:46 McDivitt: Roger. I did, and there seemed to be appreciably less water in the LM system than there was - I mean in the LM system than there is in the command module. It's much better over there.
052:14:00 Roosa: Okay. How was the temperature of the water? [Pause]
052:14:11 McDivitt: It was pretty good; it was cool. It was very tolerable.
052:14:16 Roosa: Okay, sounds great, and I would like, if you haven't buried them, the battery voltages and so forth that was on the closeout checklist, they're system 74, at your convenience. [Long pause]
052:14:55 McDivitt: Battery check voltages, Houston?
052:14:59 Roosa: I'm ready to copy, Apollo 9.
052:15:02 McDivitt: Roger. Batteries 1 through 4 with 31 volts. Battery 5 and 6 were 37. Commander's BUS and System Engineer's BUS were 31 and 31. ED BAT A was 36.5, ED BAT B was 37.2.
052:15:21 Roosa: Roger, very good, Apollo 9. We got those. [Pause]
052:15:37 McDivitt: Tonight, probably after this next burn, I'd like to go over with you what we are going to do tomorrow.
052:15:43 Roosa: Okay, very good, we agree to that.
052:15:48 Unidentifiable crewmember: Do you have a plan for us, or are you open for suggestions, or what?
052:15:54 Roosa: Roger. We would rather wait until after the burn and then we can get together and have a meeting of the minds.
052:16:02 McDivitt: Okay.
052:16:06 Roosa: That pretty well takes care of my list. One other question: I take it from your comments that the rendezvous self test, we never did get any good, valid data from that, is that affirmative?
052:16:19 Scott: Not consistent, no. Occasionally, one time we got the range to come into the computer and three or fours times maybe for range rate; but from the computer ten times we got nothing.
052:16:34 McDivitt: It wasn't anything we could pin it down to.
052:16:37 Roosa: Okay, copy that and just as a last items I would like to alert you I'll be calling you again right after SPS fire that we want to initiate a charge on battery B.
052:16:51 Unidentifiable crewmember: Okay.
052:16:52 Roosa: And that's all I have. We are going to have you here for about another minute and a half and then we will see you - We can talk through the Huntsville about 25; if not, Hawaii at 35. [Long pause]
052:17:46 Roosa: Okay, we speak sayanora at Carnarvon, Apollo 9 and we would just like to have you take a look at the middle gimbal.
052:17:55 McDivitt: We'll watch it.
052:17:56 Roosa: Okay, we are too.
052:18:00 McDivitt: Seems like we are getting some disturbance torque as we go around.
052:18:05 Roosa: Roger, copy.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control 52 hours 18 minutes. Huntsville will acquire 52 hours 24 minutes. We will come back up then.
052:18:23 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, I go back and get it going the other way? I'm down here, down this way? It's going this way!
052:18:31 Scott (onboard): I should have called you up and accused you of firing the thrusters, but I knew you weren't.
052:18:48 Scott (onboard): Oh boy, that stuff's really terrible.
052:18:49 Schweickart (onboard): What's that?
052:18:50 Scott (onboard): Chicken with vegetables.
052:18:52 Schweickart (onboard): I had that last night; I thought it was pretty good.
052:18:55 Scott (onboard): I bet!
052:19:00 Scott (onboard): (Laughter) When you guys (laughter) started to get ready for the burn, I realized you were going to go backwards, so I had to run around here and get everything that wasn't settled to go plus X, and fix it to go minus X.
052:19:14 Scott (onboard): Hey, there isn't hardly any storage here at all.
052:19:16 McDivitt (onboard): No.
052:19:18 Scott (onboard): I was disappointed. I braced myself against the panel.
052:19:25 Schweickart (onboard): That's a pretty good burn, you know it?
052:19:27 McDivitt (onboard): Right.
052:19:28 Scott (onboard): [Garble] 6 or 8 minutes of it.
052:19:30 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, but I mean it was - it was well-guided, much better than in the simulator.
052:19:34 McDivitt (onboard): Yes.
052:19:35 Schweickart (onboard): Gosh! It's hard to believe - hardly ...
052:19:36 McDivitt (onboard): Here.
052:19:37 Scott (onboard): Oh, here, let me cut it for you.
052:19:38 Schweickart (onboard): ... hardly any excursions and - looked pretty good.
052:19:55 McDivitt (onboard): We've got to figure out some way of getting this dirt out of here.
052:19:58 Scott (onboard): Boy, you're not kidding.
052:20:00 McDivitt (onboard): I got a piece in my eye a little while ago. I got a piece of hair in my mouth.
052:20:43 Schweickart (onboard): You want to close it?
052:20:45 Schweickart (onboard): Thought I'd caught you.
052:20:55 McDivitt (onboard): Is the hand controller on?
052:20:56 Schweickart (onboard): Sir?
052:20:57 McDivitt (onboard): Is the hand controller on?
052:21:00 Scott (onboard): What I'm going to do next time is to set that 50-degree deadband around zero, and let it do it. It's just not working.
052:21:07 McDivitt (onboard): Yes.
052:21:08 Scott (onboard): Chase, chase, chase. And I bet I've spent more gas chasing it ...
052:21:13 McDivitt (onboard): Yes.
052:21:14 Schweickart (onboard): Than letting it deadband.
052:21:19 McDivitt (onboard): You're darned right.
052:21:29 Scott (onboard): What do we have to do during the alignment?
052:21:32 Schweickart (onboard): Next night pass.
052:21:42 Scott (onboard): I'd like to get some cold water one of these [garble].
052:21:44 Schweickart (onboard): Pardon me.
052:21:55 Schweickart (onboard): That's quite true of spaghetti. You know, I dream about oxygen. Black ox ...
052:22:01 Scott (onboard): Lots of croutons, huh?
052:22:11 McDivitt (onboard): If you'll hand it over this way, Rusty, I'll get it.
052:22:46 Scott (onboard): Hand it up here, and I'll squeeze it.
052:24:28 McDivitt (onboard): Are we on our way out of that gimbal-lock area now?
052:24:31 Scott (onboard): Yes, I think so, because -
052:24:53 Schweickart (onboard): I'm sure I can't see it now.
052:24:54 Scott (onboard): Okay.
052:24:55 Schweickart (onboard): I think we're awfully close.
052:24:59 Scott (onboard): Here you go, Rusty.
This is Apollo Control. 52 hours, 24 minutes, Huntsville about to acquire Apollo 9. We'll stand by.
052:25:09 McDivitt (onboard): Can I take a drink?
052:25:10 Schweickart (onboard): Yes.
052:25:15 Schweickart (onboard): Probably going out the other side.
052:25:17 McDivitt (onboard): No, it's not - it's in the same place; it went back in.
052:26:02 McDivitt (onboard): You don't suppose there's some magnetic anomaly?
052:26:06 Schweickart (onboard): Turning itself - The turning is along the flight path, and it's - The ball aligns.
052:26:13 McDivitt (onboard): (Laughter)
052:26:42 Scott (onboard): That stuff doesn't dissolve.
052:26:44 Schweickart (onboard): You got to squeeze it.
052:26:46 Scott (onboard): I just did [garble] I didn't see much meat in it.
052:27:02 Scott (onboard): Oh boy, is it going to feel good to get that suit off tonight!
052:28:24 Schweickart (onboard): Sounded like the TV was good.
052:29:03 Scott (onboard): Hey, Jim, tell you what. Tell me where that water stuff is, if you've got time.
052:29:13 McDivitt (onboard): Well, one fitting - Dave, it's a fitting about this long, with the QD on one side and the screw-in on the other.
052:29:19 Scott (onboard): Okay.
052:29:20 McDivitt (onboard): Well, right up on the top end.
052:29:23 Scott (onboard): Okay.
052:29:38 McDivitt (onboard): In that little box, where Rusty's sitting.
052:29:40 Scott (onboard): Yes, I know - I know where you mean.
052:30:01 McDivitt (onboard): You see it?
052:30:02 Scott (onboard): Not yet.
052:30:03 McDivitt (onboard): Alright.
052:30:04 Scott (onboard): Okay.
052:30:07 McDivitt (onboard): Now you want to get the toolkit out.
052:30:09 Scott (onboard): (Cough)
052:30:12 McDivitt (onboard): You know where that is?
052:30:13 Scott (onboard): Yes. I'm going to take Rick Nigel's job when I get back. (Coughing)
This is Apollo Control at 52 hours, 30 minutes. Apollo 9 beyond range of the Huntsville now. Went through that pass without any conversation at all. Hawaii will acquire at 52 hours, 34 and one-half minutes - about 3 and one-half minutes from now. We'll come back up then.
052:30:33 Scott (onboard): We want - which one?
052:30:35 McDivitt (onboard): Take the whole toolkit.
052:30:46 Scott (onboard): You want the one to - you want that - (coughing)
052:30:56 McDivitt (onboard): You want to cap it.
052:31:00 Schweickart (onboard): Here's the [garble], Dave. Where do you want that?
052:31:22 Scott (onboard): Now I'll get tool E.
052:31:25 McDivitt (onboard): There was one right over here.
052:31:28 Scott (onboard): Okay.
052:31:30 Schweickart (onboard): Really? There's only one? No, I got the one that you gave me this morning. There's only one, isn't there?
052:31:35 McDivitt (onboard): No, I had the other one out and had it right over here, just for Dave.
052:31:39 Schweickart (onboard): B or E? The screwdriver?
052:31:41 McDivitt (onboard): Oh, E.
052:31:58 Scott (onboard): Okay -
052:32:02 Schweickart (onboard): That son of a buck doesn't want to get out of gimbal lock.
052:32:11 Schweickart (onboard): Very slowly.
052:32:16 McDivitt (onboard): I had it very slowly going out, too, and then it started slowly going back in.
052:32:19 Schweickart (onboard): I think we're trimming - along the flightpath.
052:32:32 McDivitt (onboard): Oh, oh!
052:32:34 Schweickart (onboard): Don't lose it! Did you lose it?
052:32:36 McDivitt (onboard): No, I got it. I wonder what happened to the wire? We capped it.
052:32:39 Schweickart (onboard): It was?
052:32:40 McDivitt (onboard): Right. It's not anymore. Lots of wire down there, but it doesn't do any good.
052:32:50 Scott (onboard): Okay, give me that fitting.
052:33:09 Scott (onboard): There's a lot of hose.
052:33:29 Scott (onboard): Which end would you like?
052:33:31 McDivitt (onboard): I want the -
052:33:35 Scott (onboard): That's the wrong end.
052:33:36 McDivitt (onboard): I know. There should he a filter on that end down there, Dave.
052:33:38 Scott (onboard): I put the filter away this morning.
052:34:06 Schweickart (onboard): Oh, okay, plus it right in the - urine, huh?
052:34:12 McDivitt (onboard): Yes. You got that thing going right over you.
052:34:17 Schweickart (onboard): Well, gee, that's just a little black hose. It doesn't even compete with the other ones. Okay, now you have it rolling down the back of your suit. I'll get out of the way and [garble] now.
052:34:32 Scott (onboard): (Cough)
This is Apollo Control 52 hours 34 minutes. We are about to acquire at Hawaii. We have a report here on medication taken by the crew to date in this mission. All three astronauts have used Afrin spray to relieve stuffiness in their nose caused by the oxygen environment. The lunar module pilot, Rusty Schweickart, has taken two Marezine tablets on day one, he has had one Seconal on day one, that's a sleeping pill, a Seconal on day two, and on day three, he has had a Lomatil. The other two have had no medication other than the Afrin spray. We have acquired at Hawaii. We will stand by live starting with Hawaii and going through the States.
HAWAII (REV 33)
052:35:56 Roosa: Apollo 9, this is Houston. We've got you through Hawaii. Standing by, eyeing the old gimbal.
052:36:04 Scott: Roger. We're dumping the water.
052:36:07 Roosa: Roger. [Pause]
052:36:13 Scott: You know, we've been sitting watching this gimbal, too, and I've been chasing the thing all day long. It seems to seek the red bullet - the red dot in the center of this thing, and I wonder if we are not trimming along the flight path angle. What would you say to that?
052:36:34 Roosa: By jove, I believe that requires some heavy concentration on our part.
052:36:39 Scott: Well, it will give you something to do tonight.
052:36:47 Roosa: What you are trying to say is, you are being stabilized with the gravity gradient, then?
052:36:54 Scott: I guess I don't really know what I'm saying, is the reason why. I don't really understand it, but it seems to seek the in-planeness, even when you get it sort of moving away from the gimbal lock area, it stops and starts to move back unless you have enough rate. If you have enough rate to move away permanently, it will swing around to the other side.
052:37:20 Roosa: By jove, that's a real good observation. How about vertically? Is it trying to align itself vertically too, along the gravity gradient?
052:37:29 Scott: No, I don't think so. I haven't noticed that so much, just seems in any roll orientation, it seems to want to go to the in-planeness. I guess maybe we can watch the vertical alignment tomorrow to see if it is gravity gradient.
052:37:46 Roosa: Okay. I've got another question for you, Dave? Did you get any alarms during the day from the tyro tanks?
052:37:53 Scott: No, not a one. Not until you called. That was the first one.
052:37:56 Roosa: Okay, thank you. [Long pause]
052:38:23 Scott: Hey, Smoky?
052:38:26 Roosa: Go ahead.
052:38:28 Scott: You know, now that I think about it, I guess maybe 70 - 80 percent of the time today, I've been able to see the horizon out of the hatch window.
052:38:44 Roosa: Roger.
052:38:46 Scott: Which sort of means maybe it is pulled by grav.
052:38:54 Roosa: My goodness. Maybe we've come up with something here that will become an international law or something, you know, like F = MA.
052:39:04 Scott: Say, now. Wouldn't that be something?
052:39:06 Roosa: Tremendous.
Very long comm break.
GOLDSTONE (REV 33)
052:51:28 Roosa: Gumdrops Houston.
052:51:30 Scott: Go ahead Houston.
052:51:32 Roosa: Roger. We'd like to have P00 and ACCEPT please. We have a state vector and a target load for you, and you might start fumbling for a maneuver pad; I'll have one for you when you're ready to copy on this SPS-5. [Pause]
052:51:48 Scott: Roger. You have P00 and ACCEPT and we are ready to copy.
052:51:56 Roosa: Okay. I'll be ready in about one minute. [Long pause]
052:52:20 Roosa: Okay, Gumdrop, this is Houston with the PAD.
052:52:27 Scott: Go.
052:52:28 Roosa: Roger. Reading SPS-5: 054 26 1120, minus 02109, minus 03775, plus 03796 05754 05673 0432 30545, plus 110, minus 080 25 17610 28 800, minus 0388, plus 13076 1769. And I'd like to pass the LM weight - is 21860. [Pause]
052:54:22 Scott: Roger. Can you give me the shaft angle again, please?
052:54:26 Roosa: Roger. Reading the shaft angle: 17610. And under remarks, I have your gimbal angles that will give you 90 degrees out of plane in case of the early shut down. Reading: roll, all zips; pitch, 040; yaw 030. End of update. [Pause]
052:55:11 Scott: Roger. Stand by just one on the readback.
052:55:15 Roosa: Roger. Standing by for the readback, and the computer is yours. You have been loaded a state vector and a target load. [Long pause]
052:55:36 Scott: Okay, Smoky. Do you have a preferred time on those angles? I realize that they are out of plane all the time, but do you have a preferred time or anything on them?
052:55:48 Roosa: That's negative; just under the [garble] in all the ground rules that we had; just as soon as possible, once you determined the cause and feel like kicking it off again.
052:56:02 Scott: Okay, here comes the readback: 054 26 1120, minus 02109, minus 03775, plus 03796 05754 05673 0432 3054 - oops, excuse me - 30545, plus 110, minus 080 25 17610 28 800, minus 0388, plus 13076 1769. And understand roll 0, pitch 40, yaw 30; we're 90 out of plane, LM weight 21860.
052:57:04 Roosa: Roger. Houston confirms the update. It looks good.
052:57:08 Scott: Thank you.
Very long comm break.
053:06:20 Schweickart (onboard): Lo and behold, you're going to be [garble] going to the John, Dave.
053:06:27 McDivitt (onboard): Hmm, let me set the control for you.
053:06:47 McDivitt (onboard): What were those gimbal angles again, Rusty?
053:06:52 McDivitt (onboard): What?
053:07:05 Scott (onboard): Did it go up?
053:07:34 Scott (onboard): You're all set [garble].
053:08:07 McDivitt (onboard): Would you shut off the vent, Dave? It feels cold. It feels like [garble].
053:08:11 Scott (onboard): Yes.
053:08:31 Scott (onboard): Well. I wonder why [garble].
053:08:38 McDivitt (onboard): It looks like there's a big bag on there, doesn't it?
053:08:39 Scott (onboard): Yes, I know.
Spacecraft has just moved out of the range of Antigua tracking station. We've had a shift change here at Mission Control Center in Houston. The Gold Team now has replaced the white and let me pass on an administrative announcement for the news media representatives who are watching - covering the flight. We anticipate the change of shift briefing will be between 3:15 and 3:30 CST. On this upcoming pass, the major item of action as far as we're concerned is the SPS-5 burn which should take place approximately at 54 hours and 25 minutes, while the spacecraft is acquired by the tracking stations at Goldstone, California, and Corpus Christi. During the burn, the crew will be shooting for a velocity vector or DELTA V of about 575 feet per second. Duration of the burn is 43.2 seconds and the maneuver is designed to put the spacecraft into a circular orbit. It's the final shaping really for the LM-CSM exercise which is scheduled for day No. 5 in this Apollo 9 flight. If the burn is normal, we expect the new spacecraft altitudes to be 129.9 by 129.8 nautical miles. Before the crew fires that SPS engine on the CSM, they will light up the RCS thrusters for a ullage burn, this required prior to ignition to settle the propellants. During earlier SPS maneuvers, the tanks were full and therefore no settling was necessary, but as you get more empty space, you have to relocate those weightless propellants to a position where they can feed the engines. Four RCS thrusters will be used for ullage and we estimate the firing time for that exercise will be about 18 seconds. At 53 hours, 10 minutes, ground elapsed time, with spacecraft heading over the Atlantic Ocean, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control. We have reacquired the spacecraft at the Ascension Island tracking station and we'll stand by to monitor any conversation between Astronaut Stuart Roosa, who is the CAPCOM here in Houston, and the crew of Apollo 9. We'll stand by.
ASCENSION (REV 34)
053:12:41 Roosa: Gumdrop, this is Houston through Ascension. Standing by.
053:12:46 McDivitt: Roger, Houston. This is Apollo 9 here.
053:12:50 Roosa: Roger, Apollo 9.
053:12:56 Unidentifiable crewmember: We're just getting ready to start the P52.
053:12:59 Roosa: Roger, copy.
Long comm break.
We're standing by here monitoring the pass of Apollo 9 as it passes within range of the Ascension tracking station. We'll continue to monitor the loop for any conversation between the ground here and the crew.
053:17:51 Roosa: And we followed that, Apollo 9. [Pause]
053:17:58 McDivitt: Oh, very well, thank you.
053:18:00 Roosa: Roger.
Very long comm break.
During this portion of the pass the program 52, the inertial measurement unit realignment, was accomplished. The spacecraft still is within range of the Ascension Island tracking station. We'll have it for about another minute before it moves out of range, next to be picked up by the station at Tananarive.
053:21:06 Scott (onboard): Yes. Yes. 25 degrees. 20 or [garble].
053:21:48 Schweickart (onboard): Hardly any [garble].
053:21:51 Scott (onboard): Really?
053:21:53 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble]. What did you say about 25 degrees, Dave?
053:22:04 Scott (onboard): Well, folks, we might not get the attitude in time to get a star check for the burn.
053:22:08 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, I - I see that. If you could do it [garble].
053:22:15 Scott (onboard): [Garble] do a good job here.
053:22:24 McDivitt (onboard): I'm not sure [garble] on this deal.
053:22:42 McDivitt (onboard): I get [garble].
053:22:45 Scott (onboard): Yes.
We have lost signal from the Apollo 9 through the Ascension tracking station. We would expect to pick up the spacecraft at Tananarive at 53 hours, 28 minutes, or about 6 more minutes from now. At 53 hours, 22 minutes into the flight of Apollo 9, this is Apollo Control.
053:22:47 McDivitt (onboard): Even though it [garble].
053:22:58 Scott (onboard): [Garble] sleepy [garble] stop.
053:23:10 Scott (onboard): [Garble]. What do you want to do with these?
053:23:12 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble].
053:23:13 Scott (onboard): No.
053:23:21 Scott (onboard): Yes, that - that's silly.
053:23:25 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, [garble].
053:23:54 McDivitt (onboard): Yes, we should be coming on [garble] a star like this one.
053:23:58 Scott (onboard): Yes, I've got the Big Dipper again.
053:24:03 Schweickart (onboard): Right where we started. [Garble] than this, Jim.
053:24:13 McDivitt (onboard): No, I'm not; but if we just get the [garble], I think we're going to get a lot more stars in the [garble].
053:24:17 Schweickart (onboard): Oh, okay.
053:24:22 Scott (onboard): Yes, okay, I see [garble].
053:24:45 McDivitt (onboard): There's a couple of big [garble] not too many.
053:25:08 Scott (onboard): Seems the Apollo [garble] won't roll.
053:25:50 Scott (onboard): Who put this on starboard? [Garble] a light come on for that.
053:25:54 McDivitt (onboard): Oh! (Laughter) That's Dave.
053:26:00 Schweickart (onboard): No, I didn't think that [garble] would do it.
053:26:38 Scott (onboard): Shit, [garble] right to it.
053:28:37 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble].
053:28:39 McDivitt (onboard): You that far?
053:28:40 Schweickart (onboard): Yes. You don't think we can do it, Dave?
053:28:43 Scott (onboard): No, [garble].
053:28:46 Scott (onboard): Yes, that's what I've been doing [garble] Flight Plan.
053:28:53 McDivitt (onboard): Yes. It is, too.
053:28:55 Scott (onboard): You're right, Jim.
053:29:00 Schweickart (onboard): Well, that [garble] was planned.
053:29:03 McDivitt (onboard): Let it stay down here for this time. [Garble] I come back up here.
053:29:13 McDivitt (onboard): Dave, you want to change my hoses over to the right side?
053:29:15 Scott (onboard): Okay. Come here. [Garble]. You want all these helmets and gloves off?
053:29:24 McDivitt (onboard): Yes.
053:29:32 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble] on this thing.
053:29:55 Schweickart (onboard): You want - you want to try to make a third star check when we get there, Jim?
053:29:58 McDivitt (onboard): Go ahead.
053:30:02 Scott (onboard): You [garble] stars in here [garble] alright, Rusty.
053:30:04 Schweickart (onboard): Yes? You want to use their star check? We've never had one yet. Oh, I'll try. If we have to [garble] up there, I'll try it.
053:30:53 Schweickart (onboard): Alright, let's see.
053:30:56 McDivitt (onboard): I don't want to put a light on it [garble].
053:31:00 Schweickart (onboard): I ought to go back up and wrap around.
053:31:03 McDivitt (onboard): I know.
053:31:04 Scott (onboard): Make sure it's alright, Jim.
053:31:05 McDivitt (onboard): Hey, how do you like that?
053:31:07 Scott (onboard): Rusty's...
053:31:13 McDivitt (onboard): Turn that thing off. [Garble]. Okay?
053:31:15 Schweickart (onboard): Hey, I got - I'll do my COMM, too.
053:31:19 Scott (onboard): Okay.
053:32:39 Schweickart (onboard): Hey, you got my air [garble], Dave?
053:32:47 Scott (onboard): Yes.
TANANARIVE (REV 34)
053:35:05 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston through Tananarive. [Pause]
053:35:09 McDivitt (onboard): Hello, Houston; Apollo 9. Hello, Houston; you read Apollo 9?
053:36:07 McDivitt (onboard): Where's my helmet? Is that it down there?
053:36:10 Scott (onboard): [Garble].
053:36:22 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble] that silly gravel out there, Jim.
053:36:25 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, Houston. We will see you over Carnarvon at 44. [Pause]
053:36:30 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, Houston; Apollo 9.
053:38:26 Schweickart (onboard): Oh, you've got that strut there now.
053:38:35 McDivitt (onboard): I think we could probably take that strut down. Dave, we're not using that [garble], are we?
053:38:45 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble] Dave have to leave it there.
053:38:48 McDivitt (onboard): (Laughter) We're not using that support strut any more, are we?
053:38:52 Schweickart (onboard): That's okay; it's not in my way.
053:38:55 McDivitt (onboard): Are you getting around here?
053:38:56 Schweickart (onboard): Okay.
053:38:58 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
053:38:59 Schweickart (onboard): It's alright.
053:39:05 McDivitt (onboard): It's alright, Dave.
053:39:56 McDivitt (onboard): What?
053:42:33 Schweickart (onboard): Ohh!
053:43:18 McDivitt (onboard): (Yawn)
CARNARVON (REV 34)
053:48:30 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston, we have you through Carnarvon.
053:48:34 McDivitt: Hello there, Houston, Apollo 9.
053:48:37 Roosa: Roger loud and clear.
053:48:40 McDivitt: Roger. Same with you. We are over Hawaii drifting slowly over towards deep burn attitude. [Pause]
053:48:51 Roosa: Houston, roger. [Pause]
053:48:59 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. You are go for SPS-5.
053:49:02 McDivitt: Roger. Go for SPS-5.
Very long comm break.
053:53:37 Scott (onboard): Bypass the - RESTART routine, and exit the program. Okay?
053:53:40 Schweickart (onboard): Okay.
053:53:41 Scott (onboard): Your input's 47? You [garble] a DELTA-V [garble] minus Y [garble] put a time in [garble]. Is the meter on?
053:53:54 Scott (onboard): There's no light.
053:53:56 McDivitt (onboard): Yes, yaw is 30 degrees.
053:53:59 Scott (onboard): [Garble].
053:54:00 McDivitt (onboard): Yes, we're going [garble] that [garble] should be going backwards, turning to the north with - down. Not this way. So, what we'll do is we'll just come up and yaw. Okay?
053:54:17 Scott (onboard): Roll right.
053:54:19 McDivitt (onboard): Roll right.
053:54:25 McDivitt (onboard): What?
053:54:29 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
053:54:38 Scott (onboard): But I would think you'd probably want to [garble].
053:54:42 McDivitt (onboard): At 4 or 5 feet per second [garble].
053:54:48 McDivitt (onboard): All we're trying to do is satisfy the DELTA-V for the [garble].
053:54:51 Scott (onboard): Okay.
053:54:52 McDivitt (onboard): Then you have to go back and retarget it for the -
053:54:57 Scott (onboard): Yes, you know that - that was almost three times the [garble] and one time, it's four times as [garble].
053:55:19 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble].
053:56:07 McDivitt (onboard): You want to take this [garble] down, or can you read it okay? [Garble].
053:56:28 McDivitt (onboard): Have any trouble with your head yesterday? Your head - holding it up?
053:56:32 Scott (onboard): With my head?
053:56:33 McDivitt (onboard): Holding it up during the burn?
053:57:04 McDivitt (onboard): You're going to do what?
053:57:05 Schweickart (onboard): Trying to see if I can [garble].
053:57:07 Scott (onboard): What if you can't?
053:57:29 McDivitt (onboard): Burgie hasn't seemed to be much help to us on this, has he? (Laughter)
053:57:33 Schweickart (onboard): Who?
053:57:34 McDivitt (onboard): Burgie.
GUAM (REV 34)
053:59:49 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Guam. Standing by.
053:59:53 McDivitt: Hello there, Houston, through Guam. How are you today?
053:59:56 Evans: Roger. Good shape.
054:00:00 McDivitt: It is nice to talk to you in the day time. You keep waking me up in the morning.
054:00:05 Evans: It's better for me too.
054:00:12 McDivitt: I guess somebody must be getting easy on you down there, right?
054:00:17 Evans: 9, Houston, say again.
054:00:20 McDivitt: Roger. Whoever is doing the scheduling must be getting easy on you.
054:00:27 Evans: Yea concur.
Comm break.
054:01:51 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9. We just completed our daylight star check, and low and behold, a star was there.
054:01:58 Evans: Hey great.
Comm break.
054:04:38 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. One minute LOS, Hawaii at 12.
054:04:44 McDivitt: Roger, Hawaii at 12. Oky-doky. [Long pause]
054:05:03 McDivitt: Hey, Ron, is Sonny there with you?
054:05:08 Evans: Is who with me?
054:05:10 McDivitt: Oh, never mind. I'll get you over Hawaii.
054:05:12 Evans: Roger.
054:05:15 Evans: Smokey is still here.
054:05:19 McDivitt: No, Sonny, Sonny Morton.
054:05:23 Evans: Yea. He's here too.
054:05:25 McDivitt: Okay.
054:05:28 Scott (onboard): (Laughter) You dirty rat, McDivitt ...
054:05:30 Evans: Hello Jimmy.
Long comm break.
054:05:31 Scott (onboard): Oh, boy. Oh, (laughter) ye gods!
054:06:14 Scott (onboard): How much time we got, Jim?
054:06:16 McDivitt (onboard): 20 minutes.
054:06:17 Scott (onboard): Be right here.
054:06:18 McDivitt (onboard): I think - I think this thing is trimming, you know that? [Garble] although they still say zero.
054:07:08 Schweickart (onboard): I'll try a [garble].
054:07:19 Scott (onboard): Okay, how many feet, for sure?
054:08:58 McDivitt (onboard): (Laughter) What you doing down there?
054:09:36 McDivitt (onboard): Boy, that DELTA-V counter is really drifting.
054:09:41 Scott (onboard): Did you get it set?
054:09:43 McDivitt (onboard): No.
054:09:45 Scott (onboard): 5 - 7.3.
054:09:47 Schweickart (onboard): 7.3.
054:10:16 Schweickart (onboard): How low are we supposed to let the cryos go?
054:10:24 Schweickart (onboard): We did?
054:10:26 McDivitt (onboard): The fans are supposed to be ON now?
054:10:37 Scott (onboard): No. You want the fans OFF - both?
054:10:53 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble] reading 700.
054:11:20 Scott (onboard): Want me to do the reading this time, Rusty?
054:11:23 Schweickart (onboard): No, I'm - I'm okay.
054:11:24 Scott (onboard): Okay. It may be better to do something.
054:11:27 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, oh yes, I think it would be.
054:11:30 McDivitt (onboard): Boy, that rendezvous Window is really getting clouded up, isn't it?
This is Apollo Control at 54 hours 11 minutes into the flight of Apollo 9. During the recent change of shift press conference we recorded some of the conversation that took place, although it was somewhat limited over Tananarive, Carnarvon, and the station at Guam. Spacecraft at the present time is approaching Hawaii. We have a new, also we have a new capcom on at this time it is astronaut Ron Evans. We are prepared to play that conversation between the ground and the crew back to you at this time.
Well we've been acquired by the Hawaii station and at this time we are about a quarter of an hour and 15 minutes still from the burn. The SPS-5 burn. As you heard in the conversation, in addition to Ron Evans, astronaut Al Warden and Pete Conrad now both came into the Mission Control Center here. In that SPS-5 burn again those important objectives of course, will be an ullage manuver to settle the propellants and the burn itself for some 43.2 seconds, Delta-V of 575 feet per second as planned, and this should result in a circular orbit of about 129.9 by 129.8 nautical miles. Meantime let's monitor some more of the conversation between the ground here and the crew.
054:11:38 Scott (onboard): I think the windows are doing pretty damn well!
054:11:40 Schweickart (onboard): Well, I do, too.
054:11:41 McDivitt (onboard): All of them except the rendezvous window.
054:11:43 Schweickart (onboard): Mine is doing great over here. There's not any on it at all.
054:11:47 McDivitt (onboard): I didn't even get a chance to look at this - that sight. I looked up there at one time to see if it was [garble] and it was, and then I tried to put the COAS up for you.
054:11:54 Schweickart (onboard): Yes.
054:11:55 Scott (onboard): I turned it on for you a couple of times, but you couldn't get me.
054:11:58 Schweickart (onboard): Yes?
054:11:59 Scott (onboard): It works.
054:12:04 McDivitt (onboard): I think I found out at one time that [garble].
054:12:06 Scott (onboard): Yes. I seem to recall it. Had your curtain drawn at night, didn't you?
054:12:12 McDivitt (onboard): Huh?
054:12:13 Scott (onboard): You had your upper curtain drawn.
054:12:15 McDivitt (onboard): Oh, yes.
054:12:18 Scott (onboard): Hey, did - did you start up the glyc - the evaporator this morning, or not?
054:12:21 McDivitt (onboard): No, huh uh, no.
054:12:25 Scott (onboard): Take it or leave it.
054:12:27 McDivitt (onboard): Leave it go.
HAWAII (REV 34)
054:13:49 Evans: Apollo 9 Houston through Hawaii, standing by.
054:13:53 McDivitt: Roger.
054:13:54 Evans: Roger.
Comm break.
054:15:54 Evans: Apollo 9 Houston. I'll give you a mark on 10 minutes.
054:15:57 McDivitt: Roger. [Long pause]
054:16:12 Evans: Mark.
054:16:13 Evans: 10 minutes.
054:16:14 McDivitt: Roger we're right together.
Very long comm break.
According to our information here we've had loss of signal at the Hawaii station. We should be up again at the Redstone at 54 hours 19 minutes. That is in about a minute. At 54 hours 18 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 54 hours, 19 minutes into the flight. We expect acquisition by the tracking ship Redstone in a few more seconds. At the present time the spacecraft apogee is 270 nautical miles and its perigee is 109. We want to move from that orbital altitude to a circular and we hope to do so on the SPS-5. Meantime, we'll stand by and monitor any conversation between the Capcom here in Houston and the flight crew.
We would anticipate that the crew is kind of busy at the present time, and therefore we may not have much conversation. We'll continue to stand by.
According to our clock here, we're less than five minutes from ignition.
On my mark, 4 minutes from ignition. Mark.
Three minutes from ignition, SPS-5 ignition, three minutes. At this time the flight controllers here all report systems looking good on spacecraft.
We are now less than two minutes from the SPS-5 burn.
On my mark, one minute from ignition. Mark. One minute from SPS-5 burn.
054:25:39 Scott (onboard): EMS, OFF.
054:25:41 McDivitt (onboard): OFF.
Thirty seconds. All systems still appear to be functioning normally.
054:25:45 Scott (onboard): [Garble] my watch.
054:25:55 McDivitt (onboard): How we doing?
054:25:56 Scott (onboard): Okay. Hold on back there. Brace your head.
054:26:01 Scott (onboard): Average g is working.
Ten seconds and we have a report of ullage.
054:26:04 Schweickart (onboard): 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, proceed, 2, 1 -
054:26:13 Schweickart (onboard): IGNITION. 3 is ON.
We have a report of ignition.
054:26:17 McDivitt (onboard): Okay - It opened all the way.
054:26:19 Schweickart (onboard): Okay.
054:26:22 Scott (onboard): 35 seconds. Okay. Looks good. DSKY and the EMS agree.
054:26:28 Scott (onboard): 25 seconds to go. I think the entire DSKY and EMS are good.
054:26:32 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble] clock.
054:26:34 Schweickart (onboard): The clock - if it stops, you're okay.
054:26:36 Scott (onboard): 20 seconds. DSKY and EMS are good.
Flight control has the report that the burn is good so far -- at 26 seconds.
054:26:41 McDivitt (onboard): DSKY's [garble].
054:26:42 Scott (onboard): 15.
054:26:43 McDivitt (onboard): It's coming back. It might knock it out.
054:26:47 Scott (onboard): 10.
Another report, burn is looking good.
054:26:48 McDivitt (onboard): Time agrees.
054:26:49 Scott (onboard): Okay.
054:26:51 Scott (onboard): 5.
054:26:57 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, they all closed.
054:26:59 Scott (onboard): Okay, get the breakers in. Okay, then GIMBAL MOTORS OFF, one at a time.
And the flight control has report cut-off. From the report it looks like a good burn.
054:27:04 McDivitt (onboard): 1, 2, 3, 4.
054:27:08 Scott (onboard): Okay, verified. TVC SERVO POWER 1 and 2, OFF.
The onboard computer on the spacecraft reports that the [garble] now, let's stand by.
054:27:12 McDivitt (onboard): Two, OFF.
054:27:13 Scott (onboard): ATT DEADBAND, MAX.
054:27:14 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, DEADBAND, MAX.
054:27:15 Scott (onboard): RATE, HIGH.
054:27:16 McDivitt (onboard): RATE, HIGH.
054:27:17 Scott (onboard): SPACECRAFT CONTROL, SCS.
054:27:18 McDivitt (onboard): SCS. That thing is really pulsing. Would you say -
REDSTONE (REV 34)
054:27:20 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
054:27:21 Evans: Houston. Roger. We copy your residuals. Request Delta-VC.
054:27:25 Scott: Roger. Delta-VC is 9.9.
054:27:30 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
The onboard computer reported an apogee of 129 and a perigee of 123 nautical miles. We'll refine those later. In the meantime we'll stand by for more conversation.
FIDO reports the whole burn looked good. Solid as a rock.
054:28:20 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9. Did you copy our HA and HP?
054:28:27 Evans: Roger. We copy. 129.6; 127.7.
054:28:31 Schweickart: Okay.
054:28:33 McDivitt: Hey, that was a pretty burn.
054:28:36 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
054:29:03 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Request the BATT B charging, as soon as you get to it.
054:29:08 Scott: Roger. In work.
054:29:09 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
Little earlier there was a report of residuals.
054:29:45 Scott: Okay. BATT B on charge, Houston, and we're drawing 2 and one quarter amps on it.
054:29:52 Evans: 9, Houston. Roger. We copy. [Long pause]
Those residuals are those refined feet per second DELTA Velocities that the SPS burn didn't quite achieve. They could be a little bit short or they could be a little long. The crew will burn out the exact number using the RCS thrusters.
054:30:33 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
054:30:35 Scott: Go ahead.
054:30:36 Evans: Roger. We'll be going private over Antigua in about 35.
054:30:41 McDivitt: Okay [garble].
Comm break.
054:32:42 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
054:32:44 McDivitt: Go Houston, Apollo 9.
054:32:45 Evans: Roger, We see you are in Program 6 right now. Just be advised we want to give you your state vector before you power down.
054:32:52 McDivitt: Oh, gracious.
054:32:56 Scott: Roger. We'll bring the CMC back on the line.
054:32:59 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
054:33:04 McDivitt: You're pretty fast. [Pause]
054:33:11 McDivitt: When it gets close to time to rest, we're really in motion.
054:33:17 Evans: Say again.
054:33:19 McDivitt: I said when it gets close to time for - for the time for us to start resting, we really get in motion.
054:33:24 Evans: I noticed that.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control here in Houston. As you know, we've had a request from the crew for a private conversation, and we are prepared to take this line down at 35. That's 54 hours and 35 minutes or some, about 35 or 40 seconds from now, and then we'll come back up as soon as possible. At 54 hours, 35 minutes this is Apollo Control.
054:38:48 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble]. You go ahead.
054:38:50 Schweickart: Deke, this is Rusty. I'm not sure that it's not a combination of things, but I think it is related to motion also. And unless I can get some food in me, and keep it in me, I'm not going to be feeling much better. Now, I'm planning to try and eat up a stor[garble] tonight, but, in all frankness, I sure won't have much appetite.
054:39:13 Slayton: Well, the Marezine doesn't help you much, huh?
054:39:18 Schweickart: Well, it's kind of hard to say. This morning, I took a Marezine before breakfast, and then very shortly after breakfast, it all came back up - in the middle of all that commotion that we were - that we were going through, getting ready to get through that tunnel. I would guess that, under the same circumstances tomorrow morning, it'd probably be very much the same.
054:39:51 Slayton: Roger.
054:39:52 McDivitt: And another thing, Deke, I think we've got to stretch out the - we got to get a little extra time in here. Today I had a bag of fruit salad and a bag of cocoa or something like that for breakfast. About 12 hour later is - I have time to eat. And I think that if - We don't want to attack that rendezvous, which is about an 18-hour day, like that.
054:40:15 Slayton: I couldn't agree more; we'll have to take a look at the book.
054:40:18 McDivitt: I think if we have enough time tomorrow, to prepare the spacecraft pretty good tomorrow night, then we can get up in the morning, and maybe get to bed a little earlier, get up in the morning the next day, and probably make that timeline.
054:40:33 Slayton: Roger. I just wanted to make one comment on this private loop so you all understand it. We are summarizing it down here; it's not being released word by word, but it is being summarized to the press. I don't know if you guys understood that or not, so we don't want you to hold back telling anything you think is appropriate. But you should understand that it is being summarized. It is considered [garble].
054:40:56 McDivitt: Roger; I understand that.
054:40:59 Slayton: And we'd like to express our thanks to you for doing a great job today. It was outstanding.
054:41:05 McDivitt: Well (laughter), we're just up here, trying to do what we've been practicing for a few years. I'll tell you, we sure got a lot of comments on how to operate in the spacecraft with suits on and with three - three great big pairs of hoses. Also, I'll tell you off the record here, [garble] if we're still in private - (cough)
Very long comm break.
054:41:31 Scott (onboard): Yes, we're [garble].
054:41:32 McDivitt (onboard): There's a lot of little things that have to be fixed up (cough) to make this spacecraft really operable inside - like ...
054:41:41 Scott (onboard): I think they're gone, Jim.
054:41:44 McDivitt (onboard): ... like numbering those God-blessed lithium hydroxide cans.
054:41:48 Scott (onboard): Oh, yes.
054:41:49 Schweickart (onboard): And that water ...
054:41:52 McDivitt (onboard): That LM. Nothing's fit for that God-blessed LM, Dave. I - Hey, do you know that - the OPS came - pallet came loose during that burn - (cough) [garble].
054:42:00 Scott (onboard): Did it really?
054:42:02 McDivitt (onboard): Yes, it went floating around when I went back to get it.
054:42:04 Schweickart (onboard): Oh, boy.
054:42:09 McDivitt (onboard): There's not - I bet you there's not 50 percent of the things over there that work.
054:42:23 Scott (onboard): Where are we?
054:42:25 McDivitt (onboard): You know something?
054:42:27 Scott (onboard): Oh shit, no, I didn't [garble].
054:42:32 Schweickart (onboard): I was going to say, boy, that water that I got, chlorinated water, taste [garble] either.
054:42:37 McDivitt (onboard): Hey, this - this is terrible, this water here.
054:42:39 Scott (onboard): We haven't - we haven't chlorinated it yet, have we, today?
054:42:42 Schweickart (onboard): No.
054:42:43 Scott (onboard): Okay, look. Let's get our food before we chlorinate it.
054:42:46 McDivitt (onboard): When are we due to do that stuff, David?
054:42:47 Scott (onboard): I don't know, but, boy, I don't want to eat food with all that crap in it again.
054:42:51 McDivitt (onboard): It'll still have to be chlorinated.
054:42:52 Scott (onboard): But it's not - I've been tasting it - it's not as bad as it was last night. I'll tell you, that - that - that water I had last night burned my mouth when I put it in there.
054:43:07 Scott (onboard): Jim, could you wait just a second? Hey, Jim?
054:43:11 McDivitt (onboard): Yes.
054:43:12 Scott (onboard): Let me get this stuff put back together here before you come down.
054:43:18 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble] right over here [garble].
054:43:35 Scott (onboard): Be with you in just a second, Jim.
054:43:37 Schweickart (onboard): Have you got the AUTO RCS, OFF, Jim?
054:43:40 McDivitt (onboard): AUTO RCS, OFF.

054:45:12 Scott (onboard): Okay, Jim. Done?
054:45:16 Schweickart (onboard): Yes. We supposed to purge tonight? They said anything about it?
054:45:21 Scott (onboard): No, it's - I'll tell you, I would go - Let's see, wish -
054:45:30 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble].
054:45:32 Scott (onboard): Yes. Let's see what the Flight Plan says here.
054:45:41 Schweickart (onboard): 55.
054:45:47 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble].
054:45:50 Schweickart (onboard): So am I. I got some last night. I was coughing last night.
054:46:01 Scott (onboard): [Garble] and go chase it. Yes, take one in the other hand, too, and blow.
054:46:06 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
054:46:12 Schweickart (onboard): You say anything about a purge, Jim or Dave?
054:46:15 McDivitt (onboard): Well, they did say to activate the water, though.
054:46:18 Scott (onboard): No, they never have. And I guess that means do it. I - Let's see, where's our next station pass? Ascension we want at 46. We just had Ascension, didn't we?
054:46:33 Schweickart (onboard): Yes. What's next?
054:46:38 Scott (onboard): Pretoria? 55:05.
054:46:40 Schweickart (onboard): Tananarive.
054:46:43 McDivitt (onboard): Dave, I didn't [garble].
054:46:45 Scott (onboard): Yes.
054:46:49 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, I'll just get the cryo fans.
054:46:54 Scott (onboard): Why don't we ask them what they want when we get there?
054:46:58 Schweickart (onboard): Alright.
054:46:59 Scott (onboard): Let's start eating then. Yes, why don't you just eat, and let's just ask then what they want done with the fan, because they've been different ...
054:47:04 Schweickart (onboard): Now, let me see if there's something else I can do here. Waste water dump; we already did that. WASTE MANAGEMENT OVERBOARD DRAIN, OFF; WASTE STOWAGE VENT, CLOSED; S-BAND, OMNI B; and COMM, basic. Which is A duple - Oh, what are we going to do tonight on the COMM? Could it - Probably [garble] A SIMPLEX, [garble], I guess.
054:47:25 Scott (onboard): Yes, A SIMPLEX.
054:47:26 Schweickart (onboard): EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE to BOTH. Have we got the cabin pressure configured yet?
054:47:31 Scott (onboard): Yes. I been doing that off and on today several times.
054:47:33 Schweickart (onboard): Okay. SURGE TANK, ON. I'm sure it is. PLSS, OFF.
054:47:38 Scott (onboard): I'll check it.
054:47:40 Schweickart (onboard): Yes?
054:47:41 Scott (onboard): Yes.
054:47:42 Schweickart (onboard): LM TUNNEL VENT to LM PRESS.
054:47:44 Scott (onboard): Yes.
054:47:45 Schweickart (onboard): SYSTEMS TEST to 4 Delta.
054:47:48 Scott (onboard): Here it is.
054:47:52 Schweickart (onboard): Onboard readouts to MSFN. Okay, I'll get that stuff. Where's the log, Dave?
054:47:59 Scott (onboard): It's in - The crew log? It's over where you can log them in.
054:48:06 Schweickart (onboard): Oh, yes, that's right.
054:48:09 Scott (onboard): Hey, you know, I found today the 70-millimeter thing - We started on the last page.
054:48:15 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, I know. I took that on the 16-millimeter, didn't I?
054:48:21 Scott (onboard): Yes. Well, it's - I don't know; it's hard to tell those tabs really are meaningful.
054:48:30 Schweickart (onboard): Well, at times, they're -
054:48:34 McDivitt (onboard): You want me to help?
054:48:35 Scott (onboard): Put the time in.
054:48:36 Schweickart (onboard): Oh, okay. 54:48:37.
054:48:54 Schweickart (onboard): You want to give me a service module RCS [garble].
054:48:56 Scott (onboard): Yes. Quad A, 75; B, 76; C, 69; D, 69. Oh, I'm sorry. 74, 74. I'm sorry.
054:49:23 Schweickart (onboard): I was saying: Man, we really ate it out of those today.
054:49:26 Scott (onboard): Yes, pardon me.
054:49:31 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, I need - I need the systems test meter stuff, Jim.
054:49:39 McDivitt (onboard): Coming up.
054:49:40 Scott (onboard): 5 C, D, and which one of those other things?
054:49:56 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble] 5 C and D? [garble]?
054:50:01 Schweickart (onboard): Right.
054:50:02 McDivitt (onboard): Let's see, [garble].
This is Apollo Control at 54 hours, 50 minutes into the mission, FIDO, the Flight Dynamics Officer, gave us a refined figure, some refined figures on our last burn. And our apogee reads at the present time, 129.1 nautical miles, and the perigee is 123.7 nautical miles. The orbital weight of the spacecraft at the present time is 49,486 pounds. We expect the crew to be acquired by the station Ascension momentarily and we'll stand by to monitor any conversation that should transpire between the ground and the crew.
054:50:28 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, thank you.
054:50:37 Schweickart (onboard): Houston, Apollo 9.
054:50:49 McDivitt (onboard): Oh hell.
054:50:52 Schweickart (onboard): We're supposed to be using about 4 percent out of everything - 5 percent out of everything except Bravo. And Bravo we use 8 percent.
054:51:01 Scott (onboard): Yes, we used lots of gas today.
054:51:05 Schweickart (onboard): How are we on our redline?
054:51:06 Scott (onboard): Well, we dropped a little low on it; we lost today. But I'm not surprised with all that damn running in the gimbal lock every 5 minutes.
054:51:16 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble]?
054:51:18 Scott (onboard): Yes.
This pass over Ascension will be a relatively short one, about 2 minutes. We may not get any conversation. Here we are.
ASCENSION (REV 35)
054:51:38 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
054:51:42 Evans: Houston; go.
054:51:47 Scott: Roger. We've got consumable status for you here.
054:51:48 Evans: Roger. We're ready to copy.
054:51:50 Scott: Okay, service module RCS, A, B, C, D. Ready to copy?
054:51:55 Evans: Go.
054:51:56 Scott: 75, 76, 74, 74.
054:52:04 Evans: 75, 76, 74, 74.
054:52:07 Scott: Roger. BAT C, 37.0; PYRO A, 37.1; B, 37.1. [Pause]
054:52:21 Evans: Roger.
054:52:23 Scott: And we've got the command module injector temperatures for you.
054:52:27 Scott: 5 Charlie, off scale high; 5 Delta, 4.85; 6 Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta, all off scale high.
054:52:41 Evans: Roger. All off scale high except 5 Delta and, it's 4.85.
054:52:48 Scott: That's for Charlie. I mean that's affirmative. (Laughter)
054:52:52 Evans: Okay. We show you 129.1 by 123.6. We're refining it, but it looks okay.
054:53:03 Schweickart (onboard): Hmm!
054:53:04 Scott: Roger. Do you have any words on a purge tonight?
054:53:08 McDivitt (onboard): You're getting a lot out of plane here. Is that 11 feet per second?
054:53:10 Evans: Say again. Words on a purge?
054:53:13 Scott: Roger. Do you want us to purge the fuel cells tonight?
054:53:19 Evans: Roger. Stand by.
Very long comm break.
054:53:24 Scott (onboard): We didn't lose too much.
054:53:29 McDivitt (onboard): Yes, but, Houston, I don't - I didn't know if I commented or not right there - right after SPS 5, but that was really some wild steering that we got on that one. I don't mean that we were out of ...
054:53:33 Scott (onboard): [Garble] wild.
054:53:34 McDivitt (onboard): ... it wasn't out of control or anything. It is just that we sure built up some large attitude errors.
054:53:43 Scott (onboard): Mister Wild, you're cranked up (laughter). Your errors went out to like 3 degrees or -
054:53:49 McDivitt (onboard): Yes, really out to about 5 or 6. They went off scale.
054:53:51 Schweickart (onboard): Did they really?
054:53:52 McDivitt (onboard): Yaw went way off scale. Went off scale and kept going out off about another degree and a half.
054:54:00 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, we're 2 percent low on A, 2 percent low in C, 1-1/2 percent low in B, l-l/2 percent low in D. That's not too bad.
054:54:21 McDivitt (onboard): No, shoot, I thought you had - I thought you were I getting ...
054:54:23 Schweickart (onboard): I did it wrong.
054:54:24 McDivitt (onboard): I thought [garble] went down farther today. That's what we are with respect to the nominal.
054:54:30 Scott (onboard): Yes.
054:54:31 McDivitt (onboard): That's pretty good.
Well, we've evidently lost communication with the spacecraft, it having moved beyond the Ascension tracking station range. Conversation that transpired during that last pass was between Dave Scott on the Apollo 9 crew and Ron Evans here in MCC. At 54 hours, 54 minutes GET this is Apollo Control.
054:54:32 Scott (onboard): That screwed up the first time.
054:54:36 McDivitt (onboard): Oh.
054:54:44 Schweickart (onboard): Houston, Apollo 9.
054:54:52 Schweickart (onboard): Dave, they call out a purge in the - in the Flight Plan?
054:54:55 Scott (onboard): Yes, I think they do, Rusty -
054:55:08 Scott (onboard): If I can find it.
054:55:25 Scott (onboard): Nope. They haven't been putting purges in here either.
054:55:29 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, they have.
054:55:42 Scott (onboard): Yes, they sure did.
054:55:54 Schweickart (onboard): Do we have any of that real food left?
054:55:57 Scott (onboard): Yes.
054:55:58 Schweickart (onboard): What is it?
054:56:00 Scott (onboard): I wonder.
054:56:05 Schweickart (onboard): Ugh, ham.
054:56:06 Scott (onboard): Oh, boy. That ought to make you thirsty.
054:56:12 Schweickart (onboard): Boy, I wish that sounded good. I really do. Man, I wish it sounded like it -
054:56:16 Scott (onboard): Yes.
054:56:24 Schweickart (onboard): It just doesn't sound good. Nothing sounds good. Even the thought of food doesn't sound good.
054:56:32 McDivitt (onboard): That's too bad. It takes a miserable situation and turns it around into an almost unbearable one.
054:56:38 Schweickart (onboard): Yes.
054:56:39 Scott (onboard): Hey, you can do almost anything, if you're not sick. You know? You can go and go and go. You get pissed off, but - sure, but you can go.
054:56:50 Schweickart (onboard): Yes. Okay, well, we got everything done in the powerdown except the DSKY ...
054:57:02 McDivitt (onboard): Did we ever get that state vector?
054:57:03 Schweickart (onboard): ... the fuel cell purge and the -
054:57:04 Scott (onboard): No.
054:57:06 McDivitt (onboard): I never thought it came up either -
054:57:08 Scott (onboard): We were in BLOCK.
054:57:10 McDivitt (onboard): Oh, we are in BLOCK when they tried to send it?
054:57:13 Scott (onboard): No, they didn't try to send it yet. They didn't try and send - I just said we are in BLOCK.
054:57:15 McDivitt (onboard): Oh. I guess [garble] timing.
054:57:23 Scott (onboard): Well, who wants to take their suit off? I'll help them.
054:57:27 McDivitt (onboard): You want to? I've had mine off first each night.
054:57:30 Scott (onboard): No, I beat you the first night.
054:57:32 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, you did.
054:57:33 McDivitt (onboard): It's Rusty's turn.
054:57:34 Scott (onboard): You going to take your suit off?
054:57:36 McDivitt (onboard): Yes, why don't we give Rusty his druthers.
054:57:39 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, I guess.
054:57:40 Scott (onboard): Get comfortable.
054:57:43 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, if I don't get sick getting comfortable.
054:57:46 Scott (onboard): Why don't you let all the rest of the powering down stuff and all that be ours, and you go get your suit off, clean up, try to eat, and go to bed?
054:57:56 Schweickart (onboard): Okay. Cleaning up sounds pretty good.
054:57:59 Scott (onboard): Get one of those towels and wash and ...
054:58:00 Schweickart (onboard): Yes.
054:58:02 Scott (onboard): ... all that stuff. That'll make you feel better.
054:58:08 Schweickart (onboard): Okay. You want to watch the radio?
054:58:09 Scott (onboard): Yes, I'll take it.
054:58:10 McDivitt (onboard): Tell you what, Rusty. Why don't we get up here in the top and let you unsuit, pack your suit away down here, and you could just go there on the bottom of your - of your seat, fold your seat up, and sit there and clean up while Dave and I take care of all the rest of this. You'd be out of the way, and you'd be vertical and -
054:58:36 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, SUIT POWER coming OFF.
054:59:35 McDivitt (onboard): That's fine.
055:03:53 Schweickart (onboard): Dave, [garble]?
055:03:54 Scott (onboard): Yes. Right up in the F-1, right above your head.
055:03:56 Schweickart (onboard): Okay.
055:04:03 Scott (onboard): That's F-1. Go ahead and I'll put it on.
055:04:09 McDivitt (onboard): Oh, no.
055:04:10 Scott (onboard): Boy oh boy, are you cute!
055:04:12 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble].
055:04:15 Scott (onboard): You'd make a great basketball player. I hope you been trying to teach your kids.
055:04:27 Scott (onboard): Oh, yes.
055:04:29 McDivitt (onboard): (Laughter)
055:04:35 Scott (onboard): No, go get it. Let's don't stuff up anymore in - of that good stuff in -
055:04:51 Schweickart (onboard): Hey.
055:04:52 Scott (onboard): [Garble].
055:05:03 McDivitt (onboard): You want to hand me that stuff and I'll [garble].
055:05:05 Scott (onboard): What?
055:05:06 McDivitt (onboard): That [garble] stuff.
055:05:07 Scott (onboard): No, I can get it. Go ahead. No sweat.
055:05:09 McDivitt (onboard): I'm not doing anything [Garble].
055:05:11 Scott (onboard): There's nothing going on now. We're not even there wherever "there" is.
055:06:07 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble] looks like [garble] getting [garble].
This is Apollo Control at 55 hours, 6 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We're about to acquire the spacecraft over the Tananarive site, should have it in a few more seconds. And at that time we will monitor any air-to-ground conversations between the crew and the ground here. We're standing by at the present time to monitor any conversation between MCC and Apollo 9.
According to the Flight Plan the Lunar Module Pilot is in the process of taking off his pressure garment assembly in preparation for his night's rest, or his rest cycle. He'll be followed by the Commander who will doff his pressure garment assembly so it could be that our conversation over this station will be limited. The crew is probably fairly busy buttoning up the spacecraft so to speak, for its - in preparation for the rest cycle that's coming up.
This pass over Tananarive has about 2 more minutes before the expected loss of signal. We'll stand by and continue to monitor any conversation if such conversation does transpire.
Our comm between Tananarive and the spacecraft has been - has had a history today of being rather poor. Apparently this is no departure from what we have done earlier. We still have about a half a minute of time left before the expected loss of signal. We'll continue to monitor any conversation that develops.
We have an indication that the spacecraft moved out of the range of the tracking station at Tananarive. Next up will be Guam on this the 35th revolution in the flight of Apollo 9. At 55 hours, 11 minutes this is Apollo Control.
055:11:33 Scott (onboard): I know it. Hey, you might check that screen down there where those suit circuits [garble] I cleaned it about an hour after you went over it this morning. It was filthy then.
055:11:53 McDivitt (onboard): It looked like it [garble] on it, or something on it.
055:11:56 Scott (onboard): Yes.
055:11:57 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble] something [garble] a lot of [garble] washing from [garble].
055:13:13 Scott (onboard): What?
055:13:14 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble] RCS [garble].
055:14:15 Schweickart (onboard): No. Thank you. I've got a stable position, here. Gravity gradient. I usually float up, but I'm not floating up tonight.
055:14:35 Scott (onboard): It's coming in on the PDA.
055:14:37 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble].
055:14:38 Scott (onboard): Yes.
055:14:39 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble] get past that period ...
055:14:44 Scott (onboard): That's right. Maybe you do overcome it. Very interesting.
055:15:16 McDivitt (onboard): Guess I'll go to bed later on.
055:18:09 Scott (onboard): Oh, I'll get one later, Jim. No, I've got one in my pocket. Thank you.
055:19:57 Scott (onboard): I'll tell you one thing, boy, that - that probe sure worked quick today. Oh boy, I couldn't believe it. I was a little afraid of the forces on putting it back in - that they had doubled. Gee, it was nothing. Less than 50 pounds all the way. Right number of strokes. Gee, it worked good. Those guys, they really ought to get a - a rose or something out there. They really did a good job.
055:20:22 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble].
055:20:23 Scott (onboard): Huh?
055:20:24 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble].
055:20:29 Scott (onboard): It's a new bunch of guys.
055:20:32 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble].
055:20:33 Scott (onboard): Oh, yes. They got a bunch - they got a couple of guys from LAD - He came from LAD. He was an airplane de designer. He didn't even know how to spell Apollo when he got there.
055:20:53 Scott (onboard): He's the guy that really did the most work on that latch. That's sort of his big project.
055:21:03 Scott (onboard): We haven't tried those yet - but once.
055:21:07 Scott (onboard): Yes.
055:21:11 Scott (onboard): Yes. It really looked nice.
055:21:21 Scott (onboard): I did notice that somebody going through caught one of those umbilical covers and popped it open. I mean that's no big deal. I just closed it. You know the little plastic ones that close down?
055:22:18 Scott (onboard): What? It should fold flat, Jim.
055:22:35 Scott (onboard): Yes, that center couch came out pretty good today, too. Yes. It's a lot easier to tell at zero g.
055:22:42 McDivitt (onboard): Really?
055:22:43 Scott (onboard): Oh, yes. Shoot, I'd - I had that flat done - I had the whole thing reconfigured from the time I'd - I had my helmet and gloves - I had to put helmet and gloves on. No, wait a minute - Took the couch out first. The end of the burn until I got the couch back in, and I was ready to put my helmet and gloves on - was 10 minutes from the time I started putting helmet and gloves on until I had the drogue out was 15 - which was really - That's pretty - that's pretty efficient, you know.
055:23:22 Scott (onboard): Yes, I rolled it up and put it down underneath there.
055:23:38 Scott (onboard): Sir?
055:24:14 McDivitt (onboard): Ouch! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
055:25:24 Scott (onboard): I think I stuck it in the front of the L-bag there, Rusty. I was in a pretty big hurry- I think. I put a bunch of stuff in there.
055:25:37 Schweickart (onboard): (Laughter) [Garble].
055:25:43 Scott (onboard): Find it?
055:28:33 Scott (onboard): Trying to figure out why we keep going the same way.
055:28:43 Scott (onboard): Oh, I know it.
055:28:48 Scott (onboard): Hey, there's a satellite. I [garble] see one. No, no, no. It's way out there, it's stable. You got to come up here and look down. You got to come up farther. And look down almost between minus Y and plus Z. [Garble] out of your way [garble] there it is.
055:29:23 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble].
055:29:24 McDivitt (onboard): See that, Dave?
055:29:29 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble].
055:29:30 Scott (onboard): No, there's only one! You guys saw a satellite last night. I see one tonight. That's the one.
055:29:40 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble].
055:29:42 Scott (onboard): A satellite! Go back to the LEB.
055:29:45 Schweickart (onboard): What?
055:29:46 Scott (onboard): Go back to the LEB! You don't like my little thing.
055:29:51 Schweickart (onboard): God, what is that? Oh, where'd you get it from?
055:30:05 Scott (onboard): Yes. Well, you know we ought to be able to ...
055:30:07 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble] stuff in there?
055:30:09 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble].
055:30:11 Scott (onboard): The one down there is useless - down here is all stuff. That one, I cleaned that out once this [garble].
055:30:32 Scott (onboard): I cleaned that out this morning. Thanks.
055:31:23 Scott (onboard): Hey, there's a big one. A great big one went by [garble].
055:31:56 Scott (onboard): Yes, this window's really getting foggy, isn't it?
055:32:08 Scott (onboard): That'll hold for a couple of days.
This is Apollo Control at 55 hours, 32 minutes into the flight. The station in Guam has acquired the spacecraft at the present time and we'll monitor the conversation if...
GUAM (REV 35)
055:32:42 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Guam.
055:32:46 Scott: Roger, Houston; Apollo 9. Go ahead.
055:32:51 Evans: Roger. We're kind of standing by for S-band lockup here to get an E-memory dump from you.
055:32:57 McDivitt: Oh, very well.
055:33:01 Scott: And we never saw the state vector go in.
055:33:04 Evans: Roger. It'll be coming in there shortly, as soon as they get the lockup.
055:33:08 Scott: Okay. [Long pause]
055:33:39 Evans: Okay, Apollo 9. Looks like we got it. Request a VERB 74, and give us a Mark when you do it.
055:33:46 Scott: Roger. Okay here we go: 3, 2, 1.
055:33:54 Scott: Mark. [Long pause]
Okay we're standing by here listening to some of their conversations. We'll continue to stand by and pick up some of their conversation if anymore transpires. I'm up, I was up on the pass.
055:34:34 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. While we're waiting here, we'd like to have an oral temperature from Rusty, and we recommend that he take one Maresine about an hour before his suiting tomorrow morning.
055:34:49 Schweickart: Roger. Understand. [Long pause]
055:35:24 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Request P00 and ACCEPT.
055:35:27 Scott: Roger have P00 and ACCEPT.
055:35:30 Evans: Okay. Should be coming up. We need a dosimeter readout, too, if you have those handy. [Pause]
Oh your going to, okay.
055:35:38 Scott: Okay. Stand by. We can give you two out of three.
055:35:42 Evans: Okay. [Long pause]
055:36:03 Scott: Okay. The CMP is 16111.
055:36:10 Evans: 16111. [Long pause]
This is Apollo Control, Houston. We want to break into this to try to summarize for you a private conversation that was held about 45 minutes ago with the crew. In summary, during the conversation Rusty Schweickart said that he had had no additional nausea during the day. I repeat Schweickart said he had had no additional nausea during the day. He did say that he did not have much of an appetite and that he had not had any lunch and also that he wasn't feeling completely up to par. Now for that and other reasons Apollo 9 commander Jim McDivitt at that point in the conversation came up on the line and recommended that the EVA portion of the flight be suspended with the LM hatch opening tomorrow. Project officials here in Houston concurred unanimously with that judgement and it has been decided that the exterior LM pilot transfer part of the lunar, of the EVA exercise tomorrow will in fact be eliminated. In addition to Rusty Schweickart's well being, other factors which came to bear on the decision the recommendation of Jim McDivitt which subsequently became the decision, included the finding this morning of just how tight the time line was, associated with preparations for the transfer. This was mentioned several times in the conversation that factors which the crew had anticipated would go faster than they had hoped. In general it was an extremely busy, very tight transfer, and this fact came into play in the decision. Another factor was, that by reducing, taking the EVA out of the, the Schweickart transfer out of the exercise tomorrow, will permit an overall saving of approximately one and a half hours on the total operation, and this will give the crew additional rest time coming up on the critical rendezvous exercise planned for Friday. The exact time for, the exact time lines for tomorrows operations are presently being shaped here by Flight Planners and will, this activity will go on for several hours. But before those precise time lines are available we are able to identify these major activities that will be included in the operation tomorrow. For one Rusty Schweickart will go on the PLSS completely, he will be dependant on it. The number 2, the LM cabin will be depressed and the LM hatch will be removed. Number 3 the command module hatch also will be opened. Number 4, the exact time of the television pass has yet to be determined, it could move forward or move up as much as an hour and a half but we will have a television pass, the precise nature of it is not yet known, but it'll probably include a tour of the Lunar Module, and perhaps a look down the tunnel, a look out the windows, and that sort of thing. No precise plan yet but it will be a 15 minute pass and the time will be determined later this evening. It will be passed to you as soon as we have it. In concluding the conversations project officials stated to the crew that they were extremely pleased with the performance of the Lunar Module in its first manned flight, and they congratulated the crew on a job very well done. That concluded the conversation at about 4:50 P central standard time. We're going to go back now and we have some tape which has been accumulated while we have talked. We'll play that for you at this time.
055:36:21 Scott: CDR's is zero 3111.
055:36:26 Evans: 03111. [Pause]
055:36:38 Evans: 9, Houston. On the first contact we had today, they were recorded real good at the site, and evidently we had just a bit of a problem getting them back to MCC; but the COMM checks were good.
055:36:50 Scott: Oh, very good. Okay. What kind of heater/fan configuration would you like tonight on the CRYO.
055:36:59 Evans: Okay. We will give that to you over Texas; probably heaters off and we'll have the fan on. Okay...
055:37:08 Scott: Okay. We'll be standing by for your word.
055:37:10 Evans: Okay. And I've got a NAV check for you if you're ready to copy it.
055:37:14 Scott: Stand by. [Long pause]
055:37:34 Scott: Okay. Go ahead with the NAV check.
055:37:37 Evans: Okay. Of course, the purposes for going off the range: GET 056 30 0000, minus 3251, -00910, 1258. Over.
055:38:03 Scott: Roger. 056 30 0000, minus 3251, minus 00910 1258.
055:38:15 Evans: Roger. It's good and the computer is yours.
055:38:18 Scott: Oh, very well. Thank you. [Pause]
055:38:32 Evans: 9, Houston. Another thing we came to a conclusion here was that we had to be in high bit rate for the PINGS to AGS initialization. [Pause]
055:38:48 Scott: Roger. Understand.
055:38:50 Scott (onboard): Hey, they said they had to be in HIGH BIT RATE for the PGNCS-to-AGS initialization.
055:38:56 Evans: Now, we're just about to LOS here. I'll give you some more dope on tomorrow's activities when we get over Hawaii.
055:39:04 Scott: Okay. Understand.
055:39:05 Scott (onboard): And he also said ...
055:39:06 Evans: And you might be thinking about if there's any changes in the window fogging from yesterday. [Pause]
055:39:11 Scott: Roger. Today.
055:39:12 Scott (onboard): No. Well, yes, as a matter of fact...
055:39:13 Scott: The left-hand rendezvous window was fogging a little more around the edges. It looks like it'll be okay for the rendezvous, but it's [garble].
Comm break.
055:39:18 Scott (onboard): - the only one of the bunch that's degrading. The rest of them still look pretty good.
055:39:34 Scott (onboard): By-by, Houston.
055:39:39 Scott (onboard): Said the PLSS COMM checks were all good. They were having trouble with the sites. They recorded them, and sent them back from the sites and they all sounded real good.
055:41:02 Scott (onboard): That was pretty good.
055:41:25 Scott (onboard): Night-night, computer.
055:41:42 Scott (onboard): Are you getting your oral thermometer, or temperature? Oh, isn't that cute?
055:41:59 Scott (onboard): Hey, you know, these books really aren't too bad the way they're set up. They're really not bad. It's where - We all got stuff to play with.
055:42:19 Scott (onboard): Yes. Or maybe - or maybe we're just not smart enough to be able to change it. You have - you know, roll with the punch.
055:42:38 Scott (onboard): Yes. And - and if somebody's passing a block update you could still be working with the other stuff. I don't think they're bad. Given 7 more days, I bet we'd think they're probably pretty good.
055:42:56 Scott (onboard): Hey, I don't know what to do with this thing.
055:43:07 Scott (onboard): You know, it -
055:43:16 Scott (onboard): Got to do that. I was all ready. I know it. I know it.
055:43:52 Scott (onboard): What is it?
055:43:58 Scott (onboard): Nominal, 98?
055:44:00 Scott (onboard): That's probably close, to nominal, isn't it? Well, see, that should convince you you're not sick. It convinced me.
055:44:24 Scott (onboard): I guess, if you don't have anything to eat. Oh, I'm sorry. Anybody want something?
055:44:33 Scott (onboard): I hate to put this camera up there without a lens on it, because I'm afraid some dirt will get in it. Huh? No, this lens doesn't fit on it - on the window. Yes, let's put it in here. Let me -
We just caught up on the tape of the pass that transpired over Guam while they reported a private conversation was being read. The spacecraft at the present time is out of the tracking range of the Guam station, it's approaching Hawaii. We will expect to acquire that in about two minutes and we will come up again at that time. At 55 hours 44 minutes GET this is Apollo Control.
055:45:03 Scott (onboard): You know, I was going to take a picture after you dock [garble] burn. No, you had the lens. There wasn't anything to take a picture of anyway.
055:45:19 Scott (onboard): Yes, I never saw a plume either, and I looked hard.
055:45:27 Scott (onboard): Oh, Yes.
055:45:38 Scott (onboard): Here you go, Rusty.
055:46:07 Scott (onboard): Oh yes, well -
055:46:23 Scott (onboard): Here's a power cable you can stick in there, Jim.
055:46:46 Scott (onboard): Yes, they sure are.
055:46:53 Scott (onboard): Oh, I always thought that was a pretty good idea.
This is Apollo Control at 55 hours, 48 minutes into the flight. The spacecraft now has been acquired by Hawaii, the Hawaii tracking station, and there has been a little conversation. We are prepared to play that back for you now and then catch up and go live with it.
HAWAII (REV 35)
055:47:03 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Hawaii.
055:47:07 Scott: Roger. Houston, Apollo 9.
055:47:10 Evans: Okay. I missed your comment on the windows there as you went over the hill.
055:47:15 Scott: Okay. The windows are looking pretty good. All of them are just fine as a matter of fact, except the left-hand rendezvous window. And the film that we had yesterday is continuing to grow, the little light band around the edges. It'll be fine for the rendezvous but interesting to see how long it lasts on into the 10 days. Let's see, only one of the bunch, really, that looks like it has a problem. The little circle that was in the center of the hatch window hasn't seemed to grow any. And the rest of them are remaining about the same, pretty good.
055:47:49 Evans: Okay.
055:47:52 Scott: And temperature is about 98.6.
055:47:55 Evans: Roger. 98.6. Okay. I've got a few comments on tomorrow's time lines if you're ready to copy and listen, there, I guess. [Pause]
055:48:18 Scott: Okay. Just a second.
055:48:20 Evans: Okay. Basically what we've planned is to stay on the normal timeline for both vehicles up to the point of going EVA. And when we got into the PLSS things there, we'll go through the normal PLSS hookup, but stay on the LM ECS hoses in suit disconnect from the LM, instead of connecting the OPS. [Pause]
055:48:55 Scott: Okay.
055:48:56 Evans: Okay. We want to keep the TV pass as scheduled, and it's kind of dealer's choice there, shots inside the LM, tunnel, or whatever you want.
055:49:10 Scott: Okay.
055:49:13 Evans: Okay. Do you have any druthers on the PLSS COMM? We were thinking that maybe you - going ahead and use the LM relay mode.
055:49:22 Scott: All right. Stand by.
Comm break.
055:50:43 Evans: 9, Houston.
055:50:45 Scott: Roger. Go ahead.
055:50:51 Scott: Houston, 9. Go ahead.
055:50:52 Evans: Roger. We're curious. Did Rusty take a Marezine and a Lomotil this morning? [Pause]
055:51:04 Scott: That's affirmative.
055:51:06 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
055:51:11 Scott: We're massaging your plan right now.
055:51:14 Evans: Okay. [Pause]
055:51:20 Slayton: 9, this is Deke. How do you read?
055:51:23 Scott: Say again.
055:51:24 Slayton: Deke here. How do you read?
055:51:26 Scott: Stand by one, Deke.
055:51:28 Slayton: Okay. [Long pause]
055:52:04 Scott: Okay. Go ahead.
055:52:06 Slayton: Roger. I think we had LOS on you before we finished our last transmission. I thought I'd let you know that everybody down here is very happy with the way the day has gone and I'd like to congratulate you for an outstanding job.
055:52:16 Scott: Thank you.
Comm break.
GOLDSTONE (REV 35)
055:53:29 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
055:53:31 McDivitt: Roger, Houston. Go ahead.
055:53:33 Evans: Roger. I think we might add a little bit to what we were saying about tomorrow, and that is that we intend to just have the hatch open only during the first daylight pass and then button it up.
055:53:48 McDivitt: Roger. Fading out. We haven't got a solid lock I don't think, yet. Would you say it once more, please?
055:53:55 Evans: Okay. How are we now?
055:53:59 McDivitt: Okay, I think you're coming in better now.
055:54:02 Evans: I might add that we plan to have the hatch open only during the first daylight pass and then button it up rather than going all the way around with the hatch open.
055:54:16 McDivitt: Roger. Yes, I'd like to finish up tomorrow's activities a little earlier, if we can.
055:54:24 Evans: We understand that.
055:54:27 McDivitt: Okay. We only have a 7 and a half hour rest period tomorrow night, and I want to make sure that we have enough time to configure the spacecraft for the transfer the next day and still get some sleep.
055:54:41 Evans: Concur.
055:54:42 McDivitt: It looks like we're going to have to open the hatch at normal time, leave it open for that daylight pass, close it, configure it for the TV, and when the TV is over then we would leave the LM, come back in the command module. Is that right?
055:55:00 Evans: That's right, and as a matter of fact, we don't even want the TV to interrupt the transfer. If possible you can, you know, start the transfer early.
055:55:09 McDivitt: Oh, okay. I see what you're - You're saying that we plan to follow normal time line and when we get to the time to open the hatch, as we do that, leave them open during the first daylight pass, close them up, and then we egress the LM, and tune in the TV on the way out, sort of.
055:55:25 Evans: Something like that, yes.
055:55:28 McDivitt: Yes, that sounds like a pretty reasonable plan.
055:55:34 Evans: And, 9, Houston. While we've got a little bit of COMM here, I've got some block data number 7 for you.
055:55:41 McDivitt: Okay. We'll whip up the pad here. One thing that we - you might take under advisement is be prepared for us to be a little bit late in the morning because it's really a scramble trying to get suited, and once you get suited you become all tangled up in these hoses, so we have to take a little - It takes a bit longer, I guess, in the morning than we really have allotted in the Flight Plan. So we may be just a little late getting over there.
055:56:06 Evans: Okay. we understand.
055:56:09 McDivitt: I think ones we get to the LM, we find that we worked that through enough and there's not that much jumping around that requires to take too much longer than normal.
055:56:20 Evans: Okay.
055:56:23 McDivitt: Okay. Go ahead with your block data. [Pause]
TEXAS (REV 36)
055:56:35 Scott: Houston, go ahead with the block data. We're ready.
055:56:44 Evans: 9, Houston. One more thing here. We plan to turn H2 tank 1 fan on at 56 plus 00.
055:56:54 Scott: Say again the time, please.
055:56:55 Evans: At 56 plus 00.
055:56:59 Scott: H2 fan 1 on at 56 plus 00.
055:57:04 Evans: Roger. And how about S-band volume up at 56 plus 22. We'll try an S-band ARIA pass. [Pause]
055:57:20 Scott: Okay, S-band volume 56 plus 22. [Pause]
055:57:28 Evans: Okay. Now we're ready for block data.
055:57:34 Scott: Okay. Go ahead.
055:57:37 Evans: Area 039 3 Alpha, plus 273, plus 1450 061 35 08 4355; 040 Alpha Charlie, minus 091, minus 0120 062 29 34 4355; 041 Alpha Charlie, minus 008, minus 0230 064 02 26 4355; 042 Alpha Charlie, plus 090, minus 0320 065 35 55 4355. Still with me, 9? [Pause]
055:59:22 Scott: Roger. Press on.
055:59:24 Evans: 043 2 Alpha, plus 247, minus 0270 067 12 51 4355; 044 Alpha Charlie, plus 313 0 - belay that - minus 0290 068 46 52 4355. And 9, your SPS trims: pitch, minus 0.9; yaw, minus 1.1. Houston, over. [Pause]
056:00:38 Scott: Roger. I didn't know Retro had so many areas.
056:00:41 Evans: Yes. He's got a batch of them.
056:00:46 Scott: Okay. I guess we start at 039 3 Alpha, right? [Pause]
056:00:50 Evans: Affirmative
056:00:52 Scott: Plus 273, plus 1450, 061 35 08 4355; 040 Alpha Charlie, minus 091, minus 0120 062 29 34 4355; 041 Alpha Charlie, minus 008, minus 230 064 02 26 4355; 042 Alpha Charlie, plus 090, minus 0320 065 35 55 4355; 043 2 Alpha, plus 247, minus 0270 067 12 51 4355; 044 Alpha Charley, plus 313, minus 0290 068 46 52 4355.
056:02:04 Evans: 9, Houston. Your readback is correct. And request you verify a CO2 canister change there a while back.
056:02:11 Scott: That's verified, on time.
056:02:13 Evans: Roger.
056:02:15 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
056:02:18 Evans: Houston, here.
056:02:19 McDivitt: Do you have any good information on why our rendezvous radar data wasn't getting into the computer?
056:02:25 Evans: We've got the bigheads moving it over down here, and we haven't come up with a real good answer yet.
056:02:33 McDivitt: Okay. Did you get any good downlink data from those checks that we did?
056:02:39 Evans: Say, again.
056:02:42 McDivitt: Did you get any downlink data from the rendezvous radar checks that we did?
056:02:49 Evans: That's affirmative. We did get some data.
056:02:52 McDivitt: Okay. So you have the data to look at, too.
056:02:53 Evans: Yes.
056:02:56 McDivitt: Okay. We'll be standing by anxiously to find out what your conclusion is.
056:03:00 Evans: Okay. And the computer is yours; you can go to BLOCK on the computer.
056:03:05 Scott: Okay. And it's already put to bed. [Pause]
056:03:13 Scott: Say, Houston. Say, we've got H2 heaters OFF now and O2 heaters on.
056:03:21 Evans: Say again, Dave. [Long pause]
056:04:09 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. [Long pause]
056:04:42 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. The Apollo 9 spacecraft has moved out of the range of the Texas Station at the present time, and since there will be no more air-to-ground for about 17 minutes, NASA will pull down the PL release line for about 10 or so minutes to conduct some audio checks. We expect to be back up for the transmission from an ARIA aircraft, that's an Apollo range instrumentation aircraft at about 56 hours, 22 minutes. At 56 hours, 6 minutes, of ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 56 hours, 22 minutes into the flight. We anticipate that we will have some communication between the Mission Control Center here in Houston and the crew at about this time, and that communication should come through on Apollo Range Instrumentation Aircraft, identified as an ARIA. We will standby to monitor any conversation on that. The spacecraft now is in its 36 rev. If we have com, it should be coming shortly.
We have a report that we have intermittent acquisition of signal with ARIA 5, we will continue to monitor.
ARIA (REV 36)
056:2X:XX Evans: ARIA 5, Houston CAPCOM go remote.
056:2X:XX Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through ARIA 5.
056:2X:XX Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
056:2X:XX Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
056:2X:XX Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through AIRA.
056:2X:XX Evans: ARIA 5, Houston CAP COMM. Let's try VHF uplink and downlink.
Astronaut Ron Evans has been trying to call the crew through ARIA 5. He is now trying VHF to see if we can get comm with the crew.
056:2X:XX Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through ARIA.
056:2X:XX Scott: Roger. Houston, Apollo 9. You're garbled, but readable.
056:26:24 Evans: Roger. We are VHF at this time. I tried you on S-band. Did you hear me at all?
056:26:31 Scott: Negative, we didn't hear you on S-band, and I've got it turned up.
056:26:38 Evans: Okay. Evidently the S-band didn't work. Let's go ahead and keep the VHF here. We will try S-band at the end of the pass again. Got some good dope for you on the rendezvous radar DSKY test.
056:26:51 Scott: Standby a minute. [Long pause]
056:27:20 Scott: Okay Houston, go ahead.
056:27:22 Evans: Roger. The downlink shows that the rendezvous radar self test is okay, and in checking it out a little bit more, the self-test doesn't show up on the DSKY because the antenna is in the stowed position. [Pause]
056:27:53 Scott: Okay. Understand Houston. Downlink shows that the RR self-test is okay, and the reason that it didn't show up on the DSKY was because it was in the STOWED position.
056:28:04 Evans: That is affirmative. We ginned up a procedure so that you could look at it on a DSKY. However, since it was good on the downlink, rather than mess around with a new procedure, we will probably go ahead - we'd like to go ahead and say it works, and try it out on rendezvous day.
056:28:XX Scott: Okay, understand.
056:28:XX Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
056:28:31 Scott: Stand by one, Houston.
056:28:33 Evans: Houston, GO.
056:28:37 Scott: Standby Houston. [Long pause]
056:29:11 Scott: Houston, 9.
056:29:13 Evans: Houston, GO.
056:29:15 Scott: Okay. How about whipping those procedures into reasonable form? And, if there is time tomorrow, I guess we would like to look at that, and perhaps even stowe it - just to get the feeling onboard. Okay?
056:29:30 Evans: Okay. We can do that for you; and we will have it for you tomorrow.
056:29:34 Scott: Okay. Very well, thank you. [Pause]
056:29:46 Evans: Okay. That was the USB we're talking on here. It looks like we are about LOS, and talk is not too good over Tananarive. So, if you don't hear from us, have a good night's sleep.
056:29:58 Scott: Okay. Thank you very much. We'll see you in the morning.
056:30:02 Evans: Roger.
That conversation was between Astronaut Ron Evans here at Mission Control and Dave Scott, the Command Module pilot. We still have about 45 seconds of time in which the ARIA could pick up the spacecraft. We could have additional comm, so we will standby for a few more moments or a few more seconds before turning down the line.
We have apparently passed out of range of the tracking aircraft ARIA, the Apollo Range Instrumentation Aircraft. Next station to acquire will be Tananarive at 56 hours, 40 minutes. That is about 8 minutes from now. There may be some communication from air to ground at that particular time. In the meantime at 56 hours, 32 minutes ground elapsed, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 56 hours, 52 minutes, ground elapsed time. We monitored the pass over Tananarive, which occurred a few moments ago, and at that time there was no com - no air-to-ground communication between Mission Control and the crew. The crew evidently is in the process of settling down for their rest cycle and hopefully for a good night's sleep for them - or a period of sleep for them. We will continue to stand by and watch the circuits in the meantime at 56 hours and 53 minutes with the spacecraft now heading out over the Indian Ocean. This is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 57 hours, 50 minutes into the mission. We've had no new or additional communication with the crew since our last report. The spacecraft at the present time is on the 37th rev flying over - crossing South America. During a recent pass in which Redstone had acquisition, we received no downlink of bio-instrumentation leading the flight surgeon, Dr. John Zieglschmid, to conclude that the crew is probably in the stages of finishing its light housekeeping preparation for a sleep portion during the rest cycle. We've maintained a silence here in an effort to permit the crew to have as much rest time as possible after their having completed a rather busy day checking out the systems on Spider, the LM spacecraft. All systems seem to be working well as far as the spacecrafts are concerned. At 57 hours, 52 minutes into the flight of Apollo 9, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 58 hours 57 minutes ground elapsed time. The spacecraft at the present time has been acquired by the tracking station at Hawaii. And we have been observing to see if there was any biomedical data that would be down late. At this particular time there is no indication that biomedical data is being downlinked. We'll continue to observe that. Meanwhile other data, as far as the spacecraft systems are concerned looks good. The Hawaii station will have the spacecraft for another 4 or 5 minutes, and then we'll have about 5 minutes of acquisition by the tracking ship Redstone. We'll continue to monitor the systems and come back up if there is any significant change. At 58 hours 59 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control, at 59 hours, 15 minutes, into the mission. During the last part of the Hawaii pass, and the portion of the Redstone pass, the flight surgeon received some bio-medical information on the command module pilot, that would have been Dave Scott who is in the right couch and the initial indications were that his rates were 60 beats per minute and respiration was averaging about 20 per minute. During the balance of the pass across Redstone, those rates were decreasing, leading the flight surgeon to suspect that Dave was in the process of going to sleep - settling down for sleep. We have not received any bio-medical parameters on the other two astronauts; however, since conversation has been kept to a minimum, no conversation in fact, since early in the flight after Tananarive following the SPS-5 burn, we believe that they have settled down also and all three are resting, perhaps the other two are sleeping, also. At 59 hours, 17 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 59 hours, 59 minutes, GET time. We have some more definitive information on the revised time line, covering the activities on day 4, that is tomorrow. The Flight Plan is essentially the same, up to LM hatch opening, which is approximately - which occurs approximately 72 hours, 50 minutes, GET. The hatches in the LM and the CSM will remain open for approximately 1 daylight pass during that general time range. Then they will be closed at approximately 74 hours GET. This closing is about an hour and one-half earlier than that in the original Flight Plan. During the CSM hatch opening, the Command Module pilot, Dave Scott, will attempt to retrieve those thermal samples, which are near the CSM hatch, if he can at all possibly do it. The TV pass that was scheduled for 75 hours, GET, has been moved up slightly. Goldstone acquisition will be 74 hours, 57 minutes. During this time, we expect that the Commander will either be in the process of transferring from LM back to Command Service Module, or - he will either be actually transferring or will be making preparations for it. This information should be transmitted to us during the TV pass. What we will do essentially is finish the operation, approximately, or this exercise, approximately one and one-half hours earlier than the Flight Plan shows. Some of the other activities that could take place during that period of time will be to catch up or redo some of the communication checks, which were missed today. And, of course, have the TV camera show the LM interior more in detail, than was shown on the pass we had on day 3. Now, one and one-half hours of time that is saved, will be time that probably is used to reconfigure or probably can be used to reconfigure the CSM in preparation for the rendezvous exercise which is scheduled for day number 5. And then also, the time could be used for additional rest period for the crew. Some of that time could be devoted to an additional rest period for the crew. More definitive time line information is still being worked on by the flight control people here at Mission Control. For administrative announcement for those who are interested, as I said earlier, Goldstone acquisition is 74:57:25. And the MILA loss of signal is now set at 75:13. During our last transmission at 59 hours, 17 minutes, we reported incorrectly that our last previous conversation or the last previous conversation between MCC and the crew, the Apollo 9 crew, occurred during the pass over Tananarive. The last conversation between the crew and ground occurred during the ARIA acquisition at 56:22. That is from that time frame 56:22 to 56:32 GET. At 60 hours, and 4 minutes into the flight of Apollo 9, with the spacecraft now over India and with the astronauts in their rest period, with one of them fairly well - fairly soundly asleep, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 60 hours, 48 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 9 is over the Pacific Ocean at the present time approaching the west coast of South America. And on this, the 38th rev, the crew has settled down during this rest cycle. Biomedical data on the Commander and the Command Module Pilot recently was monitored and the information led the Surgeons to conclude that the CMP, that's Dave Scott, was soundly asleep while Jim McDivitt, the Commander, was resting, but perhaps not soundly asleep. Scott's heart rate was in the low 40's. That is his average heart rate, his mean heart rate. While the Commander's heart rate was in the 70's. The cabin pressure in Apollo 9 is holding steady at 4.9 pounds per square inch and the temperature is about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. All of the systems seem to be functioning well on the spacecraft at this time. There is - meanwhile here at Mission Control there is a beehive of activity with the shifts just about ready to change. The Gold Team, which has been on for the past several hours, is about ready to leave and it will be replaced by the team identified as the Orange Team. At 60 hours, 51 minutes Ground Elapsed Time this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 61 hours 50 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 9 is presently just south of Japan, in two minutes we'll be acquired and its pulse felt by the tracking station at Guam. The crewmen in Apollo 9 are apparently still asleep, we've had no conversation. At this time of the night the orbital track is more or less on the backside of the range and as we go further into the night the orbital track will begin to come over the stations in Australia and Ascension Island and so on in the South Atlantic but station passes drop off to one or two stations per revolution until we come back over the range, so to speak, of Carnarvon and the Stateside series of stations. Mercury, tracking ship Mercury in the South Pacific will pick up the spacecraft at 10 minutes past the hour. We will monitor these passes in case the crew does call in but no attempts will be made to converse with the crew unless they call us. At 61 hours 51 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control. Apollo 9 is presently over the tracking station at Ascension Island coming up on the west coast of Africa. At the begining of revolution number 40, the measurements of the present orbit are still showing 124.1 nautical mile perigee by 128.6 nautical mile apogee. Total spacecraft weight is now computed to be 49,394 lbs. We've got quite a gap between the Ascension pass with loss of signal in less than a minute from Ascension and not aquiring the next station at Guam until 25 minutes past the hour. At 62 hours, 50 minutes GET; this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control. 63 hours, 50 minutes ground elapse time. Apollo 9 has just passed out of range of the tracking ship Mercury in the South Pacific preceded by a pass over the tracking ship Huntsville and the tracking station at Guam. Nearing the end of the 40th revolution, flight surgeon Ken Beers reported that his telemetry readouts biomedical information on the crew men that are connected to the biomedical harnesses show that they were resting fairly well, although with some slight stirrings during the passes where the data was available. We'll be coming up over the Ascension Island station at 18 minutes past the hour however it is not anticipated that there will be any conversation now. Spacecraft communicator Ron Evans has come back into the control center after being spelled by Al Warden for a short period. At 63 hours 51 minutes Ground elapse time this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 64 hours, 50 minutes GET. Some 2 hours remaining in the Apollo 9 rest period. All three crewmen are apparently sleeping rather well. Apollo 9 presently is flying over the northern portion of India. The next station pass will be over Guam with acquisition scheduled at 59 minutes past the hour. This, in turn, joins the Huntsville tracking ship pass followed thereafter by the Mercury for almost continuous pass wherein the spacecraft systems will be monitored on the ground, and also the crew bioenvironmental data will be read out on the ground. At 64 hours 51 minutes GET, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 65 hours 50 minutes GET. Apollo 9 has just began it's 42 revolution and is crossing the East coast of Brazil. We'll be coming up on the Canary Island station in some 6 minutes. During the pass toward the end of the 41 revolution over the tracking ship Mercury, the telemetry read out showed the cabin pressure holding at 4.9 lbs per square inch. Cabin temperature 65 1/4 F. The sleep clock shows another 59 minutes, almost a full hour remaining in the sleep period, or rest period for the Apollo 9 crew, and the accumulative time of rest is now 8 hours, 50 minutes. At 65 hours 51 minutes GET time this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 66 hours, 50 minutes ground elapse time. The crew of Apollo 9 at this time is scheduled to end its sleep period. We're less than a minute away from acquisition at the tracking ship Mercury in the South Pacific. There may be problems in communications during this pass. The comsat relay antenna on the Mercury seems to be acting up somewhat however there is a stand by high frequency relay available for relaying voice communications back to the mission control center. Meanwhile the spacecraft analysis report on systems shows that the cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen for the fuel cells in the command service module are holding pretty well at nominal values. Quantities ranging around 75 percent of cryogenic oxygen in both tanks and around 70 percent average on both tanks of hydrogen. In total weight there are 487 pounds of oxygen in both tanks and 40 pounds of hydrogen. Fuel cell performance is quite nominal. The temperatures in the fuel cell are holding very tight limits and the performance all around seems to be quite excellent with no problems. All the Command and Service Module temperatures are registering along the normal range. And another recommendation by the spacecraft analysis people for the TV pass coming up at ground elapse time of 74 hours, 57 minutes. They recommend the LM forward omni antenna be used for the Gold Stone tracking station until about midway through the pass when the handover is to the Merritt Island station at which time they would switch to the aft or number two omni all the way through the end of Merritt Island loss of signal. This likely would improve or optimize the TV pass. We're standing by here at the Mercury for a possible call by spacecraft communicator Ron Evans to the crew. To continue with the spacecraft analysis systems report, battery B is still on charge. Charge has been in progress as of the time of this report of more than ten hours and battery B has received some 5.7 amp-hours of charging. Batteries A and C remain unchanged in their status. In the propulsion and power area of the spacecraft, all the measurements there are reading normal. The Lunar Module reaction control system propellant quantities remain unchanged. In the command module, command and service module reaction control system propellants have quantities totaling 870 pounds. There goes the call now.
