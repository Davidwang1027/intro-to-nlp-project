This is Apollo Control at 227 hours, 13 minutes GET. About 35 minutes ago the spacecraft was over the, or over the Ascension Island tracking site. And at that time the ground received some information on, biomedical information, on the Commander and Command Module Pilot who were in their couches and were beginning their rest cycle. The information was interpreted by the Flight Surgeon as follows. The astronauts were not asleep but were resting. At same time the spacecraft data was downlinked and the systems were working normally; no anomalies in any of the telemetry data that was downlinked. At the present time the spacecraft is just off the coast of China and will be within range of the tracking site at Guam. We do not anticipate any conversation since the crew are in their rest cycle. So at 227 hours, 15 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 228 hours, 53 minutes into the flight. Apollo 9 is over the Pacific Ocean at the present time, acquired by the tracking station at Guam. According to the information that is being downlinked, both the Commander and the Command Module Pilot are sleeping rather soundly at this time. On this, the 144 revolution with some 11 hours, 37 minutes remaining in the flight. At 228 hours, 54 minutes; this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 230 hours, 37 minutes. The tracking ship Huntsville has the Apollo 9 spacecraft in acquisition at the present time and according to the information that's coming down from the spacecraft, all of the systems are working normally. The astronauts, according to the biomedical information, are in a rather sound sleep. We're about 9 hours, 53 minutes from ignition time for deorbit and something less than 3 hours from the time when the ground will awaken the crew so that they can continue their preparations for re-entry. At this particular time, we're experiencing a shift change here with the Orange Team, the one that will have the re-entry exercise, taking over from the Gold Team. All systems seem to be working, functioning normally. The spacecraft will next be acquired by the tracking ship Mercury at 42 after the hour or about 3 or 4 minutes from now. At 230 hours, 39 minutes; this is Mission Control.
This is Apollo Control. 231 hours, 50 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 9 presently is over India, about 1/3 of the way through the 146th revolution. 1 hour, 44 minutes remain in the crew's sleep period. We're 8 hours, 41 minutes away from the due [sic] orbit burn time. At 231 hours, 51 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 232 hours, 50 minutes GET. Apollo 9 presently is over Venezuela and has just begun the 147th revolution, and also has entered acquisition at the Antigua tracking station. The crew is still asleep at this time, with some 44 minutes remaining in the crew rest period. The retrofire countdown clock now shows 7 hours, 40 minutes remaining. The time of retrofire will likely shift back and forth a few seconds one way or the other during the course of the morning as the stateside tracking begins to come in, and the spacecraft moves back onto the range. Following Loss of Signal at Madrid, Carnarvon will acquire the spacecraft at 35 minutes past the hour which should be the initial wake-up call over Carnarvon during this revolution. The crew will be quite busy during the morning getting all their numbers passed up to them from the ground. The maneuver entry numbers and so-called PADs where they copy down numbers from the ground, and they go through many tests of all their spacecraft systems that are vital to the entry maneuver. And at 232 hours, 51 minutes GET; this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control; 233 hours, 35 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Coming up on Carnarvon, Australia tracking station. Spacecraft communicator Stu Roosa will give the crew a wakeup call during this pass. Apollo 9 presently is in an orbit measuring 98.2 nautical miles [181.9 km] at perigee, 243 nautical miles [450 km] at apogee. Spacecraft weight is now showing on the displays being 24,902 pounds [11,295 kg]. Standing by for the initial call during recent pass over Canary Islands during the last, during this revolution, revolution 147. Flight surgeon Ken Beers said that the crew roused briefly as he interpreted it. Sounds like Stu Roosa may be getting prepared to make his call.
Comm break.
CARNARVON [REV 147 ]
233:36:26 Roosa: [alarm clock ringing] the alarm clock just went off, gentlemen.
233:36:30 McDivitt: Roger. I thought I heard a little dingaling there, Mr. Alarm Clock.
233:36:37 Roosa: Alright. Out of the sack, troops; let's get to work. Today you come home.
233:36:41 McDivitt: Hot diggity dog! I think we're already.
233:36:46 Scott: Okay. What would you like to do?
233:36:48 Roosa: Okay. What do you have in front of you?
233:36:52 Scott: [Garble] switch, I think.
233:36:55 Roosa: Okay. Do you want to start with the consumables?
233:37:00 Scott: Okay. Stand by.
233:37:16 Scott: Alrighty. Go with the consumables.
233:37:18 Roosa: Okay. 234 hours: 42 10 42 12 33 13 38 13 195 11 40 31 39. Okay. And your DAP red line: 25 31 34 34.
233:38:01 Scott: Roger. 234 42 10 42 12 33 13 38 13 195 11 40 31 39 25 31 34 and 34.
233:38:19 Roosa: Roger. And you've probably noticed, there, quad C is a little low. However, we still have both DAP and SCS capability using 4 jet / 2 jet.
233:38:34 Scott: Okay. Understand.
233:38:37 Roosa: All right. And one other comment before we get too far: I'd like to just mention that the DAP is still cycling, so when you get squared away on that - I just want to let you know that the DAP is still powered up.
233:38:53 Scott: Oh, is it really? That's very interesting.
233:38:56 Roosa: Okay. And, let me see. Oh, one thing else, I guess. I - just for your info, on the batteries, we are computing that you've got 71 hours on the water, if that question ever comes up.
233:39:13 Scott: Okay. Take a look at our Verb 46 right now.
233:39:19 Roosa: Okay. The story I have here, Dave, is that you need a Verb 46 enter to really kill the DAP.
233:39:28 McDivitt: I put that in last night, too, Stu.
233:39:30 Roosa: Say again, please?
233:39:32 McDivitt: I put that in last night, too.
233:39:34 Roosa: Oh. Okay. We'll have them take another look then. Okay. I have some block data for you.
233:40:01 Scott: Okay. Stand by.
233:40:11 Scott: Okay. Go with the block data.
233:40:13 Roosa: Okay. And make sure your S-band volume is up. We might pass over Honeysuckle before I finish up.
233:40:21 Scott: All right.
233:40:22 Roosa: Okay. Reading: 148 1 Bravo, plus 256, minus 0640 233:53:37:40.46; 149 1 Charlie, plus 314 minus 0680 235:30:22 3635; 150 2 Bravo, plus 270, minus 0310 237:27:07 3159 ; 151 1 Charlie, plus 309, minus 0670 238:51:15 3033; 152 2 Alpha, plus 233, minus 0680 240:32:58 3402; 153 4 Bravo, plus 336, minus 1610 243:11:54 3268; 154 4 Bravo, plus 310, minus 1600 244:52:53 3038; 155 - Okay. I think I'm back with you again. I blotted out on that 155 didn't I?
Long comm break.
HONEYSUCKLE [REV 147]
233:44:01 Scott: I lost you on the longitude at 154 4 Bravo.
233:44:09 Roosa: Okay. Longitude: minus 1600 244:52:53 3038; 155 4 Bravo, plus 239, minus 1594 246:35:09 3337; 156 Charlie, Charlie, plus 122, minus 1640 248:11:25 3083. Your pitch and yaw trim: minus 0.64, yaw minus 0.94 period. End of update.
233:45:39 Scott: Okay. Gee, I didn't know we were going to go that far, but here you go: 148 1 Bravo, plus 256, minus 0640 233:53:37 4046. 149 1 Charlie, plus 314 minus 0680 235:30:22 3635; 150 2 Bravo, plus 270, minus 0310 237:27:07 3159 ; 151 1 Charlie, plus 309, minus 0670 238:51:15 3033; 152 2 Alpha, plus 233, minus 0680 240:32:58 3402; 153 4 Bravo, plus 336, minus 1610 243:11:54 3268; 154 4 Bravo, plus 310, minus 1600 244:52:53 3038; 155 4 Bravo, plus 239, minus 1594 246:35:09 3337; 156 Charlie, Charlie, plus 122, minus 1640 248:11:25 3083; with a pitch trim of minus 0.64, and a yaw trim of minus 0.94.
233:47:22 Roosa: Roger. That's correct. Stand by one.
233:47:27 Scott: Okay.
233:47:33 Roosa: And, read back is correct, Dave.
233:47:38 Scott: Alrighty.
233:47:43 Roosa: And, Since I was mean enough to wake you up with an alarm clock, I can give you some good news. The on the hour report from the Guadalcanal says there are calm seas, winds are five knots, visibility 10 miles, 3000 scattered, and there are some five foot swells with about a 10 second. And the ship is about 35 miles from the target point now.
233:48:13 McDivitt: Hey, that's a pretty good description of the kind of weather we like.
233:48:17 Roosa: Well, you put in an order, we strive to please.
233:48:21 McDivitt: You guys are absolutely outstanding.
233:48:25 Roosa: And, let me see. We still got you here for about another two minutes. The daylight darkness as shown in your Flight Plan is off. It's slipped some. I might I might update you on that, if you think that will help you any of your planning. I'll just call out the stations.
233:48:47 Scott: Okay. Let me get the Flight Plans. Just a minute.
233:49:08 Scott: Okay. Go ahead.
233:49:10 Roosa: Okay. Well, we've got you now in the night time coming across here, but you'll come out of this darkness just over Texas at about 23 - something like that. These times are just rough; I don't think you'll need these. And then you'll go back to Carnarvon darkness again right at 18; and that's at 235 plus 18 and come out over Guaymas around ... Okay. And then you'll hit back in again at 236 plus 48 over Carnarvon; come back into daylight about 237 plus 25, and then darkness again at 238 plus 20, and daylight at 238 plus 55. You probably should be realigned by then, but I'll give you the last one here. At 239:52 you'll go into darkness again and come out just before the burn at 240 about 25.
233:50:39 Roosa: And we're going to have LOS here momentarily. We'll pick you up over the Mercury - standby, I'll try to settle down here oh, in about 4 minutes.
233:50:51 Scott: Okay. Fine.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. It's setting pretty ragged at the edge of the Honeysuckle station there in the amount of static coming over air-ground. Tracking ship Mercury is about two minutes away. And this will be about an 11-minute pass across Mercury. It's likely the conversation will continue on feeding up to the crew all the necessary numbers for today's reentry program. Until this morning, the term wake-up alarm has been somewhat symbolic, or at least just a suggestion of a wake-up alarm. Generally, the crew was awake, but this morning the alarm clock was real. Spacecraft communicator, Stu Roosa, used an ordinary electric alarm clock which he plugged in by his console and held it by the mouthpiece on his head-set and keyed his transmitter and turned on the alarm. Must be some kind of a space first. Mercury in two minutes or less. Today's Flight Plan, as revised here in Mission Control, calls for the update for the deorbit maneuver and also the numbers on the entry profile to be passed to the crew over Redstone, Guaymas, and Corpus Christi, Texas pass at 235 hours, 50 minutes, that will be over the stateside pass after the one upcoming. In other words, we have 148. And at 237 hours over the Huntsville and Mercury, they are scheduled to test the Entry Monitor System, which is a display device inside the spacecraft cockpit which graphically shows the crew just exactly how the primary guidance and navigation system is performing in guiding the spacecraft through the entry profile. They will be aligning the platform - inertial platform at several points during the time down to retrofire. The retrofire clock is now showing 6 hours, 30 minutes remaining until the entry maneuver. Ignition time is presently 240 hours, 31 minutes, 16.5 seconds; but as additional accurate tracking over the stateside passes comes in, the Retrofire officer likely will change these numbers back and forth several times before they settle down. These changes will not be more than a few seconds one way or the other. And, as mentioned by Stu Roosa in his conversation with the crew over the Honeysuckle, the prime recovery ship Guadalcanal is almost on station, perhaps a couple of hours steaming time out of the prime landing point, at 152-1. Standing by for Mercury conversation. Roosa's studying the acquisition tables, has his transmitter keyed, should be going on the air momentarily.
Comm break.
MERCURY [REV 147 ]
233:56:37 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston through Mercury.
233:56:41 Scott: Roger, Houston. We have you. Go.
233:56:44 Roosa: Okay. We'd like to have inverter 3, Off.
233:56:49 Scott: Roger. Inverter 3, Off, now.
233:56:52 Roosa: And also, just to get squared away here in plenty of time, we'd like to ask you the question about two-jet versus four-jet on the burn. The two-jet would save around [garble] pounds per quad, or about [garble] don't for can't understand.
233:57:21 McDivitt: How much fuel do we have? We have quite a bit of fuel extra, don't we?
233:57:27 Roosa: You're right on the red lines now, Jim. It's - It's right there. This is quad Charlie. Quad Charlie is right on the red lines, as you can see. We passed 33, and 34 is the DAP red line. But you know, this is within the gauging uncertainty, and so forth and so on and that's...
233:57:55 Scott: Okay. B and D are well up, aren't they?
233:58:03 McDivitt: We'll do a two-jet, then, Stu
233:58:06 Roosa: Okay. You'd like to do a two-jet, then?
233:58:10 McDivitt: Yes. We'll do an 18-second two-jet on - what? B and D, I guess.
233:58:15 Roosa: Roger, Jim. We concur with that.
233:58:18 McDivitt: Okay. Thank you.
233:58:20 Roosa: Thank you.
233:58:28 McDivitt: Hey, Stu, why didn't we get a drop in pressure, and all that stuff? Is there any - Do the guys on the ground think that maybe we have the secondary propellant fuel pressures Open on quad C?
233:58:44 Roosa: That appears to be a good possibility; as we told you, it should have opened up. There's a plus or minus 6 percent on that doggone estimate. So you - but still yet we should be down below that. And so, the feeling here is, it's quite possible that that secondary valve is open.
233:59:13 McDivitt: Okay.
233:59:18 Roosa: We did a lot of talking about that here this morning, And you know, we had those funnies on that separation. And we're - we're just not real sure.
233:59:31 McDivitt: Yes. That's sort of what I was thinking of too. Hey, have you done anything - any new information on our DAP here?
233:59:45 Roosa: No, We sure haven't. You know, to get us squared away down here, to make sure we're reading right, could you give us a Verb 46 enter?
233:59:56 McDivitt: Okay. I'll proceed out of the Verb 48; Then we'll give you Verb 46. Okay. Here comes the Verb 46 now.
234:00:12 Roosa: Okay.
234:00:24 Roosa: Okay. That got us squared away, Jim, And we show the DAP in good shape.
234:00:31 McDivitt: You mean the DAP really was running, then?
234:00:33 Roosa: All our data showed it was; yes.
234:00:39 McDivitt: I'll be darned. We got three-way verification on that one last night, but maybe it didn't get in.
234:00:48 Roosa: Roger. Copy.
234:01:32 Scott: Hey, Stu
234:01:34 Roosa: Go ahead, Dave,
234:01:36 Scott: Yes, we just decided to have a 6-I verification on the DAP. You want to add two?
234:01:42 Roosa: Okay.
Comm break.
234:03:26 Roosa: Okay. Apollo 9, Houston. I have you for another couple of minutes. Before I lose you here at Mercury, I guess I can cover a couple of changes that we'd like in the Flight Plan.
234:03:37 Scott: Okay. Stand by. [Garble.]
234:03:43 Scott: And by the way, you want to come off the H2 fan 2?
234:03:50 Roosa: Stand by
234:03:58 Roosa: That's negative. We do not want it Off, we'll leave it just like it is.
234:04:03 Scott: Okay. Go with your changes and I've got a question for you after you get through.
234:04:07 Roosa: Okay. Why don't you go ahead and ask it, Dave?. We're going to lose you probably in about a minute and and a half and I can cover those changes when we see you over Texas at 20.
234:04:16 Scott: Okay. Do you want to activate the primary boiler? And, if so, do you want to reservice first? And, we've talked it over decided we think it's a good idea to cold soak before we come down. What do you think?
234:04:30 Roosa: Roger. Copy two questions. One is whether you want to reservice the primary boiler before you activate it, and you have decided you'd like to cold soak. We'll try to give you a recommendation on that.
234:04:42 Scott: Okay. Fine.
234:05:13 Roosa: And, we're approaching LOS here, troops. We'll see you about 20.
234:05:21 Scott: Roger. 20.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We've had Loss of Signal out of tracking ship Mercury. At this time between bites of breakfast, the crew should be powering up the spacecraft systems; primarily the Inertial Measurement Unit, Command Module Computer and the Stabilization and Control System. And during the next revolution, from now on through the end of this revolution essentially and the beginning of the next, they'll be conducting system verifications and testing to make sure that all the systems are tuned up properly for the job of bringing the spacecraft into the prime landing area. Be coming up on Texas tracking station 19 minutes past the hour. We're overlapping coverages Texas, MILA, Antigua, Bermuda, Vanguard, Canary Islands, Madrid ending at 40 - would you believe I can't read the display - looks like 44 minutes past the hour. And at 234 hours, 07 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 234 hours, 19 minutes GET. Standing by here for the resumption of conversation between the spacecraft communicator Stu Roosa and the crew of Apollo 9. Now nearing the end of the 147th revolution, and as it crosses 80 degrees west longitude, we'll begin revolution 148. That acquisition at Texas, or at least what the little spacecraft on the wall map showed when it changed colors. Standing by here for the call from Roosa to Apollo 9. This combined stateside pass over Texas, MILA, and so on through Madrid will run about 25 minutes. Roosa is getting all ready here to begin talking.
Comm break.
TEXAS [REV 148]
234:20:27 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. We have you in good lock.
234:20:32 Scott: Roger. Houston, Apollo 9. We are still here.
234:20:39 Roosa: Very good. And on your questions, we concur with the cold soak. On the water boiler, we say do not reservice it prior to bringing it up. The reason for this is, we are not sure how much water is in there, and we would like to go ahead and bring it up and see whether it will dry out. It should dry out in the first daylight passes, and we'll be looking at it.
234:21:06 Scott: Okay. So you want us to bring it up right now?
234:21:09 Roosa: That's affirmative. Let's bring - go ahead and bring it on the line.
234:21:11 Scott: Alrighty. Here we go.
234:22:00 Scott: Hey, Houston, 9. Do you have one of those handy dandy map updates around?
234:22:07 Roosa: Roger. Standby one, here. While I'm trying to locate that ditty, I'd like to pass up a couple of changes to you.
234:22:16 Scott: Okay. Stand by a second.
234:23:01 Schweickart: Okay. Go with your changes, Stu.
234:23:04 Roosa: Okay. On your CO2 filter change at 236, or at - The second line, should read 8 to B, reuse 20 to B6.
234:23:27 Schweickart: Roger. Understand 8 to B and reuse 20 to B6.
234:23:33 Roosa: Okay, period now with the addition of the other rev, there is a lot of changes, such as the time you do the star check and all that, which I really don't think you need. But I've got them all written out here, and the times, if you'd like to take that.
234:23:50 Schweickart: No. I think what we're going to do is get the IMU up, and on the next rev do a P51 and get it all squared away. And then, the night side pass before the deorbit burn, we're going to get to the burn attitude early and make sure we get a good solid star check, because the horizon probably won't be too good just prior to the retro.
234:24:08 Roosa: Okay. Real good. As to most of the Flight Plan changes I have here, they are just reflecting changes in daylight and dark and the addition of the Rev; so, that's really, I believe, all you need to change on your Flight Plan this time. And we do have a couple of, would you believe, changes to the entry checklist I'd like to talk to you about.
234:24:31 Schweickart: Well, I believe that. You've had about 10 days, and I'd be surprised if you didn't have any changes.
234:24:37 Roosa: Okay. And I found my map update sheet here, if you want to take that too,
234:24:45 Schweickart: Okay. Go with the map update, and we'll dig out the entry checklist in the meantime.
234:24:50 Roosa: Okay. Rev 147, which is completing, 234:15:36; longitude one, 107 west
234:25:07 Schweickart: Roger. 234:15:36; 107 west. Right?
234:25:49 Schweickart: Okay. Go ahead with the entry checklist, Stu.
234:25:52 Roosa: Okay. Let's start here on page E1 dash one.
Comm break.
234:27:02 Schweickart: All right.
234:27:04 Roosa: Okay. The first one - these are out now, but I'll just toss in the reminder - the very first line on panel 8, your heater gauging circuit breakers main A and main B, we want those open.
234:27:23 Schweickart: Okay. Got that.
234:27:25 Roosa: Okay, now you're still under the SCS, the next to last line, auto RCS select, the checklist is showing 16 Main B. We'd recommend the Command Module 1. Main A comma, Command Module 2. Main B, and A/C roll. Main B.
234:28:05 Schweickart: Okay. I guess that's a must first. We'll do that.
234:28:10 Roosa: All right. And now, on page E1-C, right at the top right under C, you can just delete the stir the tanks.
234:28:29 Schweickart: Okay. Just delete Step C. Is that right?
234:28:32 Roosa: That's affirmative. Delete step Charlie.
234:28:36 Schweickart: Okay. Go ahead.
234:28:39 Roosa: Alright. On page E1 13/14.
234:28:47 Schweickart: Go.
234:28:49 Roosa: Okay. Here, the third line down, the SCS logic 2 on up: We'd like to have that moved just above the MSFN confirmed Go for Pyro Arm. And essentially, what we're trying to do here, is make sure that you have your ELS to auto, ELS logic on - then, when you throw the SCS logic, we know we're all squared away to give you a Go.
234:29:18 Schweickart: Okay, Houston. Understand. It'll read CB Sequential Arm, 2, Close, ELS Auto and ELS Logic, On, and then, Sequential Logic, 2, On up.
234:29:24 Schweickart: Okay. 10102. Go ahead.
234:29:27 Roosa: Okay. On page E2-3.
234:29:28 Roosa: That's affirmative. Jolly good on that one period. Now on page E2-1.
234:29:39 Schweickart: Okay. Go.
234:29:41 Roosa: And this, I know you're well aware of. I'm just tossing it in with our decision to go wth the two-jet ullage: that Register 1 under the DAP 10102.
234:30:01 Schweickart: Go.
234:30:02 Roosa: All right. Down here at minus 30 seconds we'd like to - the first two lines there, we'd like to reverse the order of them. We'd like to have the Tape Recorder, Record high bitrate, Forward, to be first, followed by Average g, On, Up Telemetry, Command Reset and then Normal.
234:30:29 Schweickart: Okay. So it will read this way: Tape Recorder, Record high bit rate, Forward, and then Average G, On, Up Telemetry, Command Reset and then Normal.
234:30:38 Roosa: That's affirmative. And, just for your info, that's just to keep us from having to reacquire the data lock there. Okay. And now over on page E26.
234:30:54 Schweickart: Go ahead.
234:30:55 Roosa: Okay. We're showing auto RCS Select Command Module, 1, Main B. Change that to read Main A and this will agree with the configuration that we recommended over on the first page.
234:31:13 Schweickart: Okay. So it will read auto RCS select CM 1 Main A.
234:31:19 Roosa: That is affirmative.
234:31:24 Schweickart: Go ahead.
234:31:25 Roosa: Okay. That's all I have.
234:31:29 Schweickart: Gee. That's not bad at all.
234:31:31 Roosa: Very good.
234:31:34 Schweickart: Okay. Well, I guess everything else is squared away on that. We went through it last night, and we don't have any questions on it. So if you see anything else, you can give a whistle.
234:31:43 Roosa: Okay. We sure will.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. It sounds like the crew of Apollo 9 will get back to their breakfast now, after getting an update to the entry checklist from spacecraft communicator Stu Roosa. However, there's still almost 20 minutes remaining in the pass across the States, tracking ship Vanguard, Canary Islands, and Madrid. We'll leave the circuit open for any conversation that might take place.
This is Apollo Control. Apollo 9 now in mid-Atlantic crossing the 40th meridian in longitude. And looks about another 15 minutes remaining until Loss of Signal at Madrid. Spacecraft communicator Stu Roosa is having an over-the-console huddle with the Flight Activities Officer. We will leave the circuit open for any further conversation during the stateside pass.
Comm break.
VANGUARD [REV 148 ]
234:38:24 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, Houston. I was a little surprised asking for that map update. Are you all going to be taking any pictures this morning?
234:38:31 McDivitt: Say, listen. We're the world's greatest spectators.
234:38:35 Roosa: Okay. Are you going to have your cameras out at all this morning, Jim?
234:38:40 McDivitt: No, We really don't have much in the way of film left, Stu. We've got about 15 frames on the Hasselblad left and we've got about - oh, I think we have three film packs with 16mm, and have about a quarter of a roll left on them. We do plan on taking pictures of the re entry. We have one full roll of 16mm reserved for that.
234:39:06 Roosa: Okay. The reason why I asked you, we've got a SVM[?] in here from Australia, requesting some specific pictures, and I wasn't even going to mention it to you. I thought on re-entry day you wouldn't be interested. But if you've got a camera out coming across Australia, why, there's some people down there want some pictures.
234:39:21 McDivitt: That's okay. We've been trying to get a picture of Australia, too. When are we going to go across?
234:39:27 Roosa: Well, let me check my terminator here. I think you're going to be in darkness, but, Perth - in regards to your comment the other night - Perth wanted some pictures of their lights.
234:39:41 McDivitt: Okay. We'll see what we can do here. Give us the time.
234:39:45 Roosa: Roger. Will do.
Comm break.
234:40:51 Roosa: OK, Jim. For the picture of Perth - you might bring up your S-band volume, here, two. We'll be going over to Madrid.
MADRID [REV 148 ]
234:41:06 Scott: Go ahead with the times, Stu...
234:41:07 McDivitt: ...ahead, Stu. We're here.
234:41:08 Roosa: Okay. We don't have your time, now, period to get Perth, It's going to be two revs from now, and the best time it's putting you is up at about 238 plus 12, which looks like it's getting up toward the busy section.
234:41:24 McDivitt: Okay. We'll write it down on the Flight Plan. If we can get it, we'll try to get it.
234:41:29 Roosa: Okay. Let me give you the exact time, here, for Perth. It'll be 236 plus 27 plus 38. That's your closest approach.
234:41:44 Scott: Okay. Will they be north or south of track?
234:41:48 Roosa: You'll be just about over them. You'll have about an 82 degree angle on them, so you'll be coming right over in about 226 miles.
234:41:58 Scott: Okay.
Comm break.
234:43:08 Roosa: Okay. Apollo 9. We've got about a minute here, I believe, off of Madrid. Can you give us a crew status report? If not, we'll catch you at Carnarvon at 11.
234:43:22 McDivitt: This is the Commander. I had about six hours of good sleep. About one hour of poor sleep, And I took one Actifed.
234:43:29 Scott: I had some - CMP - and I had about 7½ hours of good sleep and - no; I had a vitamin pill yesterday.
234:43:37 McDivitt: And I had a vitamin pill, too.
234:43:42 Roosa: Roger. I copy both.
234:43:47 Schweickart: Rusty had 8 hours of good sleep, one Seconal, one Actifed, and one vitamin pill.
234:43:54 Roosa: Roger. Understand. Thank you very much.
Comm break.
And this is Apollo Control. Apparently we have had Loss of Signal through Madrid tracking station. Toward the end of that pass the crew passed up their sleep and pill report. Commander Jim McDivitt had what he described as 6 hours of good sleep and 1 hour of poor sleep, 1 vitamin pill. Command Module Pilot Dave Scott had 7½ hours sleep, took 1 vitamin pill. Lunar Module Pilot Rusty Schweickart had 8 hours of sleep, took 1 seconal, 1 actifed, and 1 vitamin pill. Also over the Canary Island station target of opportunity was passed up to the crew for a picture. At 238 hours, 25 minutes over Perth, Australia. Apparently the citizens of Perth are going to incur another big light bill. They've requested that a photo be made of the city with all the lights on. Perth in the past has served as sort of a beacon to orbiting space travelers. Several missions in the past in Mercury and Gemini they've purposely turned on all their lights. Perth is approximately midway of around the earth from Cape Kennedy and at the low point of the orbit as it swings down in the southern hemisphere. Coming up on Carnarvon and the next station at 10 minutes past the hour, Apollo 9 is over Central Africa, the Sahara Desert. Just begun revolution 148 at ...
This is Apollo Control, 235 hours 10 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Carnarvon acquisition in about 20 seconds. Meanwhile, the space flight meteorology group of the ESSA weather bureau here in Mission Control headed up by Allan "Sandy" Sanderson issued a weather forecast for the prime landing area which reads "light and variable winds are forecast with seas one to two feet and swells six to eight feet; skies will be partly cloudy with temperatures near 73 degrees; weather conditions will be excellent for the end of mission landing area" which is about 300 miles north of Puerto Rico. Standing by here for the Carnarvon, Honeysuckle and Mercury pass. Carnarvon and Honeysuckle overlap for a total 18 minutes; then there's about a 1 minute, 30 second dropout to tracking ship Mercury and another 11 minutes over Mercury. After Mercury some 6 minutes after LOS comes Redstone
Comm break.
CARNARVON [REV 148 ]
235:11:26 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
235:11:35 McDivitt: Roger. Houston, Apollo 9.
235:12:08 Roosa: Read you loud and clear.
235:12:15 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9.
235:12:16 Roosa: Go ahead, Apollo 9.
235:12:19 McDivitt: What quads do you want to use for the early part of today? A and B or...
235:12:29 Roosa: Roger. Copy. Standby.
235:12:50 Roosa: Okay. Apollo 9, Houston. We are recommending that you just go ahead and use all of them for this since we won't really be using that much, and we'd like to have all four on bringing up the platform.
235:13:04 McDivitt: Okay. You'd like to have all 4 of the quads on when we bring up the platform?
235:13:08 Roosa: That is affirmative. And you can just go ahead and leave all four on with the exception of the 2-jet ullage that we've already discussed.
235:13:18 McDivitt: Okay.
This is Apollo Control. While Apollo 9 is just crossing the coast at about just north of Perth between Perth and Carnarvon, the west coast of Australia, we'll stand by to pick up any further communication between the spacecraft communicator here and the crew of Apollo 9. Meanwhile the SPAN, or Spacecraft Analysis group, here in Mission Control, has issued report for 234 hour Ground Elapsed Time on spacecraft performance.
Long comm break.
235:17:14 Roosa: Would you bring up your S-band? We'll be going over to Honeysuckle in a couple of minutes.
235:17:20 McDivitt: Okay.
Getting back to the SPAN report that's one of the shortest on record. Most of the entries say performance continues to be nominal or no change, no change, no change. This includes Manned Space Flight Network Communications, crew systems, electronic systems, propulsion and power which goes for the Service Propulsion System, Reaction Control System, batteries, fuel cells and cryogenics; all parameters and nominal. Guidance and control - no change. Structures and thermal area - no change. So it looks like even though we're about 5 hours and 13 minutes plus away from retrofire, end of the mission, the spacecraft is ready to continue for an unknown period. We'll stand by here for the balance of the Carnarvon-Honeysuckle pass and the subsequent pass over tracking ship Mercury. Looks like spacecraft communicator Ron Evans is coming in to relieve Stu Roosa at the spacecraft communicator console. These men have been working some strange hours; somewhat out of synchronization with the rest of the flight control teams. Some nine minutes remaining until Honeysuckle Loss of Signal. We'll leave the air-ground circuit open for any possible conversation the rest of this pass. That burst of noise is known as going through a keyhole.
This is Apollo Control. 5 minutes remaining in the Honeysuckle pass. Just heard a report from recovery that the ship, Guadalcanal, is now in station for landing area 152-1, ready and waiting with a 350-pound cake, which apparently has whetted the appetites of the crew of Apollo 9.
Long comm break.
HONEYSUCKLE [REV 148 ]
235:23:42 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston.
235:23:45 McDivitt: Go ahead. Houston, Apollo 9.
235:23:47 Roosa: Roger. Guadalcanal is on station and is waiting.
235:23:51 McDivitt: Very good. Thank you.
235:23:53 Roosa: Roger.
235:23:59 McDivitt: Houston, What are you talking to us through?
235:24:02 Roosa: Stand by one, and I'll see what I'm uplinking. Wait. Where through Honeysuckle; it's got to be S-band.
235:24:08 McDivitt: Okay.
235:24:25 Roosa: And, Apollo 9, Houston. Jim, Since you were so agreeable about that picture of, particularly of Perth - there, that was - the data I gave you was for Rev 150. You'll come within about 80 miles of it on the next Rev around, if you'd like to take that time, if you think it's going to be feasible.
235:24:42 McDivitt: Okay.
235:24:45 Roosa: Are you ready to copy?
235:25:40 McDivitt: We sure can see a lot of lights down on the city, down on the ground right now, Stu.
235:26:03 McDivitt: Okay. Just a second.
235:26:08 Roosa: Roger. No sweat. It will be on the next rev.
235:26:09 McDivitt: Okay. Why don't you go ahead and give us the data here; I'll write it down now.
235:26:14 Roosa: Okay. For Perth, your time of closest approach: 236 plus 51 plus 36, and Perth will be 82 miles north of track.
235:26:29 McDivitt: Okay. And what's the other one?
235:26:32 Roosa: Okay. The other one will be Brisbane: TCA, 237:00 plus 41. And it will be 110 miles north of the track.
235:26:45 Roosa: Roger. There's two cities - well, there's actually three. Sydney will be about 228 miles off your track the next time around, but Perth and Brisbane both are - Perth will be 80 and Brisbane 110, and sure like to get some pictures of those, if you can work it in.
235:26:53 McDivitt: Okay. Very good. We'll try to get them.
235:26:55 Roosa: Okay. And I don't know whether you can reach out 220 miles or not, but if you've got your camera out, I might as well give you one for Sydney, and that will wipe us out.
235:27:03 McDivitt: Okay. Go ahead.
235:27:04 Roosa: All right. Sydney: TCA, 236 plus 59 plus 37. And Sydney will be 228 miles south of track.
235:27:18 McDivitt: Okay. We'll have two north and one south. Is that correct?
235:27:20 Roosa: That is affirmative. And you'll hit Perth first, of course. By the time - we're going to leave here at the Honeysuckle; see you over the Mercury around 31.
235:27:30 McDivitt: Okay.
This is Apollo Control. We have had apparently Loss of Signal out of tracking station at Honeysuckle.
235:28:03 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9.
235:28:10 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
235:28:19 Roosa: You're over the hill, I believe.
Apollo 9 did make one attempt to call back to Houston right at Loss of Signal at Honeysuckle. However, in about 1 minute and a half we should have acquisition through tracking ship Mercury. We'll leave the circuit up for resumption of conversation between the spacecraft communicators here in Mission Control and the crew of Apollo 9.
Comm break.
MERCURY [REV 148]
235:30:54 Schweickart: Houston, Apollo 9.
235:31:01 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
235:31:04 Schweickart: Roger. Would you tell the good people of Sydney that we saw their lights about five minutes ago? It was a very beautiful sight.
235:31:11 Evans: Good. Mighty fine. Thank you.
235:31:17 McDivitt: Good morning, Ron. How are you?
235:31:19 Evans: Hey, fine shape, and all set to go.
235:31:22 McDivitt: Very good. Thank you.
235:31:26 Scott: Where are you going, Ron?
235:31:30 Evans: Hey, that's a good question, come to think of it.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, some 8 minutes remaining on the tracking ship Mercury pass. Continuing to stand by as the spacecraft communicator Ron Evans is taking over for Stu Roosa. We'll resume conversation with the crew of Apollo 9.
This is Apollo Control, some 5 minutes remaining in the Redstone pass. After Redstone LOS there will be - as you were - a Mercury pass, some 4 minutes remaining after Mercury LOS, we'll be some 6 minutes out of tracking ship Redstone, which will be a very low elevation angle pass of about 1½ degrees. So it appears that Guaymas will be the first station of which the conversation will resume. We'll leave the air to ground circuit open and monitor any further conversation on the air to ground.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, about a minute away from...
235:40:51 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. About LOS; will pick you up at Redstone.
235:40:57 McDivitt: Roger.
This is Apollo Control. About a minute away from...
235:41:35 Scott: Houston, you got enough to get the gyro torquing angles, or did you copy them?
235:41:41 Evans: No, we missed them.
235:41:43 McDivitt: Do you want to read them?
235:41:46 Evans: Affirmative. Go.
235:41:48 McDivitt: OK. [Garble] was 235:34:00, minus 00128, minus 00781, plus...
This is Apollo Control. We're still a few seconds away from Mercury Loss of Signal but apparently there will be no other contact with the crew of Apollo 9 through Mercury. So at this time we'll take the line down.
This is Apollo Control. An attempt was made to pass down some numbers to spacecraft communicator from the crew as they went over the hill at Mercury. These were torquing angles on a recent IMU alignment apparently. And the breakup there was caused according to the network controller by loss of lock of the tracking ship Mercury's Comsat relay antenna. We'll pick up tracking ship Redstone at 47 minutes past the hour, some 5 minutes from now. And at 235 hours, 42 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 235 hours, 48 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Should be in acquisition now according to the station tables on the displays in front of the control room here, with the tracking ship Redstone, which is about midway between Hawaii and the west coast of North America. Stand by for any conversation that might take place during this pass over the States. Continuous coverage. Redstone, Guaymas, Texas, MILA, Grand Bahama, Bermuda, Antigua, Vanguard tracking ship in mid-Atlantic, Canary Islands, Madrid. All of this overlapping coverage lasts until 17 minutes past the hour. Which looks to be about a total of 30 minutes. Ron Evans has replaced Stu Roosa as spacecraft communicator. Roosa has removed his head set, is taking a stretch and munching on a sandwich.

235:49:59 Scott: Okay. Did you copy what type alignment it was?
235:50:03 Evans: Negative.
235:50:05 Scott: Okay. We did a nominal to time 240:30:08 in order to get the platform up into place.

236:11:32 McDivitt: Okay. That's what I thought. We just wanted to make sure that we got the right ones going in the right place because, surprisingly enough, the CO2 canisters were not marked for the flight.
236:11:43 Evans: Roger. Copy.
236:11:55 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. I have a comment for your entry update.
This is Apollo Control. Apollo 9 is nearing the end of the 148th revolution and shortly will cross directly over Mexico City. Monitoring the air-ground circuit for this stateside pass during which is scheduled updates to the crew on maneuver or deorbit. Also the entry numbers, once called an entry PAD. Such thing as bank angles, time to reverse bank, retro elapse time to begin blackout, end blackout, drogue deploy and main parachute deploy and so forth. We'll stand by with the circuit open to monitor any conversation during this first of about 3 more stateside passes until re-entry.
This is Apollo Control. Flight surgeon Ken Beers is closely monitoring the heart rate and respiration rate.

CANARY [REV 149 ]
236:12:49 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Canaries.
236:12:53 McDivitt: Roger. How do you read now?
236:12:54 Evans: Roger. Loud and clear. Your comment for your entry update. There is: You put the 31.4 degree window mark on the horizon at 0.05g.
236:13:20 McDivitt: Okay. Understand the 31.4 degree line on the window on the horizon at 0.05g.
236:13:24 Evans: Roger and you will lose your sextant star at 240 plus 16 plus 53.
236:13:39 Scott: Understand. We lose the sextant star at 240:16:53.
236:13:45 Evans: Affirmative.
This is Apollo Control. Some 3 minutes remaining until Canaries Loss of Signal. We'll continue to monitor until LOS at Canaries for any further conversation.
This is Apollo Control. We've passed the time at which we should have had Loss of Signal out of Canary Islands. Now to recap the barrage of numbers that was fired at the crew of Apollo 9; on the maneuver update, the crew was given the ignition time for the SPS burn number 8 our deorbit maneuver: 260 hours, 31 minutes, 13.78 seconds. Total Delta V or velocity change in retrograde 325 feet per second, burn time: 11.6 seconds, Command and Service Module weight before the maneuver, 24,880 pounds; then they were given a navigation star for onboard use with the Apollo sextant, star number 15 which in the Apollo list of stars is Sirius in the constellation, Greater Dog, in the south celestial sphere. The star is also known as the Dog Star. Then the entry update included the - all the times after the maneuver, in which various events occur and the splash target coordinates, which were: 152-1 Alpha, 23.25 degrees north latitude, 68 degrees even west longitude, range to go after .05g or the first deceleration sensing of 1201.5 nautical miles, inertial velocity at .05g 25,996 feet per second, retro elapsed time of .05g, that is, time after ignition and retrofire, retro-elapsed time .05g 15 minutes 27 seconds retro-elapsed time of .2 or 2/10ths g 16 minutes 03 seconds, the degrees for right and left bank for backup Stabilization Control System entry right: 50 degrees and left: 60 degrees. The roll right or reverse bank would be at 19 minutes 01 second, after retrofire. Begin blackout at 15 minutes 56 seconds retro-elapsed time; end blackout 19 minutes 29 seconds after retrofire; drogue chute deploy 23 minutes 46 seconds retro elapsed time; main parachutes out at 24 minutes 33 seconds retro-elapsed time. Tananarive tracking station at 32 minutes past the hour is the next station. Total time over that station is 6 minutes. We'll come back up at that time for any voice communications through that station. And at 236 hours, 23 minutes GET; this is Apollo Control.
Very long comm break.
236:25:09 McDivitt (onboard): Oh, let's see. I've got to undo that.
236:25:55 Scott (onboard): That's forward. I'll go ahead and [garble].
236:25:57 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, what do you think of [garble] E-57
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 236 hours, 32 minutes GET. Comm is up on Carnarvon - as you were - Tananarive tracking station, the Malagasy Republic, off the east coast of Africa. First pass of the day over Tananarive, we'll stand by for any possible conversation through that station, and take the circuit down if it appears there will not be any conversation. The spacecraft communicator Ron Evans is in a small huddle with some Flight Plans type around his console and may not talk to the crew through this station.
This is Apollo Control, still standing by over Tananarive. This is a 6-minute pass over the station. It doesn't appear at this time the spacecraft communicator will call the crew, however, we will continue to monitor air to ground and leave the circuit up.
This is Apollo Control, we are less than a minute away from LOS at Tananarive, and apparently there will be no attempt to contact the crew through Tananarive. Carnarvon at 16 minutes past the hour, overlapping Honeysuckle, Huntsville, Mercury. This pass appears to be 29 minutes Iong over those four stations. And at 236 hours, 38 minutes GET; this is Apollo Control.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 236 hours, 48 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We're in acquisition over the Carnarvon, Australia tracking station. Standing by for conversation out of Mission Control with the crew of Apollo 9. EECOM just reported to Flight that the primary evaporator just came on the line in the spacecraft. Primary evaporator removes heat from the systems as a sort of backup to the space radiators which are back in the Service Module. Boils water to dump heat over board.

CARNARVON [REV 149 ]
236:49:12 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon.
236:49:16 Scott: Roger, Houston. Go.
236:49:18 Evans: Roger, Dave. We are not getting any EKG on you. If it's something real simple, fine; otherwise, we'll just get by with your respiration.
236:49:30 Scott: Okay. I'll give it a quick check.
This is Apollo Control. The crew of Apollo 9 should at this time be able to see the lights of Perth, Australia. The people of Perth have, are building up a large light bill again. They're just after sundown at this time in Australia or at Perth. Apollo 9 is midway through revolution 149. Turning on the lights at Perth seems to be somewhat of a tradition. Continuing to monitor the air to ground circuit over Carnarvon. Honeysuckle, Huntsville and Redstone are as, over Mercury that is ... der until LO...
Comm break.
236:52:38 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Looks like you fixed the EKG, there.
236:53:06 Scott: Say again.
236:53:08 Evans: Roger. It looks like your EKG is good, now.
236:53:12 Scott: Oh, okay. It was a loose connector.
236:53:17 Evans: Roger.
This is Apollo Control. While waiting for conversation to resume we might recap here the times for the retrofire maneuver at splash time. Ignition for SPS burn number 8, retrofire deorbit burn is now Ground Elapsed Time of 240 hours, 31 minutes, 14 seconds - or 10:31:14 CST. Splashdown anticipated at Ground Elapsed Time 240 hours, - standby - 29 minutes, 29 seconds thereafter which would be 241:00:43 or 11am and 43 seconds. Continuing to monitor the Carnarvon-Honeysuckle-Huntsville-Mercury pass.

236:55:08 Scott: Roger. S-band up for Honeysuckle.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. Apollo 9 is crossing the southern Australian coast at about Adelaide just north of Melbourne. We're continuing to monitor the air-ground circuit for two-way communications over these stations and we'll leave the line open until Loss of Signal at Mercury.
Apollo Control here. Apparently the lack of conversation is due to the fact that the crew at this time is scheduled to do a Program 52 - inertial measurement realignment at this time followed by a test of the Entry Monitoring System. We'll leave the circuit up to monitor any possible air-to-ground during this pass.
Long comm break.
237:06:47 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
237:06:49 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
237:06:56 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Go. We read you.
237:07:09 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
237:07:12 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
237:07:15 Scott: Roger. Did you get the gyro torquing angles?
237:07:18 Evans: Negative. You went over the hill just before we got them.
237:07:22 Scott: Okay. GET of 237:05:30. Minus 00.395, minus 00.223, plus 00.534. And that's to the desired REFSMMAT that you sent up.

MERCURY [REV 149 ]
237:09:14 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9.
237:09:16 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Roger.
237:09:20 McDivitt: Did you want an E memory dump today?
237:09:23 Evans: That's affirmative. Standby, and I'll give you a time on it.
237:09:27 McDivitt: Okay.
Comm break.
237:10:30 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
237:10:33 McDivitt: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 9.
237:10:34 Evans: Roger. The computer was powered up all night, So I guess we don't need E mem - E mod dump.
237:10:40 McDivitt: Okay. Very good.
Comm break.
237:12:01 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9.
237:12:03 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
237:12:10 McDivitt: Houston, We were doing a DSKY lamp test there, and I hit a reset at the end of the thing; got a 212 Alarm, which in our book says PIPA failed or PIPA not being used. Says do a PIPA bias check. What do you think about that?
237:12:35 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. I think that's the same thing we saw the other night when you did that, and we think it's normal, but stand by one.
237:12:45 McDivitt: Okay.
237:12:50 Evans: And, 9, Houston. We are getting bias checks down here anyhow, so PIPA bias check not necessary.
237:12:59 McDivitt: Okay. I think - but you understand the question? We got a 212 alarm, and I guess you can see it on the DSKY as well as we can, so okay.
237:13:08 Evans: Affirmative. We understand.
237:13:11 Scott: Alrighty.
237:14:09 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
237:14:12 Scott: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 9.
237:14:15 Evans: Roger. We're sure that's a normal thing. It's the power supply that gets interrupted when you do that DSKY check, and all you have to do now is hit Error Reset.
237:14:26 McDivitt: Good. We're very good at that Error Reset.
Comm break.
237:15:29 Evans: Okay.
237:15:36 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. We'll pick you up at Redstone at 20.
237:15:42 McDivitt: Roger. Redstone at 20.
This is Apollo Control. We have had Loss of Signal over the tracking ship Mercury, coming up on Redstone at 19 minutes past the hour, in about 3 minutes, for a fairly long pass over Redstone, Guaymas, Texas, Grand Bahama, Antigua, tracking ship Vanguard, Canary Islands, about ¾ of the way through revolution 149. And at 237 hours, 16 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 237 hours, 19 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Some 50 seconds now to the tracking Ship Redstone; this pass all the way through to Canary Islands station will end at 54 minutes past the hour. Almost 35 minutes of total tracking and communications pass - thank you. Spacecraft communicator Ron Evans passing out miniature American flags with a toothpick for a staff; flags are about an inch by an inch and a half. Everyone is propping them up on the tops of the consoles. We've had acquisition at the Redstone; standing by for conversation to resume.
After this morning's alarm clock episode, one wonders whether the alarm clock will become part of the standard equipment in the Mission Control Center here. Given a choice, I think soothing music would be more apropos to wake up than the jangle or buzz of an alarm clock. It was eyes left here for a few moments as a rather attractive young lady from the flight surgeon's staff support room came into the room briefly, and then back to business. Continuing to stand by here for air to ground communications to Apollo 9. 34 minutes total duration over this stateside Canary Island pass.
This is Apollo Control. Still standing by over tracking ship Redstone for the stateside pass. Countdown clocks are showing 3 hours, 5 minutes until ignition of SPS burn number 8, deorbit burn; and 3 hours, 34 minutes until splash. Crew of Apollo 9 at this time, according to the Flight Plan, is completing final entry preparations and during this next revolution over Australia, plans to - or attempt to take photos of the city of Perth, with all the lights on. On the next rev, over Pretoria and Tananarive and Africa, they'll maneuver to the deorbit attitude, that is with the blunt end forward, or engine nozzle toward the direction of flight, and pitch down 31.7 degrees below the horizon. At this time they will conduct the star check through the sextant; the star being Sirius, the Dog Star, and over Carnarvon the following tasks; they'll get a Go from Mission Control Center here for the deorbit burn, which now is scheduled for 140 [sic] hours, 31 minutes, 14 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. We'll continue to monitor air to ground here for this stateside pass; there's a sparse amount of conversation that's taken place so far. Likely it will be busier in the succeeding revolution as we get nearer entry. Apollo Control monitoring air to ground.
This is Apollo Control. Apollo 9 is crossing the Gulf of Lower California and is approximately directly over the tracking station at Guaymas, Mexico. Air to ground circuit is still open, monitoring this stateside pass.
This is Apollo Control. This is one of the quietest stateside passes in memory except when the crew has been asleep. They have just begun revolution 150 as they cross the longitude of Cape Kennedy from whence the mission started some 10 days ago. Clock now showing 2 hours, 53 minutes until retrofire; 3 hours, 23 minutes...
REDSTONE [REV 149 ]
237:23:37 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
237:23:40 McDivitt: Go ahead, Houston.
237:23:41 Evans: Roger. We still have the secondary loop coming on the line, and will have you until about 54.
237:23:47 McDivitt: Okay. Very good.
Very long comm break.
237:37:32 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9. We've opened all. Did you see any change of state in anything on the ground?
GUAYMAS [REV 150 ]
237:37:42 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9. Do you read?
237:37:44 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Affirmative. Go.
237:37:46 McDivitt: Okay. We are going to open our secondary propellant fuel pressure valves in the Service Module RCS, now.
237:37:52 Evans: Roger. Go ahead.
The crew of Apollo 9 reported that they were going to go to the secondary SPS [means RCS] propellant tanks, or so-called Volkswagen tanks.
237:38:39 Evans: Negative. No change down here; which is good.
237:38:43 McDivitt: Yes.
Very long comm break.
237:53:00 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Anout one minute LOS; Tananarive at 07 Sunset will be at 20.
237:53:06 McDivitt: Roger. Thank you.
237:53:43 Scott (onboard): [Garble] clockwise [garble].
This is Apollo Control. Some 19 minutes remaining until Loss of Signal at Canaries. The air to ground circuit will be left up for the duration of this pass to pick up any possible conversation, although neither end of the circuit is very talkative at the moment.
This is Apollo Control. Apollo 9 is now out over the tracking ship Vanguard in the mid-Atlantic with some 13 minutes remaining until Loss of Signal out at Canaries. The spacecraft has just begun revolution 150. Continuing to monitor air to ground circuit.
237:55:13 Scott (onboard): [Garble] just punched the warning light on. I guess. power [garble].
237:55:46 Scott (onboard): [Garble]
237:55:50 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble] supervise [garble].
237:55:59 Scott (onboard): Oh, no.
This is Apollo Control. Some 7 minutes remaining in this pass until Canary Loss of Signal. Among the sights in the Mission Operations Control Room here is a large half-eaten jar of kosher dill pickles from a delicatessen type snack that was had in the control room last night during the Gold Team shift. Continuing to monitor air-ground all the way through Canary Loss of Signal. Lots of dead air this pass. That likely won't be true for the next two passes over the States.
This is Apollo Control. Recovery room plot now shows the Guadalcanal, landing platform helicopter ship, on station at the 152 dash 1 Alpha target point. Weather forecast showing visibility 10 miles; winds variable to light; variable direction in light speed; wave height 2 to 3 feet. The Service Module impact point is predicted uprange of the spacecraft target point. It looks like about 140 nautical miles. Some four minutes left now in the Canary Island pass until Loss of Signal. We'll stay with the air-ground circuit until Loss of Signal at Canary and pick up again for possible communications through Tananarive and certainly at Carnarvon.
This is Apollo Control. The Flight Dynamics Officer display, which shows a lot of numbers about the spacecraft's orbital shape and so on, now shows the spacecraft with a perigee of 98.1 nautical miles and apogee at 242.5. Present tracking shows that the spacecraft is very near perigee. Inertial velocity at this time is 25,815 feet per second [7,868 m/s]. Spacecraft is calculated to weigh 24,888 pounds [11,289 kg]. Some two minutes remaining until Canary Islands Loss of Signal. We'll stay with the circuit until that time.
This is Apollo Control. Apparently, that does conclude any contact during this stateside pass. The crew at this time is likely quite busy storing away all the gear in the spacecraft getting the spacecraft cleaned up from a housekeeping standpoint. All loose items stowed. All the systems ready for the entry - which according to the countdown clock will come at 2 minutes and 37 seconds from now with ignition of Service Propulsion System burn number 8; followed by splashdown at 3 hours and 6 minutes from now. And at 237 hours, 54 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
Long comm break.
TANANARIVE [REV 150 ]
This is Apollo Control at 238 hours, 6 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, coming up on Tananarive. Just had acquisition and we'll stand by for any conversation through that station. During the 10 days of this mission, the crew of Apollo 9 have flown the spacecraft in approximately seven different combinations, starting out at orbital insertion when the Command and Service Module and the Lunar Module were all still attached to the S-IVB third stage of the launch vehicle. Then at separation when they did their turnaround to dock with the Lunar Module, it was Command and Service Module only. After docking with the Lunar Module and extraction from the S-IVB, it vas Command and Service Module and Lunar Module combination. During the rendezvous sequence, McDivitt and Scott [sic] were in the Lunar Module flying it out almost 200 nautical miles away from the Command Module. Then after jettisoning the descent stage right at the coelliptic sequence maneuver of the rendezvous, they had the ascent stage only manned. After rendezvous was complete and redocking with the Command and Service Module, there was a combination of the Command and Service Module and the ascent stage docked. The ascent stage was then jettisoned and yet another combination - actually a repeat of the Command and Service Module only - was flown for the last 5 days of the mission. And in about 2 hours and 22 minutes from now, after the deorbit burn, the Service Module will be jettisoned and the last of the combinations will be flown; that is, the Command Module only all the way through to splash point. Monitoring the air-ground now for any possible conversation through that station at Tananarive in the Malagasy Republic. It's unlikely there will be any conversation. Spacecraft Communicator Ron Evans does not appear to be readying a call but just in case we will leave the circuit open.

238:09:35 Evans: Roger. If you turn H2 tank 2 fan, On, that may pump up the pressure in the H2 tanks, there.
238:09:46 McDivitt: Okay. You want the fan, On in H2 tank 1?
238:09:52 Evans: Tank 1 and tank 2.
238:09:57 Scott: Okay. Tanks 1 and 2 fans, On.
238:10:01 Evans: Roger.

238:21:26 Scott (onboard): An hour and 11 minutes, we're off about 4 degrees in roll; that's about - oh, about - 2 degrees in pitch; and it's off simply nothing in yaw.
238:21:39 McDivitt (onboard): Sounds like that is pretty good. [Garble] must have drifted back in again [garble]. [Laughter.]
238:21:44 Scott (onboard): [Garble] frankly.
238:21:45 McDivitt (onboard): Sure, it was off more than that in [garble] like [garble] more than normal in pitch [garble].
This is Apollo Control; 238 hours, 22 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. In acquisition at Carnarvon, Australia - standing by for resumption of any communications through Carnarvon. We'll have continuous coverage from Carnarvon through Honeysuckle and tracking ship Huntsville for approximately 26 minutes until 48 minutes past the hour.

CARNARVON [REV 150 ]
238:23:51 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon.
238:23:56 McDivitt: Hello, Houston. Apollo 9, here. We are just doing our star attitude check at this time, and we are going to follow that up with the last P52 to REFSMMAT. We're standing by at the 1-hour point on our checklist.
238:24:11 Evans: Roger. We copy. Tell Dave to watch out for a flare from Perth at 26, and don't mistake it for his sextant star, there.
238:24:22 McDivitt: Okay.
238:24:51 McDivitt: Houston, which direction is Perth from our track? North or south?
238:24:59 Evans: Roger. It should be 28 miles north.

238:27:22 Evans: I've got an oddball COAS star there, if Jim wants to look at it,
238:27:29 Scott: Okay. What is it?
238:27:34 Evans: Roger. It's - I can't even pronounce it P-Y-X-I-D-I-S [means Alpha Pyxidis] But it's a 4th magnitude star closest to Regor, on a line between Regor and Alphard.
238:27:52 Evans: And it should...

238:30:38 Evans: Hey, beautiful. You guys are getting pretty good up there.
238:30:43 McDivitt: Well, we want to go out with a flash, here.
238:30:44 Scott: I'm going to hang it up right now.
238:30:47 Evans: Okay.
That comment from the crew that they were setting an all zeroes reading was confirmed here on the ground by telemetry and this indicates that the alignment of the Inertial Measurement Unit is perfect. We are standing by for the balance of this pass over Carnarvon and Honeysuckle, continuing over to the tracking ship Huntsville.

238:32:20 Evans: Roger. You have sunrise at 25. Burn time is at 31.
238:32:32 McDivitt: Okay.
238:32:35 Evans: And, 9, Houston. We moved over there a bit in our orbit; we'll use antenna Bravo for the deorbit burn.
238:32:44 McDivitt: Okay. Antenna Bravo for deorbit burn.
238:32:48 Evans: And we'll still stay on Charlie for entry.
238:32:53 McDivitt: Okay.
This is Apollo Control, still standing by over Honeysuckle, overlapping coverage to tracking ship Huntsville till 48 past the hour, approximately 14 minutes remaining.
Long comm break.
238:38:06 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, I'll put it away. [Garble].
238:38:38 Schweickart (onboard): Oh, where's the tape?
238:38:41 McDivitt (onboard): Probably hanging up there on the...
238:38:43 Scott (onboard): No, I put it away, Rusty. Do you want some? I've got a few feet left.
238:38:46 Schweickart (onboard): Yes. I want to - I'd like - Is it too far away?
238:38:49 Scott (onboard): No, you know, it's really...
238:38:51 Schweickart (onboard): I'd like to tape up my pocket.
238:38:55 Scott (onboard): Oh, that stuff is the stuff you don't want to get...
238:38:57 Schweickart (onboard): Yes. Well, no, I don't care if it gets - This is non- wet stuff, that's okay. This is the wet stuff but it's stuff I don't want to fall out. So I'm going to...
238:39:04 Scott (onboard): Sounds like a good idea, anyway. Tape it. Okay. (Humming) [Garble]. Go someplace [garble].
238:39:13 Schweickart (onboard): Well, I've got to go down there anyway to stow the PIC's and all.
238:39:18 Schweickart (onboard): Up at the top? In the front?
238:39:56 Scott (onboard): Those are [garble] I've seen before. I guess [garble].
238:39:57 Schweickart (onboard): I've never seen that [garble].
This is Apollo Control, some 6 minutes remaining in the AOS over the tracking ship Huntsville. We'll leave the circuit open to monitor the remainder of this pass. Between Huntsville Loss of Signal and Hawaii acquisition is about an even minute. Apollo 9 is a little past half way through the 150th revolution. Air-to-ground still open to monitor the remainder of this pass over the Huntsville.
238:40:22 Schweickart (onboard): Boy. This thing sure wants to go out of plane, doesn't it?
238:40:24 McDivitt (onboard): Yes. It always wants to go someplace where you don't want it to go.
238:40:57 Scott (onboard): Okay. That's all done.
This is Apollo Control. We have had Loss of Signal over the tracking ship Huntsville, and we're coming up on Hawaii within a few seconds. Meanwhile, the weather situation in the prime recovery area zone where the land platform helicopter USS Guadalcanal is on station. They are reporting a ceiling of 2,000 feet scattered clouds and another layer at 1,200 feet, scatter broken, visibility 10 miles, wind light and variable, waves 1 to 2 feet, swells 6 to 8 feet, air temperature 73 degrees [F, 23°C], water temperature 75 degrees [F, 24°C]. We should be acquiring at Hawaii momentarily. During this Apollo 9 reentry, it is anticipated that the highest temperature on the heat shield surface will be around 2,700 degrees F [1,480°C]. The highest heat shield temperature of a manned flight has been on Apollo 8 after lunar return at some 5,000 degrees F [2,760°C]. And the highest ever endured by an Apollo spacecraft heat shield was on Apollo 4, an unmanned flight, and the first use of the Saturn V launch vehicle where the temperature reached some 5,100 degrees F [2,815°C]. We have had acquisition at Hawaii and we will monitor the air-to-ground circuit for any conversation that takes place over that station. Hawaii, incidentally, overlaps tracking ship Redstone and all through the stateside stations for a very long pass ending at Canary Loss of Signal - as you were, we missed Canaries this time - Vanguard Loss of Signal at 22 minutes past the hour. Monitoring air-to-ground over Hawaii.
238:41:01 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble] transponder out [garble].
238:41:05 Scott (onboard): What I like about this program, it sure makes a difference [garble] for launch degrees [garble].
238:41:16 McDivitt (onboard): Are you cold?
238:41:17 Scott (onboard): I was just standing down there with this thing blowing on me. Pretty cool.
238:41:45 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble] above your head, Jim. I'll get it.
This is Apollo Control. This stateside pass is starting out much like the last one, very quiet, very little conversation. The crew is probably quite busy at this time getting ready for the entry image [?], which comes at some 1 hour and 35 minutes from now when ignition time for SPS burn number 8. Splash time, 2 hours and 4 minutes away. We will leave the circuit open on the air-to-ground for any possible conversation across the states here.
238:42:03 McDivitt (onboard): Hey, here's by [garble].
238:42:04 Scott (onboard): Good.
238:42:15 McDivitt (onboard): Yes. [Garble]. Boing! Boing!
238:42:18 McDivitt (onboard): Oh, that's good news.
238:42:21 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, great.
238:42:22 Scott (onboard): Oh, oh. Say, that's just terrific.
238:42:31 Schweickart (onboard): Yes sir, man. Those things just look real good. If they'd stay on, they might be dead weight.
238:42:40 Schweickart (onboard): (Laughter)
238:42:41 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble] landing [garble]. How come [garble] landing [garble].
238:42:54 Scott (onboard): Have we got any film left in the tunnel?
238:42:58 Schweickart (onboard): Oh, yes. Checklist is up there.
238:43:02 Scott (onboard): Did we separate those checklists, Jim?
238:43:03 Schweickart (onboard): Yes - no. Not the entry checklist.
238:43:17 McDivitt (onboard): (Yawn) You haven't received the update for it, right?
238:43:19 Schweickart (onboard): Yes.
238:43:20 McDivitt (onboard): Okay. I think I will take one of those pieces of tape. Where is the tape, Dave?
238:43:28 Scott (onboard): [Garble] three [garble].
238:44:18 Scott (onboard): Here's the tape. I'll put it back in [garble].
238:44:25 McDivitt (onboard): Well, I guess I'll get in my suit. Dress up. Buckle down. (Singing)
238:44:44 Schweickart (onboard): I've got to stow the PFC's and all that Junk.
238:44:46 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble]. (Singing) [Garble].
238:45:13 Scott (onboard): Okay. [Garble] alright.
238:45:25 Scott (onboard): Yes. [Garble].
238:45:37 Schweickart (onboard): Okay. (Laughter) I think they just contribute to breaking your ankle right off.
238:46:12 McDivitt (onboard): Oh, shoot. I've got [garble] ORDEAL.
238:46:17 Schweickart (onboard): Yes. That's in the checklist, Jim. We haven't quite got there yet.
238:46:46 Scott (onboard): [Garble]. do that.
238:46:59 McDivitt (onboard): Do you think [garble].
238:47:10 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble] that bag [garble].
238:47:20 Scott (onboard): Will you deposit that someplace down there for me?
238:47:24 Scott (onboard): Thank you.
238:47:35 Schweickart (onboard): Okay.
238:48:34 Scott (onboard): Can you tell which is the right bag and which is the left bag? They're all the same to me.
238:48:49 McDivitt (onboard): I'm going to add a little attitude simulation [garble].
238:48:53 Schweickart (onboard): Attitude simulation?
238:48:54 Scott (onboard): Simulation for the real time?
238:49:02 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, what do you mean by an attitude simulation?
238:49:09 McDivitt (onboard): If I did, I could see the [garble] from up through the window.
238:49:11 Scott (onboard): Oh, that's a good idea!
238:49:17 McDivitt (onboard): We're supposed to Retro at 240:31:14; the time on the Retro is - third Retro at 9:01.
Long comm break.
REDSTONE [REV 150 ]

238:56:49 McDivitt: Roger. Houston, Apollo 9.
238:56:51 Evans: Roger. We've been integrating your state vector and we'd like to update you another one. We'll do it in about 2 minutes at Redstone.
238:57:01 McDivitt: Okay.
238:57:05 McDivitt: Okay. You've got P00 and Accept.
238:57:06 Evans: Roger. Will do it probably at 58.
238:57:12 McDivitt: Okay.
Comm break.
GOLDSTONE [REV 150]
238:59:48 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
238:59:50 Scott: Go ahead. Houston, Apollo 9.
238:59:52 Evans: Roger. We had real weak signal strengths there at Redstone. We'll catch it up at Goldstone.
239:00:01 Scott: Okay. Very good. Get it at Goldstone.
239:00:22 Evans: 9, Houston. Request Accept.
239:00:26 Scott: Roger. You've got it.
239:01:14 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
239:01:16 Scott: Go ahead. Houston, Apollo 9.
239:01:17 Evans: Roger. We'd like for you to whip through P30 and P40 again and reload those two programs. After you...
239:01:26 Scott: We've got a 2101 on the DSKY now flashing. Can you get in, or are you through, or what?
239:01:31 Evans: Negative. We are not through yet. Soon as the computer is yours, you can go into that. And I have a Nav check here if you want it.
239:01:40 Scott: All right. Stand by.
239:01:51 Scott: Okay. Go ahead with the Nav check.
239:01:53 Evans: Roger. 240:00:00.00, minus 3112, plus 10039 2298. Over.
239:02:18 Scott: Roger. 240:00:00.00, minus 3112, plus 10039 2298, and just what exactly are you uplinking on this mode?
239:02:31 Evans: We are just uplinking a state vector.
239:02:34 Scott: Okay. State vector uplink. I understand.
239:02:37 Scott: Okay. That means we are going to have to reload P30.
239:02:40 Evans: Affirmative.
239:03:33 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. The computer is yours.
239:03:38 McDivitt: Thank you.
239:03:39 Scott: Okay. We have got it, and we will go through P30 now for you.
239:03:42 Evans: Roger. And we just wanted to give you a little better hit record than you had in playing baseball a while back.
239:03:50 McDivitt: Oh, hey. We were real sorry in that ball game. We should really be great today.
239:03:55 Evans: That's right.
239:04:54 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
239:04:58 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
239:05:00 Scott: Okay. That gives us a 10th of a foot per second difference Delta-VR, but I guess we can take that, huh?
239:05:07 Evans: 9, Houston. Say again. I missed it.
239:05:10 Scott: I say that gives us about a 10th of a foot per second difference in Delta-VR, but I guess we can take that.
239:05:15 Evans: Roger.
This is Apollo Control. Apollo 9 presently is over north Texas about the Dallas-Fort Worth area and again on this stateside pass there is a very little amount of conversation going on, but the circuit will be left open for the remainder of this pass which ends over the Vanguard at 22 minutes past the hour - some 11 minutes from now. Apollo Control monitoring air-ground on Apollo 9.
Apollo Control here. Apollo 9 is just starting revolution 151 - the last full revolution of this mission. Aboard the spacecraft the cabin pressure is now 4.9 pounds per square inch. Cabin temperature is 70 degrees Fahrenheit [21°C]. We'll continue to monitor air-ground for the duration of this pass.
This is Apollo Control. Some 6 minutes remaining until Loss of Signal through the tracking ship Vanguard. Conversation is being kept to a minimum between the ground here at Mission Control and the crew of Apollo 9, as the crew is busy getting the spacecraft ready for entry - which now is some one hour and 14 minutes away.
Console tops and lapels are sporting many flags - small American flags passed out earlier in the morning by Spacecraft Communicator Ron Evans. We'll continue to monitor the air-ground circuit until Loss of Signal at Vanguard.
This is Apollo Control. Two minutes from Loss of Signal at tracking ship Vanguard, in mid Atlantic. Standing by for the remainder of this pass.
This is Apollo Control and we are right on the verge of Loss of Signal at the tracking ship Vanguard. Ascension Island tracking station coming up at 29 past the hour, approximately 7 minutes from now. And at 239 hours, 22 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
Very long comm break.

239:28:01 McDivitt (onboard): Okay. [Garble].
239:28:03 Schweickart (onboard): Alright.
239:28:13 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble] blowing on that [garble] stick through the handhold there, probably [garble].
239:28:28 Scott (onboard): Okay, I got the Pyro Batteries [garble] Communicators' Buses A and B; got that. Okay. If Pyro Bat [garble] CB Main A, Bat C, Close; CB Main B, Bat C, Close. Okay. We leave Bat C on the line. That's unusual. Where's your update, Rusty? Says Bat C is on the line. Where is the update? Have you got it somewhere?
This is Apollo Control; 239 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, coming into acquisition at the tracking station Ascension Island in the South Atlantic. We will stand by for any conversation as it takes place over this station. Meanwhile at the recovery zone, 152-1, in the west Atlantic, Rescue 2 Aircraft is off the ground en route and an aircraft out of McCoy Air Force Base near Orlando, a radar aircraft, a Constellation, piloted by Col. Richard A. Naldreth of Parkersville, Pennsylvania is on route to a point south of the recovery station of the Guadalcanal, it will in turn sweep the incoming track of Apollo 9 with its radars to get a leg up on the fix, or the landing point, and the trajectory of the spacecraft.
239:29:41 Schweickart (onboard): Okay. Bat C, both main buses. Okay. All panel 8 circuit breakers closed except - Ready?
239:29:51 McDivitt (onboard): Go.
239:29:52 Schweickart (onboard): Post Landing Vent, one, and Float Bags, three, to Open.
239:29:58 McDivitt (onboard): Okay. Go on.
239:30:02 Schweickart (onboard): Command Module Heaters, two, Open.
239:30:09 McDivitt (onboard): Command Module Heater, EDS, three, Open.
ASCENSION [REV 151 ]
239:30:13 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Ascension.
239:30:17 McDivitt: Go. Houston, Apollo 9.
239:30:17 Schweickart (onboard): EDS, three, [garble].
239:30:22 Evans: Roger, Jim. Your altimeter Delta H is minus 100 feet, and your seawater temperature is 75 degrees. The air temperature is about 75 degrees. Mighty fine.
239:30:36 McDivitt (onboard): Great.
239:30:37 Schweickart (onboard): How about that?
239:30:38 McDivitt: Great. We put on two sets of long underwear too, just expecting it would be cold.
239:30:43 Schweickart (onboard): I'm going to open up these EDS circuit breakers [garble]
239:30:48 Evans: I missed it there.
239:30:52 McDivitt: I said, we even put two sets of long underwear on just so we'd be warm in the water.
239:30:56 Evans: Roger. I don't think it'll be necessary.
239:31:01 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, Rusty, what else you got?
239:31:02 Schweickart (onboard): CB Docking Probe, two, Open.
239:31:05 McDivitt (onboard): Docking Probe, Open.
239:31:08 Schweickart (onboard): Nine - 11 breakers you should have open...
239:31:10 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
239:31:11 Schweickart (onboard): Plus two more - which - makes 13 now.
239:31:14 McDivitt (onboard): Check just to make sure [garble] I got EDS, three; Post Landing, four; FLOAT BAGS, [garble].
This is Apollo Control; the recovery helicopters aboard the Guadalcanal are now estimated to take off from the deck at 10:51 Central Standard Time; be on station for Apollo 9 splashdown. Rescue 2 is in the air, on route to its station, out of Kinnley Air Force Base in Bermuda. It's piloted by Captain Thomas L. Stinstrum of Bloomfield, Conn.
239:32:36 McDivitt: Hello, Houston. Apollo 9.
239:32:38 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
239:32:41 McDivitt: Roger. We are ready to add up our logic here. Are you willing to support?
239:32:48 Evans: Roger. Stand by
239:32:56 Evans: Roger. You can go ahead and turn your logic switches on. We've got about 2 minutes.
239:33:00 McDivitt (onboard): Okay. ELS Logic going to Off - Off.
239:33:02 McDivitt: Okay. ELS logic going Auto coming on; ELS to Auto - Seq ECS Logic coming On.
239:33:03 Schweickart (onboard): ELS to Auto...
239:33:28 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. You are Go for Pyro Arm.
239:33:32 McDivitt: Roger. Go for Pyro Arm.
239:33:46 Evans: One minute to LOS. Tananarive at 43, and if not there, Carnarvon at 58.
239:33:53 McDivitt: Roger.
239:34:09 McDivitt: Houston, if we fire the RCS - command RCS pressurization On, can you still support?
239:34:16 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Negative. We'll catch you at Carnarvon.
239:34:22 Scott: Okay.
239:34:22 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
239:34:23 Schweickart (onboard): Pyro Arm, On.
239:34:25 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
239:34:51 McDivitt (onboard): You doing alright?
239:35:00 Schweickart (onboard): Eating all that fruitcake - before the big one. [Garble] fruitcake, do you?
This is Apollo Control. Coming up on LOS at the Ascension Island Tracking Station - all of the surface vessels in the recovery force are on station at this time. Other aircraft in the air en route to the recovery area. The ARIA 1 - or as you were, ARIA 4, and ARIA 6 aircraft; these are Apollo Range Instrumented Aircraft based at Patrick Air Force Base. ARIA 4 piloted by Major Frank E. Cane, Jr., and ARIA 6 by Captain T. L. Cherryholmes. Later on, as the spacecraft comes into the atmosphere and is on the last leg of the entry profile, an aircraft, KC 135 aircraft, not an ARIA, called an ALOTS, with the code name "Glow worm 123" - the ALOTS is an acronym for Airborne Lightweight Optical Tracking System; it's a camera pod on the outside of the aircraft, it'll fly on head on toward the spacecraft trajectory and when they lock on they will do a hard right turn, and attempt to track the spacecraft with the camera until, of course, they lose sight of it. This was done during Apollo 8, as an experiment, and, it was a night entry, and entry in darkness, and was readily spotted. They are not too sure they will be able to spot Apollo 9 in daylight however. Next station Apollo 9 will cross over will be the Tananarive station on the Island of Madagascar, Malagasy Republic, 43 minutes past the hour. And at 239 hours, 36 minutes...
239:35:06 Scott (onboard): No.
239:35:08 McDivitt (onboard): You don't think it's a 350-pound fruitcake?
239:35:10 Scott (onboard): No.
239:35:24 McDivitt (onboard): Okay - We're on [garble].
239:36:15 Schweickart (onboard): I finally figured it out (laughter), but it sure isn't the way we been doing it.
239:36:31 McDivitt (onboard): Oh, no! We used them all night again. We used the 90-degree roll and leave this one at zero. This one always stays where it is - at 55 degrees. Come down [garble] just like the others [garble].
239:36:43 Schweickart (onboard): Well, that's what I thought, too. I just looked at the numbers, and I don't think they'd [garble] at all. But it might [garble].
239:36:52 Schweickart (onboard): It might take their numbers and put them on a 55-degree roll and right there [garble].
239:37:29 Scott (onboard): Do we want to turn the logic into [garble]?
239:37:33 Schweickart (onboard): No. [Garble].
Comm break.
239:39:42 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble] 55, 55, Jim?
239:39:44 McDivitt (onboard): 50, 60. 50; 60; you said we were starting to roll [garble].
239:40:00 Scott (onboard): Oh, I don't have that stuff there. I just got my [garble], if I don't get there!
239:40:07 Scott (onboard): Yes! [Garble].
239:40:25 Schweickart (onboard): There goes the EMS; that probably won't work.
Comm break.
239:41:34 McDivitt (onboard): Let's hold those things up at the light.
Comm break.
239:42:41 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble] we checked it out.
This is Apollo Control; 239 hours, 43 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 9 is coming up on the tracking station at Tananarive, about an 8-minute pass. At this time, the crew, according to the Flight Plan, is maneuvering to the deorbit attitude, which is rolled over, heads down - as you were - heads up, blunt end forward and our engine nozzle toward the direction of flight, and pitched down 31.7 degrees below the horizon. On station at the prime recovery zone is the tracking - as you were - the prime recovery ship Guadalcanal, at this point is at 650 nautical [miles, 1,200 km] south southwest of Bermuda, 830 nautical miles [1,540 km] east southeast of Cape Kennedy, 311 nautical miles [576 km] northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico. This point is some 464 nautical miles [859 km] south of what was to have been the prime recovery zone prior to the extension by one revolution of this mission, because of weather. The aircraft mentioned earlier that are en route to the recovery zone, Rescue 1, will be on station 150 nautical miles [280 km] uprange of the prime recovery ship and approximately 100 nautical miles [185 km] north of the ground track. Rescue 2 - both of these incidentally, are HC130 Herky birds - Rescue 2 will be 150 nautical miles [280 km] downrange of the ship and 100 nautical miles [185 km] north of the ground track. Airboss, flying a helicopter, will be generally orbiting the prime recovery ship and directing operations out there. The radar Constellation, out of McCoy Air Force Base, will be located 50 to 60 miles [90-110 km] north of the ground track and abeam of the target point. Standing by here over Tananarive for any possible conversation at this time. However, since the crew is maneuvering to reentry and deorbit attitude, it is unlikely there will be a great deal of conversation. Countdown clock shows 44 minutes, 53 seconds remaining until ignition; and 1 hour, 14 minutes until splashdown. We will leave the circuit open here to monitor any possible conversation through Tananarive.
239:43:57 Schweickart (onboard): Hmmm boy, good to the last [garble] grape.
This is Apollo Control, about 3 minutes remaining in the Tananarive pass. Carnarvon at 58 minutes past the hour, some 10 minutes from now. During the Carnarvon pass, Mission Control Center will pass up to the crew a Go-No/Go for the deorbit burn, which takes place over Hawaii. We are standing by over Tananarive.
239:44:26 McDivitt (onboard): Tell you what [garble] call up a Verb 49.
239:44:57 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, I'm going to go CMC, Auto, here.
This is Apollo Control. We have had Loss of Signal at the Tananarive station and Carnarvon coming up at 58 minutes past the hour, about 7 minutes from now. At 239 hours, 51 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
239:45:03 Scott (onboard): Okay. Got with DAP and we'll go to...
239:45:35 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble] 5 feet getting [garble].
239:45:50 McDivitt (onboard): Running like mad out there.
239:45:55 Scott (onboard): Oh, yes?
239:45:57 Schweickart (onboard): The water boiling.
239:45:58 Scott (onboard): What? Oh, yes, the water boiling.
239:46:02 Schweickart (onboard): Secondary. Scattered Somewhat.
239:46:15 Schweickart (onboard): You cold?
239:46:53 McDivitt (onboard): When we reconfigure for entry, I'll get a [garble].
239:47:26 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble] check it for [garble]. We get the - [garble] off [garble] Y-Y and you've got the [garble] check out. [Garble] X-thrusters
239:47:49 Schweickart (onboard): You got the S-Band, On, Dave?
239:47:53 Scott (onboard): No, we got lock?
239:47:54 Schweickart (onboard): No.
239:47:55 McDivitt (onboard): Hey, where's your [garble]?
239:48:00 Schweickart (onboard): I just wondered if you had your S-Band Volume, Off, because if you do, they're going to miss us.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control et 239 hours, 58 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Coming up on the Carnarvon, Australian tracking station at which station the crew of Apollo 9 will be given a Go-No/Go for deorbit burn. And we're standing by for...
CARNARVON [REV 151 ]
239:58:24 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Carnarvon.
239:58:27 McDivitt: Roger, Houston. Apollo 9 here. Are you ready to support the arming and firing of the Command Module RCS pressurization?
239:58:35 Evans: Roger. We have a good lock on now. You can go ahead.
239:58:47 McDivitt: Roger. ELS is coming to Auto now. ELS Logic On now. Seq ECS Logic to On now. Do we have a go for arming the Pyros now, Houston?
239:59:09 Evans: Affirmative. Go for arming the Pyros.
239:59:40 McDivitt: Houston, CM RCS Press. Mark.
239:59:48 McDivitt: Looks like we got both of them, Houston.
239:59:53 Evans: Roger. They're looking good here.
240:00:08 McDivitt: Pyros coming Off, Houston.
240:00:10 Evans: Roger.
Apollo Control here. The recovery ship Guadalcanal reports Miltown [?] conditions at the prime recovery zone. Guadalcanal will be orbiting the target point so that the distance that Apollo 9 comes down from the ship is really rather meaningless in terms of accuracy. The distance from the target point will be the meaningful number. In other words, how well was the aim. We'll continue to monitor the Carnarvon pass here and cut in on any air/ground. And some earlier flights...
240:01:54 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9.
240:01:56 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
240:01:59 McDivitt: Are we going to retrofire over Hawaii?
240:02:02 Evans: Affirmative.
240:02:07 McDivitt: OK; so we can expect a voice countdown?
240:02:09 Evans: Affirmative.
240:02:10 McDivitt: Very good.
240:02:15 McDivitt: Mark.
240:02:16 Evans: We are right with you.
240:02:19 McDivitt: Okay. Next time it's your turn.
240:02:21 Evans: Roger.
240:02:43 McDivitt: I have 29 minutes on my mark.
240:03:33 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. We've dumped the tape recorder, rewound it, and it's yours now.
240:03:40 McDivitt: Roger.
240:04:03 Evans: And 9, Houston. We'll have you through the Huntsville until 23. Pick you up at Hawaii at 25.
240:04:10 McDivitt: Very good.
240:04:18 McDivitt: Right now we are just sort of holding, getting ready to enter P40. We'll enter there about T minus 12 or so.
240:04:25 Evans: Roger.
Comm break.
240:06:27 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Looking good down here. You are Go for deorbit.
240:06:34 McDivitt: Roger. Houston, Apollo 9. We look pretty good from up here, too. And we're ready.
Comm break.
240:08:21 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. About 1 minute LOS; the Huntsville at 14.
240:08:27 Scott: Roger. We'll see you at the Huntsville.
240:08:29 Evans: Roger.
This is Apollo Control. We have had Loss of Signal at the Carnarvon, Australia tracking station. We will pick up again at the Huntsville at 14 minutes past the hour, some 4 minutes away. Meanwhile, word has come in that air rescue aircraft has been scrambled out of Kinley Air Force Base to go to the assistance of a Canadian ship, the Ghislain, which is without power and is in danger of sinking. The ship is located at 37 degrees North, 60 degrees West, which is just east of the Island of Bermuda. Getting back to the subject of the ship position relative to the target point or splashdown, some of the Gemini flights were pretty close to the target point. For example, Gemini 9 was .38 [nautical] miles [0.7 km] off the target point. This mission was flown by Tom Stafford and Eugene Cernan. Next closest was Gemini 12, 2.6 nautical miles [4.8 km] off the target point. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin flew that mission. Next was Gemini 11, 2.65 [4.9 km], almost the same distance off the target point. That was Gordon and Conrad, Dick Gordon and Pete Conrad. Gemini 10, 3.4 nautical miles [6.3 km] off the target point, Mike Collins and John Young. Mercury flights MA8 and MA9, Walter Schirra and Gordon Cooper, respectively, were both some 4 or 5 [nautical] miles [7 or 9 km] off from the ship. These, however, were pure ballistic entries with no lift such as the Gemini and Apollo spacecraft have. During the entry the crew will be using a display device called an Entry Monitor System which gives the crew six visual cues to monitor the output of the Primary Guidance and Navigation Control System. Among these are the .05 G light, which denotes the start of deceleration, the first sensible deceleration 5/100ths of a G, the roll stability indicator, which shows the direction in which the spacecraft lift if applied, the spacecraft has a lift much like a pie plate thrown by a child in that it sort of skips in the atmosphere to some degree from having an offset center of gravity, and by controlling this lift and rotating the spacecraft and thereby the lift vector, the length of the entry can be controlled. Also in the Entry Monitor System is a display called the corridor verification indicator, which is not meaningful in Apollo 9, as used on lunar returns. We've had acquisition at the Huntsville. We'll continue to monitor here and cut in as the conversation commences. Also in the Entry Monitor System is a range of Delta-V display, which shows the range in nautical miles to the predicted splash point. Also, the Delta-V or thrust change velocity change during thrusting, the flight monitor plots G's and velocity, that is acceleration and speed on a visual graph against known values. The entry scroll shows the range to the impact point or splash point graphically in the form of a lift profile. The Entry Monitor System display is on the commander's panel, the left side of the spacecraft, just above his Flight Director/Attitude Indicator, which in an aircraft would be called an 8 ball. The helicopters are being deployed at this time from the Guadalcanal, getting on station for this recovery operation. We're 16 minutes now away from ignition for the SPS deorbit burn. After the deorbit burn, in which they will be pitched down 37.1 degrees, the spacecraft will yaw 45 degrees for the separation of the Service Module. Let's listen to the conversation.
Long comm break.
HUNTSVILLE [REV 151]
240:15:42 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
240:15:46 McDivitt: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 9.
240:15:47 Evans: Roger. Loud and clear, Jim. The helos are just now lifting off the flight deck of the carrier.
240:15:58 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9 here. I can't read you.
240:16:03 Evans: Roger. Nothing important. How now?
240:16:10 McDivitt: You are very weak, Houston.
This is Apollo Control standing over Huntsville. Some 5 minutes remaining over Huntsville, slight overlap of Guam, pretty much to the south of Guam. There will be about a minute break between LOS Huntsville and Hawaii acquisition. We are 12 minutes away from retrofire, continuing to monitor the air to ground circuit. As the retrofire burn is completed, and the Service Module is separated with a yaw of 45 degrees to get the Service Module out of the way to avoid any recontact and then the crew rolls over heads down with a pitch up of some 33 degrees, relative to the local horizontal for the entry profile. Monitoring air to around now over Huntsville,
This is Apollo Control. The radar aircraft out of McCoy Air Force Base is now on station to track Apollo 9 as it comes smoking back into the atmosphere. Some 2 minutes away from Loss of Signal at Huntsville. tracking ship Huntsville, and coming up on Hawaii, some 9 minutes away from that retrofire.
This is Apollo Control. Two of the Hercules HC130 aircraft, Rescue 1 and Rescue 2, on station in the prime recovery zone, reported radio contact, S-band radio contact, with Apollo 9, during the preceding revolution, revolution 151, which portends good communications, hopefully, during the entry phase, while on the chutes. Airboss, the man of station in charge of all the recovery operations, aircraft, involved in recovery aircraft preparations is in the air. It's piloted by lieutenant Commander James A. McGee, of Atlanta, Georgia. Copilot is Lieutenant Paul A. Nelson of Green Bay, Wisconsin. In the crew are antisubmarine warfare technicians, Kenneth H. Flenner of Rogersville, Tennessee and John M. Lovelady of Fort Worth, Texas. Six minutes away now from deorbit burn, 36 minutes away from splash. Should have Hawaii acquisition in - Mark, right now. Should have AOS.
Long comm break.
HAWAII [REV 151 ]
240:25:07 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Hawaii. Standing by.
240:25:09 Scott: Roger, Houston Apollo 9 here. We're going up on six minutes.
240:25:14 Evans: Roger.
240:25:15 Evans: Mark.
240:25:17 Evans: Six minutes.
That SPS burn number 8, the one to deorbit Apollo 9, will be a 325-foot per second [99 m/s] retrograde burn of 11.6 seconds duration. Mission Operations Control Room is getting a little quieter now as we come down to the wire here, less than 5 minutes now from ignition.
Apollo Range Instrument range Aircraft 4 and 6 are on station. It's reported that the gimbal motors for the large SPS engine have been turned on. This a ground readout. The aircraft which will attempt to photograph the Apollo 9 Command Module during the reentry pass by flying head on into the path uprange is on station. This aircraft is called Glowworm 123, it's a KC135 with a camera pod mounted on the side of the fuselage. Air to ground circuit is strangely quiet as the crew is setting into deorbit attitude, some 3 minutes, 12 seconds away from deorbit burn. We will leave the circuit open for any conversation.
Blackout is predicted to begin 15 minutes, 56 seconds after ignition. Come out of blackout at 19 minutes, 29 seconds with drogues out at 23 minutes, 46 seconds. Main chutes deploy at 24 minutes, 33 seconds after ignition of SPS burn number 8. Splashdown at 43 seconds past the hour.
All the recovery helicopters aboard the Guadalcanal have been deployed from the deck and are on station waiting for splashdown of Apollo 9.

240:39:39 Schweickart (onboard): Right. Where are the needles? Needles look good.
240:39:42 McDivitt (onboard): Okay. The horizon is going to come back up here in just a minute.
240:39:57 Schweickart (onboard): That's a fair bang.
240:40:00 McDivitt (onboard): Looked nice.
240:40:02 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, very nice. We need just a few more.
240:40:18 Scott (onboard): 6 minutes TFF.
240:40:20 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
240:40:22 Schweickart (onboard): How does that compare with the...
240:40:25 Scott (onboard): 20 seconds, 0.05g.
240:40:28 Schweickart (onboard): ...difference? Okay.
240:40:29 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, we're definitely blunt end forward, and we're definitely upside down; all I've got to do is get up to the horizon now and...
240:40:32 Schweickart (onboard): Hey, there's the Salton Sea.
240:40:34 Scott (onboard): How about that?
240:40:36 Schweickart (onboard): Again, huh?
240:40:37 Scott (onboard): Again.
240:40:39 Schweickart (onboard): Gee, I don't [garble] wait. Okay.
240:40:51 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, we're getting [garble]...
240:40:52 Schweickart (onboard): Start the EMS manually at RET of 0.05g, huh?
240:40:57 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, we haven't gotten any updates yet, have we?
240:41:00 Scott (onboard): No.
240:41:01 Schweickart (onboard): No, we got the DET reset to 3 minutes and counting up, right?
240:41:05 McDivitt (onboard): Right.
240:41:06 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, set your RET at 0.05g; Jim, got that?
240:41:10 McDivitt (onboard): RET at 0.05g is 15:27, right.
240:41:12 Schweickart (onboard): Right.
240:41:16 Schweickart (onboard): Wish I could see that stupid DET.
240:41:19 Scott (onboard): Yes, it's 10:05 right now.
240:41:21 Schweickart (onboard): EMS is still saying they're going to get there 20 seconds earlier.
240:41:42 McDivitt (onboard): There the horizon comes.
240:41:44 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, everybody got their heels in?
240:41:45 Scott (onboard): Yes.
240:41:47 Schweickart (onboard): Heels are in.
240:42:06 Scott (onboard): Okay, P6 [garble]...
240:42:07 McDivitt (onboard): Set the horizon up to the 32-degree line.
240:42:18 Schweickart (onboard): How's that water?
240:42:20 Scott (onboard): It's good; 50 percent.
240:42:22 Schweickart (onboard): Let me check how that water boiler is doing. The water boiler is doing alright.
240:42:31 McDivitt (onboard): There go the needles - that a boy - right where they are supposed to come.
240:42:35 Schweickart (onboard): Both water boilers are working good.
240:42:37 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, fine. Okay, the horizon is coming up just like it ought to come. I mean, the bar's coming up just like it ought to come.
240:42:52 McDivitt (onboard): We'll settle the dust here in a minute.
240:42:44 Schweickart (onboard): Say again.
240:42:55 McDivitt (onboard): I said we'll start settling the dust here in just a minute.
240:42:58 Schweickart (onboard): 3 minutes. 3 minutes. [Garble].
240:43:05 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, we're - That's off; we're on 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2; one is Up; one is Up; one is Up; one is Up; one is Up; one is Up. How is the Prop doing?
240:43:20 Scott (onboard): Propellant's good. I just checked them both.
240:43:22 Schweickart (onboard): That is well.
240:43:26 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble].
240:43:29 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. I have a postburn update.
240:43:32 McDivitt (onboard): Roger. Go ahead...
240:43:33 Scott: Roger. Go ahead.
240:43:37 Evans: Plus 12091: 25996: 15:25: 16:01: minus 03256: roll right, 50/60; 19:00; and I'll get the rest a little later.
That first number passed to the crew of Apollo 9 was the range to go from the point at .05 g of 1209 nautical miles [2,239 km], and the velocity at that point 25,996 feet per second [7,924 m/s]. 61 nautical mile [113 km] altitude. Should be encountering 400K, 400,000 feet [121.92 km], which is a sensible atmosphere at this time. Some 2 minutes away from beginning of blackout.
240:44:07 McDivitt (onboard): Roger. 15:25 is 0.05g - What's the RETRB?
240:44:08 Scott: Roger.
240:44:15 Schweickart (onboard): 19 minutes. Did you get the 1209.1 on the EMS now?
240:44:19 McDivitt (onboard): 1209.1.
240:44:20 Schweickart (onboard): Right. And V0 is still the same? Yes.
240:44:30 McDivitt (onboard): There you go.
240:44:31 Schweickart (onboard): V0 is still the same? Dave, did you get the new Delta-V?
240:44:35 Scott (onboard): Got it. Minus 3256.
240:44:37 Schweickart (onboard): Hight. Okay. What's the TFF now?
240:44:51 McDivitt (onboard): 15:35. Okay, we're going for 15:25.
240:44:53 Scott (onboard): 124 TFF. It's getting closer. Actually, it looks like it's trimming already.
240:45:03 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. I have time to begin blackout.
240:45:07 Schweickart: Go ahead.
240:45:08 Evans: 15:53, 19:28, 23:46, 24:33.
240:45:15 Scott (onboard): Those are good.
240:45:19 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, I'll read the whole thing back. 1209.1, 25996, 15:25, 16:01, minus 03256; right 50/60, 19:00, 15:53, 19:28, 23:46, 24:33.
240:45:39 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Your readback correct.
240:45:40 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, I'm going to start taking pictures; we're getting...
240:45:41 McDivitt (onboard): Yes, turn - turn the camera on.
240:45:42 Schweickart (onboard): ...red out there. Yes.
240:45:43 Scott (onboard): Yes. Take your pictures.
240:45:50 Scott (onboard): Okay. 0.01g.
That last group of numbers involved times for beginning and end of blackout, drogue deploy and main parachute deploy.
240:45:55 Schweickart (onboard): See, you can see the Moon through the red there.
240:46:05 Scott (onboard): 0.02g.
240:46:06 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
240:46:18 Schweickart (onboard): 0.03g.
240:46:19 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
240:46:22 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, and you are ready to start the EMS manually at 0.04g...
240:46:26 Scott (onboard): At 16 - No.
240:46:27 McDivitt (onboard): What?
240:46:28 Schweickart (onboard): At 15:25.
240:46:29 McDivitt (onboard): 15:25, right.
240:46:30 Schweickart (onboard): Right.
240:46:39 Scott (onboard): 0.05g at 23.
240:46:40 McDivitt (onboard): 15:25. Going to CMC.
240:46:49 Schweickart (onboard): Okay - 0.05g light On; Manual Attitude, three, to Rate Command; point 0 - You got that, Jim? Okay.
240:46:55 McDivitt (onboard): Say that again. Go ahead through them again.
240:46:57 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, CMC; 0.05g light On.
240:47:00 McDivitt (onboard): Right.
A rather noisy circuit at this time; still about 40 seconds away from the predicted time for beginning of blackout which is 15 minutes, 53 seconds after retrofire. End of blackout is predicted at 19 minutes, 28 seconds after retrofire. Drogue parachute deploy predicted at 23 minutes, 46 seconds, and main parachutes at 24 minutes, 33 seconds. On the water at 43 seconds after 11 am Central Time. Mark, beginning of blackout, as predicted. Standing by here for spacecraft Apollo 9 to come out of blackout. This is some 3 minutes from now. Hopefully, communications will be reestablished through the relay aircraft orbiting around the Guadalcanal. Those communications will be fed through this circuit as they become available. Right now it's a waiting game. Quite a few of the off-duty Flight Controllers have drifted into the Control Room here.
240:47:01 Schweickart (onboard): Manual Attitude, three, to Rate Command. 0.05g switch, On, Up.
240:47:07 McDivitt (onboard): 0.05g switch, On, Up.
240:47:08 Schweickart (onboard): EMS ROLL, On, Up.
240:47:10 McDivitt (onboard): EMS Roll is On, Up.
240:47:11 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, and it was - standby for 67. Wow, that's bright out there, isn't it?
240:47:20 McDivitt (onboard): Isn't it, though?
240:47:22 Scott (onboard): DSKY's Go, Jim.
240:47:23 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, Dave.
240:47:24 Scott (onboard): Beautiful.
240:47:26 McDivitt (onboard): What we got here? Our first command?
240:47:42 Scott (onboard): That's really something, isn't it?
240:47:44 Schweickart (onboard): Isn't that something? God damn, it's really bright.
240:47:48 Scott (onboard): Spectacular, huh. Ooh, man, those movies will be great!
240:47:52 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, you guys, we're up to about 0.2g.
240:47:55 Schweickart (onboard): 0.2! God, it feels like 5; how do people live here?
240:48:00 Scott (onboard): Coming down here to your first bank command, sir.
Quite a few of the off duty flight controllers have drifted into the control room here and have plugged in, standing where they can find room to monitor the entry of Apollo 9. Most of them have put in 10 long, hard days on their respective shifts and want to see this thing through. Less than 2 minutes now to end of blackout. Present altitude according to Texas tracking, 34 nautical miles [63 km], present position 26.49 north, 76.29 west. Less than a minute now from coming out of blackout - present height 30 nautical miles [56 km] crossing the east coast of Florida. Coming up on end black out at predicted time. Mark; predicted end time of black out.
240:48:01 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, EMS isn't working. [Garble] lights up 1.
240:48:14 Scott (onboard): Okay, up to about 0.8.
240:48:16 Schweickart (onboard): Hard to believe.
240:48:32 Scott (onboard): Okay, bank now.
240:48:33 McDivitt (onboard): Alright, there it goes, almost 30 degrees.
240:48:37 Scott (onboard): That looks good. G&N's Go.
240:48:40 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, going around to 60 degrees.
240:48:45 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble]. That's pretty smooth, isn't it?
240:48:50 Scott (onboard): Okay, we're up to 1.0g.
240:48:51 Schweickart (onboard): God.
240:48:56 Scott (onboard): Okay, EMS looks good; they agree.
240:48:58 McDivitt (onboard): Very fine. Okay, we're over to a 90-degree bank.
240:49:10 Scott (onboard): 1.3g's on the DSKY.
240:49:12 McDivitt (onboard): Okay. EMS isn't working at all.
240:49:14 Scott (onboard): EMS looks good.
240:49:22 McDivitt (onboard): Hope that camera is running.
240:49:23 Schweickart (onboard): It is.
240:49:25 Scott (onboard): Your bank commander is up on the top.
240:49:27 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, fine; she's hanging right on it. We're up to about 1.5g's. Feels like the world's on you, doesn't it?
240:49:36 Schweickart (onboard): Boy, oh boy.
240:49:37 Scott (onboard): Okay, it's steering good.
240:49:39 Schweickart (onboard): Batteries are doing okay.
240:49:40 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, fine; it's doing real nice here. Nice and smooth without the RCS.
240:49:58 Scott (onboard): [Garble] is good.
240:49:59 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble]. Yes. That a boy. Okay, she's holding on 45, right in there.
240:50:10 Scott (onboard): That's 2g's.
240:50:22 McDivitt (onboard): EMS still isn't working.
240:50:24 Scott (onboard): Cabin pressure looks good.
240:50:26 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, fine.
240:50:28 Scott (onboard): Okay, EMS agrees.
240:50:29 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, fine.
240:50:31 Schweickart (onboard): And all the systems look good.
240:50:34 McDivitt (onboard): Should have a potential of about 400, I say here; yes, we're looking good.
240:50:39 Scott (onboard): Both rings are good.
240:50:40 McDivitt (onboard): Okay. About 2.2g's now. The rates are going along real nice, about plus or minus 1 degree per second, at 2.2.
TEXAS [REV 151 ]
240:50:46 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
Retrofire officer John Lewellyn is estimating they are going to be right on the target point.
240:51:03 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, still got 16,000 feet per second [4,900 m/s] - What's the RET, Jim?
240:51:08 McDivitt (onboard): 19:53.
240:51:10 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, we should be out of blackout here. Try the Omni switch here.
240:51:14 McDivitt (onboard): About 2.5 now.
240:51:15 Scott (onboard): Okay.
240:51:16 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
240:51:19 McDivitt (onboard): Crossrange 1.9, and the downrange 7.7; that looks pretty good.
240:51:23 Scott (onboard): Man, you can't beat that, can you? We might see that cake yet, tonight.
It is reported that the radar aircraft out of McCoy does have radar contact at this time.
240:51:33 Schweickart (onboard): How many g's have you got?
240:51:35 McDivitt (onboard): We've got about 2.75.
240:51:36 Schweickart (onboard): God, feels like 10.
240:51:44 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
240:51:55 McDivitt (onboard): It really drops it in there, doesn't it? 3.2g's now.
Present height, 23.7 nautical miles [43.9 km]. Coordinates 23.58 north, 68...
240:52:01 Evans: ARIA, Houston CapCom. Go remote.
240:52:02 Schweickart (onboard): Dave, let me know when...
240:52:03 Scott (onboard): Yes, I sure will, Rusty. Take care of it right now. Got a ways to go.
Remoting through the ARIA aircraft.
240:52:08 Schweickart (onboard): Okay. Oh, we got S-band back.
Some two minutes away from drogue deployment. Drogue chute deployment. 19 nautical miles [35 km] altitude. It is reported that the Guadalcanal crew did hear a sonic boom as the Apollo 9 spacecraft came into the atmosphere. Contact by the McCoy radar aircraft was 236 nautical miles [437 km] range. 7 minutes away from splash mark.
240:52:14 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through ARIA.
240:52:15 McDivitt (onboard): Roger, Houston. This is Apollo 9. We're having a very nice ride down. Okay, everything is going along real nice. 77 and it's steering right in there. Okay, looks like we're coming off the peak g. It looks like it's about 3.2, which is sort of like an old lady's ride. Which is about what I am right now (laughter).
240:52:26 Evans: Roger, Apollo 9. We can just barely read you.
240:52:41 Schweickart (onboard): Yes.
240:52:43 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, we got 65 miles to go on the EMS, so we should be getting there.
240:52:47 Scott (onboard): Yes.
240:52:50 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, I guess I'd better steer the other way. There we go, up 1. That's it. Stop there, right about there [garble]. Okay.
240:53:01 Scott (onboard): Almost forgot to [garble].
240:53:02 McDivitt (onboard): Just a little bit. [Garble] about 2 seconds per degree
240:53:09 Scott (onboard): Start looking, Rusty.
240:53:11 Schweickart (onboard): Okay. Oh, that sun.
240:53:20 McDivitt (onboard): Yes. In about a minute and...
240:53:23 Scott (onboard): Okay, right now, Rusty.
240:53:24 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, haven't moved yet.
240:53:36 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, it's going now.
240:53:40 McDivitt (onboard): The g's are really coming down now...
240:53:41 Schweickart (onboard): That's by my watch.
240:53:42 McDivitt (onboard): ...down to 2g's. They really came off then.
240:53:49 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble] RCS.
240:53:52 Scott (onboard): We should have the drogues in about a minute.
240:53:54 Schweickart (onboard): Roger.
240:53:57 McDivitt (onboard): Hello , Houston. Everything is looking good up here
240:54:02 Scott (onboard): Okay, Houston; Apollo 9 Plus 23.26, minus 68.01.
240:54:11 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, 30 seconds, Jim; the altimeter ought to come off the peg.
240:54:15 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, Rusty.
240:54:16 Schweickart (onboard): Now, we got that little thing hanging down, too, damn it.
240:54:22 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, here comes the altimeter; we're going to Boost/Entry.
240:54:24 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, the altimeter came up.
240:54:26 McDivitt (onboard): 50.
240:54:27 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, you got Boost and Entry.
240:54:28 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through ARIA.
240:54:30 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, the Pyro is Armed. All the circuit breakers are in.
240:54:32 Schweickart (onboard): Okay. Okay.
240:54:34 McDivitt (onboard): We go to ELS Logic and Auto at - at...
240:54:35 Schweickart (onboard): Okay.
240:54:36 Scott (onboard): Houston, Apollo 9. Do you read?
240:54:37 McDivitt: Apollo 9, ready to read.
240:54:37 Schweickart (onboard): You're 40K.
240:54:38 McDivitt (onboard): That's 40K.
240:54:39 Evans: Roger. Apollo 9, Houston. Go.
240:54:40 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, SECS Logic, On; Pyro Arm; ELS Logic in Auto...
240:54:42 Schweickart (onboard): EMS to Off and Standby
240:54:43 McDivitt: Okay. PUGS, 123.26, minus 68.01; and it looks like we are about a mile off...
240:54:43 McDivitt (onboard): I'll get that in a minute.
240:54:44 Schweickart (onboard): Okay.
240:54:45 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, Auto; EMS to Standby.
240:54:47 Schweickart (onboard): And Off. Off and Standby, Jim.
240:54:50 Evans: Roger. Real good. You ought to have chutes in about 10 seconds.
240:54:54 McDivitt: Okay.
240:55:00 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, Off [garble]. Okay, stand by, we're coming up on 20...
Very good communications through ARIA; should have confirmation of chute deployment shortly, Drogue chute deployment that is. Present altitude showing, well, it just disappeared off the display - delay that. Main chute should be going out at this time; Guadalcanal reports a contact at 308 degrees bearing from the ship. Crew at the Guadalcanal apparently has heard a double sonic boom as Apollo 9 smoked back into the atmosphere.
240:55:07 Schweickart (onboard): There it goes.
240:55:08 Scott (onboard): Good drogue.
240:55:09 Schweickart (onboard): Hey, good drogue.
240:55:12 McDivitt (onboard): Okay. RCS Command, Off.
240:55:14 Schweickart (onboard): RCS Command, Off. Apex Jett Cover, push.
240:55:17 McDivitt (onboard): Closed.
240:55:18 Schweickart (onboard): Okay. Cabin pressure increasing, and it is.
240:55:24 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
240:55:25 Schweickart (onboard): And standing by for 10K.
240:55:30 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, we're coming through 17.
240:55:36 Schweickart (onboard): What was that miss distance, Davey?
240:55:39 Scott (onboard): Say again.
240:55:40 Schweickart (onboard): How much did...
240:55:41 McDivitt (onboard): 1 mile.
240:55:42 Schweickart (onboard): 1 mile?
240:55:45 McDivitt (onboard): Master Alarm, what's that...
240:55:46 Scott (onboard): O2 Flow High.
240:55:47 Schweickart (onboard): No sweat.
240:55:48 McDivitt (onboard): Okay. Okay, we're coming up on 12.5, so just prepare for the drogue to come off.
240:55:55 Schweickart (onboard): Okay. Bye-bye, drogues.
240:56:00 Scott (onboard): There go the mains.
The Guadalcanal was on a northerly heading just south of the target point. Standing by for resumption of communications through the relay aircraft; should be getting...
240:56:02 Schweickart (onboard): The mains?
240:56:03 Scott (onboard): Two of them, three of them. There they go. There they go.
240:56:05 McDivitt (onboard): Yes, there they go.
240:56:06 Scott (onboard): Beautiful! Whee!
240:56:07 Schweickart (onboard): Cabin Pressure Release to Closed
240:56:11 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, we got three mains.
240:56:15 Schweickart (onboard): Direct O2, Open.
240:56:16 McDivitt (onboard): Direct O2 is Open.
240:56:17 Schweickart (onboard): Command Module RCS Logic, On.
240:56:19 Scott (onboard): Command Module RCS Logic is On. I'm going to be going through a deck of clouds, it looks like.
240:56:23 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, Command Module Prop, Dump.
240:56:24 McDivitt (onboard): Dump.
240:56:25 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, [garble].
240:56:43 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, we're going through 7.5.
We have voice contact from the Guadalcanal to Apollo 9.
240:57:02 McDivitt (onboard): 7,000.
240:57:28 Schweickart (onboard): Ha, no question about that, huh?
240:57:29 McDivitt (onboard): Okay. No.
240:57:30 Schweickart (onboard): And Purge, On.
240:57:31 McDivitt (onboard): Purge. Okay, two, good.
240:57:40 Airboss 1: Apollo 9, Airboss. Over.
240:57:42 McDivitt (onboard): Hello, Airboss; Apollo 9.
240:57:48 McDivitt (onboard): Airboss, this is Apollo 9. We're going through 5500.
240:57:52 Schweickart (onboard): Floodlights to Postlanding.
240:57:53 Scott (onboard): Floodlights to Postlanding.
240:57:55 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, was that the Purge, Dave?
240:57:57 Scott (onboard): Almost, Rusty.
240:57:59 Schweickart (onboard): Okay.
240:58:00 Airboss 1: Apollo 9, Apollo 9, Airboss. Over.
Recovery 3 helicopter has visual contact. And it's visually in sight from the carrier. Big cheer went up here in the Missions Operations Control Room; as they saw it on the tube; estimate now 3 miles from the ship.
240:58:03 Schweickart (onboard): Airboss, this is Apollo 9. How do you read?
240:58:04 Scott (onboard): Okay, Purge is done now, Rusty.
240:58:05 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, Propellant, two, Off.
240:58:10 Scott (onboard): Okay, two CM RCS Propellant, Off.
240:58:12 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, Cabin Pressure to Boost/Entry.
240:58:17 Scott (onboard): Here comes [garble].
240:58:18 Airboss 1: Apollo 9, Apoilo 9, this is Airboss. We have you visual. We have you visual.
240:58:25 McDivitt (onboard): Good show. Hey, go; they got us a visual, great!
240:58:28 Airboss 1: Control, this is Airboss. A visual contact.
240:58:32 McDivitt (onboard): Alright, standing by for 3000.
240:58:33 Airboss 1: Magnetic bearing 140; time 58:20 - belay that - 210, 3 miles.
240:58:49 Scott (onboard): [Garble]. Hey, which circuit breakers I got to get, Rusty?
240:58:56 Schweickart (onboard): Oh, stand by. That's alright; wait until we get there.
240:58:59 Airboss 1: Control, do you read Airboss?
240:59:00 Scott (onboard): That's affirm.
240:59:01 McDivitt: Hey, Airboss. How do you read Apollo 9?
240:59:03 Airboss 1: Reading you loud and clear.
240:59:04 Airboss 2: Read you loud and clear.
240:59:06 McDivitt: Roger. Feeling pretty good, here; we got three chutes and on the way down to see you; you got that cake ready?
240:59:09 Airboss 1: This is Airboss. I have three main chutes. They are disreefed...
240:59:15 Schweickart (onboard): Standing by for 3000.
240:59:16 Airboss 1: ...Approximately 2 miles from the Command Module, and its altitude is 2500 feet, approximately, at this time.
240:59:17 McDivitt (onboard): There. 3000.
240:59:18 Schweickart (onboard): Cabin Pressure Release to Dump.
240:59:19 Airboss 1: Roger. I have [garble] Roger; I have you in spite of it and we have no contact with the Command Module. Apollo 9, Airboss; we're getting you a little bit broken; Recovery 3 is circling you at this time; you're looking real good; give me your status rate - and its altitude is 2500 feet, approximately, at this time.
240:59:22 Schweickart (onboard): Rotational Control Power Direct, Off.
240:59:25 McDivitt (onboard): What's that?
240:59:26 Schweickart (onboard): Rotational Control Power Direct.
240:59:27 McDivitt (onboard): Rotational Control Power Direct, two, Off.
240:59:28 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, standing by for 1,000 feet.
240:59:29 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
240:59:30 Airboss 1: Apollo 9, Apollo 9, Airboss. Over. Roger, understand; the crew is in good shape. That's correct. Apollo 9, this is Airboss; we're not reading you, stick your propellant dump - stand by.
240:59:31 McDivitt (onboard): Roger; we'll be with you in a second, Airboss; we're presently coming down to about 2000.
240:59:34 Airboss 3: Apollo 9, Apollo 9, Airboss. Over.
240:59:39 McDivitt: This is Apollo 9. If you read me, we won't need a second Airboss. We're presently coming down through 2000.
240:59:41 Schweickart (onboard): Did you get all...
240:59:42 Roosa: Airboss, Recovery B.
240:59:43 Airboss 2: Airboss to 3.
240:59:43 Schweickart (onboard): Dave, did you get your instructions?
240:59:44 Scott (onboard): Yes, I got them [garble].
240:59:45 Airboss 3: Go ahead.
240:59:45 Airboss 1: Go ahead.
240:59:47 Airboss 2: Roger. I am circling Apollo 9, and he is at 15.
240:59:47 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble] passing 1,000 feet?
240:59:49 Airboss 1: Roger; I have you in sight; have received no contact with the...
240:59:50 Scott (onboard): Roger; [garble] supposed to do?
240:59:51 Airboss 1: ...Command Module.
240:59:52 Schweickart (onboard): Cabin Pressure to Closed and Main Bus Tie; that's all.
240:59:55 Airboss 3: Roger. I have you insight, and we have had no contact with the command Bonjour.
240:59:55 McDivitt (onboard): Hello, Airboss; this is Apollo 9. We're reading you loud and clear. How us?
241:00:01 McDivitt: Hello, Airboss. This is Apollo 9, do you read me?
241:00:04 Airboss 1: Apollo 9, this is Airboss. Reception a little bit broken. Recovery 3 is circling you at this time. You are looking real good. Give me your status, please.
241:00:17 McDivitt: We're all fine; we're all good.
241:00:18 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, 1,000 feet, Jim.
241:00:19 McDivitt (onboard): 1,000 feet.
241:00:20 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, Cabin Pressure Relief, Closed.
241:00:21 Airboss 1: Roger; understand. Crew in good shape, is that Charlie?
241:00:22 Scott (onboard): Ready for the Main Bus Ties.
241:00:23 Schweickart (onboard): Main Bus Ties, Off.
241:00:24 Airboss 3: Roger. Understand. The crew is in good shape. Is that correct?
241:00:42 Airboss 1: Apollo 9, this is Airboss. We're not reading you. Check your propellant dump. Stand by.
241:00:56 Airboss 3: Splashdown, this time. Jettison your mains.
241:01:09 Airboss 1: Control, Airboss. Parachute has been jettisoned. Capsule is reading Stable 1 at this time. It looks good.
And we have splash. At 53 seconds past the hour - big cheer and a lot of clapping going on here in mission control.
Airboss: Control, Airboss - Parachute has been jettisoned, capsule is reading stable 1 at this time. Looking good.
The spacecraft is now in stable 1 - that is apex up.
Airboss: Looking good.
Airboss: The spacecraft is now in stable 1 - that is apex up.
Airboss: [garble] Use VHF.
This is Apollo Control. Splashdown time was at 53 seconds past the hour - which is some 10 seconds later than the predicted splash time of 43 seconds past the hour. The estimated range from the carrier to the spacecraft of some 3 nautical miles [5.6 km] - however this does not mean necessarily that the spacecraft was 3 miles off the target point. The carrier Guadalcanal was steaming toward the target point from the south. Recover 3 is going to drop a flare at the spacecraft.
- Cigars are beginning to sprout out of everyone's mouth here in Mission Control. The apex cover and the drogue parachutes are reported near the spacecraft, a considerable amount of jubilation in Mission Control. Standing by here for a word of swimmers in the water. Swimmers are now being deployed from helicopter, 4 miles dead ahead estimate from the Guadalcanal. The helicopter is piloted by Commander George M. Rankin, Jr., of Bethesda, Maryland, copilot Lieutenant Rufus O. Edison, Jr., of Laurel, Mississippi, the crewmen are antisubmarine technicians David E. Morris of Dallas, Texas, and Steven K. Hanigan of East Meadow, New York. Underwater demolition team members, or swimmers, who will be dropped. About 2 minutes away from dropping the swimmers. These swimmers are gunners mate second class Cecil Eubanks, Port Arthur, Texas; Seaman Richard B, Perry, Derry, New Hampshire; Seaman Clay P. Rhyne, of Clinton, Maryland.
Recovery: Airboss, Recovery 1. I'm going down for 330 [garble]. The apex cover is off the head, over.
Airboss: Roger. Recovery 1, are you circling this time?
Recovery: Negative, we are [garble], from the north [garble].
Airboss: All right. Recovery 2, the apex cover is over near the smoke light.
Recovery: Okay, pick up.
Airboss: Fine. [Garble].
Amazingly good communications between the relay aircraft and the spacecraft, also the helicopters.
Guadalcanal steaming north toward the spacecraft some 3 miles dead ahead. First swimmer in the water out of Recovery 3. All three swimmers are now in the water. Among their chores will be deploying the flotation collar, plugging the earphones so they can talk with the crew of Apollo 9.
Airboss: Recovery 3, give me all you've got on antennas. [Garble].
Recovery 3 reports the spacecraft is somewhat scarred but looks rather good.
Airboss: - from here, how about the apex cover lanyard?
Recovery: This is Recovery 3 [garble]
Airboss: Roger.
Airboss: [Garble], this is Airboss. Standby, uprighting bags are not deployed.
Spacecraft: You haven't got the [garble] spacecraft.
Recovery: Roger, 9. [garble] before deploying the [garble] uprighting. says [garble] apex cover. [Garble].
Quite a myriad of voices coming over the loops out there through the various relays, all of which are being passed into the air to ground circuit here in Mission Control. Apparently, it's pretty much of a routine recovery exercise. The spacecraft is in Stable 1. Apex is up, no need for the flotation bags. [Garble].
The flotation collar is now being attached by the swimmers from Recovery 3. These swimmers again, gunners mate second class Cecil Eubanks of Port Arthur, Texas; Seaman Richard B. Perry of Derry, New Hampshire; and Seaman Clay P. Rhyne of Clinton, Maryland.
Airboss: Recovery 1, Airboss.
Recovery: Go ahead, Airboss.
Airboss: Roger. Turn the apex cover - attached to the raft, go ahead...
The flotation collar is almost deployed to the spacecraft. Communications is getting somewhat noisy at this time. We will continue to monitor the relay circuits.
Airboss: This is Airboss. Negative. You worry about the apex cover.
Recovery: Roger.
It is reported that the Guadalcanal is approximately 1 mile from the spacecraft and no doubt slowing down, so as not to overrun the position.
Recovery: And I've got a nice cake waiting for you. Have anything you want.
Recovery: [garble] the collar is on at this time and they are securing the collar at this time.
Airboss: Roger, 5165, stand by.
Spacecraft: Airboss, this is Apollo 9.
Airboss: Go ahead, Apollo 9.
Spacecraft: I've [garble] uprighting bags [garble]
Airboss: Stand by.
Control: Control, Airboss. Apollo 9 wants to know whether or not to pop the uprighting bags, the collar is attached at this time.
The collar, flotation collar has been attached to the spacecraft at this time and the three swimmers from the underwater demolition team out of Recovery 3 helicopter are standing on the flotation collar.
Recovery: Recovery 3, Airboss, the collar inflated yet?
Airboss: Recovery 3, negative. Just got it secured.
Recovery 3 helicopter still hovering over the spacecraft after having unloaded the swimmers earlier for the flotation collar deployment. This Mission Control Room here has quite suddenly gotten rather crowded. Program people, off-duty flight controllers, everyone sprouting a cigar out of their mouth.
Spacecraft: Airboss, this is Apollo 9.
Airboss: Apollo 9, this is Airboss. You are okay, belay your uprighting bags, the collar is inflated around you at this time.
Spacecraft: Roger.
We have confirmation that the flotation collar has been inflated at this time.
Airboss: Recovery 3, the collar is fully inflated and they are getting [garble] at the present time. The Command Module is riding very nicely in the water and all appears to be real good.
Airboss: Recovery 1, what's your status?
Recovery: This is Recovery 1. We are - apex cover ia sort of unlatched at this time. I have a - we should had [garble] apex cover.
Airboss: Roger. Control you copy?
Control: I copy.
Still monitoring the conversation with 1 on scene.
Airboss: - Airboss. Do not deploy your uprighting bags, over.
Spacecraft: Roger, Airboss.
Airboss: Recovery 3, you copy Apollo 9?
Recovery: 3 [garble]
Airboss: Guadalcanal Control, be advised that Apollo 9...
Spacecraft: Do not deploy uprighting bags?
Airboss: Apollo 9, that affirmative. We do not want you to deploy the bags.
Spacecraft: Roger.
Control: Rhyne, this is Control. Have you [garble]
Spacecraft: Hello, this is Apollo 9. You really look good to us.
Control: Roger. You look pretty good to us too - did you dump your fuel on the way down?
Spacecraft: Roger, that's affirm, on the way down.
Control: Real fine.
Airboss: Recovery 3, two of the [garble] are securing [garble] on the collar [garble] just put the others up now.
Recovery: This is Recovery 1. The swimmers have called for another [garble] second man off the water. We are going to have some, [garble] on it [garble] we can't get the thing in the [garble].
Airboss: Roger.
Recovery: Recovery 3, the Guadalcanal is a quarter of a mile.
Airboss: We see. She's still coming in. Recommend you move to starboard.
Here in Mission Control everyone is standing up watching all the big screens in front of the Control Room where commercial television has the spacecraft floating in the water, a 10 by 20 Eidophor background projectors in the television picture.
Airboss: That's affirmative, go on, over.
Recovery: Roger, swimmers, go ahead, over.
Airboss: Boss, [garble].
Recovery: still needs the swimmers.
Control: Roger.
Recovery: [Garble] to Airboss, over.
Airboss: Swimmers, okay.
Control: Loud and clear, Airboss. They are trying to talk to you and they are talking to Apollo 9. This is Control. [Garble].
Airboss: Apollo 9, Apollo 9, secure your SARAH beacon. Over.
Spacecraft: We have already secured the beacon.
Spacecraft: Beacon is off.
Airboss: Roger, thank you. I need [garble] for my radio.
Recovery: Airboss, we have 2 seven-man rafts in the water now.
Among the people here in Mission Control observing the activities out in the area of the Guadalcanal are Dr. George E. Mueller, the Office of Manned Space Flight, Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, NASA headquarters; Samuel Phillips, Apollo Program Director; Mr. George Hage, Apollo 9 Houston Director; Dr. Robert R. Gilruth, Director of the Manned Spacecraft Center; and it looks like the viewing room behind Mission Control is quite full of people, quite a few astronauts down around CapCom's console including Pete Conrad, Deke Slayton, Stu Roosa, Al Bean. All of the medics are lined up around their console. We'll rejoin the Airboss/spacecraft communications in progress.
Recovery: This is Recovery 1. Over 2 pieces of some material that came out over the apex cover.
Airboss: Roger.
Recovery: A plastic type liner.
Airboss: Roger.
HELO :This is Helo I. [Garble] we'll get back down on it if we can.
Airboss: [Garble] Roger.
The voice identifying itself as is owned by Lt. Commander James A. McGee of Atlanta, Georgia, pilot of the aircraft. Swimmers out of still are apparently keeping the apex cover, which enclosed the parachute deck, still keeping it afloat.
Airboss: [Garble] now the first life raft. Now they are being secured to the collar at the present time.
Recovery: This is Recovery. We feel it's safe and I believe the hatch will be opened.
Recovery: Apollo 9, Apollo 9. (garbled)
Recovery: Control, Recovery 3, the hatch is now open on Apollo 9.
Airboss: Recovery 3, Roger.
Recovery: The first astronaut is now egressing from Apollo 9 into the life raft and he has his water wings on.
Airboss: Roger, got him tally ho.
Recovery: First astronaut is in the water - in the raft.
Airboss: Roger, air control, Roger.
Recovery: This is Recovery 3. Second astronaut is egressing from Apollo 9.
Airboss: Control here, Roger.
Astronauts McDivitt, Schweickart and Scott presently egressing the spacecraft into their raft. Some amount of laughter here as one of the rafts turns over, not the one the crewmen are in, but one of the empty ones flips over on top. Downwash from one of the helicopters apparently caused the raft to flip over.
Two out, one to go. Now that the crew is out of the spacecraft the communications through the Airboss will cease. We'll continue to give reports from the Guadalcanal as the crew is brought on to the ship and later the spacecraft. All three crewmen are now in rafts.
Still standing by here for crew pick up and consequently - or subsequently - the pick up of Apollo 9 Command Module.
They are presently establishing a circuit out to the Guadalcanal from the White House. The swimmers are now securing the Command Module hatch, closing it from the outside.
Recovery Aircraft 3 flown by Commander George M. Rankin, Jr. of Bethesda, Maryland, is apparently making a run to pick up the crewmen. They're lowering the basket now to pick up the first crewman. Everyone in Mission Control still watching the three big 10 by 20 foot screens - all three of which have the same picture from the commercial television on board Guadalcanal. First attempt in getting the crewmen in the recovery hoist apparently was aborted. Recovery 3 still hovering over the spacecraft attempting to get the recovery hoist and cage out to the rafts without crowning anyone in the head. The down wash from the helicopter makes things a little more complicated in that it disturbs the water - makes the spacecraft drift a little more and consequently away from the recovery sling. There goes one crewman in the sling - hanging on for dear life - like the flying trapeze. Considerable amount of guffawing here as all this takes place. Someone commented it's like a Max Sinnett comedy.
This is Apollo Control. We'll come up again as the crew is on the Guadalcanal and the spacecraft is recovered. At 241 hours, 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and 1 hour and 9 minutes after Retrofire this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control. All three crewmen are aboard the recovery helicopter and are anticipated to be on board the Guadalcanal within a few moments. Announcement of the post-recovery press conference times will be forthcoming. This is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control. In the large center screen here in Mission Control, a three-color patch for Apollo 9 has been projected on the screen and it brought a rousing cheer from everyone in the Control Room here. There must be 150 people crowded in here. A lot of handshaking going on; a lot of cigar smoke wafting up to the ceiling. We're waiting now for the crew to leave the helicopter on board the Guadalcanal. The helicopter touched down on deck about 10 minutes prior to 12 o'clock Central Standard Time. The Management Press Conference will take place in the Manned Spacecraft Center main auditorium at 12:15, followed immediately thereafter with the Operations people in a second press conference. This is Apollo Control signing off.
