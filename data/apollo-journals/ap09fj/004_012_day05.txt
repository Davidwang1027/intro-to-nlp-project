GUAM (REV 54)
085:40:24 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Good morning. [Pause]
085:40:34 Scott: Good morning.
085:40:36 Evans: A real short night. [Long pause]
085:40:56 Evans: 9, Houston. About 30 seconds to LOS. I'll pick you up at Mercury at 53, and I'll probably have some flight plan updates for you there.
Very long comm break.
Apparently we have had loss of signal at the tracking station at Guam. As Ron Evans mentioned just before his LOS call, he did say that there will be flight plan update during the pass at Mercury. This pass is some 5 minutes long and it is likely that only the first portion or the beginning of the flight plan update will be likely during this brief 5 minute pass. However, later on in Ascension at the beginning of the next revolution there appears to be something like 7 minutes of tracking and communication and then back to Guam again but during this period the crew of course will be eating breakfast. At 85 hours 42 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 85 hours 53 minutes GET. Apollo 9 is within a few seconds of being picked up at the tracking ship Mercury. We'll wait until spacecraft communicator, Ron Evans, begins talking to the crew. During the Guam pass, Dave Scott was apparently awake at the time Evans made the call. He mentioned that there might would be the beginning at least of the flight plan update during this pass over Mercury. We're some 30 seconds into acquisition here. Generally, the CAPCOM waits for a good solid lockon before making his call. As mentioned earlier, the commander and lunar module pilot will not be fully suited for the transfer into the lunar module. They will have on their pressure garments, but without the helmets and gloves or the long umbilicals. There goes the call now.
MERCURY (REV 54)
085:54:37 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Mercury.
085:54:41 Scott: Apollo 9. Go ahead.
085:54:44 Evans: Roger, Dave. On your H2 tanks today: after you've completed the H2 fan cycle, lock tank 1 heater in AUTO and tank 2 heater OFF. [Pause]
085:55:05 Scott: Okay. Tank 1 heater at AUTO and tank 2 heater OFF, and you want us to run through the cycle again, is that right?
085:55:10 Evans: Yes, that's after you've completed the fan cycle ON. [Pause]
085:55:26 Scott: Okay. What else do you have?
085:55:27 Evans: Okay. I have some flight plan updates here, and are you ready to copy?
085:55:31 Scott: Roger. Let's go ahead.
085:55:32 Evans: Okay. Page rendezvous-1: transfer sequence camera that malfunctioned during EVA to LM; leave best camera in command nodule. Over. [Pause]
085:56:01 Scott: Roger. I understand. Transfer the malfunction sequence camera to LM and leave the good one in the command module.
085:56:07 Evans: Roger. Okay. And rendezvous-38, add: transfer the extra sequence camera fuse from LM to command module. Fuse is in LM data card kit. [Long pause]
085:56:47 Scott: Okay. Transfer the camera fuse from the LM to the command module in the LM data card kit.
085:56:54 Evans: Roger. And at time 104 plus 00, waste water dump. [Pause]
085:57:06 Scott: 104 plus 00, waste water dump.
085:57:09 Evans: Okay. And then you might note that the LM must be in high hit rate to update the AGS state vector from PGNCS. [Long pause]
085:57:36 Evans: And, 9, Houston.
085:57:39 Scott: Roger. We hear; I guess we learned that one the other day.
085:57:42 Evans: Yes.
085:57:43 Scott: I'm just making sure.
085:57:44 Evans: Okay; just making sure. And we're been talking it over down here and you have a GO to transfer to the LM without being connected to the command module umbilicals. That is, you can make the transfer with your helmets and gloves off, if you to desire. Might save a little time, there. [Pause]
085:58:01 Scott: Okay. Thank you. We'll do that.
085:58:03 Evans: Okay. [Long pause]
085:58:18 Evans: 9, Houston. We noticed the AUTO switchover to REG 2, and we'd like you to go back to number 1.
085:58:26 Scott: Well, that's very observant of you. We will do that.
085:58:27 McDivitt (onboard): Okay. Roger. We'll do that.
085:58:30 Evans: Okay.
085:58:34 Evans: And we're just about LOS. Ascension at 27. And you might be thinking about it - We can use the rundown on the crew health, sleep, and pills taken in the last couple of days, if you can give it to us there. [Pause]
085:58:49 McDivitt: Okay. Let me ask you a question with the radiators there. Do you think we have a problem, or what?
085:58:57 Evans: We don't know yet, at this time, but I don't think so.
085:59:01 McDivitt: Okay. It's manually and - No, it's not a manual radiator operation, but the automatic switch is in RADIATOR 1 now. Okay.
085:59:08 Evans: Okay.
Very long comm break.
085:59:30 McDivitt (onboard): Houston, [garble] Apollo 9.
And this is Apollo Control. Apparently we have had LOS at the Mercury, however, the conversation did continue past the advertised time of LOS. During that pass the command module pilot, Dave Scott, discussed with spacecraft communicator, Ron Evans, here in Mission Control some of the procedures to be followed in preparations for the rendezvous. Some troubleshooting on the malfunction sequence camera involving retrieving camera fuse in the LM and on taking it back to the CSM, and also the crew optional go for transferring to the lunar module without helmet and gloves or umbilical was passed up and accepted rather enthusiastically by command module pilot, Dave Scott. At 86 hours GET, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 86 hours 27 minutes ground elapse time. Coming up on the Ascension Island tracking station in the South Atlantic, during this pas is anticipated that the crew of Apollo 9 will give a food and medical report and perhaps a continuation of the flight plan update will be passed to the crew by the mission control center here. We're standing by for the first call. Here we go.
ASCENSION (REV 55)
086:27:57 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Ascension. And I have a consumables update.
086:28:05 Scott: Roger, Houston. Stand by.
086:28:08 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
086:28:37 Scott: Okay, Houston. Go with the consumables
086:28:40 Evans: Roger. GET 086 70 21 69 27 72 29 67 29 450 36 37 34 39 100 97 26 0820 588. Over. [Long pause]
086:30:34 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Did you copy?
086:30:39 Scott: Roger. I missed the third and fourth from the bottom. The percent RCS-B and descent ponds O2.
086:30:48 Evans: Roger. Percent RCS systems B remaining 97; O2 is 26. [Pause]
086:31:02 Scott: Roger. Coming back; are you ready?
086:31:04 Evans: Roger. Go fast.
086:31:07 Scott: 086 70 21 69 27 72 29 67 29 450 36 37 34 39 100 97 26 0820 588.
086:31:29 Evans: 9, Houston. Your readback is correct. On that radiator flow control, we'd like to go back to AUTO now and see if it stays in 1.
086:31:43 Scott: Okay. It did. [Pause]
086:31:55 Scott: Houston, 9, you read?
086:31:57 Evans: Affirmative. You say you went to AUTO?
086:32:00 Scott: That's affirm, and we're still in 1.
086:32:02 Evans: Roger. We copy.
086:32:05 Evans: And, 9, Houston. Did you get request there on the - your crew stratus when you get a chance?
086:32:12 Scott: Roger. [Pause]
086:32:18 Scott: Okay, I myself feel fine. Been eating good - no pills and got about 5 hours sleep last night.
086:32:26 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
086:33:00 Evans: Dave, I guess we missed the sleep here night before, also, if you can remember that. [Long pause]
086:33:40 Scott: Houston, 9. Are you still with us?
086:33:41 Evans: 9, go. Roger.
086:33:42 Scott: Okay. Night before last I got about 7 hours sleep, too.
086:33:50 Evans: Roger. Okay. I've got yours now.
086:33:53 Scott: Okay. Did you get everybody?
086:33:54 Evans: Negative. I just got yours and that's all.
086:33:58 Scott: Really? Okay. I guess I'll let Jim give you a run down on he and Rusty again.
086:34:04 Evans: Okay. [Pause]
086:34:13 Evans: If you're talking, Jim, I'm not reading you.
086:34:17 Scott: Are you reading us now, Houston?
086:34:18 Evans: I read you, Dave.
086:34:21 Scott: Okay. Let me check my friends here. [Pause]
086:34:31 McDivitt: Houston, how do you read?
086:34:33 Evans: I got you now, Dave, - Jim; about 40 seconds to LOS. In Guam at 08. [Pause]
086:34:40 McDivitt: Okay. I took an Actifed and two APC before I went to bed last night and the night before. I got 7 hours sleep the night before last, and 5 hours last night. Rusty took the Seconal last night, nothing the night before, and he got 7 hours and 5 hours.
086:34:54 Evans: Okay. Thank you.
Very long comm break.
And this is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal at the Ascension Island tracking station. During that pass we had apparently minor communications problem aboard the spacecraft where McDivitt could not get through in talking to the ground until the last few seconds before LOS and he crammed into those few seconds the medical and sleep reports on himself and Schweickart. Scott reported that he had 5 hours sleep last night, 7 hours the night before, is eating well and is taking no medication. McDivitt when he did come on the line reported that he had taken 1 actifed, and 2 APC's and had 7 hours sleep last night, 5 hours the night before. Schweickart took 1 Seconal and had 7 hours sleep last night, 5 hours the night before. Apollo 9 will next be acquired by the tracking station at Guam. At 8 minutes past the hour for an 8 minute pass actually 7 minutes 46 seconds according to the table fairly high elevation I hope. Following that it'll go almost directly over head actually within 3/10ths of a degree of directly over head of Mercury in the South Pacific. At 86 hours 37 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 87 hours 8 minutes GET. A few seconds away from acqusition at the Guam tracking station in the West Pacific. We'll have almost continuous coverage here over the Guam, Huntsville, the tracking ship Huntsville, and tracking ship Mercury, with a few seconds drop-out between each station. Standing by here for acquisition and the subsequent conversation between Ron Evans here at Mission Control, and the crew of Apollo 9. There goes the call now.
GUAM (REV 55)
087:09:18 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Guam. [Pause]
087:09:27 Scott: Roger, Houston, 9. Go.
087:09:30 Evans: Roger. Davey. Tell Rusty we've got another new set of GO/NO-GO limits for rendezvous radar check after RCS SEP. Do you want to copy them down? [Pause]
087:09:46 Scott: Okay. Stand by. [Long pause]
087:10:41 Evans: 9, Houston. While you're digging out books there, I've got some block data for you also.
087:10:45 Scott: Okay. Give me the PAD's first.
087:10:49 Evans: Okay. On VERB 83 versus VERB 62, rendezvous radar check after RCS SEP: page 2 and LMP and CDR, rendezvous procedures; change limits R plus or minus 0.27 nautical miles; R dot plus or minus 6.0 feet per second. Over. [Long pause]
087:11:37 Scott: Roger. Understand. VERB 83 versus VERB 62, rendezvous radar check: page 2 and LMP and CDR, rendezvous; change limits R plus or minus 0.27 nautical miles; R dot plus or minus 6.0 feet per second.
087:11:53 Evans: Roger. These are the ones we had before flight. We didn't get a change to stick in your book there, so you can use your own ideas on them.
087:12:02 Scott: Okay. Fine.
087:12:05 Scott: What next?
087:12:06 Evans: Okay. I've got the block data, but before we go into that, it looks like your primary radiator outlet temperature was up to 51 degrees, so it was a valid switch to slow propulsion number 2. And we're still checking it to see what causes it, other than that.
087:12:26 Scott: Okay. Fine. Looks like it's up to about 47 or so degrees now.
087:12:31 Evans: Okay.
087:12:33 Scott: Thank you. [Pause]
087:12:40 Scott: Do you want a block data now?
087:12:41 Evans: Affirmative. If you're ready.
087:12:43 Scott: Just a minute; give me 10 seconds. [Pause]
087:13:00 Scott: Okay, Ron. Go ahead.
087:13:02 Evans: Okay. Area 057 Alpha Charlie, plus 115, minus 0319 089 19 18 4094; 058 2 Alpha, plus 263, minus 0270 090 5537 4094; 059 Alpha Charlie, plus 322, minus 0279 092 29 25 4094; 060 1 Alpha, plus 294, minus 0629 093 55 38 4094; 06l 1 Bravo, plus 335, minus 0629 095 29 25 4094; 062 1 Bravo, plus 327, minus 0625 097 0312 4094; 063 1 Alpha, plus 272, minus 0630 098 3715 4094. Pitch trim minus 1.07; yaw minus 1.12; and this reflects - no - I say again, no rendezvous maneuvers. [Pause]
087:16:18 Evans: 9. Houston. About 20 seconds LOS; Huntsville at 17.
087:16:27 Scott: Okay. I'll read them back to you when we get there. Okay?
087:16:31 Evans: Sure.
087:16:33 Scott: I think I've got them all, and understand reflects no rendezvous maneuvers.
087:16:37 Evans: Roger.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal at Guam, we have a 32 second gap between Guam loss of signal and Huntsville acquisition of signal. During that pass, the crew was passed up some different numbers for the check out of the rendezvous radar, after the separation burn of the command module for the start of the mini football, and the first of several maneuvers in the rendezvous sequence. Also block data for the several planned landing areas, so that the crew would have on board the necessary information for contingency landing in the next several revolutions if necessary. These are routinely passed to the crew from time to time. It appears that we've have had acquisition again with the Apollo 9 spacecraft through the tracking ship Huntsville. We'll stand by for continuation of the conversation. Spacecraft communicator Ron Evans is leaning over flight director Pete Frank's console discussing a point prior to resuming conversation. Flight director and the spacecraft communicator are still discussing some point that they plan to pass up to the crew over Huntsville. Although we have had acquisition, the discussion has not resumed. Standing by to come up with the conversation when it does begin. Spacecraft communicator is jotting down notes from his discussion with the flight director prior to continuing the conversation with Apollo 9 through Huntsville, anticipating momentarily the familiar beep-beep as the spacecraft communicator keys his microphone.
HUNTSVILLE (REV 55)
087:20:59 Evans: Apollo 9. Houston over Huntsville. [Pause]
087:21:14 Communications Technician: Houston, Huntsville lost a valid lock temporarily. [Long pause]
087:22:20 Communications Technician: Huntsville LOS. [Long pause]
087:23:09 Communications Technician: Huntsville valid two-way. [Long pause]
087:23:36 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Looks like we got about one and a half minutes LOS; we'll pick you up at Mercury at 26.
087:23:46 Schweickart: Roger. Mercury at 26, and you want me to read back some block data.
087:23:50 Evans: Roger, I can reed you good enough. Go ahead. I'll get what I can. [Pause]
087:23:54 Schweickart: Okay. 57 Alpha Charlie, plus 115, minus 0319 089 19 18 0094; 058 2 Alpha, plus 263, minus 0270 090 55 37 0094; 054 1 Alpha Charlie, plus 322, minus 0279 092 29 25 0094; 060 1 Alpha, plus 294, minus 0629 093 55 38 4094.
087:24:54 Evans: Houston...
087:24:55 Schweickart: Houston, are you still with us?
087:24:56 Evans: Roger. I got you right now, but we're just about to get you - about 30 seconds yet so - We'll catch the rest of them over Mercury. [Long pause]
087:25:32 Scott: And I think we've lost you.
Comm break.
And we have had loss of signal at the tracking ship Huntsville with a dropout of some 36 seconds here before picking up at Mercury again. The pass over Mercury will be then 3 degrees of directly overhead or our zenith pass and because of the mechanical considerations of the antenna onboard the Mercury as it reaches the zenith, it'll be a few seconds dropout as they swivel the antenna around and relock with Apollo 9. On a lower elevation angle this would not be necessary, but apparently the antenna's gimballing system is built in such a manner that the antenna must be rotated around on our zenith pass. We show Mercury acquisition at - should take place at about now. We are standing by for resumption of the conversation.
MERCURY (REV 55)
087:26:57 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Mercury.
087:27:00 Schweickart: Roger, Houston. Where'd we dropout?
087:27:03 Evans: Okay. Start with area 61.
087:27:07 Schweickart: Okay. 061 1 Bravo, plus 335, minus 0629 095 29 25 4094; 062 1 Bravo, plus 327, minus 0625 097 03 12 4094; 063 1 Alpha, plus 272, minus 0630 098 37 15 4094. Pitch trim minus 1.07; yaw trim minus 1.11; and no rendezvous maneuver.
087:27:56 Evans: Roger, Rusty. Your yaw trim there was minus 1.12, and this reflects no rendezvous maneuvers.
087:28:07 Schweickart: I got you.
087:28:09 Schweickart: Does that reflect the SEP burn at all?
087:28:13 Evans: That's negative.
087:28:16 Schweickart: Negative on the set burn also. Right?
087:28:19 Evans: Yes. You're sounding pretty chipper this morning.
087:28:22 Schweickart: Yes man, we is hustling.
087:28:25 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9.
087:28:27 Evans: Houston, Go.
087:28:29 McDivitt: Roger. If we can get into the LM a little early, I'd like to do it. Would you check to see what the descent battery power is right now, and see if we've got the margin to get in there a little early?
087:28:41 Evans: Roger. We'll check it, and let you know. [Long pause]
087:29:23 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. Roger. There's no problem on descent batteries.
087:29:28 McDivitt: Okay. Thank you. [Long pause]
087:29:57 Evans: Apollo 9. Houston. About 30 seconds LOS, We'll pick you up Ascension at 02 - 03.
Long comm break.
087:33:04 McDivitt: Roger. [Long pause]
087:33:42 Scott: Okay.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We've had LOS at the tracking ship, Mercury. The next station to acquire spacecraft Apollo 9 will be the Ascension tracking station, at 2 minutes 55 seconds past the hour, Apollo 9 is over the South Central Pacific nearing the end of the 55th revolution. At 87 hours 34 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control. 88 hours 2 minutes ground-elapse time. Coming into acquisition at the tracking station at Ascension Island in the South Atlantic. This will be a very low elevation angle pass. 1.9 degrees on a total time of 3 minutes 45 seconds. It's unlikely that a whole lot of conversation will take place over this tracking station however we will monitor and break in live for any possible conversation. The crew at this time are probably suiting up for a transfer to the lunar module. As mentioned earlier they will not wear the gloves and helmets nor use the long umbilicals for transfering to the lunar module.
ASCENSION (REV 56)
088:03:30 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Ascension. Standing by.
088:03:36 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Houston, Gumdrop.
088:03:40 Evans: Roger.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control. Not a very informative pass. Mostly line noise. One brief exchange between spacecraft communicator Ron Evans and the crew of Apollo 9. We'll continue to monitor for the less than 1 minute remaining in this pass.
088:05:48 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
088:05:52 Scott (Gumdrop): Go ahead, Houston.
088:05:53 Evans: Lousy COMM here. About 45 seconds to AOS Guam at 44 [garble]. [Pause]
088:06:01 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Thank you [garble].
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. Although we have not yet had loss of signal, some 20 seconds of remaining doesn't seem very feasible to remain with the circuit open with all of that background noise. Apollo 9 will be picked up next over the tracking station at Guam at 43 minutes past the hour. At 88 hours 6 minutes ground elapse time this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 88 hours 43 GET. Apollo 9 approaching a sequence of passes over tracking stations Guam, Huntsville, tracking ship Huntsville and the ship Mercury. This will be the last pass of the evening over Guam and Huntsville, however we have about 3 more over Mercury before the orbital track moves out away from the Mercury. There will be some 3 minutes laps between Guam and Huntsville, and some 2 minutes between Huntsville and Mercury. We'll stand by for communications over Guam. It's a fairly low elevation angle pass, some 3 degrees, or a total time of 4 minutes 59 seconds. Standing by for that first call from spacecraft communicator Ron Evans to Apollo 9. Flight director Pete Frank has been advised that data is coming in, here goes the call.
GUAM (REV 56)
088:45:22 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Guam. Standing by.
088:45:26 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Houston, Apollo 9.
088:45:28 Evans: Roger. Loud and clear.
088:45:33 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, how do you feel about the Gumdrop today putting the evap secondary water flow control to AUTO?
088:45:41 Evans: Roger. We copy. Stand by. [Pause]
088:45:49 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, Apollo 9.
088:45:52 Evans: Houston. Go.
088:45:54 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. In case you wonder where we are, we're on page 10, rendezvous 10 of the checklist. It looks like we're running about an hour ahead of schedule.
088:46:03 Evans: Roger. That's good. [Long pause]
088:46:24 Evans: Spider, Houston. High bit rate. [Long pause]
088:47:21 Evans: 9, Houston.
088:47:23 Scott (Gumdrop): Go ahead.
088:47:28 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
Comm break.
088:49:30 Scott (Gumdrop): Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 9.
088:49:32 Evans: Roger. We concur with the evap water control to AUTO for Gumdrop.
088:49:38 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Did you concur?
088:49:40 Evans: Affirmative.
088:49:41 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Thank you. [Long pause]
088:50:20 Evans: Spider and Gumdrop. Thirty seconds LOS. Huntsville at 52, and low bit rata for Spider.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control. Apparently we have had loss of signal at the tracking station Guam. During the brief exchange over that station, spacecraft commander Jim McDivitt reported that he and Schweickart were approximately an hour ahead in the lunar module rendezvous check list. We're less than 3 minutes away from acqusition at the tracking station, tracking ship Huntsville. We'll keep the circuit up until we do have acquisition and rejoin the conversation over that station, and the subsequent pass over tracking ship Mercury. During the earlier shift, prior to this one here in Mission Control, a large box of sandwiches was brought in, courtesy of the Nassau Bay Baptist Church. The mission commentator exercised a certain amount of manners by eating the last of the sandwiches. We're expecting acquisition at Huntsville at 51 minutes 50 seconds past the hour, about a minute away. The flight dynamics people here at Mission Control are busy generating maneuver tables for the series of maneuvers in the rendezvous sequence. It is not expected, at least from the displays here that the rendezvous will differ to greatly from the pre-mission flight plans, however the times and thrust values will be changed somewhat. About 20 seconds out of Huntsville now, standing by for the first call. We hear some conversation down in the mud so to speak. Sounds like Gumdrop and Spider are talking. Let's listen in although Ron Evans has not called the spacecraft.
HUNTSVILLE (REV 56)
088:51:38 Schweickart (Spider): Why don't we go back and try B?
088:51:40 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Go B.
088:51:45 McDivitt (Spider): Five square on B.
088:51:49 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay.
088:51:53 McDivitt (Spider): Now I don't read you. [Pause]
088:52:07 Scott (Gumdrop): Rusty, did you check all the plugs and stuff? Why don't you unplug and replug?
088:52:09 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. [Long pause]
088:52:20 Schweickart (Spider): Hang on.
088:52:21 Scott (Gumdrop): Try it anyway. [Long pause]
088:52:57 Scott (Gumdrop): Loud and clear.
088:53:01 McDivitt (Spider): Hey, try mine too, will you? [Pause]
088:53:14 McDivitt (Spider): Okay.
088:53:16 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, we can configure both the radio over here. [Long pause]
088:54:02 Scott (Gumdrop): Loud and clear.
088:54:06 Schweickart (Spider): How now?
088:54:08 Scott (Gumdrop): Loud and clear.
088:54:09 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. It looks like yours works, Jim.
088:54:13 Scott (Gumdrop): Well, I'll be a son of a gun. I wonder what makes something like that fail?
088:54:18 Scott (Gumdrop): I don't know. It's weird, isn't it?
088:54:19 Schweickart (Spider): Maybe [garble] to adjust it.
088:54:22 Schweickart (Spider): Let's get back on the VOX.
088:54:23 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Pause]
088:54:27 Schweickart (Spider): Going off the air. Need another minute.
088:54:28 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. [Pause]
088:54:33 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Huntsville. We copied there, but we don't know what you're having trouble with.
088:54:39 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay, Houston, this is Apollo 9. Apparently both the push to talk buttons on the LMP side of the LM have failed. The one on the cable and also the one on the hand control failed and the only mode of transmission that he had was VOX. [Pause]
088:54:58 Evans: Roger. We'll copy. We'll see if we can't do some troubleshooting for you.
088:55:04 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. We checked out the CDR's side and it seems to work okay.
088:55:10 Evans: Roger. Copy, Spider. [Long pause]
088:55:36 Scott (Gumdrop): Reading you loud and clear. [Pause]
088:55:51 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Stand by on A. I'll try the other antenna here for you.
088:55:55 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. How do you read now?
088:55:56 Evans: Five-square. [Pause]
088:56:08 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay.
088:56:10 Schweickart (Spider): I'm on the right.
Comm break.
088:56:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] COMM checks incomplete, and I guess the only thing we found is that my PTT doesn't seem to work at all. Let me try it one more time here.
088:56:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, how do you read now? Gumdrop, how do you read, Spider? Gumdrop, how do you read Spider?
088:57:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] it doesn't work on PTT. Now interestingly enough, Jim - [garble] over to a [garble] Spider [garble] I went to - I'm on VOX now [garble] is that the intercom bus should not be triggered [garble]. The tape recorder does not go off. It looks like there's something funny, too. [Garble] I'm sorry. [Garble] on VOX, and on VOX the intercom bus should not be triggered except when I'm talking. [Garble]. The tape is going off now.
088:57:16 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. One minute to LOS. Mercury at 00.
088:57:20 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger [Pause]
088:57:29 Schweickart (Spider): It appears that the intercom has [garble] triggered, and yet the tape recorder does not go off. It looks like there's something funny there, too. I'm sorry; I am on VOX, and on VOX the intercom button should not be triggered except when I'm talking and yet the tape recorder does not go off.
088:57:58 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Pause]
088:58:06 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. The tape has gone off now. [Pause]
088:58:19 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Data. [Pause]
088:58:25 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Received your telemetry well.
088:58:30 Schweickart (Spider): [Garble] VOX sensitivity set.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We're in a gap between the tracking ship Huntsville and the ship Mercury. Approximately 2 minutes gap. We'll stand by until the conversation resumes over the Mercury. During the Huntsville pass it was reported that by the crew that the lunar module pilot was having some difficulty with his intercom buttons. The push to talk buttons on the hand controller and he could only speak with the so called VOX mode that is voice actuated microphone. They're doing some trouble shooting here to, in the mission control to see how best to help out the crew. Here goes air to ground again.
MERCURY (REV 56)
088:59:57 Scott (Gumdrop): [Garble] mess around [garble]. [Pause]
089:00:16 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. I guess I might as well leave all that aside.
089:00:19 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Just a minute. [Long pause]
089:00:39 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Mercury. Standing by for P00 in ACCEPT.
089:00:44 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. You have P00 in ACCEPT.
089:00:48 Schweickart (Spider): And Spider is on also, Houston.
089:00:52 Evans: Roger. Got you, Spider.
Comm break.
089:02:03 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, Spider.
089:02:05 Evans: Spider, Houston. Go.
089:02:06 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. For your information the commander is - OSC is 5600 psi. I'm checking them out right now, so I'll read you the stuff [Long pause]
089:02:17 Evans: Okay. Go. [Long pause]
089:02:51 Evans: Spider, Houston.
089:02:54 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Go ahead.
089:02:55 Evans: Roger. We'd like your CSM to LM power transfer time.
089:03:03 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. I think Gumdrop can probably give that to you a little bit better. [Pause]
089:03:14 Evans: Roger.
089:03:16 Schweickart (Spider): An hour ahead, Houston. That's pretty good; that's within 5 minutes.
089:03:20 Evans: Okay. We'll take that.
089:03:22 Scott (Gumdrop): That's a good number. [Pause]
089:03:28 Evans: And I have your rendezvous PADS down there for the Spider and Gumdrop, if you're ready to copy.
089:03:36 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop's got to stand by.
089:03:38 McDivitt (Spider): What is it you want to give us, Houston?
089:03:41 Evans: Your rendezvous PAD for your DAP data load. [Pause]
089:03:54 Schweickart (Spider): Stand by. Spider too. Gumdrop, let me know when you're ready.
089:03:58 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Long pause]
089:04:45 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Spider is ready to copy anything you've got there, Houston.
089:04:53 Evans: Okay, Spider ready. Gumdrop, are you ready? [Pause]
089:05:08 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, before we start on this [garble] is [garble] that you're going to give us?
089:05:13 Evans: Roger. This is your rendezvous PAD for your DAP data loads, CSM weight, and trim angles. [Pause]
089:05:24 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Gumdrop's ready.
089:05:29 Evans: Roger. I'll go. CSM weight: 27 009; LM weight 22 145; for Spider, GDA drive angles R1: pitch, 00428; roll, 00730; CSM trim angles: pitch, minus 1.00; yaw, minus 1.10; DELTA-VC, 16.1. Over. [Pause]
089:06:18 Evans: That's - I'm sorry, that's SPS tail-off instead of DELTA-VC. [Pause]
089:06:24 Scott (Gumdrop): And, Houston, would you repeat the CSM weight, please?
089:06:27 Evans: CSM weight; 27 009.
089:06:34 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Readback on the LM weight.
089:06:35 Evans: Let's...
089:06:36 Schweickart (Spider): LM weight: 22 145; CSM weight: 27 009; Spider trim angles are plus 00428, 00730.
089:06:55 Evans: Houston. Roger.
089:06:56 Scott (Gumdrop): And for the Gumdrop, I have pitch trim of minus 1.00, yaw trim of minus 1.10, DELTA-V tail-off at 16.1.
089:07:07 Evans: Roger. Spider, you might make sure your LMP audio control switch is in NORMAL.
089:07:15 Schweickart (Spider): Did you get that, Gumdrop?
089:07:17 Scott (Gumdrop): Negative. He faded on me, too.
089:07:19 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. [Long pause]
089:07:49 Evans: Spider, Houston. Low bit rate.
Very long comm break.
And this is Apollo Control. Apparently, we have had LOS at Mercury. During that pass over tracking ship Mercury, it was reported by spacecraft commander, Jim McDivitt, that the transfer power from the CSM umbilical to the lunar module power source was approximately 1 hour earlier than called for in the flight plan. Apollo 9 is nearing the end of 56th revolution. The next station to acquire Apollo 9 will be Canary Islands station, at 39 minutes past the hour, some thirty-one minutes from this point. At 89 hours 08 minutes GET, this is Apollo Control.
089:34:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, tape, in case you're working, I'd like you to know that the window shades in the LM are no damn good. They - they let in too much light for one thing; and, for another thing, they're extremely difficult to reinstall after you've taken them down one time.
089:34:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): And when you take them down, then they don't roll up.
089:34:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, and I guess we ought to also say a few other things here. When we put in the LDC DSKY circuit breaker, it turned out that even though we'd gone to STANDBY on the - system stage, we were not in STANDBY when we pushed in the LDC DSKY circuit breaker. It came up with a flashing 37 in P06, and what else have we got? The commander's OPS heater circuit breaker - or, heater test flight seemed to be either inoperative or intermittent, depending, on which time you do them. I couldn't get them to work at all today. They didn't work for me the other day, but Jim did it one time and it worked. Also, the - yes, excuse me - LMP PTT, either umbilical or on the ACA, is inoperative today, and the only way I can transmit is with the VOX, which works fine. Okay, tape, and you're going OFF at 89:36. 2, 1 -
089:36:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
089:36:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 89:36 and you're going OFF.
This is Apollo Control, 89 hours 39 minutes GET. Apollo 9 is now over the mid-Atlantic approaching the Canary Islands tracking station in a few seconds. This pass over Canary overlaps the lower edge of the Madrid station the first time today, for a total pass of the two stations of some 9 minutes duration. We'll stand by for a call by spacecraft communicator, Stu Roosa, apparently who's sitting at the console with Ron Evans. We should have had Canary's acquisition at this time. We have data coming in. Here goes Roosa's call. At least he has his button punched for air-to ground. There he goes.
CANARY (REV 57)
089:40:38 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston through Canaries.
089:40:42 Schweickart (Spider): Go, Houston. This is Spider. Reading you loud and clear.
089:40:44 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop.
089:40:48 Roosa: Roger. I copy both you and Gumdrop. We want to update your Y-PIPA and, since we've got the REFSMMAT in there, we'll just have to punch it in manually. Do you want me to give you the address or do you want us to do it? [Pause]
089:41:03 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. I'm up in the tunnel; why don't you all do it? Okay?
089:41:09 Roosa: Say again, Gumdrop.
089:41:11 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. I said, I'm up in the tunnel. Why don't you all go ahead and do it?
089:41:15 Roosa: I think that's a sterling idea. We'll... [Long pause]
089:41:28 Scott (Gumdrop): You've got P00 in ACCEPT? [Pause]
089:41:36 Roosa: Roger. Thank you, Gumdrop. [Long pause]
089:42:39 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, Gumdrop.
089:42:40 Roosa: Go, Gumdrop.
089:42:42 Scott (Gumdrop): Spider's calling you.
089:42:45 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. Say again. I'm not reading you at all.
089:42:50 McDivitt (Spider): Do you read now?
089:42:51 Roosa: Roger. I'm reading you loud and clear now, Jim.
089:42:54 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. I'd like to report that the heater indicator on my OPS does not come on. I'm planning on using Rusty's if we have to make a contingency transfer. We just got an AGS caution and warning light on. I don't know how long it's been up there. I just got suited up and turned around here.
089:43:14 Roosa: Roger, Spider. I copy both those and we see the AGS warning light. We'll give you some words on it.
089:43:22 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Roger, Stu. The AGS light did not light off a MASTER ALARM except when I turn the AGS on. My guess is that the AGS light came on and stayed on when I activated the AGS, but there's no way I can be sure of that.
089:43:42 Roosa: Roger, Spider. Copy. [Pause]
089:43:51 McDivitt (Spider): For your information, Houston, we're doing the pressure integrity check. We're just starting the pressure integrity check right now.
089:43:59 Roosa: Roger, Spider. Copy. [Long pause]
MADRID (REV 57)
089:44:52 Roosa: Gumdrop, this is Houston. We're through with the uplink. Your Y-PIPA has been updated and the computer is yours.
089:45:00 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. Thank you.
Comm break.
089:47:28 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop. Bring up your S-band for Madrid. [Long pause]
089:48:03 Roosa: Gumdrop, this is Houston. Do you read? [Long pause]
089:48:40 Roosa: Spider, Houston. If you read, Rusty, check your suit isolation valve. We're showing it disconnected.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. Apparently we've had loss of signal at Madrid without any response from the crew over Madrid station. They may not have turned up their S-band volume. This particular station is one of several with the S-band capability and requires that the receiver for that particular mode of communication be turned up. Likewise at Honeysuckle Creek in Australia. The next station to acquire Apollo 9 will be the tracking ship Mercury at 35 minutes past the hour which will be approximately 45 minutes from now. About half a revolution without any contact with the spacecraft. At the present time the crew in the lunar module are conducting a pressure integrity checks of the pressure garments, or spacesuits. At 89 hours 50 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
090:23:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] tape. The time is now 90:23 - and we just finished pressurizing the ascent system, and following that, we cycle the ascent feed valves, that [garble] already been positioned on the system's day, and I noticed that when we cycled - recycled the ascent feeds l, and the ascent feeds 1, in both systems open, that [garble] valves went OPEN. I could feel them in my feet.
090:24:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Was that 9 - 90:24 - 90 -
090:24:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, let's see RCS cold Fire.
090:24:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's a swinging idea. Let me just make sure of that again now. (Coughing) I want these open. Okay. Okay, CSM MIN DEADBAND and ATTITUDE HOLD so ...
090:24:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, let's try to do without that.

090:24:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No.
090:24:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Those have been - We've been above 120 for an hour and 25 minutes right now. We ought to keep track of that.
090:24:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right. Okay, got that.

090:38:01 Roosa: Roger, Gumdrop. I copy.
090:38:04 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. [Long pause]
090:38:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): THROTTLE two. Okay, and VERB 74, and I'll give a 3, 2, 1, MARK.
090:38:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, GO.
090:38:20 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Here we come with the E memory dump, if you're ready, Houston.
090:38:24 Roosa: We're rocking on ready. Go ahead.
090:38:27 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. 3, 2, 1.
090:38:30 Scott (Gumdrop): MARK.
090:38:31 Scott (Gumdrop): E memory dump. [Long pause]
090:39:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we got the E-memory dump, and that was - Let me get - I got TELEMETRY, HIGH. Have we got INSTRUMENTATION B, CLOSED? Oh, balls, we don't.
090:39:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, I don't know we need it on yet.
090:39:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, it's supposed to be closed for the E-memory dump. Right there.
090:39:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Wonder why?
090:39:28 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, Spider.
090:39:30 Roosa: Go ahead, Spider.
090:39:32 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. I just noticed that we don't have R and D instrumentation B closed - or we did not have it closed for that E memory dump. Do you want to re-do that?
090:39:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Why don't you close it now, Jim?
090:39:43 Roosa: We'd like to have the E memory dump again. We had a drop out of telemetry, and stand by. [Pause]
090:39:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble].
090:39:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'm not sure that the ...
090:39:52 Roosa: Disregard the circuit breaker; let us have the E memory dump.
090:39:57 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. I understand. Negative on the R and D B, and another E memory dump. 3, 2 [garble].
090:40:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1
090:40:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
090:40:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And, if you would, please remind us to get that R&D B in at some later date.
090:40:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's in the flight plan right up here.
090:40:08 Roosa: Okay. Spider this is Houston. We're not going to get it here. We'll see you over Antigua at about 03, and Spider, give us low bit rate if you read. [Pause]
090:40:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger.
090:40:23 Schweickart (Spider): Low bit rate.
090:40:25 McDivitt (Spider): Yes. We should have DSI VHF B on over Antigua.
090:40:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, okay. Well, I'm not sure, Jim; it's in the checklist, but I'm not sure whether a - because of the E-memory -
090:40:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. I think it's just - that [garble].
090:40:31 Roosa: That's affirmative, Spider. And Gumdrop, this Houston. If you still read me, we didn't give you a NAV check up, but we pulled a vector compare; it's real good. We're going to disregard it. [Pause]
090:40:45 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop. Roger. Understand. [Pause]
090:40:52 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston. We'd recommend AC roll.
Very long comm break.
090:40:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, we're all through with all of our checks, except ...
090:40:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Gimbal drive.
090:40:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ...frantic pass.
090:40:59 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble] hours. Is that affirm?
This is Apollo Control. Apparently Apollo 9 went over the hill at the tracking ship Mercury without being able to acknowledge the last transmission from spacecraft communicator Stu Roosa. We will be coming up on the tracking station Antigua overlapping tracking ship Vanguard, Canary Island tracking station and Madrid with first acquisition at Antigua. At 2 minutes 40 seconds past the hour with continuous coverage across the before mentioned stations leaving Madrid at 23 minutes past the hour. We're approximately 21 minutes total pass over these 4 stations. At 90 hours 41 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control.
090:41:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Except the landing what?
090:41:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Except the frantic pass.
090:41:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh.
090:41:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Antigua, Canaries, and -
090:41:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, we ought to be in good shape for that, too.
090:41:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. We do a PIPA BIAS check here.
090:41:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. Okay, let's do that. Where is it?
090:41:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): A REG check, too.
090:41:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, we got to do that damned REG check. PIPA BIAS check. Why don't we do that while we're playing with the DSKY?
090:41:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, then we'll get the REG check right after that. Then I think -
090:41:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Gumdrop, Spider.
090:41:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, that's alright. Okay.
090:41:46 Scott (Spider onboard): Go.
090:41:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger. Are you in FREE?
090:41:48 Scott (Spider onboard): I'm there, yes.
090:41:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And are your rates less then 0.1?
090:41:51 Scott (Spider onboard): Let me - let me [garble].
090:41:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. [Garble] a few little tweaks.
090:42:03 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
090:42:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we'll advise when we've done our PIPA BIAS check for you.
090:42:09 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay.
090:42:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, VERB 25, NOUN 21, ENTER.
090:42:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] took a big step.
090:42:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, ENTER, ENTER, and give me a MARK when you hit the third one.
090:42:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Ready, 3, 2, 1 -
090:42:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
090:42:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, VERB 6, NOUN 21, ENTER.
090:42:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, hit it again at 32.
090:43:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, stand by. Okay, Gumdrop, you're clear to do anything you want. We're done with the BIAS check.
090:43:14 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
090:43:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, that's different from the other day, isn't it?
090:43:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It is.
090:43:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Plus 05, plus 01, and plus 01.
090:43:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's a nine.
090:43:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, it's a nine. Thank you. Okay, do a VERB 06, NOUN 1, and let's look at it. 1452. It was 12 before ...
090:43:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] 3.
090:43:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, so we can alter that one, and that - that was a minus 3; that's now a plus 1. Okay, and let's do an ENTER; 1456, ENTER and check the other one.
090:44:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. [Garble].
090:44:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That was a plus 1, and it's still a plus 1. Good old Z [garble]. Okay, so we want to change X and Y. Okay, VERB 21, NOUN 1, ENTER. 1452, ENTER.
090:44:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Plus ...
090:44:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 09, ENTER.
090:44:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 09000, ENTER. ENTER 1454, ENTER. Plus 01000, ENTER. Okay, you want to check the VERB 06, NOUN 1; 1452. Let's see, what was that? That was - that was a plus 12 and a minus 3, wasn't it? And a plus 1?
090:45:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
090:45:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, got in there. 9045 [garble].
090:45:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble].
090:45:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, want to do the REG check now?
090:45:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, we might as well. That's the only other thing that looks like it's going to fit up there. Boy, I hate to do that damn thing.
090:45:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, and an AGS CAL we can do too. Well, we might as well wait until they give us the torquing angle.
090:45:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, yes. Let's do the regulator check.
090:45:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh hey, I can do the AGS initialization. Let me go ahead and get that thing going.
090:45:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's - no - let's get the REG check out of the way. We've got just about enough time to fit it in here.
090:46:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
090:46:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'd like to see it gone.
090:46:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going to be off - hell, I don't know if I want to be off the loop. Oh, we don't pressurize on this one. Okay, I'm going to be on the loop.
090:46:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Gumdrop, Spider.
090:46:28 Scott (Spider onboard): Spider.
090:46:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Roger, we're going to come up with our infamous bang again here in a few minutes.
090:46:33 Scott (Spider onboard): I'm holding my breath.
090:46:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You made a few yourself today.
090:46:38 Scott (Spider onboard): Say again?
090:46:39 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I say, you made a few bangs yourself today.
090:46:41 Scott (Spider onboard): Oh, really. When?
090:46:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You were making those docking latches.
090:46:46 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble] I was checking a couple of them out there. They - one of them was a little sticky, but it works fine.
090:46:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, going off the air here, and you'll hear a bang in probably about 5 minutes. Okay.
090:46:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Gumdrop, is the tunnel depressed yet?
090:47:01 Scott (Spider onboard): Roller, tunnel's depressed, and I have a good hatch [garble] check, and the [garble] and everything looks good.
090:47:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, very good.
090:47:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Tunnel hatch is closed, depress - CABIN GAS RETURN to EGRESS.
090:47:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): EGRESS, Crazy!
090:47:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): CABIN REPRESS to AUTO.
090:47:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CABIN REPRESS is in AUTO.
090:47:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, PRESS REG B to EGRESS.
090:47:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): PRESS REG B to - going to EGRESS. Okay.
090:47:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, FORWARD CABIN DUMP valve, OPEN, and then AUTO at 4 ...
090:47:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You know that's a bad way to do that. Yes.
090:47:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Why?
090:47:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, it could shut off all the flow in the suit.
090:47:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, it's not so bad.
090:47:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Ha!
090:47:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let me open up the -
090:47:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, now I want to go REG A to CLOSE when the CABIN REPRESS starts.
090:47:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble].
090:47:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, go ahead. You watching it today too, huh? Yes, okay.
090:48:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Here it goes. Okay, we got the MASTER ALARM; I'll get that. Okay.
090:48:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. As soon as CABIN REPRESS starts, PRESS REG A, CLOSE; CABIN WARNING LIGHT, OFF; CABIN REPRESS stops; it does.
090:48:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Alright.
090:48:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): CABIN REPRESS, CLOSE.
090:48:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): REPRESS going to CLOSE, here we go. Bang.
090:48:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, FORWD CABIN DUMP valve OPEN; and then AUTO at 3.5.
090:48:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
090:48:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You're going to have to read this one to me.
090:48:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You want me to read this one to you?
090:48:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, tell me when we get to 3.5.
090:48:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, okay, yes.
090:48:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay 3.6, 3.5 now.
090:48:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
090:48:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. The suit's at 4.2.
090:48:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Alrighty. And ...
090:48:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Get that big noise bank pushed out. (Laughter) Okay.
090:48:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's a piece of our ECF.
090:48:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): What is it?
090:48:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I don't know.
090:49:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): If it's nonconductive, let's put it up through the ceiling.
090:49:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, shoot.
090:49:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, go ahead.
090:49:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] little bag.
090:49:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, OPEN then AUTO at 3.5. PRESS RED B, CLOSED. Oh, wait a minute. Okay, let me open it up and bring the suits down. Here we go. Okay, we're all the way down. REG B to CLOSE.
090:49:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
090:49:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Here goes the MASTER ALARM. Okay, you want to get that? I'll get it, yes.
090:49:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] get that.
090:49:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Well, let's see, SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF, OPEN, then AUTO at 3.5; you've already done that. PRESS REG B to EGRESS. B to EGRESS, hell, we already did that. Okay, we're going back up.
090:49:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, now PRESS REG B to CLOSE.
090:49:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Going back to CLOSE.
090:49:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): SUIT CIRCUIT RELIER to OPEN.
090:49:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, coming down.
090:50:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] suit pressure's 3.5.
090:50:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
090:50:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): PRESS REG B to EGRESS.
090:50:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): A, we just did B, Jim.
090:50:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I said A, didn't I?
090:50:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, you said B. Okay, A comes [garble].
090:50:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): PRESS REG A to EGRESS.
090:50:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, pressure's coming up.
090:50:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's a slow one.
090:50:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, it is, isn't it? Okay.
090:50:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] CABIN REPRESS to AUTO.
090:50:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, here we go. Okay.
090:50:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, PRESS REG B to CABIN.
090:50:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Here's where we come up.
090:50:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): PRESS REG A, CABIN.
090:50:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): REG A, CABIN.
090:50:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): CABIN GAS RETURN to AUTO.
090:50:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CABIN GAS RETURN to AUTO.
090:51:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): SUIT GAS DIVERTER, push to CABIN.
090:51:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): SUIT GAS DIVERT, push to CABIN.
090:51:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, and that's it.
090:51:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Let me just check everything.
090:51:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, it all looks good.
090:51:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
090:51:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Crazy. Okay, now I'll set my AGS start. How you like that, Davie?
090:51:22 Scott (Spider onboard): Swell!
090:51:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, our CABIN PRESSURE is - Ohhh, that's okay, good. That too [garble]. Hey, my glove's coming off again.
090:51:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We seem to have lost our Velcro off of there completely.
090:51:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh yes. It's probably on the back of my camera. I put my camera on there. Hey, look at those pretty pink [garble].
090:51:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
090:51:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, the regulator check we did at 90:46 and 90:52.
090:52:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I guess the first thing we want is the E-memory dump thing, huh?
090:52:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Well, we've already done that though, we may not need that.
090:52:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, they didn't - I don't think they got it last time - again.
090:52:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What makes you think that?
090:52:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I think that they said that they didn't.
090:52:39 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's why we gave them the second one.
090:52:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I know it, but they said they were losing us.
090:53:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That clock's a little bit fast.
090:53:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Not much, but -
090:54:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): What are we - one REV ahead?
090:54:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Not quite, we're about [garble]. The AGS initialization would be in about an hour from now. No, it I wouldn't either. It'll be in about 30 minutes from now. We're running about 30 minutes ahead.
090:54:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] look like? Great!
090:54:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, so what do we want to do here, now?
090:55:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, we want -
090:55:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We want to see if they need an E-memory dump, I guess.
090:55:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, E-memory dump and then I want - to get the DPS GIMBAL DRIVE and final check all set up. We're back there.
090:55:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And we've also got to get the up - update.
090:55:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, that's the big thing.
090:55:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
090:55:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You got to read the IMU gi - gimbal angles down at MCC?
090:55:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We've already read them.
090:55:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I guess we got those down over the -
090:55:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
090:55:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): - after the alignment after all. Okay. CD update. That's gimbal drive and throttle check. I guess we'd better get that.
090:55:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, okay. You want a setup for that?
090:55:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
090:55:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, THROTTLE CONTROL to MANUAL.
090:55:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Just a second. Let me find it here.
090:55:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What page is it on?
090:55:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Rendezvous 24.
090:56:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Rendezvous 24. Then you want the THROTTLE CONTROL to MANUAL. Go ahead.
090:56:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, stand by, MANUAL THROTTLE to SYSTEM ENGINRER.
090:56:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
090:56:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): TTCA, both, throttle up, MINIMTUM. Okay, that's as far as we can go. Now, I guess we can do the VERB 48, and we can be sitting right there ready to - well, but we don't know if they want to do the E-memory dump first.
090:56:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Let's just leave it right here.
090:56:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, then we just go back into P00 here.
090:57:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, is that OPS [garble] on pretty good today?
090:57:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I've got it on the same way I had it on yesterday with that piece of Beta-cloth netting hooked around the handle, so I hope it doesn't come out.
090:57:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, well, we don't ever - Oh! The ascent engine burn light. [Garble].
090:57:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): For as little sleep as we got, I feel pretty damned good.
090:57:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, me too. I'm getting hungry. Getting hungry!
090:58:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I've only been up 4 hours.
090:58:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Have we?
090:58:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
090:58:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Is that all? Not bad. Let's see. Where are we here.
090:58:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] 86:40 we got up.
090:59:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Rendezvous radar. We ought to get that damned thing undone.
090:59:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, that comes - [garble] as we leave there, we can take and - [garble] thing is really printed neatly.
090:59:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, we want to get R&D B in now, Jim? Past that [garble].
090:59:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, when we come up on -
090:59:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Are we passed that time?
090:59:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, we have about another 5 minutes to go.
090:59:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, okay. You want to unstow that radar and slew it around?
090:59:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, why don't we do it after we finish this pass? We got all this time here -
090:59:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Fine.
091:00:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Run a self-check on -
091:00:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I figured we could play with it for awhile.
091:00:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Run a [garble] check on stuff; and then when we come down here, we'll run another one.
091:00:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. How are you doing, Gumdrop?
091:00:15 Scott (Spider onboard): Fine [garble].
091:00:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. We're well up on the timeline here. This is our wild pass coming up; and after this, we need to do our AGS CAL, we've got to disable the B-3 thruster and do our rendezvous radar check and all that stuff.
091:00:31 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay. I'm - right up with you by about 3 minutes.
091:00:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Three minutes? What's he talking about there?
091:00:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, he's probably following in the flight plan. He's probably one step behind us.
091:00:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh.
091:01:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Here, let me see if we bypassed anything now.
091:01:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we've got everything up to this time.
091:01:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, that was my conclusion, too.
This is Apollo Control 91 hours 02 minutes GET. Some 40 seconds away from acquisition at the Antigua tracking station. For the beginning of about a 20 minute pass, Antigua, tracking ship Vanguard, Canary Islands, and Madrid. We'll stand by here until the spacecraft communicator Stu Roosa makes the initial call. There likely will be a great deal of exchange during this 20 minute pass and getting all of the details sorted out. Information exchange between ground and the crew in preparation for the undocking, and the subsequent rendezvous sequence. We've had an indication of acquisition of signal at Antigua. There goes.
091:02:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you want to rehydrate some food?
091:02:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, we're just about at that pass. Why don't we go through the pass. When we finish it, at least get a drink. [Garble] finish out that AGS initialization, AGS CAL - Well, we've got the AGS initialization, haven't we?
091:02:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, no, ...
091:02:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble]. No, we've got to update the state vector yet.
091:02:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... we had an update -
091:02:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Take my helmet and gloves off and get a drink, anyway.
091:02:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I'll tell you what. Hey, I'm going to put my window heater on.
091:02:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, why, you getting steamy?
091:02:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, I can see a little bit, of fog in there and I don't, know whether it's -
091:03:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Gummy must be thrusting.
091:03:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
091:03:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hate to see him thrust around very much just on the capture latches.
091:03:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): (Laughter) He's supposed to hold it.
091:03:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. I know.
ANTIGUA (REV 58)
091:03:38 Roosa: Hello. Spider/Gumdrop, Houston through Antiqua. Do you read?
091:03:45 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop, five-square.
091:03:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, shoot.
091:03:48 Roosa: Roger, Gumdrop. Do I have Spider with me? And as soon as we get data here, we're going to have that E memory dump again. Spider.
091:03:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, shoot.
091:03:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): They're - they're coming now.
091:03:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I don't hear them. Do you hear them?
091:03:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, just a minute, let me switch antennas. Here they are.
091:03:58 Scott (Gumdrop): Spider, Gumdrop. Houston's on the line, and they say as soon as they get data they're going to do the E memory dump again.
091:04:04 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. We're ready.
091:04:07 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay, Spider. Do you read Houston?
091:04:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Sure do.
091:04:10 Schweickart (Spider): Roger, Houston. Read you now.
091:04:12 Roosa: Okay. While we're waiting on that E memory dump let me give you torqueing angles.
091:04:17 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Ready to copy.
091:04:19 Roosa: Roger. Torqueing angles: minus 00370, minus 00790, minus 00310. [Pause]
091:04:34 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Readback: minus 00370, minus 00790, minus 00310.
091:04:45 Roosa: Roger. Copy. And we'd like to have high bit rate.
091:04:50 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. High bit rate. [Pause]
091:05:04 McDivitt (Spider): Houston, did you ever find out anything about that AGS warning light yet?
091:05:08 Roosa: Roger. We're working on that, and we'll probably have a procedure for you that might solve the problem - probably to turn it off and back on again, but we'll pass you the details later. [Pause]
091:05:22 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. [Long pause]
091:05:35 McDivitt: [Garble] VERB 42.
ANTIGUA (REV 58)
091:05:41 McDivitt (Spider): Okay.
091:05:44 Scott (Gumdrop): VERB 42. [Long pause]
091:06:18 McDivitt (Spider): Houston, say again. [Pause]
091:06:23 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. We are getting CSM data; we are getting no data from you. You might check the switches, please
091:06:34 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. Everything's checked out. We're in telemetry HIGH.
091:06:40 McDivitt (Spider): And Houston, RD Instrumentation B circuit breaker coming in now.
091:06:43 Roosa: Okay. Thank you. [Pause]
091:06:52 Roosa: Okay. We've got our data. Spider, we're ready for E memory dump on our Mark.
091:06:57 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. 3, 2, 1.
091:07:00 McDivitt (Spider): MARK. [Pause]
091:07:06 McDivitt (Spider): And, Houston, be advised that once again our supercritical [garble].
091:07:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Pressure doesn't seem to be working for the descent stage.
091:07:14 Roosa: I'm sorry, Jim; I couldn't read that. Say again.
091:07:18 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. Supercritical pressure gage does not seem to be working for the descent propulsion system.
091:07:26 Roosa: Roger. Copy. [Pause]
091:07:34 Roosa: And, Spider, we're reading 704 on the SUPERCRIT.
091:07:39 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. [Long pause]
091:07:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Probably low.
091:07:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Wail, we're blowing down anyway.
091:07:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I know it, but that's still awfully low.
091:07:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
091:07:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's going down ...
091:07:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I'll bet that's a big surprise to them all.
091:07:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
091:07:54 Roosa: Okay. Spider, Houston. The dump is complete. We're ready to uplink your state vector REFSMMAT.
091:08:01 Schweickart (Spider): Roger.
091:08:04 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Go ahead.
091:08:06 Roosa: Okay. It's on its way. [Long pause]
091:08:47 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, Spider. We're ready to copy the NAV check if you've got that.
091:08:50 Roosa: Roger.
091:08:54 Roosa: Reading the NAV check: 092 0000, minus 2799, plus 14631 1245. [Pause]
091:09:30 Roosa: Spider, Houston. Did you copy the NAV check? [Pause]
091:09:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Broke S-band lock. Houston, you reading Spider?
091:09:41 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. Try me again.
091:09:47 Schweickart (Spider): Okay, Houston. Spider's back on with you now. I got the time and that's all.
091:09:53 Roosa: Roger. Reading: you have the time, minus 2799, plus 14631 1245. [Long pause]
091:10:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you broke out again. I got the altitude that time. I got minus 027. Say again and all after.
091:10:23 Roosa: Gumdrop, do you read Houston? [Pause]
091:10:32 Scott (Gumdrop): Spider, Gumdrop. Houston's breaking up on me, too.
091:10:34 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
091:10:37 Roosa: Okay, Spider. I've got you now. Try your readback.
091:10:41 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. I didn't get it; you're breaking up pretty badly, Houston. I get minus 027 and you broke up so say again all after, please. [Pause]
091:10:53 Roosa: Okay. Starting with the time: 092 0000, minus 2799, plus 14631 1245. [Pause]
091:11:15 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. 92 0000, minus 2799, plus 14631 1245.
091:11:26 Roosa: That's affirmative. Spider. Houston confirms the update. [Long pause]
091:11:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Terrible.
091:11:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. We're going to have us a problem; I can see that.
091:11:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. The S-band seems to be on.
091:11:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Did you notice what the first - whether that was a REFSMMAT or a state vector?
091:11:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No.
091:12:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That was a state vector.
091:12:24 Roosa: Okay. Spider/Gumdrop, I've probably got you solid now. How do you read me?
091:12:30 Schweickart (Spider): Better now, Houston. You're better. [Pause]
091:12:34 Scott (Gumdrop): Almost five-by.
091:12:35 Roosa: Very good. [Long pause]
091:12:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Come on, baby, get in there. I'd better get an update form ready.
091:12:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
091:13:09 Roosa: Okay. Spider, this is Houston. We've got the state vector in, we have VERB 66ed it, and we're going to hand over here within a few seconds, and then we'll put in the REFSMMAT.
091:13:21 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Roger. [Long pause]
091:13:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, there it goes. 24; come on, baby. There we go, 7035. Beautiful. Okay, and it's got to work its way up to 331.
091:14:04 Scott (Gumdrop): Spider, Gumdrop. I have a good transfer now.
091:14:08 Schweickart (Spider): Very good. In just a couple minutes we're going to find out if we have a good radar. [Long pause]
091:14:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. We're ready to go the gimbal drive and throttle test. VERB 33, ENTER.
091:14:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Do you have that pad out so that we can verify the stuff in here, when we go through it?
091:14:54 Schweickart (Spider): Okay, Houston. Let us know when you're ready for the gimbal drive and throttle.
091:15:00 Roosa: Okay, Spider. The computer is yours. We are ready for your gimbal drive and throttle checks. Press ahead.
091:15:06 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. It works. [Long pause]
091:15:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): In work. Okay, VERB 48, ENTER. DAP configuration, there; 22145, that's good; 2709, that's good; PRO; ENGINE GIMBAL TRIM, plus 428, plus 730. Okay, MODE CONTROL to AUTO.

091:15:40 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Houston, I'm going to start the drive now.
091:15:43 Roosa: Roger. Go ahead, Spider; we're ready.
091:15:47 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. It's going.
091:15:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we'll monitor it there.
091:15:54 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Are you ready for the throttle check?
091:15:57 Roosa: That's affirmative. Spider. Go ahead.
091:15:59 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. LMP throttle is MINIMUM, coming up to the soft stop; soft stop is 53 percent; STP is OFF SCALE HIGH, DEARCPA light back down to the soft stop to idle.
091:16:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, MANUAL THROTTLE, COMMANDER.
091:16:22 Roosa: Roger, Spider. We copied. Go ahead.
091:16:25 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Here comes the commander's throttle.
091:16:28 Roosa: Okay. Press ahead, Jim; the LMP's throttle looked good.
091:16:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Minimum ...
091:16:33 Schweickart (Spider): We're up to soft stop, full throttle, back down to detent. [Pause]
091:16:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO.
091:16:48 Roosa: Roger. It looked good. Let's press, and this time both vehicles can bring up their S-band.
091:16:54 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. [Long pause]
091:16:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, stand by. We're about to get the thing finished driving. Okay, and the next step is ENGINE ARM to OFF. There goes one of them. Okay, there goes the other one. Key release. ENGINE ARM to OFF.
091:17:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ENGINE ARM, OFF.
091:17:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): TTCA JETS, both DOWN.
091:17:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.

091:17:42 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. You're GO on your gimbals and the throttle checks. We're standing by for the hot fire.
091:17:49 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. In work. Okay, Gumdrop. We're going to be doing our hot fire check here.
091:17:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Damn it; CB(11) here, too.
091:17:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger. Did you get it.
091:17:57 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Going to three.
091:17:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No. Was that yours or mine.
091:17:59 Schweickart (Spider): Here comes the first [garble]. [Long pause]
091:18:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CB(11), DEKA POWER, OPEN.
091:18:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I thought that was CB(11), STAB CONTROL, DESCENT ENGINE OVERRIDE.
091:18:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's - Okay, I'm sorry; that's a 16. I got it.
091:18:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Go on. Okay. HIGH bit rate with MSC - Let's see.
091:18:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. We got that. I just told him the quad temps are up.

MADRID (REV 58)
091:19:44 Roosa: Okay, Gumdrop. If - Can you read me?
091:19:49 Schweickart (Spider): Here we go with the other hot mode.
091:19:51 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger.
091:19:52 Roosa: Okay. Spider's very weak. His data is good, however. Let - And I'd like to remind you that B-3 is still ENABLED.
091:20:01 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger.
091:20:04 Scott (Gumdrop): Spider, Gumdrop. They say you're still good.
091:20:08 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. We read them, and we're going to start the PGNCS checks here in just a minute. We just did the AGS translation control check.
091:20:16 Roosa: Roger. Now you're loud and clear, Spider. We're working through Madrid now.
091:20:22 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Here comes the PGNCS and TTCA's.
091:20:26 Roosa: Okay. [Long pause]
091:20:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Who's translating it?
091:20:40 Schweickart (Spider): It's complete.
091:20:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, 2 JETS.
091:20:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, somebody's keying continuously. Okay. Okay, 2 JETS; DEADBAND, MIN, set the DAP to 01002. Okay, that was at 91:01:18, 91:21.
091:20:46 Roosa: Roger, Spider. [Long pause]
091:21:16 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, how do you read Spider?
091:21:18 Roosa: You're loud and clear, Spider.
091:21:19 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
091:21:20 Schweickart (Spider): What's the trouble with COMM here?
091:21:22 Roosa: I don't know. You got real weak on me, but good data across on you there. [Pause]
091:21:30 Roosa: And then it came in good when we handed off to Madrid. [Pause]
091:21:43 Roosa: Okay. And we're probably going to lose Madrid shortly, and we'll see you over Carnarvon at 51. The first look at your checks look real good, Spider.
091:21:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Houston, this is Spider. You're unreadable.
091:21:52 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay, Houston. Say again the time.
091:21:55 Roosa: Roger. We'll see you at Carnarvon about 51.
091:21:57 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Carnarvon 51, and Spider, he said your tests look real good.
091:22:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, UP.
091:22:02 Roosa: And Spider, give me low bit rate
091:22:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger.
091:22:04 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Low bit rate.
091:22:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Got that one.
091:22:09 Roosa: And we just about used it up that time, troops.
091:22:11 Schweickart (Spider): Yes, I sure would appreciate it if we had better COMM.
091:22:16 Roosa: So would I. [Pause]
091:22:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, that - the NAV check is a GO.
091:22:24 Roosa: Gumdrop, this is Houston. Did you get a C and W right at the end there?
091:22:29 Scott (Gumdrop): Negative.
091:22:30 Roosa: Okay. Thank you.
091:22:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): RESET that damn heater light again.
091:22:32 Scott (Gumdrop): Should I have?
091:22:35 Roosa: No. No; the H2 heater cycle D and we are curious whether you got it or not.
091:22:42 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay.
Very long comm break.
091:22:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): IMU fine align; we've done that.
091:22:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, I think we've got everything done up to the ACS CAL.
091:22:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. AGS initialization, too.
091:22:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. Let's do that, and I'll get into HIGH bit rate again. I don't think we're supposed to go back to LOW - Oh, that's alright. I'll go to HIGH bit rate now, and we'll do that. Yes.
091:23:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, Gumdrop, this is Spider. You can start getting us into our AGS CAL attitude now.
091:23:08 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, Roger.
091:23:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): AGS calibration.
091:23:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'm getting that.
091:23:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] regulator checks; landing radar self-test.
091:23:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I want to bring the rendezvous radar on the line here. Hey, Gumdrop, would you disable your P-3 thruster? We're going to unlimber the radar here.
This is Apollo Control. We're within a few seconds of LOS time here on the displays at the Madrid stations. The next station to acquire Apollo 9 will be Carnarvon, Australia. Tracking station for the first pass of the morning. At 50 minutes 14 seconds past the hour for slightly over 5 minutes tracking time, there will be no doubt additional conversation there, as the crew continues to go through the various systems checks in preparation for the undocking, and rendezvous sequence of the day. At 91 hours 24 minutes GET, this is Apollo Control.
091:23:59 McDivitt (onboard): Hey, Gumdrop, would you disable your B-3 thruster? We're going to unlimber the radar here.
091:24:02 Scott (onboard): Roger. It is disabled.
091:24:03 McDivitt (onboard): Roger; thank you.
091:24:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, veri -
091:24:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You know something? That ...
091:24:07 Schweickart (onboard): COMP ACTIVITY light...
091:24:09 McDivitt (onboard): Check your transponder. It'll be off, too, please.
091:24:11 Scott (onboard): Roger. Transponder is off.
091:24:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... that COMP activity light stays on a long while; I'm wondering if they gave us a state vector that's more than one REV ahead.
091:24:16 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
091:24:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): They can do it more than - more than one REV ahead, just can't give it more than one REV behind.
091:24:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): But this integrates it one REV back. That's the point.
091:24:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh.
091:24:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I'm going to ask them about that, next station.
091:24:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. You want to do the radar now?
091:24:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, let's do the radar now.
091:24:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, the update went across when we checked the orbit. 127.1 by - Hey, Jim. It didn't flash, did it?
091:24:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No. I guess it hasn't.
091:24:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): How about hitting the key release? Why don't you wait until it - 127.1 by 119.7. Wow! Okay, there it goes. Okay.
091:25:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, RENDEZVOUS RADAR coming to RELEASE.
091:25:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, hey, how about - Wait a minute. Before you do that, let's look through the - Let me look through here when you do it, or do you want to look through it when you do it?
091:25:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Go ahead and look through.
091:25:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Alright, let me get it in FORWARD. Okay, FORWARD.
091:25:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Go.
091:25:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Son of a gun never blinked. Okay, now you want to - Let's see, what's next. Wait, here I am. CROSS POINTERS, both HIGH MULTIPLIER. If that isn't the most sterling update to the AGS I've ever seen.
091:26:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Okay, let's see. HIGH MULT. Okay, I'm in HIGH MULT.

091:33:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Shit.
091:33:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You can tell me whether it goes too far or not far enough.
091:33:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Go.
091:33:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay?
091:33:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Go.
091:33:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's fine.
091:33:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's fine?
091:33:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
091:33:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
091:33:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh boy, is there a crop on that telescope! Whooee!
091:33:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Really?
091:33:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
091:33:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Let me see it. Oh, and the EVA - Oh, well it's not going to be there. There's a black spot.
091:33:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's great.

091:34:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Leave it OPEN.
091:34:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Doggone it. I wanted to see if it stayed there when we did that.
091:34:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Ah! Okay, let's press on with the card here.
091:34:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] rendezvous radar check ...
091:34:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Want to check the AGS? I've got the AGS calibration ready to go.
091:34:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] trans [garble].
091:34:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, shoot, you're breaking up now.
091:35:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, I turned it down a little bit. Gumdrop, how do you read?
091:35:06 Scott (Spider onboard): 5 by.
091:35:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Did you get - We're done with our rendezvous radar checks, and you can activate your transponder [garble].
091:35:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, wait a second, Gumdrop. Leave it off for a while. We may have to run this again. They want this run over a station. I wanted to run it to see how it worked.
091:35:18 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay. I'll leave it off.
091:35:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, let's remember that.
091:35:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
091:35:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's run the AGS initialization, AGS CAL.
091:35:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
091:35:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We're going to start running that AGS CAL here in just a minute, Dave.
091:35:30 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay.
091:35:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You want to verify those?
091:35:39 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, we're pretty close to - in one of our gimbal angles. Yes.
091:35:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Both of them.
091:35:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Both of them.
091:35:49 Scott (Spider onboard): Are you really?
091:35:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. We're at 275 on one.
091:35:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, all of them are that way.
091:35:53 Scott (Spider onboard): Heck, I'm not even that close.
091:35:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Uh oh. Yes, one of them is 17 degrees off; that's not bad. The other's 13 degrees off, and the other's 5.
091:36:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, Gumdrop, this is because of that 90 degree rotation again, I think.
091:36:11 Scott (Spider onboard): Yes. You see, I'm sitting on - sort of a 22 degree - degree offset from 000 inertially.
091:36:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We're - we're not in good shape over here.
091:36:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, we've got to make one of them change. It's going the wrong way right now.
091:36:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, that one's okay. Let's see, that's - outer - which is - Where do we want to be? That one's okay, isn't it?
091:36:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, that's the one that's wrong. That's the 90-degree mark right now.
091:36:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, yes, okay. Let's see that's R, roll, so that's going to be closest to his ...
091:36:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): His yaw.
091:36:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... yaw, okay.
091:36:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Check your yaw.
091:37:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Dave, are you yawing at all?
091:37:03 Scott (Spider onboard): Yes, Roger, I'm trying to go the way you are saying.
091:37:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, fine. Okay, we've got that number increasing now so -
091:37:09 Scott (Spider onboard): That's the best way to go, huh?
091:37:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
091:37:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Check. They're all going the right way, and we'll let you know when we get there.
091:37:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Lighting check.
091:37:27 Scott (Spider onboard): How about doing a landing radar self-check while we're waiting.
091:37:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
091:37:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Can't do that though. We got to do the lighting check at night.
091:37:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. We also have to do the landing radar self test over a ground station.
091:37:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, okay.
091:37:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You want to get me a drink of water, maybe, and a -
091:37:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Let me see how the rendezvous radar - Okay, it came up to 40.
091:38:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Tell you what, I'm going to do another AGS update I here, while we're waiting.
091:38:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
091:38:26 Scott (Spider onboard): How you doing?
091:38:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We're - we're 5 degrees; we got to go another - about another 10 degrees at least in - in your yaw.
091:38:40 Scott (Spider onboard): Roger.
091:39:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): How are the optics looking, Dave?
091:39:11 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
091:40:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, it's 124 by 128 now, so that's a lot better.
091:40:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
091:40:13 Scott (Spider onboard): Are they in the ball park?
091:40:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] standby.
091:40:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, we have about 3 - we really have at least 3 more degrees in the direction that you're going.
091:40:30 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay.
091:40:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): How are those doing? Okay that's 19 and 20 -
091:40:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): They're doing great.
091:40:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, yes.
091:40:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, we're right back on the time line again. No matter now - how you hop to get ahead, you just can't get ahead.
091:41:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): How's everything running over there, Dave?
091:41:28 Scott (Spider onboard): Everything's running just fine. Nothing at all seems off nominal. I don't know where they get their caution and warning idea, but everything seems inside the limit. Well within sight.
091:41:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, what he said was that one - that hydrogen fan came on, and they thought may be you might have gone down below the limit, like it had been.
091:41:43 Scott (Spider onboard): No, it stayed right in the middle. Right there.
091:41:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Boy, that COMM is terrible.
091:41:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Sure is.
091:41:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, Dave, can you kill everything but your yaw rate and leave just a little bit in the same direction you are going in now.
091:42:08 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay.
091:42:30 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble] I got 0.05 in yaw directional [garble].
091:42:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, good.
091:42:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Balls, I'm sitting here sleeping.
091:43:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we're going to do a VERB 40, NOUN 20.
091:43:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'm checking out the ORDEAL, in case you see my ball wiggling around.
091:43:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Okay, Dave, you want to disable all your thrusters?
091:43:50 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, going FREE.
091:43:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, and we're starting the CAL now.
091:43:57 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay.
091:45:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Bias has stayed exactly the same.
091:45:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): The other one did?
091:45:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, all of them ...
091:45:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, good.
091:45:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... stayed exactly the same.
091:45:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Good.
091:45:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] do that landing radar self-test?
091:45:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's what I was thinking. Why don't we gin that up ...
091:45:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Here we go.
091:45:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): This one's ...
091:45:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CROSS-POINTERS both to HIGH MULT.
091:45:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ... 45. Let's - let's see what we have to do, there.
091:45:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, there - We've done that before in the middle of the CAL.
091:45:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. No, I - I was just wondering if they want it over the ground. I think this - Let's just press on with it, and to hell with the ground. CROSS-POINTERS both to HIGH MULT.
091:45:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, HIGH MULT.

091:46:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. CROSS POINTERS will oscillate, then up and right off scale. Man, I guess we got to wait for that to happen. I think I got to go to LANDING, the RADAR TEST to LANDING. Okay, there they go.
091:46:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay RADAR TEST to LANDING.
091:46:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right. Okay, and you can read me the things here.

091:49:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, let's see if our time's up; it should be up right now.
This is Apollo Control. Let's join the conversation in progress over Carnarvon.
CARNARVON (REV 58)
091:49:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Up.
091:49:21 Schweickart (Spider): [Garble] time [garble] breakdown.
091:49:24 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. [Pause]
091:49:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): This where we go?
091:49:31 Schweickart (Spider): CAL is complete there, chiefs.
091:49:36 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
091:49:37 McDivitt (Spider): Okay
091:49:38 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
091:49:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Say again.
091:49:40 Scott (Spider onboard): I say.
091:49:41 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. You're on the air all the time.
091:49:44 Schweickart (Spider): Yes; I notice that now. Thank you.
091:49:45 Schweickart (Spider): I think I use my VOX, and I forget to switch once and a while, so if it sounds like we're chatting here, let us know during the rendezvous.
091:49:52 Scott (Gumdrop): Alrighty.
091:49:55 Schweickart (Spider): We're close enough now; we don't need a mike.
091:50:00 Roosa: Gumdrop/Spider, this is Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
091:50:06 McDivitt (Spider): Roger, Houston. This is Spider, here. We just finished our landing radar test. We got the rendezvous radar test one time and it looks pretty good. We could do it again for you if you like. We're getting the AGS CAL data for you right now.
091:50:18 Roosa: Roger. Understand. And we'd like to have high bit rate, and leave it on from now on.
091:50:24 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. High bit rate from now on. [Pause]
091:50:29 Schweickart (Spider): How about that R and D B. You want that on from now on?
091:50:33 Roosa: That's affirmative, Spider.
091:50:36 McDivitt (Spider): Okay?
091:50:38 Schweickart (Spider): Okay, Houston. If you don't have any higher priority here, I got the AGS CAL data.
091:50:44 Roosa: That's number 1 on our list, Spider. Go.
091:50:47 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Before the CAL, the bias were, respectively, 00 and minus all 7's.
091:50:58 Roosa: All right. Copy.
091:51:00 Schweickart (Spider): The drift coefficient for plus 407, plus 30, is 28 and pull all zeros.
091:51:11 Roosa: Okay. Copy.
091:51:13 Schweickart (Spider): The CAL: The bias coefficients were plus 0, plus 0's, plus 0's, minus all 7's.
091:51:21 Roosa: Copy.
091:51:24 Schweickart (Spider): The coefficient for plus 0019, plus 0013, and 00001. [Pause]
091:51:37 Roosa: Roger. I copy those, Spider. Thank you very much. Pause]
091:51:42 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. And I we got a question for you.
091:51:44 Roosa: Go ahead.
091:51:45 Schweickart (Spider): Here we notice in updating the AGS that the computer activity light was on for a very long while. I wonder if maybe you updated our state vector more than a rev ahead, and then by doing a VERB 47 we intergrated it backward too far. I wonder if you could have someone look at that. [Pause]
091:52:09 Schweickart (Spider): Did you get that one?
091:52:10 Roosa: We copy, Spider. Stand by.
091:52:13 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. It's just a question of whether VERB 47 hurts us, when we do that.
091:52:18 Roosa: Roger. We can verify our state vector was not - was not more than a rev ahead, and we'll - We copied your question on the VERB 47.
091:52:28 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. As long as it was not more than a rev ahead when you updated us, there should be no sweat.
091:52:34 Roosa: Roger. Copy.
091:52:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, did they want ...
091:52:38 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, Gumdrop.
091:52:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... did they want to do a radar test?
091:52:40 Roosa: Go, Gumdrop.
091:52:42 Scott (Gumdrop): My fuel cell 2 condenser exhaust temperature is a tad high. What's it look like to you?
091:52:47 Roosa: Roger, Gumdrop. We've been checking that. It is running a little high. We think it's going to hold okay through the rendezvous.
091:52:56 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay; fine. It hasn't changed such during the last 30 minutes. I just thought I'd make sure of it.
091:53:01 Roosa: Roger. It's been cycling with the night/day cycle. We even think it's slave to the radiator.
091:53:09 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay.
091:53:11 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, this is Spider. Do you want either the landing radar or the rendezvous radar self-test performed again over the site?
091:53:18 Roosa: That's a negative. Spider.
091:53:21 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Great.
091:53:22 McDivitt (Spider): Gumdrop, you're clear to turn your transponder on then.
091:53:25 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. And I also expect DUPLEX A, and we'll see [garble].
091:53:27 Scott (Spider onboard): We'll be going together this time.
091:53:29 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Fine. [Pause]
091:53:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, let's get our B transmitter on - our B receiver on, too.
091:53:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right.
091:53:36 Schweickart (Spider): We'll configure the same way; we will be - receive A and B and transmit A.
091:53:40 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. And the transponder power is ON.
091:53:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
091:53:43 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Gumdrop, are you ready to support a lighting check?
091:53:49 Scott (Gumdrop): Ready to support.
091:53:51 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, We're going to turn our tracking light on now; see if you can see it. [Pause]
091:54:02 McDivitt (Spider): I don't see anything flashing, do you?
091:54:04 Scott (Gumdrop): [Garble] look down at the porch, Jim.
091:54:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Would you believe it's not flashing?
091:54:12 Scott (Gumdrop): I don't see anything. [Pause]
091:54:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Either that, or we can't tell, huh?
091:54:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I don't think it's flashing, Rusty.
091:54:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I can feel it going, can you feel it?
091:54:19 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
091:54:20 McDivitt (Spider): I don't see anything either.
091:54:21 Schweickart (Spider): I don't see it either, Dave. Just a minute. [Long pause]
091:54:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What circuit breaker is that on?
091:54:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Uh -
091:54:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Lighting? Let's see, the docking [garble].
091:54:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Track, over here. It's closed.
091:54:40 McDivitt (Spider): Houston, are you with us yet?
091:54:45 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, Spider. Do you read?
091:54:49 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, Gumdrop.
091:54:50 Roosa: Houston here. Go ahead.
091:54:54 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. It didn't look like our tracking light was on. I think I might see it right now, though. Yes, Dave, I think I see it flashing.
091:55:01 Roosa: Roger. Copy. And we'd like to have your S-band volumes up at about 57. We'll be in Honeysuckle in about a couple of minutes.
091:55:10 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
091:55:11 McDivitt (Spider): Okay.
091:55:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Dave.
091:55:13 McDivitt (Spider): I see a reflection.
091:55:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): - a regular reflection -
091:55:15 McDivitt (Spider): - on one of the quads out here, so I think it is flashing.
091:55:16 Scott (Gumdrop): Yes, I've got it now, down by the porch now.
091:55:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, I can too, Jim.
091:55:20 Schweickart (Spider): Boy, it's sure not very bright, is it?
091:55:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It sure isn't.
091:55:23 McDivitt (Spider): No, it doesn't seem to be.
091:55:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Its very directional, I'm sure. Okay, here come the docking lights.
091:55:28 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Going to a docking light. [Pause]
091:55:39 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. I've got one of them on the right.
091:55:43 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. That's good enough. We'll leave the docking lights on for you.
091:55:46 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay.
091:55:49 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Why don't you give me your lights?
091:55:52 Scott (Gumdrop): All right. Here comes my monitor lights. [Pause]
091:56:02 McDivitt (Spider): I don't see anything.
Comm break.
091:56:03 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
091:56:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Answer what they call.
091:56:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, I will. I don't see anything up there, Dave.
091:56:14 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay.
091:56:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It's - it's on the other side of the spacecraft, Jim.
091:56:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
091:56:23 Scott (Spider onboard): I don't see anything here, either.
091:56:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, neither do I. Your spotlight doesn't work at all?
091:56:30 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
091:56:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Great.
091:56:42 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
091:56:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What's that?
091:56:47 Scott (Spider onboard): The EL antenna [garble].
091:56:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
091:56:53 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
091:57:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, I see the EVA light. That's all I see.
091:57:08 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay [Garble].
091:57:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, that's okay. I'll probably be just about right for EVA.
091:57:16 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay. [Garble].
091:57:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What's that?
091:57:21 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble] 10 [garble].
091:57:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
091:57:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I think we're getting interference from that other transmitter of his.
091:57:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, don't forget to put the docking target up.
091:57:36 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
091:57:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, very good.
091:57:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, PREP for undocking.
091:57:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let me [garble] ...
091:57:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Configure the cameras. You got everything checked off there?
091:58:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, let me look and see.
We have passed the scheduled time for LOS of signal at Carnarvon tracking station. We have a dropout here - some two minutes between Carnarvon and the Honeysuckle station in the eastern part of Australia. Some of the initial times that are being generated here for the rendezvous sequence are beginning to show up on displays as the Lunar Module, alias Spider, will begin to spin a web around Gumdrop for the next several hours and come back to redock to complete the rendezvous sequence. The display shows the separation burn, which will be done by the Command Module - just a very small burn at 5 feet per second radially downward. That's taking place at 93 hours, 2 minutes, 53 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. This small burn will put the Command Module in an equal period orbit where the maximum seperation from the Lunar Module of some 2.8 miles. We've got Honeysuckle now, Let's listen in.
HONEYSUCKLE (REV 58)
091:58:18 Roosa: Okay. Spider/Gumdrop, Houston through Honeysuckle. How do you read? [Long pause]
091:58:21 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, you want to take a look at the docking target?
091:58:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, go ahead. Ooh, is that ever bright!
091:58:29 Scott (Spider onboard): That's [garble] least [garble].
091:58:33 Scott (Gumdrop): What did you say?
091:58:35 Scott (Spider onboard): That's dim.
091:58:36 Schweickart (Spider): I said give me bright.
091:58:39 Scott (Gumdrop): All right. There's not much difference between them.
091:58:41 Schweickart (Spider): Boy, that thing is really off, Dave. When we come back and try to dock, you are really going to have to keep an eye on me. As a matter of fact [garble] had shifted a little bit from when I looked over it yesterday, I think.
091:58:52 Scott (Gumdrop): Not too much. [Pause]
091:58:58 Schweickart (Spider): All right. It's pretty stationary there. It's just that the [garble] isn't pointed in the right direction. Looks like I'm getting dangerous. I'll just attitude hold and you can do it.
091:59:06 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay.
091:59:08 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, Houston through Honeysuckle. I have your phasing PAD when you are ready to copy [Pause]
091:59:18 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger, Houston. Stand by. I'll get out the phasing PAD.
091:59:23 Roosa: Standing by. [Pause]
091:59:30 McDivitt (Spider): Hey, Dave, did your spotlight ever work at all?
091:59:36 Scott (Gumdrop): No, it hasn't.
091:59:38 McDivitt (Spider): Hey, tell Dave that we're ready to do a phasing PAD.
091:59:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, Dave, I think we're going to ...
091:59:42 McDivitt (Spider): Dave, how about the phasing PAD? Are you ready to copy?
091:59:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ... send up the phasing pad.
091:59:44 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
091:59:46 McDivitt (Spider): I can't hear him now [garble].
091:59:47 Schweickart (Spider): S-band, S-band.
091:59:48 Scott (Gumdrop): We're on S-band. [Pause]
091:59:55 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston. How do you read?
091:59:57 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, now that I have the volume up, I read you pretty good.
091:59:58 McDivitt (Spider): Even though I have my volume up on it, I can't read [garble].
092:00:00 Schweickart (Spider): Spider's ready. [Pause]
092:00:03 Scott (Spider onboard): Gumdrop ready.
092:00:05 Roosa: Roger. Spider/Gumdrop; reading phasing PAD: 093 47 34 00, plus 00 009 all zips, minus 00 907 00 907 000 286, plus 00020 all zips, minus 00907. Your SEP time: 093 02 5300; TPI 0: 094575300. End of update. [Pause]
092:01:32 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. On the readback we've got 093 47 34 00, plus 000 09, all zips, minus 00 907 00 907, all zips 286, plus 00020, all zips, minus 00907; TPI: 0945753. [Pause]
092:02:07 Roosa: Okay, Rusty. Read me your SEP time again. We dropped it there.
092:02:13 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. SEP: 93:02:53.
092:02:17 Roosa: That's right. Houston confirms the PAD. It looks good.
092:02:21 Scott (Gumdrop): And Gumdrop copies.
092:02:24 Schweickart (Spider): Hey, did you agree with the SEP time, Dave?
092:02:27 Scott (Gumdrop): I agree with the [garble].
092:02:30 McDivitt (Spider): Okay.
092:02:31 Schweickart (Spider): Are you transmitting B?
092:02:34 McDivitt (Spider): Negative.
092:02:35 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. We've got a change in our COMM since we reconfigured here. I was just trying to figure out why.
092:02:41 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. I'm transmitting [garble] on.
092:02:44 Scott (Gumdrop): Gone, nothing. [Long pause]
092:02:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We - we don't have - the VHF B transmitter to DATA do we?
092:02:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No. Okay, you want - You don't want that up there now, do you?
092:03:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): This thing?
092:03:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:03:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No [garble] have it up there.
092:03:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You want to stay in 83, here?
092:03:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): For a little while, yes.
092:03:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:03:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, since we don't need this anymore, I'll just deposit it down here.
092:03:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, PREP for undocking. Ready?
092:03:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): PREP for undocking. Roger.
092:03:41 Roosa: And, we're about a minute off Honeysuckle, here, so we'll see you over the Mercury about 10.
092:03:43 Roosa: [Garble] Tananarive [garble].
Comm break.
092:04:53 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop. Copy.
092:04:56 Schweickart (Spider): This is Spider. Roger.
092:03:56 Roosa: [Garble].
Long comm break.
092:04:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, - configure the cameras. I got those, and would you believe we got the right magazines on both cameras?
092:04:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I can't, I can't, I can't!
092:04:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's hard to believe - Go ahead, Houston, Spider.
092:04:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, hold up, Okay, CSM configure for DUPLEX A and RECEIVE A only, and I think he is. LM configure for basic COMM with VHF B backup. Got that. Audio VHF B to RECEIVE, VHF B TRANSMITTER to VOICE, VHF B RECEIVER this - there's no sense in putting the transmitter on.
092:04:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, we're not supposed to have that on.
092:04:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Mount the phasing pad. Set the DET for the RCS SEP time. Okay, SEP time is 93:02:53. 93:02! My aching back! Okay, that's right.
092:05:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): And use 25 minutes before that.
092:05:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 93:02:53, so it's going to be 57 minutes.
092:05:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Have you figured out how you want to configure yourself to look through the AOT, Jim, as far as restraints are concerned?
092:05:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I think I'll just take them off, Rusty.
092:05:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. And Gumdrop, whenever you get your clock set you can give me a hack for the time to SEP.
This is Apollo Control. We've apparently had LOS at the tracking station at Honeysuckle, Australia. During that pass, the maneuver updates were read to the crew for the separation of the lunar module from the command module. That time is 93 hours 02 minutes 53 seconds GET. The time for the phasing maneuver, which will take place half way through what would be called the mini football, where they're out about 3 nautical miles away and checking the rendezvous radar, they go into the second larger football rendezvous portion. The time of that maneuver is 93 hours 47 minutes 34 seconds, and the Delta V, or velocity, will be 90.7 feet per second. This is a radially upward burn which places the lunar module in an orbit that can be described as an equal period. The separation during this particular maneuver will not exceed - stand by one. During the maneuver after the phasing burn, the separation will be some 45 nautical miles in trailing distance, as the command module being in a lower orbit, proceeds out ahead of the lunar module. The tracking ship, Mercury, is upcoming next, at 9 minutes 36 seconds past the hour, some 3 minutes away. At 92 hours 6 minutes GET, this is Apollo Control.
092:06:12 Scott (Spider onboard): Will do.
092:06:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, OVERHEAD HATCH, LOCKED. OVERHEAD DUMP valve in AUTO. PRESSURE REGS A and B in CABIN; LIGHTING EXTERIOR to DOCK; ATTITUDE CONTROL, three, to PULSE.
092:06:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Three, PULSE.
092:06:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): GUIDANCE CONTROL to AGS.
092:06:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): GUIDANCE CONTROL, AGS.
092:07:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MODE SELECT to LANDING RADAR. And we're in the wrong configuration on a lot of these things because we did the rendezvous radar test earlier.
092:07:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right, right.
092:07:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, RANGE ALTITUDE MONITOR to RANGE, RANGE RATE.
092:07:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): RANGE, RANGE RATE.
092:07:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ERROR MONITOR to LANDING RADAR COMPUTER.
092:07:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right.
092:07:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Let's see how they compare now. And ATTITUDE MONITOR to AGS; they look good.
092:07:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Shaft and trunnion are plus or minus 5.
092:07:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 5.
092:07:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CROSS POINTER to HIGH MULT.
092:07:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): There, HIGH MULT.
092:07:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ENGINE ARM to OFF.
092:07:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): OFF.
092:07:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): X-TRANSLATION to 2 JETS.
092:07:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 2 JETS.
092:07:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, BALANCE COUPLE's ON.
092:07:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ON.
092:07:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): DEADBAND, MIN.
092:07:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MIN.
092:07:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD.
092:07:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ATT HOLD.
092:07:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): TTCA, both, to JETS - DOWN, that is.
092:07:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): JETS, DOWN.
092:07:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, RENDEZVOUS RADAR to LGC.
092:07:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's there. LGC.
092:07:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And verify the undocking attitude. Okay, now that's going to be a little bit different this time. It's going to be different by -
092:08:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): How many - how much are we off in minutes?
092:08:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We're off in minutes by - on phasing we're off by 3 minutes exactly, so it's 12 degrees. So instead of being 16, and that will he something different.
092:08:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Say, we're out by 4, 9351 against 9347.
092:08:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 47. Yes; 4 minutes, 16 degrees. Okay. CB(11) R&D INSTRUMENTATION A, CLOSE.
092:08:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): CB(11) R&D INSTRUMENNATION A, CLOSE. Okay?
092:08:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, by damn, there it is. Put my checklist away here. Boy, you just can't - I can't even get into that pocket. (Laughter)
This is Apollo Control, 92 hours 09 minutes ground elapsed time. Should be coming up on the tracking ship Mercury within about 30 seconds, however, if the Carnarvon pass was any indication, we may be a few seconds earlier than that in eavesdropping on the conversation between Gumdrop and Spider as they continue in their pre-rendezvous checklist and systems test. We're standing by for any traffic on the air-ground circuit.
092:09:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What are we set up there for; the phasing or the separation burn?
092:09:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Separation's - Okay. I think I'll put my gloves on for undocking. Okay, Gumdrop; this is Spider here. We're all set up ready to undock. Hey, you done with the 83?
092:09:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let me check it one more time. No, I'm not going to be doing that.
MERCURY (REV 58)
092:09:59 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, Houston through Mercury. [Pause]
092:10:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Roger, Houston; this is Spider.
092:10:13 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, Spider. How do you read?
092:10:15 Roosa: Read you loud and clear, Spider. This is Houston. You are GO for undocking, you are GO for 78 dash 1, your AGS is GO. You can just unscrew the bulb if that light bothers you. And would like to inform you that during the phasing burn and probably also during breaking, you can anticipate a heater CAUTION light coming on. This will be from the RCS and this is after looking at the data that we've got here. There'll be no sweat. [Long pause]
092:10:50 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Thank you. [Long pause]
092:10:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, let me read SEP 1: Prepare phasing pad. We got that. Set cameras. Verify CB(11), STAB/CONTROL AELD, OPEN.
092:11:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): AELD, OPEN.
092:11:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): DECA POWER, OPEN.
092:11:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): DECA POWER, OPEN.
092:11:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Earth orbit R&D INSTRUMENTATION A, CLOSED.
092:11:22 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, Gumdrop. [Long pause]
092:11:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): R&D INSTRUMENTATION A, CLOSED.
092:11:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): DFI POWER, OFF.
092:11:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): DFI POWER, OFF.
092:11:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): R&D B, CLOSED.
092:11:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): R&D B, CLOSED.
092:11:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CB(16) STAB and CONTROL AELD, OPEN in DESCENT ENGINE OVERRIDE.
092:11:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): AELD, OPEN.
092:11:36 Scott (Gumdrop): Spider, Gumdrop.
092:11:38 Schweickart (Spider): Go ahead, Gumdrop. Spider,
092:11:39 Scott (Gumdrop): I'll give you a Mark at 51:10. Okay?
092:11:42 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
092:11:44 Scott (Gumdrop): One.
092:11:45 Scott (Gumdrop): Mark.
092:11:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1 second off.
092:11:47 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. We're off by about a second.
092:11:50 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Pause]
092:11:55 McDivitt (Spider): Hey, you sure sound funny all of a sudden; say something again.
092:11:59 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Something again. I just switch to the other...
092:12:03 Schweickart (Spider): All right; you sounded garbled. [Long pause]
092:12:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Good.
092:12:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, that clock is 1 second fast, Jim, here. We could go to STOP then START again - on it.
092:12:24 Scott (Spider onboard): Houston, Gumdrop.
092:12:26 Scott (Gumdrop): Spider, Gumdrop [garble]. [Pause]
092:12:34 Scott (Spider onboard): Spider, Gumdrop. You been able to contact Houston?
092:12:38 Schweickart (Spider): Houston. Spider. Do you read?
092:12:42 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. I'm reading you loud and clear.
092:12:45 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Gumdrop's trying to call you.
092:12:47 Scott (Spider onboard): Houston, Gumdrop.
092:12:48 Roosa: Gumdrop, this is Houston. How do you read?
092:12:50 Scott (Spider onboard): Loud and clear; and me?
092:12:53 Scott (Gumdrop): I'm [garble].
092:12:54 Roosa: You're breaking up slightly and way down, Gumdrop.
092:13:00 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. That fuel cell 2 [garble] and I've got a fuel cell 2 light. Just thought I'd let you know. [Pause]
092:13:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Say, that can sure change radios fast.
092:13:11 Roosa: Roger. Understand. Fuel cell 2 light and that's from the TCE?
092:13:14 Scott (Gumdrop): That's affirmative.
092:13:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, no.
092:13:17 Roosa: Okay. And you're loud and clear now, Gumdrop.
092:13:22 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Pause]
092:13:26 Schweickart (Spider): You're still a little garbled to me, Gumdrop. Whatever you did in the last few minutes, it sure changed the character of your radio.
092:13:31 Scott (Gumdrop): Let me go back the other way.
092:13:34 McDivitt (Spider): Gumdrop, it wasn't that; it was when you switched to the rendezvous configuration, I believe.
092:13:40 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Let me try it the other way.
092:13:45 Scott (Gumdrop): How is it now?
092:13:46 Scott (Spider onboard): What?
092:13:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Just that -
092:13:48 McDivitt (Spider): It's about the same.
092:13:51 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay.
092:13:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Wonder what changed?
092:13:53 McDivitt (Spider): Now it changed. [Long pause]
092:13:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Maybe he changed something on his COMM configuration.
092:13:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I didn't hear what he said.
092:14:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, that was from one panel to another. You want to get that - you want to set the mission timer; right, Jim?
092:14:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, let's see what it is. Let's [garble] - get up - [garble]...
092:14:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oops - VERB 16, NOUN 65, ENTER. I think you can go to STOP and START VERB; just 1 second.
092:14:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Seems about a half a second off.
092:14:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, why don't you just flip it there.
092:14:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let me see what we can do here.
092:14:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Rats, now it's a half a second off the other way.
092:14:42 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston.
092:14:45 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, Gumdrop. Go.
092:14:48 Roosa: Okay. That TCE's hanging right on the ragged edge, Dave - on that caution and warning trip. And we'll be keeping an eye on it for you, but it might trip off here a couple of times during the rendezvous. [Pause]
092:15:03 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay; very well. Thank you.
092:15:05 Roosa: Roger. [Pause]
092:15:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, we'll be fast.
092:15:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, no fooling around.
092:15:11 Roosa: And, troops, I'm going to lose you here. We'll see you over the sunny Grand Bahamas at about 36.
092:15:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): This is Spider. Roger.
092:15:20 Schweickart (Spider): Roger.
092:15:21 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop.
Very long comm break.
092:15:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay; let's continue on down here then.
092:15:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:15:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I got my breakers OPEN. Verify COMM configuration. GUIDANCE CONTROL to AGS.
092:15:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): AGS.
092:15:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): DEADBAND, MIN.
092:15:39 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MIN.
092:15:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ATT CONTROL, three, to PULSE.
092:15:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): PULSE.
092:15:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MODE CONTROL ATTITUDE, HOLD.
092:15:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ATT HOLD.
092:15:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): VERB 37, ENTER 00 - I know we got that, VERB 76, ENTER.
092:15:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ENTER.
092:15:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): VERB 63, ENTER.
092:15:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): VERB 63, ENTER.
092:15:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): EXTERIOR LIGHTING to DOCK - I got that. COAS FOWER to FORWARD, and COAS BRIGHTNESS, ADJUSTED.
092:16:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, I've done that.
092:16:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): VERIFY the DAP at 01002.
092:16:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 01002. Okay, we look pretty good.
092:16:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:16:20 Scott (Spider onboard): Spider, Gumdrop. I'm going to start maneuvering [garble] for the undocking attitude.
092:16:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, fine. We're all all ready to go here.
092:16:28 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay. Very good.
092:16:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You know something?
092:16:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What?
092:16:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): My FLOW CONTROL valves have been in VERTICAL since yesterday.
092:16:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): (Laughter)
092:16:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No wonder my fingers are warm.
And this is Apollo Control. We've now had loss of signal at the tracking ship Mercury. During that pass the crew of Apollo 9 were given the GO for undocking which will take place shortly after they begin this next pass over the Eastern Test Range; Grand Bahama, Antigua and the tracking ship Vanguard and on over to Canary Islands and Madrid. Some 27 minutes altogether overlapping passes over those stations. They were also given a routine GO for revolution 78 and landing area 1. The maneuver pad for phasing was read up to them. The undocking will take place, as mentioned earlier, just after acquisition at the Antigua tracking station and that will begin many hours of very complicated maneuvers by both the spacecraft and an Earth orbit simulation of the type of job that will have to be done in lunar orbit on the subsequent lunar orbital and lunar landing missions. Acquisition time at Grand Bahamas is 35 minutes 27 seconds past the hour to begin the aforementioned 27 minute continuous pass. At 92 hours 17 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
092:17:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It also helps a little with the COMM.
092:17:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I had my volumes all the way up already.
092:17:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Really?
092:17:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:17:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:17:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): VHF A, B, and MASTER are all full UP.
092:17:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'm pretty far down on all of them.
092:17:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): How are the reflections in the window?
092:17:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Terrible.
092:17:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Are they?
092:17:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I'll get into right configuration here and see how they are.
092:17:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, I've got my side panels OFF now.
092:17:39 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I cleared my ears; that might help.
092:17:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Ha, - the reflections?
092:17:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, that makes the reflection a lot less. They're not too bad. I can see you, all of you.
092:17:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Here, let's turn this around so it doesn't shine on you. Yes, there you go.
092:17:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That helps a little.
092:18:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Man, this is going to be a long hungry day; I can feel it already.
092:18:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 9 hours to go almost.
092:18:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Huh.
092:18:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I know what I want to do. I want to look through here.
092:18:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I don't see much out there.
092:18:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Would you believe our radar is back up in view again?
092:18:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, well, it's supposed to be. It's not all the way up, is it? It's on the bottom of the field?
092:18:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, it's in the bottom of the field.
092:18:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. That's where we put it 323, not the 283 -
092:18:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Uh huh.
092:18:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And with his light shining in, it shines right in to the - right into there, so I can't see anything.
092:19:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's hope that 283 is better.
092:19:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): What's that?
092:19:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, let's hope that the 283 is better.
092:19:14 Scott (Spider onboard): Yes; well, with his light shining in the telescope I couldn't see anything anyway.
092:19:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, he's got his lights on, huh?
092:19:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:19:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Can I help you back there?
092:19:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, I just want to get the eye patch out.
092:19:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): What's he got his docking target on?
092:19:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): There's e - EVA light ON.
092:19:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): (Yawn)
092:19:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's on the EVA RUNNING LIGHT SWITCH.
092:19:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hell, he didn't - oh. - Uh huh.
092:20:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Boy, that stuff up there is really all reflected in the window.
092:20:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It is?
092:20:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:20:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): How's that?
092:20:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Looks better.
092:20:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, how's that?
092:20:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Looks better. I can see all of it. Wait a minute.
092:20:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, we got everything up pretty bright.
092:20:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You know that doggone AGS light doesn't help any either.
092:20:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): (Laughter) Yes.
092:20:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Punch something up on your DEDA. Let's say -
092:20:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay?
092:20:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): How light. How bright the lights are. I'm going to power up the -
092:21:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, the balance is pretty good.
092:21:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:21:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): The trouble is we're going to undock in the daytime, so we're going to need it up bright.
092:21:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. I just wanted to see what it looks at night.
092:21:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. You can turn your side panels off, too. That will help.
092:21:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:21:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Matter of fact, the DSKY goes off before the DEDA does.
092:21:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. That - that's a switch.
092:21:48 Scott (Spider onboard): Gumdrop, we've got 41 minutes to the SEP BURN.
092:21:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
092:21:54 Scott (Spider onboard): Right with you.
092:21:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] ful.
092:22:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What kind of stars have we got out there? There's the Big Dipper right in front of us. [Garble] right in front of us. And there is -
092:22:10 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble] and about 15 more degrees to go.
092:22:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:22:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): There's Leo.
092:22:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): There's Corvus.
092:22:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): There's really a bright planet out there. What the heck planet is over by Leo?
092:22:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): The Moon looks like it's around over in Spica -
092:22:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Leo, near Leo has got to be our friend; isn't it Venus? Really bright.
092:22:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, very bright.
092:22:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I can't quite see it. Oh, yes, it's down there. Let me see if I can see him out here. No, I can't because of the camera. Yes, that's Venus. He's minus 4.3 magnitude; would you believe that? Okay, our attitude is - it's not 180 yet, but it's getting there. 300, and we're at about 14. Let me see the PGNS.
092:23:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): He must be in WIDE DEADBAND.
092:23:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I'm sure he is.
092:23:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I sure wish we had those letters on there.
092:23:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:24:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Damn it; oh, is that in the Systems Book?
092:24:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, it is.
092:24:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You want to try to do that now?
092:24:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:24:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:24:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Can you get the Systems Book?
092:24:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:24:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Here, I think I can probably get it easier than you.
092:24:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh shoot, I can't quite reach it. Okay, it's - it's the top one. That's it. Okay, I got it.
092:24:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, if you want to read them to me out of - on that diagram, hold on; I want to take off my gloves, and I'll write them up there.
092:25:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Say again, Dave.
092:25:09 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble] activity up.
092:25:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:25:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We're on the NOMINAL along there.
092:25:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, we should be, as far as attitude and stuff goes. Okay?
092:25:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, we're 4 minutes early.
092:25:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, it doesn't make any difference. They REFSMMAT us to a different place then. Okay, SYSTEMS A QUAD 1 is UP and FORWARD.
092:25:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Quad, let me see where I want to put it now. QUAD 1, okay, 1 is [garble] and FORWARD. There. Okay.
092:25:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): QUAD 2, SYSTEM A is AFT and DOWN.
092:25:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): AFT and DOWN.
092:25:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): QUAD 3 is UP and RIGHT.
092:25:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): QUAD 3 is UP and RIGHT.
092:26:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): QUAD 4 is DOWN and RIGHT.
092:26:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): DOWN and RIGHT.
092:26:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, SYSTEMS B. SYSTEM B QUAD 1 is DOWN and LEFT.
092:26:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): DOWN and LEFT.
092:26:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): QUAD 2 is UP and LEFT.
092:26:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): UP and LEFT.
092:26:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): QUAD 3 is DOWN and AFT.
092:26:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): DOWN and AFT.
092:26:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): And QUAD 4 is UP - UP and FORWARD.
092:26:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): UP, FORWARD.
092:26:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Just a minute, Dave.
092:26:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Check the attitude against what we've got there in the book.
092:26:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, roll?
092:27:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, it looks like you're off a couple degrees in your roll.
092:27:07 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, I'd believe that.
092:27:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I guess you got to roll right a couple more?
092:27:14 Scott (Spider onboard): Now roll left.
092:27:35 Scott (Spider onboard): Roll left?
092:27:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 055. I'm not sure that our ORDEAL is working worth a hoot.
092:27:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Not on ours; it didn't roll left.
092:27:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Don't argue with him about which way we're going to roll here.
092:27:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, but we have an attitude problem then.
092:27:57 Scott (onboard): That should be right lined up now.
092:28:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you agree with me?
092:28:08 Schweickart (onboard): What is your roll angle?
092:28:10 Scott (onboard): 180.
092:28:13 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, I know what our problem is. It's the docking ring angle and it's - So we should read 2 degrees more than normal. Okay, let's go.
092:28:21 Scott (onboard): How about that?
092:28:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Whew, figured it out. 302.36. That's right; that's right.
092:28:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we agree then.
092:29:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Say, Regulus is one of the stars we use for our star check two, isn't it?
092:29:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It's the third star check on the second alignment.
092:29:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right over there by the Moon.
092:29:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Doggone it, the tape is on. I wonder when I turn that on?
092:32:54 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble] 5 minutes on my mark.
092:32:55 McDivitt (onboard): MARK.
092:32:57 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
This is Apollo Control at 92 hours 34 minutes GET. We're some 1 minute 20 seconds away from acquisition at Grand Bahama Islands on continuous pass across the lower part of the eastern test range on over to the tracking ship Vanguard, Canary Islands, and Madrid. One of the first items to take place during this pass will be the undocking of the command module from the lunar module. This is done when the command module pilot Dave Scott will trip a switch in the cockpit to extend the docking probe and this in turn deactivates the 12 latches that hold the two docking collars together, and provides a general nudge to the lunar module, to move it away at probably a foot per second away from the command module. Before there are any further separation, the command module pilot will take a sequence of still and motion pictures of the lunar module. First a fairly closeup range of about 10 feet of some of the RCS quads on the lunar module, then they'll move out to 45 to 50 feet while the lunar module does a sort of pirouette for inspection photograhs at all angles, including a pitch over where the pictures can be made of the descent stage. Here comes the transmition now through the Grand Bahamas.
BAHAMAS (REV 59)
092:35:40 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, Houston. How do you read?
092:35:47 Scott (Gumdrop): Reading you five-by, Houston.
092:35:50 Roosa: Roger, Gumdrop. If you've got time now, we'd like for you go ACCEPT so during this busy period we can ship you a state vector. We'll not give you a NAV check; we'll do a vector compare.
092:36:00 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Going to ACCEPT now.
092:36:02 Roosa: Roger. Thank you.
092:36:12 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, this is Spider. We're reading you also, now.
092:36:15 Roosa: Very good; you're loud and clear. Standing by for your undocking.
092:36:18 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. [Long pause]
092:36:55 Scott (Gumdrop): One minute.
092:36:57 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. We're ready. [Long pause]
092:37:25 Scott (Gumdrop): Ready.
092:37:26 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. [Long pause]
092:37:45 Scott (Gumdrop): 10. [Pause]
092:37:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 5 seconds, UNDOCK.
092:37:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
092:37:52 Scott (Gumdrop): 3, 2, 1.
092:37:54 Scott (Gumdrop): UNDOCK. [Pause]
092:37:57 Schweickart (Spider): Uh-oh. We didn't release.
092:37:58 Scott (Spider onboard): No, it's hung.
092:38:00 Scott (Gumdrop): Hang on something. [Pause]
092:38:06 Scott (Spider onboard): I'll reinsert and pull backwards.
092:38:08 Scott (Gumdrop): We have a short pull backwards.
092:38:10 Schweickart (Spider): Say again.
092:38:12 Scott (Gumdrop): I said would you hang on something. I'm going to pull you back a little bit.
092:38:14 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. [Pause]
092:38:24 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. We're nice and stable with respect to you. [Long pause]
092:38:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, we - we're hanging on to the end of the probe, Rusty, and Dave is maneuvering around, and he's getting straight, and we're going to redock.
ANTIGUA (REV 59)
092:39:01 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. We seem to be banging; it seems like the probe's out; the capture latches haven't released.
092:39:05 Schweickart (Spider): Yes. That's what it looks like.
092:39:09 Schweickart (Spider): We're pretty stable here. Wonder what's wrong with it?
092:39:15 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, got any suggestions?
092:39:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No - You know -
092:39:17 Roosa: We're copying all that, Gumdrop and Spider. Stand by. [Long pause]
092:39:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Jim, we probably ought to thrust up when we - oh, no - that's right -
092:39:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, we're captured.
092:39:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We're captured.
092:39:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] We're all right.
092:39:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, if - if all of them are still hanging.
092:39:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, we're alright.
092:39:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] we're - we,re solid. You could really feel that yank on it, so -
092:39:36 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. You're free.
092:39:38 Schweickart (Spider): I'm free?
092:39:39 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger.
092:39:40 Schweickart (Spider): What did you do?
092:39:41 Scott (Gumdrop): Oh, went back to the old memory and put a cycle on the switch, and you look like you're free.
092:39:46 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Great.
092:39:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Did you deploy?
092:39:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, go to MODE CONROL.
092:39:51 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. We're going to start you around now.
092:39:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:39:54 Scott (Gumdrop): Hold off.
092:39:56 Schweickart (Spider): What?
092:39:57 Scott (Gumdrop): Wait a minute.
092:39:59 Schweickart (Spider): I can't hear you.
092:40:01 Scott (Gumdrop): Hold. Wait a minute till I get clear.
092:40:02 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
092:40:05 Scott (Gumdrop): Now you're clear.
092:40:06 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. [Long pause]
092:40:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Easy. Hey, you got about 3 degrees per second on that.
092:40:12 Scott (Spider onboard): Ooops. Okay.
092:40:13 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, go again.
092:40:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Now.
092:40:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Keep it over there, Jim.
092:40:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, got it.
092:40:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, I guess we'll see at the end of the rendezvous whether all that's going to work.
092:40:30 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Our attitudes are a little screwed up now Dave, so we may have a little problem with that.
092:40:35 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. I noticed.
092:40:37 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. I'm stationkeeping on you now, so no sweat.
092:40:40 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Long pause]
092:41:10 Scott (Gumdrop): Spider, I'm going to stay in plane and just follow you with the pitch.
092:41:14 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Fine. How am I drifting away from you?
092:41:16 Scott (Spider onboard): You're drifting out of plane.
092:41:17 Scott (Gumdrop): Elliptic, out of plane. To your rear.
092:41:22 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Well, I can't notice that. My REG's look good, except my yaw rate is going around about 1 degree per second. [Pause]
092:41:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, the flight control system is reasonably stable -
092:41:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): After we get over to the bellyband we could roll [garble].
092:41:39 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
092:41:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:41:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Up - upright first?
092:41:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I think so.
092:41:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:41:45 Scott (Gumdrop): Are you yawing now?
092:41:47 McDivitt (Spider): That's right. I'm yawing right now. I'm doing my 120-degree yaw. When I get over here, Dave, why don't I just stop the yaw and roll - my roll so that I'm up, rightside up, on the bellyband. Then it'll get back to maybe about the right attitude, at least in plane.
092:42:01 Scott (Gumdrop): Good idea. [Long pause]
092:42:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Stand by - stand by.
092:42:22 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble] 6 hours. 8
092:42:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
092:42:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hit it. There.
092:42:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Shoot, let me just maneuver it over there.
092:42:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You want it in PULSE to MANEUVER.
092:42:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, put in PULSE.
092:42:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You're in PULSE.
092:42:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): This hand controller is really bad news.
092:42:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roll PULSE?
092:42:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, let me take it over in yaw first.
092:42:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:42:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, go to ATTITUDE HOLD.
092:42:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you got MODE CONTROL?
092:42:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. You want roll PULSE?
092:42:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, give me roll PULSE.
092:42:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble]. You got it?
092:43:00 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, Dave. I'm going to roll up in plane now. [Long pause]
092:43:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Boy, every time you do that, we get that - oh, I get it. We should get that though. Start getting fluctuations in the manifold - yes - but that's right.
092:43:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, let's pitch at a little higher rate, Jim, to catch up here.
092:43:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, wait a second. Why don't you just - let's just forego some of the inspection, at least get each other squared away here.
092:43:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, well, we can see how it works out.
092:43:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:43:30 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, Dave. I'm going to come rightside up here now, and when I get hit there, then I'll just stop and you can position yourself.
092:43:36 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Long pause]
092:43:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:44:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We're not going - we're not going to do the pitch, 180-degree pitch.
CANARY (REV 59)
092:44:05 McDivitt (Spider): We won't do the 180-degree pitch, Dave; we'll just do the 90-degree pitch up here.
092:44:09 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Good idea. [Long pause]
092:44:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Get over there.
092:44:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, go to ATTITUDE HOLD
092:44:31 Scott (Gumdrop): I think it would be all right if we just get some relative attitudes, because I'm going to maneuver to the proper attitude for the SEP, and you can line up on me there.
092:44:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right. Okay.
092:44:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, ready for the pitch?
092:44:37 McDivitt (Spider): Right. Okay. Okay. I'm going to do the pitch-around maneuver, and I'm going to pitch 90 degrees only.
092:44:43 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Fine.
092:44:44 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. I'm going to start now.
092:44:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, I'm going to start. Ready.
092:44:46 Scott (Gumdrop): You're clear. [Long pause]
092:44:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay there. Oh shoot, now. (Laughter) Just by accident - okay, you got - that's the other one's fine. Okay, camera coming out. All set. Boy, that Sun is going to be right in the wrong place for - for these pictures, holy smoke.
092:45:21 Scott (Spider onboard): It's...
092:45:22 Scott (Gumdrop): ...looking good.
092:45:23 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. [Long pause]
092:45:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Jim, I'll be ready to hit the hand controller.
092:45:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I can get it.
092:45:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, that's okay. I'll get it. You got to hit that doggone hand controller so fast there.
092:45:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I think - let me try - I could - I could do better myself if I knew when - when it was going to get hit.
092:45:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:45:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): How's he coming?
092:45:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I don't know; I don't see him yet.
092:45:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Here he comes.
092:46:01 Scott (Gumdrop): That's a nice looking machine.
092:46:03 McDivitt (Spider): So is yours. [Pause]
092:46:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): He is over here in the left.
092:46:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, shoot - no wonder - oh, there he is.
092:46:09 Scott (Gumdrop): That's about all it looks like, though, is some sort of machine.
092:46:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You sure you don't want me to get it, Jim?
092:46:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, I'll get it.
092:46:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:46:16 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, Dave. When I get about perpendicular to you, I'm going to stop and start my yaw to the left.
092:46:22 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Pause]
092:46:31 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. I'm going to start my yaw right now.
092:46:32 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Keep...
092:46:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, - do you want to - okay.
092:46:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, why don't you get some pictures.
092:46:35 Scott (Gumdrop): Go ahead. [Long pause]
092:46:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:46:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We're not that far behind, Jim. We're - we've got lots of time.
092:46:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We're supposed to start that in 18 minutes, so we're just about - just about there.
092:47:16 Scott (Gumdrop): I think we're in good shape, attitude-wise.
092:47:18 McDivitt (Spider): Yes. We only got off about 20 or 30 degrees, there, Dave.
092:47:22 Scott (Gumdrop): Yes. [Long pause]
092:47:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Try another setting here real quick.
092:47:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): His flashing beacon is working, by the way.
092:47:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I saw that.
092:47:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:48:07 Scott (Gumdrop): All the downlocks look good so far.
092:48:10 McDivitt (Spider): That's very good. [Long pause]
092:48:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, let me get this off of here.
092:48:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh no, I want to keep it there, that's right.
092:48:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Woo! Forgot.
092:48:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): On shoot, I think our COAS is crapped up.
092:48:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, that's a pretty bright background.
092:48:50 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, Houston. Sometime within the next 4 minutes let's get - Be sure your S-band volume is up. We'll be going over to Madrid.
092:48:57 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Spider.
092:48:58 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop. [Long pause]
092:49:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, I think that - Okay, you can - you can - discuss the thing on the tape here; we got that on.
092:49:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, the attitude control in - in AGS every bit as bad as it is in the simulator, I think.
092:49:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CB(11), STAB CONTROL DECA POWER, CLOSED, first, Jim.
092:49:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. DECA POWER, CLOSE.
092:49:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right. Okay, and I got DESCENT ENGINE OVERRIDE, CLOSE.
092:49:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:49:34 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:49:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I really think we've lost the God-blessed COAS.
092:49:51 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. I've got 13 minutes before the SEP burn.
092:49:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:49:56 McDivitt (Spider): Would you believe it, but I think COAS went out. Oh, there [garble].
092:49:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh no, there it is over there. Okay.
092:50:01 Unidentifiable Crewmember: [Garble] Okay.
092:50:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You got it against the right stop, Jim?
092:50:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What?
092:50:04 Scott (Gumdrop): Is it okay? [Long pause]
092:50:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You have it against the right stop?
092:50:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:50:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:50:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 93, 00, 00 - [garble] 0093, ENTER; plus 00000, ENTER; 09300, ENTER - Oops! Try it again; VERB 25, NOUN 84, ENTER.
092:50:42 Scott (Gumdrop): I'm getting a look at your engine down here, and it looks pretty clean.
092:50:46 McDivitt (Spider): Good.
092:50:49 McDivitt (Spider): I can't see much except your nose, so - Right now, I can't even see that.
Comm break.
092:50:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, how close are - we're still a little ways away.
092:51:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Boy, if you ever got out against that sunlight that, we'd have it.
092:51:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 30 degrees of yaw remain. We want to go GUIDANCE CONTROL to PGNS.
092:51:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): PGNS now. Oh yes, oh yes.
092:51:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] you got -
092:51:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Let me get a picture of that. Oh boy, that's pretty. I'll get the whole thing with you in the foreground sort of.
092:51:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, go ahead - let's just take a picture of him, the heck with it.
092:52:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, I'll call up the VERB 77 -
092:52:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, not - okay, just hit the 77. Okay, GUIDANCE CONTROL to PGNS, MODE CON - ATTITUDE CONTROL to MODE CONTROL YAW. Okay. Call on the ENTER.
092:52:18 Scott (Gumdrop): I can see your skip rudder when I back off just a bit.
092:52:21 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. [Long pause]
092:52:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, and this ought to be in nice style.
092:52:31 Scott (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:52:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, 3, 2, 1.
092:52:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): HACK.
092:52:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's not bad.
092:52:42 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, Dave. We can take over the stationkeeping here.
092:52:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, hit the VERB 77 ENTER.
092:52:48 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay.
092:52:51 Scott (Gumdrop): I've got a slight up movement on you.
092:52:54 McDivitt (Spider): Okay.
092:52:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, GUIDANCE CONTROL to AGS.
092:52:56 Scott (Gumdrop): You've got the stationkeeping.
092:52:57 McDivitt (Spider): I have the stationkeeping.
092:52:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Stationkeeping. Let's see - let me look at the AGS here. Okay, GUIDANCE CONTROL to AGS. You ready.
092:53:00 Scott (Gumdrop): Did you say your COAS was out?
092:53:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No.
092:53:02 McDivitt (Spider): It's working; it's so dim I just can't see it.
092:53:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You ready, Jim?
092:53:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): To AGS - go ahead.
092:53:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we are in AGS. Okay, LM in active stationkeeping. VERB 83, ENTER. Okay, and you want to adjust ORDEAL. Okay, he must be over your side.
092:53:06 Scott (Gumdrop): I got the same.
092:53:25 Scott (Spider onboard): God-blessed, that ORDEAL isn't working at all, Rusty.
092:53:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It isn't.
092:53:28 Scott (Spider onboard): No.
092:53:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 153 degrees.
092:53:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, I don't know if you can set it out of plane.
092:53:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I can set it out of plane - set it out of plane before, at least it stays somewhere near -
092:53:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Have you got the power on and everything?
092:53:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:53:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And Earth rate.
092:53:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:53:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 153.6. Okay, PROCEED. Let me just check that here. What do you want - you want to take a picture of him [garble].
092:53:55 Scott (Spider onboard): I'm starting to maneuver to SEP attitude at this time.
092:53:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:54:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Gee, yes, I'd like to get a picture of him. Oh, shoot. Can you yaw a little bit, Jim.
092:54:10 Scott (Spider onboard): No, I'm not going to do that. That AGS Control is - just won't work.
092:54:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Try it in PULSE.
092:54:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Can you do it in PULSE?
092:54:15 Scott (Spider onboard): I'm translating over there slowly.
092:54:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:54:21 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, I'll just miss his attitude maneuver.
092:54:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Did you get the lens cover off? You got the lens cover on, haven't you?
092:54:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, you do. (Laughter) Great!
092:54:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, why don't you give me the - this camera.
092:54:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, here go ahead.
092:54:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You want me to stationkeep just a bit?
092:54:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, we'll just let it run.
092:54:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:55:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): My window is in the shade here, I don't know how we ever - I guess we didn't really figure the Sun very well for that, did we? We figured the Sun ought -
092:55:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 17 minutes - it's 7 minutes ...
092:55:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Did you set any - can you get movies of him now?
092:55:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, he's - he's up too high and over too far.
092:55:33 Scott (Spider onboard): Why don't you unmount the camera and try to hold it.
092:55:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I can't even see him, Jim.
092:55:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:55:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you ready to go to PGNS?
092:55:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I'm ready to go back to PGNS.
092:55:59 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, going to PGNS.
Long comm break.
Apollo Control here some 3 minutes away from loss of signal at Madrid. While Spider does some maneuvers out some 50 feet away from the command module, the command module pilot Dave Scott is making sequence and still photographs of the lunar module at the various attitudes including looking directly down the nozzle of the large engine bell of the descent stage. We'll continue to monitor the circuit as the two spacecraft drift on toward the time for the separation burn which will begin the mini-football.
This is Apollo Control. Apparently both spacecraft and their crews are busy with their cameras at this time taking pictures of each other. We've had no communications lately between the two spacecraft or with the ground. We'll leave the circuit up until Madrid loss of signal, which is about a minute away.
092:56:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Here, why don't you hold on to this?
092:56:02 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, tape we're going back -
092:56:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Why don't you hold this and let me turn it to PGNS - I don't want to not have my hand on the handle.
092:56:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:56:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we're in PGNS - and if you want to comment on the AGS ATTITUDE HOLD there -
092:56:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes - didn't seem to be too bad -
092:56:19 Scott (Spider onboard): Well, AGS ATTITUDE HOLD if you don't have to - ATTITUDE HOLD is good; it's the RATE COMMAND that's so atrocious.
092:56:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble].
MADRID (REV 59)
092:56:32 Roosa: Okay, Spider/Gumdrop. We're going to lose you here within a minute at Madrid. We'll see you over Carnarvon around 23. [Pause]
092:56:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Can you see him at all now?
092:56:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Just barely. Can you get a little higher, Jim?
092:56:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I'll start - I'm moving up that way now. Okay?
092:56:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, let me have it back now that we've - made this switch.
092:56:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:56:44 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Gumdrop copy. Carnarvon at 23.
092:56:48 Roosa: That's affirmative.
092:56:51 Scott (Gumdrop): Hey, Spider...
092:56:52 Scott (onboard): ...I'm just about at the attitude now in...
092:56:53 Scott (Gumdrop): ...plane... [Long pause]
092:56:54 Scott (onboard): ...and the roll is the [garble]...
092:56:55 Scott (Spider onboard): ... like your...
092:56:56 Scott (onboard): ... attitude [garble]...
092:56:57 Scott (Spider onboard): ...too.
092:56:58 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, you look good to us.
092:57:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We're drifting over slowly to the right and up, Rusty.
092:57:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): To the left and up?
092:57:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): To - to the left, yes.
092:57:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. He's coming over our right, and we're going -
092:57:12 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, your vector is good. We've looked at it; the computer is yours, of course, and you can go BLOCK any time.
Very long comm break.
092:57:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, he's coming now.
092:57:19 Scott (onboard): Okay; thanks, Smokey.
092:57:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Boy, we're sure not hearing them.
092:57:21 McDivitt (onboard): If this COMM doesn't improve, David, we're going to have an awfully quiet rendezvous.
092:57:31 Scott (onboard): Roger.
092:57:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, I - Why don't you take the pictures and and -
092:57:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:57:49 Scott (onboard): Crew, I have 5 minutes on my mark. 2, 1 -
092:57:53 Scott (onboard): MARK.
092:57:54 McDivitt (onboard): Roger; we're right with you.
092:57:55 Schweickart (onboard): Right with you.
092:57:56 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:57:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Are you stationkeeping now?
092:58:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well - why don't we just let it drift?
092:58:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:58:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's not going anyplace.
092:58:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That was my one chance. (Laughter)
092:58:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You'll get another chance.
092:58:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, I won't - where?
092:58:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Not until we get back.
092:58:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, looks like we've got just a little bit of roll.
092:58:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:58:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, that's enough on the movies, let me go back to business here.
092:58:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, VERB 84. You have that all loaded?
092:58:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): VERB 84 is all loaded.
092:58:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
092:58:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, when he starts up -
092:58:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'm ready with the VERB 76. Okay, let me take a few - Oh hell, you've got a - You want me to take some more that way? You've got 3 minutes here.
092:59:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, I don't want to take any more pictures.
092:59:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'll try to get one here.
092:59:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): There goes a name-plate off of something.
092:59:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, I see it.
092:59:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
092:59:30 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, I got to get - I got to get into 76 here, Rusty.
092:59:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger. 76 is right here, and I'm all ready to hit ENTER.
092:59:42 Scott (Spider onboard): It's all set up.
092:59:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): OFF, damn it; tape OFF, CLOSED.
092:59:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): AOT LAMP BREAKER is CLOSE.
092:59:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): AC BUS B only, right?
092:59:52 Scott (Spider onboard): AC BUS B; that's right. Okay.
This is Apollo Control. Apparently we have had loss of signal at the Madrid, Spain tracking station. As the two spacecraft came across Grand Bahamas and on into Antigua tracking station tracking range, they were docked but the time I copied of actual undocking was 92:39:30 ground elapsed time. There was some difficulty in getting the capture latches of the docking collar to release properly and it took two attempts by command module pilot Dave Scott to get the probe fully extended to where the latches would release the lunar module. McDivitt and Schweikart in the lunar module proceeded to maneuver out; first at a short distance of about 10 feet for photographs of the RCS thruster quads on the LM, then moved further out to 45 to 50 feet for a turn around while facing the command module for a photography sequence, pitch over for a photograph of the descent stage and the descent engine bell. Some of the comments during that period of photography in inspection included one by Scott saying, you have a nice looking machine there. McDivitt responded so's yours. The command module rendezvous radar transponder was scheduled to be turned on shortly after the undocking. The lunar module rendezvous radar will be turned on after the separation burn, which is coming up at 2 minutes past the hour. This will be a radially down burn using the command module RCS thrusters to place the command module in a equal period orbit which will produce a separation distance for a mini-football of less than 3 nautical miles. The phasing burn which is a burn by the descent propulsion system of the lunar module of some 90.7 feet-per second will be radially up. This again is scheduled at 93 hours 47 minutes 34 seconds and it will take place over the tracking ship Mercury. Just at acquistion, there will be a Mission Control Center GO-NO GO for this phasing burn. The earlier separation burn for the mini-football will take place at 93 hours 02 minutes 53 seconds and will be out of contact with any ground tracking stations. Probably as the large wall map shows, over the Red Sea and the Arabian peninsula. At 93 hours ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
093:02:25 Scott (onboard): 30 seconds. Average g is NOM.
093:02:27 Schweickart (onboard): Roger.
093:02:50 Scott (onboard): 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
093:02:55 Scott (onboard): BANG.
093:03:21 Scott (onboard): Okay, 5 feet per second.
093:03:23 Schweickart (onboard): Roger. Looks good. Okay, zero residual.
093:03:30 Scott (onboard): Roger.
093:03:34 Schweickart (onboard): Hey, I'm getting a VERB 80. Okay, you just want to track them on the COAS. Right. AC breaker in place? VERB [garble].
093:03:45 Scott (onboard): Right.
093:03:55 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble] get the AC breaker in. Did you get a time on?
093:03:58 McDivitt (onboard): No, I didn't.
093:04:00 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, I'll call you when it's about...
093:04:03 McDivitt (onboard): It was about 59 there.
093:04:04 Schweickart (onboard): Say again.
093:04:05 McDivitt (onboard): It was about -
093:04:09 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, we'll make sure.
093:04:15 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, Gumdrop. The tracking light's coming on.
093:04:17 Scott (onboard): Okay.
093:04:24 Schweickart (onboard): Yes. Wow! Yes, it sure is.
093:04:29 Scott (onboard): Yes, right between the eyes.
093:04:31 McDivitt (onboard): You know, I don't think I'd been able to track you on my COAS. It's not bright enough.
093:04:35 Schweickart (onboard): You can probably get it close, Jim.
093:04:48 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
093:04:57 Schweickart (onboard): Okay.
093:05:18 McDivitt (onboard): Yes, the camera's off.
093:05:25 Schweickart (onboard): I'm standing by with a VERB 41, NOUN 72, as soon as I - get the flashing - Okay, there we go.
093:05:37 Scott (onboard): Okay, I got the big [garble].
093:05:40 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, Gum.
093:05:48 Schweickart (onboard): And I'm all ready - to the camera. Okay, stand by. I'll be I second.
093:06:01 Scott (onboard): Okay.
093:06:14 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, you ready?
093:06:15 Scott (onboard): It's ready.
093:06:16 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, here it goes.
093:06:26 Schweickart (onboard): And there it is. Stand by. We haven't got the NO TRACK light out yet, but it's blocked off. Okay, the NO TRACK light is out [garble]. Hey, [garble] we call a VERB 83 [garble] ENTER. Okay, it says he's a - 1200 feet.
093:07:07 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, the radar is a GO. Wait a minute, that's - that's going to change again.
093:08:31 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, Gumdrop, [garble].
093:08:35 Scott (onboard): Right. Go.
093:08:36 Schweickart (onboard): Gumdrop, you're - we're done with the radar check.
093:08:40 Scott (onboard): Gee, that's pretty good. Fine.
093:08:44 McDivitt (onboard): Now we're going to put our EXTERIOR LIGHT to DOCK and get ready for the alignment.
093:08:50 Scott (onboard): Roger.
093:12:39 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Rusty, let me - get this off of here, it's sort of in the way.
093:12:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. I'm - I'm going to take it - Okay, go ahead.
093:12:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. We're ready for the maneuver, ready?
093:12:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, go.
093:12:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, here goes the maneuver. Gee. Great Scott! Okay, the ERROR needles are coming in, not yet, almost. 3, 2, 1.
093:13:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
093:13:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): How's that for a shock?
093:13:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, my goodness. Wonder what happened?
093:13:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): What?
093:13:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I saw it coming right on down and then -
093:13:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, you're - you're clear to MARK on either.
093:13:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You could see it?
093:13:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I could but, it's just, it's disappearing out there - what's ...
This is Apollo Control 93 hours 14 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 9 is now over the Indian Ocean, coming on the time for the separation maneuver. There not be a change of shift briefing this morning for the Orange Team because of the intense amount of activity in this rendezvous sequence. Flight Director Pete Frank prefers to stay here in the Control Center to follow through on the activities begun during his shift, when the crew was awakened about an hour earlier than had been scheduled before, so that they could continue - or pick up the LM manning and power up. This took place about 85 hours 40 minutes ground elapsed time when the crew awakened. Actually, Scott was awake when they came over the hill at the Guam tracking station. During the subsequent pass over Ascension Island, the crew made a medical information report on how they felt, how many pills they had taken, and so on, and also, how well they were eating, and their sleep report.
093:14:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Is the radar in the way?
093:14:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I don't know; I can't tell. There, I can see it now.
093:14:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Maybe it's exit pupil. It may be moving in and out of it.
093:14:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you're clear to mark on either. You think you can mark on it now?
093:14:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'm clear to mark either?
093:14:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:14:36 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, which way do you want it?
093:14:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh boy, that reticle is terrible, too.
093:14:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Up, 2, DOWN. Whoooo, stop, to LEFT/RIGHT.
093:14:50 Scott (Spider onboard): It's not moving.
093:14:52 Scott (onboard): Hello, Spider; Gumdrop. I've got my alignment, and third star check on two bright stars.
They began the transfer to the lunar module at approximately 87 hours 40 minutes. The decision had been made earlier not to donn helmets and gloves or use the CSM umbilicals to transfer to the lunar module. During their subsequent pass over Ascension, the next revolution, there was considerably worse communications than had been encountered over that station earlier and most of it was pretty much unreadable. At just before 89 hours ground elapsed time over the tracking ship Huntsville, the lunar module pilot had some trouble with his intercom microphone. The push to talk control had failed, apparently, and he had to talk in the voice actuated or VOX mode. Later, this was cleared up. The transfer of power to from the CSM umbilical power to the lunar module power took place about an hour earlier than scheduled, which would have made that at about 88:20 ground elapsed time.
093:14:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, give me about 2 UP.
093:14:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 2 UP.
093:15:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): And about 2 LEFT. I got a Y - I got an X in there, didn't I? 1 RIGHT.
093:15:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, you're clear to mark ...
093:15:08 Scott (Spider onboard): 1 RIGHT and stop ...
093:15:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 1 RIGHT and stop the UP/DOWN.
093:15:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You're clear to mark Y.
093:15:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, marking Y.
093:15:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you're clear to mark either.
093:15:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Well, give me 1 RIGHT.
093:15:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1 RIGHT.
093:15:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Clear to mark X. Okay, give me about 2 DOWN.
093:15:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 2 DOWN.
093:15:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay; 1 UP.
093:15:34 Scott (Spider onboard): 1 UP.
093:15:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Looks like one's going to do it.
093:15:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:15:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CLEAR to mark X.
093:15:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:15:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CLEAR to mark either.
093:15:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Give me about 1 UP.
093:15:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1 UP.
093:15:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Looks like another 1?
093:15:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, 1 more UP.
093:15:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1 more UP.
093:16:00 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, we're in the middle of ours, Gumdrop. We'll be right with you.
093:16:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, about 1 LEFT.
093:16:05 Scott (onboard): Okay.
The crew continued the extensive checklists of powering up the lunar module, aligning the IMU, the RCS cold fire, and at 91 hours 5 minutes, as they came across the lower end of the eastern test range, the gimbal drive for the descent propulsion engine was checked out and also the throttle checks were run. The reaction control thrusters were fired hot, brief blips of the engine. During the pass over the tracking station at Honeysuckle, Australia, they were given the maneuver information for the phasing maneuver and over Mercury, just after that, they were given a GO for undocking over the States. The undocking took place at 92 hours 39 minutes 30 seconds. The lunar module maneuvered out in front of the command module for a sequence of photographs, both still and motion picture. It's rotating around in sort of a pirouette for the photography sequence.
093:16:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CLEAR to mark Y. This is the third set.
093:16:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I can take five; I'm going to take all five.
093:16:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right.
093:16:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, CLEAR to mark either.
093:16:28 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, give me one RIGHT.
093:16:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1 RIGHT.
093:16:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): How about stopping the UP/DOWN?
093:16:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, give me about 2 DOWN.
093:16:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 2 DOWN.
093:16:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That was the fourth set, wasn't it?
093:16:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:16:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'm going to mark X, right?
093:16:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right.
093:16:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 1 UP.
093:16:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1 UP.
093:16:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, now ...
093:16:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CLEAR to mark either.
093:16:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 1 UP.
093:16:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1 UP. How about stopping the LEFT/RIGHT?
093:17:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:17:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:17:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Another UP.
093:17:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Another UP.
093:17:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Another UP.
093:17:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, CLEAR to mark Y.
093:17:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): This is almost as hard to use as the simulator.
093:17:34 Scott (Spider onboard): Is it coming?
093:17:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's coming.
093:17:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Stop the UP/DOWN ...
093:17:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:17:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's the last mark. To hell with it.
093:17:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:17:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:17:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): See it move back a minute?
093:17:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let me look at something just a minute here.
093:18:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, here comes the Acrux now.
093:18:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Ready?
093:18:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Ready, GO. AUTO MANEUVER. GO.
093:18:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble].
093:18:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:18:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Could you tell that was Sirius?
093:18:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, it's definitely Sirius.
093:18:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Gee, you could identify all this - It's not even dark yet. Boy, there's the Gumdrop.
093:18:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's Canopus over there.
093:18:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:18:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): There's a whole mass -
093:18:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Boy, it looks just like the simulator in the ball. Man, it is coming right down the same way.
093:18:42 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble] to do.
093:18:43 Scott (onboard): Okay, a ... has you within 1 degree.
The separation burn by the command module had been scheduled for 93 hours 2 minutes 53 seconds, which would have been out of acquisition. This was approximately 16 minutes ago. We will learn how it went as we come up on the Carnarvon station with acquisition at 22 minutes past the hour. That in effect, summarizes the past 8 hours of the activity here in the Mission Control Center. The handover is taking place between the Orange Team and the White Team of flight controllers, headed up by Gene F. Kranz. At 93 hours 19 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
093:18:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Roger, great. This AOT is really not a very good optical instrument, I tell you. Hey, there's Acrux. Whoooo, pretty close!
093:18:46 Schweickart (onboard): Man, that'll be great.
093:18:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay - okay, you're CLEAR to mark either.
093:19:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Can you pull that right - right window shade up, Rusty?
093:19:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, right window shade coming up. Stand by and let me see if I can get that up there. Okay.
093:19:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, let's turn down some lights. My God, we never even turned off any lights.
093:19:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh.
093:19:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That help any? Let me get ...
093:19:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, that helps a lot.
093:19:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Here, let me get up some for you.
093:19:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, listen. What you've got in there right now is good.
093:19:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You should have to pitch up a good bit.
093:19:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, oh yes, pitch up and ...
093:19:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, it's ...
093:19:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Under the right too.
093:19:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I got the one at the right end.
093:19:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, pitching back down. Okay, how's that?
093:19:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You're too close. 1 more to the RIGHT.
093:19:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1 more RIGHT.
093:19:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): And just let it drop down.
093:19:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:20:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's going to be in X.
093:20:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:20:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Stop the LEFT/RIGHT, or not?
093:20:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Stop the LEFT/RIGHT.
093:20:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. Okay.
093:20:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 1 more UP.
093:20:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:20:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, we're way over control. And I glad we don't have to do one with an ascent only!
093:20:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, we still need UP RIGHT.
093:20:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, one more UP.
093:20:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): There - there it goes.
093:20:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Boy, oh boy, everything is so bright in here.
093:20:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, CLEAR to mark Y.
093:20:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Want to turn down your lights before you do that, or not?
093:20:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): If you want to reach over there.
093:20:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I can't reach them.
093:20:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I don't want to mess with them, yet.
093:20:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. CLEAR, to mark Y.
093:20:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Give me 1 to the RIGHT, LEFT.
093:20:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. 1 DOWN?
093:20:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No. Stop - yes, stop to dial -
093:21:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, yes, right.
093:21:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I wanted to get down a little bit farther there - You can't get the -
093:21:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 1 more RIGHT.
093:21:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): RIGHT or LEFT.
093:21:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): LEFT, I mean.
093:21:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Never mind. Just leave it like it is now.
093:21:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:21:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, mark either.
093:21:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, give me a - 1 RIGHT.
093:21:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1 RIGHT.
093:21:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 1 UP, too.
093:21:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1 UP, too.
093:21:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, 1 more RIGHT.
093:21:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1 more BIGHT.
093:21:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): How you coming?
093:21:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, just let it go.
This is Apollo Control at 93 hours 22 minutes. We're standing by for acquisition at Carnarvon where we will await confirmation of the separation burn, this burn taking place in the band between Canaries and Carnarvon. Pete Frank and the Orange team have handed over to Flight Director Gene Kranz and the White team. We should be acquiring at Carnarvon very shortly. We'll stand by.
093:22:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. I'd like to kill a roll pulse here.
093:22:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, not yet.
093:22:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:22:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, now you can.
093:22:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:22:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, give me 1 DOWN - What am I marking now?
093:22:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You're marking X.
093:22:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Good. Hey, it's harder than hell to get this star focused and the reticle focused, too. They're not even focused in the same spot. You know, you're looking for the exit pupil of one; doesn't seem to be where the exit pupil of the other is.
093:22:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, CLEAR to mark X.
093:22:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. 1 UP.
093:22:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CLEAR to mark either.
093:22:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 1 on UP.
093:22:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1 on UP.
093:22:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Another 1 UP.
093:22:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Another 1 UP.
093:22:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Boy, this pulse is really nice.
093:22:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, CLEAR to mark Y.
093:22:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, ...
CARNARVON (REV 59)
093:22:59 Roosa: Gumdrop/Spider, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by.
093:23:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1 LEFT.
093:23:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ... okay, 1 LEFT.
093:23:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Which set was that?
093:23:06 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop. Roger.
093:23:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That was about the - I think this was the third.
093:23:08 Roosa: Roger, Gumdrop. Confirm the SEP burn.
093:23:11 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. SEP burn on time. Good burn, and everything's looking good.
093:23:16 Roosa: Thank you. [Long pause]
093:23:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, mark either; that was the third set.
093:23:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Take 1 RIGHT.
093:23:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1 RIGHT.
093:23:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Stop the UP/DOWN.
093:23:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No.
093:23:32 Schweickart (onboard): And Spider's here.
093:23:33 McDivitt (Spider): [Garble]. We finished making Sirius, and we're on the fourth set on Atria.
093:23:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, now ...
093:23:38 Roosa: Roger, Spider. You are loud and clear.
Comm break.
093:23:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, now 1 DOWN. And 1 RIGHT, too.
093:24:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Stop the LEFT/RIGHT?
093:24:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No.
093:24:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, that was the fourth set.
093:24:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, 1 UP.
093:24:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1 UP. CLEAR to mark either. Can I stop that LEFT/RIGHT, yet?
093:24:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:24:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:24:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You need that one more right now.
093:24:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:24:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CLEAR to mark Y.
093:24:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, just let it go.
093:24:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:24:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Let me get one roll pulse here.
093:24:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, just - just delay.
093:24:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:24:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Ready?
093:24:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Ready.
093:24:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh my aching back!
093:24:55 Schweickart (Spider): Would you believe five zeros?
093:24:56 Scott (Gumdrop): Beautiful.
093:24:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): (Laughter)
093:24:58 Roosa: Roger, Spider. [Long pause]
That's 5 zeros that Rusty Schweickart had reference -
093:25:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): (Laughter) McDivitt!
093:25:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, let's do the next one.
093:25:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:25:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We're way - okay, stand by here. We've got to get the COAS going. Okay, let me get - copy them down here.
093:25:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I can see Gumdrop down there.
093:25:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 93 is minus 0.090 ...
093:25:30 Roosa: That looks mighty pretty, Spider.
093:25:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... minus 0.076 ...
093:25:34 Schweickart (Spider): Thank you. [Long pause]
He's referring to the readout on his platform alignment, all zeros.
093:25:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Plus 0.111. Boy, that docked alignment turned out good, didn't it? Holy smokes! Ready to gyro torque?
093:25:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Ready, babe.
093:25:42 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, there they go.
093:25:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. PROCEED, ENTER.
093:25:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you ready for your COAS?
093:25:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Go.
093:25:54 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, 2's - 526. I want to do VERB 21, ENTER; 526, ENTER. Okay, PRO, VERB 22, ENTER; plus all zeros - that darn.
093:26:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Regulus should be way over there.
093:26:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you ready? Here we go.
093:26:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, not Regulus now. This is not Regulus.
093:26:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's right; that's the other one.
093:26:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Spica.
093:26:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Spica, oh shoot, we're not going to be able to see Spica.
093:26:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, we will when we pass the horizon.
093:26:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No [garble] the Moon's going to be in the way.
093:26:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh.
093:26:30 Scott (Gumdrop): Spider, Gumdrop. I can see your jets firing just as clear as a bell.
093:26:35 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. I was watching your light down there.
093:26:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Stop right there.
093:26:38 Scott (Gumdrop): You just gave a big burst, didn't you?
093:26:40 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. [Pause]
093:26:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, there's a star out there, and it's right next to the Moon. And that's where Spica ought to be.
093:26:44 Scott (Gumdrop): It just lights up the whole sky. [Pause]
093:26:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Can - okay, now stand by and let me - zero some things for you.
093:26:52 Scott (Spider onboard): Here, let me -
093:26:53 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston. Did you do a P52 there?
093:26:57 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. And stand by, and I'll give you the angles.
093:26:59 Roosa: Roger [Pause]
093:27:05 Scott (Gumdrop): It will be about 5 minutes.
093:27:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It's right on in yaw, and it's right on in pitch now.
093:27:07 Roosa: Okay.
Comm break.
093:27:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, it's a half of a degree out in yaw, right out in pitch.
093:27:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. PROCEED, PROCEED; PROCEED. Okay, now let me just check my - where I am here. Okay, the time now is 93:27:30. Okay, and - we've got the position of the star - we're there. Okay, we want to do a VERB 34. Okay, VERB 34, ENTER. Okay, and you can to CB(11), AC BUS B, AOT LAMP, OPEN.
093:28:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's open. Close [garble].
093:28:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:28:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Come on, baby. Okay, I'm updating and aligning the AGS, and we're 6 minutes up. We've never been here before.
093:28:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:28:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 5 zeros. McDivitt, you're fantastic!
093:28:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'll take that beer.
093:28:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:28:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Where are - where are we?
093:28:50 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, tape is coming off.
093:28:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Where - where are we, Rusty?
093:28:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We're at - no, I'm going to leave the tape on. Excuse me. We're at rendezvous - We're at minus 13 minutes on phasing. We're coming up on phasing 16.
093:29:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): And you're updating the AGS, okay?
093:29:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right. 8 feet per second free spectrum, and we're 0.14 - 1.6 miles away.
093:29:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right.
093:29:19 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, here goes the alignment on the AGS. Nicely. Okay.
093:29:26 Roosa: Okay. Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston. And I'll lose you at Carnarvon in about a minute; and bring up your S-band volumes about that time. We'll have you at Honeysuckle.
093:29:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We'll proceed now.
093:29:37 McDivitt (Spider): Okay.
093:29:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, CB (11), AC BUS A, RENDEZVOUS RADAR, CLOSE. You got that?
093:29:40 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop.
Comm break.
093:29:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, RENDEZVOUS RADAR CLOSED.
093:29:42 Schweickart/McDivitt: Okay, - that's in ...
093:29:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, that's in 30 seconds.
093:29:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, shouldn't we make an AUTO maneuver here?
093:29:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right.
093:29:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): The VERB 89, ENTER. And you want the Z-axis, so it's a plus 1, and it's a PRO. And there's going to be the roll pitch and yaw. And a PRO. Okay, ready to maneuver?
093:30:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'm ready.
093:30:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. PRO. Boy, it really goes off with a bang, doesn't it?
093:30:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Keep an eye on that propellant.
093:30:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:30:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you got the time up, yet?
093:30:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 42 - not quite, yes. It is. So we're missing him.
093:30:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, that's okay. I wouldn't sweat that one. PRO. Okay, RENDEZVOUS PADAR to SLEW, you want to track the CSM with the COAS, and you are in PULSE. Okay, and you got a roll - 25 degrees to the left.
093:31:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, let me get up there to them.
093:31:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, want me to turn some lights down for you?
093:31:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, I can see them fine. Surely they got a good light out there. Getting close, anyway.
093:31:19 Scott (Spider onboard): I don't see it. Where is he?
093:31:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): He's right at - he's right down the Z-axis about a half - No - oh, he just fired a bunch -
093:31:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, hell, I got my window shade up. No wonder I can't see.
093:31:35 Scott (onboard): Spider, Gumdrop. I've got you at 1.78 miles and 4.8 feet per second.
093:31:40 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
093:31:47 McDivitt (Spider): Are you firing a lot up there?
093:31:49 Scott (Gumdrop): Yes. I'm just - Yes. Roger.
093:31:51 Scott (Spider onboard): Yes, just spurts. Yes, look.
093:31:53 McDivitt (Spider): That's going to put your light out. I can't even see it.
093:31:56 Scott (Gumdrop): Just pulsing. [Pause]
093:32:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I don't care what it is; it'll put your light out, man!
093:32:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we're on him right now.
093:32:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, you want to lock your RADAR, ON?
HONEYSUCKLE (REV 59)
093:32:10 Roosa: Okay. Spider/Gumdrop, Houston. We've got you through Honeysuckle now. [Pause]
093:32:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Go to SLEW, don't we, here?
093:32:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Stand by.
093:32:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, don't we want to go to SLEW?
093:32:20 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop monitors. Spider, do you have your light on?
093:32:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh shoot! Yes, now.
093:32:26 Schweickart (Spider): On the cab. [Pause]
093:32:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Slew it to zero for me will you, Rusty?
093:32:32 Roosa: And, Spider, when you've got a moment, I want to pass on a little bit of info.
093:32:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:32:39 Schweickart (Spider): Say you want to pass, Houston?
093:32:41 Roosa: Roger. I want to update your red lines on the DPS: your oxidizer to fuel...
093:32:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Are you ready?
093:32:51 Roosa: ...red line is...
093:32:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Go.
093:32:53 Roosa: ...25 - 25 versus the 12 as shown on your checklist. [Pause]
093:33:00 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Understand 25 percent on the red line for oxidizer.
093:33:05 Roosa: No. It's a DELTA-P of 25 psi oxidizer to fuel. [Pause]
093:33:13 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. 25 DELTA-P oxidizer to fuel.
093:33:17 Roosa: Roger. On the DPS
093:33:18 Schweickart (Spider): [Garble] the line.
093:33:19 Roosa: That's affirmative.
093:33:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, we're locked on. Good, solid.
093:33:23 Roosa: In other words, they are both 25 now.
093:33:29 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. Got you. [Pause]
093:33:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, let me see where we are, now. Okay, VERB 70, VERB 89, okay. RENDEZVOUS RADAR? Okay, RENDEZVOUS RADAR to AUTO TRACK. Okay. You've got it there. Main load lock ON; you want to verify that.
093:33:33 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, Gumdrop. I can give you those angles now.
093:33:35 Roosa: Go ahead.
093:33:37 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. GET at 93:14:00, plus 00117, plus 00035, minus 00109. [Pause]
093:33:43 Scott (Spider onboard): I have.
093:33:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Here comes a VERB 83.
093:33:45 Scott (Spider onboard): Plus 00035, minus 00109.
093:33:53 Roosa: Roger. Copy. Thank you, Gumdrop.
093:33:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Did you get the landing radar breaker closed too, Jim?
093:33:56 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. [Long pause]
093:33:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, I didn't.
093:33:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. You want to get that one?
093:34:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You know he actually - he puts out his light when he fires this stuff.
093:34:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, doesn't he? He puts out a whole cloud.
093:34:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Fantastic.
093:34:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, you want to adjust the ORDEAL here.
093:34:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 353. Right on the money.
093:34:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, it's doing all right now.
093:34:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. You don't want to adjust it?
093:34:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, it's all right.
093:34:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. We've got about 8 feet per second and 2.225 ...
093:34:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Why - why don't you leave it there until I get right side up ...
093:34:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Let's see how we score on that.
093:34:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. That's a little bit off now.
093:34:31 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston. You GO for phasing.
093:34:35 McDivitt (Spider): Roger, Houston. Understand we are GO for phasing.
093:34:37 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop copies. [Pause]
093:34:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we're going to have a few updates, Jim; it looks like we've got a little bit different here.
093:34:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:34:47 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, you might anticipate a MASTER ALARM on your H2 tank pressure.
093:34:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. When we are going to P20?
093:34:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Go ahead.
093:34:52 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. [Long pause]
093:34:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, we are not going into P20 now, Jim; we're ...
093:34:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, yes, no. Not when I was really - I was just acknowledging the fact that - when we go there, we're going to get a ...
093:35:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. Okay.
093:35:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Probably an update.
093:35:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. We're going to bypass the maneuver.
093:35:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Boy, I wish I had some rate needles I could use.
093:35:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Enter on that - Okay. We've got 12 minutes until the burn, and we're up to about - Hell, we're about 12 minutes. What do you know!
093:35:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:35:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): All of a sudden we're back on the time line.
093:35:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. NOUN 86, ENTER. Okay. Let me copy those down. Plus 1.2, minus all zips, and minus 90.7 - Okay, but I'm going to use the pad anyway. Okay. I'll do a KEY RELEASE.
093:35:46 Scott (Gumdrop): Spider, Gumdrop.
093:35:47 Schweickart (Spider): Go ahead.
093:35:48 Scott (Gumdrop): May I have this cross in link?
093:35:53 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. [Pause]
093:35:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Man.
093:36:00 McDivitt (Spider): When your thrusters fire, it just puts out a great big orange cloud I can see way back here.
093:36:04 Scott (Gumdrop): Yes. Yours too. [Long pause]
093:36:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Now I need that pad, okay, I got it.
093:36:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Looks like somehow or other, we're out of plane, too.
093:36:26 Schweickart (Spider): Boy, I sure could use those 1 degree-per-second rate needles, or at least some rate needles that were accurate. [Long pause]
093:36:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:36:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We are alright there.
093:36:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Gumdrop, did you ever pick up my light again?
093:36:53 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop. We are going to lose you at Honeysuckle in - within a minute, and we'll see you over the Mercury at 43.
093:37:01 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. [Pause]
This is Apollo Control. We have had LOS at Honeysuckle. Mercury will acquire in about 4 minutes. During this Australian pass Dave Scott confirmed a good, ontime separation maneuver by Gumdrop. The relative motion of the two vehicles, Gumdrop and Spider, is now in the equal period, small equal peiod orbit known as the mini football. About midway through the Mercury pass, Spider will perform the phasing maneuver, which puts them into the football proper. The Descent Propulsion System burn, under the AGS, or Abort Guidance System Control, this is the backup guidance system to the primary, and this is the only burn during this series of maneuvers in which AGS is the prime control mode during the burn. We're now about 2 minutes away from Mercury, we'll come back up at acquisition there.
093:37:02 Scott (Spider onboard): Roger.
093:37:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:37:05 McDivitt (Spider): Gumdrop, cut your lights down.
Long comm break.
093:37:06 Scott (Spider onboard): I've got your light [garble].
093:37:08 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
093:37:10 McDivitt (onboard): I have it showing about a degree or so out of plane, already.
093:37:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's not too surprising.
093:37:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What?
093:37:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): At this close range, Jim, that's not a surprise, I guess.
093:37:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, I really didn't expect it. It surprises me.
093:37:25 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, I do too.
093:37:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, at 10 minutes to go: Okay.
093:37:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Did you get to VERB 78, ENTER?
093:37:43 Scott (onboard): I have us about 7 minutes late on the crossing, and I don't know why.
093:37:46 McDivitt (onboard): You gave us what?
093:37:47 Scott (onboard): About 7 minutes late for the horizontal crossing.
093:37:49 McDivitt (onboard): Oh, really?
093:37:50 Scott (onboard): Yes. I don't understand it, Rusty.
093:37:54 McDivitt (onboard): Gee, we're just about crossed right now. We're look - we're going to be looking up at you, I think, here, if I pitched all the way around [garble].
093:38:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, I don't mean that.
093:38:04 Scott (onboard): Oh, my ORDEAL slewed good.
093:38:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Boy, we're right on 286 in the pitch, Jim.
093:38:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:38:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Did - did you get VERB 78 in?
093:38:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'll get it when I do ...
093:38:15 Scott (onboard): No, I better wait until you clear the [garble].
093:38:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I got it. VERB 78, ENTER. Okay.
093:38:18 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
093:38:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Let me see where we are now. Okay. We got the cumulative DFI POWER, ON.
093:38:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): DFI POWER, ON.
093:38:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): PRPLNT QUANTITY MONITOR, DESCENT 1 and 2.
093:38:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): PRPLNT QUANTITY, DESCENT 1; DESCENT 2.
093:38:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Standing by for 6 minutes. Okay. Here we go: if no DPS ignition, or premature shutdown, do not restart. Okay. Okay, it says, "Null only Y and D residuals.
093:38:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:38:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): If the X residual is less than 20 feet per second, perform insertion as planned. If the X residuals are greater than 20 feet per second, eventually do not - do NCC NSR.
093:39:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:39:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Do not stage. Terminate burn, if the attitudes are greater than 10 degrees, attitude errors greater than 10 degrees, rates greater than 5 degress per second, 3 second overburn or equivalent.
093:39:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Do you know the burn time on this? We don't even have it.
093:39:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, we don't ever have a burn time.
093:39:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Standing by for 6 minutes. So let me just check all the RCS and everything.
093:39:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. What do we do here? We slip throttle profile. It's all ...
093:39:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And throttle up to 40 at 5 seconds.
093:39:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): To 40 percent. We'll just stay there.
093:39:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Okay. That's 25. Okay. Do we have a DELTA-P of 25 in the DPS between oxidizer and fuel.
093:40:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Now, whoa, whoa, tight.
093:40:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. We're looking like about ...
093:40:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Its 12.
093:40:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 12, yes. Okay. So we're ...
093:40:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We got ULL limit, wasn't it?
093:40:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): (Laughter) Yes. As a matter of fact, OX HIGH, too. I guess that's why they gave it to us.
093:40:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. In 6 minutes, we're going to do the inverters. Then we're going to go to PULSE, and you're going to gun control the AGS, and fly the AGS errors to zero.
093:40:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): McDivitt, I can't believe that alignment.
093:40:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): (Laughter) Neigher can I. Don't tell anybody though.
093:40:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Gee.
093:40:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): There's the one spot on this floor I need a hunk of Velcro I don't have one.
093:40:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. 407 seems to be holding right now, for some reason.
093:41:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. All right, let's start this thing a little early the first time through it here.
093:41:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSED.
093:41:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): INVERTER 1, CLOSED.
093:41:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. I'm going to INVERTER 1. Okay. We're on INVERTER 1.
093:41:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we didn't glitch anything. Cross tie balance loads coming OPEN. But let me tell you what your BUS does. It dropped to 29 - 29.4.
093:41:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What's - what's the other one.
093:41:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Just a little above that; 30 something.
093:41:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's okay.
093:41:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay?
093:41:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:41:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we got that done. ATTITUDE CONTROL to PULSE; MODE CONTROL to AUTO.
093:41:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MODE CONTROL to AUTO.
093:41:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, GUIDANCE CONTROL to AGS.
093:41:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): GUIDANCE CONTROL to AGS.
093:41:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Fly the AGS nearest to zero.
093:41:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oops! Hold on.
093:41:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Come on.
093:42:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, flying to zero.
093:42:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Woop. Remember, you're not going to be pointing that at them when you do that.
093:42:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I realize that.
093:42:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:42:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I haven't been [garble] anyway. Let's see, when I get there, I can just put these things to MODE CONTROL, and yaw looks like it's in pretty good ...
093:42:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, you don't really want to ...
093:42:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): But you don't want to do that too early, here.
093:42:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No. It'll eat up an awful lot of fuel. That PULSE isn't too bad, because you can feel it; you know it?
093:42:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:42:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It turns out it works all right.
093:42:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, stand by for the 4 minute check. The two clocks are right together.
093:42:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:42:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, PGNS says, they're pegged at 5, that's right.
093:42:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Get up there faster. Okay, we're already to zero range rate.
093:43:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:43:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Where are we? We're 16000 up, no 14.
This is Apollo Control at 93 hours 42 minutes. Coming up on the Mercury now end the phasing maneuver is 4 minutes 33 seconds away.
093:43:22 McDivitt (onboard): Dave, it looks like we're having horizontal crossing right about now.
MERCURY (REV 59)
093:43:23 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston through the Mercury. Standing by for your burn.
093:43:25 Scott (Spider onboard): Standing by for your burn.
093:43:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, no we're not. No, he's not on our Z axis, Jim.
093:43:29 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Stand by.
093:43:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, but the range rate is going to zero. We're not up.
093:43:33 Roosa: And I'm reading you. [Pause]
093:43:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:43:39 Schweickart (Spider): Roger, Houston. This is Spider. How do you read?
093:43:41 Roosa: I'm reading you loud and clear, Spider.
093:43:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. 4-minute check. ENGINE GIMBAL, OFF.
093:43:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ENGINE GIMBAL, OFF.
093:43:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ATTITUDE CONTROL 3 to MODE CONTROL.
093:43:48 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. I'm right with you on horizontal crossing.
093:43:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:43:53 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay.
Comm break.
093:43:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you want to call them?
093:43:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, let me get them in there.
093:43:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Looks good, come on roll.
093:44:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, hustle up there. We got a lot to do here.
093:44:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, get going with the checklist.
093:44:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, TTCA, THROTTLE, UP, and MINIMUM throttle. THRUST CONTROL TO MANUAL.
093:44:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): THROTTLE, UP, MINIMUM; THRUST CONTROL to MANUAL.
093:44:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, MANUAL THROTTLE to COMMANDER.
093:44:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MANUAL THROTTLE to COMMANDER.
093:44:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Verify MODE CONTROL, AUTO.
093:44:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MODE CONTROL in AUTO.
093:44:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ENGINE ARM to DESCENT.
093:44:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ENGINE ARM to DESCENT.
093:44:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): X-TRANSLATION, 2 JET.
093:44:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 2 JET.
093:44:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): BAL COUPLES, ON.
093:44:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): BAL COUPLES, ON.
093:44:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, ABORT PRESS, to ON.
093:45:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ABORT PRESS, to ON. You got your stop -
093:45:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I got it. Okay, verify DPS and APS, temperatures, and pressures. We got 28 seconds to the 2 minute.
DPS is armed. The descent propulsion system is armed and Control says he is at the low throttle point. Two minutes 20 seconds away from the burn.
093:45:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): They look good.
093:45:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. How's that PGNS error look?
093:45:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 4 degrees. SUPERCRIT pressures back up again. Can't be anywhere there except ambient.
093:45:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, stand by for 2 minutes.
093:45:29 McDivitt (Spider): It will be 2 minutes on Mark, Gumdrop. [Pause]
093:45:30 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:45:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, gees, I got to get my gloves on.
093:45:36 McDivitt (Spider): MARK.
093:45:37 Scott (Gumdrop): Right with you.
Comm break.
093:45:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Verify burn attitude compare PGNCS and AGS attitude errors. Let's see; PGNCS, okay. AGS and DEADBAND. Okay. Okay.
093:45:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, in 8 seconds we're going to start ULLAGE.
093:45:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, why don't you read here, and I'll just ...
093:45:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. We have the 2 minute mark thing done, verified to BURN ATTITUDE.
093:46:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Wait, I'm still ...
093:46:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Take your AGS, ATTITUDE ERRORS.
093:46:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I'm still watching 407, too, cause I don't want that damn thing to change.
093:46:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. So you got all this other stuff up here, yet. Okay, at 8 seconds, you do plus-X ULLAGE.
093:46:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right.
093:46:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): At 5 seconds, you hit the ENTER.
093:46:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): At 5 seconds I turn the ENGINE GIMBAL to ENABLE.
093:46:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Alright.
093:46:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. 55 I throttle up to 40 percent.
093:46:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Go ahead.
093:46:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, ENGINE OFF. I'll go GUIDANCE CONTROL to PGNS; ABORT PRESS to RESET; ENGINE ARM, OFF; TTCA comes up.
093:46:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, and I'll be copying down the residuals.
093:46:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, and then you PRO.
093:46:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): - and burn the -
093:46:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): - and burn the residuals off.
093:46:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right.
45 seconds.
093:46:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'm going to go ahead and forget about 407, here.
093:46:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:47:00 McDivitt (Spider): 35 seconds, Gumdrop.
093:47:03 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. [Long pause]
093:47:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): If we get out of control, I'll shut it OFF. Our stop button's uncovered.
093:47:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. You got to go to ENGINE GIMBAL ENABLE right?
093:47:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right.
093:47:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:47:26 McDivitt (Spider): 10 seconds. [Pause]
093:47:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 8 ULLAGE, ON.
093:47:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:47:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, and ENTER.
093:47:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ENGINE GIMBAL, ENABLE.
093:47:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Light - there it is.
093:47:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, ULLAGE, OFF.
093:47:39 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:47:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 71 feet per second remaining.
093:47:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Little rough there.
093:47:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, wasn't it. I think it swallowed a little helium. Okay, they're both counting down together.
Burning at 40 percent. It looks good.
093:47:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Together, okay.
093:47:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, ENGINE, OFF.
093:47:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Shutdown. Okay controls are off.
093:47:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. 0.9 minus 10 - minus 1.
Engine off.
093:48:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): GUIDANCE CONTROL to PGNS
093:48:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): In PGNS, okay.
093:48:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ABORT PRESS to RESET. ENGINE ARM, OFF. TTCA COMMAND to JET. Oh, look at that. That's good. It's a good burn, Gumdrop.
093:48:13 McDivitt (Spider): It was a good burn, Gumdrop.
093:48:15 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Good.
093:48:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Got a little rough there when we throttled up.
093:48:18 McDivitt (Spider): It got a little rough there when we throttled up.
093:48:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Gees, it's a hell of a translation.
093:48:21 Scott (Gumdrop): Well, you didn't have the Gumdrop with you. [Long pause]
093:48:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Holy Christmas!
093:48:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:48:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Look's good.
093:48:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:48:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, PROCEED. Stand by here.
093:48:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I want to do VERB 79, ENTER. You want do a CAL.
093:48:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We want to - we want - Yes.
093:48:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ENTER.
093:48:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Fixing the CAL coming on.
093:48:55 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, the CAL coming on?
093:48:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Zero zero, ENTER.
093:48:59 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, Spider.
093:49:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ENTER.
093:49:03 Roosa: Go, Spider, Houston.
093:49:05 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. The burn was a good one, and we are giving you CAL.
093:49:08 Roosa: Roger. Thank you.
093:49:11 McDivitt (Spider): At 500, 501, and 502, after trimming the PGNCS, we are reading 00 and minus 1.
093:49:18 Roosa: Roger. Good work. [Pause]
093:49:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, did you get VERB 79 in?
093:49:25 Schweickart (Spider): [Garble] Yes, I did. Landing radar open.
093:49:26 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Long pause]
093:49:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. LANDING RADAR, 0PEN.
093:49:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): RATE ERR MONITOR to RENDEZVOUS RADAR, THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO. PRPLNT QUANTITY MONITOR, OFF. Okay.
093:49:40 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
093:49:44 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Engine gimbal to ENABLE.
093:49:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's...
093:49:46 McDivitt (onboard): [Garble] ENABLE.
093:49:47 Scott (Gumdrop): [Garble] to ENABLE. Stand by.
093:49:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): INVERTER to 2.
093:49:49 Schweickart (onboard): Am I?
093:49:52 Roosa: Everything looks good here. Spider. It was a good burn.
093:49:55 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. It was a little rough. It got a little rough and chuggy around 20 percent as I was throttling up. I waited for it and then throttled up...
093:50:02 Schweickart (onboard): INVERNER 1, OPEN.
093:50:03 McDivitt (Spider): [Garble] throttle 1 OPEN.
093:50:04 Scott (Gumdrop): [Garble] 1 OPEN.
093:50:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You got INVERTER2, ON?
093:50:05 McDivitt (onboard): Check.
093:50:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, INVERTER 1 coming OPEN.
093:50:07 Roosa: Roger. We're losing you at the Mercury, and we will see you over Texas about 05.
093:50:13 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. And you can debrief the burn.
093:50:14 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Got it?
093:50:15 McDivitt (Spider): Yes.
093:50:16 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Long pause]
093:50:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, as I was - we had a nice slow start again, just like we had previously. However, as I started throttling the thing up, I got up to about 15 or 20 percent, and I started chugging. You could actually feel the rough combustion of the - behind the spacecraft. I held the throttle there, and, I might add, I throttled up quite slowly. I held the throttle there, waited for it to catch up; it did, and I throttled on up to 40 percent, and it followed itself going up.
093:50:40 Schweickart (onboard): You want to pitch -
093:50:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... now and ...
093:50:42 McDivitt (onboard): Yes.
093:50:43 McDivitt (Spider): [Garble] to pitch now on the [garble] I'm going to [garble].
Very long comm break.
093:50:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:50:44 Schweickart (onboard): Okay.
093:50:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Are we in 76 now?
093:50:45 Schweickart (onboard): See, I - I'm going to -
093:50:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Here.
093:50:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Here, very good.
093:50:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): See how bad off we are; we're pretty bad. The shutdown was good. The residuals were practically zero, and Gumdrop is way down below us. There. See him?
093:51:01 McDivitt (onboard): Get that one.
093:51:08 Schweickart (onboard): Yes. See him?
093:51:10 McDivitt (onboard): Yes.
093:51:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, I'm surprised we didn't break LOCK.
093:51:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): He's practically underneath us.
093:51:18 McDivitt (onboard): Hey, we really got to pitch pretty fast on that.
093:51:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:51:21 Schweickart (onboard): Wonder what it looks like from over there?
093:51:26 Scott (onboard): Your broadcast begins.
093:51:28 Schweickart (onboard): Thank you. Hey, keep after us, will you, Davey?
093:51:32 Scott (onboard): Okay.
093:51:36 McDivitt (onboard): Boy, are you down below us!
093:51:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let me make sure I still have him, Rusty. I'm not -
093:51:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, right.
093:51:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No sweat, [garble] 28 000 feet, it's 6 miles, 2.7 [garble] and we got a good radar.
093:52:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Quiet.
093:52:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:52:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, are we still locked down in the pitch part -
093:52:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, we're pit - locked on in yaw, too.
093:52:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, it's good, huh?
093:52:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, good. Okay [garble].
093:52:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Ready for LGC?
093:52:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, yes, LGC. Okay, watch this thing.
This is Apollo Control and Mercury has loss of signal. As you heard, Spider performed that burn very well, just as expected. We had weak signal strength during this pass and we lost data just prior to ignition, got it back after ignition had started, then lost it again a little bit later. This burn started at 10 percent throttle settings and then moved up to 40 percent to complete the burn and it was very successful. So Spider is now in the large football again and equal period orbit to the command module. He will stay in this orbit for 1 and 1/4 earth revolutions. At that time he will perform the insertion maneuver. That maneuver coming approximately 95 hours and 40 minutes. We will be passing a pad up to Spider with a specific time a little later on. This is the maneuver that will put Spider at a constant height above Gumdrop. Because he is higher, he will in effect be going slower and it will cause him to pull away, increase the range from Gumdrop. In the equal period orbit at present, maximum range will be approximately 48 nautical miles. This will come at the horizontal crossing point. The next station to acquire will be Texas at 94 hours and 4 minutes, almost 5 minutes. This is Mission Control Houston at 93 hours 53 minutes.
093:53:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:53:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I know what that was. That was, that thing was not on LGC. I didn't read the LGC first to you.
093:53:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:53:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 5.15 - let me just verify it.
093:53:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's a verify.
093:53:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Boy, that old petrol's really gone down.
093:53:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, now it goes - Okay. Okay, 5.25; 3 degree alarm.
093:53:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
093:53:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No sweat. 3.27.
093:54:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, let's take it.
093:54:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
093:54:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Gee, there's some funny rates there.
093:54:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hmm! What's that? Well, I thought I could get into the - Let me get the TPI zero time here going. Okay, it's 94:57.
093:54:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Is the tape off?
093:55:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Tape coming [garble].
093:56:01 Scott (onboard): Hey, Spider; Gumdrop. I've had about three marks and it's starting to go away.
093:56:05 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, we're getting 3 degree [garble] here, but they're starting to come in.
093:58:59 McDivitt (onboard): Gumdrop, for your info, I can still see you out at 12 miles.
093:59:05 Scott (onboard): Roger; and I can still see you.
093:59:06 McDivitt (onboard): Good.
093:59:07 Scott (onboard): Matter of fact, you're just a great big bright star in there. In the sextant, [garble]. Ooh, I can still see your [garble].
093:59:16 McDivitt (onboard): Is that right?
093:59:17 Scott (onboard): Right.
This is Apollo Control at 94 hours, 04 minutes. We are ready to acquire at Texas. This pass will continue through the Madrid station. Along toward the end of this pass we will be given a GO/NO-GO decision.
TEXAS (REV 60)
094:05:03 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston through Texas. Standing by. [Long pause]
We will be getting a GO/NO-GO decision to go past TPI zero point. TPI zero - Terminal Phase Initiate, and the zero signifying it's in the football phase. There is a point approximately at perigee. In this large football, were if it were necessary, we could perform a Terminal Phase maneuver and return to the Command Module. Nominally everything is going all right. We'll go beyond this point and go up to approximately apogee again to perform the insertion maneuver.
094:05:54 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, Houston through Texas. Standing by.
094:05:57 Schweickart (Spider): Hello, there, Houston through Texas standing by. How are you?
094:06:01 Roosa: Oh, we're doing fine. Looks like you are doing great up there, also.
094:06:04 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Where are we over the ground?
094:06:07 Roosa: Oh, you're just coming into Central America down here.
094:06:12 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. [Pause]
094:06:23 Schweickart (Spider): I'll tell you one thing, this is really an ungainly beast with that big descent stage on it. With the - when you try to thrust laterally.
094:06:31 Roosa: Roger. Copy. [Pause]
094:06:40 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston. Like to verify H2 tank 1 heater is AUTO.
094:06:46 Scott (Gumdrop): That is verified H2 tank 1 heater is AUTO, and I have the cryo light on.
094:06:51 Roosa: Understand.
094:06:54 Scott (Gumdrop): But the fuel cell light is off. [Pause]
094:07:09 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston. We'd like to have H2 tank 2 heater to AUTO.
094:07:15 Scott (Gumdrop): H2 tank 2 heater AUTO, now.
094:07:19 Roosa: Understand. [Long pause]
094:07:37 McDivitt (Spider): Hey, Gumdrop. We'll be having our first solution here in a few seconds.
094:07:45 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay, I've already got mine, and I've got an elevation of 211.49. [Long pause]
094:08:25 Schweickart (Spider): Hey, Dave. We're plotting our relative position to you, and, man, we're right on the nominal.
094:08:30 Scott (Gumdrop): Hey, that's great! [Pause]
094:08:42 Schweickart (Spider): We got it at 26 miles right now, if you are interested. [Pause]
094:08:53 Schweickart (Spider): And we got 30.59 for our first elevation angle solution. [Pause]
094:09:05 McDivitt (Spider): What did you get for yours, Dave?
094:09:06 Scott (Gumdrop): Well, in your language it would be 31.49.
094:09:10 Schweickart (Spider): Oh, I didn't hear - I heard - I thought you said 2114...
094:09:13 Scott (Gumdrop): Wait a minute, 21149.
094:09:15 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Fine.
094:09:16 Scott (Gumdrop): Right now, I have you at 26,27 and 150.4.
094:09:20 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. I've got 26.27, and I'm at 155.5. That's on my radar. It's probably 5 feet off. Matter of fact, it didn't agree with the tape's record by a couple of feet per second.
Long comm break.
TEXAS (REV 60)
094:13:42 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston.
094:13:44 Scott (Gumdrop): This is Gumdrop. Go.
094:13:47 Roosa: Roger. We noticed you're gone to a four-jet roll authority. Unless you're got a good reason, we are recommending Baker Dog roll OFF.
094:13:57 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. I'm running the DAP. [Pause]
094:14:04 Scott (Gumdrop): And you can check the DAP. I'm using [garble] DAP [Pause]
094:14:14 Roosa: Roger, Gumdrop. Copy
094:14:19 Scott (Gumdrop): There's the BD roll OFF.
094:14:22 Roosa: Copy.
Comm break.
094:15:34 Roosa: Spider, Houston.
094:15:35 McDivitt (Spider): Go ahead, Houston. Spider.
094:15:37 Roosa: Roger. We would like to have the DFI OFF at this time, and we would like to have you verify the CO2 sensor circuit breaker on panel 16 is IN [Pause]
094:15:48 McDivitt (Spider): Stand by.
094:15:50 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. It's closed.
094:15:51 Roosa: Roger. Understand it's closed. And if you're got a minute, I want to give you an update on some bias times. [Long pause]
094:16:24 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Houston, Spider. Be with you in just a second.
094:16:28 Roosa: Roger. No sweat. [Long pause]
094:16:49 Scott (Gumdrop): Do you want to watch your radar now? Is it staying the same.
094:16:54 McDivitt (Spider): Go. [Long pause]
094:17:06 Scott (Gumdrop): No, I didn't need it. [Long pause]
094:17:21 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Go ahead, Houston.
094:17:23 Roosa: Roger. This is an update in your P32 program. The TPI bias has changed from 3 minutes to 4 minutes. We want you to add 4 minutes on the TPI bias in your CSI P32 program. [Pause]
094:17:48 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. The CDH bias still 1 plus 45.
094:17:51 Roosa: That is affirmative. The CDH bias is 1 plus 45. We are only changing the TPI bias.
094:17:59 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. [Long pause]
Range is 40 miles now.
094:18:18 Schweickart (Spider): Gumdrop, did you get that?
094:18:22 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. I copied.
094:18:23 Schweickart (Spider): Good time for procedure changes, isn't it?
094:18:26 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger.
094:18:27 Roosa: Spider? Spider, Houston.
094:18:32 Schweickart (Spider): Go ahead.
094:18:34 Roosa: Roger. I - As you've probably figured out, this is due to the change in the orbit. We've got a little more eccentricity than we planned on.
094:18:43 Roosa: And we are showing your orbit as 122 by 127.
094:18:47 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
Comm break.
Coming up on 42 mile range.
Range rate, 124 feet per second.
094:20:23 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, Houston. I have a TPI0 PAD.
094:20:29 Schweickart (Spider): Spider ready.
094:20:30 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop's ready. [Pause]
094:20:37 Roosa: Roger. Reading TPI0: 094 57 5300, minus 202, plus 004, minus 015 203 N slash A N slash A 3090, minus 1511, aft l68, right 003, up 113. End of update. [Pause]
094:21:31 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. This is Spider. I missed the first digit in the aft.
094:21:38 Roosa: Roger. Reading aft: l68.
094:21:45 Schweickart (Spider): NOUN 42.
094:21:46 Roosa: And NOUN 42 - I have no data - N slash A here. [Pause]
094:22:00 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger, Spider. I got the whole thing. You want to read something back?
094:22:04 Schweickart (Spider): I don't know if Houston is reading me or not.
094:22:06 Roosa: I'm reading you. Spider. Go ahead with the readback.
094:22:10 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. What's the last digit in the NOUN 42? [Pause]
094:22:20 Roosa: Okay. Are you asking for the last - Say again what column it is, Rusty.
094:22:26 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. The last digit in NOUN 42, DELTA-V.
094:22:32 Roosa: Roger. DELTA-V is 203.
094:22:37 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. And what is aft component, please?
094:22:40 Roosa: Roger. The aft component is l68.
094:22:45 Schweickart (Spider): Readback: 94 57 5300, minus 202, plus 004, minus 015 203 NA NA 3090, minus 1511, aft 168, right 003, up 113.

Range 46 miles.
094:23:35 Schweickart (Spider): Dave, this is Spider here.
094:23:38 Schweickart (Spider): No solution on that one.
094:23:41 Scott (Gumdrop): What do you need?
094:23:43 McDivitt (Spider): Nothing. I just wanted to tell you we got another solution on an elevation angle of 25.05.
094:23:47 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. I've got another one with elevation angle of 27.26.
094:23:51 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
094:23:53 Scott (Gumdrop): Beautiful.
094:23:55 Schweickart (Spider): Let's stick together.
094:23:57 Scott (Gumdrop): I'm with you. [Long pause]
Range rate, 91 feet per second now. If it's necessary to perform TPI zero it will be done at 94 hours 57 minutes 53 seconds. Delta V will be 20.3 feet per second.
However, the way this rendezvous is going now, that maneuver will not be performed, but we will get a GO/NO-GO to go past that point very shortly.
094:24:54 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, you are GO to go beyond TPI0.
094:25:00 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. Spider here. Understand we're GO past TPI0
094:25:04 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop copies.
094:25:05 Roosa: Roger. Roger.
Long comm break.
Range 47 miles, range rate 82 feet per second.
Range 48 and 1/2 miles, range rate 63 feet per second.
094:26:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Recorder on. And I'll tell you what; why don't you pitch up just a tad, and I'll get another mark here.
094:26:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It is coming right on down now.
094:26:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
094:26:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hello, tape recorder. This is the old CDR here. I've got a couple of comments about the spacecraft. The COAS has to be made brighter; it's just absolutely unusable the way it is now. I - I really have great skepticism about whether I'm even going to be able to dock this afternoon with it or not. I think that we really got to work to get something better than that. Also, I think that the restraints here pull you toward the front of the spacecraft too much, and you're continually pushing back. I think we could sure fix those up a little bit, although that - they are not nearly as aggravating as the COAS. The window shades are in the way all the time. And when I did the - when I use the AOT, I find that the - the reticle and the stars don't seem to be focused at the same place. Come on radar, don't screw up. Another red light flashing a little bit.
094:27:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Ohhh.
094:27:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 49 miles, [garble] ...
094:27:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, I guess those - those are the only comments I have right now. Oh, the spacecraft seems to be very ungainly when you're translating left to right, fore and aft, with the descent stage on it. MODE CONTROL, using PULSE, either PGNS or AGS, is very nice. We have awfully fine control, very good. The rate needles are absolutely atrocious. It's almost like flying without rate needles, and they ought to be - I'm sure that you could probably put a new set of rate needles in there for 0.1 of what it costs in fuel to oscillate back and forth. I think that's all I have for right now.
094:27:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, by the way, I can still see in the daytime here.
094:28:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Can you really?
094:28:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
094:28:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's see, he should be right out there in front of us, shouldn't he? Let me find him again.
094:28:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, so can I again.
094:28:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, he's like a star out there.
094:28:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
094:28:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, and what's the range now? It's 49 miles, now.
094:28:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 49 miles.
094:28:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, so that's pretty good.
Spider's orbit now is 136 by 111 nautical miles, following that phasing maneuver.
Gumdrop's orbit is 127 by 122. And the range is now 49 miles, range rate 53 feet per second.
094:28:17 McDivitt (Spider): Hey, Dave, we are 49 miles, and we can still see you.
094:28:21 Scott (Gumdrop): Hey, that's pretty good.
094:28:26 McDivitt (Spider): Okay.
094:28:27 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop. Do you want our guesstimate at your point of closest approach?
094:28:33 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. We'd like that.
094:28:35 Roosa: Roger. It will be 2.7 and the time is 95 plus 17.
094:28:42 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. 95 17.
094:28:45 Roosa: That's affirmative. And I'll be losing you here shortly off Canaries, and we'll see you over Carnarvon at 57. [Pause]
094:28:55 McDivitt (Spider): Roger.
094:28:56 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 94 hours 30 minutes, and we have LOS at Canaries. As we lost signal we were showing a range of 49 and a half miles, and a range rate of 43 feet per second. You heard CAPCOM Stu Roosa inform the crew that in this football that Spider is now in, the point of closest approach to Gumdrop will be 2.7 nautical miles. This will occur at an elapsed time of 95 hours 17 minutes. Spider does have a GO to proceed beyond TPI zero, we're in a nominal rendezvous, and the next maneuver we're looking toward is the insertion burn. We'll send up the maneuver information for this burn over Honeysuckle on this pass. It will take place shortly after acquisition at Guaymas on this pass, approximately 95 hours 40 minutes. Next station to acquire will be Carnarvon at 94 hours 57 minutes. We'll come back up then. This is Mission Control, Houston.
094:49:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, the tape is ON, and Gumdrop, we're turning off our tracking light.
094:49:49 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay.
094:49:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you got the AOT lamp closed; okay, VERB 37, ENTER; 52 - Oh, you've got to turn it up brighter than that, Jim - ENTER; VERB 22, ENTER; 3, ENTER; PRO; ENTER; VERB 21, ENTER; 215, ENTER; PRO.
094:50:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Ready, go.
094:50:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Go.
094:50:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Could you get that light up over my head off there, Rusty?
094:50:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, I'm going to turn that off, then I'm going to turn that off. Then I'm going to turn that off. How's that?
094:50:39 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's okay.
094:50:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Here he comes.
094:50:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 3, 2, 1 -
094:50:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
094:50:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Great Gadfrey. (Laughter) Okay. Ready?

094:52:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): One UP?
094:52:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): One DOWN, one DOWN.
094:52:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): One DOWN. Can we stop the LEFT/RIGHT?
094:52:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, stop the LEFT/RIGHT.
094:52:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CLEAR to mark either. Excuse me. I didn't see you mark that. Call that a mark, will you?
094:52:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): X.
094:52:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, turn to mark Y.

094:55:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Do the radar antennas seem to stay out of the way?
094:55:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes!
094:55:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You're CLEAR to mark either, by the way.
094:55:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. One more to the RIGHT.
094:55:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.

094:55:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ... Okay.
094:55:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Go.
094:55:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 225! By God, that's the right one! No shit, it's Acrux. Ready to maneuver?
094:55:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Go.
094:56:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Here you go.
094:56:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Gracious, sakes alive. Yes, we're going the same way we went last time.
094:56:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Isn't that amazing?
094:56:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Here he comes. 3, 2, 1 -
This is Apollo Control at 94 hours, 56 minutes and here is acquisition at Carnarvon.
CARNARVON (REV 60)
094:56:32 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by. And I have an insertion PAD whenever you are ready to copy. [Pause]
094:56:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
094:56:39 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hang on.
094:56:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, let it damp a little bit because we ...
094:56:43 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Gumdrop will be about 20 seconds.
094:56:47 Roosa: Roger. No problem. This is a 7-minute pass, and we will have Honeysuckle shortly thereafter. [Pause]
094:56:54 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. [Long pause]
094:56:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, go. Give me about two UP, three UP, maybe.
094:57:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Three UP, you've got them.
094:57:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right.
094:57:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): And, one to the RIGHT ...
094:57:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... And Houston.
094:57:08 McDivitt (Spider): Spider is reading you. We are in the middle of our alignment.
094:57:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): One to the RIGHT.
094:57:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
094:57:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Couple more UP.
094:57:14 Roosa: Roger, Spider. Copy. [Pause]
094:57:19 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble] this is the Gumdrop, Stu.
094:57:21 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop is ready any time.
094:57:23 Roosa: Roger. I would like to hold it, Gumdrop. Spider is in the middle of their alignment.
094:57:28 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. I'll wait for them. I'm ready whenever they are.
094:57:29 Roosa: Okay.
094:57:30 Roosa: Very good. [Pause]
094:57:34 Scott (Spider onboard): Stu, I'd like [garble].
094:57:35 Scott (Gumdrop): In the meantime, I can give you gyro torqueing angles if you like.
094:57:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): How about some more RIGHT?
094:57:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
094:57:38 Roosa: Okay. You cut me off by a few seconds; that was my next question. Go.
094:57:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, one - one more UP.
094:57:43 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. GET 94:57:00, plus 00083, plus 00008, minus 00034. [Pause]

Long comm break.
094:58:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Want another?
094:58:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No; you can stop the UP/DOWN though.
094:58:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): One DOWN.
094:58:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's good.
094:58:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] it's going to be faster if we do two, and then take one out.
094:58:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, Hell!
094:58:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): What is the matter?
094:58:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I marked an X when I should have marked a Y.
094:58:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Give me - Wait a minute, now. We've got a program alarm. Okay. You are CLEAR to mark either now.
094:58:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, shoot! Okay, I screwed the whole thing up, didn't I?
094:58:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Okay, give me one UP.
094:58:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): One UP.
094:58:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Stop the LEFT/RIGHT.

094:58:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, give me about one LEFT.
094:58:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): One LEFT.
094:59:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Did you give me two; that was probably alright.
094:59:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, I gave you one ROLL. I'm rolling when I think you are not marking, but keep that at zero.
094:59:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. CLEAR to mark Y. CLEAR to mark either.
094:59:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
094:59:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Give me one RIGHT.
094:59:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): One RIGHT.
094:59:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CLEAR to mark X.
094:59:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
094:59:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Just let her drift, right?
094:59:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Just let her drift, that's right.
094:59:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
094:59:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): One up. And one RIGHT, too.
094:59:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Left, I've got it.
094:59:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, I wanted it RIGHT, but that ...
094:59:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... You wanted it RIGHT?
095:00:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Stand by, just leave it - I don't want it where it is right now. Just let - let it go and let me see where it is going.
095:00:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
095:00:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): One LEFT or RIGHT. Never mind, Just leave it go. Okay. One UP.
095:00:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): One UP. CLEAR to mark either.
095:00:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
095:00:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, CLEAR to mark Y.
095:00:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, one - Just a minute. One RIGHT.
095:00:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CLEAR to mark either.
095:00:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, one DOWN. That's good. What pair; this is only the third pair.
095:00:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, no, no. It's the fifth pair.
095:00:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's see, is it? Okay. We lost that one.
095:00:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, I - I know.
095:00:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay ...
095:00:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CLEAR to mark Y.
095:00:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ... two DOWN and one LEFT.
095:00:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Two DOWN and one LEFT! Okay.
095:01:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Stop the UP/DOWN and another one LEFT.
095:01:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You got the mark.
095:01:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Just a - just a second.
095:01:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
095:01:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): This is a LEFT mark.
095:01:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): A Y mark.
095:01:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): A Y mark! (Laughter) Okay, there we are.
095:01:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
095:01:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh boy, terrible.
095:01:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Screwed up. Screwed it up!
095:01:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, torquing angle - Did you get - We're going to do a third star check on this -
095:01:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right.
095:01:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Plus 00089, plus 00055, plus 00037.
095:01:55 Roosa: And, Spider, this is Houston. I copy the angle.
095:02:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger - Roger.
095:02:01 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. Spider. [Pause]
095:02:10 Roosa: Roger. Looks like things are going well.
095:02:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Ready.
095:02:12 Roosa: Roger. And you might bring up your S-band volume. We'll be going over the Honeysuckle in about 2 minutes.
095:02:22 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop.
095:02:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger.
095:02:23 Schweickart (Spider): [Garble] this is the Spider. [Long pause]
095:02:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Make sure we don't get in gimbal lock there.
095:02:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Here he comes. Bang, right there.
095:02:56 Schweickart (Spider): Two miles, Houston.
Comm break.
095:02:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Stand by; I'm - I'll zero it for you. It's zero right now. [Garble] close. Wait a minute; stand by. Boy! You know, you get some slosh in there - Okay, now it is coming back in. It is a little to the RIGHT in yaw.
095:04:04 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Spider ready to copy the update.
095:03:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
095:03:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, and about one UP also. Okay, it's crossing right now.
095:03:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's good!
095:03:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. PRO, PRO, VERB 34, ENTER, the CB(11) AO BUS, OPEN, the lamp, OPEN, and a tape coming off and the time is 95:03:55.
095:03:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
095:04:06 Roosa: Okay. We're going to hand off to Honeysuckle. Let's - We'll have about a 30-secong breakout, and then we'll pick you back up again.
095:04:17 Schweickart (Spider): We'll be standing by [garble].
Comm break.
HONEYSUCKLE (REV 60)
095:05:20 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, Houston through Honeysuckle. How do you read? [Long pause]
095:06:09 Roosa: Okay, Spider/Gumdrop. I believe I've got you through Honeysuckle, if you are ready to copy.
095:06:14 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Spider ready to copy.
095:06:20 Roosa: Gumdrop, are you with me?
095:06:22 Schweickart (Spider): Gumdrop - He's on S-band.
095:06:27 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay.
095:06:28 Roosa: How do you read, Gumdrop? [Pause]
095:06:34 Schweickart (Spider): He doesn't have you latched up yet, Houston.
095:06:39 Roosa: Okay. I'll give you about another 30 seconds to a minute, and I'll read it.
095:06:45 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
Comm break.
095:07:52 Roosa: Hello, Spider. Houston with your insertion PAD. And, Gumdrop, if you can read.
095:08:00 Schweickart (Spider): Gumdrop, are you reading Houston yet?
095:08:05 Roosa: Hey, Rusty, I am going ahead and give it to you.
095:08:07 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Go ahead.
095:08:09 Roosa: Roger. Reading insertion: 095 39 0700, plus 00431 all zips, plus 00008 00431 000 104, plus 00431 all zips, plus 00012. End of update [Pause]
095:08:56 Schweickart (Spider): Roger, Readback - and, Gumdrop, you might get this. 095 39 0700, plus 00431 all zips, plus 00008 00431 all zips 104, plus 00431 all zips, plus 00012. [Pause]
095:09:23 Roosa: Okay, Spider. Your readback is correct. Gumdrop, did you copy?
095:09:29 Schweickart (Spider): Gumdrop, did you copy? [Long pause]
095:09:51 Schweickart (Spider): Hey, Dave, did you read Jim?
095:09:57 Schweickart (Spider): Gumdrop, do you read Spider? [Long pause]
095:10:21 Roosa: Spider, Gumdrop. We will probably lose you here at Honeysuckle in about a minute, and we will see you over the Mercury at 17.
095:10:31 Schweickart (Spider): Roger, Houston. This is Spider. Gumdrop, do you read that? [Pause]
095:10:37 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Gumdrop, be advised we can hear you transmitting, but your voice doesn't come through. [Pause]
095:10:56 Schweickart (Spider): And, Gumdrop, if you got the PAD, how about just giving a blip-blip on your microphone there?
Comm break.
095:12:16 McDivitt (Spider): Gumdrop, how do you read Spider?
095:12:21 McDivitt (Spider): Reading you loud and clear, Dave. We really lost track of you before. Were you reading us at all?
095:12:26 Scott (Gumdrop): I was reading you, but I wasn't reading Houston. I missed the insertion PAD. [Pause]
095:12:31 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. We copied. I'll have Rusty give it to you.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 95 hours 12 minutes. We've had loss of signal at Honeysuckle. Mercury will acquire et 95 hours 17 minutes. And as Gumdrop and Spider went over the hill at Honeysuckle showing a range just over 6 nautical miles, closing at about 100 feet per second. Their closest approach will be 2.7 miles. And then at elapsed time 95 hours 39 minutes 7 seconds over the Guaymas, Mexico station, Spider will perform the insertion maneuver, posigrade burn with the descent propulsion. 43.1 feet per second DELTA V. This maneuver will put them in a circular orbit with a - we are shooting for a constant delta height above the Gumdrop orbit of approximately 11 miles, and then Spider will start opening the gap, the distance between the LM vehicle and the CSM. We will come up with the GO/NO-GO decision on the insertion burn over the Mercury. We should be acquiring there in about a minute and a half.
095:16:47 Schweickart (Spider): This is GET insertion in six parts. Okay?
095:16:52 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. We're going to - We're waiting to do a VERB BD [garble] again.
095:16:56 Scott (Gumdrop): You're hot.
This is Apollo Control at 95 hours 16 minutes and we're at Mercury.
095:17:00 Schweickart (Spider): With a minus 8.
MERCURY (REV 60)
095:17:02 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, we have you through the Mercury. You should be right at your point of closest approach, 1.9. [Long pause]
FIDO has just updated that closest approach to 1.9.
095:17:41 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, how do you read Spider?
095:17:43 Roosa: Spider, I read you loud and clear. Did you copy my last transmission?
095:17:48 Schweickart (Spider): All I heard you say was we were at the point of closest approach, that was all. What else did you have to say?
095:17:52 Roosa: That was it. And 1.9 miles. Gumdrop, do you read Houston?
095:17:58 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger, Houston. I read you five-by.
095:18:00 Roosa: And you are five-square, Gumdrop.
095:18:04 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. I never got a lockup over the Honeysuckle.
095:18:07 Roosa: Roger. [Pause]
095:18:12 McDivitt (Spider): Houston, Spider here. Our closest approach was 16 000 feet on the radar.
095:18:18 Roosa: Roger. Copy. As you went over the hill at Honeysuckle I heard you reading the PAD to Gumdrop. You got it, didn't you, Dave?
095:18:25 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. All squared away. Thank you.
095:18:27 Roosa: Roger. [Long pause]
095:18:40 Schweickart (Spider): And, Houston, this is Spider. Did you get our torqueing angles on that last alignment?
095:18:44 Roosa: That is affirmative. We copied them.
095:18:47 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Fine.
095:18:48 Roosa: Looks like things are going well.
095:18:51 Schweickart (Spider): Yes. [Long pause]
095:19:44 Schweickart (Spider): And, Gumdrop, let us know when you want the track align back.
095:19:47 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Stand by.
095:19:50 McDivitt (Spider): Houston, Spider. When are we going to get the GO for insertion?
095:19:54 Roosa: Roger. You ought to have it within the next minute or two. We're looking - taking a look at the data. Everything's looking real good.
095:20:01 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Fine. How are we doing on the RCS RED LINE?
095:20:05 Roosa: You're real good. The LM is right on the predicted plot, and Gumdrop is in good shape. [Pause]
095:20:14 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. [Long pause]
095:20:37 Roosa: And, Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston. You are GO for insertion.
095:20:42 McDivitt (Spider): Spider.
095:20:43 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop. [Long pause]
095:20:59 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay, Spider. You can put your light back on. Thanks.
095:21:05 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. ON. [Pause]
095:21:11 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
095:21:12 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Long pause]
095:21:32 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. After insertion, we would like to leave the DFI on for approximately 5 minutes. We'll give you a call when to turn it off.
095:21:42 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
Comm break.
095:23:12 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop. About 30 seconds LOS Mercury. We may see you over Redstone around 31; if not, Guaymas at 35. [Pause]
095:23:23 McDivitt (Spider): Okay.
095:23:24 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, 95 hours 24 minutes. And as Spider and Gumdrop move out of range at the Mercury, the LM rendezvous radar showing a range of 5 and a half miles, a range rate of 99 feet per second. The radar at closest approach confirmed the Flight Dynamic Officer's first projection of 2.7 nautical miles. All of the consumables on both spacecraft are in good shape, propellant quanities, cryogenic quanities, all systems performing well. Redstone will acquire at 95 hours 31 minutes and shortly thereafter over Guaymas at 95:39:07, we will have the insertion maneuver. This is Mission Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 95 hours, 31 minutes. Gumdrop and Spider coming up on the Redstone now. Stand by.
REDSTONE (REV 60)
095:31:47 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, Houston. We have you through the Redstone. Standing by.
095:31:54 McDivitt (Spider): Right. [Long pause]
095:32:06 Schweickart (Spider): This LM DAP is really a nice flight control system, Houston.
095:32:10 Roosa: Roger. Copy, Spider.
Long comm break.
That was Jim McDivitt talking about the Digital Auto Pilot.
095:33:12 Unidentifiable crewmember (Spider): ... The tape is on OFF. Okay, CB(11) EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSE.

095:36:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That thing isn't even firing a PULSE! There it goes.
095:36:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): (Laughter) Yes, that's what it did as soon as I said it wasn't, too.
095:37:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It's not going to be that way on the ascent stage!
095:37:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'm afraid you are right.
095:37:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 2 minutes. DFI POWER, ON.

095:37:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, verify the burn attitude.
095:37:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. That looks good.
095:37:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Looks great.
095:37:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 7 degrees; okay that's just about right. Okay.
095:37:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, at 9 seconds we are ...
095:37:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... We have PGNCS and AGS attitude errors?
095:37:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, we did that.
095:37:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We're at 104 degrees; that's just right.
095:37:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): At 9 seconds you are going to begin ullage?
095:37:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right.
095:37:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): In 5 seconds you are going to press the engine ON?
095:37:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right.
095:37:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Highly efficient burn. How long is it suppose to be? 43 ft/sec, huh?
095:37:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right.
095:37:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Our engine OFF. I am going to turn the engine OFF. ENGINE ARM OFF, I mean. Come ON with JETS. You'll PRO at the residuals and burn out the residuals.
095:38:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right.
095:38:08 McDivitt (Spider): One minute.
095:38:09 McDivitt (Spider): MARK.
095:38:10 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Right with you, and ready to support.
095:38:13 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. [Long pause]
095:38:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, AVERAGE g's ON. CLEAR, 500 read. Okay. 20 seconds. Begin the ullage at 9.
095:38:48 McDivitt (Spider): Twenty seconds.
095:38:51 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. [Long pause]
095:38:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Ullage at 9.
095:38:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): This is going to a lot nicer ullage.
095:38:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I hope so.
095:39:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Ullage ON. PRO. Okay, go, baby. Descent quantity?
095:39:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
095:39:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Don't sweat that one.
095:39:14 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Starting.
We've got ignition -
095:39:15 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay.
095:39:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, then we're okay.
095:39:16 McDivitt (Spider): Right. [Long pause]
095:39:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Burning. They are both counting down together.
095:39:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Boy, it doesn't trim worth a hoot in hell, does it?
095:39:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No!
095:39:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 2, 1 -
095:39:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ENGINE CUTOFF.
095:39:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, get the ENGIHEARM OFF.
095:39:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Shutdown.
095:39:34 Schweickart (Spider): You're on [garble].
The burn looks good.
095:39:37 McDivitt (Spider): It's a good burn, Dave.
095:39:38 Scott (Gumdrop): Very good. Thank you. [Long pause]
095:39:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, here's the residuals: minus 0.9, minus 0.2, and minus 0.3.
095:40:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. That looks good.
095:40:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Aw, come on.
095:40:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's good, Rusty.
095:40:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
095:40:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, stand by here. Okay. R&D TELEMETRY, CAL; and DFI power, OFF; and I'll get the VERB 79. ENTER.
095:40:24 McDivitt (Spider): Houston, I'll give you R and D telemetry CAL now, and you can call me on the DFI power when you want it.
095:40:28 Roosa: Roger, Spider. We'll do that. We copied your burn; looked great. And saw your trimming [garble]. [Pause]
095:40:36 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. Going to CAL now. [Pause]
095:40:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. You got it in P00? Let's get the P00.
095:40:42 Roosa: And, Spider/Gumdrop. Whenever you are ready I have your CSI PAD. [Pause]
095:40:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. The landing radar breaker, OPEN. Alright -
095:40:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That was power just to landing radar breaker?
095:40:52 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop. Stand by. [Long pause]
095:40:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What's it doing all the thinking about? Did you punch up P00 in -
095:41:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, it's going into P00.
095:41:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Why this flashing 37?
095:41:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Because I had to KEY RELEASE.
095:41:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
095:41:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO.
095:41:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): THROTTLE CONTROL, AUTO.

095:41:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I got the CROSS TIE BALANCE LOADS, CLOSED.
095:41:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, PREP for the CSI pad, and don't forget to get that ...
095:41:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, while we are doing that, let me get the VERB 95, ENTER; VERB 37, ENTER; 20, ENTER.
095:41:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, and we're ready to - P00, come on, baby.
095:41:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, ready to error-monitor RENDEZVOUS RADAR?
095:41:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): RENDEZVOUS RADAR.
095:41:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we start the AUTO maneuver and debrief the burn. Or, you can start the AUTO maneuver while you debrief the burn?
095:42:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, we are going to maneuver. Didn't go in.
095:42:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You didn't wait long enough.
095:42:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. At 61 we should pitch up a little bit. Just about right. Okay, tape, that burn was smooth start.
095:42:17 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston. We're still showing all entry batteries on the line.
095:42:21 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. I haven't got to it yet. Thank you.
095:42:23 Roosa: Roger. [Long pause]
095:42:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Rather erratic steering in pitch, yaw, and roll. Did the residuals out very well. It had some pretty good size errors as it ran along through the - through the burn; but it looked like it got where it wanted to go.
095:42:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, there was a good bit of jet firing ...
095:42:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
095:42:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... on the thing.
095:42:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Smooth shutdown and no adverse comments about it.
095:42:48 Scott (Gumdrop): How's that?
095:42:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we got the VERB 95 in.
095:42:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
095:42:51 Roosa: Hey, that's pretty good.
095:42:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Don't forget that 4 - don't forget that 4-minute bias thing, now.
095:42:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, do that right now.
095:42:55 Scott (Gumdrop): I've got to take care of the left side before I get the right side.
095:42:59 Roosa: Roger. I didn't know I was rushing you, Dave. I just wanted to remind you.
095:43:03 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. I like those reminders.
095:43:05 Roosa: Roger. [Long pause]
Range 34 miles, range rate 121 feet per second.
095:43:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, how does that look?
095:43:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, we are locked on. Let me see if I can see him out there. Let me zero the needles.
095:43:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Never see him.
095:43:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): How's the signal strength?
095:43:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, it's at 2.5 and that's pretty good. That says we should be 25 miles, and we're at least that far out. Let me -
095:43:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, by the way, Mr. Tape, for your information ...
095:43:43 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston. At your convenience, if you want to, before you start your Marks here, just turn on the fan in H2 tank 2.
095:43:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble].
095:43:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. VERB 80.
095:43:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's accept him. VERB 80.
095:43:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): For your information, tape, we can't hear the burn at all. I never have been able to hear the engine burn, have you, Jim?
095:43:52 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. H2 tank 2 fans ON. Now?
095:43:55 Roosa: Roger. Thank you.
095:43:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What?
095:43:59 Scott (Gumdrop): Thank you.
Comm break.
095:43:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): The engine?
095:44:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): As a matter of fact, that is right. No.
095:44:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, not a bit of noise.
095:44:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's no - no audio problem at all. That's worth - quite well worth mentioning.
095:44:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. Absolutely no noise. Okay, tape, you are going to go OFF, and the time is 95:44:15. 2, 1 -
095:44:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
095:44:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Tape OFF.
095:46:59 Scott (Gumdrop): Spider, Gumdrop. P20 has you right down the barrel.
095:47:02 McDivitt (Spider): Oh, boy!
095:47:05 McDivitt (Spider): I wasn't able to do a visual lockon on you that time, David, but the range, or the signal strength on the radar was well up. [Pause]
095:47:10 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Good.
Range 39 miles, range rate 124 feet per second.
GUAYMAS (REV 61)
095:4X:XX Schweickart (Spider): ...Where we can get out of range [garble]. Good thing for the [garble] stability.
095:4X:XX Scott (Gumdrop): Yes, I bet it is.
095:4X:XX Schweickart (Spider): There's one nice thing to be said about optics, you can look through them and see if you...
095:4X:XX Scott (Gumdrop): Yes, sure can. You're still within range. I can see your four feet.
095:4X:XX Schweickart (Spider): Oh, you know the two parallel lines in the spectrum?
095:4X:XX Scott (Gumdrop): Yes.
095:4X:XX Schweickart (Spider): They are still there right now
095:4X:XX Scott (Gumdrop): Those are the ones.
095:4X:XX Schweickart (Spider): No, not those. Not the two little specks inside; the one in the center of the reticle.
095:49:24 Roosa: Spider, Houston. DFI OFF. And we are watching your DSKY, wondering when you are going to VERB 93 it. [Long pause]
095:49:50 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, if you are reading Spider, we would sure appreciate a guess at the CSI.
095:49:58 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. Say again, please.
095:50:03 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. We would appreciate again the CSI time and also where we are going [garble] final crossing over. [Pause]
095:50:16 Roosa: Okay, Spider. You are coming in real weak. I have your whole CSI PAD, if you wish it. Your CSI time is 096 16 0300. [Long pause]
095:50:36 Schweickart (Spider): Spider is reading; waiting for the whole PAD.
095:50:41 Roosa: Roger, Spider. How do you read Houston? [Pause]
095:50:49 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, Gumdrop is ready for the whole PAD, too. I believe Spider is reading you. Aren't you, Spider?
095:50:54 Schweickart (Spider): Well, I was. I just broke lock on the S-band. I don't know if I'm getting him on VHF or not.
095:50:59 Roosa: Spider, I'm reading you okay. Can you read me?
095:51:04 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. I read you that time, Smokey.
095:51:08 Roosa: Okay. Going with the CSI PAD: 096 16 0300 097 56 2300, minus 393 all zips 136, minus 392, minus 007; and I want to remind you again of the change in the TPI bias. It is now 4 minutes. [Pause]
095:52:01 Schweickart (Spider): Roger, Smokey. Sorry about that, but you broke up completely there. You are coming in very clear when you come in, but you're just broken. Go ahead and read through real fast now.
095:52:11 Roosa: Roger. 096 16 0300 097 56 2300, minus 393 all zips 136, minus 392, minus 007; and a reminder that the TPI bias is now 4 minutes. [Pause]
095:52:52 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Are you still with us, Houston?
095:52:57 Roosa: That is affirmative, Spider. We've got you now.
095:53:03 Schweickart (Spider): Okay, I'll read it back here. You are not coming through too well any more. 096 16 0300 097 56 2300, minus 393 all zips 136, minus 392, minus 007, and 4 minutes on the bias. [Pause]
095:53:28 Roosa: That is affirmative, Spider. Your readback is correct. And our COMM will pick up shortly. We will be going to Canaries.
095:53:36 Schweickart (Spider): Roger.
095:53:38 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop copies. [Pause]
095:53:46 Roosa: Spider, Houston. We'd like to have descent batteries 1 and 3 off the line.
Comm break.
095:55:00 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, are you still reading Spider?
095:55:03 Roosa: That's affirmative, Spider. We should have you here for about another 8 minutes.
095:55:09 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Did you hear my request on the apsidal crossing? Please.
095:55:15 Roosa: That is negative, Spider. I did not copy.
095:55:19 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. We would like your recommendation on first or second apsidal crossing. [Pause]
095:55:29 Roosa: Roger. We copy. Spider. Stand by. [Long pause]
095:55:53 Roosa: Spider? Spider, Houston. [Pause]
095:55:58 Schweickart (Spider): Go, Houston.
095:56:01 Roosa: Roger. I'm reading you very weak, but we want the second apsidal crossing. [Pause]
095:56:09 Schweickart (Spider): Understand. Second apsidal crossing.
095:56:12 Roosa: That's affirm.
Comm break.
The apsidal crossing refers to the line of apsides which is the line straight line from apogee to perigee in an orbit.

096:00:02 Scott (Gumdrop): I get you 0.4 feet per second out of plane at this time.
096:00:07 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Fine. Thank you.
096:00:10 Roosa: And, Spider and Gumdrop, this is Houston. We have an update to your CSI PAD. It is the DELTA-V component now reading plus 006. [Pause]
096:00:26 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. DELTA-V. Understand plus 006. Is affirmative?
096:00:32 Roosa: That is affirmative, Spider.
096:00:36 Schweickart (Spider): Thank you. [Long pause]
096:01:33 Roosa: Okay, Spider and Gumdrop. We'll lose you in about a minute and a half off Canary. If you want to talk to me anytime within the next 10 minutes, tell ARIA 5 to go REMOTE.
096:01:43 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. We'll do it. Gumdrop. [Pause]
096:01:54 Roosa: And we'll see you over Tananarive at 16.
096:01:58 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. [Long pause]
096:02:47 Roosa: Spider. Disregard.
096:02:53 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, did you want Spider?
096:02:55 Roosa: Disregard, Spider.
096:02:58 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control and Canaries has LOS. During this long pass we very successfully performed the insertion maneuver - the last in the series of burns to seperate Gumdrop and Spider. Back in Gemini, we launched two vehicles on - separate launch vehicles and they were separated to begin with and we rendezvoused them that way. However, these vehicles started joined, and we've gone through this series of maneuvers to separate them. The maneuvers that remain will be a realistic simulation of the lunar mission rendezvous problems. We have a time for this CSI or coeliptic sequence initiation of 96 hours, 16 minutes, 3 seconds. It will be performed over the Tananarive Station in about 11 minutes, 15 seconds. This will be a retrograde maneuver, using the reaction control system thrusters on the Lunar Module. And Spider will be staged just after thrusting begins. We will jettison the descent stage of the Lunar Module during this burn. The Delta V of 39.3 feet per second. We passed up a pad on this maneuver to the crew but from here on out, the crew will be using onboard solutions. Unless their own solutions very greatly from the pad passed up from the ground. This pad is passed up as a backup, but the remaining maneuvers in the rendezvous sequence will be performed from onboard solutions. And Gumdrop will be prepared to perform a mirror image maneuver 1 minute after the LM should have burned, if for some reason Spider cannot burn. We may get an ARIA call in here; we have an ARIA aircraft in this area that we can communicate through if we -
If we do call through the ARIA -
096:06:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Tape ON.
096:06:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. We'll PROCEED out of there.
096:06:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. 82 minus 38.0, zips and minus 24.5.
096:06:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Go.
096:06:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Go.
096:06:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, 9:39. The clock is about right.
096:06:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I missed the 10-minute mark. Let me try to get that. 1, 27. Okay, can you carry on there, please?
096:06:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Okay, I don't think we need to mess with that; we are going to burn this one here anyway, here so, if - if it agrees with the ground, why don't we just skip the charts?
096:06:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'll just copy down the number, here.
096:06:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
096:06:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): The range was 62.5.
096:06:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble].
096:06:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Gumdrop? Gumdrop, Spider here. Our solution is 400. At the same time, we are going to burn our solution.

This is Apollo Control. We're showing Spider's orbit now 134 by 139 following the insertion burn. This CSI burn is designed to change the orbit, will keep the apogee essentially at 139, bring perigee down to 10 or 11 miles below the Gumdrop orbit. When we get - when Spider gets to the 10 nautical mile point below he will perform another maneuver to circularize that orbit, make it a constant DELTA high -

096:11:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I'll read them to you? DECA GIMBAL, OPEN.
096:11:31 Roosa: Hello, Spider/Gumdrop. This is Houston. How do you read? [Pause]
We've asked the ARIA to go back local, so apparently we won't try to communicate through the ARIA. But through the constant DELTA height maneuver that will come after the CSI burn, we will start catching up - Spider will start catching up to Gumdrop. It's a reverse of the situation after he performed the insertion maneuver. That put him higher, he fell behind. After the CDH maneuver he will be lower and will start catching up, and this CSI maneuver, which is coming up over Tananarive, is designed to change the orbit and get the perigee down to where Spider will be able to perform the CDH burn. Spider has a GO for the burn and for staging, everything on the ground and onboard looks good for the maneuver. Tananarive will acquire about 96 hours 15 and a half minutes, that's approximately 4 minutes from now.
096:11:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): DECA GIMIBAL, OPEN.
096:11:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): FLIGHT DISPLAYS, THRUST, OPEN.
096:11:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): FLIGHT DISPLAYS, THRUST, OPEN.

096:11:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CB(16), EPS, CROSS TIE BALANCE LOADS going OPEN, and I'm going to watch your bus voltage. Okay, it's holding in there good.
096:12:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:12:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, where are we now?
096:12:04 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston. How do you read?
Long comm break.
096:12:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): RCS and APS temperatures and pressures.
This is Apollo Control. We are not having any luck through the ARIA, but we're coming up on Tananarive very shortly now. Duration of the CSI burn will be about 30 seconds.
096:12:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, and we're at the 4-minute check and we're right on time there. Go ahead and read that one.
096:12:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ASCENT is 68, 68; 180 and 180. Looks good.
096:12:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, TTCA, JETS, DOWN.
096:12:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): TTCA, JETS, DOWN.
096:12:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, MASTER ARM, ON.
096:12:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:12:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Stand by here.
096:12:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MASTER ARM, ON. I've got two yellow lights. How about that!
096:12:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Great! Verify burn attitude.
096:12:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. We're coming up on it. 3 minutes to go. Okay, Gumdrop, we're about 3:15 now.
096:12:50 Scott (Spider onboard): Roger, [garble] with you and ready to support.
096:12:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:12:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I don't like that AGS. Yes, I guess it's alright. Yes, it's coming down. Okay, stand by for 2 minutes.
096:13:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, Rusty, we're at 2 minutes. Verify the burn attitude [garble] to clear the PGNS. Okay, now what are we going to do. When we start burning, TTCA, COMMANDER, PLUS-X; then hit the stage fire [garble].
096:13:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I guess we're going to open the window shade, too.
096:13:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You want to check to make sure that your things are set up there.
096:13:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
096:13:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, I am going to start the fire, then I'm going to stage. When I think everything's under control, I'm going to say ASCENT INTERCONNECTS.
096:13:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:13:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Then we're just going to press on like that. You're going to ASCENT the INTERCONNECTS and the main shutoff valves and all that stuff; get down to 9 feet per second, you're going to - to close them up again. Right?
096:13:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right.
096:13:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:13:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Stand by for a thump on the feed, too.
096:13:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, we're not going to be able to watch it [garble].
096:13:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): And as we repressurize or anything, I'm going to continue the PRESS right on with the burn.
096:13:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right-o.
096:14:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Let me see how that's doing now. Okay, it's coming in. Good, there was 2 minutes. Okay.
096:14:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, it's about a minute and 30 now, Gumdrop.
096:14:35 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
096:15:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Getting high, isn't it?
096:15:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, it's not. It's doing good.
096:15:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, wait a second. We're just going into darkness, aren't we?
096:15:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
096:15:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:15:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, you ready?
096:15:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, all set. Yes, I got to do them one at a time, here. AVERAGE-G's ON.
096:15:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, start two little yellow lights.
Ten seconds from the burn.
We are going to have to wait till we establish lockon to find out how this burn goes.
096:16:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, thrusting?
096:16:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Thrusting, staged. Okay, INTERCONNECT.
096:16:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, coming OPEN.
096:16:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Foot staging. Everything looks good, here.
096:16:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I don't see anything out there. Would you call that out loud?
096:16:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 13 feet per second.
096:16:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:16:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 10, 8, [garble].
096:16:40 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
096:16:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Go ahead.
096:16:45 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
096:16:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We have a good burn. Do you read?
096:16:51 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
096:16:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger. We have a good burn. How do you read?
096:16:58 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. Did you burn? [Long pause]
096:17:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. The residuals are zero, Gumdrop. The residuals are zero. It was a good burn.
096:17:10 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
096:17:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble]. It was a good burn, Gumdrop. It was a good burn.
096:17:24 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
096:17:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Burn time residuals were zero.
096:17:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, [garble].

096:17:41 Roosa: Tananarive M&O, this is Houston CAP COMM. Do you read?
096:17:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): This is Spider, here; Houston. That was a good burn. We're staged.
096:17:45 Communications Technician: Houston CAP COMM, Tananarive. Roger.
096:17:47 Roosa: Okay. Have you heard any transmission from the spacecraft?
096:17:51 Communications Technician: That's a negative.
096:17:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Say again?
096:17:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): PRESS REG's A and B, to CABIN.
096:17:54 Roosa: Are you locked on?
096:17:55 Communications Technician: That's affirmative.
096:17:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, go ahead. SUIT - next step is SUIT GAS DIVERTER, PUSH to CABIN.
096:17:58 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop. Houston through Tananarive. [Long pause]
096:18:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Got it.
096:18:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:18:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, now we got to hustle here.
096:18:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
096:18:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, CSI; VERB 95, ENTER. I got it.
096:18:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Don't - don't forget to - put the bias in ...
096:18:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... VERB 20, ENTER. Right, I will.
096:18:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, go. I - I'll get it, and get over there. See where he is. Is your tape still on?
096:18:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, it is. I'm going to take my gloves off.
096:18:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, there was a pretty-good-sized thump at staging and a cloud of debris out front.
096:18:37 Scott (Spider onboard): Spider, Gumdrop; you say you've got a good burn and cleaned it up. Is that affirm?
096:18:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's affirmative. A good burn ..
096:18:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): There you go.
096:18:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): And we cleaned it up.
096:18:43 Scott (Spider onboard): Gee, I can read you now.
096:18:44 Scott (Gumdrop): Thank you. [Pause]
096:18:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Ready?
096:18:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, go.
096:18:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, now we got to do the NOUN 31, ENTER; 9656 ...
096:18:49 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, Houston. Do you read? [Pause]
096:19:00 Roosa: Tananarive M&O, Houston CAP COMM. Go MANUAL key procedure.
096:19:05 Communications Technician: Roger.
096:19:07 Roosa: And, Spider - Spider, this is Houston. How do you read? [Pause]
096:19:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Houston, I'm reading you broken. Be advised we had a good burn, and we're staged.
096:19:19 Roosa: Gumdrop - Gumdrop, this is Houston. How do you read?
Comm break.
096:19:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, it's 96 [garble] 6 ...
096:19:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): He's going to be right in the Moon.
096:19:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... 9. 1 plus 45 is going to be ...
096:19:37 Scott (Spider onboard): Hot mike.
096:19:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Thank you. [Garble] coming up. Came on. Houston, Spider. How do you read?
096:19:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): A lot of ...
096:19:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Gumdrop, our CDH time is 96:58:14.
096:20:08 Scott (Spider onboard): 96:58:14.
096:20:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's affirmative.
096:20:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We get a lot of signal strength, but he's right out there where I can't see him. The Moon's there. Gumdrop, have you come back around where your light is pointing at us yet?
096:20:22 Roosa: And, Tananarive M&O, Houston CAP COMM. Let me know of any transmission you hear between the two spacecraft.
096:20:23 Scott (Spider onboard): Roger.
096:20:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] heater. Okay, that's the one they warned us about.
096:20:28 Communications Technician: Roger.
Comm break.
Flight Dynamics is tracking. Looks like the burn was done on time. We do have tracking at Tananarive, but we've had consistently bad communications throughout this mission at Tananarive. It is not an S-band station. The radar data indicates the burn was done on time. We'll have to confirm that - probably over Carnarvon when we can talk to the crew.
096:20:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, I don't see you out there, I guess.
096:20:32 Scott (Spider onboard): I haven't turned it up yet.
096:20:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, let me ...
096:20:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ATT HOLD.
096:20:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That signal strength looks good, though. It's a little more responsive on the ascent stage, isn't it?
096:20:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
096:20:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I just can't see out there, Rusty. There's nothing out there but Moon.
096:21:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Plus 000, line 6.

096:21:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's take it, yes.
096:21:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, VERB 80, ENTER.
096:21:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We don't really have much choice. He's going to be out there - right by that Moon - all the way in.
096:21:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we'll look at the first update and see what happens.
096:21:42 Roosa: Tananarive M&O, Houston CAP COMM. I think someone there has an open mike.
096:21:47 Communications Technician: Houston CAP COMM, Tananarive.
096:21:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Houston, how do you read Spider? Houston, how do you read Spider? Hey, Gumdrop, if Houston reads you, would you pass them the T - the CDH time of 96:58:14?
096:21:51 Roosa: Go ahead.
096:21:53 Communications Technician: Roger. We heard one transmission from the spacecraft which said, "Go ahead.
096:22:01 Roosa: Okay. Thank you.
096:22:02 Roosa: And, Spider. Spider, this is Houston. We'll see you over Carnarvon at 32.
Very long comm break.
096:22:07 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
This is Apollo Control at 96 hours, 22 minutes. Gumdrop and Spider are beyond the station at Tananarive now. No success in establishing communications through Tananarive, however, Flight Dynamics Officer Dave Reed says that radar tracking indicates the burn was performed on time and properly. We'll have to wait until we get to Carnarvon to verify this with the crew. We're about 45 minutes away from the next maneuver - the CDH burn or Constant Delta Height Burn. This is the maneuver that will allow Spider to start closing the range with Gumdrop. It will put Spider on the trajectory from which he will do his Terminal Phase Initiation to rendezvous. Acquisition at Carnarvon at 96 hours, 31 and one-half minutes - about seven minutes from now. We'll come back up than. This is Mission Control Houston.
096:22:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Gumdrop, do you read Spider on this antenna?
096:22:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Gumdrop, how about this antenna?
096:22:53 Scott (Spider onboard): Roger. I read you. You read me?
096:22:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger. Did you read the other call I just made?
096:22:58 Scott (Spider onboard): I heard both of them.
096:23:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Looks like I can only receive you on my number 2 antenna, here. Did you pass the CDH time to Houston?
096:23:07 Scott (Spider onboard): No, I haven't had any contact. Do you have your tracking light on?
096:23:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, I do.
096:23:20 Scott (Spider onboard): And I guess you don't see me?
096:23:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, I sure don't, Dave. You've got the Moon behind you.
096:23:26 Scott (Spider onboard): No, I don't see you either.
096:23:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Gracious. Hope our tracking light didn't fail!
096:23:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's not flashing.
096:23:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It's not?
096:23:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No. Let's check the breaker.
096:23:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Gumdrop, we no longer see the flash off our quad, but now that could have been reflection from the porch. So we - we can't really be sure.
096:24:08 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, well, I don't see you.
096:24:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Roger.
096:24:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's encouraging.
096:24:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, isn't it?
096:24:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, let me mush on here ...
096:24:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We're - we're going to really be scrambling for a ground solution for this mess.
096:24:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, you're right. I better get a good chart, here.
096:25:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, the tape is still on if you want to comment on that staging.
096:25:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, the staging wasn't too bad. There were some attitude excursions, but not too much.
096:25:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:25:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): The cloud of debris, none of it very large; and I wasn't able to see the descent stage go away. Not because it wasn't there; just because I was too busy.
096:25:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, and we're coming up with VERB 32 here, for the first recycle, and I got the VERB 93 in. And I also taped on the interconnect. I can't get over there in this restraint system to use two hands, to do them both at once, so I have to do them one at a time, and that makes it a little bit slower. And then, when I went to shut them off, we got a sticky talkback on that SYSTEM A ASCENT FEED number 2; and it did not go barber pole when I shut it off. So I rapped the panel, and it went barber pole. So that was a bit dicey, too.
096:26:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, I don't see him out there any place.
096:26:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, tape's going OFF.
This is Apollo Control at 96 hours 31 minutes. Spider and Gumdrop approaching Carnarvon. We will find out here how that burn went. We will go then to the Honeysuckle pass and we will be sending up a backup CCH pad to the crew over Honeysuckle. We will stand by for acquisition at Carnarvon.
CARNARVON (REV 61)
096:32:35 Roosa: Hello, Spider/Gumdrop. Houston through Carnarvon.
Tel comm confirms staging.
096:32:37 Roosa: How did it go?
096:32:40 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, this is Spider. How do you read?
096:32:41 Roosa: I'm reading you five-square. Spider.
096:32:45 Schweickart (Spider): Hey, let me give you the CDH time. It is 96 58 14.
096:32:52 Roosa: Roger. Copy 96 58 plus 14, and that is a bias time. Affirmative?
096:32:58 Schweickart (Spider): Affirmative. That's the actual time we will perform CDH.
096:33:03 Roosa: Roger. Copy.
096:33:05 McDivitt (Spider): Houston, this is Spider. How do you read me?
096:33:09 Roosa: I'm reading you loud and clear, Jim.
096:33:11 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. The staging went okay. We are staged. However, Gumdrop can't find us in his optics any longer, and we may have knocked out our tracking light.
096:33:23 Roosa: Roger, Spider. Copy.
096:33:27 McDivitt (Spider): Before, we could see it flashing out on our quads out here, and I don't see it flashing now, although the flash may have been reflected off something on the descent stage.
096:33:37 Roosa: Roger. Understand, Spider.
096:33:42 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. And, Houston, this is Spider. I forgot what I was going to ask you.
096:33:51 McDivitt (Spider): Houston, I know what I want to tell you. That burn we made was 40 feet per second; 40.0, in case you are interested.
096:34:01 Roosa: Roger, Spider. Could you give me T and DELTA-V?
096:34:08 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. The TIG of the burn was the TIG that you passed us on the PAD for CSI and DELTA-V was 0. [Pause]
096:34:21 Roosa: Roger, Spider. Thank you very much.
096:34:24 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. And our first solution after CDH, we have a 4 second-early TPI. [Pause]
096:34:34 Roosa: Copy, Spider. [Pause]
096:34:40 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, Gumdrop is reading but very weak
096:34:43 Roosa: You are coming loud and clear to me, Gumdrop.
096:34:47 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Long pause]
096:34:59 Roosa: And, Spider, this is Houston. The first cut at it, your CDH time looks real good. And could you give me an onboard RCS quantity?
096:35:08 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Onboard RCS is reading 85 and 77.
096:35:15 Roosa: Roger. 85, 77. Thank you. [Long pause]
096:35:49 Schweickart (Spider): Hey, Gumdrop, Spider.
096:35:52 Scott (Gumdrop): Go.
096:35:53 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Our staging works better than your undocking.
096:35:57 Scott (Gumdrop): Ah ha. You're one up on me. [Long pause]
096:36:10 Roosa: Spider, you had better wait until you get back before you start that.
096:36:14 McDivitt (Spider): You haven't heard me say anything. [Long pause]
That was Rusty Schweickart taking a little dis at Gumdrop.
Showing a range of 98-1/2 nautical miles and a range rate of 30 feet per second.
096:37:03 Roosa: Okay, Spider/Gumdrop. We are about 30 seconds LOS Carnarvon. There will be about a 2-minute break. We will see you over Honeysuckle with your S-band volume up.
096:37:12 McDivitt (Spider): Roger.
096:37:13 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control. Carnarvon has LOS; Honeysuckle will acquire in a minute or two. The crew's, Spider's crew, has come up with a solution that the CDH maneuver should be performed.
HONEYSUCKLE (REV 61)
096:38:23 Scott (Gumdrop): Spider, Gumdrop. How about a range and range rate readings?
096:38:28 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. We are at 98.5 miles at 10 feet per second. [Pause]
096:38:44 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. I did. That's pretty good.
096:38:49 Scott (Gumdrop): Yea. If you can just see me, right? [Long pause]
096:39:37 Schweickart (Spider): Oh, about 10 minutes before the burn. About 10 or 12 minutes before the burn.
096:39:45 Schweickart (Spider): You can hold off If you want, but I would like your solution as soon as you can give it to me.
096:39:54 McDivitt (Spider): Well, don't hold off until [garble].
096:39:58 Scott (Gumdrop): Oh, don't worry. [Long pause]
096:40:38 Scott (Gumdrop): Spider, Gumdrop. Seven minutes is a little late. I've got to make a 140-degree maneuver at that time.
096:40:43 Schweickart (Spider): Okay, Dave. Go when you have to.
096:40:46 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Pause]
096:40:56 McDivitt (Spider): Did you get our CDH time?
096:40:58 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. I have the time, but I haven't received any PAD yet. Have you?
096:41:02 McDivitt (Spider): Negative.
096:41:03 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay.
096:41:04 Scott (Gumdrop): They just said that they thought the time looked pretty good.
096:41:06 McDivitt (Spider): Okay.
096:41:09 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, Houston. We're working on the PAD. We've got about 4 minutes LOS here. We'll try to have it. [Pause]
096:41:21 Scott (Gumdrop): You probably didn't hear him, but he said he's working on it, and they'll probably have it before the LOS in 4 minutes. [Pause]
096:41:35 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. We're not reading him.
096:41:37 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. I'll pick it up for you. I might as well do something. [Long pause]
096:42:01 McDivitt (Spider): I can have him do a lot of good tracking when it gets daylight.
096:42:05 Scott (Gumdrop): But that's what we're built for.
Comm break.
096:43:26 Schweickart (Spider): Gumdrop, Spider.
096:43:28 Scott (Gumdrop): Go ahead.
096:43:30 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. In case I can't hear him on S-band, you might copy down the whole PAD this time. It's only three more lines past when you normally get.
096:43:39 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. I've been doing that all the way, anyway.
096:43:41 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Thank you.
096:43:44 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. [Pause]
096:43:49 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, Houston. We're about a minute from LOS, so we'll try to pick up our PAD over the Huntsville at around 47. [Pause]
096:44:01 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger, Houston. Gumdrop copies. PAD over Huntsville at 47, and can you transmit to Gumdrop from [garble]. [Pause]
096:44:14 Roosa: Gumdrop, transmit to Gumdrop how?
Long comm break.
And we had LOS at the Honeysuckle. The little bit of tracking we've been able to do on Spider since that CSI burn shows the Spider orbit at 138 by 113 nautical miles. As you heard the CSI burn went well, performed at the time of the ground's pad at 96 hours, 16 minutes, 3 seconds, 40 feet per second. The LM staged perfectly, however, there is a suspicion that during the staging the tracking light may have been knocked out. Gumdrop reports he cannot see Spider through his optics, at this range. We got onboard quantity readings for the two reaction control systems on Spider. Doing very well there; 85 percent remaining in this A system, 77 percent in the B system. The Control Officer here in the Mission Control room, and Control is the name for the LM Guidance, Navigation and Control Officer. It's called a GNC for the CSM and his counterpart for the LM is Control. He reports that the ascent engine looks in good shape for this next burn, the CDH burn. It will be performed by the APS, or the Ascent Propulsion System, and will be the first burn for this engine. It will be a short one, and Spider has come up with a solution on board showing an ignition time of 96 hours, 58 minutes, 14 seconds. That's in close enough agreement to the ground's, that we'll probably allow them to burn at this time. We'll pass up a pad at the Huntsville. We have acquisition at the Huntsville now. We have not yet put in a call nor have we heard any air-to-air conversation. If we burn at that time we'll be out of contact. That burn would come between the Huntsville and the Redstone out over the middle of the Pacific Ocean. We'll stand by for -
096:44:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Tape is ON, and it's 96:44:30. Just set the final COMP for CDH. How many marks did we have there?
096:44:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I don't know.
096:44:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): About 14, or something like that if I ...
096:44:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): The number I last looked at was 13.
096:44:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
096:44:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'm pretty sure.
096:44:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): About 14 marks.
096:45:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, let's hope that radar stays locked on to Dave. Okay, look at that - 10 miles.
096:45:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, boy.
096:45:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:45:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Did you get that?
096:45:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. Go. VERB - You want to do the VERB 90. Oh.
096:45:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, shit.
096:45:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's alright. Why don't you do it, and take a look at it right now.
096:46:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
096:46:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): VERB 90, ENTER.
096:46:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What's the time?
096:46:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, the time is 96:58:14.
096:46:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 58?
096:46:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 58:14.
096:46:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
096:46:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, good. Okay, come on radar. Stay locked.
096:46:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Sure looks great. It's a big one. Well, that's the way it goes.
096:46:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): What do you want to do? Forget it?
096:46:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, let's just forget it.
096:46:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:46:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay?
096:47:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 11 ...
096:47:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 17 marks we had.
096:47:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 17 marks. Okay.
096:47:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Got that?
096:47:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, got it. Okay, you may have to get my - Okay, you going to P00?
096:47:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You're in P00.
096:47:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you ready?
096:47:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Go.
096:47:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Transmit the burn data to CSM.
HUNTSVILLE (REV 61)
096:47:36 Schweickart (Spider): Gumdrop, Spider.
096:47:38 Scott (Gumdrop): Go.
096:47:39 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Here is the burn: minus 39.2, plus 0.1 and minus 13.7. [Pause]
096:47:56 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Minus 39.2, plus 0.1, and minus 13.7.
096:48:03 Schweickart (Spider): That's Charlie.
096:48:04 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay [garble].
096:48:05 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. Do you read me?
096:48:09 Schweickart (Spider): Roger, Houston. Spider copies.
096:48:10 Roosa: Roger. I just copied your solution. I have one that's pretty close to it, if you'd like to copy a CDH PAD.
096:48:18 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Go.
096:48:20 Scott (Gumdrop): Go. Gumdrop.
096:48:21 Roosa: Roger. And Roger, Gumdrop. 096 58 1400, minus 382, minus 009, minus 151 305, minus 381, minus 153. End of update. [Pause]
096:48:56 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. 096 58 1400, minus 382, minus 009, minus 151 305, minus 381, minus 153. [Pause]
096:49:12 Roosa: Spider, that is affirmative. Your readback is correct. [Pause]
096:49:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, how did we make out?
096:49:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Good.
096:49:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:49:20 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay
096:49:21 Scott (Gumdrop): Spider, Gumdrop here. I did not copy the update [garble] I got the ground PAD [garble] did [garble].
096:49:25 Scott (Spider onboard): I copied you, and were all the signs minus?
096:49:29 Schweickart (Spider): That's affirmative [garble].
096:49:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): All the signs were minus.
096:49:31 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. I've got the ground PAD now, and I'll monitor it [garble] 1 minute late.
096:49:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Roger.
096:49:37 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Very good. [Long pause]
096:49:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We're going to do ours, I guess. I haven't had a chance to compare them, Dave, but they sound pretty good.
096:49:41 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:49:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Go. They - They're within a foot per second or so, even in D.
096:49:53 McDivitt (Spider): Do you have all of our solution here, Dave?
096:49:54 Scott (Spider onboard): Roger. I have minus 39.2, minus ...
096:49:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, hold off.
096:49:58 Scott (Spider onboard): ... 0.1 ...
096:49:59 Scott (Gumdrop): Yes, minus 13.7.
096:50:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Roger.
096:50:01 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, That's plus 0.1.
096:50:03 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, plus ...
096:50:04 Scott (Gumdrop): 0.1.
096:50:06 McDivitt (Spider): Alrighty.
Comm break.
096:50:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, let's put it up there.
096:50:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. We're standing for that mark. Signal strength is staying up, so we're probably going to get it.
096:50:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. I'm going to have to hustle, too.
096:50:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
096:50:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): After that - What's after that? You can go ahead and do the AUTO maneuver ...
096:50:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Roger.
096:50:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... and let me get the AGS started here.
096:50:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] call up 42, to do the AUTO maneuver.
096:50:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Cue me at 7 minutes here, Jim.
096:50:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, go ahead, I'll - I'll - Matter of fact, I'll get the range rate for you.
096:50:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I can't go any further right now anyway.
096:50:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): (Laughter) That [garble] don't [garble] is it?
096:50:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
096:50:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you want to read it out for me, and I'll just sit over ...
096:50:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:50:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... here in my corner and plod away.
096:50:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's going to be close to 108 or so. Maybe 110.
096:51:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 4, 3, 2, 1 -
096:51:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
096:51:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 110.
096:51:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 110. Okay, thank you.
096:51:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. I'm going to call up - Would you align the AGS? - I'm going to call up and do the maneuver now.
096:51:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right.
096:51:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): VERB 37, ERTER; 42, ENTER. Okay, it says 306, and I think our number was 305. Okay, we'll do the maneuver. Here we go.
096:51:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] do a pitch up the right way.
096:52:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] says minus 39.5 and minus 14.5.
096:52:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): How about that? Okay, minus - Got that NOUN 86 stuff?
096:52:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. Okay, you got it? Minus 39.1. All zips and plus - and minus 13.8.
096:52:49 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, we'll see you over the Redstone at about 03. [Pause]
096:52:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Roger. Did you get that?
096:52:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, I got it.
096:52:58 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Gumdrop copies. Redstone, 03.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, 96 hours, 53 minutes. Redstone has LOS. This CDH burn, 4 minutes, 55 seconds away from it now. We will not be in touch with Spider or with Gumdrop when Spider performs this maneuver. We'll have to wait until we get to Redstone to find out how it went. The ground solution agreed very closely to the onboard solution for this upcoming burn. Time was the same. Total DELTA V in the ground solution, 38.2 feet per second. The onboard solution came up 39.2. The crew will very probably burn their own solution. After this burn the Spider will start catching up to Gumdrop, so that they will be able to perform the terminal phase of this rendezvous. Redstone due to acquire 97 hours, 2 and a half minutes. We'll come back up then. This is Mission Control Houston.
096:52:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I want to get my gloves on first.
096:53:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. We don't need anything there; we might as well PRO over there.
096:53:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Okay, you can mush on here, and ...
096:53:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, it's a 501.
096:53:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... I'm going to get the AGS going here.
096:53:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MODE CONTROL, AUTO.
096:53:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, MODE CONTROL, AUTO. We go down to [garble].
096:54:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): HELIUM MONITOR, ASC PRESSURE 1 and 2.
096:54:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We're at 4 minutes here. Just got there?
096:54:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): SUIT PRESSURE 1 and 2; CB(11), STAB CONTROL, AELD, CLOSE.
096:54:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And 16. I got mine.
096:54:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:54:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): EPS, CROSS TIES ...
096:54:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): BALANCE LOAD comes OPEN.
096:54:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Shoot, it's been OPEN. I forgot to close it.
096:54:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Alrighty.
096:54:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): STOP button's UNCOVER.
096:54:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Boy, that scared me. That - that ammeter drifts up and - on the bus, and it was up at 100 amps, indicated.
096:54:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, jeez.
096:54:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It doesn't read anything worthwhile. Okay, you ready?
096:55:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
096:55:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 2 minutes, we want DFI, ON.
096:55:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right. 2 minutes, we want DFI, ON.
096:55:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, what else do we do here except hold our breath?
096:55:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. 5 seconds. You're going to get the FLASH 99; you're going to put to PROCEED.
096:55:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right.
096:55:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): AUTO [garble] at 3.5. Then it's going to go kapow, and the burn's going to be over.
096:55:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
096:55:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's see, TEMP [garble].
096:55:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Would you look at that? It's still locked on, or something.
096:55:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You're right. It is still locked on, so we didn't pitch up very much, at Z.
096:55:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. We're in the right attitude though, huh?
096:55:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. 30 ...
096:55:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:55:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ... 305 was the ground-calculated solution, and the PGNS called for 306.89.
096:55:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. [Garble]. What, you got your window shade up?
096:55:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. I'm on the dark [garble].
096:55:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It's a big difference, isn't it?
096:56:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, 2 minutes.
096:56:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, DFI POWER, ON.
096:56:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. I verified the burn there, too, as best I can.
096:56:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, that looks good.
096:56:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
096:56:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. I'm just standing by to proceed.
096:56:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Good.
096:56:43 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, Gumdrop, we're at 130.
096:56:46 McDivitt (onboard): MARK.
096:56:47 Scott (onboard): Roger; [garble].
096:56:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, if we don't get ignition, what do we do?
096:56:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): If we don't get ignition, I'm going to start thrusting. You come on with the ascent interconnects.
096:56:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Are you going to turn the ENGINE ARM off first?
096:56:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I'll do that.
096:56:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, thank you. (Laughter) I can see us getting all of it, boom, boom.
096:57:04 Scott (onboard): Roger, Spider. Gumdrop's right with you and ready to support.
096:57:07 McDivitt (onboard): Very good.
096:57:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 1 minute.
096:57:16 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
096:57:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Tape on?
096:57:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Tape is on.
096:57:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:57:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): AVERAGE-G is ON.
096:57:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:58:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Get the ullage. There goes the burn. Burn is over.
096:58:22 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
096:58:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 2.4 - minus 2.4, plus 0.8, and plus 1, plus 0.1.
096:58:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, the residuals are zero.
096:58:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, are we safe? VERB 95 - let's see. Have you gone to P00, yet?
096:59:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
096:59:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
096:59:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Shoot, I'm sorry. I hadn't.
096:59:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): But I looked down there, and I thought I saw the COMP light ON, and then I went back to looking outside here.
096:59:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, ready for a CAL?
096:59:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
096:59:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): BALANCE LOADS is going CLOSE.
096:59:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Shoot, we just broke lock.
096:59:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hmm.
096:59:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, Houston, that TM CAL coming.
097:00:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): On the rendezvous radar. VERB 95, ENTER; VERB 37, ENTER; 20, ENTER. Okay.
097:00:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, Houston, CAL's up.
097:00:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): DFI, OFF now?
097:00:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): DFI, OFF. Right.
097:00:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, DFI's coming off, Houston. Probably nobody there.
097:00:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Say again.
097:00:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I said, there's probably nobody there.
097:00:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:00:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, here we go. Let's see if it's out there. This is really a good AUTO pilot. You know that?
097:00:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, it is. It really tracks nicely, doesn't it? Boy, it's right on 0.2 - 2 degrees per second. Oh, that Sun is just right.
097:01:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I wonder how we're going to be able to do our docking.
097:01:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
097:01:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, where's 2.2? Come on up there, baby.
097:01:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): There it is. Doggone thing is really working good, isn't it?
097:01:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Sure is. Look at that. Here.
097:01:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, that's good, huh?
097:01:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's good.
097:02:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you can debrief the burn, by the way.
097:02:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, just a second.
097:02:02 McDivitt (onboard): Gumdrop, is that how you [garble] them?
097:02:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You got all your data?
097:02:04 Scott (onboard): [Garble].
097:02:05 Scott (Spider onboard): Roger, got it all.
097:02:07 Scott (onboard): Okay, we [garble] along here [garble].
097:02:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, we're milling along here, locked on you again. Okay, that burn - You feel the ullage come on, and it was a lot more effective with just the ascent stage on.
097:02:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Sure was.
097:02:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): And then, when the APS came on, it really belts you in the can, by comparison to the DPS. It starts, it stops, and it's all over with before you even know what the heck happened. I thought I saw a big pitch attitude, but I don't know what I saw.
097:02:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): (Laughter) I don't know why. I agree with you. I don't know what the hell is going on.
097:02:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
097:02:51 Scott (onboard): [Garble] a meteor [garble].
097:02:52 Scott (Spider onboard): You're on the beam there. I got you.
097:02:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, Buddy, am I glad to hear that!
097:02:55 Scott (Spider onboard): I am, too. And listen, it's great.
097:02:56 Scott (onboard): [Garble]. You're about [garble] 1 degree from the center of the sextant.
This is Apollo Control at 97 hours, 2 minutes and we are standing by to acquire at the Redstone; find out how this CDH burn has gone. There is supposed to be another retrograde burn using the ascent propulsion system for the first time. We should be acquiring momentarily; we'll stand by.
REDSTONE (REV 61)
097:03:00 McDivitt (Spider): Attaboy. Remember that beer we were talking about the other night? I'll buy you one, Dave. [Pause]
097:03:04 Scott (Spider onboard): Roger.
097:03:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'll buy you one, babe.
097:03:08 Scott (onboard): Okay.
097:03:10 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, Houston standing by. How did it go?
097:03:15 McDivitt (Spider): Well, it's sort of a kick in the fanny by comparison to the DPS, but it went all right. Good friend over there in the Gumdrop can see me again. I'm off at daylight.
097:03:27 Roosa: Very good. Understand. [Pause]
097:03:31 Scott (onboard): Houston, Gumdrop.
097:03:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Houston, Gumdrop calling.
097:03:41 Roosa: Spider, Houston. We are still showing the APS ARMED. Can you verify that?
097:03:47 Scott (Gumdrop): Oh, gee.
097:03:50 McDivitt (Spider): Yes. Thank you very much. Thank you, Houston.
097:03:53 Roosa: Roger. You're welcome. [Pause]
That was Jim McDivitt describing that APS burn.
097:03:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Shoot, that's the only thing we had to do on ENGINE ARM, OFF, too.
097:03:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I - I still didn't hear much noise on that one. Did you?
097:04:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, no.
097:04:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Very little noise.
097:04:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I wonder if we ought to pull the A ...
097:04:06 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. Did you burn the solution that I heard you pass to Gumdrop?
097:04:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ... AELD circuit breakers.
097:04:13 McDivitt (Spider): I burned the PGNCS solution, which is the one that I passed to Gumdrop.
097:04:18 Roosa: Very good. Understand you burned it and on the time.
097:04:22 McDivitt (Spider): That's affirmative. [Long pause]
097:04:27 Scott (Spider onboard): Houston, Gumdrop.
097:04:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, let's start doing some updating into that old ACS here, and see if we can [garble] that son of a gun running.
097:04:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
097:04:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, it's really going to be tough to do this, Rusty. This thing's got so much control, I don't know what to do with it.
097:04:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, I know. Gumdrop, why don't you give me your message, and we'll relay it to them.
097:04:47 Scott (Gumdrop): [Garble] I don't know.
097:04:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey ...
097:04:49 McDivitt (Spider): Gumdrop, why don't you give me your message, and we will relay it to them.
097:04:50 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble] tell them where - were - was and how I [garble] but I guess you told them that. That's alright.
097:04:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You ready?
097:04:56 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Wait just a minute.
Long comm break.
097:04:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, yes we do. Yes.
097:04:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, I stopped that one there. Come on you. That other one's hanging there, and we have to scrunch down a little low to make it look like it. Oh shoot, it's drifting out.
Showing range 75 and a half miles closing at 107 feet per second.
097:05:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Now, I don't know, but when it - when we had these things zeroed, the needle was over here on the side. I don't know where to put it.
097:05:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'm just going to put it in the middle. Heck with it. Okay, that's good 75 miles right?
097:05:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right.
097:05:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
097:05:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CLEAR 316, plus 00750, ENTER.
097:05:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'm going to take my helmet off and get a drink.
097:05:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And I want to do a VERB 93, ENTER; and a VERB 32, ENTER.
097:06:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, why don't we pull the AELD circuit breaker?
097:06:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You don't trust this engine?
097:06:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, but why do we keep it up?
097:06:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Because we don't give any more ignition signals or anything, for one thing.
097:06:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, as a matter, of fact, we're going to leave the tape running here. That's right. So we already got one mark into the radar, I mean into the AGS and [garble].
097:06:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): (Laughter) Hey, look what I had on inside my helmet.
097:07:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I know. I saw that.
097:07:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): (Laughter)
097:07:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Boy, it's taking a long while.
097:07:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): There it is - 97:57: ...
097:07:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Push the NOMINAL, quick.
097:07:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... 56. Hold on. Okay. 97:57:56. Stand by, I'll check with the - the NOMINAL was 97:56:23.
These range/range/rate readings are off the Spider's rendezvous radar.
097:08:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
097:08:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 97:56:23, 97:56:23.
097:08:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, ready for another mark there.
097:08:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, shoot, I knew you would be.
097:08:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Man, that sun is really bright.
097:08:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, you ought to pull up your shade.
097:09:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
097:09:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Mark. 71 miles. Right on the money. 316, CLEAR. 316, plus 00710, ENTER. Okay, 065, [garble] that says 112.9, 21.7, 27.9.
097:09:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, there's Baja down there.
097:09:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): There's plus 7, plus 0.3, minus 0.2. Look at that. That's beautiful.
097:09:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Hang in there, baby. Another couple of hours. Then I'll have you home.
097:09:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, that's STOP, RESET, and a down, and there's -
097:10:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's close.
097:10:45 McDivitt (Spider): And, Gumdrop, Spider. Anytime you want to check your range or range rate, just let us know.
097:10:52 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Stand by.
Comm break.
097:11:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's see, we have the VERB 93 in, don't we?
097:11:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:11:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 3 [garble] marks. Okay, ready for another one?
097:11:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Ready.
097:11:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Actually, there's no big rush, but that's okay.
097:11:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
097:11:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Mark. 69 point - or 68.5.
097:11:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): See how it's doing. 114 feet per second. That's not very good. And range is 67.8. That's pretty good, not too bad.
097:12:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
097:12:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It takes a few more before the range rate starts coming in.
097:12:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:12:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Let's see how our astronaut one is doing there. That looks good. That looks good.
097:12:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Ohhhh.
097:12:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That scared you?
097:12:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): (Laughter)
097:12:51 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, Spider.
097:12:55 Roosa: Go, Spider. This is Houston.
097:12:57 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Onboard RCS 82 and 75.
097:13:03 Roosa: Roger. Copy. Thank you very much, Spider. [Long pause]
097:13:24 Scott (Gumdrop): Spider, Gumdrop.
097:13:26 McDivitt (Spider): Go ahead, Gumdrop.
097:13:28 Scott (Gumdrop): I've got 67 miles and 112 feet per second.
097:13:32 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. We have 67 miles and 107 feet per second.
097:13:37 Scott (Gumdrop): How about that.
097:13:38 McDivitt (Spider): Now wait a second; you're still 5 feet per second off. You're going to have to shape that up.
097:13:42 Scott (Gumdrop): Well, let me take some more Marks and I'll get it squared away.
097:13:44 McDivitt (Spider): Right.
Long comm break.
097:13:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
097:13:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Jees, you just never give up.
097:13:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We'll - I'm going to get this AGS going here.
097:13:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): (Laughter) See that red light up there (laughter).
097:14:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:14:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, that's really a lot that you're doing.
097:14:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, it's not too bad.
097:14:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Take my [garble].
097:14:13 Unidentifiable crewmember: (Yawn)
097:14:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Let's see how our rendezvous radar temperature's doing; it's 95 degrees. You're going to be a whiles ahead. 95 and 97.14.
097:14:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, I'm plotting these things all wrong. I thought that that was 86. 86 is down here. Okay, we're right on the curve.
097:14:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Good.
097:15:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You coming in there, Tiger?
097:15:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Tell you what, to hurry up - spend a little fuel now, and save some later.
097:15:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): How you going to save some later?
Spider has a radar. Dave Scott in Gumdrop is coming up with his range rate information optically through the sextant.
097:15:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, what I was going to do, is going to take a mark, here, and stop playing horsearound.
097:15:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, -
097:15:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
097:15:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Mark. 64.2.
097:15:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Coming in. Good.
097:15:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Is there anything else we need to do along here?
097:16:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No. Until we get to 45 miles.
097:16:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 10 marks, we're going to do a recycle. 10 marks, have we done that? No, we haven't done that yet.
And Spider is in the next to the last portion of what the flight controllers call the bubble or the ashcan. It's so named because of its appearance on a relative motion plot. We've had the mini football, the football - we're in the bubble now.
097:17:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Want me to turn that over?
097:17:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, yes, I guess so.
097:17:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Soon as that pitch needle dribbles up there we'll be on.
097:17:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Dribbling slowly.
097:17:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Shoot, what did it do, stop dribbling?
097:17:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Sure did.
097:17:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Just a minute, now [garble].
097:17:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey ...
097:17:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
097:18:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Mark 62.1.
097:18:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I think I'll put in a range rate here.
097:18:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oops. Let me get over here.
097:18:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, what is it? 107 and a ...
097:18:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:18:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
097:18:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 10 marks, and I'll recycle.
This is Apollo Control. Gumdrop's orbit has not changed since the separation maneuver which he performed. He is still in a 127 by 122 nautical mile orbit.
097:19:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Tape, just for your information, the AGS - on occasion here, I clear it when I - when I hit the CLEAR button, I get an OPERATOR ERROR. And I've had to hit CLEAR several times consecutively in order to keep the OPERATOR ERRORS off.
097:19:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Boy, we really do look coelliptic.
097:20:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Do we?
097:20:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, it's been hanging right in 107, you know. Yes, the range rate.
097:20:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's the way we like them.
097:20:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right.
097:20:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Nominal is 19.8 and 11.2. Okay, there we are with our time.
097:20:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 97:57:33. So, we're 1 minute late. That's the way to be.
097:21:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Better late than never, huh?
097:21:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:21:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Boy, that Sun is really bright.
097:21:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:21:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's not the Sun, I guess; it's just the Earth.
097:21:20 McDivitt (Spider): Gumdrop, Spider. For you information, we've got a TPI time. It's 1 minute late right now.
097:21:26 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. I've got a couple of solutions and I've got 98 03 and 98 04.
097:21:32 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. 97 57 33.
097:21:39 Scott (Gumdrop): 97 57 33. Okay.
Comm break.
097:21:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's pretty stable, boy.
097:21:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Um. I wonder what they're thinking about in there?
097:21:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I don't know, but it takes a while, doesn't it?
097:21:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, it sure does. We may have some trouble getting through that thing for TPI. You notice all this perigee torquing and gyro dynamics that we're getting and - (laughter) You've been steady as a rock all day.
097:22:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, I sure have.
097:22:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Did you ever get the AGS all lined up and everything?
097:22:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, let me set the time again. I've got to take another series here.
CANARY (REV 62)
097:23:37 Roosa: And, Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston. I have a ground solution when you are ready to copy.
097:23:42 McDivitt (Spider): Spider here. Just a moment.
097:23:13 Scott (Spider onboard): Gumdrop's ready.
097:23:43 Roosa: Roger. We're going to have you in contact for about another 12 minutes.
097:23:47 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Spider is here. Ready to copy.
097:23:53 Roosa: Roger, Spider. Can you take it now, Gumdrop?
097:23:57 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. All set. Go ahead. [Pause]
097:24:09 Roosa: Roger. Reading TPI: 097 57 4500, plus 196, plus 001, minus 105 223, no roll or pitch, 2670, minus 1010; forward 223 all zips, up 003. End of update.
097:24:36 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. Understand. 097 57 4500, plus 196, plus 001, minus 105 223 zips and zips 2670, minus 1010, forward 223 zips, and up 003. And did you count our DSKY on our last recycle?
097:25:03 Roosa: That is affirmative. Spider. Looks like we're shaping up.
097:25:08 McDivitt (Spider): Looks that way.
097:25:10 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop. Copy.
097:25:12 Roosa: Roger, Gumdrop.
Comm break.
Range 55 miles, range rate 107 per second.
097:25:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble]. You and the UP/DOWN component.
097:25:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): (Laughter) Yes. Not, bad, huh? How does - how do the times agree?
097:25:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Within - 12 seconds off.
097:25:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 12 seconds. That's not bad. I'll take it.
097:25:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It's the best sim we've run.
097:25:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, ready for some more AGS stuff.
097:25:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, good. I'm almost lined up.
097:26:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, hell. We're going to have to get this one done on the fly. Stand by; stand by; stand by.
097:26:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
097:26:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 53.0. Okay.
097:26:51 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, that was our last update. We are going to GO with that PAD. [Pause]
097:27:00 McDivitt (Spider): Spider here. Roger.
097:27:01 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop. Roger
097:27:06 Schweickart (Spider): Hey, Smokey, is Dave Reed smiling?
097:27:09 Roosa: Well - yes; he's pretty happy, but he's not going to relax until you've finished burning.
097:27:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): He'd...
097:27:17 Schweickart (Spider): Better not. [Long pause]
097:27:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We may need that two-burn solution yet. (laughter)
097:27:47 McDivitt (Spider): Gumdrop, Spider.
097:27:50 Scott (Gumdrop): Go ahead.
097:27:51 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. As soon as we get into the dark, give me a look-see. If you don't see any tracking light which I guess you won't - we'll put the docking lights on and you might be able to get a Mark on those.
097:28:01 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Might be able to do that at that range.
097:28:04 Schweickart (Spider): Right.
097:28:07 Schweickart (Spider): At that range with that big eyeball you've got.
097:28:09 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger.
Comm break.
That conversation was between Rusty Schweickart and Dave Scott. Dave Reed is the Flight Dynamics Officer on the white team.
097:28:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay?
097:28:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, with that docking - undocking episode we had ...
097:28:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Ready?
097:28:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): All set.
097:28:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
097:28:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Mark, 50.3.
097:29:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): For that little undocking episode - We're supposed to do a recycle at 16 minutes. I don't know if we want to or not.
097:29:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No.
097:29:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Do you want to skip it? I mean at the 17 marks?
097:29:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, let's go in a little closer and do one more recycle.
097:29:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Two? We've only got 14 more minutes, and it takes us 4 minutes to get one.
097:29:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, okay, let's do it now.
097:29:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. I'm wondering whether we ought to just maybe forego that - those DTO's.
097:29:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, that's what I was thinking. I think we ought to get up there and move around a little bit and say, "Okay, let's dock.
097:29:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:29:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): See what's going to happen. He doesn't have a spotlight.
097:29:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): He doesn't have a spotlight; your COAS doesn't work too well ...
097:29:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I can't - I ...
097:29:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... we don't know about that docking probe.
097:29:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'll bet you 2 bits that I can't even dock. I bet you he's going to have to end up doing the docking.
097:29:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And we'll thrust at him.
097:30:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I want to reset the DAP when we get in here a little closer. Guess maybe I could do that right now. When we're - wait until I finish this recycle, though. Load up and put the A system on align.
097:30:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 97 - Oh, look at that, would you?
097:30:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Where? How far off are we now?
097:30:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right there. No, it's up there.
097:30:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 4 seconds.
097:30:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Matter of fact, I guess this is as good a time to discuss this with Houston as not.
097:31:04 McDivitt (Spider): Houston, this is Spider.
097:31:05 Roosa: Go, Spider. This is Houston, here.
097:31:08 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. Concerning the episode we had coming off the probe, and some little VTO's, we have had after we get back up there, I think it might be wise to go ahead and dock when we get there without waiting until almost dark. [Pause]
097:31:26 Roosa: Roger, Spider. We copy, and sounds like a pretty good idea.
097:31:32 McDivitt (Spider): Why don't you go through those VTO's and see if there is anything that's really important there, and if so we'll try to get it for you, but otherwise I think we might see if that probe is going to work.
097:31:41 Roosa: Roger. Understand. We've got that in work.
Comm break.
097:32:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What was it? Just right?
097:32:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 0.3 of a foot per second off there. How about a 415 here?
097:32:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, stand by 1.
097:32:45 Scott (Gumdrop): Spider, Gumdrop.
097:32:47 McDivitt (Spider): Go ahead. Gumdrop, Spider.
097:32:48 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Mine's conversion now. I've got 9758 on my current solution.
097:32:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Good show.
097:32:55 McDivitt (Spider): Very good; very good. Ours is now within about 3.7 seconds of the ground's.
097:32:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): The last one was 97.
097:32:58 McDivitt (Spider): 5741, I think.
097:33:01 Scott (Gumdrop): I've got 97 58 19.
097:33:05 McDivitt (Spider): Okay; very good. Sounds like we'll all be together then. [Pause]
097:33:12 Scott (Gumdrop): How about that? [Long pause]
097:33:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you ready?
097:33:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No. I got distracted. Okay, stank by.
097:33:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
097:33:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Mark. 45.8.
097:33:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We can expect getting in another plot pretty soon.
097:33:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right, I'm ready for it.
097:33:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Over Africa, there.
097:33:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): In fact, we can get it right now, if you want to get one pitch up PULSE.
097:33:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right there.
097:33:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
097:33:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And that's 45.0, huh?
097:33:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right.
097:34:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's 12.22.
097:34:09 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston. We're about a minute or so LOS from Canaries. There is an ARIA, if you need it, up to about 42; we'll see you at Carnarvon at 06, and Dave Reed is smiling now. We might catch you at Tananarive at 49, but we haven't had much luck yet. [Pause]
097:34:33 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. [Long pause]
097:34:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): See our point?
097:34:48 Roosa: And, Spider, this is Houston. Did you - Did either vehicle read over Tananarive the last pass when we were calling? [Long ause]
097:34:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh boy, I don't remember.
097:35:00 McDivitt (Spider): Houston, this is Spider. I don't remember. We've been over so many stations so many times, I couldn't tell you.
097:35:08 Roosa: Okay. It was at around CSI, right - immediately after your CSI burn.
097:35:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Roger.
097:35:14 McDivitt (Spider): I read you twice, but it was pretty bad.
097:35:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, we did.
097:35:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Alright.
097:35:18 Schweickart (Spider): We called the [garble]...
097:35:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ...CDH time...
097:35:20 Schweickart (Spider): ...down to you, too, but didn't get any reply.
097:35:23 Roosa: Okay. Thank you.
097:35:27 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop doesn't remember whether he heard you or not.
097:35:31 Roosa: Okay.
Long comm break.
097:35:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, a couple more of these ...
097:35:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What do you want? You want one of those marks, that's what I'm getting for you.
097:35:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, another one of these marks.
097:35:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, you fink head.
097:35:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
097:35:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Mark. 43.2.
097:35:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, let me get in here with this VERB 48. I'll read that. VERB 48, ENTER; VERB 21, ENTER.
This is Apollo Control 97 hours 36 minutes. We've had LOS at Canaries. Long pass there, in which we got the word that the CDH maneuver went very well. Gumdrop has reacquired Spider visually. We got an onboard reading from the reaction control system, 82 percent in system A, 75 percent in system B. And as we lost signal at Canaries, we were showing the range at 46-1/2 miles, range rate of 105 feet per second and closing. Jim McDivitt and Rusty Schweickart continuing to feed radar information into the Spider computer, continuing to update their solutions for the terminal phase initiation of this rendezvous. And as they progress on this, they are coming closer and closer to the ground solution. We passed up a pad for TPI, showing time of ignition 97 hours 57 minutes 45 seconds. At that time the onboard solution was reading 975733, just prior to LOS. They called out a new solution showing 975741. This was in conversation between - air-to-air conversation between the two vehicles. The ground pad delta V 22.3, the last solution onboard 21.7 feet per second. Spider will continue to update the solution until shortly before he burns. We probably won't know which solution he went with until after the burn, but it looks like they're both going to be - that the onboard solution is going to agree very closely to the ground solution. This TPI burn, the times both ground-based and onboard, place the burn just after loss of signal at Tananarive. That is the next station to acquire. Whether we will be able to get good communications through Tananarive is doubtful, but we will come up and stand by. Throughout this rendezvous, the flight surgeons have been monitoring just one pilot, and that's the - stand by just a minute.
097:36:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, let me pitch up one PULSE here.
097:36:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, go. Let's see. Zero, 2 JET A. Zero zero ...
097:36:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We're hold at 42-5.
097:36:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ... zero zero, zero zero.
097:36:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 42.5.
097:36:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'm rolling. 2 JET A, define ACA, 0.3 of a degree DEADBAND, and 2 degrees per second. Alright. PRO; VERB 34, ENTER.
097:36:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It getting dark?
097:36:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, not really.
097:37:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Let me open up my simulator window here. I'd like to see part of this rendezvous.
097:37:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Which part? (Laughter)
097:37:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): The finish.
097:37:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Wonder if we can see him out there?
097:37:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Depends on what the temperature of the clouds is. Oh, they're way down.
097:37:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I can see him, I think.
097:37:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Look at the landing data -
097:37:25 McDivitt (onboard): Say, Davey, I think I see you again!
097:37:28 Scott (onboard): Oh, very good.
097:37:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I do see him.
097:37:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we're at 100 ...
097:37:34 McDivitt (onboard): Boy, I'll tell you, you're awful small.
097:37:37 Scott (onboard): I don't doubt that at all. We're still out at 41 miles.
097:37:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 97:40.
097:37:46 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, and, as a matter of fact, you're fading on me.
097:37:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we're below the line, Jim.
097:37:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Are we really?
097:37:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, on the radar temperature.
097:38:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, boy ...
097:38:01 McDivitt (onboard): Now I've got you again. You're going through the horizon, right now.
097:38:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): On the radar.
097:38:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I'm sorry.
097:38:11 Scott (onboard): Okay.
097:38:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Where are you going, huh?
097:38:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Where am I going?
097:38:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:38:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Where am I going?
097:38:25 Scott (onboard): Spider, Gumdrop. Will you have your final solution before, like about a minute?
097:38:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, are we pitching up - excuse me.
097:38:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No.
097:38:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'm sorry, I thought we were pitching up. I had looked out the window, and I saw us way up in the air here.
097:38:30 McDivitt (onboard): I hope so, Dave.
097:38:32 Scott (onboard): Okay. Just to remind you that I'd like your time as soon as you get it.
097:38:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No.
097:38:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, there he is. By George. Okay, how about another mark here?
097:38:36 McDivitt (onboard): Yes, we're going to proceed at 14 minutes, and then we'll give it to you as soon as it comes up, which should be in about a minute or 2.
097:38:43 Scott (onboard): Okay, thank you.
That's the Lunar Moudle Pilot Rusty Schweickart. His heart rate has been running between 58 and 70 with the majority of the times down toward the lower figure. You heard Jim McDivitt talk; we have ARIA in here; we may come up anytime, if we hear the call, we'll come back up. You heard Jim McDivitt talking about the possiblity of docking as soon as they rendezvous instead of station keeping for a number of minutes - the flight plan calls out that they'll station keep and then dock just prior to darkness. However, in view of the little problem they had in the undocking where the capture latches seemed to hang up for awhile in the probe, Jim would like to go ahead and dock right away in case there is any trouble, he wants to have some daylight left to continue the attempt - he wouldn't like to go into darkness right after the first attempted docking if it wasn't successful. Tananarive will acquire at 97 hours, 49 minutes, about 9 - 8 minutes from now. 8 minutes away. We'll come back up then. And if we do acquire through the ARIA, we'll come back earlier. This is Mission Control Houston.
097:38:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What kind? A radar for the AGS or radar for the chart?
097:38:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, I think we did a chart one last, so we'll do a AGS one here.
097:38:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
097:39:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, stand by.
097:39:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
097:39:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, hell.
097:39:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
097:39:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Mark, 39.5.
097:39:25 Scott (Spider onboard): Spider, Gumdrop. Will you have your final solution before, like about a minute?
097:39:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I hope so, Dave.
097:39:32 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, just to remind you that I'd like your time as soon as you get it.
097:39:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, we're going to PROCEED at 14 minutes, and then we'll give it to you as soon as it comes up, which should be in about a minute or two.
097:39:43 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, thank you.
097:39:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, by the way. That time is wrong now.
097:40:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We're getting on down close to the end, aren't we?
097:40:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:40:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Got to start thinking what we are going to do. TPI. That's TPF. KEY RELEASE, 5 minutes. What am I doing over on that page?
097:40:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, can we get another one for the chart?
097:40:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Sure.
097:40:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, stand by.
097:40:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
097:40:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, it's right on the money, 38 miles and 14.4. 38, I said? Yes, 33 and 14.4.
097:41:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Very good.
097:41:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Boy, I need to blow my nose.
097:41:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, me too. I've had a head full. That Actifed sort of helped me at night, though.
097:41:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Scratch that thing.
097:42:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay ...
097:42:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay [garble] here.
097:42:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We've got our last radar warning lights on. Okay, last AGS mark.
097:42:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, AGS mark, okay?
097:42:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] I mark.
ARIA (REV 62)
097:42:49 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay, Spider. I still have you against the Earth background.
097:42:52 Schweickart (Spider): Great. [Pause]
097:42:57 Scott (Gumdrop): This thing is really tracking.
097:43:00 Schweickart (Spider): Do you have a light?
097:43:02 Scott (Gumdrop): No. It's still daylight to me; you're little black spots; dark on a light background. [Pause]
097:43:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, stand by.
097:43:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
097:43:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Mark, 35.8.
097:43:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
097:43:17 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. We've got about 1425 now.
097:43:20 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Long pause]
097:43:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 503 minus 00104, ENTER. Okay.
097:43:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Throw in that one last mark.
097:43:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Put that on here.
097:43:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, on here.
097:43:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, yes. Oh, okay. Let's get one more on the chart here, since you're close.
097:44:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Soon as that time comes up, why don't you give ol' Davey a call. There it is, right there.
097:44:18 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Gumdrop, this is Spider. Our time - ready to copy?
097:44:23 Scott (Gumdrop): Go ahead. [Pause]
097:44:28 McDivitt (Spider): Gumdrop, are you ready?
097:44:31 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Standing by. Go ahead and read it.
097:44:33 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. 97:57:79.
097:44:40 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay; good. My last time vas 97:58:08.
097:44:46 McDivitt (Spider): Roger.
097:44:47 Scott (Gumdrop): That's great. [Pause]
097:44:56 Schweickart (onboard): Where do you stand now?
097:44:57 Scott (Gumdrop): Ready [garble] staying in there. [Garble] my mode for a 4 [garble] for a 304 read. I want it for a plus point.
097:45:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What are you looking for now? You looking for ...
097:45:04 Schweickart (onboard): What I'm - I'm looking for - a 40- for a 304 re - I'm looking for a plot point.
097:45:05 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. It's 31.9 no - 34 miles - 3.9. [Pause]
097:45:09 McDivitt (onboard): Right there.
097:45:10 McDivitt (onboard): MARK.
097:45:11 Scott (onboard): Hot mike.
097:45:12 Schweickart (onboard): Hold. Okay, it's 31.9 - 32 - 34 markup.
097:45:19 McDivitt (onboard): 33.9, yes.
097:45:20 Scott (onboard): Hot mike.
097:45:22 McDivitt (Spider): All right. Okay? [Long pause]
097:45:28 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble] plus 60.
097:45:42 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. We're right on the plot. [Long pause]
097:45:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
097:45:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Alrighty. There we go.
097:45:54 Schweickart (onboard): 11 [garble] 7 [garble] 081 is - Why don't you call in to him?
097:45:59 Scott (Gumdrop): Seven... [Pause]
097:46:04 McDivitt (Spider): I don't know; 81 and - unless you call into them.
097:46:10 McDivitt (Spider): Dave, here are our DELTA-V's.
097:46:13 Scott (Gumdrop): Good. I'm ready to copy.
097:46:14 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Plus 19.4, plus 0.4, minus 9.7. [Pause]
097:46:24 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Plus 19.4, plus 0.4, minus 9.7.
097:46:31 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. That's correct.
097:46:33 Scott (Gumdrop): Good. [Pause]
097:46:39 Scott (Gumdrop): Good. Do you want to compare now?
097:46:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, how do they look?
097:46:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Where are they?
097:46:45 McDivitt (Spider): 19.4; I got 19.6.
097:46:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, there they are; 19.4, 19.6.
097:46:50 Scott (Gumdrop): Hello. Spider. Gumdrop.
097:46:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, that's great.
097:46:53 McDivitt (Spider): Go ahead, Gumdrop.
097:46:54 Scott (Gumdrop): You got a...
Long comm break.
097:46:55 Scott (onboard): ...a hot mike, and also my elevation angle on your time is 27.32.
097:46:59 McDivitt (onboard): Great.
This is Apollo Control at 97 hours 46 minutes and we are picking up some air to air conversation between Gumdrop and Spider through this ARIA. We will come up with that now and then go on into the Tananarive pass.
097:47:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I want to set the DET; stop, DOWN.
097:47:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay [garble].
097:47:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, we can go on to a P00 and update the AGS. PRO. P00.
097:47:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'm - I want to - first I want to get the AGS solution here.
097:47:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, fine. And we've got an 8-minute mark for you, too, in here. Oops, where the hell did he go? Oh, there he is. I see him.
097:47:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You got him?
097:47:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:47:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'm going to be ready in just a second.
097:47:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, fine. Oh, the Moon is going to be out there.
097:48:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
097:48:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble].
097:48:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): CLEAR 303. Read, 23.46. CLEAR 257. Read -
097:48:17 McDivitt (onboard): Dave, just as a matter of interest, the Moon has just come up, and it's going to be shining right on our front face, so maybe you'll be able to track us in the moonlight.
097:48:25 Scott (onboard): Great!
097:48:26 McDivitt (onboard): And I also got [garble].
097:48:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Can he still see us?
097:48:28 McDivitt (onboard): I'll go to docking lights for you at this time, since we don't have a light.
097:48:32 Scott (onboard): Okay. Here's my answer to your time. 19.4, 0, and 8.8.
097:48:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'm ready for the update.
097:48:41 Schweickart (onboard): Great!
097:48:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You ready?
097:48:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Ready. Okay, I m ready for the 8-minute mark.
097:48:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
097:48:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I got the update.
097:49:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Gee, these marks are going to be a lot more ragged than you've been getting.
097:49:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 100 feet per second, yes - CLEAR 3 - 101 that is.
097:49:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:49:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
097:49:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, mine was 130.1, Okay?
097:49:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:49:16 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] 400 plus ...
097:49:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hey, what happened here?
097:49:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Huh?
097:49:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What are we doing?
097:49:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): What?
097:49:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We just lost - Oh, there we go - Oh, we were doing that. Okay.
097:49:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I hope not.
097:49:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That old thing. We just lost the control system there.
097:49:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, yes.
097:49:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I keep forgetting that AGS update does that. That was a bad time with me. Okay, we're 20 seconds to go here.
097:49:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Damn alignment isn't that good. Okay. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
097:50:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
097:50:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): What have you got there, 29.5 and [garble].
097:50:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 29.5, right - 28.5.
TANANARIVE (REV 62)
097:50:05 Roosa: Spider and Gumdrop, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by. I did copy your final solution; sounds great.
097:50:13 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. Spider. [Long pause]
097:50:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That was 28.5, Rusty.
097:50:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I got it.
097:50:16 Scott (onboard): Gumdrop.
097:50:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, fine. Okay, I'm going to 41 now.
097:50:23 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, 20.5.
097:50:24 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 37 [garble] 44 -
097:50:26 Roosa: Spider, Houston. The only one I wasn't sure of was your DELTA-VX. I read it as 197.
Long comm break.
097:50:36 McDivitt (onboard): I think it was 194; I'll have to check. Just a minute.
097:50:39 Scott (onboard): 19.4, Smokey.
097:50:50 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Did you want anything out of here?
097:50:52 Schweickart (Spider onboard): NOUN 86, yes. I need a NOUN 86. Okay, and that's plus 19.4, plus 0.4, and minus 9.7. Okay, you can KEY RELEASE on that. Okay. CLEAR, and remind me of the 5-minute mark.
097:51:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right. I've got my eye on it.
097:51:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Shoot, I've lost it again. Can't see with all the lights up so bright.
097:51:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): There's nothing out there I need to look at. Oh, I know, he's going to the other attitude. Getting drowsy. Oh, shoot, we're going to lose lock on him.
097:52:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I hope not. Call me on that 5 minutes.
097:52:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, you've got 40 seconds. Yes, he's turned around. We're going to be lucky if we hold lock. It's coming back up now a little.
097:52:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Shoot, that elevation angle [garble] very high.
097:52:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 11 seconds.
097:52:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): So you have 5 seconds to go.
097:52:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 4, 3, 2, 1 -
097:53:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
097:53:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 26.1 - 26.0 and 99.
097:53:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, go over to the other side here.
097:53:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 2208, KEY RELEASE.
097:53:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, let's see. We got that. 5 minutes. I'm going to VERB 77 here.
097:53:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
097:53:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 77, ENTER.
097:54:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I got a DOWN 1.
097:54:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Where's the next time we do an ORDEAL update? Maybe I'd better do it here; guess I better. Let's see, VERB 83, ENTER.
097:54:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I got a 420 and DOWN 1.
097:54:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Going down to the [garble]. That's 24, 45.53, 25.9. How does it compare, Rusty?
097:55:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Compares good, within a foot per second.
097:55:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Great.
097:55:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, how much time we got?
097:55:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 2 left.
097:55:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 2 minutes? That's some kind of a world's record.
097:55:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, let's see what else we have to do here. Copy our angle [garble], verify the burn attitude, compare PGNS and AGS attitude errors. I don't see him out there. I'm sure he's turned around.
097:55:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, the radar sees him.
097:55:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. 0.05 -
097:55:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, how's your burn attitude? Boy, look at that; we're even on this.
097:56:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:56:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): The old REFSMMAT came through, huh?
097:56:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, yes. We're on over there, aren't we?
097:56:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. Okay, AVERAGE G's coming ON; I'm monitoring on the AGS here.
097:56:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, I'm just going to burn it out straight ahead.
097:56:17 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston. We will see you over Carnarvon at 06.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, 97 hours, 56 minutes. We have LOS at Tananarive and we're less than a minute away from the burn. The final onboard solution - ignition time 97:57:59 - about 21 and one-half feet per second. We'll find out at Carnarvon about this burn. This is the Terminal Phase Initiation - the one that will put us on a course to intercept the Command Module. There are two points following this burn at which we - at which Spider can make midcourse corrections if needed. One at 11 minutes after the burn - the other one about 22 minutes after the burn. We expect Carnarvon acquisition at 98 hours, 5 minutes. We'll come back up then and find out how the TPI went. This is Mission Control Houston.
097:56:22 McDivitt (onboard): Roger.
097:56:24 Scott (onboard): Spider, Gumdrop. Coming up to 133 now, and ready to support.
097:56:29 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, I was right with you.
097:56:31 Scott (onboard): Okay.
097:56:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] call something, huh?
097:56:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:56:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Good, I like it that way.
097:56:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): The other DAP's set in now, right?
097:56:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right.
097:56:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Change SYSTEM A. Okay?
097:56:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Works like a charm ...
097:56:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Boy, and he's right on top of old Scorpio.
097:57:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I don't see him out there. Oh, yes, I saw him then. Okay, he's right where he's supposed to be.
097:57:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, the stars are exactly where they were in the simulator.
097:57:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, the Moon wasn't there, though.
097:57:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:57:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Do you know ...
097:57:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] the time of this burn, by chance?
097:57:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No.
097:57:32 McDivitt (onboard): AVERAGE g is ON.
097:57:33 Schweickart (onboard): Right.
097:57:50 McDivitt (onboard): About 10 seconds.
097:57:52 Scott (onboard): Roger.
097:57:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
097:58:02 McDivitt (onboard): Thrusting.
097:58:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Boy, it looks like the 4th of July, doesn't it?
097:58:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
097:58:16 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, we're getting it in slowly here.
097:58:18 Scott (onboard): Good.
097:58:25 McDivitt (onboard): You ought to be able to see it; it looks like the Fourth of July.
097:58:28 Scott (onboard): I can. I can see you perfectly.
097:58:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we're going to go to P00 as soon as you're done.
097:58:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, just a second now.
097:58:45 Scott (onboard): How'd you do?
097:58:48 Schweickart (onboard): Looks good.
097:58:50 Scott (onboard): Okay.
097:58:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 6.
097:58:53 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, we had all zips when we went.
097:58:55 Scott (onboard): Good.
097:58:59 McDivitt (onboard): There's two. Okay. Okay, coming to the next side here. Okay, VERB 93, ENTER, right away.
097:59:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I need a 76, EATS.
097:59:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... ENTER, right away.
097:59:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): VERB 76 ...
097:59:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay?
097:59:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ENTER.
097:59:11 Scott (onboard): Okay, and I'll get that other.
097:59:14 McDivitt (onboard): VERB 93, ENTER.
097:59:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 3, right. ENTER. ...
097:59:16 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, VERB 37, ENTER; 20, ENTER. Did we ever break lock?
097:59:22 Schweickart (onboard): No.
097:59:23 Scott (onboard): Hot mike.
097:59:29 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, I'm going to bypass the maneuver.
097:59:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's see, we're at 20 miles -
097:59:34 Scott (onboard): Hot mike.
097:59:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ... 20 miles.
097:59:35 McDivitt (onboard): Thank you.
097:59:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ... 2 points, so we're all right; makes 5- Yes, I verify he's out there. We can use a [garble].
097:59:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you veri - watch - watch [garble] in that.
097:59:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Woo. [Garble].
098:00:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Look at that. Line of sight reads what it's supposed to be. Okay, now what we have to do - we have to do a 93 and a 20, bypass the AUTO maneuver, 35 - we've got that up working - set the DET, copy the angle for the charts, at 5 minutes.
098:00:47 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Okay, and I've got - you got 22 FORWARD on that, which is just right, and zero there. Fantastic! The AGS said you did just right.
098:01:08 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Good old AGS.
098:01:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Good old AGS and count DELTA-V pretty good. That may be all it can do, but it can do that.
098:01:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, you ready for your 5-minute mark?
098:01:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, do we want to take another plot?
098:01:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, if you'd like.
098:01:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, if you're on ...
098:01:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Sounds like a pretty good idea. Okay.
098:01:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
098:01:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, mark, and it was now - what was the ...
098:01:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 17 miles.
098:01:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... 17. Okay. 17, 32.5. There we go.
098:01:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Great. Okay, get ready for your mark.
098:02:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. I'm all ready.
098:02:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
098:03:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
098:03:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Right [garble]
098:03:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, and it was 15.9.
098:03:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right.
098:03:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And 107?
098:03:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right, yes, 107's mark. Okay, I'll just sit here, and putt along until we get to 7 minutes.
098:03:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 34.73.
098:03:22 Scott (onboard): Spider, Gumdrop. I'm afraid I just can't see you without that light.
098:03:25 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, Dave. We only ask you to do what's humanly possible.
098:03:35 Scott (onboard): Okay.
098:03:43 Scott (onboard): You're against an Earth background with a bunch of clouds which doesn't help anything.
098:03:46 Schweickart (Spider): Yes, I know it.
098:03:49 Scott (Gumdrop): Are you all set up for the docking?
098:03:51 Scott (onboard): All set.
098:03:52 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. [Long pause]
098:03:53 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, what do you think happened to the probe on the way out, Dave?
098:03:56 Scott (onboard): I'm not really sure. I think it just got hung up on the capture latches. I took a look to see if it had extended all the way, and the [garble] was in the retract position; and, when I went back up to extend the second time, you dropped right off.
098:04:08 McDivitt (onboard): I want to get on that thing as soon as possible, just in case something's wrong.
This is Apollo Control at 98 hours, 4 minutes and Gumdrop and Spider are coming up on the Carnarvon station. It's been 6 minutes, 40 seconds since TPI time. The two spacecrafts should rendezvous approximately 30 minutes after TPI, so we're in the order of 23 minutes away now. It's coming up on 7 minutes since TPI. We'll find out how that burn went when we get to Carnarvon. We have picked up very brief bits of air-to-air conversation even now before Carnarvon acquisition. We'll come on up now and give that to you and then stand by for Carnarvon.
CARNARVON (REV 62)
098:04:09 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay.
098:04:12 Schweickart (Spider): I want to get of that [garble].
098:04:14 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. [Long pause]
098:04:15 Scott (onboard): I'm with you.
098:04:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, are you on, Jim?
098:04:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I'm on - right now.
098:04:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 2, 1 -
098:04:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
098:04:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, and that was 14 - 14, and you got to hit a PROCEED here at 7.
098:04:39 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] I've got the PROCEED, [garble].
098:04:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 14, 37.4. We are right parallel to it.
098:04:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Just a tad high?
098:04:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, we're a tad high. I bet we're going to have a zero midcourse.
098:05:02 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, Dave. We're calling for our first midcourse.
Comm break.
Carnarvon has acquired now.
098:05:05 Scott (onboard): Okay.
098:05:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, and we've got you 52 seconds to get through your - do your short stuff.
098:05:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, and I need my 8-minute mark.
098:05:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 8 seconds. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
098:06:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
098:06:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That came right at it. Oh.
098:06:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And it's 12.2 and 98.
098:06:07 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, Dave. I've got our DELTA-V's for you.
098:06:10 Scott (Gumdrop): Go ahead.
098:06:11 McDivitt (Spider): X is minus 1.0, Y is 0 - is minus 0.3, and Z is plus 0.9. [Pause]
098:06:23 Scott (Spider onboard): Boy, you'd sure argue.
098:06:25 Scott (Gumdrop): Well, you can't hardly argue with that.
098:06:27 McDivitt (Spider): No, I think I'll go ahead and burn them here.
Comm break.
098:06:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You got that, Rusty?
They're discussing the first midcourse correction.
098:06:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:06:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Did you write them down at all?
098:06:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:06:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, fine.
098:06:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I get the next ones here. Aft 1.4; left 0.4; and up 1.
098:06:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 0.1.
098:06:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 0.1, yes, I got it. Okay.
098:06:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, we don't need that. I'm going to leave that,
098:06:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I'm going to turn up my [garble] here ...
098:06:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 21, ENTER; 18, ENTER, PRO.
098:07:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Boy, it reads zero.
098:07:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What does, your chart?
098:07:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): UP/DOWN, yes. Aft 4 - I'll be with you in a second.
Apollo Control, and as you heard, that was a very small correction for that first midcourse, and we thought we heard Jim McDivitt say that he was going to go ahead and burn those out.
098:07:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): VERB 77, ENTER. Okay, looks like I need them.
098:07:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oops! Hey, the chart says you need some aft.
098:07:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, so does this.
098:07:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, but it says my - my chart says aft 6.
098:07:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, goodness.
098:07:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): So ...
098:07:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We're not going to do that ...
098:07:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No.
098:07:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ... We're going to do what the PGNS says here. Minus 1.6.
098:07:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, are you going to [garble] okay.
098:08:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Waiting for the flashing 6085. Should be there right now. There it is; we're going to burn.
098:08:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Wait a second.
098:08:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Shoot.
098:08:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oops. [Garble] be careful of the ...
098:08:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble].
098:08:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, be careful of the bounce.
098:08:23 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:08:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Looks good.
098:08:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's good.
098:08:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. PRO. Let me just make sure ...
098:08:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, midcourse is complete.
098:08:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... we want to go P00 again, right?
098:08:29 Scott (Gumdrop): Did you finish?
098:08:30 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Midcourse is complete?
098:08:31 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger.
Long comm break.
098:08:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, let's follow this checklist now just exactly the way it's supposed to go.
098:08:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, hell, we don't want to go to P00 ...
098:08:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We go to VERB 93 and then ...
098:08:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): VERB 93, ENTER.
098:08:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): And then ENTER, 37, 35.
098:08:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 35, ENTER. Okay.
098:08:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, let me just stay here and make sure that first mark got in, and then I want to put VERB 76 in. It's taking something; let's see what it's going to spit out.
098:09:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Got it, okay?
098:09:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Fine. VERB 76.
Range is 12 miles; range rate, 96 feet per second.
098:09:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We got a digital jump on our range tape.
098:09:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Did we?
098:09:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, we are. We're getting big jumps, about 1000 feet.
098:09:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Ah ha. That's going to make it interesting.
098:09:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): See it?
098:09:47 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, we're about on, if you ought to get something on the - on the big cards.
098:09:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right about - how about 56K?
098:09:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:09:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): How much is it jumping? Oh, that much?
098:10:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, figuring jumps to about the start ...
098:10:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): There we go, 56, 49. Oh, my God.
098:10:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What are you on it?
098:10:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right on it.
098:10:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, I'll get it; I'll take it. Have you got some cameras we can take a picture of Gumdrop with?
098:10:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes. Can I turn up the lights? Is he bright enough?
098:10:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I'm - listen, I'm not even looking at him.
098:10:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, good.
Range 8 and a half miles, range rate 77 feet per second and closing.
098:10:39 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Did we get the 93 in there? Yes, we did.
098:10:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, we did. Yes.
098:10:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Ohhhh.
098:10:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We're standing by on the 17.
098:10:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Come on now, don't be stubborn. Right in there; there you go.
098:11:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Be careful you don't punch that through the window. That would ruin the whole day.
098:11:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:11:45 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, Houston, We're about one minute LOS Carnarvon. We'll see you over the Huntsville in about 8 minutes.
098:11:50 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, Houston. What have you decided about that post - or after I get up there? Should I go ahead and dock or not?
098:11:56 Roosa: Okay, Jim. We're looking through here and there are a couple of things we really would like to have and that's some pictures taken of the ascent engine area, and we would like to get the rendezvous radar corona test. [Pause]
098:12:12 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Depends on when I break out of sunlight, what I can do for you.
098:12:15 Roosa: Okay; very good.
098:12:19 McDivitt (Spider): And I'm going to go into darkness; wondering how we're going to get the probe fixed.
098:12:22 Roosa: Okay; we understand. And have you talked this over with Dave? We haven't heard his comments on the probe. [Pause]
098:12:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble].
098:12:33 Schweickart (Spider): Dave, can you hear him? [Pause]
098:12:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, he copied. Okay.
098:12:39 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger, Houston. You copy Gumdrop?
098:12:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Okay, 56; that was 44 and 564.
098:12:41 Roosa: We've got Gumdrop here, but I'm going to lose you in just a few seconds. We'd like to have your comments on the probe, too, over Huntsville up here.
098:12:50 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay, and be ready to give me a GO for the PYRO ARM there too, please.
098:12:54 Roosa: Okay; very good.
Long comm break.
And this is Apollo Control at 98 hours, 13 minutes. Carnarvon has LOS. We'll miss the Honeysuckle on this revolution, this 62nd revolution. The next station to acquire will be Huntsville at 98 hours, 19 and a half minutes. You heard during this pass the RCS propellant quantities remaining; system A, 74 percent, system B, 66 percent. The crew in Spider has done the first midcourse, very small corrections. And you heard a discussion pertaining to the request from Jim McDivitt to dock very shortly after rendezvous, because of possibility of a problem in the drogue - probe, rather. We do want to get some photography on Spider particularly the ascent engine section and the area in which staging took place. And Jim indicated that he would try to do as much as he could depending on how much time he had available. He does not want to wait too long toward darkness before he tries to dock, however. It's now been 17 minutes and 5 seconds since TPI and we're looking for a rendezvous very close to 30 minutes after TPI. We do not have a precise time yet. It'll be right at 30 minutes. This is Mission Control Houston.
098:13:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we're right on it.
098:13:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:13:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, and I'm standing by for a 17-minute mark.
098:13:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right, we've got a minute 50 to go to that.
098:13:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Right, okay, and I got the camera out, and it checked out. Okay, let me verify the settings on it, though.
098:13:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Where's that corona test.
098:13:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I did that.
098:13:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Who does the - who does the jet firing on this corona test?
098:13:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We do.
098:14:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, it's running.
098:14:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Okay, 1 minute to the mark.
098:14:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Get back over here.
098:14:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 10 seconds.
098:14:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
098:15:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
098:15:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 17 minutes. Okay, that was - what - and 61 and what the heck was that? 35?
098:15:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's 35, yes.
098:15:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 35.
098:15:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, now we're standing by for ...
098:15:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] 30, 63.3.
098:15:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 19 minutes, we do a PRO.
098:15:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, we - we may need just a tad up. We've dropped a hair below the line.
098:15:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:15:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): But just a hair. And I'll take one at - 18:30. We'll take another mark, and see ...
098:15:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] radar there.
098:15:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... what that looks like. Say again.
098:15:56 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, that's kind of ricocheting around up there.
098:15:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): What's that?
098:16:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): The line-of-sight rate, that's all.
098:16:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, yes. Well, they're steadier right now, as a matter of fact, than they should be, according to what Grumman was saying. They had some - a couple of characteristic oscillations ...
098:16:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:16:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... on them that aren't showing up. Okay, 18:30. Can you give me a mark here?
098:16:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I can.
098:16:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, great. What was that, 30 ...
098:16:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 30 000 ...
098:16:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... 30 000 and 68.7. Okay, we're still right below the line.
098:16:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Maybe zero. Okay, you got a PRO coming up?
098:17:03 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, Dave, we're trying for our second midcourse.
098:17:07 Scott (onboard): Okay.
098:17:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, you see his thrusters firing again?
098:17:13 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Okay, when do we get your next one? At 20, isn't it?
098:17:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes at 20. 30 seconds, okay. I got that.
098:17:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:17:37 McDivitt (onboard): Want my DELTA-V for my next midcourse, Dave? Gumdrop?
098:17:44 Scott (onboard): Yes, go ahead.
098:17:45 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, plus 0.2, minus 0.9, minus 1.8.
098:17:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Here, we got 10 seconds to get this thing.
098:17:53 Scott (onboard): Got it.
098:17:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:17:54 Scott (Spider onboard): Got them.
098:17:59 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
098:18:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): MARK.
098:18:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, that's 4 - 49. What was that, 20 - 25 4 and 49 ...
098:18:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 49 feet per second. Okay, did you get that stuff?
098:18:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Just I minute - 73.37. Okay, and that's FORWARD 1.8, LEFT 0.9 and nothing. Okay, go.
098:18:36 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. What ...
098:18:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... talk about nominal.
098:18:39 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We're - bypass the AUTO maneuver. Okay, I'm going to leave this program.
098:18:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:18:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I'm going to go to 41; I'm going to ENTER that; and I'm going to go past that; and I'm going to PROCEED past that. While I'm on that, do a VERB -
This is Apollo Control at 98 hours, 19 minutes and Gumdrop and Spider are coming up on the Huntsville now.
098:19:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): There's a nothing UP/DOWN again.
098:19:09 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Okay, so ENTER. We're just sort of putting in what we took out last time.
098:19:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble].
098:19:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] not going to call ...
098:19:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I got a FORWARD 1.
098:19:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:19:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Which is close to what the PNGS says.
098:19:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): This shows a foot out of plane, a foot per second out of plane.
098:19:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
HUNTSVILLE (REV 62)
098:19:49 Schweickart (Spider): Okay; about 15 seconds ago, Dave.
098:19:52 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. [Long pause]
098:20:03 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, thrusting.
098:20:04 Scott (Gumdrop): Hey, Rusty. [Long pause]
098:20:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, there are big bounces here, by the way.
098:20:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. Okay, that's good. Okay.
098:20:20 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, they're essentially zero.
098:20:21 Schweickart (Spider): Okay [garble] we will.
098:20:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] P00.
098:20:24 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Pause]
098:20:30 Scott (Gumdrop): What kind of range rate do you have?
098:20:32 Schweickart (Spider): I have 18 700. Right now, it's 42 feet per second.
098:20:39 Scott (Gumdrop): All right. I've got 3.0 miles at 43 feet per second.
098:20:44 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
098:20:46 Scott (Gumdrop): What's your pitch angle?
098:20:48 Schweickart (Spider): It's about 86 degrees - something like that.
098:20:53 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Long pause]
The Spider was doing the second and last midcourse as we acquired there.
098:21:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, let me look ahead here and see if I can figure out what's going on. Here, let me call the VERB 62 for you. Okay?
098:21:16 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:21:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 40 feet per second, right on the money. Did you get the 90 yet?
098:21:24 Schweickart (Spider): You can let - [Pause]
098:21:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No, not the 90 yet. We're just a tad off nominal. The - the last time [garble] ...
098:21:26 Schweickart (onboard): Did you get the 90 yet?
098:21:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You're on 90 if you pitch UP there.
098:21:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] the ORB RATE ball isn't right.
098:21:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:21:35 Schweickart (Spider): Dave, do you want to get some pictures of the ascent engine area?
098:21:40 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. I got that. Thanks.
098:21:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, he's in sunlight.
098:21:42 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
098:21:45 Scott (Gumdrop): Oh, I see you out there coming in the sunlight.
098:21:48 Schweickart (Spider): Great.
098:21:51 Scott (Gumdrop): You're the biggest, friendliest, funniest looking spider I've ever seen. [Pause]
098:21:54 Scott (onboard): Do you want...
098:21:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Do you want the DAP where it is?
098:21:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I do.
098:21:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. Let me look ahead to this corona test here.
098:22:01 Roosa: And, Spider/Gumdrop, Houston. We are copying you through the Huntsville - next five minutes.
098:22:06 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
098:22:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): And let me know when you want P47, Jim.
098:22:09 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, in regards to your last request, we have no TM here at the Huntsville in regards to that PYRO ARM. [Pause]
098:22:20 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Understand. [Long pause]
098:22:42 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, Gumdrop. [Pause]
098:22:49 Roosa: Go, Gumdrop. Houston.
098:22:53 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. We've got a bird here. The only thing I could think of on that probe is that my fingers slipped off of the switch before it got all the way out. Other than that I just can't think of a thing.
098:23:04 Roosa: Roger. That's about the only thing we can come up here with - that you didn't hold the switch long enough, Dave. I guess - How do you feel about it? You think it's anything - any problem? [Pause]
098:23:23 Scott (Gumdrop): No, I really don't. I went back to see if they [garble]...
098:23:25 Scott (Spider onboard): ...had gone ...
098:23:26 Scott (Gumdrop): ... a way out to retract, and I had the barber poles which said they had extended all the way. Then I went up to extend again and it dropped right off.
098:23:35 Roosa: Roger, Gumdrop. Copy. [Long pause]
098:23:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Jim.
098:23:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:23:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): It looks to me as - if we just move right on through this, we're going to do the whole damned thing anyway.
098:23:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:23:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): As long as we stay in-plane on the ball, we just do the VERB 49 maneuver, do pitch up 90 degrees, let him take the pictures. We can set up the rendezvous radar while he's taking the picture, and pitch right back down again. And that does the corona test.
098:23:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, fine.
098:23:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:24:01 McDivitt (onboard): ...tell me when you want...
098:24:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ...the P47.
098:24:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You can bring it up now. Hey, let me get VERB 77 in there first.
098:24:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:24:10 McDivitt (Spider): Dave, I think what we'll do is come on up and stop out front there and pitch over so you can look at our ascent engine, then pitch back around.
098:24:14 McDivitt (onboard): And then we'll start the docking.
098:24:19 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Pause]
098:24:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, if you want to follow me through this one I'll - I'll just call out the DSKY calls for you.
098:24:26 Scott (Gumdrop): I agree. We ought to get on with it.
098:24:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:24:28 McDivitt (Spider): Yes. [Pause]
098:24:38 Scott (Gumdrop): What kind of range do you have now?
098:24:40 McDivitt (Spider): I have 9800 feet and a range rate of 32-1/2 feet per second.
098:24:45 Scott (Gumdrop): Thank you.
098:24:47 McDivitt (Spider): I have just a little bit of line-of-sight rate up.
098:24:51 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger.
098:24:53 Scott (Gumdrop): I have just about 9000 feet and 33.
098:24:55 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. [Long pause]
098:25:01 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'll let you know as soon as it comes up, Jim.
098:25:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, because I'm going to start tossing them out here pretty soon.
098:25:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. It's probably just about 10 more seconds. Okay, there it is.
098:25:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Okay, I'm on my line-of-sight rate, Dave.
098:25:22 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, I'll turn on my line-of-sight rate now, Dave.
098:25:25 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay.
Comm break.
098:25:38 Schweickart (Spider onboard): A little more up. Oh, you can see it there.
098:25:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:25:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'm going to call the VERB 62 here. Okay.
098:26:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Shoot, we're going to go through the first braking gate without braking, too.
098:26:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, beautiful. Okay, I'm going to get my Hasselblad ready. 11 at a 25Oth.
098:26:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:26:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Once again you're going to get the good pictures on your side.
098:26:27 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That's right; that's right.
098:26:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay. I'll tell you what, you want to do that while he stationkeeps, and I'll just set up the DAP and go ...
098:26:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay. Oh, gees, what was that! - What in [garble] was that ...
098:26:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... on that corona test.
098:26:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ... We just threw a great big hunk of junk out of our thrusters, there.
098:26:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Really, this isn't the time to be messing with that kind of thing. Boy, look at that stuff coming out from around him when he fires his thrusters; it's amazing!
098:26:51 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. I just went to 6000 feet at 30 feet per second.
098:26:54 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Pause]
098:26:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I think I'm going to turn the camera on. How much more time we got - 32.5 minutes at 4 -
098:27:03 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What have we got, the wide angle - You won't see a thing here, Rusty.
098:27:05 Roosa: Okay. We copy you. Right on the breaking schedule, Spider. And we'll wee you over Hawaii in about 3 minutes. [Long pause]
098:27:06 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Wow, you're right. This one did too. I'm going to take a picture of the thruster out there.
098:27:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, he's coming now. Okay, Dave, I can see the shape of the spacecraft now for the first time.
This is Apollo Control at 98 hours, 27 minutes. Huntsville has LOS. And Spider right on the flight plan numbers at that first breaking gate - which called for 30 feet per second at 6,000 feet, and that's exactly what he called out as showing on his rendezvous radar. As you heard discussion on the probe during this pass, Dave Scott has come to the conclusion that maybe he didn't hold the switch in long enough during the undocking. He has tried it since that time and it appears to work properly. We'll come back up at Hawaii at 98 hours, 30 and one-half minutes. This is Mission Control Houston at 98 hours, 29 minutes.
098:27:38 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, Dave. I can see...
Comm break.
098:27:40 McDivitt (onboard): ...the shape of the spacecraft now for the first time.
098:27:42 Scott (onboard): Good.
098:27:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, 6 frames a second. Okay, here it goes.
098:28:07 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, tape, if you're running, I'm at - still at 30 feet per second, at 3500 feet. Hey, we look closer than that, don't we? Okay, Dave, I'm at 3000 feet; I'm braking down 20 feet per second.
098:28:25 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, Dave, I'm at 3000 feet; I'm braking down at 20 feet per second.
098:28:30 Scott (onboard): Okay.
098:28:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Boy, look at all that stuff, would you.
098:28:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): 24, 23, 21, 20.
098:28:50 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, we're 20 feet per second now at 2400 feet.
098:28:54 Scott (onboard): Alright.
098:29:04 Scott (onboard): I got a little line-of-sight rate.
098:29:07 McDivitt (onboard): Yes, me too.
098:29:26 McDivitt (onboard): Okay, I'm coming up on 1500 feet; I'm braking down to 10 per second.
098:29:29 Scott (onboard): Okay.
098:29:45 McDivitt (onboard): Okay. There we are - We're at 10 feet per second at 1500 feet.
098:29:53 McDivitt (Spider): Boy, are you bright, Dave. I'm not sure I'm going to be able to see to dock with this COAS I have. [Long pause]
This is Apollo Control 98 hours 30 minutes. We'll stand by now for Hawaii acquisition. Maybe we'll pick up some air-to-air prior to acquisition as we have on another site or two. We're 32 and a half minutes away from the TPI burn now.
098:30:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Just a little up. Beauty! This is running just like the simulator.
098:30:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, isn't it. I just hope the docking goes like it.
098:30:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Let's hope it doesn't. (Laughter) As I recall, the simulator didn't work well.
098:30:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): See, that clock isn't doing anything any more is it?
098:30:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, it's just counting up from ...
098:30:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, why don't we use 30 minutes - I want to know how much daylight I have left here.
098:30:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
HAWAII (REV 62)
098:30:38 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. I'm at 950 feet, 10 feet per second.
098:30:41 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Sounds pretty good. [Pause]
098:30:49 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, we've got you through Hawaii now good and solid, and I copied your last transmission; sounds great.
098:30:55 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. [Long pause]
098:30:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Thank you.
098:31:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Takes a little longer to take that DELTA ...
098:31:07 Scott (Gumdrop): Your thrusters are little yellow dots.
098:31:09 McDivitt (Spider): Yes. They're really throwing a lot of stuff off. [Pause]
098:31:18 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. We're 5 feet per second, about 610 feet.
098:31:24 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Pause]
098:31:29 Scott (Gumdrop): But you are upside down, again.
098:31:31 McDivitt (Spider): Yes. I was just thinking one of us isn't right-side up. [Pause]
098:31:39 Scott (Gumdrop): Boy, you've got contraptions hanging out all over.
098:31:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Hold this just a second.
098:31:44 McDivitt (Spider): That's show biz. [Long pause]
098:31:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Alrighty.
098:31:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Wind - are you going to wind it?
098:31:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:32:16 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. I have us about 370 feet.
098:32:19 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Looks closer than that.
098:32:21 McDivitt (Spider): Doesn't it, though? [Pause]
098:32:33 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Got your camera out so you can take a picture of my bottom half?
098:32:36 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Why don't you come all the way in and stop and then pitch over?
098:32:40 McDivitt (Spider): Yes, that's what we're doing. We come on in and stop, and then you're going to take over stationkeeping and I'll pitch around. [Long pause]
35 minutes since TPI.
098:32:47 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:33:09 Scott (Gumdrop): Give me a Mark next time you turn your thrusters on.
098:33:12 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, 3, 2, 1.
098:33:14 McDivitt (Spider): MARK.
098:33:17 Scott (Gumdrop): Thank you. [Pause]
098:33:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, you're going up a bit, yes?
098:33:23 Roosa: How does that sports car handle, Jim?
098:33:26 McDivitt (Spider): Pretty nice. [Long pause]
098:33:50 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, Davey. It says 100 feet on the radar tape. It looks a little closer to that to me, but what do you say we stop here?
098:33:58 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. That's a good idea. [Pause]
098:34:04 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. I'll get a STOP and STABILIZE and then give it to you. [Long pause]
098:34:28 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. That looks pretty good to me.
098:34:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, here you go.
098:34:33 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, good.
098:34:34 McDivitt (Spider): Let me take a couple of pictures of your nose; then I'll start, pitching around.
098:34:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I'll set up this stuff here.
098:34:37 Scott (Gumdrop): All right. [Pause]
098:34:42 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. You tell me while I guide it, okay?
098:34:46 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, babes. You've got it now.
098:34:48 Scott (Gumdrop): Alrighty; I've got it. [Long pause]
098:34:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay ...
098:34:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Go - go ahead - I - I got a lot of work to do here.
098:34:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:35:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Come on P00. Get in there, damn it.
098:35:14 McDivitt (Spider): I don't even see you in there, David.
098:35:16 Scott (Gumdrop): Oh, I'm here. [Pause]
098:35:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Which side is he on - he's on - he's on your side.
098:35:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:35:23 Scott (Gumdrop): I've been waiting for you to bring that good water back. [Long pause]
098:36:20 Schweickart (Spider): Okay, Dave. We're going to start up on AUTO MANEUVER here, and we're going to pitch up; then you can take a picture of our bottom.
098:35:25 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, here we go.
098:36:26 Scott (Gumdrop): Alrighty.
098:36:27 Schweickart (Spider): Here we go. 2 degrees per second.
098:36:29 Schweickart (Spider): Okay, half-degree per second.
098:36:32 Scott (Gumdrop): That's a little better. [Long pause]
098:35:37 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, shoot [garble] OPS.
098:35:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] OPS. Okay, we're going to start the pitch here at 355 and 90 ...
098:35:48 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Are we going to do an AUTO maneuver?
098:35:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... is - yes. VERB 49, it's going to be ...
098:35:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Wait a second ...
098:35:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] 00 and 85. Okay, VERB 49, ENTER; VERB 25 ENTER; plus 0 - plus 00 - oops, CLEAR. Plus 085 00, ENTER; plus 0000 [garble] ENTER 12 - Okay, you ready.
098:36:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, let me - let me talk to him. Okay, Dave, we're going to start on AUTO maneuver here, and we're going to pitch up. And then you can take a picture of our bottom.
098:36:24 Scott (Spider onboard): Alrighty.
098:36:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, here we go, 2 degrees per second.
098:36:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, it's a half.
098:36:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, half a degree per second.
098:36:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): [Garble] Okay. Okay, now let's start getting the rendezvous radar ready.
098:36:49 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, what do I have to do with this?
098:36:51 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh hell, we can't do that until the damn - That's another extended verb. Okay, let's - let's put it in SLEW and break lock by going up.
098:37:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:37:13 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Shoot, it's going to stay locked on no matter what you do, I think.
098:37:15 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:37:17 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:37:20 Scott (Spider onboard): Upside down a little bit at [garble].
098:37:21 Scott (Gumdrop): It's quietened down a little bit if it looks funny.
098:37:23 Schweickart (Spider): I'm - We're looking at you.
Comm break.
098:37:25 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, I'm - I wasn't looking at you.
098:37:27 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, if we get up here, I'm going to - We're going to finish up the AUTO maneuver and change the DAP to 2012 and set up the rendezvous radar, but I don't know how the hell we're going to get it to designate down there, because if it won't break lock - It's going to be difficult to - to get the job done.
098:38:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, let's see, what do we have to do here?
098:38:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, like I said, as soon as we get up there ...
098:38:36 Scott (Gumdrop): Looks like a big black hole where an engine used to fire.
098:38:39 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Get a picture of it, I guess.
098:38:39 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We're at TPF 18 where we're going to ...
098:38:43 Scott (Gumdrop): I've got a couple. Why don't you just keep going the way you're going?
098:38:48 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
098:38:51 Scott (Gumdrop): You've got another 20 degrees to go. [Long pause]
098:39:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): What we have to do - All we have to do is put the shaft and trunnion someplace?
098:39:08 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, at 0 and 300. Why don't you try to break on that thing after we get up here while I reload the DAP here. We ought to be able to slew the thing up and get it out of there. God, he's putting out so much signal, we don't know what to do.
098:39:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:39:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, there we are. We're in hold. Okay, VERB 48, ENTER; VERB 21, ENTER; 2012 ...
098:39:42 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. I can see injectors. As a matter of fact, I can even see the chamber right now.
098:39:48 Schweickart (Spider): Okay, fine. Let's take another picture there, and we're going to maneuver back around.
098:39:50 Schweickart (Spider onboard): This one is going to be faster.
098:39:53 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. This will be 2 degrees per second.
098:39:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay [garble] 41, NOUN 72, ENTER. Let's try it.
098:39:55 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Go ahead; I've got the pictures. [Pause]
098:39:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's punch it in there, designate, then if it doesn't go, the heck with it.
098:40:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Plus 30000. Okay.
098:40:06 Scott (Gumdrop): How fast you going to do this one?
098:40:07 Schweickart (Spider): 2 degrees a second.
098:40:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ENTER; looks lilke it - PRO. VERB 16, NOUN 72, ENTER. It's not going, okay?
098:40:11 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Long pause]
098:40:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, the heck with it.
098:40:19 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hell with it?
098:40:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, the hell with it.
098:40:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Standby, let me see what I want to do with this. VERB 44, ENTER. Okay, now I want to go VERB 49 and pitch right back down there again.
098:40:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:40:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): VERB 49, ENTER; okay, VERB 22, ENTER; plus all zips. No, I want to do that one to go plus 35500.
098:40:46 Scott (Gumdrop): Say a Mark before you start, will you?
098:40:48 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. [Long pause]
098:40:49 Schweickart (Spide onboard): PRO; okay, want to tell him 3, 2, 1, MARK?
098:40:52 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 355, you know.
098:40:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay - get this - Why don't you put the - the signal strength on there anyway.
098:40:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): The transmitter power?
098:40:58 Schweickart (Spider onboard): The transmitter power, yes.
098:40:59 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, we're going to start.
098:41:01 Schweickart (Spider): I'll maneuver now, Dave. You ready?
098:41:04 Scott (Gumdrop): Go. [Long pause]
098:41:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 3, 2, 1 -
098:41:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): MARK.
098:41:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, the deadband is going to go out first and that is going to [garble]. Okay, the signal strength is 2.7.
098:41:16 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, for your information we could never get the radar to unlock, so we couldn't [garble].
098:41:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We want to see if it changes there ...
098:41:25 Roosa: Roger. Understand. The rendezvous radar stayed locked. [Long pause]
098:41:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Roger.
098:41:32 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Shoot, it's not changing at all.
098:41:35 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No. It's not firing either.
098:41:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, well, wait until it thrusts - when the thrusters fire is when we are liable to have it happen. Like right now.
098:41:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No - no change at all? Still 2.7.
098:41:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, let's get out of here.
098:42:00 Schweickart (Spider onboard): PGNS RENDEZVOUS RADAR, OPEN.
098:42:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): PGNS RENDEZVOUS RADAR, OPEN. RENDEZVOUS RADAR, OPEN.
098:42:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you got both of those. Okay, VERB 44, ENTER. Okay, that's done. PRO. Okay, now what DAP [garble] for the docking?
098:42:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I want 00002.
098:42:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, VERB 48, ENTER; VERB 21, ...
098:42:20 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You did get VERB 21.
098:42:21 Schweickart (Spider onboard): VERB 21, ENTER; ...
098:42:21 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. I guess the next order of business is to get set up.
098:42:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... 2, ENTER ...
098:42:25 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Get set up and let's get on with the docking.
098:42:26 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... PRO; PRO. Go. Okay, that's narrow deadband.
098:42:29 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Do you want to stationkeep on me?
098:42:31 Schweickart (Spider): I've got it.
098:42:32 Scott (Gumdrop): You've got it. [Pause]
098:42:35 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, why don't you stationkeep for a minute -
098:42:36 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble] okay? Don't worry about fuel.
098:42:41 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston. We're standing by for your logic and PYRO ARM.
098:42:46 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger, Houston. Thank you. Logic on my Mark: 3, 2, whoops! Stand by. Okay, 3, 2, 1.
098:42:55 Scott (Gumdrop): MARK.
098:42:57 Roosa: Roger. Copy.
098:42:58 Roosa: PYRO ARM. [Pause]
098:43:08 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, Houston. You are GO for PYRO ARM.
098:43:11 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Understand. GO for PYRO ARM. Pyros arming now. [Long pause]
098:43:22 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh shoot. Would you believe it's not even on now?
098:43:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You got the overhead?
098:43:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. [Garble] looked like it gave you [garble] the Earth. Oh, there it is.
098:43:30 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, there it is. Holy Christmas.
GOLDSTONE (REV 62)
098:43:34 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Houston, this is Gumdrop here. I've got the full-extend/retract switch in RETRACT. I've got two barber poles. Should have a couple of grey, I believe. [Pause]
098:43:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh shoot.
098:43:50 Roosa: Roger, Gumdrop. We copy. [Long pause]
098:44:03 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I wonder what that means?
098:44:04 McDivitt (Spider onboard): That means we may not get back on it. Okay, I got it again.
098:44:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, you got it?
098:44:13 Schweickart (Spider): When did they go on barber pole, Dave?
098:44:17 Scott (Gumdrop): Well, when I checked them for full extension before, they were barber pole. [Long pause]
098:44:16 Scott (Spider onboard): And then when I went back and pushed it to EXTEND, again, to get you off, they went gray, dropped off.
098:44:34 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Then they say they're barber pole now, huh?
098:44:38 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Maybe that's right, huh? [Pause]
098:44:44 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Now, I went - now, I cycled again out to EXTEND and now back to RCTRACT, and I've got two grey.
098:44:50 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
098:44:51 Scott (Gumdrop): So I think we're all right now.
098:44:53 Schweickart (Spider): Yes. Let's get on with it and see if we really are.
098:44:55 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay Do you want to try AUTOMATIC RETRACT?
098:44:57 Schweickart (Spider): Let's try ATOMATIC RETRACT just like we talked about it.
098:45:01 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay.
098:45:04 McDivitt (Spider): Why don't you do your roll? When you do that, then I'm - How's the Sun? Would you be able to dock on top of me if I can't see you?
098:45:13 Scott (Gumdrop): I'm in good shape sunwise.
098:45:15 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Fine.
098:45:16 Scott (Gumdrop): Maybe we ought to not try AUTOMATIC RETRACT, because what if I - There's something sort of worrying me. If I hit the RETRACT now, it might go.
098:45:25 McDivitt (Spider): Okay; fine. That's a good idea - excellent idea. Let's leave it where it is, and when I punch in you pull me in.
098:45:31 Roosa: Spider, Houston.
098:45:33 McDivitt (Spider): Go ahead.
098:45:34 Roosa: Roger. Would you verify your DAP load prior to this docking?
098:45:39 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. The DAP's four balls 2.
098:45:42 Roosa: Okay. Thank you very much. [Pause]
098:45:48 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay, and I'm going to go VERB 76, ENTER - ENTER when you tell me to go to FREE.
098:45:54 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Right.
098:45:55 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, Gumdrop.
098:45:57 Roosa: Go, Gumdrop.
098:45:59 Scott (Gumdrop): I think we're okay on the probe now. Do you concur?
098:46:04 Roosa: Roger. It sounds like it's okay now, Dave. Yes, we concur.
098:46:09 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Pause]
098:46:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:46:15 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay, Spider, I'll do stationkeeping when you turn around.
098:46:19 McDivitt (Spider): Why don't you do your roll first. Dave?
098:46:21 Scott (Gumdrop): Alrighty. Here we go.
098:46:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ...So that I can get that - that...
098:46:22 McDivitt (Spider): [Garble] window over on the other side
098:46:25 Scott (Gumdrop): Rolling left 60.
098:46:26 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. [Long pause]
098:46:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Shoot, let me get that camera back. Where the hell's the camera?
098:46:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's in here. Why don't you turn the movie camera on?
098:46:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): That's all used.
098:46:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's all used?
098:46:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:46:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): There's a good - pictures now.
098:46:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Boy, they sure are.
098:46:48 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Sun's out the window now, too.
098:46:55 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Can't get that God damn thing off of there - Sure is - Oh boy, we're going to come over the Earth.
098:47:14 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, we waited too long.
098:47:19 McDivitt (Spider onboard): You ever going to be able to see that COAS?
098:47:24 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. I'm holding now, 60-degree left roll. Could you stand by 1 second while I turn the docking light on for you?
098:47:30 McDivitt (Spider): Sure. [Long pause]
098:47:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I don't even know where the docking light is to look for it.
098:47:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I think he means the docking target.
098:47:49 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, yes, maybe he does. There it is; it's on.
098:48:01 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:48:02 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. I've got it, Dave - very faintly.
098:48:06 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Stand by. [Long pause]
098:48:26 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Now all set. Tighten that band and the whole works.
098:48:29 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, Dave. Now you stationkeep and I'm going to pitch over.
098:48:33 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Long pause]
098:48:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, yon want to go to -
098:48:39 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] attitude hold for one thing.
098:48:42 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Down 10 degrees, so you've got to go to 265. I can tell you when have gone exactly 90.
098:48:46 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Okay, fine.
098:49:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Damn it, come on. Shoot.
098:49:19 Scott (Gumdrop): Hey, you've still got the target.
098:49:21 McDivitt (Spider): Good. [Pause]
098:49:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, the hell with it. I'll slip it down here. Okay, you've got 15 degrees to go. Okay, you got 5 degrees to go. You've rolled a bit; you right there. Yes, 1 more degree. Okay, that's good on the yaw ...
098:49:30 Scott (Gumdrop): And the drogue. [Long pause]
098:49:46 Scott (Gumdrop): Right there looks pretty good. [Pause]
098:49:52 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. You've got it?
098:49:53 Scott (Spider onboard): Looking better, huh?
098:49:53 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... and a roll right.
098:49:54 McDivitt (Spider): Not yet.
098:49:55 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. [Pause]
098:49:56 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, a couple more degrees there and about another 2 degrees at pitch.
098:50:04 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. I can't see my COAS against you right now; let me get up closer.
098:50:09 Scott (Gumdrop): All right. Okay. You've got the stationkeeping, right?
098:50:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Here let me get this window shade up for you.
098:50:11 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
098:50:12 McDivitt (Spider): I've got it.
098:50:13 Scott (Gumdrop): All right. [Long pause]
098:50:15 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, I got the window shade up for you. Shoot, I don't even know where that - Oh, there it is.
098:50:32 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, I mangled my helmet, so I can't even use it. Oh!
098:50:36 McDivitt (Spider): I've got to look through the top of my helmet. Am I beaded up?
098:50:40 Scott (Gumdrop): You've got to come back quite a ways, to your rear. [Pause]
098:50:40 Scott (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:50:51 Scott (Gumdrop): Easy does it.
098:50:55 Scott (Gumdrop): Whoops! Too far.
098:50:57 Schweickart (Spider): Yes, I know. [Pause]
098:51:04 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, let me -
098:51:04 Scott (Gumdrop): It looks like a sporty little machine.
098:51:05 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble].
098:51:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Man.
098:51:07 Schweickart (Spider): It's not even going in the right direction. [Long pause]
098:51:09 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, I think it's the ATTITUDE HOLD. Jim, ...
098:51:11 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:51:12 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... that's kind of faking you. We know we're about 5 or 10 feet out.
098:51:18 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:51:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): We're probably going to get a heater light here.
098:51:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:51:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, don't let that bother you.
098:51:33 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, Gumdrop. What time is sunset? [Pause]
098:51:40 Roosa: It's 99:15, Gumdrop.
098:51:43 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, we got ...
098:51:44 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. We got about 25 minutes.
098:51:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): ... 24 minutes.
098:51:47 Scott (Spider onboard): [Garble] how many.
098:51:47 Roosa: That's affirmative. [Pause]
098:51:53 McDivitt (Spider): I just can't even see the COAS, Dave. I don't know exactly where you are with respect to it.
098:51:58 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. You want me to do it?
098:52:00 McDivitt (Spider): No. Let me work my way in here a little closer.
098:52:02 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay.
Comm break.
098:52:07 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, that attitude's just right.
098:52:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I can't even see it.
098:52:36 Schweickart (Spider onboard): You may have to actually get her right on the target before you can see it, being right next to it.
098:52:41 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:52:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I can't see it. There it is, way over there now.
098:53:20 Schweickart (Spider onboard): How's it controlling?
098:53:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's okay. I haven't done any attitude control yet.
098:53:24 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, uh huh. It looks real good.
098:53:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Sorry to say I haven't had to do any. That's why it's controlling okay.
098:53:28 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes.
098:53:29 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Wait until I do something.
098:53:30 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Don't do any (laughter).
098:53:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh, man, I just can't see the target or the COAS. Oh, there it is over there now.
098:53:53 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Just can't see it.
098:54:05 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Just can't see it, let me get in a little closer.
098:54:06 Schweickart (Spider): Dave, I just can't see it. Let me get in a little closer.
098:54:09 Scott (Gumdrop): You're coming fine. Just keep coming easy like that. Looks like you are coming from an angle, but you are coming in with the right attitude. You ought to go forward and to your right a little bit, relative to your body.
Comm break.
098:55:14 Scott (Gumdrop): You're fine. [Pause]
098:55:15 Scott (Spider onboard): That's it.
098:55:23 Scott (Gumdrop): Right there.
098:55:25 Schweickart (Spider): That doesn't look like it to me.
098:55:27 Scott (Spider onboard): No.
098:55:28 Scott (Gumdrop): You get to come in from an angle anyway, so you're doing good.
098:55:31 Schweickart (Spider onboard): How close are you?
098:55:34 McDivitt (Spider onboard): I don't know.
098:55:35 Scott (Gumdrop): Your yaw is off about 2 degrees. [Pause]
098:55:41 McDivitt (Spider): I just can't see the darn COAS. I can't see what my attitude is. [Pause]
098:55:51 Scott (Gumdrop): Yes. [Long pause]
098:56:15 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. I'm lined up in translation, but I can't tell what my attitude is, Dave.
098:56:20 McDivitt (Spider): If I don't see it - There it is, there.
098:56:24 Scott (Gumdrop): Now you're coming in.
098:56:27 Scott (Gumdrop): That's looking better.
098:56:30 Scott (Gumdrop): There you go.
098:56:32 Scott (Gumdrop): I think you've got a handle on it now.
098:56:33 McDivitt (Spider onboard): No.
098:56:34 McDivitt (Spider): It keeps disappearing.
098:56:39 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Now you're looking pretty good. [Long pause]
098:56:59 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. You're moving into the boundary. You're inside the capture boundary now. [Pause]
098:57:13 Scott (Gumdrop): You're okay. [Pause]
098:57:18 Scott (Gumdrop): Looking good. [Pause]
098:57:22 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. I can see it now. [Pause]
098:57:33 McDivitt (Spider): Thing's really sporting.
098:57:34 Scott (Spider onboard): It...
098:57:35 Scott (Gumdrop): Sure is; I can tell. You are looking good. [Pause]
098:57:46 Scott (Gumdrop): Keep it coming. [Pause]
098:57:54 Scott (Spider onboard): You're...
098:57:55 Scott (Gumdrop): Almost there. [Long pause]
098:58:08 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. You are about there.
ASCENSION (REV 63)
098:58:XX Unidentifiable Crewmember: [Garble] about here.
098:58:XX Scott (Gumdrop): Yes.
098:58:42 Scott (Gumdrop): I have capture.
098:58:43 McDivitt (Spider): Very good!
098:58:44 Schweickart (Spider): Great!
098:58:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Free.
098:58:46 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay, Let's get her lined up.
098:58:47 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Why don't you do it? I can't tell where it is. We're in FREE now.
098:58:51 Scott (Spider onboard): Good job.
098:58:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Boy, we need a new COAS. This isn't a docking maneu ...
098:58:58 Roosa: Good show, Spider,
098:59:00 McDivitt (Spider onboard): It's an eye test.
098:59:03 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Our onboard fuel reading: 65 and 65 - Make it 55 and 55.
098:59:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): 55.
098:59:10 Roosa: Roger. 55 and 55. Thank you, Rusty.
098:59:15 Scott (Gumdrop): Retract.
098:59:16 Scott (Gumdrop): Did you get the latches?
098:59:20 Scott (Gumdrop): Hang on.
098:59:21 Unidentifiable Crewmember: [Garble]
098:59:21 McDivitt (Spider onboard): We got those latches, baby!
098:59:22 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Oh, did that sound good!
098:59:25 McDivitt (Spider): Whew! I haven't heard a sound like that in a long time!
098:59:30 Scott (Gumdrop): And it's a very nice docking.
098:59:31 McDivitt (Spider onboard): God dag...
098:59:32 McDivitt (Spider): [Garble] That wasn't a docking; that was an eye test!
098:59:33 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
098:59:36 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, Houston. We're locked up.
098:59:40 Roosa: Sounds like you passed the 20-10, Jim. That sounded real beautiful. Good show.
098:59:45 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Let's see something here. Just for fun (laughter). Whew! Range, range rate, not bad.
099:00:07 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay, Spider. I'm in FREE and you're in FREE, and you may proceed into the tunnel here when I get squared away.
099:00:10 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Roger.
099:00:15 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, Dave. We'll start getting ready for the unmanned APS.
099:00:22 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Why don't you take a break for a while?
099:00:24 Schweickart (Spider): No, we've still got a lot to do.
099:00:26 McDivitt (Spider): Man, when I take a break, I'm going to bed for three days.
099:00:29 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger.
099:00:31 McDivitt (Spider): Houston, did you get that?
099:00:32 Roosa: Roger, Spider. Houston copies. [Pause]
099:00:37 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Here, you want to stick these in that center pocket?
099:00:40 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes, let's take all ...
099:00:41 Roosa: We concur. Three days off.
099:00:43 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Here.
099:00:44 McDivitt (Spider): What is that? Saturday and Sunday and Christmas? [Pause]
That was Jim McDivitt.
099:00:45 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Let's take and put all the - all the data...
099:00:55 Roosa: That was a hard day's work; and it looked real good, troops.
099:01:00 McDivitt (Spider): Thank you, Smokey. I may [garble].
099:01:02 McDivitt (Spider onboard): ...and, hey - Ah, shoot.
099:01:05 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Almost sure ...
099:01:05 McDivitt (Spider): ...Smokey, you still there?
099:01:07 Roosa: Yes, Jim. We're still got you for about another minute here.
099:01:11 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Listen, I hope the whole world's listening, but I tell you I think we got greatest set of flight controllers that we've - is anyplace that can be found. I'd like to thank you all, and I'm sure that the rest of the guys up here would too.
099:01:25 Roosa: Roger, Spider. We copy. Thank you very much.
Comm break.
099:01:40 Schweickart (Spider onboard): What do I hear?
099:01:42 McDivitt (Spider onboard): The S-band break-up.
099:01:44 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, I don't think so. Yes, it is, but it's a funny sound. Let's put that data in the center [garble].
099:01:55 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble]. (Cough) Hold - hold it there just a minute.
099:01:57 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay.
099:01:58 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Gee. I don't. I was leaning my adam's apple up against my neckring.
This is Apollo Control at 99 hours, 2 minutes and there are a number of cigars being broken out in the control room right now - after that docking. Jim McDivitt's problem - there, the COAS he kept referring to is Crew Optical Alinement Sight - it's in his window and it has a lighted reticle in it but the background light was so bright that it washed out the reticle in his sight and he had very difficult time seeing through the sight and alining because of that reason. We have some unofficial times here, for rendezvous and docking. The rendezvous times that we will give you are plus times from TPI. The TPI time was 97 hours, 57 minutes, 59 seconds. 36 minutes, 42 seconds from that time, Jim McDivitt said, "It looks pretty good to me", indicating that the relative motion between the two vehicles was hulled. At 37 minutes even from TPI, Dave Scott in Gumdrop took over the station keeping task. As they were breaking and coming in, Dave Scott remarked that the LM thrusters were throwing a lots of stuff out - and he also said, "You have contraptions hanging out all over you." We don't know precisely to what he was referring - whether there was something hanging down from the staging or whether he was referring to all of the antennas that are on the ascent stage of the Lunar Module. Capcom Stu Roosa asked Jim McDivitt "How does that sportscar handle Jim?" and the response was, "Pretty nice." The ascent stage alone is a pretty zippy little vehicle and handles somewhat like a sportscar apparently. We marked the report of auto capture during the docking at 98 hours, 58 minutes, 41 seconds. We marked the report that they were locked up at 98 hours, 59 minutes, 38 seconds. And you heard Rusty Schweickart report the onboard RCS propellant remaining, 55 percent in both systems. So we have completed this crucial rendezvous and docking - very tiring day for the crew and I think you heard their conversation there - they are ready for a rest - however, they still have a fair amount of work to do before they can take a rest today. They'll be cleaning up the Lunar Module and reconfiguring it for the unmanned ascent propulsion system burn to depletion. Which will take place about 102 hours, about 3 hours from now. So Gumdrop and Spider are back together. McDivitt and Schweickart still in the LM, preparing it for the long burn of the ascent propulsion system. We will be coming up at Ascension - here we are now.
099:02:10 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Well, you got it over your hose, Jim. You're not going to get out of it. Hey, is that what you call a nominal rendezvous? Holy smoke! Except for the undocking.
099:02:28 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes.
099:02:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Here you go. Oop, oop, oop. Go ahead.
099:02:36 Communications Technician: Go ahead. [Pause]
099:02:42 Scott (Spider onboard): Spider, I'm going to put it in a wide deadband hold here, so we don't lose the platform.
099:02:43 Communications Technician: [Garble]. [Long pause]
099:02:44 Scott (onboard): [Garble] I'm going to put it in lockup and hold it there [garble] don't be too [garble].
099:02:49 McDivitt (onboard): That a boy!
099:02:51 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Say, I wonder if we ought to do a wide deadband attitude hold? No.
099:02:54 Schweickart (Spider onboard): What are we going to do with all that fuel?
099:02:57 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Use it for S - service module RCS deorbit, babe. You're not on the ground yet.
099:03:02 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, but we got - we got enough for two of those.
099:03:06 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Well, we've still got 5 more days. I wonder if it'll control?
099:03:11 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Hey, no. There's no docked DAP in this.
099:03:12 McDivitt (Spider onboard): [Garble] CSM.
099:03:14 Schweickart (Spider onboard): No, but that's only with descent stage.
099:03:17 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Oh.
099:03:18 Schweickart (Spider onboard): I forgot about that, as a matter of fact. I'll tell you what. Let's take these clips back for souvenirs.
099:03:26 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Yes. We ought to take the whole light.
099:03:29 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Yes, take the COAS. Take the radiation survey viewer. Let's take back some souvenirs. If it's not screwed down, (laughter) take it back.
099:03:37 Roosa: ARIA 6, this is Houston CAP COMM.
099:03:38 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Wait until we start to use our parachutes, too.
099:03:41 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Our what? Oh, yes.
099:03:42 Communications Technician: Houston CAP COMM, ARIA 6.
099:03:44 Roosa: Roger. Do you hear anything from the spacecraft?
099:03:44 McDivitt (Spider onboard): Turn the tape off.
099:03:46 Schweickart (Spider onboard): Okay, tape coming off.
099:03:49 Communications Technician: That's negative at this time. We don't have an S-band signal.
099:03:53 Roosa: Okay. If you get a lockup, would you call me on air-to-ground here? I'd like to talk to them.
099:03:59 Communications Technician: That's roger.
Comm break.
ARIA 6 (REV 63)
099:05:38 Roosa: Roger. [Long pause]
099:06:07 Communications Technician: Houston, this is ARIA 6. Is two-way lock modulation ON?
099:06:12 Roosa: Roger, ARIA 6. Go REMOTE.
099:06:15 Communications Technician: Roger. We're REMOTE. [Pause]
099:06:19 Roosa: Hello, Spider/Gumdrop. This is Houston through ARIA 6. How do you read? [Long pause]
099:06:41 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston through ARIA 6. Do you read? [Long pause]
099:07:14 Roosa: Okay, ARIA. You can go LOCAL. I guess we aren't going to get them. We'll try them through Ascension. Thank you.
ASCENSION (REV 63)
099:07:19 McDivitt (Spider): Go ahead, Houston. You just come in.
099:07:22 Roosa: Roger. Spider, we are curious about the option on the AOT star alignment. Are you going to do that? [Long pause]
099:07:48 McDivitt (Spider): Houston, I don't know - how long do you have we have until that docked - that on-band APS burn, now?
099:07:57 Roosa: Stand by.
099:07:59 McDivitt (Spider): I've got my flight plan tucked under my belt right now. [Long pause]
099:08:26 Scott (Gumdrop): And, Houston, anytime you've got it, we'll take the update on the P30 for the APS burn. [Long pause]
099:09:07 Communications Technician: Roger. Over and out.
099:09:09 Roosa: Spider, Houston.
099:09:12 McDivitt (Spider): Go ahead.
099:09:14 Roosa: Roger. The first opportunity we have, that we feel we can make, is about 102 hours; it's 101:52. [Pause]
099:09:26 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. I'm just wondering about our difficulty in trying to clean up big messes when we're moving things back and forth; and if we take too much time out, I was concerned about getting the thing ready. We'll see how things go here. Okay?
099:09:45 Roosa: Okay. There is - The first opportunity is a little over an hour from now, and I didn't even want to pass that on to you. It's your decision, but I don't think you can make that one.
099:09:57 McDivitt (Spider): Yes. I kind of doubt it, too.
099:10:01 Roosa: Okay. We concurred to not even shoot for that one, and we're looking now at 101:52. [Pause]
099:10:11 Roosa: Gumdrop, do you read Houston?
099:10:15 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, do you call Gumdrop?
099:10:18 Roosa: Roger. If we are going to do the AOT star alignment - I guess it'll depend on how things go, but I have some gimbal angles you'll need for that. I can give them to you anytime you want, if you want then at all.
099:10:32 Scott (Gumdrop): Well, why don't you give them to me? Let me get a piece of paper, here, and we'll have them if we can use them.
099:10:37 Roosa: Okay. [Long pause]
099:10:50 Scott (Gumdrop): Gumdrop is ready to copy.
099:10:52 Roosa: Roger. For star 15: roll 35 36 32 81 365; and star 25: 34 74 26 61 35 97. [Pause]
099:11:23 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Copy. For star 15: 35 36 32 81 365; for star 25: 34 74 26 61 35 97.
099:11:37 Roosa: Roger. That is confirmed, Gumdrop. And one fast question: did you ever see the tracking light on Spider?
099:11:44 Scott (Gumdrop): No; it was out when he got here.
099:11:46 Roosa: Understand. [Pause]
099:11:54 Scott (Gumdrop): But the way this navigation works in here, you hardly need a nightside pass.
099:12:00 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston copies. Sounds great.
099:12:04 Scott (Gumdrop): [Garble] go next flight.
Comm break.
099:14:43 Roosa: Spider, Houston. [Long pause]
099:14:55 Roosa: Spider, Houston.
099:15:00 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, Gumdrop. Go.
099:15:01 Roosa: Gumdrop, would you relay to Spider that we would sure like to have him check that OPS heater again before he stows that OPS that had failed? I'm going to lose you here, and we'll try to talk to you over Tananarive at around 25.
099:15:16 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Understand. Spider, they want you to check the OPS heater, the one that failed, before you put it away. [Pause]
099:15:25 McDivitt (Spider): Okay.
099:15:27 Scott (Gumdrop): They got it, Houston.
099:15:29 Roosa: Roger, Gumdrop. Copy. And I copied Spider there.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 99 hours 18 minutes. Ascension has LOS. We have a very short pass at Tananarive this time, we'll come back up at 99 hours 24 and a half minutes, and see how the communications are through Tananarive. This is Mission Control Houston at 99 hours 19 minutes.
099:22:59 McDivitt (onboard): Gumdrop, you got the tunnel pressurized?
099:23:01 Scott (onboard): I'm doing it right now.
099:23:03 McDivitt (onboard): Dave, if you want, we can pressurize it for you.
099:23:09 Scott (onboard): Well, I'll get it halfway. Why don't you do it halfway?
099:23:13 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
099:23:23 McDivitt (onboard): All the way.
099:23:29 Scott (onboard): I've still got a DELTA-P. Huh!
099:23:36 McDivitt (onboard): Maybe our pressure just isn't high enough.
099:23:38 Schweickart (onboard): No, ours is higher than his; ours is 5.2. DELTA-P may be the other way, Dave.
099:23:47 Scott (onboard): No, because I started out from one end of the [garble], and worked halfway back to [garble].
099:23:54 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, well, it's - The tunnel's 5.2.
099:24:01 Scott (onboard): Okay, it came down; it must have just been hung there.
099:24:05 Schweickart (onboard): Okay.
099:24:07 Scott (onboard): Thank you.
099:24:08 Schweickart (onboard): REG's A and B are in EGRESS.
099:24:09 McDivitt (onboard): Yes.
099:24:10 Schweickart (onboard): OVERHEAD VALVE is OPEN; stow OPS for - stow - stow helmet bags on the deck, yes.
099:24:20 Schweickart (onboard): They go in - Get them as close as you can, and as far forward as you can, Jim.
099:24:26 Schweickart (onboard): That's good.
099:24:37 Schweickart (onboard): Really is.
This is Apollo Control at 99 hours, 24 minutes, and we are acquiring at Tananarive. We'll stand by.
TANANARIVE (REV 63)
099:25:28 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston through Tananarive. Standing by. [Long pause]
099:25:47 McDivitt (onboard): Hey...
099:25:48 McDivitt (Spider): Gumdrop, are we in any kind of... [Pause]
099:25:50 McDivitt (onboard): ...an attitude for docked alignment?
099:25:52 Scott (onboard): Oh, I don't know. I guess - I'll check. What kind of attitude do you want?
099:26:01 Schweickart (Spider): I fired that one, Dave. Hey, right now we are in the right kind of attitude.
099:26:08 Schweickart (Spider): Hey, listen. Maybe if you went to FREE, and we took control here, we could just jockey around and do it. [Pause]
099:26:15 Scott (onboard): Okay, I'm for that. I'll go to FREE, and you got, it.
099:26:19 Schweickart (onboard): Yes.
099:26:20 Schweickart (Spider): We have it. [Long pause]
099:26:27 Scott (onboard): But I'm 12 - 30 something - I guess 55 degrees from gimbal lock; we're okay.
099:26:40 Scott (onboard): But I'm not going to be able to monitor your attitude. Okay?
099:26:43 McDivitt (onboard): Okay.
099:26:44 Unidentifiable Crewmember: [Garble].
099:26:47 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, Houston through Tananarive. [Long pause]
099:27:46 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston transmitting in the blind. I'm not picking you up. We would like to recommend you use the LM RCS just as much as possible. We used just a little more command module CSM RCS there than we'd predicted on the rendezvous. [Pause]
099:28:10 McDivitt (Spider): Okay, Houston. This is the Spider here. We're using our RCS thrusters.
099:28:14 Roosa: Okay. Real good.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 99 hours, 30 minutes. We've had LOS at Tananarive. The next station to acquire will be Carnarvon in approximately 8 and one-half minutes. During this pass over Tananarive we asked that Spider start - take over the attitude - the control job to conserve RCS propellant in the Command Service Modules. This is Mission Control Houston.
099:30:24 Scott (onboard): Spider, Gumdrop.
099:30:25 Schweickart (onboard): Go ahead.
099:30:27 Scott (onboard): How about that mate? 12 latches again!
099:30:30 Schweickart (onboard): Hey, that's really great, isn't it?
099:30:33 Scott (onboard): Yes, all of them just locked in solid as they can be.
099:30:37 Schweickart (onboard): When you threw me off into oblivion out there, I was wondering if - I was wondering if I was ever going to hear those latches go "click" again.
099:30:44 Scott (onboard): Oh, yes, they were going to work.
099:30:53 Schweickart (onboard): That's already there, Jim.
099:30:56 Scott (onboard): Do you have a good pressure vessel over there?
099:30:59 McDivitt (onboard): Roger; we do.
099:31:01 Scott (onboard): Okay.
099:31:19 Schweickart (onboard): Wait a minute now; hold on there...
099:31:23 Schweickart (onboard): Okay, you can go either way.
099:31:28 Schweickart (onboard): Far wide.
099:31:34 Schweickart (onboard): No, I can't use pulse, Jim. I got to -
099:31:38 Schweickart (onboard): Jim, I can't help that!
099:31:39 McDivitt (onboard): Well, you couldn't mate...
099:31:41 Scott (onboard): Got mate.
This is Apollo Control at 99 hours 40 minutes, and Carnarvon has acquisition of Gumdrop and Spider.
CARNARVON (REV 63)
099:40:20 Roosa: And, Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
099:40:28 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger, Gumdrop. [Long pause]
099:41:08 Roosa: And, Spider, do you read Houston. Are you too - Gumdrop, if they're too busy to answer, let me know. [Pause]
099:41:18 Scott (Gumdrop): Go ahead. Houston, Gumdrop.
099:41:20 Roosa: Roger. Do you know if Spider's reading me or is just too busy - can't answer me?
099:41:27 McDivitt (Spider): We were reading you; we were kind of busy, Stu.
099:41:30 Roosa: Okay, Gumdrop. At a convenient time, would like for you to pass to them this - We want to do a couple of steps on that AGS system troubleshoot - that warning light - prior to them doing the AGS give align and update. [Pause]
099:41:51 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. We'll do that.
099:41:53 Roosa: Okay. [Long pause]
099:42:17 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston. We're noticing your surge tank down a little.
099:42:22 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. That could be from the tunnel PRESS.
099:42:26 Roosa: Roger [Pause]
099:42:36 Scott (Gumdrop): Boy, it is down a little, isn't it?
099:42:40 Roosa: That's roger.
099:42:42 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Spider, Gumdrop.
099:42:46 McDivitt (Spider): Go ahead.
099:42:47 Scott (Gumdrop): Hey, listen, we're dropping off quite a bit on our surge tank, and I think it might be either the tunnel or you. The latches look good; I think we've got a good seal. How are you doing over there? [Pause]
099:43:09 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. We got our cabin pressure way up to - We're 5.9. In fact, we're going to relieve it in a minute here.
099:43:14 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay. Listen, maybe you ought to open that door. The surge tank is down to 400, and we ought to do something here pretty quick.
099:43:22 McDivitt (Spider): Roger.
099:43:25 Roosa: Gumdrop, Houston. Could you check your cabin air return valve? [Pause]
099:43:33 Unidentifiable Crewmember: How about that.
099:43:36 McDivitt (Spider): Is the tunnel okay, Dave? I'll open up the door.
099:43:40 Scott (Gumdrop): Yes. I've got the probe out.
099:43:45 McDivitt (Spider): Okay. Open the hatch. [Pause]
099:43:54 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, that's the suit return valve we'd like to have you take a look at.
099:43:59 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. You're right. That one was still closed.
099:44:05 Scott (Gumdrop): I had just taken helmet and gloves off after going into the tunnel, and I hadn't opened that. [Pause]
099:44:16 Scott (Gumdrop): Okay, Houston. I see it. Surge tank's going back up.
099:44:18 Roosa: Okay. Thank you, Gumdrop.
099:44:22 Scott (Gumdrop): Thank you, Smokey.
099:44:24 Roosa: Roger. [Long pause]
099:45:16 Roosa: Houston, here's your dock alignment. Do you have the star angle difference? [Pause]
099:45:25 Roosa: Stand by. Spider, just one.
099:45:28 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. It's 5 zeros - give you the torque... [Pause]
099:45:35 McDivitt (Spider): Hi, Dave!
099:45:36 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, are you ready to copy torqueing angles?
099:45:38 Roosa: Okay. I have them now.
099:45:41 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Understand you've got the torqueing angles.
099:45:45 Roosa: Affirmative, Spider. I have the torqueing angles.
099:45:48 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
099:45:50 Roosa: And that's pretty good on that star angle difference. Way to work, big team!
099:45:58 Schweickart (Spider): Yes. Crazy? It's a little longer.
099:46:02 Roosa: Yes. It's real swinging, and we're about to lose you at Carnarvon in 30 seconds, and we'll see you over Hawaii at 04.
099:46:10 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Will you have a PAD by that time?
099:46:13 Roosa: That's affirmative. I have the PAD in my hand now.
099:46:18 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. We'll see you at Hawaii with it.
099:46:20 Roosa: Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 99 hours 46 minutes, Carnarvon has LOS. This revolution goes right between the acquisition zones of Huntsville and Guam, so we won't be back in touch with Gumdrop and Spider until we get to Hawaii at 100 hours 04. This is Mission Control Houston at 99 hours 47 minutes.
099:46:26 Schweickart (onboard): Okay.
099:46:45 Schweickart (onboard): Huh?
099:46:48 Schweickart (onboard): Well, no.
099:47:17 Schweickart (onboard): Yes.
099:47:27 Schweickart (onboard): Yes.
099:47:31 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, they're somewhere that's real handy.
099:48:10 Schweickart (onboard): Well, shoot!
099:48:13 Schweickart (onboard): Wait a minute.
099:48:22 Schweickart (onboard): There's so much junk over here.
099:48:27 Schweickart (onboard): Huh?
099:48:32 Schweickart (onboard): Oh, I don't know - soon as - (laughter). Yes.
099:48:44 Schweickart (onboard): Huh?
099:48:47 Schweickart (onboard): Sure. It's the COAS.
099:49:05 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, we got plenty of room over there for stuff.
099:49:12 Schweickart (onboard): Are you still attitude-holding over there?
099:49:21 Schweickart (onboard): Okay.
099:49:44 Schweickart (onboard): Hey, listen, don't stow this quite yet.
099:50:37 Schweickart (onboard): Yes.
099:51:09 Schweickart (onboard): I'm going to take me a pee.
099:51:23 Schweickart (onboard): It what?
099:52:01 Schweickart (onboard): [Garble] oh, come on. Dirty bastard outfaked me.
099:52:11 Schweickart (onboard): Gee, I thought I had one all figured out.
099:52:36 Schweickart (onboard): Hey, this thing is hot! Yes, whew!
099:52:43 Schweickart (onboard): Quite a surprise.
099:53:01 Schweickart (onboard): Those guys really make things strong.
099:53:27 Schweickart (onboard): Huh? This thing right here? Take that bolt out? - That bolt out, it comes right off. Take that off. [Garble].
099:53:49 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, I got that big bagful of garbage.
099:54:34 Schweickart (onboard): Here you go. Huh? Wait, just wait a minute, until I [garble].
099:55:50 Schweickart (onboard): Is the toolkit out, or did you put it back?
099:55:55 Schweickart (onboard): Oh, shoot! I was going to go find the toolkit, but it's not where the toolkit goes!
099:56:08 Schweickart (onboard): What do you want - the [garble]?
099:56:16 Schweickart (onboard): I wonder what happened to that thing.
099:56:30 Schweickart (onboard): Hey, Jim. You don't remember where you put the toolkit, do you?
099:56:40 Schweickart (onboard): No, sir.
099:56:56 Schweickart (onboard): You're lethargic!
099:57:16 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, here it comes. Huh?
099:58:32 Scott (onboard): Is that far enough?
099:58:35 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, that's as far as it goes.
099:58:39 Schweickart (onboard): Well - well, I guess you can get it one more - Yes, you can collapse it a little bit more.
099:58:56 Schweickart (onboard): Here, I'll get it.
099:59:05 Schweickart (onboard): I'm not sure we can do it out here. Pull it out to the green [garble]. Right there. Now stroke.
099:59:20 Schweickart (onboard): That's it. That's all the way.
100:00:37 Schweickart (onboard): What else you need?
100:01:17 Schweickart (onboard): Shouldn't we ought - You probably not ought to screw it up too much, because if the pyros don't go - That's the only way we're going to get off. Yes.
100:01:35 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, people will laugh. Not you.
100:01:45 Schweickart (onboard): Take those things off that and [garble].
100:01:51 Schweickart (onboard): Take that off and give them a [garble] boop-boop! [Garble].
100:02:06 Schweickart (onboard): Oh, I'm sorry, Jim. Guess I was holding my [garble] too [garble].
100:03:06 Schweickart (onboard): All this stuff is being recorded for the ground review.
100:03:10 Scott (onboard): Yes.
100:03:17 Scott (onboard): Okay.
100:03:47 Schweickart (onboard): You know what else we need to do? Bring all the logs.
100:03:57 Schweickart (onboard): What are you bringing that for?
100:04:01 Scott (onboard): Got anything for [garble]?
100:04:11 Schweickart (onboard): (Laughter} [garble] had [garble].
This is Apollo Control at 100 hours, 5 minutes and Hawaii has acquired Gumdrop and Spider.
HAWAII (REV 63)
100:04:40 Roosa: Spider/Gumdrop, this is Houston through Hawaii.
100:04:44 Scott (Gumdrop): Hello, Hawaii, Gumdrop. We're making progress.
100:04:49 Roosa: Roger. Understand. And whenever you all are ready, I have your APS depletion PAD and your LM jettison attitude. [Pause]
100:04:59 Scott (onboard): Okay...
100:05:00 McDivitt (Spider): ...Rusty?
100:05:01 Scott (Gumdrop): Stand by.
100:05:02 Roosa: Roger. [Long pause]
100:05:21 Roosa: And, Spider, Houston. We'd like to uplink your state vector. I noticed you are in P00 now. We can go if you will give us permission.
100:05:31 Scott (Gumdrop): Is that for Spider or Gumdrop?
100:05:34 Roosa: That was for Spider.
100:05:36 McDivitt (Spider): Roger, Houston. Say again. This Spider.
100:05:39 Roosa: Roger, Spider. You are in P00. We'd like to uplink you a state vector.
100:05:43 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Go ahead. And I am ready to copy your PAD.
100:05:48 Roosa: Okay. And are you ready - Okay, here is the APS depletion: 101 52 4400, plus 52356, minus 52682, plus 00520 74275 314 023. Guess you really didn't need those, did you? Okay. Plus 48549, minus 52675, plus 19626. That's the end of the APS depletion PAD. And your LM weight: 9549. [Pause]
100:07:13 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. On the readback I got 101 52 4400, plus 52356, minus 52682, plus 00520 74275 314 023, plus 48549, minus 52675, plus 19626; and LM weight: 9549.
100:07:46 Roosa: Roger. And for the jettison attitude, I have angles for either the CSM or the LM, if you wanted to maneuver with the LM - save a little command module CSM RCS fuel. [Pause]
100:08:03 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Go ahead with them. I don't know which one we'll do.
100:08:06 Roosa: Okay. Reading the angles for the LM: roll 314, pitch 023, yaw 011; and the CSM angle: 318.5, 282.0, 044.7. And we are through with the computer. [Pause]
100:08:35 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. I understand that you are through with the computer. Be advised our docking ring angle now has changed, and therefore, I think, probably the CSM angles will have to be modified to a certain extent. Docking ring angle is now minus 0.2.
100:08:53 Roosa: Roger. Understand docking ring is minus 0.2. How come you were so sloppy in roll there? [Pause]
100:09:03 McDivitt (Spider): I don't think I'll say anything to that.
100:09:05 Roosa: (Laughter) [Long pause]
100:09:23 Roosa: Okay. And, Rusty, we've got a little troubleshooting, here, on the AGS - we'd like to do on that warning light. We don't know if you want to take the time or not. [Long pause]
100:09:49 Roosa: Spider, this is Houston. Do I still have you?
100:09:53 Schweickart (Spider): All right. Go ahead, Houston.
100:09:56 Roosa: Roger. We've got a procedure here that we'd like to do concerning the AGS, and it's that caution light - We'd like to have you do this procedure prior to the AGS update in your checklist. [Pause]
100:10:10 Schweickart (Spider): Roger.
100:10:12 Roosa: Are you ready to copy?
100:10:15 Schweickart (Spider): Stand by. How long is it?
100:10:17 Roosa: It's about five steps.
100:10:19 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Stand by.
100:10:23 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Go ahead. [Pause]
100:10:29 Schweickart (Spider): All right, Houston. Go ahead.
100:10:31 Roosa: Roger. Step 1 is: perform normal turn-off procedure. Verify the AGS caution light goes out. Open, then close the caution CWEA circuit breaker. Perform the normal turn-on procedure. And then, after you have done this, why, reset the AGS time and update and align as normal checklist. [Pause]
100:11:12 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. You want a normal AGS turnoff. You want to verify the AGS caution light out. Open and close CWEA breaker, perform a normal turn-on and update and align the AGS.
100:11:23 Roosa: That is affirmative, Spider. [Long pause]
100:11:51 Schweickart (Spider): Hey, Jim. Are you going to do that checklist?
100:11:56 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Seems to me there's one more thing I have got to get down here; I can't think of what it is [garble]. [Long pause]
REDSTONE (REV 64)
100:12:24 Roosa: Spider, Houston. We should have you through the Redstone now. [Pause]
100:12:32 Communications Technician: Redstone here.
100:12:34 Roosa: Roger. Rusty, we also would like to request that you bring the LM COAS back into the CSM. [Pause]
100:12:44 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Do you have data at the Redstone here, Houston?
100:12:49 Roosa: That's affirmative.
100:12:51 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Do you want me to go through that procedure right now?
100:12:54 Roosa: On the AGS? Yes, let's do.
100:12:59 Schweickart (Spider): Coming up.
100:13:04 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, Gumdrop.
100:13:06 Roosa: Go ahead, Gumdrop.
100:13:08 Scott (Gumdrop): Roger. Do you have any suggestions on anything else we might leave in the LM to lighten up the command module?
100:13:17 Roosa: We copy that. Stand by. We'll put that in work. We'd like to have you turn off the fan in H2 tank 2.
100:13:25 Unidentifiable Crewmember: All right. [Pause]
100:13:34 Schweickart (Spider): The light is still on. [Garble] caution light came on when I went to STANDBY on the powerup again, and it stayed on after pushing in the AEA breaker and going to OPERATE. [Pause]
100:13:52 Roosa: Roger. We copy. [Pause]
100:14:01 Roosa: Okay. We have no more questions. Rusty, if we could get you to cycle the track light on and off, we've got data now. Could you do that for us? [Pause]
100:14:13 Schweickart (Spider): Spider. Track light on; track light off. [Pause]
100:14:25 Roosa: Okay. Rusty, could you do that for us once more? On your Mark.
100:14:30 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. 3, 2, 1.
100:14:32 Schweickart (Spider): MAPK.
100:14:33 Schweickart (Spider): Track light on. Let me know when you want it off.
100:14:36 Roosa: Okay. Turn it off on your Mark.
100:14:39 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. 3, 2, 1.
100:14:41 Schweickart (Spider): MARK.
100:14:42 Schweickart (Spider): Track light off.
100:14:46 Roosa: Okay. Thank you very much. And one other change to your checklist: in the closeout here, we want you to change - Put the S-band antenna on the number 2 AFT position. This is rendezvous page 41, step 10. [Pause]
100:15:08 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. S-band antenna to AFT. [Pause]
100:15:16 Roosa: And, Spider, one other thing. We would like to - This is on rendezvous-42, step 5. Do not ascent feed system A. Leave system A in NORMAL and system B to ASCENT FEED INTERCONNECT. [Pause]
100:15:41 Schweickart (Spider): Understand. Do not ASCENT INTERCONNECT SYSTEM [garble] Gumdrop, did you get that? [Pause]
100:15:55 McDivitt (Spider): Yes. He didn't want one of the ascents interconnected, but I don't know whether it was A or B.
100:16:00 Roosa: Spider, it is do not connect - interconnect system Alpha. Interconnect system Baker only. [Pause]
100:16:08 McDivitt (Spider): Roger. Bravo only; and negative on the Alpha interconnect.
100:16:12 Roosa: Very good. Thank you. [Long pause]
100:16:24 Unidentifiable Crewmember: [Garble].
100:16:26 Roosa: Okay. Rusty, one other thing: we want you to leave the track circuit breaker open. [Pause]
100:16:39 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Is that the track light circuit breaker?
100:16:42 Roosa: That is affirmative. Your track light circuit breaker. It's rendezvous-43; step 3. We would like that open.
100:16:49 Schweickart (Spider): It's open now.
100:16:50 Roosa: Very good. Thank you [Pause]
100:16:57 Schweickart (Spider): Okay, Jim. [Pause]
100:17:04 Schweickart (Spider): Commander.
100:17:07 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Roger. Do you read?
100:17:08 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Now I do.
100:17:09 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Commander's suit isolation with suit disconnect; connect the LM hoses and stow; CDR transfer to the CSM with the ISA and the CDR rendezvous checklist - I've done that - We've got the index, and we've got the PLSS cartridge over here.
100:17:25 McDivitt (Gumdrop): And do you have PLSS stowed now?
100:17:27 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Go ahead. I have everything stowed on the floor. Go ahead and read it.

100:20:56 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. I got it.
100:20:57 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Did you get the tape off of there?
100:20:59 Schweickart (Spider): I'll get it.
100:21:00 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Okay. Why don't you get it and throw it in here now so that we won't forget it?
100:21:03 Schweickart (Spider): S-band AFT.
100:21:04 McDivitt (Gumdrop): FORWARD or AFT.
100:21:09 Roosa: That was a change. We want that on number 2 AFT.
100:21:14 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Okay. S-hand 2 AFT.
100:21:17 Schweickart (Spider): Jim, you'll have to say that one again. I missed it after we talked about the tape recorder. You bypassed me there.
100:21:23 McDivitt (Gumdrop): S-band number 2 AFT.
100:21:26 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Got it.
100:21:28 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Next step: suit gas diverters go to EGRESS.

100:21:40 Schweickart (Spider): PLSS fill, CLOSE.
100:21:42 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Descent O2, CLOSE.
100:21:45 Schweickart (Spider): Is that descent, Jim?
100:21:46 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Descent. Descent O2, CLOSE.
100:21:48 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Got you.
100:21:50 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Ascent number 1 O2 CLOSE.
100:21:55 Schweickart (Spider): I think that was ascent number 1 O2 CLOSED. I don't know why you're cutting out, but the first words are cutting out, Jim.
100:22:00 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Just a second. Let me check some of the switches.
100:22:06 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Yes. These are the same kind I've always used. Let me check another lead here.
100:22:12 Roosa: Rusty, how do you read Houston?
100:22:14 Schweickart (Spider): You're five-square, Houston.
100:22:16 Roosa: Do you want me to read the list?
100:22:19 Schweickart (Spider): No. That's okay.
100:22:20 Roosa: Okay.
100:22:21 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Houston, how do you read me?
100:22:22 Roosa: I read you loud and clear, Jim.
100:22:24 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Okay. I guess we're incompatible up here.
100:22:27 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Okay. That's ascent number 1 O2 closed.
100:22:32 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Ascent number 1 O2 closed.
100:22:34 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Ascent number 2 O2 OPEN.
100:22:37 Schweickart (Spider): Ascent number 2 O2, OPEN.
100:22:39 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Suit isolation (Commander), SUIT DISCOSNECT.

100:22:50 Schweickart (Spider): Cabin gas return going EGRESS.
100:22:52 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Cabin relief and dump (2) to AUTO.
100:22:56 Schweickart (Spider): Cabin relief and dump: the forward is AUTO, and I'll put the upper in AUTO.
100:23:02 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Okay. DFI primary, ON; secondary, OFF.
100:23:06 Schweickart (Spider): DFI, DFI primary, ON; secondary, OFF.
100:23:11 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Okay, LMP transfer to the CSM umbilicals. We'll send them down to you in just a minute.
100:23:16 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
100:23:18 Roosa: Hey. Rusty. Houston. I want to remind you again that you're going to have to put new time in the AGS. That procedure we gave you wiped the time out of the AGS.
100:23:27 Schweickart (Spider): Roger, Houston. Thank you. [Long pause]
100:23:57 Roosa: And, Rusty. Want to remind you again of that new LM weight we parsed you.
100:24:05 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. Understand.
Comm break.
100:25:43 Schweickart (Spider): [Garble] there it goes. That was some state VEC you gave me. It integrated forever. [Pause]
100:25:52 Roosa: Roger. Understand.
Comm break.
100:27:33 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Hey, Rusty, are you still up there?
100:27:35 Schweickart (Spider): Yes.
100:27:37 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Okay. Are you switched over to the umbilical yet?
100:27:39 Schweickart (Spider): No. I'm loading the AGS here, Jim; just a minute.
100:27:41 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Okay. [Long pause]
100:28:31 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. Want me to transfer over now? [Pause]
100:28:38 McDivitt (Gumdrop): [Garble]. [Pause]
100:28:44 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Are you still on LM or on our COMM?
100:28:46 Schweickart (Spider): I'm on LM COMM.
100:28:47 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Okay.
100:28:49 Schweickart (Spider): Stand by. I'll switch it over.
100:28:51 McDivitt (Gumdrop): [Garble]. CSM umbilicals. And when you do that, we'll turn your suit flow on, and we'll turn your audio power off over here so we can switch over to it.
100:28:59 Schweickart (Spider): [Garble]. Okay. Dave? [Long pause]
100:29:14 Schweickart (Spider): [Garble]. Boy, sure getting a bunch of noise. [Pause]
100:29:30 Schweickart (Spider): Dave? [Long pause]
100:29:56 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. You can turn on suit flow, Jim.
100:29:59 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Okay.
100:30:02 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Okay. Your suit flow is on.
100:30:05 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. And I'm going to be disconnecting the COMM here; and give me about a minute and you can connect up there.
100:30:10 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Okay. Just a minute.
Comm break.
100:32:12 Roosa: And, Gumdrop, this is Houston. At any convenient time - stand by one, Gumdrop. Disregard that. [Pause]
100:32:22 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Okay. We will disregard your message.
100:32:24 Roosa: Roger. Understand. [Long pause]
100:32:53 Roosa: Okay. Gumdrop, Houston. If you've got one of the troops in there with a spare hand to write, I could give you your block data now. That would be one thing out of the way for tonight.
100:33:05 McDivitt (Gumdrop): Okay. Just a minute.

ANTIGUA (REV 64)
100:33:42 Schweickart (Spider): Houston, this is Spider, I guess.
100:33:48 Roosa: Roger, Spider I guess. This is Houston, I know.
100:33:53 Schweickart (Spider): Okay. If you can see the DSKY right now, you'll notice that the angles for NOUN 18 do not correspond with what you passed me on the data. [Pause]
100:34:05 Roosa: Okay, Rusty. That's something that I was wanting to get to you. The angles that I passed you were FDAI angles.
100:34:10 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. That's what I'm looking at, FDAI angles. However, yaw is not constrained, and it's a possibility that if we went to a right yaw angle that the pitch and roll would come in. [Pause]
100:34:27 Roosa: Roger. We agree with that, and we're having guidance reconfirm these angles now, Spider. [Long pause]
100:34:47 Scott (Gumdrop): Houston, go ahead with the block data if you like.
100:34:50 Roosa: Okay. I've got about minute here; I'll start reading: 065 4 Baker, plus 338, minus 1699, and Spider, we're saying if you do go to those angles - if you yaw, do that 011. That way we will have the right angles. [Pause]
100:35:17 Schweickart (Spider): Okay.
100:35:19 Roosa: I'm going to lose you here, Gumdrop. I'll finish up this block data over Ascension, and we'll hit Ascension at 42.
100:35:28 Scott (Gumdrop): Understand; 42.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 100 hours, 35 minutes into the mission. Antigua has lost the signal. During this pass you heard Jim McDivitt reading off a checklist to Rusty Schweickart, Jim back in the command module. Rusty still on the LM powering it down configuring it for this ascent propulsion system burn to depletion. We passed up a pad for that burn. Time of ignition, 101 hours, 52 minutes 44 seconds. DELTA V of 7,427.5 feet per second. This is about twice as much as we actually expect to get programming the computer for that much to insure that we will get a burn to fuel depletion. One of the last things that Rusty Schweickart will do before transferring back to the command module is to activate the ascent feed system to the LM RCS. This is the device that enables the RCS system to draw propellant from the ascent engine fuel tank. As you heard, we will only activate that system, the ascent feed, for RCS system A, not for System B. Ascensiom will acquire at 100 hours 42 minutes. We'll come back up then. This is mission control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 100 hours, 42 minutes, and Ascension Island has acquisition.

100:43:26 Scott (Gumdrop): Hello, Houston. This is Apollo 9. The Gumdrop [garble] right now, and we seem to not have the right angles on our DSKY [garble]. [Long pause]
100:43:58 Roosa: Apollo 9, this is Houston. You sort of dropped out on me. We're showing the right angles on the LM DSKY. Are you saying your angles are not correct in the command module? [Long pause]
100:44:48 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. [Long pause]
100:45:04 Roosa: Apollo 9, Houston. If you read us, we are showing both vehicles in the proper attitude - proper angles. [Long pause]

100:45:49 Roosa: Go, Spider.
100:45:51 Schweickart (Spider): Roger. I want to notify you that on the AGS all day long, 407 has been jumping to a plus 1. I'm going to set it back to zero here, but there isn't a snowball's chance it's going to stay there until the burn time. [Pause]
100:46:10 Roosa: Roger. Copy. Understand. [Pause]
100:46:17 Scott (Gumdrop): And, Houston, this is Gumdrop here. Do you want us to be in minimum deadband to hold this thing here now? [Pause]

This is Apollo Control at 100 hours, 49 minutes. Ascension - hang on.
We had LOS there but we thought we were trying to get something from Spider just after nominal LOS time, but apparently not. Tananarive will acquire very briefly on this revolution. We may or may not be able to establish communications. About a minute and a half pass there. At 101 hours, 1 minute, if we're not successful there, Carnarvon will be up at 101 hours, 14 minutes. And the White Team is in the process of handing over to Jerry Griffin and the Gold Team. However, Gene Kranz, the Flight Director, and most of this White Team will remain here through the ascent propulsion system burn. We're estimating the change of shift news conference for 4:30 PM Central Standard Time. This is Mission Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 101 hours 15 minutes ground elapsed time. We expect to have acquisition at Carnarvon in just a few seconds. Meantime we've had a shift change here at Mission Control. The Gold team has replaced the White. The voice of Capcom during this APS to depletion burn will be that of Ron Evans, astronaut Ron Evans. One other bit of general information to pass on to you and that is that the astronaut, the Apollo 9 crew wives, Mrs. McDivitt, Mrs. Schweickart and Mrs. Scott, are in the viewing room at the present time here to observe this maneuver.
CARNARVON (REV 64)
101:14:00 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
101:14:02 Evans: Houston. Roger. We're standing by for your logic switches.
101:14:07 Scott: Okay. Before that, do you have a separation attitude for us?
101:14:12 Evans: Affirmative. SEP attitude: roll, 137.4; pitch, 092.5; yaw, 021.9. And note your TIG is 101 plus 32 plus 44. [Long pause]
101:14:40 Scott: Okay. 137.4, 092.5. 021.9, at a TIG of 101 32 44. You're right there today.
101:14:52 Evans: Yes. Roger.
101:14:57 Scott: Okay. What's our jettison time to get off the LM? [Pause]
101:15:10 Scott: Houston, we're ready to [garble] update. [Pause]
101:15:16 Evans: Okay. We're standing by for your logic. [Pause]
101:15:25 Scott: All right. Logic bus ON at this time. [Pause]
101:15:38 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. You have a GO for PYRO ARM.
101:15:43 McDivitt: Roger.
101:15:44 Scott: Houston, one other question: what time do you want us to jettison the LM - What time do you want us to get off the LM? Do you have any preference?
101:15:52 Evans: Roger. Ten minutes prior to your SEP maneuver or at 22.
101:15:56 Scott: Okay. Understand 22.
Comm break.
101:17:07 Schweickart: Houston, Apollo 9.
101:17:08 Evans: Houston. Go.
101:17:10 Schweickart: Roger. Just to clarify one thing in the procedure, there, in exiting the LM. We left the ascent interconnects on system Alpha CLOSED and on Bravo OPEN. We also ran the same configuration on the main shut-off valve; that is, we closed the main shut-off valve in system Bravo and left it open in Alpha. Hopefully, that's what you wanted. [Pause]
101:17:39 Evans: 9, Houston. Affirmative; that's good.
101:17:43 Schweickart: Okay; thank you. [Long pause]
101:18:26 Evans: 9, Houston. Thirty seconds to LOS. Guam at 25, and it's looking good.
101:18:32 McDivitt: Okay; fine. Thank you. [Long pause]
101:18:56 Evans: 9, Houston. Just as a reminder, we didn't see your pyros on yet.
101:19:01 Scott: Okay. I'll get them on in just another minute or two.
Long comm break.
We have passed out of the range of the Carnarvon tracking station at the present time. Right now we're about 33 minutes away from the propellant depletion burn of the Lunar Module upperstage which of course has been identified in the air-to-ground communications as the APS burn to depletion meaning the ascent propulsion system burn to depletion. To review again that burn will take place at approximately 101 hours 52 minutes 44 seconds into the flight, and this maneuver will move the unmanned upperstage of the LM out of the vicinity of the command module. During the burn the ground will be shooting for a Delta-V of 7427.5 feet per second and the duration is planned for approximately 6 minutes. Now the burn really is deliberately programed for longer burning time than there is fuel available. It's a posigrade or forward burn that's planned and the apogee is going to end up to be rather high. LM stage probably will be in some type of an elliptical or egg shaped orbit with an apogee estimated at about 32 hundred nautical miles and a perigee at about a hundred and 30 nautical miles. Of course the burn will be in control by the on board computer but the ground of course will be the ones who send the commands. Prior to the upper stage burn while acquired by the tracking station at Guam, the crew will go through the disconnect from the LM and execute a separation maneuver getting away from it. What this little maneuver will consist of is about a 3 foot per second Delta-V slight out of plane, which initially sees the CSM arching a little below, behind and then above and all the time of course opening the distance between the two spacecraft. Later when that upperstage lights up the crew will be behind by probably about a half mile, to observe, to observe that depletion burn. On the box up here we have two types of ignitions, we're counting down the two types of ignitions at the present time we're about 10 minutes from the separation maneuver or the evasive maneuver as they sometimes call it, and we're about 30 minutes, a little over 30 minutes from that APS burn ignition. At 101 hours 22 minutes ground elapse time, this is Mission Control in Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 101 hours, 24 minutes, ground elapsed time. We approaching the tracking site at Guam and we expect to have some communication from air to ground between the Apollo 9 crew and mission control center here when we acquire. That should be in another 4 or 5 seconds. Meanwhile, let's monitor for any conversations.

Well, we went over the hill at the Guam tracking station just about time we had an indication or at least on the countdown clock here that they were to start their evasive maneuver. We will be back up at the Hawaii tracking site at 101 hours, 39 minutes or in another 6 or so minutes. This particular time, we'll again hear more on this APS depletion burn maneuver that is under way at the present time. At 101 hours, 33 minutes, this is mission control.
This is Apollo Control at 101 hours, 39 minutes. We have a few seconds before we have the acquisition at Hawaii, and at that time we should hear then if the evasive maneuver did indeed take place. It was scheduled just - scheduled to take place just as we lost acquisition at Guam, at the tracking site at Guam. So let's stand by now to monitor the conversations between the ground and the Apollo 9 crew.
HAWAII (REV 64)
101:39:45 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Hawaii.
101:39:48 Scott: Hello, Houston. This is Apollo 9. We were able to get that SEP maneuver off in the direction that we had intended. We did an automatic maneuver in the PGNCS that very carefully placed us gimbal lock, so we thrusted out to the side of it, and we have it in sight. We're all clear.
101:40:06 Evans: Roger. Understand you are well clear and we have a GO, then, for the LM maneuver.
101:40:12 Scott: Affirmative.
101:40:13 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
101:40:54 Schweickart: Houston, Apollo 9.
101:40:56 Evans: Houston. Go.
101:40:57 Schweickart: Roger. Could you refresh us on the burn time?
101:41:01 Evans: Roger. The burn time is at 52 plus 44.
101:41:05 Schweickart: Thank you. [Long pause]
101:41:36 Evans: 9, Houston. The burn time is really 53 plus 14. I can give you a clock time here at 11 minutes, or do you want it? [Pause]
101:41:47 McDivitt: Okay. [Long pause]
101:42:00 Evans: 15 seconds to 11 minutes.
101:42:02 McDivitt: Okay. [Pause]
101:42:11 Evans: 4, 3, 2, 1.
101:42:15 Evans: MARK.
101:42:16 Evans: Eleven minutes.
101:42:17 McDivitt: Roger. [Long pause]
101:43:02 Evans: 9, Houston. The LGC is all set up, and the engine is ARMED.
101:43:07 McDivitt: Roger. Very good.
Long comm break.
We've had an indication that the tracking station at Hawaii has lost the signal. We will pick up the Apollo 9 crew again in a little less than a minute at the - over the Redstone. We know that the separation maneuver took place well, and we heard the Commander say that he was off to the side. We would expect during the coming passes that we'll get a report on his separation, his distance, at the present time from the unmanned LN. Meanwhile, we will just continue to stand by here for we should have acquisition again in a matter of less than a minute.
We're about 5 minutes, 15 seconds from the burn and still standing by for any conversation between the ground and the crew.
The digitals which we have posted here indicate that the separation maneuver took place, the evasive maneuver took place well, adequately and in the general course of things at the present time the command service module is opening up the range between it and the unmanned lem, unmanned LM. And we're about 3 minutes and 37 seconds away from the ignition of that unmanned vehicle at this time. Meantime we'll stand by and continue to monitor any conversation which would be transmitted up to the crew.
GOLDSTONE (REV 64)
101:51:17 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. About 2 minutes to go; do you still feel comfortable in your position?
101:51:22 McDivitt: Oh, yes. We're well clear.
Less than a minute from ignition now of the LM and everything here at Mission Control looks go as they say, all systems are, on the LM are reported to be active and we're standing by for that burn which is now 40 seconds away.
101:51:23 Evans: Roger.

Had an indication of ullage.
That would have been a maneuver to settle the propellants in the LM.
And we have an indication of ignition.
Ullage off.
101:53:27 McDivitt: He's burning like mad, Houston. Looks real nice.
101:53:31 Evans: Very good; it's looking good down here.
101:53:34 Schweickart: Hey, it's really moving out. [Long pause]
Velocity's going up, apogee is going up.
Every thing looks good at the present time.
101:54:23 Scott: Houston, that engine's still burning away like mad.
101:54:27 Evans: Very good. We've got about 4-1/2 more minutes, and it looks like about the only thing we got is a very slight pitch oscillation. [Long pause]
Apogee at the present time is about 496 nautical miles and the speed is something on the order of 26 thousand feet per second. Going up now to 600 nautical miles.
101:55:03 McDivitt: We can still see out there, Houston. He's really a long ways away.
101:55:07 Evans: Okay. [Pause]
101:55:11 McDivitt: I hope I didn't forget anything onboard it.
101:55:14 Evans: We do, too.
101:55:18 Evans: Did you get the LMP?
101:55:20 McDivitt: No. I didn't forget him. I left him there on purpose. (Laughter)
101:55:24 Evans: Okay. [Long pause]
Apogee at the' present time is something on the order of 8 hundred and 78 miles.
101:55:38 Scott: And, Houston, we have fuel cell 2 warning light on.

101:59:20 Scott: Roger. He put out a big cloud of white stuff.
101:59:25 Evans: Roger. Copy.
101:59:27 Schweickart: He's sure a long ways away. [Long pause]
The preliminary figures indicate that the apogee was some 3700 plus nautical miles and the perigee will be about 124.
102:00:08 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9.
102:00:09 Evans: Houston. Go.
102:00:10 McDivitt: Roger. What time do you expect to give us the block data?
102:00:14 Evans: Roger. I'll give it over MILA at 57.
102:00:21 McDivitt: Okay. 102 57.
102:00:24 Evans: Roger. Negative. 101 57.
102:00:29 McDivitt: Alrighty. [Garble] 200.
102:00:30 Evans: Wait a minute. I've got the wrong data here. [Pause]
102:00:43 Evans: Be at MILA at 22.
102:00:45 McDivitt: Roger. 22.
Long comm break.
Apparently, they have momentarily passed out of range of the tracking stations. They should be back shortly. According to the preliminary information we are reading here, the apogee of the unmanned LM is 3,579 nautical miles and the perigee is 124 and the indications are that the LM reached 29,401 feet per second. At 102 hours and 2 minutes into the flight, this is mission control.
ANTIGUA (REV 65)
102:04:57 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Antigua. [Pause]
102:05:08 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Antigua. [Long pause]
102:05:46 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Antigua. [Long pause]
102:06:07 Schweickart: Houston, Apollo 9.
102:06:12 Evans: 9, Houston. I'll give you a couple of block datas here, and then we'll recompute them and give you everything with block data 12.
102:06:21 McDivitt: Okay. [Pause]
102:06:29 Schweickart: You're free to read them.
102:06:30 Evans: Okay. 065 4 Bravo, plus 338, minus 1699 102 56 23 4825; 066 3 Alpha, plus 312, plus 1446 l04 20 28 4821.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 102 hours, 16 minutes into the flight. The spacecraft is presently out of range of any of the tracking stations, however, just as it passed off the edge of the Antigua site we were able to record a few seconds of conversation and we're prepared to play that back for you now.
Well, LM is in its orbit now, its preliminary orbit of 100 - or 300 - 3759 nautical miles by about 124 nautical miles at the low point. We'll continue to track that unmanned vehicle until its battery power runs out. That's anticipated perhaps 3 to 6 hours from now. Incidentally, the FIDO was able to compute the burn duration and we had 5 minutes and 42 seconds of burn time with some tail off following that. One other interesting bit of information is that because of the high altitude the LM is flying at now, for example, a station at Ascension will acquire it - acquire it and be able to track it for some 55 minutes. And Tananarive likewise will acquire and track it for about 74, 75 minutes. At 102 hours, 19 minutes this is Mission Control.
TANANARIVE (REV 65)
102:36:58 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Tananarive.
102:37:02 McDivitt: Houston, Apollo 9. How do you read?
102:37:05 Evans: Oh, not too bad. Same thing from Tananarive. We'll try it, though.
102:37:10 McDivitt: We've got a couple of questions for you.
102:37:13 Evans: Roger. Go.
102:37:15 McDivitt: Okay. First, fuel cell 2 seems to be slipping down the power curve there; we're about 2 AMPS low on it. The PTU is still running high and kicking on the MASTER ALARM every once in a while. The other question is H2 pressures. Tank 1 is now registering about 261 or so and - oh, yes - 275. Tank 2 is about - Tank 1 is about 262, and tank 2 is about 275. [Pause]
102:37:56 Evans: Okay. I think that last thing you were talking about was H2 tank pressures, and if it's gone up above 26O, go ahead and turn them off. We plan to pump them up again tonight and let them decay while you are sleeping. [Pause]
102:38:17 Scott: Roger. We cut the heaters off on the H2 cryo. [Long pause]
102:38:41 Evans: 9, Houston. Are you still with me?
102:38:46 Scott: Houston, 9. We're broken. We've got the H2 heaters [garble] off at the present time.
102:38:52 Evans: Roger. Copy. We'll delete BATT A charge tonight.
Very long comm break.
GUAM (REV 65)
102:59:39 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Guam.
102:59:45 Schweickart: Roger. Hello. Houston, Apollo 9. Go ahead.
102:59:48 Evans: Roger. We have your state vector; we request P00 and ACCEPT.
102:59:55 Schweickart: Okay. You have P00 in ACCEPT.
102:59:58 Evans: Roger.
103:00:01 Scott: We didn't copy much over Pretoria and Tananarive. Will you say again what you were talking about on the fuel tells and the cryos?
103:00:10 Evans: Okay. I think you turned the H2 heaters off there, I hope.
103:00:16 McDivitt: That's affirmed.
103:00:17 Evans: And when you turned them off, did you go from the ON position, or from the AUTO position to OFF?
103:00:23 McDivitt: We went from AUTO to OFF.
103:00:25 Evans: Okay; afraid of that.
103:00:28 McDivitt: Didn't like that, huh?
103:00:29 Evans: No. [Pause]
103:00:33 McDivitt: Pressures were getting up pretty high. Do you want to go to ON now?
103:00:36 Evans: Okay. Let me tell you our plans now. What we'd like to do is take them on up to 275-270, sorry - by your MANUAL cycle and then heaters and fans OFF. We'd like to do that just as late as we can prior to your rest cycle. [Long pause]
103:00:55 McDivitt: Okay. We'll run them up to 270 and then turn them off and leave the heaters and fans off, too; is that right?
103:01:02 Evans: Yes; for the night. And we're hoping we can get a 12-hour decay there before we hit the MASTER ALARM again.
103:01:09 McDivitt: Okay; but you want to leave everything off overnight. Is that right?
103:01:12 Evans: That is affirmative.
103:01:14 McDivitt: Okay. [Pause]
103:01:20 Evans: Hey, you, might tell Jim we got a - Papa Alpha Tango and about three little ones here really proud of today's operations. [Pause]
103:01:31 McDivitt: What did you say, Ron?
103:01:33 Evans: I said we've got Papa Alpha Tango back there in the back room and three little ones, and they are really proud of today's operations.
103:01:41 McDivitt: Say hello to those four, would you, please?
103:01:45 Evans: Will do.
103:01:46 McDivitt: On second thought, I'll say hello. Hello, there. [Pause]
103:01:55 Evans: Okay, 9. We'd like to delete the BATT A charge.
103:02:01 McDivitt: Very well.
103:02:04 Evans: Okay. For RETRO's needs down here, he would like to know - We'd like to get a list of the non-checklist items that you left in the LM and also the non-checklist items that you might have brought back from the LM. [Pause]
103:02:23 McDivitt: Okay. Stand by one. [Pause]
103:02:31 Scott: And while you're standing by, how about the fuel cell, what do you think about that?
103:02:35 Evans: Okay. On the fuel cell, what we're hoping is that as soon as power down, the exhaust temperature - It should come down, and also it ought to even up the load again.
103:02:46 Scott: Okay.
103:02:48 Evans: We're not too hot about doing an H2 purge because - of course - it uses is little bit of hydrogen there.
103:02:56 Scott: Yes, that's true. Do you want to do any O2 purges tonight?
103:03:00 Evans: Whatever's on the flight plan.
103:03:02 Scott: Okay. We'll do an O2 purge.
103:03:06 McDivitt: Ron?
103:03:07 Evans: Go.
103:03:08 McDivitt: We left a left big bag - temporary storage bag - it's about 3 feet long and a foot wide and a foot thick over on the LM, and it was full of garbage; food wrappers and things like that. It didn't weigh very much, but it probably must have weighed 10 pounds or so. We didn't bring anything significant back with us in the way of weight. We do have a lithium hydroxide canister out of the [garble] and that's probably the heaviest item that we have, and we haven't found a place to stow it yet. Let me - It's probably [garble] down somewhere on the aft bulkhead. Probably down towards the lover equipment bay.
103:03:44 Evans: Okay. We copy that. [Pause]
103:03:51 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. How about the COAS - LM COAS, did it come back?
103:03:56 McDivitt: Oh, Roger. I got the LM COAS.
103:03:57 Evans: Okay. Good. [Pause]
103:04:04 McDivitt: I don't think we have anything that weighs anything, though. I tell you what we'll have to do, Ron. We brought the books back. We got all the checklist stuff back with us, but we didn't have time to sort out the numbers so we have two whole - That probably weighs another 5 or 8 pounds.
103:04:21 Evans: Okay. We understand that.
103:04:23 McDivitt: And we'll have to rearrange some of the things on the spacecraft, and we'll let RETRO know where we put them. Okay?
103:04:29 Evans: Okay. Good idea. [Pause]
103:04:41 Evans: 9, Houston. You've got it up there and we've checked and compared. So I've got a NAV check, but I don't think you'll need it.
103:04:50 Scott: Oh, if you say it's a good one, it's a good one. We'll take what we got.
103:04:54 Evans: Roger. Jim, a question to you. Did you do another OPS check, and if so, any results? [Pause]
103:05:03 McDivitt: I checked the OPS again, and the light still didn't come on.
103:05:07 Evans: Roger. Copy.
103:05:09 McDivitt: Yesterday Rusty checked it and he couldn't get - The light didn't come on. I went over and checked it again and it came on line. As a matter of fact, they came on four or five times. Then I went ahead and left it there, didn't say anything about it; I just thought we hadn't done it right. Went back over there today and they didn't work at all for either one of us.
103:05:26 Evans: Okay. [Long pause]
103:05:42 McDivitt: Houston. Check your middle gimbal. [Pause]
103:05:46 McDivitt: Roger. We see. We're going to power down the platform here in a minute.
103:05:49 Evans: Okay.
Long comm break.
HAWAII (REV 65)
103:15:18 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Hawaii.
103:15:23 Scott: Roger. Houston, Apollo 9. Go.
103:15:25 Evans: Roger. Got you loud and clear, now. Dave, while I've got you there, we haven't had any EKG on you all day, so when you - You might do a little troubleshooting here this evening sometime.
103:15:38 Scott: I'll tell you one reason you don't have it right now, is that I'm not plugged in.
103:15:42 Evans: Yes, but we didn't have any all day long on you, just on the EKG part of it. We had the respiration.
103:15:51 Scott: Let's square away the block data first, though.
103:15:53 Evans: Okay. We're working on the block data, and we should have it before we leave here.
103:16:01 Scott: Okay. I'll be all set.
103:16:04 Evans: By the way, our LOS of Texas is about 30.
103:16:09 Scott: Okay. [Pause]
103:16:13 Evans: We're curious if you might have any additional comments on the LM jettison there.
103:16:20 McDivitt: No. It went off pretty clean. We had a bang like a regular pyro, and pushed us back with a - I guess something like 4/10 of a foot per second. It's sort of hard to tell, but that's what it felt like; it was supposed to be. It looked like a clean separation, the docking ring looked clean, and we couldn't see too much of it because it went away pretty fast. And gosh, we must have been a mile a half away when it finally burned.
103:16:47 Evans: Okay.
103:16:49 McDivitt: The maneuver to the separation attitude didn't work out so good. I guess we never tried it in a simulator. We sort of slipped into gimbal lock, but I think we got to the right position.
103:17:03 Evans: Okay. [Pause]
103:17:04 McDivitt (onboard): Anything else?
103:17:06 McDivitt (onboard): The angles that we got were new and different, and we just were watching the LM, because [garble] ...
103:17:09 Evans: Okay. And by the way, the LM is in an orbit 37 - about 3750 miles by 125.
103:17:14 Scott: Oh really?
103:17:15 Evans: Yes. [Pause]
103:17:22 Evans: 9, Houston. We could also use some dosimeter readings.
103:17:25 Scott: We thought you'd probably ask for that.
103:17:27 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
103:17:36 Scott: Okay. Rusty's was 8012, and mine and Jim's are packed way down on the bottom of somewhere.
103:17:44 Evans: I Understand. 8012. Your waste water is up to about 90 percent now, so you may be wanting to dump that a little bit early.
103:17:52 Scott: Okay. We were going to do it at 104, but I guess we can do it here in a jiffy. Thank you. [Long pause]
103:18:51 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston. You might tell Jim that his guests can hear him now. They didn't hear him before.
Comm break.

103:22:06 Scott: Go ahead, Apollo 9. [Pause]
103:22:13 Evans: 9, Houston. You ready to go for block data on REV 66? [Pause]
103:22:20 Scott: Roger. You read?
103:22:21 Evans: Roger, I have you now.
103:22:23 Scott: I guess you didn't read me for a minute there. Okay. Go ahead; I'm ready.

And SPS trim: pitch, minus 0.89; yaw, minus 1.12. Over. [Pause]
103:26:15 Scott: Roger. I missed the first two lines of the one that came after area 069 Charlie Charlie - the next area. [Pause]
103:26:26 Evans: Okay. Area 070 Charlie Charlie latitude: minus 231. [Long pause]
103:26:40 Scott: And the longitude?
103:26:41 Evans: Longitude: minus 1600.
103:26:47 Scott: Okay. You ready to have them come back?
103:26:50 Evans: Roger. Go.
103:26:51 Scott: 066 3 Alpha, plus 312, plus 1446 104 20 28 4824; 067 3 Bravo, plus 338, plus 1485 105 54 57 48l6; 068 3 Alpha, plus 317, plus 1446 107 27 50 4789; 069 Charlie Charlie, plus 268, plus 1390 109 00 44 4786; 070 Charlie Charlie, minus 231, minus 1600 110 53 53 4540; 071 Charlie Charlie, minus 313, minus 1600 112 27 57 4310; 072 Alpha Charlie, plus 133, minus 0330 113 03 29 4748; 073 2 Alpha, plus 261, minus 0310 114 39 06 4827; 074 Alpha Charlie, plus 322, minus 0320 116 12 55 and 48559, with a pitch trim of minus 0.89 and a yaw trim minus 1.12.
103:28:32 Evans: Hey, good job.
103:28:35 Scott: You guys are getting more of these every day.
103:28:38 Evans: That's a good long one, there.
103:28:40 Scott: You must think we're going to stay up here forever. [Pause]
103:28:47 McDivitt: Hey, speaking of staying up here forever, what time are you going to wake up in the morning?
103:28:52 Evans: That's just what we're talking about here. We're just thinking maybe we'll let you know and we'll give you a call. You know.
TEXAS (REV 66)
103:29:00 McDivitt: That sounds like a good idea.
103:29:03 Evans: Okay. That's all we'll do. We'll just let you sleep, and we'll give you a call - or you give us a call whenever you want to. If we don't call you.
103:29:10 McDivitt: (Laughter) How about 304 7 Alpha Charlie?
103:29:15 Evans: Okay. By that time for sure. And just out of curiosity here, seeming you all sound pretty chipper up there. How you doing?
103:29:25 McDivitt: We're pretty good. As a matter of fact, none of us had anything to eat all day long except for the breakfast we had which was like 30 hours ago, I think. We're all in pretty good shape.
103:29:41 McDivitt: I think Rusty and I had an advantage over Dave because the water in the LM tastes better than the water in the command module.
103:29:46 Evans: Roger. And I guess no medication is on the thing. We've got about 30 seconds here - 10 seconds LOS and if you can give us the consumables through Tananarive, fine; otherwise forget it.
Very long comm break.
103:31:36 McDivitt (onboard): What's that? BAT B in PYRO A [garble].
This is Apollo Control at 103 hours, 32 minutes into the flight. The spacecraft at the present time has just moved out of the range of the tracking station at Texas, heading and it will cross eventually, South America. During that rather lengthy press conference that was just concluded, we have recorded the transmissions the air-to-ground from the Apollo 9 crew to the mission control center here in Houston. We are now ready to play that tape back to you. It's about 18 minutes long.
103:32:20 McDivitt (onboard): Oh, you know, we're supposed to put this -
103:32:27 McDivitt (onboard): Didn't want to reply.
103:32:37 McDivitt (onboard): That's right, Dave.
103:33:18 Schweickart (onboard): Hey, you know what I seem to do is [garble] you got to hold on. I hit the ceiling [garble].
103:33:27 Scott (onboard): [Garble] too bad you don't have the golden slippers.
103:33:30 Schweickart (onboard): Got a point. See the whole [garble]. If you lean backwards too long, [garble].
103:33:37 McDivitt (onboard): Is it really?
103:33:41 Scott (onboard): Go get your color picture.
103:33:46 Schweickart (onboard): Huh?
103:33:55 McDivitt (onboard): I got the [garble] CDH in the wrong direction [garble].
103:34:05 Scott (onboard): Yes, it was.
103:34:12 McDivitt (onboard): Yes, sir, that hurt [garble] got a program.
103:34:16 McDivitt (onboard): Yes. I know.
103:35:09 Schweickart (onboard): Whoopee!
103:42:31 McDivitt (onboard): I don't know; we just changed that one out.
103:49:48 McDivitt (onboard): No, it's the [garble] seems sort of hot, isn't it?
103:50:32 McDivitt (onboard): I just went through all my -
The guests referred to earlier in this transmission were the commanders wife and children. Astronaut McDivitt's wife and children, who remained at MCC until the loss of signal from the Texas station. While we have that tape playing for you, the flight controllers here estimated the systems life time on the unmanned LM, and they read something like this. The battery supplying the BUS at the commanders station is estimated now to be out of power at about 107 hours and 55 minutes and the single batteries are supplying power to the LM pilots station is estimated to be down at about 113 hours and 54 or 55 minutes. The water will be exhausted at around 110 hours and we would expect then that significant equipment degradation would occur some 3 or 4 hours after the water has exhausted. Meanwhile the command service module is approaching, approaching the Tananarive station and the LM is in the vicinity of well the far East at the present time. At 103 hours and 54 minutes this is mission control in Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 104 hours 6 minutes into the flight. The spacecraft, the Apollo 9 spacecraft, is at the present time approaching the tracking station at Tananarive, and we would think that there may be some conversation between the crew and the ground here in Houston. Probably the last conversation, if we have any for the night, because the crew I know are ready for a well-deserved rest. We'll be standing by to monitor any conversation between the, the crew and the ground.
TANANARIVE (REV 66)
104:08:08 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston through Tananarive.
Comm break.
104:08:14 McDivitt (onboard): Roger, Houston. We're still here.
104:08:26 McDivitt (onboard): Houston, Apollo 9.
104:09:15 Scott (onboard): Too late, huh? Did [garble] camera ever -
104:09:29 Schweickart (onboard): Sure. Just wind it around and look at the skies, and all that stuff.
104:09:36 Scott (onboard): You're right. I [garble]. That's kind of good.
104:09:41 Schweickart (onboard): Yes.
104:09:47 Scott (onboard): Besides, it's [garble].
104:09:50 Schweickart (onboard): Yes, I know. Yes, I was thinking about it.
104:09:53 Evans: Apollo 9, Houston.
104:09:58 Scott: Houston. 9.
104:10:00 Evans: Roger, Dave. We showed a CMC restart between our last state vector update and the Redstone pass. Did you power it down and then back up? [Pause]
104:10:14 Scott: Yes. We had it in STANDBY and we had our gimbal lock -
104:10:16 Scott (onboard): - light -
104:10:17 Scott: - on which had our PGNCS -
104:10:19 Scott (onboard): - light on.
104:10:20 Scott: - and we decided to go back to power everything up so we could get the IMU coarse aligned out of gimbaled lock so we wouldn't have our lights on during the night. Did we bomb you?
104:10:29 Evans: Roger. But we're satisfied now with the restart then.
104:10:34 Scott: Okay. We didn't get our restart light, though. [Pause]
104:10:38 McDivitt (onboard): Hey, Rusty.
104:10:39 Scott (onboard): He's [garble].
104:10:40 Evans: Roger. It's normal. It just adds our counter down here when you power up.
104:10:45 Scott (onboard): Oh, oh.
104:10:46 Scott: Yes; that's right. You have our reading on. Okay.
104:10:52 Evans: On the H2 pressures, if it looks like it's going to trigger the MASTER ALARM, we'll wake you up for a manual REPRESS, and then you can go back to sleep. [Pause]
104:11:03 Scott (onboard): Okay, fine.
104:11:05 Evans: We don't expect it, though.
Comm break.
104:11:06 Scott (onboard): Alright. You might have to holler a couple of times.
104:11:27 Schweickart (onboard): We're almost through with that one, Jim.
104:11:29 McDivitt (onboard): I know.

104:13:39 McDivitt: I thought the higher ground team was about as good as anything I've ever seen or ever hope to see. I want to congratulate you all.
104:13:48 Evans: Roger, Thank you very much.
Very long comm break.
Apparently the spacecraft has moved out of range of the tracking station at Tananarive and there will be no more air-to-ground. At 104 hours and 15 minutes Ground elapsed time this is Mission Control.

This is Apollo Control at 104 hours, 50 minutes ground elapsed time. The crew is in the rest period, as the spacecraft is on the 66th revolution. It's acquired by the tracking station at the present time. The spacecraft presently is flying at the following orbital parameters: 128.1 nautical miles at apogee and 121.9 nautical miles at perigee or the low point. It's time to complete an orbit is 89 minutes and 7 seconds. Spacecraft orbital weight at the present time is 27,100 pounds. The flight surgeon here at mission control reports that they have, the flight surgeon has not yet received any significant downlink data from the tracking station at Hawaii and the indication is that the crew is probably still closing out the spacecraft, doing final housekeeping duties in preparation for their rest cycle. At 104 hours, 52 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 105 hours, 51 minutes ground elapsed time. Spacecraft recently moved out of range of the Tananarive tracking station, having passed over that site about 8 or 9 minutes ago. Meanwhile, we're still tracking the LM upper stage. It was acquired by the Ascension station about 40 minutes ago. It still is in acquisition of Ascension, which indicates that it's very high altitude. As a matter of fact, orbital parameters at this time read 3747 nautical miles at apogee for the LM and 125.6 nautical miles at perigee. While the command service module was over Tananarive, we observed that the CSM's systems were functioning normally; however, we had no communication with the crew. They are in their rest cycle and so we'll keep the conversations with them to a minimum. They had a busy day today and are deserving of rest. So, at 105 hours, 52 minutes ground elapsed time, this is mission control.
This is Apollo Control at 106 hours, 51 minutes ground elapsed time. About 10, 12 minutes ago, the spacecraft was over the Hawaii tracking station on this, the 67th revolution, and at that time the surgeon, the flight surgeon here, received some bio-medical data which he interpreted was on the commander, Astronaut Jim McDivitt. The data included the mean heart rate which registered out in the average range of the 80s - 88 per minute. That lead the surgeon to conclude that while the astronaut was resting, ha was still not sleeping. We did not receive any data on respiration on that particular pass nor did we receive any data on the command module pilot or on Astronaut Schweickart. The cabin temperature in the spacecraft has remained stable at a comfortable 69 degrees Fahrenheit. The cabin pressure has remained at 4.9 pounds per square inch. Meanwhile the lunar module is still being tracked by mission control here, and it is presently over the Indian Ocean. At 106 hours, 53 minutes, ground elapsed time, all the spacecraft systems are functioning normal on the CSM. This is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo control at 107 hours 54 minutes ground elapsed time. Some 25 minutes ago the ground acquired the LM upper stage and got some date on it through the tracking station at Guam, and the flight controllers here reported that the primary guidance, navigation and control system on that upper stage now is inoperative, that system received its power from the battery supplying the bus at the, at the commander's station, and earlier it was predicted that, that particular battery's life time would end at about 107 hours there abouts GET. Guam data also confirmed that the unmanned LM upper stage now is sort of tumbling. The upper stage reached its perigee or low point of about 126 nautical miles near Guam, and now the LM is heading back up toward apogee. Antigua will acquire this unmanned vehicle for a short time in 2 or 3 minutes and after that the station at Ascension should acquire and it will have the LM for more than an hour. Meanwhile command service module with the resting Apollo 9 crew will come into range of the Hawaii station in another four or five minutes. At 107 hours 56 minutes this is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 108 hours 6 minutes ground elapsed time. During that short pass in which the station was acquired by the Hawaii tracking are in which the Apollo 9 spacecraft was acquired by the Hawaii tracking site. The ground here in Houston received some information on astronaut Jim McDivitt. His mean heart rate was in the 60 beats per minute range. Leading Dr. John F, Zeiglschmid who is the flight surgeon on this ship, to observe quote, "It looks like he's powering down his own platform. There was no biomedical data received on either Dave Scott or Rusty Schweickart. However the systems data that was transmitted down looked Ok and so the spacecraft is, seems to be functioning normally. AT 108 hours 7 minutes with the spacecraft over the Pacific Ocean this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control, 109 hours 18 minutes GET. Apollo 9 command and service module is approaching the tracking station at Guam with about 40 seconds left until acquisition. Because of some needs to balance the electrical loading in the various buses in the command module, there will be a brief call made to the crew to wake up at least one of them to change some switch positions in the spacecraft and also to adjust the computer into another mode so that the electrical load will be balanced. Just now the Flight Dynamics Officer, Ed Pavelka, came up and informed the mission commentator that the auxiliary computing room in the mission control center here had run some numbers out on the expected lifetime of the ascent stage of the lunar module and the lifetime predicted is 6904 days 23 hours and 41 minutes, which computes to be something in the neighborhood of 19 years. We're standing by here for the call by spacecraft communicator, Al Worden, on changing these switch positions in the cockpit, and hopefully after this brief interruption, the crew will get back to a much deserved rest. Apparently, we've run through an antenna keyhole here and a little delay in getting data from through the Guam station. Still standing by for the initial call to Apollo 9 through Guam. We've had solid lockon at Guam, standing by for the call. While we're waiting here for Al Worden's call to Apollo 9 we'll review the present status of the LM which is dying rather slowly. During these long passes over the station by the Lunar Module because of the high apogee which is about 37 hundred 45 miles. The various systems still appear to be percolating along, particularly the electrical system is still showing a peak voltage or normal voltage reading. To go back over the estimate of Lunar Module ascent stage lifetime as was run out by the auxiliary computing room here in mission control 6 thousand 904 days 23 hours 41 minutes, which is an excess of 19 years. The electrical and environmental and communications officer is still working up the plan for changing the switch positions to pass on to the spacecraft communicator. Before the call is made. Still standing by, it may be decided to postpone the call until a few minutes later either over Huntsville or over Mercury. There is only 40, as you were, 20 seconds remaining in the Guam acquisition and there has been no call yet. Apparently the call to the crew will be postponed until a later tracking section. At 109 hours 24 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control. 109 hours 50 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 9 presently is on the tail end of the 69th as you were 70th revolution in the South Pacific. Coming up on Ascension Island tracking station at 10 minutes past the hour. The wake up call discussed earlier has been scrubbed in the discussions here in the control center. It was decided to just let the switch positions stay as they are and if the situation on board warrents the caution and warning system will come on and wake up the crew anyhow and as it was described by Pete Frank at ah flight director would be rather like waking up a patient in the hospital so he could take his sleeping pill. At 109 hours 51 minutes ground elapsed time this in Apollo Control.
ASCENSION (REV 70)
110:11:31 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston. [Pause]
110:11:37 Scott: Houston, Apollo 9.
110:11:38 Worden: Roger. Did you just waken up there, Dave?
110:11:42 Scott: Roger [garble].
110:11:46 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston. I understand you got - Looks like we're seeing a MASTER ALARM down here. You've got a condenser exhaust temperature low on fuel cell 2, and we've got some recommended switching for you.
110:11:59 Scott: Okay. I've been watching that. Go ahead.
110:12:02 Worden: Okay. Dave. What we'd like you to do is put the CMC to OPERATE, and once you're in OPERATE, go to P00 and turn inverter 3 - place inverter 3 - on MAIN A. [Pause]
110:12:16 Scott: Okay. Bring CMC up to P00 and put inverter 3 on MAIN A.
110:12:20 Worden: That's firm, Dave.
Comm break.
110:13:26 Worden: Apollo 9, Houston. [Pause]
110:13:34 Scott: Go.
110:13:35 Worden: Roger. Apollo 9. Houston. While we've got you up, we're having a little trouble getting some down range. We'd like you to place the S-band at normal transponder, switch to OFF for 4 seconds, then to SECONDARY. [Pause]
110:13:53 Scott: Roger. S-band normal transponder to OFF, then into SECONDARY.
110:13:59 Worden: Roger. [Long pause]
110:14:39 Scott: Okay, Houston. We've got inverter 3 on MAIN A, and we're in P00.
110:14:44 Worden: Roger. Apollo 9, Houston. Thank you very much.
110:14:48 Scott: Thank you. [Pause]
110:14:58 Scott: How's everything doing down there?
110:15:01 Worden: Oh, pretty smooth down here except for watching condenser exhaust temperature vary a little bit on us. Sorry that you had to get awakened with the MASTER ALARM.
110:15:10 Scott: At least you're watching for us.
110:15:12 Worden: We're watching you.
110:15:15 Scott: Okey-doke.
Comm break.
110:16:58 Worden: Apollo 9. Houston.
110:17:02 Scott: Roger. Go ahead.
110:17:04 Worden: Roger. We're having some difficulty commanding downlink, and so we'd like you to go PCM bit rate to HIGH, and we'll just leave it that way for the rest of the night. [Pause]
110:17:17 Scott: All right, Houston. HIGH. [Pause]
110:17:24 Scott: [Garble].
110:17:27 Worden: Alrighty. Thank you, sir.
110:17:30 Scott: Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. 110 hours 21 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 9 presently is over the African continent at the beginning of the 70th revolution. During the just completed pass over the Ascension Island tracking station in the South Atlantic there was a brief conversation between the spacecraft communicator Al Worden here in mission control and command module pilot Dave Scott in discussing the electrical power loading switch settings and the standby mode of the command module computer, all of which had effects on the resulting amperage load on the spacecraft electrical system. Dave Scott responded in rather low tones to avoid waking his crew mates. We have accumulated about 3 minutes of tape of that conversation. Lets play that tape back now.
And this is Apollo Control at 110 hours 25 minutes. That completes the playback of the tape of the Ascension Island pass when which there was a brief conversation between spacecraft communicator Al Worden and command module pilot aboard Apollo 9 Dave Scott. At 110 hours 25 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 110 hours 50 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 9 is some 43 seconds out from the tracking station at Guam and the crew of Apollo 9 now has some 5 hours 9 minutes remaining in the rest period. Apollo 9 is midway through the 70th revolution and all systems apparently performing well during the most recent tracking we've had other than the earlier conversation over Ascension early in this revolution in which Dave Scott was requested to set the command module computer to OPERATE in Program 00 and put inverter 3 over to main BUSS A. This was to balance in the electrical systems onboard the spacecraft. At 110 hours 51 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control, 111 hours 55 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 9 is over North Central Africa, beginning of the 71st revolution, and has just left the acquisition area of the Canary Islands tracking station, the first such pass over the Canarys for this morning. The present orbital measurements of the command and service module: perigee 120.8 nautical miles, apogee 128 nautical miles, the calculated weight of the spacecraft is 27,026 pounds. The next station to acquire Apollo 9 will be the Guam station at 27 minutes past the hour. At 111 minutes - 111 hours 56 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control, 112 hours 50 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 9 is just leaving the tracking zone at the ship Mercury in the South Pacific near the end of the 71st revolution. The flight surgeon Ken Beers reported that during that pass Dave Scott, command module pilot, appeared to be awake according to the biomedical telemetry. We had a report earlier of the LM ascent stage on tracking at Ascension Island station where it appeared that the ascent stage was tumbling at the rate of 1 revolution each 84 seconds. Here in mission control the - one of the clocks has been set up for retrofire and nominal pre-mission flight plan retrofire time, this time will likely change as we get farther in toward the end of the mission. It now shows 125 hours 20 minutes until the orbit burn or SPS number 8. The next station to acquire Apollo 9 will be Canary islands at 22 minutes past the hour. At 112 hours 51 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control, 113 hours 50 minutes GET. Apollo 9 is midway through the 72 revolution over the subcontinent India. The next station to acquire the spacecraft will be Honeysuckle with 8 minutes past the hour. Recently it was attempted by the tracking ship Mercury to track the ascent stage of the LM, Lunar Module, and it was no joy in that case because apparently the Lunar Module's batteries have died, and of course the transponders and other equipment for tracking would not function without the electrical power. Earlier in that Lunar Module revolution the Honeysuckle station was able to get some tracking on the vehicle. And a recent pass over the Canary Island station earlier in this revolution the Apollo 9 cabin pressure was going 4.9 lbs per square inch. The cabin temperature of 72 1/4F. At 113 hours 51 minutes GET this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control. 114 hours 50 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 9 has just begun the 73rd revolution, is now over the Antigua tracking station of the eastern test range. Will go on over the tracking ship Vanguard in Mid Atlantic on into the Canary Island tracking station area. The awake time clock shows 1 hour and 9 minutes remaining in the crew rest period. The ignition time, which is a premission flight plan time and not necessarily the final time for retrofire or the SPS number 8 deorbit burn now shows 123 hours 20 minutes remaining until the end of the mission. At 114 hours 51 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 115 hours 50 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 9 is flying just north of the north island of New Zealand coming up on the tracking ship Mercury in just over a minute. The crew is still asleep at this time, the sleep period is scheduled to end in a little over 9 minutes, however, it is unlikely that the spacecraft communicator Al Worden here in Mission Control will call the crew until beginning of the Eastern Test Range pass at Antigua which begins 18 minutes past the hour. The countdown clock to retrofire de-orbit burn now shows 122 hours 20 minutes remaining in the mission. This retrofire time is subject to change but is based on the pre-mission flight plan. At 115 hours 51 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control, 116 hours 18 minutes GET. Apollo 9 is just passing across central America and we're standing by for a wake up call to the crew from spacecraft communicator Al Worden from Mission Control. This continuous pass across the lower end of the eastern test range, the tracking ship Vanguard, the station at Canary Islands, and Madrid. We'll have a total time of approximately 20 minutes. Still standing by for the wake up call. While we're waiting for the initial call from the spacecraft communicator, perhaps we can review the weather forecast in the contingency landing areas for today. The space flight meteorology group here at Mission Control has issued a forecast that reads that all landing zones for Apollo 9 will have satisfactory weather conditions today and tomorrow. In the primary landing zone in the West Atlantic, centered about 800 miles east of Jacksonville, partly cloudy skies are forecast with northwesterly winds at 20 knots and seas 4 to 6 feet. Temperature will range from 65 1/4 to 70 1/4. In the Mid-Pacific landing zone, centered about 600 miles northwest of Honolulu, skies will be partly cloudy and winds will be from the north at 15 knots. Seas are expected to be from 4 to 6 feet with temperatures 60 1/4 to 65 1/4. In the West Pacific landing zone, centered about 400 miles southeast of Tokyo, mostly cloudy skies will prevail, with winds 15 to 20 knots. Seas will be 4 to 5 feet with temperatures 60 1/4 to 65 1/4. In the East Atlantic landing zone, centered about 500 miles southwest of the Canary Islands, partly cloudy to cloudy skies are expected with southwesterly winds 15 to 10 knots. Seas 4 to 5 feet, with temperatures near 65 1/4. Cloudiness is not expected to affect the SO 65 multispectral photography experiments scheduled over the Southwestern United States and Mexico later today. To summarize the last 8 hours of the mission, since the Orange team came on, the team came on while the crew, or after the crew had begun the rest period at a little after 109 GET. The auxiliary room here in Mission Control had run out of estimate on the life time of the Lunar Module ascent stage, following the ascent engine burn to depletion during the day shift. They came up with a rather astounding number of 6,904 days 23 hours 41 minutes, which computes out to about 19 plus years. Later on over the Ascension station at 110 hours 20 minutes, there was an exchange between Dave Scott, in the command module, and Al Worden here in Mission Control on changing some switch positions to adjust the electrical loads in the spacecraft, also to put the command module computer in operate and program 00. Scott talked in rather a low tone to keep from waking his crew mates. Farther on into the shift, at 112 hours 20 minutes, the network controller reported that the Ascention track of the Lunar ascent stage showed that the stage was tumbling at a rate of about once each 84 seconds. The balance of the shift has been rather quiet with the crew continuing to sleep well. The spacecraft is well into the Antigua tracking station. We've had indication that the Vanguard has had acquisition of signal. Flight surgeon Ken Beers is observing the cardioscope and respiratory rates on his console to determine which crew men are awake, or if indeed they are awake. Continuing to monitor the air to ground circuit for any possible conversation here for this 20 minute pass. Members of the White team of flight controllers are beginning to drift in for the handover of the Orange team or sleep watch. Apollo 9 is approximately midway between the United States east coast line and the west coast line of Africa. Flight surgeon Ken Bears just advised spacecraft communicator Al Worden that it appears that the crew men are awake now and from the giggles on the cardioscope I would judge they are. Still standing by for the initial call. CAP COM is making his call now.
