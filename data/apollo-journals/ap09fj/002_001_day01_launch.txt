[It is 10:00 am EST [15:00 GMT] on March 3, 1969.]
[At launch pad 39A, the Saturn V launch vehicle AS-504 has
been fully loaded with propellants. The Apollo 9 crew entered their
spacecraft at around 8:30am [13:30 GMT] and the countdown to launch
at 11:00 am EST [16:00 GMT] is proceeding smoothly.]
[For detailed explanations of the launch of a Saturn V see the
descriptions of the Apollo
15 launch in the Apollo 15 Flight
Journal.]
Public Affairs Officer - "This is Apollo Saturn Launch
Control at T minus 59 minutes and counting, T minus 59 on the
Apollo 9 count. We are go for the mission at this time. Just a
matter of some 2 or 3 minutes ago, the Vice-President of the United
States, Mr. Agnew, arrived here in the Launch Control Center. The
Vice-President, who is of course the chairman of the Space Council,
here to observe the final 60 minutes or so of the count for Apollo
9. When the Vice-President arrived, he did meet some of the crews
for the upcoming launches, the complete crew for Apollo 10,
astronauts Tom Stafford, John Young, and Gene Cernan, and two of
the members of the Apollo 11 crew, astronauts Neil Armstrong and
Mike Collins. In the meantime, the three astronauts in the Apollo 9
spacecraft, Jim McDivitt, Dave Scott, Rusty Schweickart are
continuing to work on their final checks for this flight. McDivitt
and Schweickart at this time are performing some final checks of
the stabilization and control system. In the meantime, we are
starting to bring up radio frequency and telemetry checks with the
launch vehicle. All still going well at 58 minutes and
counting. Our countdown picked up following a 6-hour built in hold
at 2 a.m. Eastern Standard Time this morning and has run very
smoothly since that time. We've now been in progress a little more
than 8 hours with the count. The first 5 hours or so of our final
phases of the countdown list are devoted to the propellant loading
of the three stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle. During this
period, we brought in close to ¾ of a million gallons [3
million liters] of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen into the
stages of the Saturn V. We now have all our propellants
aboard, we have a vehicle on the pad that weighs some 6.4 million
pounds [2.9 million kg]. The propellants are all aboard at this
time, and the flight crew going through their final checks in the
spacecraft. During these 8 hours or so that we've been in the final
count, all aspects of the mission have gone very well. We had one
questionable item, that was a regulator for helium pressure in the
third stage of the Saturn V. We ran several verification tests
and were able to determine that a pneumatic control module in the
third stage is capable of performing its intended functions and we
are able to proceed. This module plays a part in preparations for
the second burn, particularly on the S-IVB, the third stage of the
Saturn V. Other than that one minor aspect, which was verified
by some tests during the count, all other aspects of the mission
have gone very well. The flight crew in Apollo 9 was alerted in
their countdown, as planned, at 5:45 a.m. Eastern Standard Time
this morning. They then went down the hall from their crew quarters
at the Kennedy Space Center and had a final physical. They were
declared in good physical condition and flight ready by Dr. Charles
A. Berry and a team of physicians giving the final
examination. Dr. Berry commented that the throats of the astronauts
really looked good this morning. Astronaut Rusty Schweickart, the
Lunar Module Pilot, did request to take a motion sickness pill and
he did take that while he was suiting up a little later in the
morning. Following their medical examinations, the astronauts sat
down for breakfast in the crew quarters, the usual astronaut menu
on launch day of scrambled eggs, steak, toast, orange juice, and
coffee. They had some seven guests with them at breakfast. The crew
then went to the suit room where they donned their space suits and
then were called to the pad some 10 minutes late, as we were a
little bit behind on bringing the propellants on board. The crew
departed from the crew quarters at 8:05 a.m. Eastern Standard Time
this morning and started to board the spacecraft at 8:29. The first
member of the crew across the sill was the Commander, astronaut Jim
McDivitt. He came across at 8:29 a.m. He was followed by the Lunar
Module Pilot, Rusty Schweickart, who sits in the right-hand seat,
some 5 minutes later, at 8:34, and the final member, Command Module
Dave Scott, who sits in the center seat, came aboard at 8:40
a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The backup Command Module Pilot,
astronaut Richard Gordon, was in the spacecraft during this period
aiding all three astronauts in coming aboard. Our countdown
continuing at this time, T minus 54 minutes 20 seconds. The
Vice-President now being briefed here in the Control Center by
Dr. Kurt Debus, who is director of the Kennedy Space Center. The
Vice-President is accompanied by Dr. Thomas Payne, the
administrator, the acting administrator of NASA, Dr. Robert
C. Seamans, the Secretary of the Air Force and former deputy
administrator of the space agency, and astronaut Frank Borman, who
was the Commander for the Apollo 8 mission. Those are some of the
key people in the Vice-President's party. Our countdown proceeding
at this time, all going well. Weather is go for the mission
also. We have a forecast of overcast in the Cape Kennedy, the
complex 39 area, but it is acceptable for launch. The hatch was
closed on the Apollo 9 spacecraft at about 9:20 a.m. this morning,
and our count has proceeded well since that time. We will go on
automatic sequence in the countdown at about 3 minutes and 6
seconds, and from that point on down, all phases of the count will
be automatic, leading up to ignition of the five engines and the
first stage of the Saturn V vehicle at the 8.9 second mark in the
count. This will be ignition sequence start, it will take some 8
seconds or so to build up the proper thrust in those five engines
to give us our planned 7.7 million pounds [34 million N] of thrust
at liftoff. All engines should be running at the 2 second and we
should get commit and liftoff at zero in the count. We are now at T
minus 52 minutes 40 seconds in counting, this is Launch Control."
Public Affairs Officer - "This is Apollo Saturn Launch
Control, T minus 49 minutes and counting. T minus 49; we are
proceeding satisfactorily at this time. At this point the Apollo
access arm, sling arm number 9 is being removed from the
spacecraft, being taken to its stand by position some 8 or 10 feet
away; it will remain in this position until we get to the 5 minute
mark in the count. In the meantime we are arming the pyrotechnic
devices aboard the spacecraft at this time, particularly the launch
escape tower, which could be used these final moments of the count
once the swing-arm is taken away. All aspects of the mission still
going well at this time and into a planned liftoff time on the
hour. T minus 48 minutes, 18 seconds and counting; this is Launch
Control."
Public Affairs Officer - "This is Apollo Saturn Launch
Control at T minus 44 minutes and counting, T minus 44, we are go
with the Apollo 9 mission at this time. Vice-President Agnew now
has taken his seat here in the control center and is monitoring the
countdown with a crew of some 450 people here in the Launch Control
Center, another 50 or so are back in the Spacecraft Operations here
at KSC and continue to work the countdown at this time. Standing by
in Houston, of course, and participating in the count are the
various teams there at the Mission Control Center under the flight
director. Our countdown now, some - running a little ahead,
especially on the spacecraft portion, and with the launch vehicle
they are coming up on one of our final major checks - final checks
of the destruct system aboard the three stages of the Saturn V
launch vehicle. These are checks with the Air Force Eastern Test
Range to assure that the destruct system aboard the vehicle would
be operable if it were required in flight. Of course, before taking
destruct action, the astronauts would go through an abort sequence
with their Apollo spacecraft to separate from the vehicle. Our
countdown proceeding satisfactorily, T minus 42 minutes 50 seconds,
and counting. This is Launch Control."
Public Affairs Officer - "This is Apollo Saturn Launch
Control T minus 39 minutes in counting. T minus 39 all aspects of
the mission still go at this time. A Capsule Communicator here in
the launch control center at firing room 2 - Jack Lousma who is a
member of the support crew - the astronaut support crew for the
Apollo 9 mission - now in some communication checks from his
console with the pilots onboard the spacecraft. Coming up shortly -
spacecraft wise, in about 5 minutes or so, will be pressurization
of the reaction control system for the Service Module of the
spacecraft. These are those quad thrusters - 100 pound [450 N]
thrusters in four quadrants around the Service Module that are used
for maneuvers in space - orbital maneuvers in the case of this
particular flight. On the launch vehicle side we're gearing up for
some final checks of the power system aboard the three stages an
instrument unit of the Saturn V - a power transfer test where we
check the flight batteries that then return to internal power -
correction - return to external power in order to conserve those
batteries down to the final moments of the count. T minus 37
minutes 51 seconds in counting - this is Launch Control."
Public Affairs Officer - "This is Apollo Saturn Launch
Control, T minus 34 minutes and counting. T minus 34; still
proceeding satisfactorily with the count at this time. We now have
just completed our pyro-transfer test; this is a test of the flight
batteries in the 3 stages of the Saturn V and the instrument
unit. Early indications are that the test went well. We will now
remain on external power till the 50 second mark of the count when
we finally go internal for good in the countdown. The astronauts
still preparing for the pressurization of their reaction control
system aboard the Apollo 9 spacecraft. We have the access arm, the
swing arm that enables entry to the spacecraft located some 12
degrees from the spacecraft in a standby position. For safety
purposes, we have 2 high speed elevators locked at the 320 foot [97
m] level; that swing arm could be brought back in rapid fashion if
required. It will remain in this position and not go back to its
fully retracted position until the 5 minute mark in the count. We
have now passed the 33 minute mark; we are at 32 minutes, 54
seconds and counting. This is Launch Control."
Public Affairs Officer - "This is Apollo Saturn Launch
Control T minus 29 minutes and counting, T minus 29. We are go for
a planned liftoff for Apollo 9 at this time. The Lunar Module,
which will be tested for the first time with a crew aboard in orbit
on this flight, now has gone on internal power. It is on the power
of its own flight batteries at this time and will remain in this
mode through the remainder of the countdown. The crew here in the
Control Center is continuing to monitor the status of the
propellants aboard in the Saturn V. We have now close to a million
gallons [3.8 million liters] of propellants, the vehicle weighing
some 6.4 million pounds [2.9 million kg] on the launch pad. The
astronauts aboard the spacecraft are going through the
pressurization sequences concerned with their reaction control
system, those are the thrusters on the Service Module that will be
used for maneuvers in orbit. Participating, primarily, Jim McDivitt
and the Lunar Module Pilot, Rusty Schweickart. We're still go and
we approach the 28 minute mark. Mark, T minus 28 minutes and
counting, this is Launch Control."
Public Affairs Officer - "This is Apollo Saturn Launch
Control at T minus 24 minutes and counting. T minus 24; the crew a
little ahead with their work on the spacecraft at the 320 foot [97
m] level. At this time, Rusty Schweickart, the Lunar Module Pilot,
decided he had time to ask on how the Lunar Module was doing, the
Lunar Module located beneath them now in the stack. The spacecraft
test conductors came on the circuit and reported that the Lunar
Module also is go and on internal power. The astronauts have
completed their pressurization and checks of the reaction control
system on the spacecraft Service Module; our countdown proceeding
smoothly at this time. 23 minutes, 20 seconds and counting; this is
Launch Control."
Public Affairs Officer - "This is Apollo Saturn Launch
Control T minus 19 minutes and counting, T minus 19. We are
bringing up our water supply now for the launch pad in preparation
for the ignition, which will come some 18 minutes 47 seconds from
this time. We have also completed readouts on the C-Band tracking
beacons which are located in the instrument unit and our checkout
still continues to go satisfactorily at this time. Despite the
overcast that we have, the visibility is good, the ceiling is
acceptable, we are go as far as weather is concerned on our launch
attempt for Apollo 9. We now have 2 complete follow-on crews also
observing the launch, the complete crew for Apollo 10 and now
Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 11, has
joined his two fellow pilots, so we have both complete crews here
along with the Vice-president and the dignitaries accompanying
him. We are coming up toward the 18 minute mark, a go for Apollo 9,
this is Launch Control."
Public Affairs Officer - "This is Apollo Saturn Launch
Control T minus 14 minutes and counting, We are still proceeding -
all aspects of the mission go at this time. The Apollo Command
Module now has gone on a full internal power - this is on the full
power of the fuel cells aboard. Actually the Command and Service
Module, of course, the complete spacecraft now on the power of its
fuel cells. Up to this time it had been sharing the load with an
external power source. Also at this time, the crew in the
spacecraft giving some readouts on the various power systems -
checking some final switch settings and arming those rotational
hand controllers that enable them to drive the vehicle in orbit in
the space mission itself. All aspects of the mission still
go. Thirteen minutes 15 seconds and counting - this is Launch
Control."
Public Affairs Officer - "This is Apollo Saturn Launch
Control, T minus 9 minutes and counting, T minus 9; we are still go
for our planned liftoff on Apollo 9. In progress at the present
time - there have been some final communication checks by some key
individuals here at the control center, as well as the flight
director, Gene Kranz and the Capsule Communicator Astronaut Stu
Roosa in Houston. We have made some final checks on what is known
as the astro-launch circuit; this is a special circuit which is
several key people talk to the flight crew aboard the spacecraft
over the final few minutes of the count. The crew switches to
astro-launch at the 4 minute mark in the count. Just a handful of
people and key people talking to them from that time on for the
remainder of the count; it will be the spacecraft conductor, his
name is Skip Sheldon, the launch operations manager, Paul Donley,
and the Capsule Communicator here in the Control Center, the backup
support astronaut, a member of the support team, Astronaut Jack
Lousma. The flight director in Houston also has the capability to
talk to the astronauts, We are now past the 8 minute mark in the
count; spacecraft test conductor Skip Sheldon going through a final
status check of all of his systems, the report coming back go at
this time. As we proceed, T minus 7 minutes 45 seconds and
counting; this is Launch Control."
Public Affairs Officer - "This is Apollo Saturn Launch
Control T minus 5 minutes and counting, T minus 5, and the order
has been given for the Apollo Access Arm to come to its fullest
retracted position and now swing arm number 9 coming back to its
fully retracted position. Just before this order was given, we went
through a final status check. This spacecraft is go, we also got a
go for launch from Mission Director George Hage in Houston, and
finally Launch Director Rocco Petrone, here in firing room 2. Our
status board shows launch support preparations are complete, and
the ready lights are on for the instrument unit, the spacecraft,
and the emergency detection system. We are go at T minus 4 minutes,
21 seconds and counting. This is Launch Control."
Public Affairs Officer - "This is Apollo Saturn Launch
Control coming up on 3 minutes 50 seconds, Mark, T minus 3 minutes
50 seconds and counting, we are go for launch. The countdown now
turned over to the control of the launch vehicle conductor for the
last 4 minutes of the count. We will go on an automatic sequence
starting at 3 minutes 7 seconds. Final communications checks now in
progress between the spacecraft test conductor and the crew aboard
the spacecraft. Some final checks in progress at this time. We have
the report that we are clear for firing command, that is the
automatic sequencer that should come in in about 15 seconds. From
that time on down, all aspects of the mission will be automatically
monitored by the computers here at the control center and at the
pad. At 3 minutes 10 seconds, we have firing command. Launch
sequence started, the computer is in, the sequence is in at this
time. Mark, T minus 3 minutes, T minus 3 minutes and counting. Our
preparations are now complete, our ready lights are on here in the
Control Center. During this period the various propellant tanks
aboard the three stages of the Saturn V will be
pressurizing. Primarily we use helium on the ground to pressurize
these tanks. The various vent valves will close, as the countdown
proceeds. We are now past 2 minutes 35 seconds, and counting, all
still going well. 2 minutes 30 seconds, we should be getting an
indication on pressurization of the third stage. We have it, here
in the Control Center 2 minutes 20 seconds and counting, the third
stage now is pressurized. We will be looking toward those 5 engines
in the first stage of the Saturn V, the ignition sequence to start
at the 8.9 second mark in the countdown. We are now coming up on
the 2 minute mark, Mark T minus 2, all aspects of the mission still
go at this time. The Apollo 9 crew standing by in the spacecraft. 1
minute 50 seconds and counting. Once the ignition sequence does
begin with the 5 engines it will take some 9 seconds or so to build
up the proper thrust. The computers will automatically sample those
engines and assure ourselves that we have 95 percent of the
thrust. We will get a commitment at that time, and the 4 hold-on
arms will come back. We are now 90 seconds and counting, 90 seconds
and counting. Vice-president Agnew now has come up to the window of
the Launch Control Center, along with members of the party to view
the launch. 1 minute 20 seconds and counting. All indications are
we are still go at this time. Third stage propellant tanks have
been pressurized. Final check of several panels by Lunar Module
Pilot Rusty Schweickart, second stage tanks now
pressurized. Schweickart confirms that he has the proper
readings. 1 minute and counting."
Public Affairs Officer - "T minus 55 seconds and
counting. All still going well, we are coming up on the power
transfer. Mark 50 seconds and counting, we're now on internal power
with the three stages and instrument unit of the Saturn V. All
propellant tanks in the second stage now pressurized. 35 seconds
and counting, the vehicle now completely pressurized, the vents
closed, we are go, 30 seconds and counting. T minus 25 seconds and
counting, all aspects still go at this time as the computer
monitors. Twenty seconds, guidance release, ..."

I don't know if he read that.
000:03:56 McDivitt:
Houston, did you read our comment that our SPS helium pressure went
to zero? Indicated zero at lift-off?
Public Affairs Officer - "The cabin is stable at 6.1 pounds
per square inch [42 kPa]."
000:04:07 Roosa:
Apollo 9, this is Houston. I did not copy.
000:04:10 McDivitt:
Roger; be advised our SPS helium pressure went to zero at lift-off.
000:04:15 Roosa:
Roger; copy.

Roger. It is go here, Apollo 9.
000:04:24 McDivitt:
Very good.
[Long pause.]
Public Affairs Officer - "Jim McDivitt reports the SPS
helium pressure on board went to zero at liftoff; however, we are
reporting go here at the Mission Control Center. 225 [nautical]
miles [417 km] downrange, 75 [nautical] miles [139 km] high, 11,700
feet per second [3,570 m/s]."
000:04:28 Schweickart (onboard):
That might be a circuit breaker, Jim.
000:04:30 McDivitt (onboard):
Yes, okay.
000:04:31 Schweickart (onboard):
I'll check it later. The systems look good.
000:04:34 McDivitt (onboard):
Yes, everything looks hunky-dory! If we just got --
000:04:36 Schweickart (onboard):
The boiler's working.
000:04:38 Scott (onboard):
RCS is good, Jim.
000:04:40 McDivitt (onboard):
Fine.
000:04:45 Scott (onboard):
Holding low and parallel.
000:04:46 McDivitt (onboard):
Okay.
000:04:52 Schweickart (onboard):
Boy, that cut-off - That's a hell of a cut-off, isn't it?
000:04:54 McDivitt (onboard):
Yes, not bad. There's that horizon. Boy, is that pretty! Wow!
000:05:00 Scott (onboard):
You're not supposed to say that, you've been here before.
000:05:01 McDivitt (onboard):
Beautiful!
000:05:02 Roosa:
And, Apollo 9, it's 5 minutes, and everybody is as happy as a clam
here. Looking good.
000:05:05 McDivitt:
So are we.
[Long pause.]
000:05:06 McDivitt (onboard):
Whooee!
000:05:07 Scott (onboard):
Coming up on the big word, Jim.
000:05:09 McDivitt (onboard):
Okay.
000:05:12 Schweickart (onboard):
Boy, that S-band is really noisy.
000:05:15 McDivitt (onboard):
Is it?
000:05:16 Schweickart (onboard):
Yes.
000:05:21 Scott (onboard):
I'll give you a standby, buddy.
000:05:22 McDivitt (onboard):
Okay. Align all - all the pieces all the way.
000:05:38 Scott (onboard):
We're coming right back in, Jim.
000:05:39 McDivitt (onboard):
Very good! Looks good!
000:05:41 Scott (onboard):
Very good.
000:05:42 Schweickart (onboard):
Shoot!
000:05:44 McDivitt (onboard):
God, that's pretty!
000:05:45 Schweickart (onboard):
That's terrible!
000:05:46 McDivitt (onboard):
That's so pretty, I can't believe it!
000:05:51 Schweickart (onboard):
If it keeps making that noise, I'm going to turn it off.
000:05:55 McDivitt (onboard):
Looks bad, Rusty?
000:05:57 Schweickart (onboard):
Well, it - it's stopped now.
000:05:58 McDivitt (onboard):
Okay, we're coming up on 6 minutes, so you can get ready for your antenna shift.
000:06:03 Schweickart (onboard):
Yes, I'm all set for it.
000:06:09 Schweickart (onboard):
Okay, 16 Omni (garbled) --
000:06:11 Scott (onboard):
Okay. Give a yes (garbled) --
000:06:12 Roosa:
Apollo 9, you have S-IVB to orbit capability.
000:06:15 McDivitt:
Roger here. Roger here.
Public Affairs Officer - "Mark S-IVB to orbit capability. If
the second stage shuts down prematurely, we do have the capability
to put the spacecraft into orbit with the S-IVB."
000:06:17 Roosa:
Your level sense arm time is 08 plus 21; predicted S-II cutoff 08
plus 56.
000:06:22 McDivitt:
08:21 and 08:56.
000:06:25 Schweickart:
Roger; and we got S-Band Omni to Delta.
[The technical transcription has this transmission by McDivitt.]
000:06:27 Roosa:
Copy. Omni Delta. Thank you.
[Long pause.]
Public Affairs Officer - "We are estimating cut-off of the
S-II stage at 8 minutes 55 seconds. We are at 6:30 now, still go,
430 [nautical] miles [800 km] downrange, 90½ [nautical]
miles [168 km] high, and 15,300 feet per second [4,660 m/s]
velocity."
000:06:41 Schweickart (onboard):
Systems look good. Just boiling away. Look at that (garbled)
[Onboard transcription break.]
000:06:55 Schweickart:
And the rookie says that looks beautiful.
[Communications have been switched to Bermuda.]
000:07:01 Roosa:
And rookie, at 7 minutes, everything is going real great.
000:07:05 Schweickart:
Roger.
[Long pause.]
Public Affairs Officer - "A little word from rookie
Schweickart there."
Public Affairs Officer - "18,000 feet per second [5,500 m/s]
velocity now, 590 [nautical] miles [1,090 km] downrange, 96
[nautical] miles [178 km] high."
000:08:04 Roosa:
Apollo 9, at 8 minutes everything is go.
000:08:08 McDivitt:
Roger, Everything looks fine here, too.
000:08:10 Roosa:
Very good. The comm is beautiful, Jim. You are really coming
through clear, I read you nice and -
000:08:15 McDivitt:
Roger. Your comm is nice and clear and loud too, Smokey. We had no
trouble with comm on launch at all.
000:08:25 Roosa:
Roger. Copy that, Apollo 9, and you are go for staging.
000:08:29 McDivitt:
Roger, getting a little vibration. About eight -
[Long pause.]
Public Affairs Officer - "Apollo 9 has a go for staging
now. Looking for S-II cutoff about 8 plus 55. Retro reports were
right on ground track."
