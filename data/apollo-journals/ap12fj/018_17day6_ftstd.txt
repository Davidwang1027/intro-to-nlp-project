139:03:02 Conrad: Houston. Intrepid, picking up the launch Prep Verb 98 at LO minus 02:50.
139:03:11 Gibson: Roger, Intrepid.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control Houston. We're at 139 hours, 5 minutes into the flight. Meanwhile in Mission Control Center Houston, we are having a shift change. Flight Director, Pete Frank, and members of his Orange Team are now aboard, and a News Conference will be held in the News Center within the next few minutes with Flight Director, Gerry Griffin. We're at 139 hours, 6 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control Houston.

139:14:05 Conrad: Go.
139:14:07 Gibson: We have a update on the star Ar - Arcturus on page 102 of the Surface Checklist. We'd like you to use Procyon, 16, or Sirius, 15, and that's detent 1. [Pause.]
139:14:34 Conrad: Roger. [Pause.]
139:14:41 Conrad: Okay. And we passed self-test all right.
139:14:48 Gibson: Roger.
139:14:54 Conrad: Are you ready for E-Mod dump?
139:14:58 Gibson: That's affirmative. We're ready for the E-Mod.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 139 hours, 15 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 12. We're some 2 hours, 50 minutes away from Time Of Ignition and Conrad and Bean start turning their attentions to preparations for liftoff. Both guidance systems, the prime and backup are powered up and systems tests are performed. The 2 guidance systems are aligned, the AGS to the PNGS, the rendezvous radar will be turned on, and the self test is performed, the inertial platform.
The inertial platform is aligned for the rendezvous radar tracking of Yankee Clipper on its last overhead pass, this pass prior to lift-off. The radar is turned off following this and remains off during ascent. At this time we will turn the release line over for a News Conference at the News Center. The tape will be turned over directly to transcript. We're at 139 hours, 15 minutes into the flight; and this is Apollo Control Houston.

139:20:09 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. Loud and clear.
139:20:14 Gordon: Well, hello there, stranger. How are you?
139:20:22 Carr: Morning, Dick. We are fine. How are you?
139:20:27 Gordon: Well, pretty good. I hope you would like to have some company for a change.
139:20:31 Carr: Roger. Got the house clean?
139:20:36 Gordon: As a matter of fact, I just finished that. I sure do; got everything in order; ready to go towards the LM and bring back [garble] that's quite a chore; keeping this thing clean.
139:20:53 Carr: Roger. You got a couple of coal miners coming up to see you.
139:20:59 Gordon: That's okay. I'll be glad to see them.
139:21:10 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. The computer is yours. Break. Yankee Clipper, if you will go P00 and Accept, we have an uplink.
139:21:20 Gordon: All yours.

139:23:14 Conrad: Houston, you got the lift-off time for me?
139:23:20 Carr: Stand by. [Pause.]
139:23:39 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Your lift-off time is l42:03:47.
139:23:52 Conrad: I copy 142:03:47.00.
139:23:57 Carr: Affirmative.
139:24:05 Carr: Clipper, Houston. Computer's yours.
139:24:11 Gordon: Okay. And Jerry, will you find out what they want to do about this battery charge, because I'm using the bus ties during the rendezvous?
139:24:23 Carr: Roger.[Long pause.]
139:24:43 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. Why don't you figure on terminating the battery charge at LOS?
139:24:52 Gordon: All right; I could let it go until I [garble] just before lift-off. That way it might take it all the way up.
139:25:33 Carr: Clipper, Houston. We prefer that you terminate at LOS on this pass.
139:25:40 Gordon: Roger.
139:25:41 Carr: Roger. That would be one less thing for us to keep track of prior to lift-off.
139:25:48 Gordon: Okay.

139:27:17 Conrad: Say, Houston; Intrepid.
139:27:20 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Go.
139:27:25 Bean: Roger. When you look out the AOT in the dark quadrant? You can see these lights - particles of light, flashes of light just seem to come from - in this case, I'm looking in quadrant 1 which is the left one. It's coming from behind me, the left, and they're just sailing off in space. I was thinking they're dropping from my water boiler, but it looks like some of those things are escaping the Moon. They really haul out of here and just press off at the stars.
139:27:56 Carr: Roger. [Pause.]
139:28:25 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston with a P22 tracking PAD.
139:28:42 Gordon: Go ahead.
139:28:44 Carr: Roger. Your target is LM; T-1 is 139:57:39; T-2 is 140:02:38; south 05; latitude is minus 3...
139:29:10 Gordon: Roger. T 112...
139:29:13 Carr: Latitude, minus 3.036; longitude over 2 is minus 11.709; altitude minus 1.13. If you want to take photos, your DAC settings are 1/60th, 1 over 60, one SP, 1 FPS, and C-EX film. You're - you should be at zero local horizontal rather than 22-degrees pitchdown. Over.
139:30:04 Gordon: Roger. Understand. T-1, 139:57:39, T-2, 140:02:38, 5 miles South, latitude is minus 3.036, longitude over 2 is minus 11.709; altitude minus 1.13 and [garble] information. I will not use it.
139:30:34 Carr: Roger, Dick. And I've got a Rev 30 map update when you're ready. [Pause.]
139:30:50 Gordon: Go ahead.
139:30:51 Carr: Roger. Rev 30, LOS 140:31:05; 140:56:06, 141:17:20.
139:31:20 Gordon: Roger. Yankee Clipper, we copied.
139:31:22 Carr: Okay. And, Dick, I've got your consumables update when you are ready.
139:31:30 Gordon: Go ahead.
139:31:32 Carr: Roger. At a GET of 139 plus 20, RCS total was 56 percent; Alfa is 58; Bravo, 56; Charlie, 56; Delta, 55; hydrogen tank 1 is 49.9; tank 2 is 49.8; oxygen, 52.7 and 54.4. Over.
139:32:14 Gordon: Roger. I copy that. And my rendezvous radar transponder self-check is okay.
139:32:25 Carr: Roger.
139:32:57 Gordon: Hey, Jerry, I would like to have a DAP update also, please.
139:33:06 Carr: Roger, Dick. Stand by. We'll get it for you. [Long pause.]
139:34:06 Conrad: Okay, Houston. Looking at the DSKY torquing angles?
139:34:13 Carr: Roger. We see them, Pete.

139:39:19 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. If you'll give us P00 and Accept, we have another LM state vector for you.
139:39:29 Gordon: Okay, Houston. I'm going to stop my roll [garble] here. Okay. Go ahead.
139:39:34 Carr: Roger. [Long pause.]
139:40:20 Conrad: All right, Houston. Is there any objection if we track him when he goes by this time? And do you have the OSCIL[?], or don't you want us to do it?
139:40:36 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. We hadn't really planned on doing a P22 on this pass.
139:40:45 Conrad: Okay. We'll forget it.
139:40:50 Carr: Okay. Break. Yankee Clipper, Houston. I've got your DAP update.
139:41:00 Gordon: Sock it to me.
139:41:02 Carr: Okay. About the only change you need is you need to go to 0.5-degree deadband, so R1 should read 1110.1.
139:41:27 Gordon: Okay. Are the weights and trim verified yet?
139:41:35 Carr: Roger, Dick. Your weights and your trims are good.
139:41:41 Gordon: Okay. That's what I was worried about. Thank you. I'll probably go to a half a degree a second during the rendezvous because those maneuvers are pretty long.
139:41:49 Carr: Roger.
Comm break.
139:42:58 Carr: Houston, Clipper. Never mind. Forget it.
Comm break.
139:44:21 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. We're through with your computer.
139:44:28 Gordon: Roger. Thank you. [Long pause.]
139:44:59 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. On your maneuver, go S-band Omni Charlie. Over.
Comm break.
And no we're at 139 hours, 49 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 12. In Mission Control Center, Houston, we've had a change in the capsule communicators. Jerry Carr, now aboard replacing Ed Gibson at that position. While the line was down Pete Conrad from the Intrepid did call and ask for a lift-off time. Jerry did pass...
139:49:20 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. Omni Delta.
139:49:29 Conrad: Houston, Intrepid.
Your browser does not support the audio element. Download MP3 audio file. Scrivener tape, Australia.
139:49:32 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Go.
139:49:37 Conrad: Has Yankee gone overhead yet?
139:49:43 Carr: Not yet, Pete.
139:49:48 Conrad: Give me an overhead time, so I can watch him go by.
139:50:08 Gordon: Take T-2 and add 96, Jerry. [Long pause.]
Jerry Carr did pass along an estimated lift-off time. We're 142 hours, 3 minutes, 47 seconds. Our displays in Mission Control show us that Intrepid should enter orbit with an apolune of 46.3 nautical miles, a perilune of 8.8 nautical miles. Delta-V for that ascent burn would be 6,057 feet per second. About 1½ hours before lift-off, Capcom Jerry Carr will be passing the lift-off maneuver pad to Intrepid. Presently we're at 2 hours, 13 minutes prior to ignition; at 139 hours, 56 minutes continuing to monitor. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
139:51:01 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Clipper should be overhead at 140:04:10.
139:51:17 Conrad: Okay. Thank you. I'm going to check the plane change and see how good you are. [Long pause.]
139:52:08 Gordon: Houston, Yankee Clipper. Is Intrepid up VHF?
Your browser does not support the audio element. Download MP3 audio file. Scrivener tape, Australia.
139:52:15 Carr: Stand by, Clipper. Break. Intrepid, this is Houston. Clipper wants to know if you're up VHF.
139:52:24 Conrad: No, but we will come up VHF.
139:52:28 Carr: Roger. Break. Clipper, Houston. Intrepid says he'll be up.
139:52:35 Gordon: Okay. Ask him whether he wants us up VHF A or B Simplex.
139:52:40 Carr: Clipper, Houston. What would you like, VHF A or B Simplex?
139:52:46 Gordon: [Garble] go on normal VHF ranging.
139:52:51 Carr: Say again, Clipper.
139:52:57 Gordon: How about the normal VHF ranging [garble]?
139:53:06 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Come up on VHF ranging configuration. Over.
139:53:15 Conrad: Will do.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston. We presently show Yankee Clipper in an orbit of 61.7 nautical miles by 58.7 nautical miles. We're now at 139 hours, 53 minutes into the flight. This is Apollo Control, Houston. We're at 139 hours, 58 minutes now in the flight. Our display here in Mission Control shows that the concentric sequence initiate burn...
139:58:19 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston.
139:58:24 Gordon: Go ahead.

139:58:26 Carr: Roger, Dick. Are you going to use the zero-degree pitch or 22-degree pitch down for this pass?
139:58:33 Gordon: Twenty-two degrees.
Long comm break.
Flight Plan, page 3-119.
The concentric sequence initiate burn is scheduled for 143 hours, 1 minute, 50 seconds with a Delta-V of 49.2 feet per second. This burn done at apolune following lift-off has the effect of raising the perilune a half a revolution later. We would look at numbers at that time for Intrepid of 46.8 by 43.6, some 15 nautical miles below the Yankee Clipper. We're 2 hours, 4 minutes, 18 seconds away from Time Of Ignition. And this is Apollo Control, Houston.
140:04:53 Conrad: Hello, Yankee Clipper; Intrepid on VHF. How do you read?
140:04:59 Gordon: Loud and clear, Pete. [Long pause.]
140:05:37 Gordon: Hello, Houston; Clipper.
140:05:45 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. Go.
140:05:50 Gordon: Roger. Houston, I don't like those marks at all, that Sun angle was pretty high and the whole area is washed out, and it's the best that I could tell you, I think I was on the Surveyor crater but I can't be sure of that.
140:06:08 Carr: Roger, Dick.
140:06:13 Gordon: That Sun's a lot too high to define that right now.
140:06:16 Conrad: Houston, Intrepid. We had a visual on him although I couldn't talk to him on VHF.
140:06:25 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Roger.
140:06:29 Carr: Clipper, this is Houston. Did you read Intrepid on VHF?
140:06:36 Gordon: That's affirmative.
140:06:39 Carr: Roger. You sure it wasn't in S-band because, you know, we're in a relay mode.
140:06:49 Gordon: Houston, Clipper. I think it's VHF, Jerry.
140:06:57 Carr: Okay. [Long pause.]
140:07:56 Gordon: Hey, Jerry, I sure wouldn't do anything with that P22 data because I'm not sure of it.
140:08:04 Carr: Roger, Dick. We've copied your data.
140:08:23 Carr: Clipper, Houston. We'll give that data a good evaluation before we do anything with it.
Comm break.
P22 reference there is the orbital navigational program for the Command Module, Yankee Clipper. We're at 140 hours, and 9 minutes now into the flight and 1 hour and 55 minutes away from Time Of Ignition for Intrepid.
140:09:25 Bean: Houston, Intrepid.
Your browser does not support the audio element. Download MP3 audio file. Scrivener tape, Australia.
140:09:30 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Go.
140:09:34 Bean: Got sort of an interesting thing going on AGS right now. I didn't notice earlier, but it may just be because the lights are brighter now. I'm getting an all 8's flash on both the address and the information registers at about one-fifth the brilliance of the normal numbers. And a - it's pulsing every second.
140:10:00 Carr: Roger, Al.
140:10:06 Bean: If I turn down the illumination level just a little bit, it's not noticeable. [Long pause.]
That was Al Bean describing some illumination on his AGS display, the abort guidance system display aboard Intrepid.
140:10:52 Bean: Hello, Houston; Intrepid. You ready for my RCS hot fire?
140:10:59 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Roger. Fire away.
140:11:03 Conrad: Okay.
140:11:32 Carr: Intrepid, Houston.
140:11:37 Bean: Go.
140:11:39 Carr: Roger, Al. Fredo is here. He and I have both seen that phenomena on your DEDA during testing of most all the spacecrafts up at Bethpage, and it's probably an EMI.
140:11:56 Conrad: That's what we've been talking about, but we thought we'd just touch in on it.
140:11:59 Bean: When you go to your roll rate, roll left, pitch up...
140:12:01 Carr: Roger. I think TRW's got a workup on this problem.
140:12:08 Conrad: Okay.
140:12:11 Conrad: Here you go, Houston, with roll, pitch, and yaw.
140:12:14 Carr: Roger, Pete. [Long pause.]
140:12:48 Carr: Intrepid, Houston.
140:12:53 Conrad: Don't panic. We just blew over our S-band erectable, and we're up on our steerable.
140:13:02 Carr: Roger. I was just going to tell you, Pete, we lost some of the data on that fire check.
140:13:11 Conrad: Okay. You want me to give to you again?
140:13:13 Carr: Stand by. I'll tell you what we need.
140:13:15 Conrad: I never gave you yaw anyway.
140:13:19 Carr: Pete, can you just start over from the beginning?
140:13:25 Conrad: Okay. [Long pause.]
Apparently from that last report the erectable S-band antenna outside was felled by that RCS test. We're at 140 hours, 14 minutes.
140:13:45 Conrad: Pitch up is the only one that didn't sound right.
140:13:51 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. I've got a K-factor update for you when you're ready.
140:13:58 Conrad: Okay.
140:14:01 Carr: Roger. R-1 is 00140; R-2 is all zips, R-3 is 00033.
140:14:16 Conrad: Okay. 000 - 00140; all zips; three zips 33.
140:14:23 Carr: Roger.
140:14:30 Conrad: Okay. How'd the hot fire look?
140:14:39 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. That went kind of fast. Give us a chance to take a look at our tapes.
140:14:47 Conrad: Okay.

140:15:50 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. The passive seismometer just verified that you did do your hot fire.
140:16:01 Conrad: Very good.
140:16:18 Conrad: Does the passive seismometer say my hot fire is Go? [Long pause.]
This is Apollo Control Houston. Jerry Carr reported recordings of the panel on the passive seismometer verifying the hot fire on the RCS. This data was received in our Experiment Staff Support Room.
140:16:50 Gordon: Houston, Clipper.
140:16:54 Carr: Clipper, Houston. Go.
140:16:59 Gordon: Okay; have the DSKY.
140:17:01 Conrad: I understand I was Go.
140:17:13 Gordon: Houston, are you ready for our gyro torquing angles?
140:17:19 Carr: Clipper, Houston. Roger. Go ahead. [Long pause.]
140:17:45 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. I have a LM ascent PAD and a CSI PAD.
140:17:54 Conrad: Okay. Just a second. Are you ready for my - the rest of my hot fire?
140:17:58 Carr: Roger. We're ready. Go ahead. Break. Clipper, you can go ahead and torque.
140:18:05 Gordon: Okay, I did. Thank you.

140:19:08 Conrad: Okay. I gave you an extra pitchup fire because we were photographing the effects on the ground. It's quite spectacular.
140:19:16 Carr: Roger, Pete.
140:19:20 Bean: And we're ready to copy the launch PAD.
140:19:25 Carr: Roger. LM ascent PAD follows: TIG 142:03:47.00; Noun 76, 5535.0, 0037.0, plus 000.2; DEDA 47 is plus 37364, plus 05607, plus 58642, plus 56955; DEDA 465 is plus 00370; DEDA 546 is NA; ignition one Rev late is 144:02:09; LM weight, 10789; CSM weight, 35390. Over.

140:23:05 Carr: Affirmative, Al.
140:23:14 Conrad: Okay, Houston. I'm standing by for your up-data link and the LGC gyro compensation.
140:23:23 Carr: Roger, Pete.
140:23:31 Gordon: Houston, this is Clipper. I copied those Pads.
140:23:35 Carr: Roger, Clipper. [Long pause.]
140:23:51 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. Over.
140:23:57 Gordon: Go ahead.
140:23:59 Carr: Roger, Dick. You can terminate your battery Bravo charge now, and we'd like to have you put your O2 tank 1 heaters and your hydrogen tank 2 heaters back to Auto. And dump your waste water to between 5...
140:24:15 Gordon: Roger Roger. [Long pause.]
140:24:48 Carr: Yankee Clipper. Houston.
140:24:54 Gordon: I have - got the H2 and O2 heaters, and dump the water to 52 percent.
140:25:01 Carr: Okay. That's it, Dick. Thank you.
140:25:03 Gordon: And I'll do a purge next.
140:25:05 Carr: Roger.
140:25:06 Gordon: I'll do a purge on the oxygen and hydrogen fuel cell.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control Houston. We are about 5 minutes away now from Loss Of Signal with Yankee Clipper. Next time around, Yankee Clipper will be on his 30th revolution and Intrepid will lift-off on the 30th revolution. We're at 140 hours, 26 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 12.
In the ascent maneuver pad data pass up to Intrepid, which Al Bean copied, a lift-off time was given of 142 hours, 3 minutes, 47 seconds.

140:27:24 Carr: Pete, we'll be setting your gyro compensation uplink to you after you've done your second P57.
140:27:34 Conrad: Okay, must be a mistake in the checklist.
140:27:36 Carr: Yes, that's right. It's not - it's poorly placed in the checklist.
140:27:42 Conrad: Okay. How'd the hot fire look all the way around? Everything okay?
PAD data shows a horizontal velocity for Intrepid of 5,535 feet per second. We're at 140 hours and 28 minutes now into the flight.
140:28:08 Conrad: Got another question for you, too, Houston. What did Yankee Clipper's orbit finally decay down to? How well did you hit 60?
140:28:25 Carr: Roger, Pete. It's 61.9 by 58.4 at CDH. [Long pause.]
140:29:33 Conrad: Yes, that's pretty good, and we're targeted for zero CDH here on this thing, right?
140:29:42 Carr: That's affirmative.
140:29:47 Conrad: Okay. [Long pause.]
CDH standing for Constant Delta Height. It's the second maneuver in the rendezvous sequence. Given a normal or nominal situation it could very well turn out to be zero. It's designed to fine tune the orbit and with the numbers we're looking at it might very well turn out not to be necessary.
140:30:30 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. We're about 35 seconds from LOS. You're looking good, and we're looking for an AOS at 141:17.
140:30:42 Gordon: Okay, Jerry. Thank you.
Long comm break.

This is Apollo Control, Houston at 140 hours, 46 minutes now in the flight. We're 1 hour and 17 minutes away from Time Of Ignition, away from Intrepid's lunar lift-off from the Ocean of Storms. Intrepid will ignite running almost 5,000 pounds of propellant through the upper stage ascent engine. Ignition will occur with Yankee Clipper passing just overhead about 80 nautical miles ahead of Intrepid. Intrepid goes through a short vertical rise and pitches over to climb to altitude horizontally inserting into orbit with a velocity of nearly 6,000 feet per second at an altitude of some 60,000 feet. It's been a period of quite between Capcom Jerry Carr and Intrepid. We've been watching data on the displays at - the crew aboard Intrepid has completed loading their abort guidance system ascent targeting data. We're at 140 hours, 48 minutes now into the flight, and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control Houston now 140 hours, 52 minutes into the flight. We are still looking at a lift-off time of 142 hours, 03 minutes, 47 seconds. This ascent from the lunar surface is designed to put Intrepid in an initial orbit of 46.3 nautical miles by 8.8 nautical miles. For the burn we're looking for a Delta-V of 6,057 feet per second. The first maneuver following ascent, the concentric sequence initiate, is scheduled at 143 hours, 1 minute, 50 seconds with a Delta-V of 49.2 feet per second. The burn is scheduled to be done at apolune following lift-off and has the affect of raising the perilune. We're 1 hour, 10 minutes away now from scheduled Time Of Ignition. This is Apollo Control Houston.

141:00:14 Conrad: Any objections to us starting P57 now?
141:00:31 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. We prefer that you wait until 45 in order to maximize the Delta-T there.
141:00:39 Conrad: You mean 15, I hope.
141:00:46 Carr: Yes. That's right - 15. We were thinking in terms of lift-off minus 45.
141:00:58 Conrad: I'm with you.

141:02:47 Bean: Okay. I noticed that; we'll do it.
141:02:49 Carr: Okay. [Long pause.]
141:03:02 Conrad: That's exactly what it did prior to descent - not much.
AOS Rev 30 141:17:20.
This is Apollo Control at Houston at 141 hours, 9 minutes into the flight. We are 55 minutes away from ignition at this time. And some 8 minutes away from reacquiring the Command Module Yankee Clipper. In the Mission Control Center, a period of relatively quiet preparation, no large contention of persons have arrived yet into the viewing room, however in the control center proper certain key NASA management officials as well as fellow astronauts have arrived on the scene. Rocco Petrone, Apollo Director of the Apollo Program, as is George Low, Chris Kraft, Director of Flight Operations for the Manned Spacecraft Center, Jim McDivitt, Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program at MSC, Jim Lovell, the Commander for Apollo 13, Al Worden is here; Donald K. Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations, and Tom Stafford, Chief of the Astronaut Office. We are at 141 hours, 10 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 141 hours, 16 minutes now into the flight. We're less than a minute away now from reacquiring the Command Module, Yankee Clipper, now on its thirtieth revolution.
141:17:48 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. How do you read?
141:17:53 Conrad: Loud and clear. We're standing by...
141:17:54 Gordon: Clipper, read you loud and clear.
141:18:08 Gordon: Houston, Yankee Clipper. Read you loud and clear.
141:18:11 Carr: Roger, Clipper. Reading you the same.
141:18:16 Gordon: Okay. Looks Go here, Jer.
141:18:22 Carr: Roger, Dick. [Long pause.]
141:18:45 Carr: Clipper, Houston. Your state vectors are all good, so there'll be no uplink to you this time. Your map update PAD is scratched, and I've got a landmark tracking PAD if you're ready to copy?
141:19:01 Gordon: Roger. Do you want us to do this one, or can we skip it?
141:19:09 Carr: Stand by. [Pause.]
141:19:22 Gordon: The reason I say that, Jerry; since I can't see them at these high Sun angles, it's pretty academic to do this one. I'd just as soon save the gas and skip it.

141:19:35 Carr: Roger, Dick. We're talking about it.
141:20:02 Carr: Clipper, Houston. The data is only in the event you want to try to watch lift-off.
141:20:10 Gordon: Yes. I know that. I don't think I can see them, Jerry, so let's skip it. The sun angle's too high.
141:20:15 Carr: Okay, Dick.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston. You heard that exchange between Dick Gordon and Capsule Communicator Jerry Carr. What the discussion evolved about, Dick Gordon, aboard the Yankee Clipper, had the option of tracking Intrepid with his sextant on lift-off. As you heard, he indicated that the sun angle appeared too high to acquiring a sighting so that will probably be deleted from the actual Flight Plan. We're at 141 hours, 21 hours into the flight, 42 and a half minutes away from Time Of Ignition, and this is Apollo Control Houston.

141:21:30 Carr: Intrepid. Houston. Your gravity angle difference looks good and, there'll be no uplinks to you this time.
141:21:39 Conrad: Very good, very good.
141:21:43 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston.
141:21:48 Gordon: Go ahead.
141:21:49 Carr: Roger, Dick. Here's the Comm plan. About the time - When you get VHF communications established with Intrepid, we're going to dump the MSFN relay. If for some reason you lose it and you want to - you want to hear the - the Intrepid lift-off, let us know, and we can reconfigure in about 20 seconds; but we would prefer to leave the relay out as long az you've got VHF.
141:22:16 Gordon: Roger. I think that'll be fine. Thank you. [Long pause.]
141:22:36 Conrad: Boy, this place is fascinating, absolutely fascinating.
Long comm break.
That was Al Bean aboard the Intrepid. We're at 141 hours, 23 minutes now into the flight.
This is Apollo Control Houston 141 hours, 30 minutes now into the flight. Conrad and Bean are now going through the final phases of verifying navigational alignments. You heard that car up from Jerry Carr committing the torquing angles onboard as they are going through Program 57, lunar alignment. At this time, Flight Director Pete Frank is checking status, pulsing all of his flight control team as to our status Go or No-Go, and we're standing by.
141:29:35 Carr: Pretty nice looking torquing angles, Intrepid.

141:31:08 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. You're Go to East off on this Rev.
This is Apollo Control Houston, You heard that call from Jerry Carr giving them a Go for lift-off this Rev. At T minus 10 seconds, one of the two, probably Conrad, pushes the abort stage button and the 2 stages, although still mates are no longer mechanically secured to each other. The ascent engine is armed at minus 5 seconds. Conrad pushes a Proceed button on his computer display telling it to continue on in program 12 for lift-off. At T zero he pushes the Engine Start after verifying that the engine is indeed On. We're at 32 minutes now away from ignition, and this is Apollo Control Houston.
141:31:14 Conrad: Roger - Roger.
141:32:53 Bean: Houston, did you copy the values [garble]?
141:32:58 Carr: That's affirmative, Al, and they're Go.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 141 hours, 42 minutes now into the flight. We're 22 minutes away from Time Of Ignition. After ignition, Conrad confirms that the LM is stable and the altitude is increasing. Visual cues are prime for the first fifteen seconds. After pitchover is completed, the crew will be able to make their first solid checks on the primary guidance and navigation systems' performance. At lift-off plus 4 minutes, Conrad yaws Intrepid 20 degrees right to insure a continuing S-band lock. When time from ignition reaches approximately 6 minutes, 15 seconds, the onboard displays are changed from a velocity and altitude numbers to velocity to be gained. You'll probably hear Al Bean calling out some of these numbers. Engine shutdown monitoring is performed onboard simply by observing the velocity to be gained displayed. We're at 21 minutes now away from Time Of Ignition.
141:42:48 Conrad: Houston, we're firing ascent 1.

142:10:51 Carr: Looking good at 7, Pete.
142:10:52 Conrad: ...Get the Bus Feed on.
142:10:53 Bean: Okay.
142:10:54 Conrad: It just opened.
142:10:55 Bean: Okay.
142:10:56 Conrad: Seven.
142:10:57 Bean: Okay.
142:10:58 Conrad: Pushing Abort Stage.
142:11:00 Bean: Engine Arm, Off. Okay.
142:11:03 Conrad: Okay. Hey, I got to back off 32 feet [garble] thing. Agree to that, Houston? Master Alarm, but I don't know for what.
We've had shutdown.
142:11:24 Bean: Everything looks okay.
142:11:36 Bean: [Garble] Houston [garble].
142:11:39 Conrad: I'll tell you what happened. I got to watching that problem, and I let her overspeed.
142:11:43 Bean: Oh! Okay.
142:11:44 Conrad: Okay.
142:11:45 Bean: But didn't...
142:11:46 Conrad: [Garble] stage ready. I just figured we [garble].
142:11:47 Bean: Okay.
142:11:48 Conrad: Houston, how do you read?
142:11:50 Carr: Loud and clear, Pete.
142:11:54 Conrad: Okay. Does that look satisfactory to you?
142:11:57 Carr: Looks good, Pete. We copied your overburn, and we see you're turning now.
142:12:04 Conrad: Okay. I took it all out. I've got interested in this...
142:12:08 Gordon: Hello, Houston; Clipper. Still no VHF from Intrepid.
142:12:11 Conrad: Main shutoff valve A indicated barber pole.
142:12:16 Carr: Roger, Clipper.
142:12:17 Conrad: So I tried and recycled it twice and then shut off both ascent feeds and left the crossfeed open as it is now. And I'm going to close both of them.
142:12:25 Bean: Okay. Mode Control, two, up to Att Hold. They are.
142:12:29 Conrad: Okay.
142:12:31 Bean: Inverter 2, Inverter 1, Open.
142:12:32 Conrad: Okay.
142:12:33 Bean: And - on Inverter 2? I am on Inverter 2.
142:12:42 Conrad: Okay.
142:12:43 Carr: Intrepid, this is Houston. Punch your Engine Stop pushbutton.
142:12:50 Bean: Yes. Did it. Sorry about that. Everything's off.
142:12:55 Conrad: Okay.
142:12:57 Conrad: Okay. Now...
142:12:58 Conrad: External light to Track.
142:12:59 Bean: [Garble] let me get [garble] Gee, it's a dirty spacecraft in here.
142:13:03 Conrad: Shall we go off Vox?
142:13:04 Bean: Yes.
All 3 data sources show Go.
142:13:13 Carr: Clipper, Houston. We're setting up the relay now.
142:13:19 Gordon: I wonder why he's not transmitting VHF.[Pause.]
You heard that report. There was a little bit of an overburn; it trimmed out very nicely, however. We're at 1.
142:13:37 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Clipper's not reading you VHF; we're configuring for MSFN relay now.[Long pause.]
142:14:29 Carr: Intrepid; Yankee Clipper, how do you read Houston, now? We're in the Relay mode.
142:14:38 Conrad: Hello, Yankee Clipper; Intrepid. How do you read?
142:14:42 Gordon: Intrepid, Yankee Clipper. Loud and clear now.
142:14:50 Carr: Intrepid, did you read Clipper's answer?
142:14:56 Conrad: Yes, I read him.
Comm break.
Preliminary numbers would show an orbit of 47 nautical miles by 9 nautical miles. Very close to nominal. We're at 142 hours, 16 minutes now into the flight.
142:16:14 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Looks like you got a 47 by 8.8. Over.
142:16:23 Conrad: Roger. What were we targeted for?
142:16:44 Carr: Clipper, Houston. Give us P00 and Accept. We have a LM state vector for you.
142:16:55 Gordon: Okay, Houston. You got it.
142:16:57 Carr: Roger. On the way.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 142 hours, 18 minutes now into the flight. A preliminary look at the burn status would indicate an overburn of some 1½ seconds, which was trimmed out by Commander Pete Conrad as he was removing his residuals from the burn. We're at 142 hours, 18 minutes and this is Apollo Control Houston.
142:19:09 Carr: Intrepid, Houston.
142:19:15 Conrad: Go ahead.
142:19:16 Carr: Roger, Pete. Would you verify you're up on your forward VHF antenna? Break, Clipper, your computer's yours.
142:19:25 Conrad: We're up on VHF antenna.
142:19:26 Gordon: Thank you.
142:19:28 Carr: Roger, Pete.
Comm break.
Apollo Control Houston. We presently show the Lunar Module, Intrepid, in an orbit of 47.1 nautical miles by 8.7 nautical miles with a velocity of 5,504 feet per second. Intrepid once again in Lunar Orbit, once again a space faring vessel. Intrepid has now set sail for rendezvous. We're at 142 hours, 21 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control Houston.
142:21:42 Gordon: Houston, Clipper. Did you see the DSKY?
142:21:45 Carr: We got it, Dick. Go ahead.
142:21:50 Gordon: Roger. I've got some good torquing angles here. I guess you really don't need them, do you?
142:21:58 Carr: Negative. We don't need them.
142:21:59 Conrad: Can you read us?
142:22:02 Gordon: That's affirm. I read you now, Pete, loud and clear.
142:22:06 Conrad: Okay. You be looking. [Long pause.]
142:22:55 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston.
142:23:06 Conrad: Okay, Houston. You're looking at the DSKY there, the torquing angles.
142:23:14 Carr: Roger. We're looking at them, Pete. Sterling.
142:23:20 Conrad: Okay. Okay. We're going to Pro.
142:23:25 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. Over.
142:23:30 Gordon: Go ahead.
142:23:31 Carr: Roger, Dick. How about turning down your S-band thumbwheel and make a VHF check. And, if you're in good shape on VHF, we're going to break down this relay again.
142:23:42 Gordon: He's breaking now, Jerry; I can hear them now.
142:23:45 Carr: Roger.
142:23:52 Gordon: Are you supposed to be on Ranging right now? I thought you were supposed to be transmitting on A.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 142 hours, 25 minutes into the flight. The Mission Control Center does plan to pass up an update pad for Concentric Sequence Initiate the first maneuver and rendezvous, prior to LOS. We presently show 4 minutes and 30 seconds before LOS on the Command Module, Yankee Clipper and 5 minutes, 40 seconds on the Lunar Module.
142:25:10 Gordon: Intrepid, Clipper. I have you in my big eye.
142:25:26 Conrad: Very good.

142:26:17 Conrad: Dick, I hold you at 351 feet a second, at 200 miles.
142:26:35 Gordon: I concur on that, Pete.
142:26:39 Conrad: Say again, Dick.
142:26:40 Gordon: I concur. I concur.
142:26:42 Conrad: Okay. I'm just starting P20.
Comm break.
That was Pete Conrad reporting to Dick Gordon the range and range rate readings he had on his onboard display. In Mission Control Center, Houston, we are presently reading a range of 198 nautical miles, between the 2 spacecraft, and a range rate of minus 331 feet per second. We are now at 142 hours, 28 minutes into the flight.

142:28:31 Bean: Houston, Intrepid. We're going to go over to Omni now.
142:28:37 Carr: Roger, Intrepid.
142:28:47 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. You're about 45 seconds from LOS.
142:28:59 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. We'll see you at 143:16.
142:29:08 Conrad: Roger - Roger. [Long pause.]
142:29:20 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Your CSI Delta-V is going to be about 46.5. Over.
142:29:30 Conrad: Roger. 46.5. [Long pause.]
Apollo Control Houston. That was Jerry Carr passing up the Delta V for the first rendezvous maneuver. That was 46.5 feet per second. We managed to get it up in the nick of time just prior to Intrepid making its backside pass around the moon.
142:30:03 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. We've got LOS on the Clipper, and we'll see him at 13.
142:30:12 Conrad: Okay. Say again our AOS time?
142:30:17 Carr: Your AOS time is 143:16. It's nominal.
142:30:25 Conrad: 143:16. I got you.
142:30:26 Carr: Roger. Nominal in the flight plan.
142:30:35 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Go Low Bit Rate.
LOS Rev 30 CSM 142:26.
LOS Rev 30 LM 142:27.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 142 hours, 31 minutes. We have had LOS with both spacecraft. Both Intrepid and Yankee Clipper, passing by the backside of the Moon.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 142 hours, 38 minutes now to the flight of Apollo 12. Both Intrepid and Yankee Clipper passing above the far side of the moon out of acquisition range with Mission Control Center, Houston. Ground solution continues to show a forecast Time Of Ignition for the Concentric Sequence Initiate maneuver of 143 hours, 1 minute, 51 seconds. You heard the Delta-V for this maneuver passed to Intrepid just prior to going out of acquisition. That Delta-V, 46.5 feet per second. We're at 142 hours and 39 minutes now into the flight, and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 143 hours, 14 minutes now into the flight. We're less than 2 minutes away now from reacquiring Yankee Clipper as it emerges from around the far side of the moon. A report from our Science Staff Support Room indicates that the magnetometer and seismometers both had readings from Intrepid at lift-off. Presently, ground based solutions in the Control Center indicate that a Constant Delta Height at burn of some small magnitude may be accomplished or done on this front side pass. We won't know, of course, until we reacquire Intrepid and get their CSI solution. Ground computations would indicate a burn, a Constant Delta Height burn at 143 hours, 59 minutes, 53 seconds with a Delta-V of perhaps 12 to 14 feet per second. This would be done to fine tune or smooth out the wrinkles in the orbits of the two spacecraft. Intrepid traveling some 15 nautical miles below playing catch up. While Intrepid is playing catch up with Yankee Clipper the individual tasks for Conrad and Bean are probably divided along these lines. Conrad operating the radar and the DSKY during thrusting programs and making automatic or manual attitude changes. Bean logging all maneuver solutions and systems performance and operating the DSKY except when keyboard entries affect control of the spacecraft after thrusting. We have acquisition with Yankee Clipper. No conversation taking place at this time, however. We'll stand by at 143 hours, 16 minutes. We're 2 minutes, 25 seconds away of reacquiring Intrepid.

143:16:57 Gordon: Okay. Sounds good. I'll be working on out-of-plane here for you.
143:17:01 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. How do you read?
143:17:07 Gordon: Hello, Houston, Clipper. Loud and clear.
143:17:09 Carr: Roger.
143:17:15 Gordon: Roger. CSI burn was good. Intrepid burned 45.3 feet per second. My solution was 45.9.
143:17:28 Carr: Roger, Dick.
That was Dick Gordon reporting the Concentric Sequence Initiate burn was good. We're at 143 hours, 18 minutes. When we reacquire Intrepid we'll probably receive a status report on that burn. This is Apollo Control, Houston continuing to monitor.
143:18:38 Gordon: Hey, Pete, your plane change is minus 0.4. [Long pause.]
Now processing data on Intrepid, the Lunar Module.

143:19:32 Bean: Loud and clear, Houston.
143:19:34 Carr: Roger, Al. Read you the same.
143:19:41 Bean: Residuals PGNS were plus 0.1, minus 0.1, and minus 0.3.
143:19:54 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. We'd like to know what your Delta-Vs were that you loaded.
143:20:03 Conrad: What do you mean, what Delta-Vs we loaded? We loaded 45.3 feet per second. Is that what you mean?
143:20:09 Carr: Affirm.
143:20:10 Conrad: That was our CSI solution.
143:20:12 Carr: Okay.
143:20:14 Conrad: Okay. And I've run CDH here, and it looks like minus 9 and minus 8 roughly. Shows me 59 seconds early at TPI.
143:20:28 Carr: Roger.
143:20:30 Conrad: And we're not going to make the system look like we need to make the out-of-plane. We are down in the noise level on out-of-plane. Dick's going 0.4 of a foot per second; and I haven't looked at it yet, but I will in a minute.
143:20:44 Carr: Roger. Intrepid, Houston. Can you give us High Bit Rate, please? [Long pause.]
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 143 hours, 21 minutes now into the flight. We presently show Intrepid and Yankee Clipper at a range of 310 nautical miles with a range rate of minus 75 feet per second.
143:21:40 Conrad: I tell you, Houston, I sure do enjoy flying this thing. It's - Both the ascent stage and the descent stage are both nice.
143:21:51 Carr: Roger, Pete.
143:22:01 Conrad: For - for your information, I crossed that on the CSI burn, and that pretty evened me up, and I also switched my DAP load to system A.
143:22:19 Carr: Roger. Copy.
143:22:27 Conrad: And my out-of-plane shows 0.31 miles and 0.3 of a foot per second, so I think we'll forget it.
143:22:37 Carr: Okay, Pete. That sounds good. While you got a minute, we had a question about the sequence camera. Did that camera stop right after lift-off?.
143:22:51 Conrad: Apparently it did, and then it stopped again several times.
143:22:55 Bean: That's affirmative. It stopped, and then I started it, and it stopped two or three times.
143:23:00 Carr: Roger. [Long pause.]
143:23:49 Conrad: Say, I guess nobody else has - Anybody else had to use these window heaters before? Our windows keep fogging over, and I have to run the window heaters all the time.
143:24:05 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. The folks here say that was pretty nominal on Apollo 11.
143:24:13 Conrad: Oh, I didn't remember that. Okay. Very good.
143:24:43 Gordon: Hey, Pete.
143:24:45 Conrad: Go ahead, Dick.
143:24:46 Gordon: My CDH time on my computer is 143:59:46:70.47.
143:24:56 Conrad: Okay. We're within a couple - about 15 seconds of one another.
143:25:01 Gordon: Okay. We're going to use yours.
143:25:03 Conrad: Okay. 144:00:01.53.
143:25:10 Gordon: I got it. Thank you.
143:25:14 Carr: Intrepid, Houston.
143:25:18 Conrad: Go.
143:25:19 Carr: Roger, Pete. I sent you bum dope. 11 did not use their heaters.
143:25:26 Conrad: Yes. I don't remember anybody having to use them, and both my docking window and - and both Al's window and my window - We collected moisture on the lunar surface and we've started collecting it here in flight, so I put the window heater back on.
143:25:43 Carr: Roger.
Comm break.
Just prior to this call up from Mission Control you heard Pete Conrad and Dick Gordon comparing onboard computation numbers for CDH, the constant Delta Height maneuver. We're at 143 hours, 26 minutes now into the flight; and this is Apollo Control Houston.
143:26:43 Conrad: Sure do apologize, Houston, for the overburn. I got my head looking at Al there and I just shut her off late.
143:26:52 Carr: Roger. No sweat, Pete. [Pause.]
143:27:07 Gordon: What did he do this time, Pete?
143:27:08 Conrad: Say again.
143:27:10 Gordon: What the devil did he do this time?
143:27:12 Conrad: Well, he didn't do anything. We had one main shut-off valve that barber poled over here, and it turned out to be an indicator. But, I got interested in that and I didn't de-arm the engine soon enough, and we shut down about 30 feet per second over. That's the reason I had to back her up. No big deal. [Pause.]
We presently show Intrepid and Yankee Clipper 126 nautical miles apart. We're at 143 hours, 28 minutes now into the flight.
143:28:02 Gordon: Okay, Pete. My first try at it is [garble].
143:28:11 Conrad: And what?
143:28:18 Gordon: [Garble].
143:28:19 Conrad: Okay, Dick. You're almost unreadable.
143:28:22 Carr: Clipper, Houston. Your S-band is getting pretty ratty.
Comm break.
143:29:56 Conrad: Okay, Dick. I'm showing on 17.6.
143:30:17 Conrad: Are you looking at the recycle on the DSKY, Houston?
143:30:31 Carr: We're checking, Pete.
143:30:41 Conrad: It's minus 10 and minus 8.8.
143:30:45 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. We're watching. [Long pause.]
143:31:45 Conrad: I finally - finally have a visual on Yankee Clipper, I think.
143:31:52 Carr: Roger.
143:31:55 Conrad: Yes. I got you visually, Yankee.
143:32:08 Gordon: I'm still leading by 122 miles.
143:32:10 Conrad: Okay. I show 122 on mine, closing at 95 feet a second.
143:33:45 Conrad: [Garble] That Omni PPI [garble] Hey, I saw your flash down there [garble].
That was Pete Conrad reporting he thought he had a visual sighting of Yankee Clipper. The two spacecrafts presently 122 nautical miles apart. We are at 143 hours, 32 minutes into the flight.
See LM DSEA and M D tapes, comm is very ratty.
143:36:36 Gordon: Pretty close to that rim.
143:36:54 Conrad: [Garble] on the Surveyor on the [garble] of that crater.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 143 hours, 37 minutes now into the flight.
143:37:14 Conrad: Say, Houston, Al's working so hard keeping his AGS updated here, why don't we let him burn CDH?
143:37:26 Carr: Roger, Pete.
143:37:32 Conrad: Say again Jerry?
143:37:42 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Stand by on that. We're consulting our oracle right now.
143:37:48 Conrad: [Laughter] Houston, I'm only kidding, but he's all over the cockpit. Putting that range and range rate in.
143:37:57 Bean: [Garble] my burn.
see LM DSEA.
143:38:58 Conrad: I think we ought to rename the Intrepid the flying junk pile. You ought to see it inside this spacecraft, Houston.
143:39:09 Carr: Roger. Copy.
Comm break.
That was Pete Conrad coming to Mission Control with the suggestion that they do their CDH or Constant Delta Height maneuver, utilizing the AGS or the secondary guidance system. The point he made was that Al Bean was all over the cabin constantly updating their AGS numbers from the PNGS and I guess he thought why not use them. Presently we're showing Intrepid and Yankee Clipper 115 nautical miles apart. This through our displays, taking an over the shoulders look at Intrepid's computer readouts. We're at 143 hours, 39 minutes.
143:41:41 Conrad: Okay. I'm minus 10.3. And my TPI's 2½ minutes early.
143:41:58 Bean: Okay.
see LM DSEA.
Comm break.
143:43:08 Conrad: Say, Houston. With - with your concurrence - we'd like to go over into the cabin mode for a while, stay suited though, but in cabin mode and try to get rid of some of this dirt before we dock.
143:43:28 Carr: Roger, Pete. Stand by.
143:43:34 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Go ahead, use the cabin mode.
143:43:40 Conrad: [Garble] canisters. Yes. Okay.
143:43:41 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. I've a PIPA bias update read-up for you.
143:43:52 Bean: Okay.
143:43:59 Conrad: Go ahead.
143:44:00 Carr: Okay. Verb 21, Noun 01, Enter, 1452, Enter, 77423, Enter; Enter, 1454, Enter, 00406, Enter; Enter, 1456, Enter, 00777, Enter. Over.
143:44:52 Conrad: Okay. Let me see if I got those numbers all right. Verb 21, Noun 01, Enter, 1452, Enter, 77423, Enter; Enter, 1454, Enter, 00046, Enter, Enter, 1456, Enter, 00077?
143:45:14 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. That's negative. Address 1454 should read 00406, and address 1456 should read 00777. Over.
143:45:38 Conrad: Okay. 1454 is 00406 and 1456, 00777.
143:45:47 Carr: That's affirmative, Pete.
143:45:52 Conrad: Okay. [Long pause.]
143:46:26 Gordon: Hey, Al, have you ...?
143:46:32 Conrad: [garble] burn [garble].
143:46:35 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. Over.
143:46:41 Gordon: Go ahead, Houston.
143:46:42 Carr: Roger. I've got some High Gain angles for you, Dick.
143:46:55 Gordon: Go ahead [garble].
143:46:57 Carr: Roger. Pitch is minus 23 and yaw is plus 171. Over.
143:47:21 Gordon: And we're on High Gain.
143:47:23 Carr: Roger. [Long pause.]
143:47:54 Gordon: Pete, [garble] run your solution. I've only got 20 marks on [garble].
143:48:00 Conrad: Say again, Dick.
143:48:02 Gordon: [Garble] on that solution, we got enough marks here for five solutions. We ought to go ahead and press on.
143:48:14 Conrad: Okay. [Long pause.]
This is Apollo Control Houston. We currently show the 2 spacecraft at 103 nautical miles apart.
143:48:47 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. We're going to have...
143:48:49 Gordon: [Garble], Jer.
143:48:50 Carr: ...a handover here now, in your case from Honeysuckle to Madrid. Over. At143:50.
143:48:59 Gordon: Okay.
143:49:01 Conrad: Very good.
143:49:07 Gordon: Whichever way the world turns.
143:49:15 Gordon: Pete, your out-of-plane for CDH is 0.4 plus.
This is Apollo Control Houston. Meanwhile in the Control Center we have the ignition clock counting down for CDH. We show 10 minutes and 30 seconds until time of ignition. We're at 143 hours, 50 minutes now into the Flight of Apollo 12.
143:50:13 Gordon: Okay. I'm getting ready to [garble] final Comp.
143:50:17 Bean: I just fired one.[Long pause.]
143:50:33 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. How do you read through Madrid?
143:50:39 Gordon: Hello, Houston; Clipper. Loud and clear by me.
143:50:41 Carr: We read you the same.
Comm break.
143:51:42 Gordon: Early, early, early, it's a minus sign. Seventy-five. Okay. Here's my solution. Delta-H is 0.8; 34.53 at 3 minutes early; Delta-V's, Noun 81, 10.3, zero, and 7.0. 7.0. would you read me your velocities again please? 5.3 is in Y, [garble] in Z. Okay. I copied minus 2.2 zip, plus 9.3. How about minus 10.2 and 7, [garble] for this 9.3?
143:52:52 Conrad: Now, wait, wait, wait, Dick. Call Houston and have them relay it to me. I can't understand you.
143:53:00 Carr: Clipper, Houston. Go ahead.
143:53:03 Gordon: [garble] That's okay. Go ahead.
143:53:14 Gordon: Hey, Jerry. Just tell him I agree with his solution?
143:53:19 Carr: Roger. Break, Pete. Clipper says he agrees with your solution.
143:53:26 Conrad: Okay. Very good. And, Jerry, tell them that our Noun 81 was - Where did you put it, Al? Minus 10.7, or is that 2, minus 10.2 and minus 9.3?
143:53:43 Carr: Roger. Copy. Noun 81, minus 10.2, and minus 9.3.
143:53:51 Gordon: Roger - Roger.
143:53:52 Bean: That's affirmative.
143:53:56 Carr: And Clipper Rogered that. He heard it.
143:54:04 Conrad: Hey, you got any thoughts on the ground, Houston, why our Comm is so bad between each other?
143:54:11 Carr: Pete, we're checking.
143:54:12 Conrad: There must be something - Could you just tell us how to fix it?
143:54:13 Carr: Break. Did you get an out-of-plane from Dick?
143:54:18 Conrad: We don't have any out-of-plane. It was 0.3 again or something.
143:54:22 Gordon: That was 0.4, Pete.
143:54:24 Conrad: Oh; 0.4 of a foot per second.
Comm break.
143:55:43 Carr: Clipper, Houston.
143:55:49 Gordon: Go ahead, Houston; this is Clipper.
143:55:52 Carr: Roger. Just thought we'd better make a check with you and see how your antennas are. Are you on the starboard antenna?
143:56:02 Gordon: That's affirmative. I'm on the lower antenna, lower right.
143:56:05 Carr: Roger.
143:56:10 Gordon: The VHF is really horrible. [Long pause.]
143:57:06 Bean: Okay.
Comm break.
143:58:07 Bean: Okay.[Long pause.]
This is Apollo Control, Houston; the ignition clock in Mission Control shows now less than 3 minutes from Time Of Ignition for CDH, Constant Delta Height maneuver. Two minutes now away from CDH. This...
143:58:47 Gordon: Are you going to burn? [Long pause.]
143:59:10 Gordon: You're right, Al. I picked it up on the sextant. [Long pause.]
Less than a minute away now.
143:59:29 Gordon: It's smaller than the LM.
143:59:37 Gordon: I'm with you [Pause]. Let me know if I can help you. [Long pause.]
143:59:57 Gordon: Do you want a countdown? [Long pause.]
Flight Plan, page 3-124.
144:00:45 Bean: Okay, Pete.
Guidance says they are burning now.
144:00:50 Conrad: Burn complete, Houston.
144:00:52 Carr: Roger, Pete. Looks good.
Comm break.
Burn is concluded.
144:01:53 Conrad: Okay.
Comm break.
144:02:54 Bean: My TPI time was 144:34:54.87. That's pretty good.
144:03:03 Bean: 144:34:54.87.
144:03:43 Bean: Roger. 144:34:54.87.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 144 hours, 5 minutes now into the flight. We presently show Intrepid and Yankee Clipper some 80 nautical miles apart.
144:08:55 Conrad: Okay, Al. Pick up on [garble] right here. [Pause.]
144:09:17 Bean: Yes, sir.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston. We're at 144 hours, 10 minutes now into the flight. We presently show Intrepid and Yankee Clipper at 74 nautical miles apart with a closure rate of 141 feet per second.
144:10:51 Gordon: Okay. I got a time of 144:36:20.24. That's affirmative.
144:11:17 Gordon: 28.5 for TPI.
144:11:25 Gordon: It was 12 seconds off. [Long pause.]
144:11:52 Gordon: Ah, you're too easy. Still easy.
Comm break.
You've been listening to Intrepid and Yankee Clipper discussing their Terminal Phase Initiation solution.
The TPI, terminal phase initiation burn is one which effectively begins the intercept. It's done some - when the phasing between the two spacecraft is some 26 1/2 degrees from the local horizontal. We're at 144 hours, 13 minutes now into the flight. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
144:13:41 Gordon: You get your light on again?
144:13:52 Gordon: Hey, Pete?
144:13:57 Gordon: Okay. That blasted Sun cut there is making it very difficult to take marks. I got five of them; six of them so far.
144:14:14 Gordon: Good thing it doesn't bother the VHF any. I said it doesn't bother the VHF any.
144:15:13 Gordon: Okay.
144:15:24 Gordon: You guys got something flying along with you? Could be.
Comm break.
144:17:31 Gordon: Hey, would you guys check your tracking light? It's dark out there, I don't see you anymore. [Pause.]
144:17:56 Gordon: Well, I'll just keep looking here. Just hang on. [Long pause.]
144:18:37 Gordon: Well, I sure don't see you. [Long pause.]
144:18:51 Gordon: I wonder why you lost it. It was really great there the first night side pass.
144:19:11 Gordon: Well, you're gone, Pete. I'll have to back you up on VHF and seven marks. [Long pause.]
This is Apollo Control, Houston. We're at 144 hours and 20 minutes. Momentarily, CapCom Jerry Carr will pass along to the crew a ground - based solution of a - for TPI. CapCom Houston, we have a TPI solution here.
144:19:59 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. We have a TPI solution here.
144:20:06 Conrad: All right. We're ready to copy.
144:20:08 Carr: Okay. TIG at 144:35:52. We're getting a Delta-VX of 25.9; a Delta-VZ of minus 12.8. Your total Delta-V is 30.
144:20:29 Bean: Roger. That's very close. Our first cut was a V-total of 28.9.
144:20:36 Carr: Roger.
144:20:44 Gordon: Hey, Jerry, what happened to your out-of-plane solution?
This is Apollo Control, Houston. That TPI maneuver information is passed along for advisory purposes only. The crew, of course, does have the option of going with...
144:21:10 Carr: Clipper, Houston. We're seeing about 8 feet-per-second, but we don't believe it.
144:21:19 Gordon: Oh, okay.
144:21:20 Bean: We don't either.
144:21:22 Gordon: I knew you had to have something somewhere. Hey, you ought to see the Earth in the telescope, Pete; it's fantastic.
Intrepid, of course, has the option of going with the onboard solution. The TPI maneuver will be performed...
144:21:42 Gordon: But I don't have you in the sextant. That's okay. Your blinking light's just not blinking, that's all.
144:21:51 Conrad: Hey, Houston. It looks like our tracking light's burned out. Dick hasn't been able to find us in this sextant. And on the first night side pass we had little bits and pieces floating along with us and we could tell that the tracking light was flashing on them. And we still have, I've presumed to think, bits and pieces floating along and nothing's flashing on them, so I'm pretty sure it burned out.
144:22:11 Carr: Roger, Pete. [Long pause.]
TPI has performed over the backside of the moon or the far side pass."
144:22:22 Bean: Yes, sir. Okay.
144:22:26 Carr: Hi, Intrepid.
144:22:27 Bean: Okay.
144:22:28 Carr: This is Houston. How'd your sweep down fore and aft go?
144:22:33 Conrad: It's getting much cleaner in here running this way; and, also, Yankee Clipper informs me he has the television all set up. When we come around the horn, we'll come around with the television on in Vox.
144:22:47 Carr: Roger.
144:22:53 Conrad: Who knows, you may get to see the first whifferdill.
144:22:59 Carr: Roger, Pete. Our electrical watchers say that the current indicates that your tracking light is on.
144:23:11 Conrad: Okay. Now we just turned it off. Now does the current show that?
144:23:19 Carr: It - It sure does, Pete.
144:23:26 Gordon: You're - they're - You're flying through the air backwards, then, Pete, because I don't see it.
144:23:33 Conrad: Well, my ball tells me I'm pointed at you, Dick, and so does my radar.
144:23:38 Gordon: Well, you may have current, but you don't have any light.
144:23:43 Conrad: Maybe that thing can burn out in such a manner that it still draws current - But that doesn't make sense, does it?
144:23:49 Carr: That's affirmative, Pete.
144:23:55 Conrad: Oh, it can't do that?
144:24:00 Carr: Yes, it can.
144:24:03 Conrad: Well, I'm pretty sure it's burned out. I don't see it flashing anywhere in the spacecraft, not that I remember seeing it before, but I did remember it on bits and pieces, and I don't see it anymore.
144:24:29 Conrad: Yes. When's - when's LOS, Houston?
144:24:33 Carr: We've got LOS coming up for both of you in 3 minutes.
144:24:40 Conrad: Okay. Very good.
144:24:42 Carr: You're only about 10 seconds apart.
144:24:47 Conrad: Okay.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control Houston. 144 hours, 25 minutes. We presently show Intrepid and Yankee Clipper 53 nautical miles apart with a rate of closure of 136 feet per second. We've got some 2 minutes and roughly 2½ minutes before we have Loss Of Signal on both vehicles. We're at 144 hours, 26 minutes now into the flight and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
144:25:50 Gordon: Okay. I've got a recycle going.
144:27:02 Conrad: [Garble] Houston [garble].
144:27:10 Gordon: Okay, Pete. Thank you.
144:27:20 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. Go Low Bit Rate. Pass that word on to the LM.
144:27:30 Gordon: Will do, Jerry.
LOS Rev 31.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 144 hours, 28 minutes into the flight of Apollo 12. We've had Loss Of Signal with both Intrepid and the Yankee Clipper.
This is Apollo Control at 145 hours, 13 minutes now into the flight. We are some 1 minute and 20 seconds away at this time from reacquiring the Command Module Yankee Clipper. As the 2 spacecraft come around the far side of the moon, the Yankee Clipper will be configured for television to show the final phases of rendezvous and docking. Meanwhile, we have been furnished some numbers by the Houston television pool which indicate in addition to US networks the Atlantic and Indian Ocean satellites are covering a total of 32 countries with a potential audience of some 300 million persons. The Japanese news pool, also by satellite transmission has a potential of 100 million persons. Line coverage is being transmitted to the Philippine Islands, Hong Kong, Hawaii, Korea, Australia, and Taiwan. In addition to that, tapes are being flown to African and the Middle East with a potential viewer count of 6 million persons. We're 10 seconds away now from forecast time of acquisition and we'll stand by.
Flight Plan, page 3-125.
AOS Rev 32, 145:11
145:14:24 Bean: [Garble] S-band 500, 111. There it is.
145:14:31 Conrad: Find the S-band yet?
145:14:33 Bean: Yes.
145:14:34 Conrad: Where?
145:14:35 Bean: Where it's supposed to be.
145:14:37 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. How do you read?
145:14:42 Conrad: Houston, Intrepid reads you loud and clear. We're 1.7 miles away from Yankee Clipper, closing at 38 feet per second. Right down the tube.
145:14:55 Carr: Roger, Pete. Break. Yankee Clipper, Houston. How do you read?
145:15:00 Gordon: Hello, Houston; Yankee Clipper. Loud and clear. How me?
145:15:03 Carr: Roger. The same.
145:15:07 Gordon: What do you have on the tube?
145:15:10 Carr: Nothing yet, Dick.
145:15:17 Gordon: Okay. I'm going to roll a little more and give you some more High Gain.
145:15:34 Carr: Clipper, Houston...
145:15:37 Conrad: 38 feet per second.
145:15:40 Carr: Clipper, Houston. We're going to need about a 60-degree roll right to get to High Gain.
145:15:48 Gordon: You're getting it. [Long pause.]
Pete Conrad reporting a closure rate of 38 feet per second, about 1.7 nautical miles away. 145 hours, 16 minutes; standing by for any television transmission.
145:16:21 Gordon: Pete, I have you at 1.2 miles.
145:16:23 Conrad: I concur.
145:16:30 Gordon: Boy, you sure look strange down there among all the sand dunes.
145:16:35 Conrad: Sorry about that.
145:16:42 Gordon: One mile, and I'm [garble] at 31 feet.
One mile apart at a closure rate of 31 feet per second.
"One mile apart" - this is 1 Nautical mile (6,076 feet or 1,851.2 metres) - Comparing the POA with the LM Timeline book on page 14, it states at 6,000 feet (1,800 metres) they should be braking at 30 fps (9 ms).
145:16:58 Gordon: Okay, 1 mile, I got you at.
145:17:00 Conrad: Okay.[Long pause.]
Television signal just beginning to come in now. We're standing by.
145:17:21 Carr: Clipper, Houston. We're getting your TV black and white now. Processing will be along shortly.
145:17:30 Gordon: Okay. How does it look?
145:17:34 Carr: Looking good in black and white, and we think we can see Intrepid.
145:17:41 Conrad: 55 [he could be correcting himself here.] - 4,500 feet at 30 feet a second.
The above dialogue in the Technical Air-To-Ground voice transcripts is typed as 40,500 feet. Bryan Gurney correctly suggests this should be 4,500 feet (1,370 metres).
145:17:48 Carr: Roger.
145:17:51 Conrad: Hold off a little more. Looks close now.
145:17:56 Bean: Huh?
145:17:58 Conrad: Looks close now, and he's 4,000 feet away.
The above dialogue in the Technical Air-To-Ground voice transcripts is typed as 40,000 feet. Bryan Gurney correctly suggests this should be 4,000 feet (1,220 metres).
145:18:03 Gordon: [Garble] in case I have to break for you. Hey, Pete, you're looking pretty good. I've got you at 0.6 of a mile.
145:18:15 Conrad: Yes. Okay. About through a half a mile here, and going down. [Pause.]
145:18:29 Conrad: Better run through that secondary canister for a while. This primary doesn't smell too good, either. That's our [garble] Both in Secondary?
145:18:38 Conrad: All right. At half a mile; 19 feet a second, Dick.
Out about 3,000ft (900 metres)- again comparing with the LM Timeline book page 14, it states they should be closing at 20fps (6.09ms).
145:18:44 Gordon: Check. A half a mile.
145:18:51 Gordon: Now, you're looking pretty good.
145:18:55 Conrad: Okay. [Long pause.]
145:19:24 Conrad: You look pretty darn good yourself. Out at 2,000 feet.
145:19:30 Carr: Clipper, Houston. We've got good color now. Looking good.
145:19:37 Gordon: Okay, Pete, I've got you at one-third of a mile. 2,000.
145:19:43 Conrad: Okay.
145:19:45 Gordon: Looking good. How can you look so good if you're so ugly?
145:19:55 Conrad: Say again.
145:19:57 Gordon: How can you look so good when you're so ugly?
145:19:59 Conrad: I don't know, You look awful good yourself.
There you see Intrepid as it approaches.
145:20:10 Conrad: 1,500 feet, Dick.
145:20:11 Gordon: Okay.
145:20:13 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Give us High Bit Rate, please.
145:20:19 Conrad: Okay, Houston.
145:20:44 Conrad: Eight feet a second at 1,200 feet. Clipper, moves out there when you give her maximum thrust. [Pause.]
145:21:09 Conrad: Five feet a second.
145:21:12 Gordon: Okay, Pete, you're looking good. Keep it coming.
145:21:14 Conrad: Okay. Thousand feet.
145:21:26 Bean: Let her coast in.
145:21:28 Conrad: Antenna is in, now [garble].
145:21:32 Bean: Huh?
145:21:34 Conrad: I'm punching this antenna. Okay right now. [Long pause.]
Intrepid coasting in now. Dick Gordon, aboard the Yankee Clipper, will actually perform the docking.
145:22:01 Conrad: Exterior light off.
145:22:03 Gordon: It's off.
145:22:05 Conrad: Omni aft on the midleft.
145:22:08 Gordon: Omni aft [garble].
145:22:10 Gordon: [Garble] feet.
145:22:12 Conrad: Say again.
145:22:13 Gordon: I said 900 feet.
145:22:15 Conrad: Yes. I got 800.
145:22:17 Gordon: Okay. [Long pause.]
145:22:42 Conrad: You're looking better all the time, Yankee.
145:22:46 Gordon: Yes, keep going; I still have some film left. [Long pause.]
Pete Frank going around the room pulsing his flight control team as to status; we are looking good at this time.
145:23:44 Conrad: 500 feet.
145:23:49 Gordon: Check. I've got you at 540. [Long pause.]
145:24:19 Conrad: Okay, I'm down to 3 feet a second.
145:24:23 Gordon: Is your tracker light on?
145:24:26 Conrad: No. We'll turn it on for you.
145:24:31 Gordon: No, you don't have one.
Closure rate of 3 feet per second."
145:24:36 Bean: Okay. We'll turn it back off. [Long pause.]
145:25:08 Conrad: Two feet a second, Dick, 200 feet. [Long pause.]
200 feet apart now.
145:25:42 Conrad: Okay, the radar broke lock, Al; would you take care of it?
145:25:47 Bean: Okay.
145:25:48 Conrad: I'll go to the checklist.
145:25:50 Bean: Okey-dokey.
145:25:58 Conrad: How do you read me, Dick?
145:25:59 Gordon: I read you loud and clear, Pete; you look awful good. How come you didn't bring the docking target back with you?
145:26:10 Conrad: Say again.
145:26:12 Gordon: How come you didn't bring the docking target back with you?
145:26:15 Conrad: You're almost unreadable. Relay through Houston.
145:26:20 Carr: Roger, Intrepid. He wants to know why you didn't bring the docking target with you.
145:26:26 Conrad: Oh, I got it. On the top.
145:26:27 Bean: Pete?
145:26:30 Bean: Yes.
145:26:32 Bean: Want me to start right there?
145:26:33 Conrad: Yes, Verb 34, Enter.
145:26:34 Bean: Okay. Verb 34, Enter. [Long pause.]
145:26:51 Conrad: Let me put down that number. Might be a good one to remember.
145:26:56 Gordon: Hello, Houston; Clipper.
145:26:58 Carr: Clipper, Houston. Go. We can see thrusters firing now.
145:27:04 Gordon: Okay. Am I clear for Pyro Arm?
145:27:12 Carr: You're Go for Logic, Dick.
145:27:13 Gordon: And I'll have the T-6 [?] Logic on for you in a minute. Okay, here's the Logic.
145:27:29 Carr: Clipper, Houston. You're Go for Pyro Arm and stand by to receive the skipper's gig.
145:27:37 Gordon: Aye-aye, sir. Okay, Pete. Why don't you let me finish this roll, huh?
145:27:48 Conrad: Do your what?
145:27:49 Gordon: Let me finish this 180-degree roll. Okay?
145:27:55 Conrad: I don't understand what he's saying, Al; do you understand?
145:27:58 Bean: No.
145:27:59 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. he's going to finish his roll maneuver now.
145:28:02 Bean: I'm working on it.
145:28:05 Conrad: All right [garble] Two rolls, Dick, and I'll fly wing on you.
145:28:16 Gordon: Okay.
145:28:26 Conrad: Look at that S-band antenna of his [garble] track.
145:28:33 Bean: Is it moving?
145:28:37 Conrad: Also, that is extremely interesting. Look at the cover on the [garble].
145:28:44 Conrad: Huh?
145:28:47 Bean: Okay. Cover on what?
145:28:48 Bean: Look at the umbilical cover. Do you suppose that's where it got hit by lightning or something? What's made it brown? Look at the top of it; it's burned.
145:28:55 Bean: Yes, I do believe that's where it got hit.
145:28:58 Conrad: No. Maybe it gets burned by other...
145:29:03 Bean: Maybe we better find out. Why don't you move over to the left a little bit? And I'll take a picture of it, and they can look at it later.
145:29:10 Gordon: Hey. Can you drop down a little, Pete?
145:29:12 Conrad: Can I do what?
145:29:13 Gordon: Drop down.
145:29:15 Conrad: Down.
145:29:16 Gordon: Yes. Towards the Moon.
145:29:20 Conrad: Towards where?
145:29:21 Gordon: Toward the Moon.
145:29:25 Conrad: Oh, yes; okay.
145:29:27 Bean: Okay, Pete...
145:29:28 Conrad: How much farther down you want me to go?
145:29:30 Gordon: Well, go down so I can see you; I've lost -I'm losing you now.
145:29:36 Conrad: You don't have me?
145:29:38 Gordon: No. Get down towards the Moon; you're going below me, below the spacecraft.
145:29:43 Conrad: Oh, I think he wants me to...
145:29:45 Bean: That's right. He's upside down.
145:29:46 Conrad: Oh, I'm sorry, when you say down - that's up to me pal; I'm upside down.
145:29:50 Gordon: I said towards the Moon.
145:29:52 Conrad: Sorry, I don't know where the Moon is; I just...
145:29:53 Gordon: It's right there.
145:29:55 Conrad: Now, you see me?
145:29:56 Gordon: Okay. Go. I got you.
145:29:59 Bean: Okay.
145:30:01 Gordon: Now, do your maneuvering.
145:30:02 Conrad: All right, let me stop my radar - have you got it?
145:30:04 Gordon: I've got it.
145:30:05 Conrad: You've got it.
145:30:06 Bean: Okay, you need to pull both rendezvous circuit breakers.
145:30:08 Conrad: Okay, wait just a second. Is the rendezvous radar in the right place?
145:30:13 Gordon: It's 320, 320, which is where it should be.
145:30:16 Conrad: Okay. Got those out. Rendezvous radar breakers are pulled from the Verb 44.
145:30:21 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. If you get a chance, we would like that picture.
145:30:28 Conrad: He took it already, Houston.
145:30:30 Carr: Good show.
145:30:31 Conrad: Started 9 take it with the movie camera, but - hey, he's got something sticking out around the top of him too; you ought to take a look. Right up there.
145:30:40 Bean: On the top, Pete.
145:30:42 Conrad: Wait a minute; I [garble] on my checklist here.
145:30:45 Bean: All right.[Long pause.]
145:30:59 Bean: Hey, overhead window. Read me the rest of that, Al.
145:31:04 Bean: Okay. External lighting to Dock.
145:31:10 Conrad: Okay.
145:31:13 Bean: Which it is. And - that's it.
145:31:14 Conrad: Okay. Here I come...
145:31:15 Bean: No, wait. Why don't you take a look at what ever is swinging on top of the spacecraft; see it?
145:31:21 Conrad: It's probably part of the SEP package.
145:31:23 Bean: I bet it is. I bet you're right [garble] back to back.
145:31:26 Conrad: Get a picture of that?
145:31:28 Bean: I tried to.
145:31:31 Conrad: All right, Dick, I'm going to pitch over 90-degrees now.
145:31:34 Gordon: Okay, let's go.
145:31:35 Conrad: Okay, I'm going Omni aft, Houston.
145:31:39 Carr: Roger, Intrepid.
145:31:41 Conrad: Let me have this one [garble]. [Pause.]
145:31:56 Bean: My antenna's okay.
145:32:01 Conrad: Okay. Pitch down 90 and yaw...
145:32:18 Bean: You're right, Pete. Now look, [garble] right now.
145:32:25 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Give us Low Bit Rate.
145:32:31 Bean: Will do.
145:32:34 Conrad: Okay, Dick. Now, I'm going to yaw left 120.
145:32:38 Gordon: Okay. Go ahead; I'm ready.
145:32:39 Conrad: Okay.
145:32:46 Bean: [Garble]. [Pause.]
145:32:58 Conrad: Okay.
145:33:05 Conrad: Okay.
145:33:06 Bean: Pete [garble].
145:33:07 Conrad: 90.
145:33:17 Gordon: That's not enough. That's good.
145:33:21 Conrad: Okay.
145:33:22 Bean: Okay. There's another one for you.
145:33:24 Conrad: Okay. Verb 77.
145:33:26 Bean: I've got Verb 77, but I'll do it again.
145:33:30 Conrad: 0kay.
145:33:31 Bean: What else?
145:33:32 Conrad: [Garble] contact after hard dock. Mode Control both Off. After the hard dock.
145:33:36 Bean: Okay. Yes.
145:33:40 Conrad: [Garble] down there. [Long pause.]
Intrepid now station keeping with Yankee Clipper. We're at 145 hours, and 34 minutes.
145:34:23 Conrad: Hey, Richard. You didn't set up the rendezvous target for me.
145:34:29 Gordon: [Garble] your picture taken instead.
145:34:32 Conrad: Okay.
145:34:38 Gordon: Hey, we're looking good and closing. Right on the money.
145:34:44 Conrad: Okay. Looks good here.
145:34:47 Gordon: Okay.
145:34:55 Conrad: Looking good; looking good. That a boy! [Garble] up a little bit. Looks good, Dick.
145:35:22 Conrad: Got capture?
145:35:23 Gordon: Capture.
145:35:24 Conrad: Okay, go Free.
145:35:25 Gordon: Free.
145:35:27 Conrad: Very good. We're in good shape. Go ahead [garble].
145:35:32 Gordon: That's what there was supposed to be, wasn't I, was Free?
145:35:35 Conrad: Yes, sir, you're looking good. Stable as a rock. Go ahead.
145:35:37 Gordon: Wait a minute; just let me stabilize a little bit.
145:35:40 Conrad: Okay, it looks pretty stable to me.
145:35:42 Gordon: Think so, huh?
145:35:44 Conrad: Huh?
145:35:45 Gordon: I want to put you down just a little bit.
145:35:46 Conrad: Okay.
145:35:47 Gordon: Let the dynamics die out just a little.
145:35:49 Conrad: Okay. It's hardly moving at all.
145:35:53 Gordon: Yes, but the target, I want for you to come down a little bit.
145:35:57 Conrad: Okay. Steady as a rock.
145:36:00 Gordon: Okay, I'm getting it down there with the attitude. It's okay. Okay?
145:36:05 Conrad: Go ahead.
145:36:06 Gordon: Are you ready to retract?
145:36:07 Conrad: I'm ready to retract.
145:36:08 Gordon: Okay, Charlie Brown, here you go.
145:36:13 Conrad: Okay. [Pause.]
145:36:23 Gordon: And you're home free, boy.
145:36:24 Bean: [Garble] beautiful.
145:36:25 Conrad: Both drogue latches are out, pal, and you got it.
145:36:30 Gordon: Thank you, thank you.
145:36:31 Conrad: Super job, Richard. That was smooth, wasn't even a ripple. Okay, read me the checklist there, Al.
145:36:41 Bean: Okay. Mode Control, AGS at Hold.
145:36:45 Conrad: AGS at Hold.
145:36:47 Bean: Attitude Control, three of them pulled.
145:36:49 Conrad: Pulled.
145:36:50 Bean: Guidance and Control, AGS.
145:36:51 Conrad: Guidance and Control, AGS.
145:36:52 Bean: Deadband, Max.
145:36:54 Conrad: Deadband, Max.
145:36:55 Bean: Balance couples, On.
145:36:56 Conrad: Balance couples, On.
145:36:57 Bean: Verify Forward Dump valve, Auto.
145:37:00 Gordon: Hello, Houston; Clipper.
145:37:02 Carr: Clipper, Houston. Go.
145:37:05 Gordon: Roger, that's the end of the TV show. We've got some work to do.
145:37:10 Carr: Roger. We can see Pete through the window now.
145:37:15 Gordon: Well, I'll leave it on for a little while then.
145:37:17 Conrad: Hello, there.
145:37:20 Bean: I've got a 12021.
145:37:23 Carr: Roger, Pete. We can see your nose from here.
145:37:28 Conrad: That's my sunglasses I've got on in my helmet.
145:37:31 Bean: 12021.
145:37:35 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. I've got some S-band angles for you.
145:37:37 Conrad: The Marines are picking on us again.
145:37:42 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Negative on the angles.
145:37:45 Bean: Go ahead.
145:37:48 Conrad: Okay. Houston, I've got 5,838 in for the LM weight 35,389 in for the CSM weight. Is that good enough?
145:38:04 Carr: Stand by Pete.
145:38:11 Conrad: Those are blank on my checklist, so I'm...
145:38:19 Bean: I believe you're right. I believe lightning must have hit right on the front of that [garble].
145:38:23 Conrad: Well, I'm not sure that [garble].
145:38:24 Bean: [Garble] look around [garble].
145:38:32 Conrad: Where are you going to, Richard?
145:38:35 Gordon: I'm just wandering, Pete. I've got it in 10-degree Deadband plus or minus 5.
145:38:42 Conrad: Okay.
145:38:48 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. I got your weights.
145:38:54 Conrad: All right, Houston. Go ahead.
145:38:57 Carr: Okay, LM weight is 5,334, and CSM weight is 35,600.
145:39:10 Conrad: Copy. LM weight is 5,334, and CSM is 35,600. Very good. [Pause.]
145:39:25 Carr: Roger. Break. Clipper, did you copy?
145:39:32 Gordon: Houston, I just put 5,500 in for the LM. Is that close enough?
145:39:41 Carr: Clipper, the LM weight is 5,334; and if you're ready to copy, I've got your trims for you.
145:39:54 Gordon: Listen, I don't really need those things, do I?
145:39:57 Carr: Okay, we'll skip them.
145:40:01 Gordon: Hang on to them in case we need them, though, Jerry. I've got to get to work and get that tunnel pressurized.
145:40:07 Carr: Roger. Go half degree deadband.
145:40:13 Gordon: I'm in plus or minus 5-degrees. I can save some fuel that way.
145:40:37 Gordon: Houston, Clipper.
145:40:39 Carr: Clipper, Houston. Go.
145:40:43 Gordon: I expect the folks are a little bored with that scene now. I'll turn the television off with your concurrence.
145:40:49 Carr: Roger. We concur.
145:40:55 Gordon: How was the show?
145:40:57 Carr: Very, very good, Dick.
145:41:02 Gordon: Okay, the TV is off.
145:41:06 Carr: Clipper, Houston. You did a great job of docking.
145:41:12 Conrad: Boy, that was a super job.
145:41:15 Gordon: The way you guys stuck it out there in front of me, all I had to do was drive it in. [Long pause.]
This is Apollo Control Houston. The television transmission is now nill. We copied preliminary docking time of 145 hours, 36 minutes, and you heard Pete Conrad commend command module pilot Dick Gordon for what he described as a super job. We're at 145 hours, 42 minutes; and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
145:42:00 Carr: Intrepid, Houston, go Updata Link to Data. Your S-band antenna angles are pitch, 176; yaw, 59.
145:42:18 Bean: Thank you, Houston. We'll try it.
145:42:26 Gordon: Hey, Pete, is your Forward Dump in Auto?
145:42:29 Conrad: Yes.
145:42:30 Gordon: Okay.
145:42:32 Carr: Yankee Clipper mid Intrepid, we're ready to start uplinks to you. Who would like the first one?
145:42:42 Gordon: Yes, Clipper is ready.
145:42:45 Carr: Roger. Give us P00, and we'll start it up.
145:42:50 Gordon: It's all yours.
145:42:58 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. High Bit Rate. [Pause.]
145:43:16 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Give us High Bit Rate. Over.
145:43:22 Conrad: Roger, we'll give you High Bit Rate.
145:43:25 Bean: We gave it to you, Houston. Maybe you're just not catching it.
145:43:27 Carr: Roger. We copy now. [Long pause.]
145:46:44 Conrad: Say, Houston; Intrepid. What time is it back there, anyhow?
145:46:50 Carr: It's just about high noon. It's 9 minutes after 12.
145:46:56 Conrad: Oh, I - I've completely lost all sense of night and day. A1 said, A1 wants to know what day it is.
145:47:08 Carr: 20 November, 20; and it's Thursday.
145:47:13 Conrad: Okay. Thursday, Roger.
145:47:32 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. If you'll go P00 and Data, we've got an uplink for you, and go Updata Link to Data. Over.
145:47:43 Conrad: You got it, Houston.
145:47:48 Carr: Clipper, Houston. The computer's yours. [Long pause.]
145:48:20 Conrad: Say, Houston, while you got a minute, I'd like to talk over something with you.
145:48:27 Carr: Go ahead, Pete.
145:48:31 Conrad: When we were on the back side then coming around, I don't remember exactly what time it was, coming up on - what was it, midcourse correction - coming up on a midcourse correction, we got an ECS light with a partial pressure CO2 and went over seven. And that kind of surprised me, and we did switch the canister secondary, and sure enough the CO2 gage went to zero, and like it was starting on a fresh canister. I don't think the canister that we put in, which was at 130 hours, that's only 15 hours old, should have done that. I'm wondering if maybe I ought to take a look at that canister and see if it's wet or anything.
145:49:33 Carr: Roger, Pete. Stand by. I think we've got some words on that.
145:49:39 Conrad: Okay. [Long pause.]
145:49:51 Gordon: Hey, Pete, got to take the hatch out.
145:50:08 Conrad: Is that what you said, Dick? We can open the hatch?
Comm break.
145:52:49 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. The computer's yours.
145:52:55 Conrad: Roger.
145:53:05 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. Got a CSM separation maneuver PAD for you and a LM Jettison attitude and a LM Jett time.
145:53:18 Gordon: Houston, this is Clipper. You're going to have to hold those. I'm busy up here in the tunnel.
145:53:22 Carr: Okay. You'll just give me a call when you're ready for them.
145:53:26 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. I've got PAD for you when you're ready to copy.
145:53:28 Conrad: Might go over the hill. Hey, Jerry, don't let him go over the hill without getting them.
145:53:35 Carr: Okay.
145:54:03 Carr: Intrepid, Houston. You ready to copy Pads?
145:54:10 Bean: Negative, Houston. But we will be in just a minute; I'll give you a call.
145:54:13 Carr: Okay.
Comm break.
145:57:21 Gordon: Hey, Pete. Hey, Conrad. Hey, Commander Conrad. Pietro! where are you?
145:57:47 Bean: Yankee Clipper, Intrepid. Are you giving us a call?
145:57:48 Gordon: No, we're talking to each other. Sorry about that.
145:57:53 Bean: Okay.
145:57:58 Conrad: I've got my helmet on, Dick. I can't see you down here. [Long pause.]
145:58:20 Bean: Houston - Houston, Intrepid. We're ready to copy those Pads.
145:58:25 Carr: Roger, Intrepid. The first PAD will be a P30 LM maneuver; call it LM impact or LM final. Are you ready?
145:58:45 Bean: Ready to go.
145:58:47 Carr: Roger. Noun 33: 149:28:17.50; Noun 81: minus 0181.2, plus 0060.3, minus 0001.5; Noun 42 is NA; burn time, NA; FDAI: 162, 358; AGS: minus 0181.1, plus 0060.3, minus 0002.8. The rest is NA.
145:59:56 Bean: Roger, Houston. 149:28:17.50; minus 0181.2, plus 0060.3, minus 0001.5; NA; NA; NA; NA; 162, 358; minus 0181.1, plus 0060.3, minus 0002.8.
Flight Plan, page 3-126.
146:00:18 Carr: That's affirmative, Al. A couple of Flight Plan updates for you. Number l: we would like for you to bring back the sequence camera and stow it in Alfa 8 and no bag will be required. Over.
146:00:46 Bean: Understand.
146:00:49 Carr: Roger, Al. Also, on panel 16, would you pull your LM tracking light's circuit breaker? Over.
146:01:00 Bean: Way ahead of you on that one.
146:01:16 Gordon: Hello, Houston; Clipper.
146:01:17 Carr: Go ahead, Clipper.
146:01:21 Gordon: I'm ready for those Pads.
146:01:24 Carr: Roger, Dick. Would you put your Tape Recorder forward switch to Forward, please?
146:01:34 Gordon: Okay. It is.
146:01:36 Carr: Okay, the first one will be your separation burn PAD. Separation maneuver follows: roll, 180; pitch, 343; yaw, 000; GET of TIG is 148:04:30; Delta-V; 1 foot per second; burn, Z-axis, retrograde. Over.
146:02:26 Gordon: Roger. CSM separation attitude 180; pitch, 343; 000 in yaw; TIG, 148:04:30; Delta-V, 1 foot per second; Z-axis, Retro.
146:02:45 Carr: Roger. This is your Jettison PAD. Your roll angle is 220; pitch is 358; yaw is 352 - correction, 342; GET of Jettison is 147:59:S0. Over.
146:03:16 Gordon: Jettison altitude: roll, 220; pitch, 258; yaw, 342; Jettison time 147:59:30.
146:03:28 Carr: Roger, Dick and the last one in your CSM P76 PAD. GET of TIG is 149:28:54.5; Delta-VX, minus 0181.1; Delta-VY, plus 0060.3; Delta-VZ, plus 0003.6.
146:04:14 Gordon: Roger. Copy 149:28:54.5; X, minus 0181.1; Y, plus 0060.3; Z, plus 0003.6.
146:04:26 Carr: That's affirmative, Dick.
146:04:30 Gordon: And what was that, anyway?
146:04:39 Carr: That'll be the...
146:04:40 Gordon: In other words, now that I've got it, what do I do with it?
146:04:43 Carr: If you want to track the LM, Dick, this is the data that you need for tracking.
146:04:50 Gordon: Oh, that my P76 PAD. Okay?
146:05:01 Gordon: Thank you, Jerry, I understand.
146:05:03 Carr: Roger, Dick. [Long pause.]
146:05:31 Carr: Intrepid, Houston.
146:05:39 Bean: Go ahead, Houston.
146:05:41 Carr: Roger, Al. When you get a moment here, before you go LOS, we've got a couple of items. Number l: We'd like a few more words if you can on what it was you saw dangling from the CSM; I think you called it a separation package or something like that, and also we'd like to see you go back to your primary LiOH canister, and give us a look at it and see if it goes off on the CO2, again.
146:06:08 Conrad: Okay, we'll do that. We're a little bit suspicious of it because we had some erratic readings with our CO2. We'll go back to primary right now - Houston, the - It looks like some of the stuff we used to get back at the SEP plane on Gemini, except it looked like a piece of metal - it was about 3 feet long and about an inch wide, that was just curling up off the back there, right at the SEP plane.
146:06:43 Carr: Roger, Pete.
146:06:52 Carr: Clipper, Houston. I've got a Rev 33 map update for you.
146:07:03 Gordon: Hey, Jerry, can we skip this one? We're kind of busy right now.
146:07:07 Carr: Sure can, Dick.
146:07:10 Gordon: Okay. Just holler at us when we go around the corner. We'll be looking for you.
146:07:14 Carr: Okay, that takes care of the paper work for this pass.
146:07:20 Gordon: Thank you, pal. [Long pause.]
This is Apollo Control, Houston. It is now 146 hours, 7 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 12. There were a series of Pads passed up to both Yankee Clipper and Intrepid. The GET - among those the GET for the ascent stage deorbit burn was passed along, which gave a Time Of Ignition at 149 hours, 28 minutes 17 seconds, and we'll standby and continue to monitor.
146:07:37 Bean: How long before LOS, Houston?
146:07:40 Carr: We've got 18 minutes and about 30 seconds now.
146:07:46 Bean: Roger.
Long comm break.
146:13:40 Conrad: Dick, can you take a look in the tunnel?
Comm break.
146:16:47 Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston.
146:16:52 Gordon: Go ahead.
146:16:54 Carr: Roger, Dick. When you get a second, I've got some DAP data for you and a couple of switches for you to check.
146:17:05 Gordon: Okay. Will I need the DAP data?
146:17:08 Carr: Yes. It looks like a couple of registers need changing.
146:17:17 Gordon: Go ahead with it.
146:17:20 Carr: Roger. R-1 should be 61101; R-2 is 01111. and check your A-C Roll, Auto Select valve switches to the Off position. And UPTLM to Block. Over,
146:17:50 Gordon: Okay. Okay, Jerry. I'll get that after a bit, but I'm still trying to get this stuff over here to the CSM.
146:17:58 Carr: Okay, Dick.
146:18:05 Gordon: Hey, Pete. I'm maneuvering to the Jettison attitude. Don't let it worry you. Don't worry.
146:18:16 Conrad: I won't. [Long pause.]
146:18:56 Conrad: Can you get it?
146:19:05 Gordon: I think so. [Long pause.]
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 146 hours, 19 minutes now into the flight. We're less than 7 minutes away now from a Loss Of Signal with Apollo 12. We'll stand by and continue to monitor.
146:19:43 Bean: Yes, Pete. I think so.
146:25:10 Carr: Yankee Clipper and Intrepid, this is Houston. We're 1 minute from LOS. We're looking for AOS at 147:12. Over.
146:25:22 Bean: Intrepid, Roger.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 146 hours, 27 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 12. We've had Loss Of Signal with Apollo 12 now passing above the far side of the Moon. We'll recap at this time a couple of the maneuvers that were performed in the process of bringing Intrepid and Yankee Clipper back together again. To recap the Constant Delta Height maneuver was performed at 144 hours, no minutes and 1.5 seconds with a Delta-V of 13.8 feet per second. It placed Intrepid into an orbit with an apolune of 60.2 nautical miles and a perilune of 52.6 nautical miles. At 144 hours, 36 minutes, 29 seconds, the Terminal Phase Initiate maneuver was performed with a Delta-V of 28.5 feet per second giving an orbit of 73.6 by 58.6 nautical miles. We're presently looking at a LM deorbit burn which will return the ascent stage of Intrepid back to the lunar surface at 149 hours, 55 minutes, 51 seconds. For this return trip to the moon for Intrepid we'll see a velocity of 55.08 feet per second. The coordinates for impact are currently logged at 3.3378 degrees south and 23.4109 degrees west. We reacquire Apollo 12 at 147 hours, 12 minutes, and at that time we would expect to find Commander Pete Conrad and Lunar Module pilot Alan Bean completing their transfer back to the command module. We're at 146 hours, 29 minutes into the flight; and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 147 hours, 3 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 12. Apollo 12 continuing on its pass above the back side of the Moon. Meanwhile in Mission Control Center, Houston, Flight Director Glynn Lunney has come in somewhat early to replace Flight Director Pete Frank. Most of the Flight Controllers on the Pete Frank Orange Shift are still at Mission Control; however, the change of shift briefing will be held at 2:30 as previously scheduled and will feature Flight Director Pete Frank and Capsule Communicator Jerry Carr. We have a correction to make to an earlier Ground Elapsed Time which we passed along for the ascent stage deorbit. We identified a GET of 149 hours, 55 minutes, 51 seconds as the Time Of Ignition. It is, in fact, the forecast time for impact on the lunar surface. We have 147 hours, 04 minutes into the flight; and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
