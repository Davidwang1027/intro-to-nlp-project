This is Apollo Control at 144 hours, 07 minutes into the mission. At the present time, the spacecraft is coming up on Hawaii and the crew, during this pass, will have an opportunity to view one of those volcanoes that we understand is active on the island of Hawaii, the volcano Kilauea. Later on in this pass, they are scheduled to attempt two more landmark trackings, one of these sites is the city of El Paso and the other in south Africa on the western coast, will be Walvis Bay. During the first two tracking exercises that - actually three were scheduled, the crew successfully carried out two of them. The third site was covered by - obscured by clouds. This landmark tracking, of course, will be of value to a subsequent mission to the Moon, where the astronauts would be able to update their orbital information in lunar orbit, from onboard information, and supplemented by ground tracking updates. We now have acquired at Hawaii and we will be putting a call to the crew shortly. We will stand by for that.
HAWAII (REV 91)
144:10:33 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
144:10:36 Schirra: Go ahead.
144:10:39 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. I have your block 16 data, whenever you are ready to copy. [Long pause]
144:11:02 Schirra: Go ahead, Jack.
144:11:04 Swigert: Okay, 093 dash 4 A (Able) plus 310 minus 1620 146 plus 58 plus 14 3420, 094 dash 4 Able plus 305 minus 1619 148 plus 34 plus 16 3452, 095 dash 4 Able plus 257 minus 1630 150 plus 09 plus 20 3350, 096 dash 3 Able plus 313 plus 1339 151 plus 25 plus 41 3430, 097 dash 3 Able plus 299 plus 1339 153 plus 01 plus 35 3455, 098 dash 3 Charlie plus 206 plus 1419 154 plus 38 plus 44 3101. End. [Pause]
144:13:47 Cunningham: Roger. Readback follows: 093 dash 4 Able plus 310 plus minus 1620 146 plus 58 plus 14, 3420, 094 dash 4 Able plus 305 minus 1619 148 plus 34 16 3452, 095 dash 4 Able plus 257 minus 1630 150 plus 09 plus 20 3350, 096 dash 3 Able plus 313 plus 1339 151 plus 25 plus 41 3430, 097 dash 3 Able plus 299 plus 1339 153 plus 01 plus 35 3455, 098 dash 3 Charlie plus 206 plus 1419 154 plus 38 plus 44 3101. Over.
144:14:49 Swigert: Roger. That is correct.
Comm break.
HUNTSVILLE through BERMUDA (REV 91)
144:15:58 Communications technician: Huntsville AOS.
Comm break.
144:17:22 Communications technician: Huntsville AOS. [Long pause]
144:17:40 Communications technician: Huntsville AOS.
Long comm break.
144:21:35 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, do you have much this pass because we're going to be pretty well tied up throwing cameras back and forth. [Pause]
144:21:41 Swigert: Nothing except the morning news which I can read whenever you are able to ... [Pause]
144:21:47 Cunningham: We'll wait.
144:21:49 Swigert: Fine.
Long comm break.
We are having a relatively quiet pass over the United States at this time. The crew indicated they would be quite busy taking photographs and we expect that they will be attempting shortly to get some additional pictures of Hurricane Gladys as they move out over the Gulf of Mexico and across the Florida penisula. We will continue to monitor for conversations.
HUNTSVILLE through BERMUDA (REV 92)
144:27:41 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. Could you tell us which one you will be on when you switch? [Pause]
144:27:47 Schirra: Able.
144:27:49 Swigert: Roger. Understand. Able. [Pause]
144:27:56 Schirra: Roger. We're coming into the eye. [Pause]
144:28:01 Swigert: Say again, Wally.
144:28:02 Schirra: We'll catch you near the eye of the hurricane.
144:28:04 Swigert: Okay. Real fine.
144:28:06 Schirra: It will be south of us. Man, that's really a spinner. [Pause]
144:28:12 Swigert: I copy.
144:28:14 Schirra: It's really a very good definition here. It starts, and you can see the start of it right below us now. We're just going over the begining of it. It's wide open to the west. [Long pause]
144:28:46 Schirra: It's a very spectacular view. The - there are a lot of broken clouds around the edges of it, but it tightens up in the center. A reel tight vortex and a spotty few high cu - thunderstorms about 100 miles outward - 150 miles off the center. There is a wide blue area, and then it tightens up in the center and reaches a peak just like the thunderstorms we described in South America. [Long pause]
144:29:11 Swigert: Roger. Copy that. [Pause]
144:29:18 Schirra: Standby for mark. We are due south. [Long pause]
144:29:29 Schirra: Stand by.
144:29:30 Schirra: Mark. [Pause]
144:29:37 Swigert: Wally, was that the mark right over the eye?
144:29:40 Schirra: That's affirm. The eye is south of us about - oh, I'd say 200 miles, 150 miles. [Pause]
144:29:46 Swigert: Okay. [Long pause]
144:30:12 Schirra: Jack, on that run, we ran the 16 mm movie camera at 1 frame per second for a strip back from the west coast, LA through the hurricane. We ran the Panatomic film with red and green filters from the west coast through El Paso. We ran the S0121 from El Paso through the hurricane, including Houston. The chief landmark tracking on El Paso - I'll have Donn fill you on that. [Long pause]
144:30:43 Swigert: Okay. Real fine, Wally.
144:30:45 Schirra: Other than that, we are doing nothing. [Pause]
144:30:49 Eisele: You should have seen it up here; it looked like squirrels in a cage.
144:30:52 Swigert: Roger.
144:30:54 Eisele: Log this, Jack. Frame 142 is where we completed taking pictures of the hurricane at this time. I can't quite read - the MET here at 31, and just prior to that, we took three or four shots of the Houston area, which is wide open, the whole area down there. [Long pause]
144:31:17 Schirra: Clear Lake stood out like a bell. [Pause]
144:31:21 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
144:31:23 Eisele: Magazine F.
144:31:25 Schirra: That's been one of our best passes today. [Pause]
144:31:30 Eisele: It almost made us homesick.
144:31:33 Swigert: Roger.
144:31:34 Schirra: We plan to drop in in a few days. [Pause]
144:31:40 Swigert: Roger. Understand. [Pause]
144:31:44 Eisele: Jack, I ended doing an unknown landmark. The AUTO optics brought it in the sextant, but it was moving so fast, I got behind it, and never did get a mark on the runway. It was a pistol, though. You really got to get on it in a hurry because it is whistling by, so I ended up taking a little spot out in the desert and did an unknown landmark instead. [Long pause]
144:32:07 Swigert: Okay. Copy that, Donn. [Pause]
144:32:12 Eisele: Incidentally, the tracking pass itself, in general, is fairly simple to do if you get on it fast enough. The - I guess the hard part for me is in the procedural aspects of flipping switches and going through the program; meanwhile, the target is whistling by.
Comm break.
144:34:32 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
144:34:34 Schirra: Go ahead.
144:34:35 Swigert: Roger. we would like you to switch to the secondary tanks in quad Charlie; give us a mark when you do it. [Long pause]
144:34:47 Schirra: You want the main OFF first or the secondary on first? [Pause]
144:34:51 Swigert: Secondary on first.
144:34:53 Schirra: Roger. Stand by.
144:34:55 Schirra: MARK.
144:34:56 Schirra: Charlie on.
144:34:57 Schirra: Primary Charlie is coming off.
144:34:59 Schirra: MARK.
144:35:02 Swigert: Okay. We are about to lose you over Bermuda here; we will pick you up at Ascension at 144 plus 39. [Pause]
144:35:09 Schirra: Roger.
Comm break.
144:36:18 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
144:36:20 Schirra: Go ahead.
144:36:21 Swigert: Walt, did you put any high bit rate in the DSE this last rev? [Pause]
144:36:27 Cunningham: That's affirm.
144:36:28 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
144:36:29 Schirra: We put it on when Donn was getting his state vector updates in. [Pause]
144:36:34 Swigert: Okay. [Pause]
144:36:38 Eisele: Would you like to hear when we have put on? It probably screws up your dump schedule a little bit, doesn't it? [Pause]
144:36:47 Swigert: I got a nod down here on that question.
144:36:50 Eisele: Okay. We will try and do that - [Long pause]
144:37:40 Swigert: And, Walt, on the landmark tracking: about all we need to get is low bit rate. [Pause]
144:37:47 Cunningham: Understand. All you need is low bit rate for the landmark tracking. [Pause]
144:37:51 Swigert: Okay. And we're going to lose you here Ascension at 144:45.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We've had LOS now of the spacecraft from Antigua. A very active and interesting pass there on the latter part as Wally Schirra gave us a birdseye view from space, of hurricane Gladys, which he described as a real spinner and a spectacular view. He seemed to have been especially impressed with the tight vortex of the storm. Eisele also commented that, as you heard, on how busy things were in the cabin at the time. Describing he and his fellow crewmen as looking like a bunch of squirrels in a cage, and of course, we'll look forward to seeing some of the photos that the crew referred to and they apparently got some good ones on that pass, both still and motion picture of the Houston area and out on across the Gulf getting some good views of hurricane Gladys. We'll be picking up the spacecraft again over the Ascension tracking station. Acquisition due there in about 6 minutes. This is Apollo Control at 144 hours, 40 minutes into the flight.
This is Apollo Control at 144 hours, 45 minutes and the spacecraft is coming up on the Tananarive or rather the Ascension Station at this time, and we have just acquired CapCom Jack Swigert, he has put in a call to the crew.
ASCENSION (REV 92)
144:45:30 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Pause]
144:45:34 Schirra: Roger.
Long comm break.
Shortly after this pass over Ascension is completed, the crew will be scheduled to conduct another land mark tracking exercise as they move over Southwest Africa. They will attempt to acquire Walvis Bay in the scanning telescope and once they have picked it up there, they'll transfer to the sextant and attempt to track and feed mark inputs into a computer. This information can then be used to determine their orbital parameters.
144:51:17 Swigert: Apollo 7, Honston. We are 1 minute LOS Ascension; Tananarive at 145 plus 01. [Pause]
144:51:26 Schirra: Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. The spacecraft has now gone over the horizon and is out of range of the Ascension Tracking Station. We'll acquire next at Tananarive and that's scheduled to occur in about 8 or 9 minutes from now. Flight surgeon Dr. Hawkins reports that the crew conditions appear to be improving; the crew reports that they are getting caught up on their sleep, the water in-take is good, and he says that Schirra and Eisele both report their colds are now somewhat improved. Walt Cunningham continues to report that there is some congestion, but says he feels fine. The space flight meteorology group said this morning that weather conditions for the flight of Apollo 7 will continue to be satisfactory over the next 24 hours, and in the West Atlantic landing areas, the weather will be partly cloudy with a few showers. In the East Atlantic skies will be fair to partly cloudy and in the Western Pacific landing areas the weather will be mostly cloudy with a few showers. In the Mid Pacific area, weather will be fair to partly cloudy, and as we heard, the astronauts again this morning, got a good look at hurricane Gladys as the storm moves across the west coast of Florida. But later this afternoon it is anticipated that they will get a good view of Tropical Storm Gloria, located in the West Pacific. The spacecraft is due to pass almost directly over that storm. At 144 hours, 54 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control.
144:58:26 Eisele (onboard): Time - time, 144 hours 58 minutes; just completed landmark tracking on landmark 225. I've got five marks. Four showed up as processed after the marking was done, and all the updates were zeros. The updated landmark coordinates are minus 22879, plus 07227, plus 0015. That's NOUN 89. Correction, Bill, I have - register 3 is plus 00015. Again, the computer chose to update the landmark position rather than its own state vector.
This is Apollo Control at 145 hours, 3 minutes. The spacecraft has just passed from daylight into darkness crossing the terminator, and CapCom Jack Swigert has put in a call to the crew. We'll pick up there.
TANANARIVE (REV 92)
145:02:28 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananartve. Standing by. [Long pause]
145:02:30 Eisele (onboard): Got that.
145:02:48 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7.
145:02:51 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
145:02:53 Eisele: We got a landmark on that last one and got five good marks on all [garble] updates and put the coordinates of land rate, the update coordinates on the tape. You should get it when it comes down.
Comm break.
145:03:15 Eisele (onboard): It will change them a very slight amount.
145:03:20 Eisele (onboard): It appears we are not updating our own state vector at all. We are merely letting the computer decide where it thinks the landmarks are located.
145:05:35 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We are close to LOS Tananarive. We'll have ARIA on S-band at 145 plus 12.
Very long comm break.
145:05:47 Eisele (onboard): Roger.
This is Mission Control. We are about to lose acquisition of the spacecraft over Tananarive. The communications on that pass were not too good, as the spacecraft was passing well south of the tracking station. Just barely clipping the end off the acquisition circle. You heard the crew advise that they had gotten, been able to acquire the land mark on the southwest coast of Africa in the scanning telescope and had gotten 5 marks on it as they passed over through the sextant. The next station to acquire will be one of the 5 ARIA aircraft; that's scheduled at 145 hours, 12 minutes. Following that we will have a pass over Carnarvon, and on up just barely catching Guam over the Hawaiian Islands. At 145 hours, 7 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
145:07:19 Communications technician: Ascension, Houston.
145:07:23 Communications technician: [Garble]. How do you read?
145:07:24 Communications technician): This is Houston COMM TECH.
145:07:31 Communications technician: Ascension COMM TECH, Houston COMM TECH, net 1.
145:07:35 Communications technician: I read you 5 by. How me?
145:07:37 Communications technician: Roger, you are loud and clear. Thank you.
145:09:54 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
145:09:56 Schirra: Roger, thank you.
145:09:58 Eisele (onboard): Okay, CDR 15 clicks on the water gun.
145:14:41 Cunningham (onboard): I don't know if it has been reported up here before but I have seen Magellanic clouds on several different occasions at night out here.
This is Apollo Control at 145 hours 16 minutes. We'll be coming within range of the station at Carnarvon shortly as the spacecraft passes just parallel to the northwestern Australian coast and out over the Pacific Ocean. We'll stand by now for the call to the crew from CapCom Jack Swigert.
CARNARVON (REV 92)
145:16:10 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
145:16:14 Eisele: Roger. Honston.
Comm break.
145:18:43 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
145:18:48 Eisele: Say again, Jack.
145:18:50 Swigert: Opposite omni, please.
Long comm break.
145:23:12 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Carnarvon; we'll pick you up at Guam at 145 plus 28. [Pause]
145:23:21 Eisele: Roger.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We're about to lose acquistion with the spacecraft over Carnarvon. We'll be acquiring next from the station at Guam. Coming up on this pass the Apollo 7 crew is scheduled to attempt another star count in daylight with the onboard sextant. The flight plan calls for that activity to occur as they pass over their upcoming stateside pass from Guaymas, Mexico, and out over the site at Mila. At 145 hours 25 minutes into the flight this is Apollo Control.
145:26:29 Schirra (onboard): The two stars sighted were Fomalhaut and Diphda, star angle distance 00001, tracking angle minus 00039, plus 00042, minus 00007.
145:26:44 Cunningham (onboard): That was at 145:26:30.
145:28:37 Cunningham (onboard): Been rolling, been rolling, single CHANNEL ROLL. We counted the pulses. We developed a 2-degree-per-second roll rate, 0.2-degree-per secord roll rate, rolling to the left (laughter). It took seven pulses. It put on a two-tenths of a second, - degree-per-second - roll rate. Seven pulses put out nicely to zero, and in rolling back, it would take eight pulses for 0.2 degree per second.
GUAM (REV 92)
145:29:42 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Guam.
145:29:47 Swigert: Stand by. [Garble] [Pause]
145:29:56 Swigert: And, 7, we'll have a state vector update to send you over Hawaii. [Pause]
145:30:03 Cunningham (onboard): Roger. You mean you don't believe all these good landmarks?
145:30:12 Unidentifiable crewmember: [Garble]. [Long pause]
145:30:48 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
145:30:52 Schirra: Go ahead, Jack.
145:30:54 Swigert: Okay. I have a PAD on this landmark traking test that you're going to do here over pass begining Hawaii. [Long pause]
145:31:16 Eisele: Go ahead, partner.
145:31:18 Swigert: Okay. The first landmark. 10; it's south of ground track 65 miles, GET 145 plus 56, shaft 043, trunnion 34. The weather's clear at this landmark. Second landmark, 142; 18 miles north of ground track, GET 146 plus 17, shaft 327, trunnion 31. Looks like it's about five-tenths covered.
145:32:27 Eisele: Roger. We just got two this time. Jack?
145:32:30 Swigert: Affirmative.
145:32:31 Eisele: I see. I'll try to squeeze in an unknown one in the middle somewhere. [Pause]
145:32:36 Swigert: Okay. Good. [Long pause]
145:32:54 Swigert: And, Walt, could we get you to switch the S-band AUX TV switch OFF? [Pause]
145:33:01 Cunningham: That's a good idea. [Long pause]
145:33:46 Swigert: We pick up Hawaii at 145 plus 21. [Pause]
145:33:53 Cunningham: Roger. [Pause]
145:33:57 Swigert: The last of the news that I didn't finish this morning: the National Institute of Health announced today that they have a development of a vaccine to prevent German measles. Tommy Smith won a gold medal in 200-meter dash with a world record time of 19.8. Bob Seagren picked up the United States' sixth gold medal by winning the pole vault, with a world record of 17 feet 8 and 1/2 inches. George Foreman of Houston won a split decision in the opening round of the Olympic boxing.
145:34:35 Cunningham: Sounds like the home team is doing okay down there.
145:34:38 Swigert: It sure is. [Long pause]
145:35:03 Schirra: Jack, that hurricane is really a doozy. I haven't seen anithing like that, over. [Pause]
145:35:08 Swigert: It's moving north, Wally. It should hit the coast of Florida, around Tallahassee. [Pause]
145:35:16 Schirra: What are the highest winds on the outskirts?
Long comm break.
145:35:33 Schirra (onboard): It is quite interesting to see the vortex, it really is pronounced.
This is Apollo Control at 145 hours 42 minutes. We recently completed a pass over Guam and we'll play that back for you in it's entirety, and then pick up with the pass over Hawaii.
HAWAII through ANTIGUA (REV 92)
145:42:00 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
145:42:01 Schirra: Loud and clear.
145:42:03 Swigert: Roger. We would like to send you a state vector update whenever you're ready. [Pause]
145:42:11 Eisele: Go, man. [Pause]
145:42:21 Swigert: Okay. Coming up, 7, and I'm ready to read you the NAV check whenever you are ready to copy. [Long pause]
145:43:14 Schirra: Go ahead, Jack.
145:43:16 Swigert: Okay. GET 144 plus 50 plus 0000 minus 0936 minus 00891 1013. [Long pause]
145:43:43 Schirra: Is your update in now?
145:43:45 Swigert: Affirmative. The update is in. The computer is yours. [Long pause]
145:44:32 Schirra: Here's your readback, Jack. [Pause]
145:44:36 Swigert: Go ahead. [Long pause]
145:44:47 Schirra: Houston, did you copy the readback?
145:44:49 Swigert: Negative. I didn't copy the readback.
145:44:51 Schirra: It's on the DSKY.
145:44:54 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
145:44:59 Swigert: Copy the read back.
145:45:02 Schirra: That's a pretty good readback, hey?
145:45:04 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
145:45:39 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
Comm break.
145:48:45 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
Long comm break.
145:55:37 Schirra: Jack, frames 143 and 144 are of San Diego. [Pause]
145:55:41 Swigert: Roger. Copy that.
145:55:44 Schirra: Loud and clear. There you can see all the way to north Island and MIRAMAR, the whole scene. [Long pause]
145:55:59 Swigert: And, Wally, I have this sextant star count PAD that I can give you any time. [Pause]
145:56:06 Schirra: We'll wait till we finish this one landmark here.
145:56:08 Swigert: Okay. No hurry.
145:56:09 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause]
145:56:24 Schirra: Got five marks.
Comm break.
145:58:26 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7.
145:58:29 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
145:58:30 Eisele: Roger. Are you getting the data off of the computer? [Pause]
145:58:34 Swigert: Affirmative.
145:58:36 Eisele: Roger. This is the alternate navigator doing the marking. [Pause]
145:58:41 Swigert: Roger.
145:58:42 Eisele: And we again got all zero's on the DELTA-R - DELTA-V updates, and we have some changes to the landmark location on the lat, long, and attitude. It turns out that point is 3600 feet under water. [Long pause]
145:58:57 Swigert: Okay. Roger. Copy that. [Pause]
145:59:02 Eisele: We took a sounding. [Pause]
145:59:11 Schirra: Your weather looks good out on the Gulf. No thunderheads, a little bit of scattered cirrus way south of Beaumont, and that's just about it. [Pause]
145:59:19 Swigert: Roger.
145:59:22 Schirra: Nothing west of you. All the way over to Freeport, it's clear as a hell. [Long pause]
145:59:41 Swigert: Wally, we're trying to save some CAL 25 weather for you. [Pause]
145:59:45 Schirra: Yes, I would like to get some of that. This isn't bad sailing here. Got a pretty big spinnaker out now.
HAWAII through ANTIGUA (REV 93)
146:00:00 Schirra: Thanks for getting that storm out of the way. I appreciate that. [Pause]
146:00:05 Swigert: Okay. Let me know when you are ready to copy that sextant star count PAD. [Long pause]
146:00:42 Swigert: And, Wally, something else that you might note here. We didn't copy any indication of a canister change or Of the O2 purge which was about 4 hours ago. [Long pause]
146:00:55 Schirra: Yes, we've made number 12 canister change and the O2 purge. [Pause]
146:00:59 Swigert: Okay. I understand they are both complete. [Pause]
146:01:06 Schirra: Four optical on the O2 purge?
146:01:09 Swigert: Roger. That was the one at 141:30. [Pause]
146:01:17 Schirra: We didn't check that off; we owe you that one; the canister was changed. [Pause]
146:01:21 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
146:01:22 Eisele: Roger. We were busy TV-ing it, I think about purge time. [Pause]
146:01:27 Schirra: Yes, we were on camera then. You know we weren't doing it.
146:01:30 Swigert: Roger. That is why we thought we would just ask.
146:01:32 Schirra: Oh, you're sneaky.
146:01:34 Eisele: Very good.
146:01:37 Schirra: Now you know why we don't like the TV cameras.
146:01:40 Eisele: Ready on the update.
146:01:43 Swigert: Okay. This is star 23, roll 352, pitch 041, yaw 006; star 31, the same roll, pitch, and yaw settings. This will get you within - these stars are within 35 degrees of the sun LOS. [Long pause]
146:02:17 Eisele: Roger. GET of sighting?
146:02:20 Swigert: Roger. 147 plus 31. [Pause]
146:02:27 Eisele: Same number for both of them? [Pause]
146:02:31 Swigert: Roger. That is the same number for both. [Long pause]
146:03:18 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7.
146:03:20 Swigert: Go ahead, 7. [Pause]
146:03:25 Swigert: Go ahead.
146:03:26 Eisele: Roger. I was wondering if we could - if we could get an update for these 23 lunar landmark stars business? [Pause]
146:03:36 Swigert: Okay -
146:03:37 Eisele: Like some attitude to fly to and the approximate time to do it. I could find it by myself, but it might help a little if we had some ideas as to what - I mean, what roll angle ar pitch angle it will be in. [Pause]
146:03:50 Swigert: Okay. In work.
146:03:51 Eisele: Okay.
146:03:53 Schirra: Jack, frames 145, 146, and 147 were taken at 03 - at 03 minutes. [Long pause]
146:04:10 Schirra: Houston, do you copy?
146:04:11 Swigert: Roger. Copy that.
146:04:13 Schirra: Roger.
Comm break.
146:06:38 Cunningham: Frame 178 taken at 07 30. [Pause]
146:06:44 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
146:06:49 Cunningham: That's on magazine Sierra.
146:06:52 Swigert: Copy.
Comm break.
146:08:25 Cunningham: Frames 149, 150 taken at 07 35. [Garble] in minutes and seconds. [Long pause]
146:08:39 Swigert: Copy. [Pause]
146:08:46 Schirra: We must be doing a bit more tracking today. [Pause]
146:08:52 Swigert: Say again, Wally.
146:08:54 Schirra: Did we do perigee?
146:08:57 Swigert: You are just passing perigee now. [Pause]
146:09:04 Schirra: Okay. We got a pitch rate change for noting.
146:09:06 Swigert: Okay. Copy. [Pause]
146:09:10 Schirra: [Garble] pitched up [garble] degrees local vertical way back up to SCS. [Long pause]
146:09:23 Swigert: I didn't copy that last, Wally.
146:09:25 Schirra: That was pitch down 30 degrees, and it came right back up, almost to SCS. I had to stop it. [Pause]
146:09:32 Swigert: Okay. Copy. [Pause]
146:09:38 Schirra: We've got an outside station coming in beautifully right now. It seems like every time we come through here. [Pause]
146:09:46 Swigert: Roger. Understand.
146:09:47 Schirra: playing "True Love." [Long pause]
146:10:24 Cunningham: Roger. We are stable now right at the perigee attitude. [Pause]
146:10:29 Swigert: Roger. Copy. We are about 1 minute LOS Antigua; we pick you up over Ascension at 146 plus 19. [Pause]
146:10:39 Cunningham: Roger.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We have just lost contact with the spacecraft over Antigua as the spacecraft moves down over the northeastern coast of the South American continent, just parallel to the coast. You heard Wally Schirra note a phenomenon they had noted before on this mission, what appears to be a very small amount of aerodynamic drag the spacecraft encountered at perigee. Schirra reported that they were in a 30 degree pitch down attitude and for no apparent reason, the spacecraft pitched back up into the horizontal attitude. At the present time, the spacecraft is in an orbit about 153 nautical miles at its highest point and slightly under 90 nautical miles at the low point. This is essentially the orbit that we have been in since that third service propulsion system burn. We have noted a slight decrease in the apogee since that time. The perigee following the burn was 90 miles, essentially the same as it is now. Apogee immediately following the burn was about 160 nautical miles, so we have lost about 7 nautical miles in apogee, but perigee has remained essentially the same. We will acquire the spacecraft again at Ascension and acquisition there is scheduled to occur at 146 hours 20 minutes, or about 7 minutes from now. This is Apollo Control at 146 hours 13 minutes.
This is Apollo Control at 146 hours 20 minutes, and we have just put in a call to the crew over Ascension. We'll pick that up now.
ASCENSION (REV 93)
146:20:04 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Pause]
146:20:11 Cunningham: Roger ...
146:20:12 Eisele: Roger. Jack, we just had a very anomalous sort of pass here - wrote it in the data off our book [garble] by block 42 [garble] did the marks and the thing came into view about a minute and a half earlier than the time you gave us. It was away off to the north, more than just 18 miles; in fact, they had to yaw 20 degrees to even be able to see it, and anyway, managed finally to get two marks on it before we lost it. They got three new updates for DELTA-R DELTA-V, but they got some huge changes on the landmark coordinates. [Long pause]
146:20:52 Swigert: Okay. We copied that, Donn. [Pause]
146:20:58 Eisele: It's conceivable he could have marked on the wrong point, but I don't think he could have been that far off. [Pause]
146:21:03 Swigert: Okay. We have some information on this P23 Moon star sighting. [Pause]
146:21:12 Eisele: Okay. Stand by. [Long pause]
146:21:30 Flight: FAL Flight, I'm still standing by for your reply. [Long pause]
146:21:47 Flight: Attitude? Right. [Long pause]
146:22:05 Eisele: Roger. Go ahead with your update, Jack.
146:22:08 Swigert: Okay, Donn. At a GET of 146 plus 00 plus 00, a roll of 347, pitch 097, yaw of 011 should be the landmark line of sight on the moon. [Long pause]
146:22:37 Eisele: Roger. Stand by, Jack. My pencil crapped out. [Long pause]
146:22:50 Eisele: Roger. I've got 146 on the hour. Is that right? [Pause]
146:22:54 Swigert: No, sir. 146 plus 40 plus 00, the roll 347, pitch 097, yaw 011 will put the landmark line of sight on the Moon. [Long pause]
146:23:19 Eisele: Okay.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal now from Ascension. The next station to acquire will be the tracking station at Tananarive. At 146 hours 26 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 146 hours, 36 minutes. Apollo 7 is crossing the southern tip of Africa and coming up on the station at Tananarive. We'll stand by for a call to the crew from CapCom Jack Swigert.
TANANARIVE (REV 93)
146:38:04 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
146:38:06 Cunningham (onboard): Go ahead.
146:38:08 Eisele: Go ahead. [Pause]
146:38:16 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
146:38:17 Cunningham (onboard): Loud and clear.
146:38:19 Eisele: Roger.
146:38:21 Swigert: Donn, we got real poor COMM here at Tananarive; like to give you an updated GET for this Moon star sighting of 147 plus 00 plus 00. [Long pause]
146:38:38 Eisele: [Garble]. Jack. Is that a landmark? [Pause]
146:38:45 Swigert: Roger. That's P23, Moon star sighting. Time should be 147 plus 00 plus 00. [Long pause]
146:38:57 Eisele: [Garble] must be a little late on that. [Pause]
146:39:01 Swigert: Okay.
146:39:03 Eisele: [Garble] I had about 40 minutes of ATTITUDE HOLD giving.
146:39:06 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
146:39:09 Eisele: We're in ATTITUDE right now.
146:39:12 Swigert: Copy. [Pause]
146:39:17 Cunningham: Hey. Jack. Log another food bag failure - corncrowder today, meal 3 [garble]. [Pause]
146:39:26 Swigert: Walt, I didn't copy that; COMM is pretty poor here over Tananarive because of the low elevation angle on the antenna. We would like you to switch your TMP power to AUX for this COMM test that we are going to do over Guam. [Long pause]
146:39:43 Cunningham: Roger. When do you want me to switch?
146:39:46 Swigert: Right now. Walt. [Pause]
146:39:50 Cunningham: Okay. Done.
146:39:52 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
146:40:35 Swigert: 7, we are about 1 minute LOS Tananarive; we have a reak low angle pass at Carnarvon 146 plus 52.
Very long comm break.
This is Mission Control. We had a very difficult communications on that pass over Tananarive; the spacecraft passed the station just about on the horizon and will be acquiring at Carnarvon, Australia, in about 10 minutes from now and also that will be a low elevation pass, and we would expect rather brief and perhaps difficult communications through that station also. At 146 hours, 42 minutes, this is Apollo Control
This is Apollo Control at 146 hours, 52 minutes and we've just acquired the spacecraft at Carnarvon. We'll pick that up for you here.
CARNARVON (REV 93)
146:51:44 Eisele: [Garble] butterscotch pudding, but nobody'll take it. Walt and Wally are trying to con me out of my ham and applesauce by offerign me a whole meal for it. [Pause]
146:51:54 Cunningham (onboard): It's worth it. Sight unseen, I'll give a whole meal for it.
146:51:57 Eisele (onboard): Walt likes cocoa, so we can palm off the cocoa on him.
146:52:01 Cunningham (onboard): I guess I am the only sucker ...
146:52:04 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
146:52:07 Eisele: Roger.
146:52:09 Swigert: Roger. We just got you in the middle of your transmision, Donn. Could you say again? [Pause]
146:52:14 Eisele: Roger. We were just recording some comments on our food up here. [Pause]
146:52:18 Swigert: Okay.
146:52:21 Eisele: We were saying that Wally and I were trying to give away our butterscotch pudding, but nobody wants it. Walt likes to collect cocoa, so we can give our cocoa to him, and both of them were trying to con me out of my ham and applesauce. Walt offered me a whole meal for one dish. I guess the message is that we get a little tired off the very rich sweet things, and we still go for the meats and the fruits and the salads. [Long pause]
146:52:48 Swigert: Okay. Copy that. [Pause]
146:52:52 Cunningham: I tried to call you before over the last station. I had a corn chowder bag failure,the second one Of this type. It failed down where the spout comes out. It's failed down - right down where it goes into the bag itself, and the meal comes out some other hole. [Long pause]
146:53:10 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
146:53:11 Cunningham: And it always happens to my favorite food.
146:53:13 Swigert: Roger. This is about the best COMM we've had. It's an elevation angle less than 1 degree. [Long pause]
146:53:28 Cunningham: That's pretty sensational. [Long pause]
146:53:57 Swigert: We're 1 minute LOS Carnarvon; we'll pick you up at Guam at 147 plus 01. [Pause]
146:54:03 Eisele: Okay.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, we've lost acquisition with the spacecraft at Carnarvon as you heard on that pass. Crew apparently having lunch at this time. In a short while, CMP Donn Eisele is schedulds to begin his sleep period. We will be reacquiring the spacecraft over Guam. That acquisition scheduled at 147 hours, 1 minute or about 6 minutes from now. At 146, 56 minutes, this is Apollo Control
This is Apollo Control at 147 hours 1 minute. Now we are just about to put in a call to the spacecraft over Guam. Let's listen in.
GUAM (REV 93)
147:01:53 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Guam.
147:01:58 Cunningham: Roger.
147:02:00 Swigert: Walt, will you turn up your S-band volume? We'll start this COMM load check.
147:02:08 Cunningham: S-band volume up.
147:02:09 Swigert: Okay. [Long pause]
147:02:42 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
147:02:44 Cunningham: Roger. Houstcm, I'm reading you loud and clear.
147:02:46 Swigert: You are loud and clear, also. Welt, up over Hawaii, we're going to have a state vector and DAP load update for you - to send you. [Long pause]
147:03:05 Cunningham: Roger. [Pause]
147:03:12 Swigert: And after the DAP data load, we'd like to get a verification of NOUN 47 and NOUN 48. This is... [Pause]
147:03:22 Cunningham: You'd like verification of what?
147:03:23 Swigert: NOUN 47 and NOUN 48 in the DAP data load. [Pause]
147:03:33 Cunningham: Roger. Understand. So we'll go to ACCEPT on your call over Hawaii. [Pause]
147:03:37 Swigert: Okay. Real fine.
Comm break.
147:04:43 Swigert: Walt, if you're ready, I can give you the NAV check for this update over Hawaii - I can give it to you now. [Long pause]
147:04:59 Cunningham: We'll pick it up at Hawaii while you are uplinking us.
147:05:02 Swigert: Okay. No problem. [Long pause]
147:05:31 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7.
147:05:33 Swigert: Go ahead, 7. [Pause]
147:05:38 Swigert: Go ahead, Apollo 7.
147:05:41 Cunningham: Donn,'s turning his S-band up. Ne wants to give you his data. [Pause]
147:05:45 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7.
147:05:46 Swigert: Go ahead.
147:05:47 Eisele: Roger. I don't know if you read this on the computer. I've got P23 up, and I've got Alphard placed on landmark on the Moon, and these are the shaft and trunnion angles. Do you read them down there? [Long pause]
147:05:59 Swigert: Roger. I'm copying them.
147:06:00 Eisele: Okay. I'll tell you that was one whale of a lot easier than that crazy Earth horizon business. [Long pause]
147:06:12 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
Comm break.
147:08:59 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Guam; Hawaii at 147 plus 16.
Long comm break.
This is Mission Control. We've lost contact with the spacecraft over Guam. Our flight controllers here in Mission Control have been consistently pleased with the high quality of the unified S-band communications system, especially when we've have a high elevation pass such as this one on Guam where the spacecraft passed almost directly over head the station. We will acquire the spacecraft again over Hawaii, at 147 hours 17 minutes, that will be about 7 minutes from now. At 147 hours 11 minutes this is Apollo Control.
147:12:49 Cunningham (onboard): Day 7, meal B, we ...
147:12:52 Eisele (onboard): ... are we going to review the next one?
147:12:56 Cunningham (onboard): ... corn chowder food bag failed where the drinking spout goes into the bag. It pulled apart down - it was not an external leak. It was internal, it was where the drinking spout is scored. That's a similar failure to an earlier chocolate pudding bag failure. That's the third food bag failure that the LMP has sustained.
This is Apollo Control at 147 hours 17 minutes. The spacecraft is approaching Hawaii. We will have acquisition shortly and we will stand by for a call to the crew.
HAWAII through TEXAS (REV 93)
147:17:07 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. [Long pause]
147:17:22 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
147:17:25 Cunningham: Roger. Five-by.
147:17:26 Swigert: Okay. If you will go to ACCEPT, we will send you a NAV load and then a DAP update. [Long pause]
147:17:45 Schirra: Houston, can we wait on this pass? We've got a DTO going here, and we need the computer for it. [Pause]
147:17:51 Swigert: Okay. That is fine.
147:17:54 Cunningham: I'll take the PAD for the NAV check.
147:17:57 Swigert: Okay. GET 154 plus 30 plus 0000 plus 1486 plus 03724 1368. [Long pause]
147:18:20 Cunningham: Roger. Jack, we will take your update. We are in ACCEPT. [Pause]
147:18:25 Swigert: Okay. Coming up.
147:18:28 Cunningham: Okay. Readback follows: 154 30 four balls plus 1486 plus 03274 1438. Over. [Pause]
147:18:38 Swigert: Negative on the last one, Walt: 1368. [Pause]
147:18:43 Cunningham: 1368. Sorry. [Long pause]
147:19:28 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
147:19:30 Schirra: Go ahead.
147:19:32 Swigert: Okay. Wally, we are gradually picking up an increase in CO2 there. You may have gotten a bad canister at that last change. [Pause]
147:19:42 Schirra: Roger. See on this particular test here, by the way, this very brilliant star count test has us right up in the perigee torque area. We are going to really hose the fuel out. [Long pause]
147:19:56 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
147:19:59 Schirra: Now this one is on the experimenters, too. We are going to have some right interesting comments to make about celestial navigation when we get back. [Long pause]
147:20:11 Swigert: There are going to be lot of people who are going to be interested. [Pause]
147:20:16 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, we are like reading 1 mm; shouldn't we go ahead, let this thing hang in here until it gets up close to 76? [Pause]
147:20:24 Swigert: Roger. We are just trying to give you a little bit of a hack ahead of time, so you will know what to look for. [Pause]
147:20:30 Cunningham: Well, our criteria is 76, so we have not been concerned. It's just turned out to be the first one we've ever seen over one, that's all. [Pause]
147:20:37 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
147:21:26 Schirra: May we have the computer?
147:21:29 Swigert: Roger. 7, we would like to verify the DAP data load. Not at this tame, but some time later on. We would just like a verification on NOUN 47 and 47 in the DAP data load prior to tomorrow's burn. The computer is yours at this time.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 147 hours 24 minutes. We have gone beyond range now of the Hawaiian station and we will come back up with any conversation that develop between the crew and the ground over the Huntsville and from the Guaymas station.
147:27:18 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7.
147:27:21 Swigert: Go ahead, Apollo 7.
147:27:23 Cunningham: Roger. NOUN 47 plus two balls 164 plus - [Long pause]
147:27:41 Cunningham: Did you read?
147:27:43 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
147:27:45 Cunningham: Roger. Jack, did you read NOUN 47?
147:27:47 Swigert: Negative. Walt, you got it just as we were handing over stations here. Could you say it again? [Pause]
147:27:54 Cunningham: Can you read our DSKY? Can you read out DSKY, Jack? [Pause]
147:28:03 Swigert: Negative right now, Walt.
147:28:05 Cunningham: Okay. NOUN 47 pllus two balls 164 plus two balls 551 plus 29560. NOUN 48 minus three balls 76 minus three balls 47 plus 02110. Over. [Long pause]
147:28:24 Swigert: Okay. We copy that. Could you place your PMP power to NORMAL? [Pause]
147:28:30 Cunningham: It's in NORMAL.
147:28:31 Swigert: Copy. [Pause]
147:28:36 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, somebody might write down and leave it on my desk for when I get back how many different COMM modes they've checked out on this flight. [Pause]
147:28:44 Swigert: Okay. We'll get it to you.
Comm break.
147:30:06 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, do you have time for a map update? [Pause]
147:30:10 Swigert: Map update in work. [Long pause]
147:30:59 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. And I have your map update. [Pause]
147:31:04 Cunningham: Roger.
This is Apollo Control at 147 hours, 31 minutes. The spacecraft is now passing over Baja, California, and will be going down across the Mexican Continent, rather the country of Mexico and over the South American Continent. Coming up, the start of Rev 94. We just put in a call to the spacecraft from the Corpus Christi station, we'll join the conversation there." [Pause]
147:31:11 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. I have your map update.

147:34:41 Swigert: We are about 1 minute LOS. We'll pick you up at Tananarive at about 148 plus 09.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 147 hours, 37 minutes. We've had LOS now with the spacecraft. The next station to acquire will be Tananarive, off the southeast coast of Africa, and we'll pick up the spacecraft there in about 25 or 30 minutes. At 147 hours, 37 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apolle Control at 148 hours 09 minutes. The spacecraft is now crossing the southern tip Of Africa and are in the middle of a nightside pass. We will be acquiring at Tananarive shortly. At the present time, the crew should be involved in completing power down of the guidance and navigation system and the stabilization and control system aboard the spacecraft. Command module Donn Eisele is well into his sleep period, according to the flight Plan. We will stand by now tor acquisition at ?ananarive,
TANANARIVE (REV 94)
148:11:40 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. [Pause]
148:11:45 Schirra: Roger. Jack, read you loud and clear.
148:11:47 Swigert: Wally, I would like to ask you if you powered down? [Pause]
148:11:52 Schirra: Affirmative.
148:11:53 Swigert: Okay. Thank you.
148:11:55 Schirra: Find our suit - heat rate must have peaked about - a suit temperature of about 64 degrees just before power down - and held there for a while after power down. Assuming that it will improve with power up plus holding real great for 4 to 5 minutes, and then it's pretty hot. We felt the heat very easily. Read that? [Long pause]
148:12:28 Swigert: Roger. You were a little bit garbled, but I think we've got most of it. [Pause]
148:12:34 Schirra: Okay. On the star check: only the two stars called up by the program were seen, no others with the sextant. [Long pause]
148:12:48 Swigert: Roger. Understand.
148:12:51 Schirra: And today will be very busy, and tomorrow, we have the big burn - burn 5. [Pause]
148:12:58 Swigert: Go ahead.
148:13:00 Schirra: We are deleting the TV pass tomorrow. [Long pause]
148:13:13 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
148:13:15 Swigert: Roger. We copy that. We are digesting that, Wally. [Pause]
148:13:19 Schirra: Say again.
148:13:21 Swigert: We copy that.
148:13:22 Schirra (onboard): Okay, we were moving along like mad today.
148:13:23 Schirra: [Garble] back today, and it looked awful [garble] I didn't want to do it before our first burn, but it can foul up our time lines considerably. [Long pause]
148:13:34 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
148:13:37 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
148:13:43 Schirra: That's about all I have for you. [Long pause]
148:14:07 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
148:14:09 Schirra: Go ahead.
148:14:11 Swigert: Wally, is the suit temperature or cabin temperature getting a little more comfortable now that you have powered down? [Pause]
148:14:18 Schirra: That's affirm. I should have told you: we are down to about 58 degrees right now. [Pause]
148:14:23 Swigert: Okay. copy.
148:14:25 Schirra: We're doing fine. [Long pause]
148:14:44 Schirra: Jack, in your planning for subsequent maneuvers, you should try to avoid being out at SCS or PVS at more than 20 degrees as you pass through perigee. Over. [Long pause]
148:14:58 Swigert: Okay. I copied that, Wally.
148:15:00 Schirra: Roger. You're going to have to save that - [Long pause]
148:15:12 Schirra (onboard): [Garble] that burn 4. On burn 5 we better ease up a little bit on ...
148:15:14 Schirra: [Garble] the fuel and the attitude. [Pause]
148:15:20 Swigert: Okay. Understand. We are getting pretty close to LOS Tananarive; we will pick you up at Guam at 148 plus 36. [Pause]
148:15:29 Schirra: Roger.
148:15:30 Swigert: And Mercury at 148 plus 33.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 148 hours 18 minutes. We had some garble on the comunications that time over Tananarive. We did copy Schirra's comment that the temperature of the gases flowing into the cabin, I believe that would be the suit inlet temperature reading, since the crew is not wearing suit at this time, but that still provides the reading for the gas flow into the cabin and he said it had gotten up to 64 degrees during the time that the spacecraft was fully powered up. Now that the guidance and navigation system has been powered down, along with the stablization and control system, Schirra noticed that the cabin temperature had dropped down to about 58 degrees. A 64 degree reading is still low within the comfort level for airflow into the cabin, the 58 is a little bit more nominal, however. Our next acquisition of the spacecraft will be over the tracking ship Mercury and we will have overlapping coverage there from Guam, scheduled to pick the spacecraft up next at 148 hours 33 minutes, about 14 minutes from now. This is Apollo Control Houston.
This is Mission Control just a little more than half way through the 94th revolution. The spacecraft is coming up on the tracking ship Mercury. We have been advised that the unified S band antenna at Mercury is down temporarily; they expect to have it back in operation within about an hour, but we will not have unified S band coverage over Mercury. However, that will be for a relatively short period of time and we move on across the Philippines and out toward Guam; we'll pick US band coverage from Guan. We'll stand by now for a call to the crew.
MERCURY (REV 94)
148:33:56 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through the Mercury. [Pause]
148:34:00 Schirra: Roger. Read you loud and clear. [Pause]
148:34:05 Swigert: Roger. Read you also. [Pause]
148:34:10 Schirra: [Garble] about 25 minutes [garble]. [Long pause]
148:34:23 Schirra: Hey, Jack.
148:34:24 Swigert: Go ahead, Wally.
148:34:26 Schirra: Okay. I guess we'll chlorinate water tonight, about 149:50. [Pause]
148:34:35 Swigert: Okay. Wally, you're about two-by here; you're pretty garbled. We might have a little better luck over Guam, which is coming up here. [Pause]
148:34:44 Schirra: Okay. We will chlorinate water today. [Long pause]
148:34:55 Swigert: Okay. We understand.
Comm break.
148:36:15 Schirra (onboard): [Garble] down about 52 [garble].
148:36:47 Schirra (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7.
Communications rather garbled there, using the VHF system in the absence of S band from the Mercury. Schirra advised that the crew would chlorinate the spacecraft water tonight, at least that's the way we copied it here, and we can expect communications to clear up somewhat as we move over Guam.
GUAM (REV 94)
148:37:56 Schirra: Hello, Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read?
148:37:59 Swigert: Roger. Go ahead, Apollo 7.
148:38:02 Schirra: Have you had a chance to work up our fuel status after today's operations? [Pause]
148:38:09 Swigert: Okay. Understand you want to get a present fuel status - fuel status now? [Pause]
148:38:15 Schirra: That's affirm; any time.
148:38:18 Swigert: Okay. We are summarizing that now; we'll probably have it up to you over Hawaii. [Pause]
148:38:22 Schirra: Very good. [Long pause]
148:38:35 Swigert: Apollo 7. Your fuel number for your onboard chart is 666. [Pause]
148:38:45 Schirra: Roger. Readback: 666.

Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We are about to lose contact with the spacecraft over Guam. During that pass Wally Schirra requested a status report on the service module RCS propellant quantity and was advised he has 666 pounds remaining. We'll pick up the spacecraft again over the Hawaiian tracking station. Acquisition is Scheduled there at 148 hours 51 minutes. At 148 hours 43 minutes this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 148 hours, 51 minutes. We have just acquired on the spacecraft and established contact; here is the conversation.
HAWAII through HUNTSVILLE (REV 94)
148:51:21 Swigert: Apollo 7. Houston through Hawaii.
148:51:24 Schirra: Loud and clear.
148:51:27 Swigert: Okay. Walt, I've got a little message for you here. [Pause]
148:51:33 Schirra: Walt's off COMM right now. Do you want me to rely, or should I get him up? [Pause]
148:51:40 Swigert: Okay. Wally, are you in the right seat? [Pause]
148:51:44 Schirra: Say again.
148:51:45 Swigert: Can you get in the right seat to do some readings of a couple of gages here? [Pause]
148:51:50 Schirra: Stand by. [Long pause]
148:52:04 Schirra: Go ahead.
148:52:05 Swigert: Okay. Wally, prior to this O2 fan tank - O2 tank 2 fan cycle that we are going to give you here, we would like to read out phase A, B, and C on AC bus 2. [Long pause]
148:52:25 Schirra: Roger. Phase A is 150.5, B 115.5, and C 115. [Long pause]
148:52:39 Swigert: Okay. Now, Wally, we would like to turn O2 fans tank 2 ON now, and then read out A, B, and C again. [Pause]
148:52:48 Schirra: Got the fans tank 2 ON now. Phase A is - went up just a smidgen - 116, B is about 115.7, and C is still 115. [Long pause]
148:53:09 Swigert: Okay. Wally, after 3 minutes of fan ON, we would like to have you be reading AC 2 phase B when you turn the fans OFF. [Long pause]
148:53:22 Schirra: Prior to, or subsequent?
148:53:24 Swigert: Right during the switch operation, when you turn the fans in tank 2 OFF, be reading phase B. [Pause]
148:53:31 Schirra: Okay. I'd say that's a pretty good job of sacking out that AC 1, AC 2 problem, anyway. [Long pause]
148:53:48 Swigert: I didn't copy that, Wally.
148:53:49 Schirra: That's a good job down there of sacking out that AC bus 1, AC bus 2 problem. [Pause]
148:53:54 Swigert: Roger. Thank you.
148:53:56 Schirra: I was kind of a crank when it first happened.
148:53:59 Swigert: I don't blame you a bit.
148:54:02 Schirra: I like to feel direct - direct coming home.
Comm break.
148:55:05 Schirra: Hey, Jack, you with me?
148:55:07 Swigert: Roger, Wally. Go ahead.
148:55:08 Schirra: Would you ask someone in the support room how many frames per foot there are in the 16mm camera? [Pause]
148:55:18 Swigert: Okay. We'll get it.
148:55:21 Schirra: Thank you. [Long pause]
148:56:10 Swigert: Hey, Jack, do you read?
148:56:11 Swigert: Go ahead.
148:56:13 Schirra: Okay. We just ran the switch valve test, and Walt looked at the phasing light on the switch; it dropped a smidgen - may be a quarter of a volt to half a volt. [Long pause]
148:56:24 Swigert: Okay. Thank you very much, Wally. I have some RCS redline data for you. [Pause]
148:56:31 Schirra: Stand by. [Pause]
148:56:40 Schirra: Go ahead.
148:56:41 Swigert: Okay. For service module - for an SCS service module RCS deorbit, the value is 581. [Long pause]
148:56:55 Schirra: Roger.
148:56:56 Swigert: Okay. For adapt RCS deorbit, the value is 520; and the value for hybrid deorbit, the value is 223. [Long pause]
148:57:14 Schirra: Roger.
148:57:15 Swigert: Okay. We show quad A is just a smidgen under the SCS redline but has ample margin for adapt deorbit. [Long pause]
148:57:27 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
148:57:31 Schirra: Jack, on these landmark sightings that you call up to us for targets of opportunity... [Pause]
148:57:39 Swigert: Roger.
148:57:40 Schirra: ... if you all could keep book on that - we missed Luzon this last pass; we might have had a whack at it. It's kind of hard to remember all those [garble]. [Long pause]
148:57:52 Swigert: Okay. You are a little bit hard to read. We'll pick it up on the recorder here. [Pause]
148:57:58 Schirra: On the landmark passes?
148:58:00 Swigert: Yes. Go ahead.
148:58:02 Schirra: If you can give us the time when they come up, whenver, that helps us quite a bit because we can write it on the flight plan. [Pause]
148:58:09 Swigert: Okay. Real fine. After we hand over to Huntsville - to - we get through to Huntsville here, we are going to hand over to ARIA so you might turn up your S-band volume. In a couple of minutes, we'll have ARIA coverage on S-band for about another 4 or 5 minutes. [Long pause]
148:58:27 Schirra: Very good. That was a good watch today, Jack. [Pause]
148:58:31 Swigert: It's been a good day; we've done a lot. [Pause]
148:58:35 Schirra: We sure did. [Pause]
148:58:39 Swigert: We're looking forward to tomorrow.
148:58:41 Schirra: Real fine. [Long pause]
148:59:38 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
148:59:41 Schirra: Go ahead.
148:59:42 Swigert: Okay. Wally, on that question that you asked: the 16 camera frame, there are 40 frames per foot of film. [Long pause]
148:59:58 Schirra: How many feet do we have in each magazine? [Pause]
149:00:02 Swigert: I didn't copy that last little, Wally. [Pause]
149:00:06 Schirra: How much footage do we have in the magazine? [Pause]
149:00:11 Swigert: Okay. Standby. [Long pause]
149:00:27 Swigert: Wally, there are 130 feet per magazine. [Pause]

150:07:24 Schirra: How's it going down there?
150:07:26 Evans: Real fine; beautiful day down here today.
150:07:29 Cunningham: We got some beautiful pictures of it.
150:07:32 Evans: Very good. [Pause]
150:07:36 Cunningham: You guys getting tired of this long flight or anything? [Pause]
150:07:41 Evans: No, not realy. I'd like to be there with you.
150:07:44 Schirra: We got room.
150:07:46 Evans: Good.
150:07:47 Schirra: That hurricane was realy something to see. It stood out very clearly today. [Long pause]
150:08:34 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston.
150:08:37 Schirra: Go.
150:08:38 Evans: Hoger. We concur on negative TV tmorrow.
150:08:41 Cunningham: Very good. [Long pause]
150:09:13 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Looks like pins have come undone again on LMP's BIOMED harness somewhere in there. [Pause]
150:09:23 Schirra: Okay. Roger. We'll get it glued together.
150:09:25 Evans: Roger.
150:09:26 Cunningham: Okay. Ron, I'll get on it. The reason for that is because I've got kind of a spider's web of leads down here. Even after they made this harness over, I've got about 6 inches extra on one lead, and a couple others are apparently pretty tight, I guess. [Long pause]
150:09:43 Evans: Roger. I understand. [Pause]
150:09:53 Cunningham: But I've got this ground wire on, so whatever you do comes through good, doesn't it? [Long pause]
150:10:05 Evans: It was real good for a long time there, Walt; then last night, we noticed that it looked like maybe the ground lead was possibly coming partially loose or something like that. [Long pause]
150:10:18 Evans: The sensor, that is.
150:10:20 Cunningham: Okay. I'll take a look at it. [Long pause]
150:10:55 Evans: I've got a one-line update to your targets of opportunity for two balls 5; that's two balls 5. [Pause]
150:11:02 Schirra: Go.
150:11:03 Evans: Roger. It's the area north of the Colorado River. [Pause]
150:11:09 Cunningham: North of the Colorado River? Seriously? [Pause]
150:11:14 Evans: Roger. Evidently it must be in the mountains up in there cause the river runs - [Pause]
150:11:18 Schirra: Colorado River runs north and south. That sounds like Alaska. [Pause]
150:11:22 Evans: Me, too. [Long pause]
150:11:37 Schirra: Ron, we're trying to figure out, just for the fun of it, what does burn 5 do to our inclination? Does anybody have a story on that handy? It's no big deal, just curious. [Pause]
150:11:41 Evans: Roger. Will check into it; I've got the - [Long pause]
150:12:04 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Long pause]
150:12:35 Schirra: Ron, while I'm looking at it, do you have any typhoons in the Far East, or [garble] in the Phillipines? [Long pause]
150:12:48 Evans: I'll check on it. I don't recall seeing any on the map there this evening. [Pause]
150:12:52 Schirra: Hawaii and Australua, wooly woolies? [Long pause]
150:13:37 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. About 1 minute to LOS.
150:13:40 Schirra: Roger.
150:13:41 Evans: Now, your preburn inclination is 31.22 and postburn 30.08; GETI will be about 165 plus 00. [Long pause]
150:13:58 Schirra: We thought we'd drive it in a little bit. Okay. [Pause]
150:14:03 Evans: And DELTA-V 1646, burn about a minute and 6 seconds. [Long pause]
150:14:18 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
150:14:23 Schirra: North of the Colorado River we won't get to for awhile.
150:14:26 Evans: Yes. That's right.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, 150 hours and 21 minutes. That's the end of the tape through the Mercury pass. As you heard the flight director has concurred with the crew's recommendation that there'll be no TV tomorrow because of the activity in the flight plan associated with this long number five SPS burn. The crew reported good pictures of our good weather down here. Lunar Module Pilot is having biomed harness problems again but he is repairing that now. There's was good com on this pass in which they discussed that burn. I'll go over those figures for you again though. These are the best numbers available at this time, we are looking for the burn at about 165 hours elapsed time. Duration of the burn one minute, six seconds, Delta V at 160046 feet per second. We'll-change the inclination of the orbit from 31.22 to 30.08 and we're predicting the orbital perameters post burn to be an apogee of 241 miles, perigee of 89.6 miles. Present apogee is 152.1, perigee 89.7, those are nautical miles, we're showing an orbital weight of Apollo 7 at the present time of 29538 pounds. Hawaii will acquire the spacecraft in about a minute, we'll come back up then.
This is Apollo Control at 150 hours 24 minutes. Hawaii has acquired now and we'll stand by.

150:26:04 Evans: That's correct. [Pause]
150:26:13 Evans: 7, Houston. We've got a new update on the amount of film in your magazines. [Pause]
150:26:19 Evans: You have 80 feet in 16 mm, magazines. [Pause]
150:26:25 Schirra: Fabulous. Oh, 80 feet rather than 130; that's not fabulous. Okay. [Pause]
150:26:30 Evans: Yes, that's right.
150:26:32 Schirra: Okay. I'll have to do my arithmetic over again then. I guess you can save us by telling us how long we can run it, 1 frame, 6 frames, and 16. [Long pause]
150:26:44 Evans: Roger. I'll get that information.
150:26:46 Schirra: Okay. [Pause]
150:26:50 Schirra: We mapped the whole southwest corner of the United States with 1 frame a second on an 18 mm lens today. [Pause]
150:26:59 Evans: Okay.

This is Apollo control at 151 hours 47 minutes, the Mercury has LOS. Brief transmission during this pass, Wally Schirra gave some film reports, indicating that he had done some photography over Japan including Mount Fujiyama. We told the lunar module pilot, Walt Cunningham, that we still are - still are unable to get a reading on his biomed, he believes that he's done all he can to fix the harness, but we'll continue to pursue that problem. The next station to acquire will be Hawaii at 151 hours 58 minutes.

152:01:49 Cunningham: Say again?
152:01:50 Evans: Roger. We coluld use a kind of a taste versus time from chlorination on the potable water. [Pause]
152:02:00 Cunningham: Well, now you've brought the subject up - you Want to talk to him? [Pause]
152:02:04 Schirra: We just put the chlorine in about 15 minutes ago, just before your pass. We are a little concerned about the rate to put it in. It's a rather brown-looking goopy thing at the base of the chlorine injector, and I'm not sure - rust or what - but I'm not sure that I'm happy with it at this time. [Long pause]
152:02:40 Evans: Roger. Houston. You went through a keyhole there, and we're still in one, really. At the base of what? And - [Long pause]

This is Apollo Control 152 hours, 4 minutes. Hawaii has LOS. During this pass Walt Cunningham reported that the environmental control system redundant component check had been completed satisfactorily. We ask the crew to give us a taste versus time report on the water chlorination and at that time Wally Schirra indicated that the - from what we could copy apparently the water is getting a brown tinge to it that they are not quite pleased with. We attempt to see if we can read that a little bit better on some tape. Next station to acquire will be the Redstone at 152 hours, 14 minutes. This is Mission Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control 152 hours 07 minutes. We have a better handle now on that last report. Wally Schirra reports quote: brown goopy stuff at the base of the chlorine injector. It is not in the water. At the base of the chlorine injector. This is Mission Control Houston.

This is Apollo Control 152 hours 19 minutes into the mission. The Redstone has LOS now. Apollo 7 nearing the end of its 96th revolution. During this pass the crew reported seeing a smoke trail of a ship, and remarked that should make Gordon Cooper happy, is a reference to Col. Cooperts Mercury flight, in which he reported seeing smoke at various locations, from ships and trains, and drew some disbelief from people that this was possible. The next station to acquire will be Ascension. 152 hours 40 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo control, 152 hours 40 minutes, Ascension has acquired Apollo 7, very low elevation pass nine tenths of a degree, this will be about a two and a half minute pass.

152:44:32 Cunningham: Had we not what?
152:44:34 Evans: Had you not taken the flight.

Very long comm break.
This is Apollo control 152 hours 44 minutes, Ascension has LOS now and the Mercury will acquire at 153 hours 15 minutes.
This is Apollo Control at 152 hours 47 minutes. We had a brief bit of additional conversation at Ascension after the normal LOS time. The network reports that we went past the predicted LOS by almost a minute. Since the tracking station there is on a hill over 2000 feet high and apparently they can track down past zero degrees which gave us that extra time. There was about 20 or 30 seconds of additional conversation, and we have a tape of that for you now.

153:18:22 Cunningham: Roger. Hey, Ron, tell the doctors not to worry about the cold. I always understood that it takes a week to get rid of it if you treat it and 7 days if you don't. Tomorrow's our eighth day, so it'll probably be gone. [Long pause]

Another thing for our future flight planing here on your procedures book in the control modes, if you could somehow give us a rundown: either number them down the page or some thing like that, and give me the numbers you have not completed, so we can kind of plan maybe on RCS fuel. [Long pause]

This is Apollo Control 155 hours 54 minutes. Ascension has LOS. Apollo 7 about 10 minutes away from sunrise on this rev. Next station to acquire will be the tracking ship Mercury, at 156 hours 22 minutes. The Mercury is experiencing heavy seas and may have some trouble tracking with its antenna. These heavy seas caused by tropical storm, Gloria in that area. This is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 156 hours and 22. minutes and Apollo 7 is approaching acquisition at the Mercury. Guam has overlapping coverage on this rev.

This is Apollo Control 158 hours 36 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We are losing acquisition at the Redstone tracking ship. During this pass we had a flight plan update for the next several hours through the fifth service propulsion system burn. The change in that burn is that it will be 66 seconds in duration instead of 60.9 seconds according to the flight plan. Flight plan also had a Delta V or velocity change of 1465.4 feet-per-second now it's indicated that the Delta V velocity change will be 1646. The burn will take place at 165 hours into the mission. We are ending up our 100th revolution of the Earth at 158 hours 37 minutes, this is Apollo Control.

160:02:44 Eisele: Yes, that's a good idea. Thanks, Bill. [Pause]
160:02:48 Pogue: And go ahead and do it anytime, I suppose.

160:02:51 Pogue: Also, when I was updating the flight plan - if you have it there, you'll notice there's still an "H2 heaters an" at 160 hours and 5 minutes and, of course, I should have had that deleted. [Long pause]
160:03:04 Eisele: Roger. I got that.
160:03:07 Pogue: And, one additional item to catch up on, and that's this fuel cell O2 purge at 163 40. This should be done after the DELTA-V bias test. [Long pause]

160:04:55 Eisele: I'm wondering - if we follow the procedure that's outlined, if we're not going to put ourselves in that undesirable situation where we're pointed straight up, or nearly so, in the lower part of our trajectory - and I'm wondering if it might not be better to simply specify the time in which they want the roll rate - you know, with the three disks to begin - and let us simply get them a few minutes ahead and then C spelling pitch and yaw at the designated time. [Long pause]
160:05:27 Pogue: Okay. Donn, stand by, and we'll bet that -
160:05:28 Eisele: - their tight net band for - oh, about 20 minutes before we disable pitch and yaw, and our experience so far indicates that we can do a better job mannually in pulse of nulling these pitch and yaw rates anyway. [Long pause]
160:05:48 Pogue: Roger. We've copied that, and we'll take a good look at that. [Pause]
160:05:52 Eisele: Okay. I'm afraid if we do it the way it's outlined, it may cost us a fair amount of fuel, and it may screw up the test as well. [Long pause]

161:37:30 Eisele: Roger, Bill. [Pause]
161:37:35 Pogue: Roger. I'd like to clarify one item in the comments regarding the bias: the manual cut-off at DELTA-V counter equalled 100 feet per second. I read it as one-zero-zero and just wanted to make sure that you understood there's not a decimal point there. [Long pause]
161:38:08 Eisele: Roger. I get you. You've deliberately loaded in a bigger number, and we cut off at a plus number manually by throwing the switch down, right? [Pause]
161:38:15 Pogue: That's affirmative, but it's 100 and not 10. [Pause]
161:38:20 Eisele: Right. I've got you.
161:38:22 Pogue: Also, You did get the R, P, and Y align? [Pause]
161:38:28 Eisele: Roger. I'll get that a little later. I'm right in the midst of an alignment here.
161:38:31 Pogue: Okay. Sory to have bothered you.
161:38:33 Eisele: No sweat. I plan to align this thing without mapping out the range, and boy, it's really wheeling around.

161:52:37 Eisele: Roger, Houston, Apollo 7. [Long pause]
161:52:50 Eisele: Bill, shortly after I left you and even while we were talking there, I [garble] the P51 and then do the P30 targeting - P40 and got a P52 alignment. I'd like to go through that at least one more time on a subsequent night pass, but as of right now, we're in pretty good shape on alignments. [Long pause]
161:53:10 Pogue: Wal, I got the word that they took a look at the numbers over Redstone, and they looked very favorable. [Pause]
161:53:17 Eisele: You mean the numbers in the computer?
161:53:18 Pogue: Roger.
161:53:20 Eisele: Very good.
161:53:21 Pogue: Also, I would like to check one thing if you'll get the maneuver PAD. [Pause]
161:53:27 Eisele: Got it right here.
161:53:28 Pogue: Roger. The trunnion - trunnion is 201. [Long pause]
161:53:50 Eisele: [Garble] too, did you not?
161:53:52 Pogue: You read it back. I'm pretty sure you read it correctly; I just wanted to confirm. It sounded - I wasn't too sure about the first number, and so that's about two-thirds of the way down the PAD there, 201 for the trunnion. [Long pause]
161:54:07 Eisele: Oh, yes. [Garble] star alignments. [Pause]
161:54:12 Pogue: Would you say that agAin, please?
161:54:15 Eisele: [Garble] backup alignment numbers - that was [garble]. [Pause]
161:54:19 Pogue: Oh, yes. Well, I just sent those up because this was an important burn, and it was 171, 260, and 04_ for the roll, pitch, and yaw align. [Long pause]
161:54:34 Eisele: Okay. Thank you. In case [garble] or something, I might have to use those at the last minute; I don't think it will happen, but ... [Pause]
161:54:42 Pogue: Okay.
161:54:44 Eisele: What I got to watch out for now is the fact we're lined up out of plane and this thing like to fly inplane. [Pause]

You're probably coming out of nighttime now, and to keep from having to give this to you over Carnarvon - you'll be coming up on nighttime pass - I'd like to get that to you as soon as possible, and then leave you free to use as much off the nighttime as possible on the next nighttime pass. [Long pause]
161:57:32 Eisele: Good thinking, I'll get the block data out. [Long pause]
161:58:25 Eisele: Go ahead with your block, Bill.

162:07:33 Pogue: Go.
162:07:36 Eisele: I think you need to give us a little advice along the way on these RCS quads. I'm going to switch them. I've already switched C, and I suspect A is getting down in that direction, perhaps B and D also. [Long pause]
162:07:48 Pogue: Roger. Stand by.
162:07:50 Eisele: I don't want to switch them until we have to, but I'd like you to help out.
162:07:53 Pogue: Okay.
Comm break.
162:09:13 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. You're riding comfortable above on Bravo and Delta. You're getting fairly close to A, about 5 to 6 pounds above, and we'll keep you advised on that just like we did on Charlie quad. [Long pause]
162:09:28 Eisele: Roger. Thank you. [Pause]
162:09:38 Pogue: Roger. And you might check attitude again there. [Pause]
162:09:43 Eisele: Roger. It's getting close.

162:12:48 Pogue: Go.
162:12:50 Eisele: Roger. Bill, could you find out exactly how many frames we have in this big set camera pack? Nominal numberr is something like 165. We appear to have more than that. I just wondered if anybody down there knows exactly how many. [Long pause]
162:13:06 Pogue: I'll check. I'll try and get the word to you, but we're coming up on LOS. [Pause]
162:13:10 Eisele: Well, whatever is convenient; no rash on it. [Pause]

This is Apollo Control, 162 hours, 13 minutes into the mission. We've just had lost of signal at Canary Islands. Our next point of contact will be Canarvon at 162 hours, 40 minutes. During this pass, CapCom Pogue here in the Control center indicated to astronaut Eisele in the spacecraft that the S-IVB stage of the Saturn booster was ahead of the command and service module off the coast of Africa at about 400,000 feet. The S-IVB is due to reenter at approximately 166 hours into the mission. Eisele made the comment that as near as we could hear - Adios, Big Brute. Eisele is keeping watch on the spacecraft attitude and he says he will try and not fire any thrusters to keep it - to keep it within limits. At 162 hours, 15 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 162 hours 40 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We're now coming up on Carnarvon tracking station and our 103rd revolution. We should have acquisit$on in a very few seconds, let's join in.

162:40:40 Eisele: Roger. Houston, this is Apollo 7.
162:40:43 Pogue: Roger. Say, in reference to the passive thermal control test: we would still like to perform the test as per the procedure. A couple of points of clarification: the time of initiation is selected to get MAX time above 200 miles with channels disabled; also, the time to initiate attitude hold is 10 minutes past perigee so we shouldn't have too much of a problem there on the drag. [Long pause]
162:41:22 Eisele: Okay. If you say so. We'll give it a whirl; if it's too bad, we'll probably have to modify a little bit going up. [Pause]
162:41:30 Pogue: Okay. And. in that regard, there'll be two more of those tests, and they say if this is too expensive in fuel that we can just take a look at one of the two other tests that are coming up. We may just scrub one of those. [Long pause]
162:41:51 Eisele: But I'm strongly suggest that if we get good results out of the first one. [Pause]
162:41:55 Pogue: Well, they don't anticipate too much of a problem, but we'll just adopt a wait-and-see attitude on that one. [Pause]
162:42:02 Eisele: Roger. Understand.
162:42:04 Pogue: Also, in reference to your question on the casette: I've checked into this, and there are 165 frames MAX in there, and I asked them if you kept cranking what happened. Apparently, it just keeps turning, so you're not tajking any more pictures after that. [Long pause]
162:42:22 Eisele: Oh, no, you've got to he kidding. Okay. Thank you for the dope. [Pause]
162:42:28 Pogue: Right. Also, just for your informations on your pass over the States after the burn, you will be visible over Houston. [Pause]
162:42:37 Eisele: Roger. Understand.
162:42:39 Pogue: Just before sunrise. [Long pause]
162:42:50 Pogue: I'm sorry, Donn; that's before the burn. [Pause]
162:42:55 Eisele: Roger. Understand. [Long pause]
162:43:20 Pogue: Say, Donn, how did the EMS DELTA-V test work out? [Pause]
162:43:25 Eisele: We haven't done that yet, Bill.
162:43:27 Pogue: Okay.
162:43:30 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7.
162:43:32 Pogue: Roger. Go.

162:49:49 Pogue: Roger. I've just been advised we're monitoring your condenser temperature on fuel cell number 2 at 174 degrees. This is 10 degrees higher than the other; there is a limit of 176 for alarm indication so you may get a light on that, but we are watcing it, and there is no cause for undue concern now. [Long pause]
162:50:15 Eisele: Roger. You say if it goes up to 176 not to sweat it.
162:50:18 Pogue: Roger. You get a light.
162:50:20 Eisele: Right. I know; but we don't have to get excited about that?
162:50:23 Pogue: Roger.

Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, 162 hours, 56 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We have just lost acquisition at Honeysuckle and we will be coming upon Guaymas, Mexico Tracking Station at 163 hours, 20 minutes, toward the end of the one hundred third revolution. During this pass we heard CapCom Pogue talk first of all about the camera onboard. The question Eisele had asked him of how many frames were in the camera. And Pogue indicated in this pass that there were 165 useable frames, total frames in the camera and after that it just kept clicking and there was no way to tell that there no some frames left. Eisele had a reply to that which was "Oh no, you gotta be kidding", which probably indicated that he did not realize that. Eisele indicated he just got a picuture of Canarvon and later indicated that he took three pictures of Carnarnon and terrain feature pictures of Austrailia. Pogue indicated that our ground readouts and the control center show the fuel cell number two condenser temperature at 174 degrees. He also indicated that if it went to 176 degrees, the alarm indication light will go on and not to sweat it. There was no reason for concern. In that fuel cell process, the hydrogen pump - provides a continuous circulation of hydrogern in primary loop. And it withdraws water vapor of and heet from the cell stacks. The - then the primary bypass valve regulates the flow through the hydrogen which is called the regenerator and takes exhaust heat to the incoming hydrogen gas as it is required to maintain the proper cell temperature. The exhaust gas flows to the condenser where the waste heats transfer to the glycol and the result temperature decrease liquifies some of the water vapor. It's this condenser that he was refering to when he indicated that it was now reading 174 degrees. At 162 hours, 59 minutes into the mission, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 163 hours 20 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We're now coning up on acquisition for Guaymas, Mexico, we should have it in a few seconds. The astronauts should all be up now and in an eating period, let's stand by for conversation.
GUAYMAS through ANTIGUA (REV 103)
163:20:57 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston through Guaymas.
163:20:58 Cunningham (onboard): I'd like to have ...
163:21:00 Cunningham: Roger, Houston. Good morning, Bill.
163:21:03 Pogue: Good morning; how are you today?
163:21:05 Cunningham: Not bad. Say, I wonder if you could give me a readout on my fuel cell radiator 2 inlet and outlet test, please. Give me the trend for the last several hours. [Pause]
163:21:15 Pogue: Roger. We're doing that very thing right now. [Pause]
163:21:21 Cunningham: We do have a partial warning light on, and it's reading about 177 or 178 on the condenser exhaust; the skip temperature has crept on up to about 435. [Long pause]
163:21:34 Pogue: Roger. Our last reading on the fuel cell was 174, and that was 48 over Carnarvon. [Long pause]
163:21:45 Cunningham: Roger. I'm wondering about - if we get that trend, I'm sure you think it's probably a cooler pump failure, also. The other question I have is should we give some thought, to open circuiting the fuel cell now and throwing it on, letting it cool down a bit, putting it on just before the burn? [Long pause]
163:22:02 Pogue: That's exactly our line of thinking; we'll get back to you on that just as soon as we take a closer look at the data here. [Pause]
163:22:11 Cunningham: Okay.
Long comm break.
GUAYMAS through ANTIGUA (REV 104)
163:26:18 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston.
163:26:21 Cunningham: Go ahead, Bill. [Long pause]
163:26:38 Cunningham: Go ahead, Bill.
163:26:40 Pogue: Roger. In regard to your first request, we're still working on the trend. I told them to go back about two orbits. We suggest you open circuit the fuel cell and put it back on line at 165 plus 45. That's 15 minutes prior to the burn. Two fuel cells can handle the loads; however, the bus voltage is going to be about 26.5 to 26.6. [Long pause]
163:26:58 Cunningham: Roger. I concur. Say again the time for putting them back on.
163:27:00 Pogue: At 164 plus 45; that's 15 minutes prior to the burn. [Pause]
163:27:09 Cunningham: Right. [Pause]
163:27:18 Cunningham: Got a morning report for you, Bill.
163:27:21 Pogue: Okay.
163:27:22 Cunningham: Partial pressure O2 still 245 mm of mercury, so it looks like it's holding there. I'll knock off giving you those reading any more; I might take one the last morning. LMP 15 clicks of water this morning. I had 6 and 1/2 hours, maybe 7 hours of sleep. CDR had 4 and 1/2 hours of good sleep last night.
163:27:50 Pogue: Roger. Understand. LMP 15 clicks of water, 6 and 1/2 to 7 hours of sleep, and the CDR 4 and 1/2 hours of good sleep. Also, Walt, you can turn the CRYO O2 tanks - tank fans off, tank 2 fans off.
163:28:08 Cunningham: They're off. Been off awhile.
163:28:10 Pogue: Thank you. [Pause]
163:28:16 Schirra: Good morning, Bill.
163:28:17 Pogue: Good morning, Wally. How's everything?
163:28:19 Schirra: Very good. Haven't heard you in awhile.
163:28:21 Pogue: No, I've been on the off period here, I guess. [Pause]
163:28:25 Schirra: Yes, they're trying to move us up earlier each day.
163:28:28 Pogue: Right.
163:28:30 Cunningham: Understand you're a big TV fan of ours.
163:28:33 Pogue: That's right. I've been running home from work just in time to watch. [Long pause]
163:28:56 Schirra: Thought for today we were going to try for an Emmy for the best weekly series� [Pause]
163:29:02 Pogue: I thought you were going to try for a Hammy.
163:29:03 Schirra: Emmy.
163:29:04 Pogue: Right.
163:29:05 Schirra: Oh, you're coming back. I lost it. That's one for you. [Pause]
163:29:10 Pogue: (laughing) That's a rare one. [Long pause]
163:29:41 Schirra: That makes up for the involuntary "Oh, Boy" you gave us, anyway.
163:29:44 Pogue: Roger. [Long pause]
163:30:32 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houstibon. At the risk of belaboring the point, we'd like to confirm O2 tank 2 fans OFF and heaters AUTO. [Long pause]
163:30:46 Cunningham: Fans are off and the - I have one heater here on. Was that called ON during the night? [Pause]
163:30:54 Pogue: Negative. That should be - [Pause]
163:30:58 Cunningham: Okay. The fan is off. [Pause]
163:31:04 Pogue: Okay. For O2 tank 2, the fans should be off and the heater in AUTO. [Pause]
163:31:09 Cunningham: Roger. Understand. I'm going to turn the fan ON for 5 minutes. I had it off here. Looks like we may have had a heater go inadvertently ON instead of AUTO. [Long pause]
163:31:22 Pogue: Okay.
Comm break.
163:33:06 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston.
163:33:09 Cunningham: Go Ahead, Bill.
163:33:10 Pogue: Roger. You might tell Donn apparently he's trying to load that NOUN 48 there and having trouble in register 2. He's putting in a minus 49; and when he's checking it, it's coming back a 50. They say that's because of scaling into and out from. [Long pause]
163:33:27 Eisele: Roger. I was having fun with that. If you put in a 49, it adds one; and if you put in a 48, it substracts one. There's no way to get 49 on there. [Pause]
163:33:37 Pogue: They say that when you put the 49 in and enter it, it's okay. [Pause]
163:33:43 Eisele: Yes, it's all right.
163:33:44 Pogue: Okay.
163:33:47 Eisele: I was just having fun with it. [Long pause]
163:34:09 Cunningham: Hey, Bill, notice how quickly our condenser exhaust temperature started coming dovn.
163:34:12 Pogue: Yes, it's coming right down. [Long pause]
163:34:55 Cunningham: Hey, Bill, I'm thinking of manually balancing the hydrogen tanks right after the burn. [Pause]
163:35:00 Pogue: Okay.
163:35:03 Cunningham: I'd like to have what you guys read out as quantites in H2 1 and H2 2. [Pause]
163:35:12 Pogue: Stand by. [Long pause]
Communications Technician (onboard): Try again.:163:35:30: [Pause]
163:35:38 Pogue: Walt, we're reading 42.6 in number - H2 number 1 and 39.2 in H2 number2. [Long pause]
163:35:49 Cunningham: Roger. I'll balance it after the burn. Tell Rita Rapp that ham and applesauce is a great dish. [Pause]
163:35:59 Pogue: Roger. Ham and applesauce. We're coming up on LOS; we'll have Canaries at 39. [Pause]
163:36:09 Schirra: As far as CDR's concerned, steak and eggs are better.
163:36:12 Pogue: Amen.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, 163 hours, 37 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We have 2 minutes, roughly, to wait before acquistion at the Canary Islands at 39 past the hour. During this pass we heard fuel cell number 2 condenser situation talked about. The suggestion from the spacecraft was to open the circuit now, cool it down, and put the fuel cell back on the line again just before the SPS number 5 burn on the next revolution. That was what they were instructed to do. To open she circuit and put it back on the line at 164 hours, 15 minutes into the mission which would be 15 minutes before the service propulsion system burn. It was also indicated that two fuel cells, however, can handle the loads involved. Cunningham indicated he had 15 clicks or 7 and 1/2 ounces of water. He had 6 and 1/2 to 7 hours of sleep. And that Schirra the spacecraft commander had had 4 and 1/2 hours of sleep. Cunningham indicated again that he understood that astronaut Pogue our CapCom here is a big TV fan of theirs. Schirra said that he would like to try for an Emmy for the best weekly series at which point astronaut Pogue here in the control center said you mean a Hammy. Cunningham indicated that ham and applesauce is a great dish. And Schirra said that steak and eggs are better for the CDR, meaning the spacecraft commander. We have 1 minute to wait for acquisition at Canary Islands. We will just stay on the line here and standby for conversation.
CANARY (REV 104)
163:39:48 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston through Canary.
163:39:51 Cunningham: Roger. Loud and clear, Bill.
163:39:53 Pogue: Roger. Have you done the EMS DELTA-V bias test yet? [Pause]
163:39:58 Schirra: Okay.
163:40:00 Pogue: And as soon as you have finished with that, we would like a fuel cell O2 purge on all three. [Pause]
163:40:07 Cunningham: Roger. I'm going to go ahead and do that now. [Pause]
163:40:11 Pogue: Well, we thought maybe that - no, I guess it wouldn't hurt anything. [Pause]
163:40:17 Pogue: Roger. [Long pause]
163:41:00 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. I have an update for the passive thermal control tests. However, if you are busy, we can hold off for awhile. [Pause]
163:41:09 Cunningham: Go ahead, Bill.
163:41:10 Pogue: Roger. Passive thermal control, T zero 166 plus 50, T align 167 plus 16, attitude is 000. And that's it. [Long pause]
163:41:35 Cunningham: Roger. T zero 166 050, T align 167 plus 16, roll zero, pitch zeros yaw zero. [Pause]
163:41:42 Pogue: Readback is correct. [Pause]
163:41:46 Schirra: Bill, did anybody take into consideration our perigee torquing on that alignment? [Pause]
163:41:53 Pogue: Yes, we had quite a discussion on that, Wally. And it turns out that - you spin this thing up about 10 minutes past perigee and go in attitude hold. They're willing to pay any penalty to get that thing set up for this so that you will be in the proper attitude at the proper roll rate as you go above 200 miles. If they use too much fuel on this, then they are willing to do away with one of the - or both of the other tests. [Long pause]
163:42:22 Schirra: Okay. Let's have all of the DTO guys get together in a huddle and add up their willingness to spend fuel and see if it meets our budget. [Long pause]
163:42:33 Pogue: Roger. Well, that's what we have already done, and they say they are willing to accept a cancellation of one or both of those later tests in order to get this done the way it is written out. [Long pause]
163:42:45 Schirra: Okay. That's fair enough. I think we all - it's a new thing to all of us up here, and I think we should be aware of it. [Pause]
163:42:53 Pogue: Roger.
163:42:54 Schirra: I'm not complaining or anything there. It's a phenomenon that's going to hurt us every time. I'm explaining it right now, in fact. [Pause]
163:42:59 Pogue: Roger.
163:43:00 Schirra: I think I got advantage of it this time. It is driving me to the right attitude. [Pause]
163:43:06 Pogue: Good.
Comm break.
163:45:57 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up on LOS Canary. We may be able to get you at Tananarive at 01. Also, we would like the BIOME to CDR, and note we have lost CMP EKG; request check harness. [Long pause]
163:46:19 Cunningham: Lost CMP EKG. Roger. You notice that my main bus voltage, Bill, is runing right at 26 volts down here; it's going to trigger these lights on and off. [Long pause]
163:46:30 Pogue: Roger. I just checked on that a minute ago, and we were reading 26.9. Let me check again, here. 26.7 to 26.6 we're reading here, Walt. [Long pause]
163:46:42 Cunningham: Okay. Well, it triggered off the master alarm a little bit ago, and I'm reading right at 26 on the onboard meter. [Pause]
163:46:47 Pogue: Thank you very much. [Long pause]
163:47:03 Schirra: Bill, what about the change of coolant pump?

This is Apollo Control, 163 hours, 47 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We have just lost acquisition at the Canary Islands and we are looking for Apollo 7 at 164 hours, 1 minute at Tananarive. At Carnarvon we are looking for it at 164 hours, 14 ninutes. At 163:47 this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 164 hours 01 minute into the mission of Apollo 7. We are coming up on a pass, a very short pass, a 2 minute pass at Tananarive, We should have acquisition in a very few seconds. Let's stand by.

Very long comm break.
164:03:46 Schirra (onboard): Roger. We're just now over Tananarive, and loud and clear.
164:03:54 Cunningham (onboard): Houston - Houston, do you read Apollo 7?
This is Apollo Control 164 hours 03 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We just had a voice check and that was all at Tananarive. We are standing by for Carnarvon, which will be 164 hours 14 minutes. At 164:03, this is-Apollo Control." [Long pause]
164:04:46 Cunningham (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7.
This is Apollo Control 164 hours 14 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We are on our 104th revolution, approaching Carnarvon acquisition, approaching Australia. After this Carnarvon and Honeysuckle pass, we will have an update of the past 8 hours of activity, or 7 and 1/2 hours of activity. Now let's join the conversation.
CARNARVON (REV 104)
164:14:26 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
164:14:32 Schirra: Roger. Loud and clear. The EMS bias test for the duration of the burn plus 30 seconds, which is when we turn it on, is 0.3 feet per second. [Pause]
164:14:42 Pogue: Roger. 0.3. [Pause]
164:14:46 Schirra: That's a minute and 36 seconds. [Long pause]
164:14:57 Schirra: Bill, I would like to have you go over again what you have proposed for the DELTA-V counter setting on this burn. [Pause]
164:15:07 Pogue: Okay. The DELTA-V counter setting will be 1728.0. What this does - it is 100 feet higher than the DELTA-V that you want to get, and you will turn the thrust switches off at 100.0 indication on the DELTA-VC counter, in other words, with a hundred feet remaining. [Long pause]
164:15:35 Schirra: What is the reasoning behind that? The thing is built to turn itself off at zero. That's one of our primary checks on the SCS cutoff on the DELTA-V counter. [Long pause]
164:15:46 Schirra: I'll turn it off if it doesn't turn itself off at zero. This is a complete departure from the way we normally use the DELTA-V counter and the SCS technique. [Long pause]
164:15:59 Pogue: Roger. That is correct. However, the DTO calls for this as part of the test. I think it's in that little burn sheet on the inside cover of the flight plan. [Long pause]
164:16:10 Schirra: The DTO is wrong, then. [Pause]
164:16:19 Schirra: The DELTA-V cutoff in the DTO, as I see it - we've looked at it - says cutoff through thrust switches. I don't think enough people understand the EMS. I found that out as soon as we got it on board. [Long pause]
164:16:40 Pogue: Walt, are you there? [Pause]
164:16:45 Cunningham: I'm here. [Pause]
164:16:49 Pogue: Roger. We need fuel cell number 2 back ON at 164 plus 30. That's 30 minutes prior to the burn, instead of the 15 that I gave you. [Pause]
164:16:57 Cunningham: Okay. I'll do that, but it looks to me like it's going to - that will give us just about enough time to get up the alarm stage again. Donn is still reading 170 about on the condenser exhaust and 430 on the skin. [Long pause]
164:17:11 Pogue: Let me see if I if get a compromise here.
164:17:14 Cunningham: Okay. I'll do - I'll go with whatever you guys want, but I would like to make sure we aren't jumping the gun. Also, I would like to know what your trim data shows on those radiators, so I will know whether to turn the pumps off or not. [Pause]
164:17:24 Pogue: Roger. Stand by. I've asked for that. It's still in process. [Long pause]
164:17:39 Cunningham: Okay. Standing by. [Long pause]
164:17:52 Schirra: Bill, do you understand the normal cutoff at a DELTA-V? That's what it's for. It will beat me any time. [Pause]
164:17:58 Pogue: Roger. I understand that. In fact, the way I had understood this was that you were using the thrust switches to turn it OFF just to check them. It's part of a ... [Pause]
164:18:07 Schirra: They better work; that's all we've got. They got three modes of cutoffs: G&N cutoff, DELTA-V counter going through zero, and then DELTA-V thrust switches. And I'm convinced that they must work, or I wouldn't be up here. [Long pause]
164:18:23 Pogue: Right. This was a late change, Wally, and you have a 100 foot per second there to play with, so to speak. If they don't cut if off, then the DELTA-V will cut it off. [Long pause]
164:18:34 Schirra: Roger. That's a late change to everything then; that is not the way we've been doing burn 5. And it says nothing about biasing the DELTA-V counter 100 feet per seccud. We've never done it. I'm hair-triggered for zero. [Long pause]
164:19:25 Schirra: Hey, Bill.
164:19:26 Pogue: Go.
164:19:28 Schirra: I guess you have raised somthing in my mind. We did have an SCS burn where the DELTA-V counter did cut off, didn't we? [Pause]
164:19:34 Pogue: Roger. That is affirmative.
164:19:35 Schirra: Okay. Let's bias it about, say 50 fleet. I don't want to throw another 100 fleet per second on this beauty. [Long pause]
164:20:10 Pogue: Wally, 50 feet bias - feet per second bias is okay. [Pause]
164:20:14 Schirra: Okay. [Long pause]
164:20:55 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Carnarvon; Honeysuckle at 22; S-band volume up. [Long pause]

164:23:08 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houstca through Honeysuckle. [Pause]
164:23:12 Schirra: Loud and clear.
164:23:14 Pogue: Roger. Did you get my call to check the O2 tank 2 fans? We are monitoring them still ON. [Pause]
164:23:20 Cunningham: I did, and I think you'll find them OFF now.
164:23:22 Pogue: Roger. [Long pause]
164:24:00 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Subsequent to our conversation on this DELTA-V setting, I just want to confirm that the setting will now be 1678.8. [Long pause]
164:24:14 Schirra: Roger. We'll set it now.
164:24:15 Pogue: Thank you.

164:26:23 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. A few minutes ago, you gave me the drift for the EMS DELTA-V bias test as 0.3 and 1 plus 36 seconds. I just wonder if I could get a readout of residuals from the EMS DELTA-V test. [Long pause]

164:27:17 Cunningham: The fuel cell condenser - looking at the condenser exhaust temperature of fuel cell 1 now, and the skin temperature, also. [Long pause]
164:27:31 Cunningham: But I do have fuel cell 2 back on the limes.
164:27:34 Pogue: Roger. Thank you. [Pause]
164:27:40 Cunningham (onboard): [Garble]. Can you read me, Jack?
164:28:05 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Request a readout on the residuals from the EMS DELTA-V test. [Pause]
164:28:13 Schirra: I ran the EMS DELTA - DELTA-V test is minus 21.7. [Pause]
164:28:18 Pogue: 21.7. Thank you. [Pause]
164:28:22 Cunningham: Hey, Bill, fUel cell 1 has got a skin temperature of about - between 435 and 440, and the condenser exhaust temperature is 178, it looks like now. [Long pause]
164:28:37 Pogue: Roger. We are reading slightly lower tken that, but we are watching it. [Pause]
164:28:42 Cunningham: Okay. It seems to start coming down after I put two on the line, but I can't figure it out in regard to condenser exhaust temperature. [Pause]
164:28:50 Pogue: We are studying the problem, too. [Pause]
164:28:57 Pogue: Okay. We show number 1 coming, starting to come down slightly. We're about 1 minute from LOS Honeysuckle; Guaymas at 51 - excuse me, Huntswille at 47.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 164 hours, 29 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We have lost acquisition at Honeysuckle. We are anticipating contact with the Huntsville ship at 164:47. For a recap of the last, roughly 7-1/2 hours of the mission, from 157 hours through 161 hours, it was relatively quiet. At 160 hours, Donn Eisele reported he had taken 12 clicks, or 6 ounces of water. At that time, he was dumping the waste water. He was at 53 percent on the dump and bringing it down to 25 percent. At 161 hours into the mission, CapCom Pogue here at the Control Center, sent up the information to Eisele that Apollo 7 had a go for 121 dash 1, which means 120 revolutions. At 162 hours into the mission the Canary Island tracking station acquisition Pogue told Apollo 7 that the S-IVB stage, the Saturn stage, was ahead of the command and service module off the coast of Africa at about 400, 000 feet. That S-IVB stage is due to reenter at approximately 166 hours into the mission. Eisele's comment at that time was, "Adios Big Brute". Eisele at that time was keeping a watch on the spacecraft's attitude trying not to fire any thrusters to keep it within limits. At 162 hours 40 minutes over Carnarvon it was indicated that 165 frames were the maximum number of frames in the camera. Eisele had asked that question of the ground before, and after that it just keeps turning and there is no indication that there is no more film available. Eisele's comment there was, "Oh no, you've got to be kidding." Eisele then indicated that he had gotten three pictures of Carnarvon and terrain features of Australia. At that time CapCom Pogue indicated that our ground readouts here showed that the fuel cell number 02 condenser temperature was 174 degrees F and that if it went to 176 degrees F the alarm indication light would go on and not to sweat it because there was no reason for concern and we were watching it here on the ground. That condenser, the way it works on the fuel cell is the hydrogen pump provides a continuous circulation of hydrogen in the primary loop of the fuel cell, and it takes water vapor and heat from the spec - from the fuel cells - and through a series of bypass valves it regulates the flow through the hydrogen, what's called a regenerator, and through that to impart exhaust heat to the incoming hydrogen gas which of course is cryogenic, as that is required to maintain the proper temperature in the cell. Then the exhaust gas flows to the condenser, which is the thing in question, where the waste heat is transferred to the glycol and the resultant temperature decrease liquifies some of the water vapor. Well, this is the condenser that is in question as far as the temperature was concerned at that time. At 163 hours 20 minutes into the mission at Guaymas, Cunningham indicated, who was then awake, that fuel cell number 02 condenser the light had gone on, it was now an open circuit, and we are going to cool it down and put it on again. That was also according to ground instructions just before the SPS burn which was scheduled to occur at 165 hours into the mission. Cunningham indicated that he had taken 15 clicks or 7 and a half ounces of water and he had had 6 and a half to 7 hours of good sleep, and that the spacecraft commander, Schirra, had had 4 and a half hours of sleep. He also indicated he understood Pogue, the CapCom was a big TV fan of theirs, and Schirra chimed in about the TV that he would like to try for an Emmy for the best weekly series. Pogue replied, "You mean a Hammy." We have had during the pass at Carnarvon further comment concerning fuel cell number 02 and the fact that Pogue indicated it should go on the line at 164 hours into the mission. Cunningham indicated that possibly we might get a warning light again if we put it on that soon, that if we waited till 164 hours, 45 minutes or 15 minutes before the service propulsion system burn, that it might be better. However, at 164 hours 29 minutes fuel cell number 02 was put back on the line. The fuel cell number 01 then was indicating by an onboard reading by Cunningham that it was 178 degrees, and the condenser reading - and Pogue the CapCom, indicated that it was coming down, that we had a light reading on the ground - that it was coming down. At 165 hours into the mission we will go in for a fifth service propulsion system burn. It will be a performance test of the service propulsion system or engine, and it will be a propellant utilization and engaging system test, and also a control mode changeover test. The control mode changeover will be initiated under the guidance and navigation control mode first when the start the burn, and the last 30 seconds of the burn it will change over to a mode where the pilot onboard, Schirra, will control it with the hand controller. The resulting DELTA-V, or change in velocity, will be approximately 1646 feet per second. This will be the longest burn of the mission for the service propulsion system. It will be preceded by a 20 second ullage burn, and the total SPS burn will be 66 seconds long. In the flight plan the burn originally had been scheduled for 61.5 seconds for a change in velocity of 1465 feet per second. The resulting orbital change will put the spacecraft at an apogee of 240.6 miles, and perigee or low point of 89.8 miles. As I say, this manuever will occur at 165 hours into the mission, which is 6 days 21 hours, that will at 7:00 Central time this morning. Our spacecraft sighting table indicates that for the 18th of october, this morning, the command and service modules, providing the skies are clear, could be viewed from Houston, Texas here, and it could be viewed approaching from the west southwest at 6:54 A.M., some 10 minutes from now, or a little more. Maximum elevation would be 38 degrees due south at 6:59 A.M. and it will leave going east at 7:02 A.M. There will be no TV scheduled for today and again the S-IVB stage of the Saturn rocket vehicle should reenter at 166 hours ground elapsed time. At 164:40 this is Apollo Control.
164:44:30 Schirra (onboard): The time is 164 hours and 45 minutes. We are now in DAP control, NAV DEADBAND, 0.02-degree-per-second rate, and we are letting the DAP turn the spacecraft to the burn attitude. And then we are holding there.
This is Apollo Control, 164 hours, 47 minutes into the flight of Apollo 7, We are coming up now on the tracking ship Huntsville, and after that we have simultaneous acquisition almost by Guaymas and we'll go into a Stateside pass and we'll be live through that pass and during that pass we should have our 5th service propulsion system engine burn. Let's stand by.

164:50:36 Cunningham: Right.
164:50:39 Pogue: You have about 1 minute and -
164:50:40 Cunningham: On the alignment - this was a couple of hours ago - on the initial alignment, the gyro torquing angles were 1 degree, 2 degrees, and 3 and 1/2 degrees, respectively. [Long pause]
164:50:51 Pogue: Roger. One degree. 2 degrees, and 3 and 1/2 degrees. [Pause]
164:50:55 Cunningham: Right. That was after the coarse align to the burn attitude. And at the fine align, torque angles were very small. [Pause]
164:51:01 Pogue: Roger. Fine align wery small. I have an advisory regarding the burn, relating to the fuel cell operation. Number 1: make the burn with three fuel cells on line, of course, if at all possible. Number 2: it's okay to make the burn with two fuel cells; it would cost less than 1 ampere hour on the batteries. Number 3: if the condenser temperature exceeds 200 degrees F, remove that fuel cell from line except during the burn. [Long pause]
164:51:42 Cunningham: Roger. [Pause]

This is Apollo Control. They are now securing the systems onboard. The SPS firing has completed. [Long pause]
165:02:04 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
165:02:06 Schirra: Roger. Our residuals are minus two balls 469 plus 00128 plus 0079; the DELTA-V counter is hardly visible due to the bright sunlight in the cabin at this time, even with the numerics still up, so we're having it cut off itself. [Long pause]
165:02:26 Pogue: Roger. Understand. It cut off on the DELTA-V counter. [Pause]
165:02:31 Cunningham: That's right.
165:02:32 Pogue: Thank you. [Long pause]
165:02:55 Cunningham: I'm reading 4.55 percent oxidtser left, and 3.8 percent fuel left on the SPS. [Pause]
165:03:05 Pogue: Roger.
165:03:06 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
165:03:07 Pogue: Go.
165:03:08 Schirra: That's your big mistake in changing the rules in real time. First off, we couldn't see the DELTA-V counter. [Pause]
165:03:16 Cunningham: Yes ...
165:03:17 Pogue: Roger. We read that; I think that the situation is rather obvious now.
165:03:20 Schirra: Okay. Let's then learn a big lessen from that. [Pause]
165:03:29 Schirra: If you recall, we simulated that burn without doing that DELTA-V game. [Pause]
165:03:34 Pogue: Roger. That Was a last mlnute change.
165:03:36 Schirra: That's correct; it didn't hurt us. [Pause]
165:03:41 Schirra: That's the reason we went along with it. [Pause]
165:03:47 Schirra: The DELTA-V counter residuals is minus 17.2. [Pause]
165:03:57 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. We have you in an 89 by 243. [Pause]
165:04:02 Cunningham: Roger.
165:04:03 Schirra: Roger. I had a chnnce to look at the accelerometer; it was just smidgen under 1 g. [Pause]
165:04:08 Pogue: Roger.
165:04:09 Schirra: Which was a nice little experience for this long a period.
165:04:12 Pogue: Right. [Pause]
165:04:17 Schirra: It didn't even twitch a little bit when we took over a real nice transition into SCS MPDC. [Pause]
165:04:25 Pogue: Roger. Copy.
165:04:26 Schirra: It took very minute control adjustments to keep it on. [Pause]
165:04:33 Pogue: Roger.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control; the results of that burn, you heard, at 89 by 243 nautical mile orbit we had aimed for 89.8 by 240.6, so that's pretty well on the money.
This is Apollo Control. There are several things to be gotten from this SPS burn. Some of the requirements were to analyze the inertial measuring unit performance, the entry monitoring system performance, the SPS performance, and some of these readouts of course we don't have at this time but it certainly looks good from here.
165:05:41 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
165:05:43 Pogue: Go.
165:05:46 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
165:05:48 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
165:05:49 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read? [Pause]
165:05:57 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read? [Long pause]
165:06:12 Pogue: Apollo 7, Apollo 7. Over. [Pause]
165:06:21 Pogue: Apollo 7, Apollo 7. How do you read? Over. [Pause]
165:06:25 Schirra: Roger. Read you loud and clear.
165:06:27 Pogue: Roger. We had to go to manual key.
165:06:30 Schirra: That was a real nice maneuver. The machine performed beautifully. [Pause]
165:06:34 Pogue: Good.
165:06:35 Schirra: [Garble] completed either one.
165:06:36 Pogue: Nice to hear. [Pause]
165:06:42 Schirra: We may be mopping up water; we'll check that a little later.
165:06:45 Pogue: Roger. That ought to have settled quite a bit out. [Pause]
165:06:52 Schirra: We are realigning to the DSKY ALIGN.
165:06:55 Pogue: Roger.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control. Spacecraft commander Schirra just indicated the machine performed beautifully. This of course must also refer to the manual thrust vector control or his controlling the SPS engine during the last 30 seconds of that burn as well as the functioning of the spacecraft and the engine during the rest of the burn.
165:09:10 Pogue: Apollo 7, Apollo 7. One minute to LOS; Canaries at 14. Over.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. The command and service module total weight before this burn was 29 494 pounds before the thrust. After the thrust it was scheduled to be 25 036 pounds which would be a difference of 4 458 pounds. This is Apollo Control, 165 hours, 10 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7; we have had from all appearances a successful 5th and longest in duration SPS burn, which was scheduled to last for some 66 seconds, 30 seconds of which was manual thrust vector controlled by spacecraft commander Schirra. The resulting orbital situation now is 89 nautical miles perigee, or a low point, by 243 nautical miles apogee, or high point. The original aim was 89.8 nautical miles perigee, 240.6 nautical miles apogee. Spacecraft commander Schirra indicated the machine performed beautifully. We don't have any more definitive readouts at this time. We anticipate contact with the Canary Islands tracking station at 165 hours, 14 minutes into the mission, some 3 minutes from this time. At 165:11, this is Apollo Control.
165:13:11 Schirra (onboard): The changeover from the G&N control on the number 5 burn through the MTVC was very smooth. The error needles did not displace more than about 1 or 2 degrees, and the system responded very well coming back into null. And the roll went off about 2 degrees at the beginning of the burn on the G&N phase and came back in before I took over. I took over when all error needles were practically null, and the displacement was very minute, meaning that the ground update on the Q-ball was very good.
165:13:53 Schirra (onboard): The burn proceeded normally until cutoff. One, the DELTA-V counter was hit by direct sunrays and was almost impossible to read. Two, a change in procedure that had not been planned for was implemented just before the burn. An extra 50 feet per secood was added to the DELTA-V counter to permit a DELTA-V thrust cutoff rather than a DELTA-V counter cutoff. And this, coupled with the sunrays on the DELTA-V counter, caused us to overburn 50 feet per second.
CANARY (REV 105)
165:14:40 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston through Canary.
165:14:42 Cunningham: Roger. Hey, Bill. we've had our primary evaporator shut down for - coming on to about 36 hours, I guess, or 30 hours. How often am I going to have to reservice that? It's going to be suscepable to drying out just like the secondary, isn't it? [Pause]
165:14:49 Pogue: Stand by.
Comm break.
165:16:01 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Recommend leave primary evaporator as is. We will open up back pressure valve prior to 48 hours elapsed, and ground is not particularly worried about that. [Long pause]
165:16:19 Cunningham: Thank you. I'm glad they are not.
165:16:21 Pogue: That's very reassuring. [Pause]
165:16:29 Cunningham: If you read, rock your tower, will you?
165:16:32 Pogue: Roger. [Pause]
165:16:37 Schirra: Hey, Bill, how come you let the third team stay on for the big burn? [Pause]
165:16:43 Pogue: Well, we had to have some practice.
165:16:46 Schirra: Yes, you'll have something to say in your press conference today. [Pause]
165:16:50 Pogue: What's this! [Pause]
165:16:54 Schirra: Aren't you having those duty press conferences when you break up? [Pause]
165:16:59 Pogue: Oh, I've been working the graveyard shift. I haven't had any of those. [Pause]
165:17:04 Schirra: Oh, the press corps goes to bed when you're working?
165:17:06 Pogue: Right. Donn and I have been having conversations. [Pause]
165:17:10 Schirra: Bill, we've been getting briefed during the day. [Long pause]
165:17:53 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Canary; Tananarive at 31. [Pause]
165:17:59 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
165:18:08 Schirra: Our residuals are exactly 50 feet per second. [Pause]
165:18:14 Pogue: Say again, Wally.
165:18:16 Schirra: I said our residuals are exactly 50 feet per second.
165:18:19 Pogue: Roger. Copy that.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 165 hours 22 minutes into the flight. Over the Canary Islands a few minutes ago Wally Schirra had some observations about the press corps covering Apollo 7. Here is that conversation.
165:24:10 Schirra (onboard): The time, 165 hours 24 minutes; I don't remember if I recorded this or not, so I will do it again. The field of view in the sextant goes out to about 57 degrees; the field of view in the telescope is limited to about 38 or 39 degrees.
165:30:51 Eisele (onboard): Time, 165 hours 30 minutes; I just mapped the field of view in the telescope and the sextant against the bright earth background. I find the telescope - both of them are symmetrical, that is, they are the same trunnion angle out to the edge of the field of vision all the way around. Telescope is about 42 degrees from the trunnion and the sextant is about 56 degrees. I noticed when we are looking at stars, that the field of view in the telescope seems to be more like 38 or 39. I think probably this is because there may be some greater light loss out at the edges that obscures stars, but does not obscure bright earth objects.
This is Apollo Control Houston 165 hours 31 minutes into the flight. We are about to tag up with Apollo 7 by Tananarive. Let's listen.
165:32:05 Schirra (onboard): Frame 11, magazine R, Lake Chad, Africa.
165:32:29 Swigert: [Garble].
TANANARIVE (REV 105)
165:32:50 Pogue: Apollo 7, Housten through Tananarive. [Pause]
165:32:54 Cunningham (onboard): This is Apollo 7. Say again.
165:32:55 Schirra: Put down a plot [garble] lake [garble] and Lake Victoria, frame 11, magazine R as in Romeo. [Pause]
165:33:04 Pogue: Roger. Wally, just one thing on T align for this passive thermo control test: if you set in the T align that we have given you prior to 166 plus 50, you'll have to do it over again. [Long pause]
165:33:21 Schirra (onboard): Getting good now. Did you say 166:507 Jack?
165:33:24 Swigert: I'm sorry; that's 165 plus 50. [Long pause]
165:33:37 Schirra: Starting out real nice down there today. [Long pause]
165:34:02 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7. [Pause]
165:34:06 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
165:34:08 Schirra: May I have the coordinates for the station at Tananarive? I'll try to get a picture of it.
165:34:11 Schirra (onboard): Do it fast, though.
165:34:12 Swigert: Roger. Stand by. [Long pause]
165:34:33 Swigert: ApoLlo 7, Houston. [Pause]
165:34:41 Eisele: Go ahead.
165:34:42 Swigert: Donn. if you set in the T align that we gave you for this passive thermo control test prior to 165 plus 50, you'll have to redo it again. [Long pause]
165:34:55 Schirra: We understand that. That's why we had it up there originally.
165:34:58 Swigert: Okay. Real fine.
165:35:00 Schirra: Yes, that's two for today. We've really got it in. [Pause]
165:35:05 Eisele: Jack, why do I have to do it over, offhand? Is it that far in error, or did you say you were going to fine tune it? [Pause]
165:35:11 Swigert: Well, what it does, you'll be over - one rev ahead on the integration there. [Pause]
165:35:21 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7. Over. [Pause]
165:35:25 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, are you still there?
165:35:26 Swigert: Roger, Walt.
165:35:27 Cunningham: Are you familiar with our fuel pump problem? Fuel pump 2? We got fuel pump 2 back on the line. Do you want me to leave it on until the condencer is off - temperature hits 200 and starts cycling back and forth between 200 on condencer exhaust and 380 on skin temp? Or just save it for when I need it? I'd just as soon leave it on the line, unless somebody else has strong druthers. [Long pause]
165:35:57 Swigert: Okay. Walt, we would like to leave fuel cell on the line to see if TCE goes on up toward 200 again. [Pause]
165:36:07 Cunningham: [Garble] again, and if it's okay with you, I'll just leave it at 200 and cycle back and forth as per our cycling procedures. [Long pause]
165:36:21 Swigert: Affirmative, Walt. [Pause]
165:36:25 Eisele (onboard): Forget the Tananarive coordinates.
165:36:34 Cunningham: Houston, are you still there?
165:36:36 Cunningham: You still there, Jack?
165:36:37 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Go ahead. [Pause]
165:36:42 Cunningham: Roger. We have a large puddle of water on the aft bulkhead after our last burn; looks like it's probably a good pint. We've marked the perimeter of the puddle on the aft bulkhead, and somebody can calculate how much water was in there. [Long pause]
165:36:58 Swigert: Roger. Understand.
165:36:59 Cunningham (onboard): You might make a note...
165:37:01 Cunningham: There is a kind of meniscus effect. This water sort of bunches up off the floor. [Long pause]
165:37:16 Cunningham: We also had water coming out of the water gun during the day, but not a lot. [Pause]
165:37:21 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
165:37:24 Schirra: It's coming out in big drops. [Pause]
165:37:30 Schirra: Have you been briefed on the problem we had on the fuel panel's number 5 burn with the 50 feet per second added? [Long pause]
165:37:42 Swigert: Okay. Wally, the COMM here at Tananarive isn't too good. We'll pick you up over Carnarvon, and let's get a good rundown on it then at 165 plus 47. [Long pause]
165:37:55 Schirra: Okay. [Long pause]
165:38:18 Schirra: Getting to see [garble].
165:38:19 Schirra (onboard): ... a free ride.
165:38:33 Cunningham (onboard): On the onboard tape, we are getting a free ride again due to perigee torque.
165:39:03 Schirra: At 165 hours 39 minutes, the water gun's putting out more gas than water at this point. [Long pause]
165:39:15 Schirra (onboard): The local vertical attitude as to the perigee torque is 240 degrees pitch.
165:39:19 Swigert: Roger. Copy that, Wally. We're just about to lose you over Tananarive. Pick you up over Carnarvon. [Pause]
165:39:25 Schirra: You copying our perigee torque here?
Long comm break.
165:39:26 Schirra (onboard): I'm getting a 3 - about 0.35-degree-per-second pitch rate. Our pitch is about 250 degrees local vertical - now it's about 270.
This is Apollo Control. You heard Wally Schirra note during that pass the water gun is sputtering a bit. As he put it it's putting out more gas than it is water. We'll be taking a look at that system here as the spacecraft swings across the Indian Ocean. At 165 hours 41 minutes into the flight this is Apollo Control.
165:45:03 Schirra (onboard): Frame 13, magazine R for Romeo, horizon check at apogee of 240 miles.
CARNARVON (REV 105)
165:49:34 Swigert: Apollo 7, Housten through Carnarvon. [Pause]
165:49:38 Schirra: Roger. I prepared your torque start on this one with the thrust on the perigee about 230 degrees local, pitch down 30 degrees, went right on down through 270; and as we climbed to a high apogee, there was not enough Q there to affect us, so we did a nice sweet loop right through apogee - [Long pause]
165:49:58 Swigert: Roger. Copy that.
165:50:00 Schirra: [Garble] through 90 degrees local vertical.
165:50:03 Swigert: Roger. Copy that.
165:50:05 Schirra: The remark I tried to make at Tananarive is let's not make changes in the system at the last minute. That's how I got a sweet little 50 feet per second overburn on that burn 5. [Pause]
165:50:15 Schirra: Roger. Copy, Wally.
165:50:18 Schirra: I thought we learned that a long time ago. It would have been 100 feet per second if I hadn't cut it down to 50. Our problem was the Sun hit right on the DELTA-V counter, and the burn switch was up full bright; and that was not sufficient to keep it illuminated. [Long pause]
165:50:37 Swigert: Okay. Understand.
165:50:40 Schirra: Now we did do burn 5 with MCC in the past. [Pause]
165:50:47 Swigert: Okay. Wally, on the fuel cell: we have been plotting RAD IN and RAD OUT temperatures, and it looks like we got a good DELTA-T, so it appears right now that the coolant pump is working. [Long pause]
165:50:59 Schirra: Good news.
165:51:02 Schirra: Except what is the problem then?
165:51:05 Swigert: Wally, we are really looking at the data here, and we are going to let you know as soon as we get some time history on the data after Carnarvon here. [Pause]
165:51:14 Schirra: I think we're going to have a new page in that malfunctionbook.
165:51:16 Swigert: What we would like to do is see if the condenser exhaust temperature will stabilize. That's why we would like you to let it go to 200. [Pause]
165:51:25 Schirra: Got it.
165:51:26 Cunningham: We can't possibly have an internal problem, Jack. One of the things that surprised me was when I took fuel cell 2 OFF, fuel cell 1 then started to climb in condenser exhaust and skin temp and at a greater rate than fuel cell 3, although both of them were picking up the same amount of added load. Fuel cell 3 held everything right in there; its controls seem to be a lot better than fuel cell 1. And as soon as I put fuel cell 2 back on the line to pick up its share of the load, fuel cell 1 came back on down again. [Long pause]
165:51:57 Swigert: Roger. We saw all that, Walt. We are looking right now at something in the regenerator there. [Pause]
165:52:04 Cunningham: Roger. Sounds about right.
At 165 hours S2 minutes. And through Carnarvon, we are having a discussion with the crew about fuel cells. Let's listen." [Long pause]
165:52:20 Swigert: And, Apollo 7...
165:52:21 Schirra: [Garble]. To cut the 0.3 degree per second in pitch, and we will start looking for inertial. [Pause]
165:52:27 Swigert: Roger. Nov, Wally, we showed ...
165:52:30 Schirra: That's close to it, I figure.
165:52:33 Swigert: We would like you to switch quad Bravo to secondary tanks now. [Pause]
165:52:40 Schirra: Roger. Bravo secondary ON, Bravo primary OFF. [Pause]
165:52:49 Swigert: Copy that. [Pause]
165:52:53 Schirra: You must know something we don't on that one. Oh, you're reading that, aren't you? [Pause]
165:52:59 Swigert: Roger. Wally, we used just, a little bit more than we expected duaring the burn on quad Bravo there. [Pause]
165:53:07 Schirra: How close is the balance now?
165:53:10 Swigert: Stand by. We will have it for you.
165:53:12 Schirra: Good. [Pause]
165:53:21 Swigert: Wallv, the difference between Bravo and Delta is 13 pounds. [Pause]
165:53:27 Schirra: Okay. [Long pause]
165:54:16 Swigert: Walt, I have this SPS propellant thermal control PAD to give you whenever you are ready. [Pause]
165:54:26 Cunningham: Wait one. [Long pause]
165:55:09 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
165:55:12 Swigert: Go ahead.
165:55:13 Schirra: Did you notice our DSKY?
165:55:16 Swigert: Negative. I've been looking at the fuel cells. Stand by. [Pause]
165:55:21 Schirra: And do you notice our inertial attitude? That's on you all. [Long pause]
165:55:37 Schirra: We had free ride to 000; now, we got to go fly back again. [Pause]
165:55:43 Swigert: Roger. Copy. [Long pause]
165:56:36 Schirra: Hey, Jack.
165:56:38 Swigert: Go ahead. [Pause]
165:56:42 Schirra: Do you have the SPS propellant thermnl control update?
165:56:45 Swigert: Roger. Your T zero is 167 plus 57, roll 004, pitch 183, yaw 020. [Long pause]
165:57:09 Schirra: Is our T align required on this one? [Pause]
165:57:13 Swigert: Negative, Wally. [Pause]
165:57:19 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause]
165:57:51 Swigert: Apollo 7, we are 1 minute LOS Carnarvon; we pick you up Honeysuckle. You want to turn your S-band volume up. [Pause]
165:58:00 Schirra: Okay. What time do you pick them up, Jack?
165:58:03 Swigert: We've got continuous coverage now. We are realty high; we've got wide overlapping coverage. [Pause]
165:58:08 Schirra: Very good.
Comm break.
HONEYSUCKLE (REV 105)
165:59:31 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Pause]
165:59:38 Schirra: Copy. But you sure have a lot of grass in the background. I'm keeping the volume down. [Pause]
165:59:44 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
Comm break.
166:00:57 Schirra: Apollo 7.
166:00:59 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
166:01:01 Schirra: Would you check to see if with the Maurer movie camera, 18mm lens, at 1 frames per second, whether we overlapped on frame exposure? 0ver. [Long pause]
166:01:18 Swigert: Okay. Wally, we have a real garbled signal here at Honeysuckle. I'd like to wait and get you through Hawaii. We pick up Hawaii at 166 plus 15. [Long pause]
166:01:30 Schirra: Okay. The subject is the movie camera. [Pause]
166:01:35 Swigert: Okay. I copied something about the movie camera, but I didn't get it all. [Pause]
166:01:39 Schirra: Okay. I'll wait.
166:01:40 Swigert: Roger.
Very long comm break.
166:06:23 Schirra (onboard): The time is 166 hours and 6 minutes. I've just done the P52 to align for the passive thermal control test, and I've got some torquing angles here which reflect the error inherent in the coarse align. The numbers are plus 00970, minus 05627. That's 5-1/2 degrees in pitch, either gimbal, minus 00370.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 166 hours, 15 minutes into the flight. A few minutes ago it was confirmed to us through Norad and through the Goddard Space Flight Center sources, that the S-IVB, the second stage of the Apollo 7 booster, has reentered the earth's atmosphere, and apparently burned up. The reentry took place south and east of the Indian Pennisula in the Indian Ocean. Presently estimating the time of reentry at 4:30 am, Central Daylight Time, on this time. We have acquired through Hawaii and here's how that conversation is going.
HAWAII THROUGH ANTIGUA (REV 105)
166:15:43 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
166:15:46 Schirra: Roger. I've stopped losing at playing the game with this deal on. Let's get a good mark on the perigee torquing. [Pause]
166:15:56 Schirra: The whole thing's going to be automatic power as far as I'm concerned so that fuels on the ground test, and let's get some data on how fast it goes up at this high velocity at perigee. [Long pause]
166:16:07 Swigert: Okay. Real fine, Wally.
166:16:10 Schirra: As I see it, perigee is at about 43 just 7 minutes before the start of the test. [Pause]
166:16:18 Swigert: Okay. Copy that. [Pause]
166:16:28 Schirra: You might get prepared for fuel usage on this, too; I'd like to find out if this might be a setup you'd have just prior to a burn for some later mission. [Pause]
166:16:37 Swigert: Okay. We'll get a real good hack on it as you go through.
166:16:40 Schirra: Very good.
166:16:43 Swigert: And I'm ready - what were you asking me about the movie camera? [Pause]
166:16:48 Schirra: Oh, yes. I'm going to try to do some strip mapping. We did some in the States the other day when the hurricane was coming through. [Pause]
166:16:55 Swigert: Roger.
166:16:57 Schirra: And we shot at one frame a second with an 18mm lens, and I'm not sure whether we have overlap or not. Could you check on that? [Pause]
166:17:06 Swigert: Okay. Will do.
166:17:07 Schirra: And - we may need to use six frames a second, but, if so, we can handle that, too. [Pause]
166:17:11 Swigert: Okay.
Comm break.
166:19:37 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7.
166:19:39 Swigert: Go ahead, Walt.
166:19:40 Cunningham: What about a map update when yon get a chance, Jack?
166:19:42 Swigert: In work. [Long pause]
166:20:08 Swigert: Okay. Walt, ready on your map update.
166:20:11 Cunningham: Go.
166:20:12 Swigert: Okay. For REV 106, the time of the node is 167 plus 42 plus 37, longitude 157.3 degrees east. [Long pause]
166:20:30 Cunningham: Say the time again, please.
166:20:32 Swigert: Roger. 167 plus 42 plus 37. [Pause]
166:20:40 Cunningham: Roger. Thank you. [Long pause]
166:20:56 Swigert: And I have the morning news if you would like to hear it. [Pause]
166:21:00 Schirra: I'm ready to copy.
166:21:01 Schirra: We have the Xerox machine working. [Pause]
166:21:06 Swigert: Roger. Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle 0nassis are to be married soon. She and her children left New York last night to join him at his home in Greece. He's one of the world's wealthier men, 62 years old, she's 39. We saw... [Long pause]
166:21:23 Schirra: That's Greek to me.
166:21:25 Swigert: Roger. We saw the spacecraft loud and clear this morning from Houston. [Pause]
166:21:29 Schirra: Oh, great.
166:21:30 Cunningham: Very good.
166:21:32 Schirra: [Garble]. [Pause]
166:21:37 Swigert: And from the avalanche of cards and letters that Penny's gotten, everybody must have seen your sign. [Long pause]
166:21:49 Eisele: Oh, no.
166:21:52 Cunningham: Hope somebody's reading them. [Pause]
166:21:56 Schirra: We were trying for a - you can tell this on Bill Parker, he came back too fast - referring to a weekly series Emmy award, and he said "Hammy" award. It was broken today. [Long pause]
166:22:09 Cunningham: They'll understand; they were going to throw us in the category of specials. [Pause]
166:22:13 Swigert: Roger. And Gladys is supposed to come onshore today near Tampa, early tomorrow. Winds are down to about 65 miles per hour; weather bureau calls it a minimal storm. [Long pause]
166:22:27 Schirra: That's fortunate. [Pause]
166:22:35 Swigert: And the US won its sixth gold medal in track yesterday by winning the high hurdles.
Comm break.
166:23:45 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
166:23:48 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
166:23:49 Schirra: Roger. We lost you after the sixth gold medal report. [Pause]
166:23:55 Swigert: That's all the morning news.
166:23:58 Schirra: Okay. I send you one - thank the boys in the back room for the pitch and yaw gimbal setttngs; that was great on that engine. [Pause]
166:24:05 Swigert: Roger.
166:24:06 Schirra: Just slid right in.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control here, Well, we seem to have a very reactive, jolly crew this morning. Upon being read the item of the upcoming marriage of Mrs. Kennedy and Mr. Onassis, we thought we heard Captain Schirra remark "That's Greek to me." - and a little later they all seemed to take great delight in the fact that Wally's secretary is being deluged with the cards and letters which were advertised earlier in the mission. The comm is a little choppy here over the Huntsville, but we'll continue to monitor.
166:25:32 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7. Are you through Honeysuckle [garble]. [Pause]
166:25:37 Swigert: Say again, Walt?
166:25:39 Cunningham: You're coming through Honeysuckle, right? [Pause]
166:25:44 Cunningham: Can I confirm that that last map update that you gave was the next ascending node coming up? [Long pause]
166:25:58 Swigert: Apollo 7, could you switch omnies? [Pause]
166:26:04 Cunningham: Roger. Jack, could you confirm that the map update that I have is for the next ascending node that is coming up? [Pause]
166:26:11 Swigert: Stand by. [Pause]
166:26:15 Cunningham: I show 167 plus 43. Could you verify? [Pause]
166:26:23 Swigert: Roger. Walt, the time of the node is 167 plus 42 plus 37; that will be for the orbit coming up. [Long pause]
166:26:56 Cunningham: Okay. Jak, if you get a chance in the future, we'd just as soon - we have the ascending node about ... [Long pause]
166:27:14 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
166:27:24 Cunningham: [Garble]. Two revs ahead because our chart is not as accurate as it used to be with our change in inclination. That way, we can have a more accurate chart for a longer period of time. [Pause]
166:27:32 Swigert: Okay'. Walt, we just had a handover, and I didn't get all you said, but I th_wk the basic part of it is you'd like a map update about every two revs. Is that Charlie? [Long pause]
166:27:47 Cunningham: Negative. We'd like - whenever we call for a map update, we'd like to have it for about two ascending nodes in the future. 0ver. [Pause]
166:27:54 Swigert: Okay. Copy that. [Pause]
166:27:58 Schirra: Jack, you might tell the boys at Carnarvon we got a good picture of them today.
166:28:01 Swigert: Okay.
Long comm break.
166:34:21 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
166:34:24 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
166:34:25 Schirra: Did you get me an answer on that frame overlap?
166:34:28 Swigert: It's in work.
166:34:29 Schirra: Okay. We're about ready to strip here.
166:34:31 Swigert: Okay. [Pause]
166:34:35 Schirra: You can play the music.
166:34:37 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
HAWAII THROUGH ANTIGUA (REV 106)
166:35:35 Schirra: Houston, you have a little high cirrus today, but generally wide open. [Pause]
166:35:40 Swigert: Roger. Concur. [Pause]
166:35:44 Schirra: We see no thunderstorms in the Gulf, none to the west of you. There is a band of weather, approximately around the San Antonio area, and another band over towards New Orleans. [Long pause]
166:35:56 Swigert: Roger. Thank you.
166:35:57 Schirra: We are stripping at one frame per second.
Comm break.
166:37:08 Schirra: Getting a good look at the hurricane, Jack. [Pause]
166:37:12 Swigert: Roger.
166:37:14 Schirra: She's high and wide. We are just passing the eye, got a glimpse of it. [Pause]
166:37:23 Cunningham: Took a photograph of it. That was frame 13 of magazine R. [Pause]
166:37:32 Swigert: Okay. Copy that, Wally. [Long pause]
166:38:17 Schirra: The Cape is loud and clear. We can see all the launch pad, and it looks like she's ready for business. [Pause]
166:38:23 Eisele: We can see Saturn V on the pad.
166:38:26 Swigert: Oh, Roger. [Long pause]
166:39:06 Schirra: Jack, those guys over in Helmut Kuehnel's shop should have that answer for you by now on that film overlap. [Pause]
166:39:11 Swigert: Roger. Wally, I've been riding them, and they say it's coming. [Pause]
166:39:21 Swigert: Okay. Wally, I've got some happiness for you.
166:39:24 Schirra: Go ahead.
166:39:25 Swigert: Okay. For your fuel chart ...
166:39:27 Schirra: Go.
166:39:28 Swigert: ... Okay. Present value on your chart should be 598. Your SCS redline 554, DAP redline 472, and the hybrid redline 236. How's that for happiness? [Long pause]
166:39:50 Schirra: Very nice. We're up on it. [Pause]
166:39:54 Swigert: And the quad balance is such that we have got all those redlines. [Pause]
166:40:00 Cunningham: Jack, does that 598 include the 60-80 pounds of unusable? [Pause]
166:40:09 Swigert: Includes the unusable.
166:40:10 Cunningham: That's a chart update?
166:40:12 Swigert: Roger. That's your chart update, Walt. [Pause]
166:40:16 Schirra: Okay. I want to see what kind of fuel we use after this session.
166:40:19 Swigert: Okay. [Pause]
166:40:23 Schirra: We're whistling right through perigee. [Pause]
166:40:27 Cunningham: Are you plotting these on your chart down there, Jack? [Pause]
166:40:31 Swigert: Yes, sir; I am.
166:40:33 Cunningham: Okay. Look at the difference between yesterday's number 666, and a 598. Like 68 pounds. [Pause]
166:40:42 Swigert: Affirmative. We are calling it here. [Pause]
166:40:48 Schirra: That's quite a big drop.
166:40:51 Swigert: I agree. [Long pause]
166:41:31 Eisele: Say, Jack, this is Donn.
166:41:33 Swigert: Go ahead.
166:41:35 Eisele: That seemed like an awful lot of fuel for no more than we've done since yesterday. Could you have someone run through their data down there and see if they can ascertain just when and in what condition we used up all the fuel? [Long pause]
166:41:47 Swigert: Okay. We are doing a good analysis on it now, Donn. We will get it back to you. [Pause]
166:41:51 Eisele: Okay. Because I don't think we should have used more than about 15 or 20 pounds at the outside for that burn today. [Pause]
166:41:58 Swigert: Okay. In work.
Comm break.
This is Apollo control here. This fuel discussion, quads A through D, as in dog, read like this presently, according to our televised data coming through from telemetry. Quad A 150 pounds, quad B 149, quad C, charlie, 146, quad D, as in dog. 162. The SPS fuel remaining 1,118 pounds, the SPS oxidizer remaining, 1,859 pounds. We used about 1700 hundred pounds of fuel and nearly 3,000 pounds of oxidizer, 2800 hundred, in that big burn this morning.
166:43:33 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
166:43:34 Schirra: Go ahead..
166:43:35 Swigert: We've got an updated number for you on your chart; value. [Pause]
166:43:40 Schirra: Go.
166:43:41 Swigert: Okay. 628.
166:43:43 Schirra: Ah, ha. That's a little better. That is much better hews. [Pause]
166:43:50 Swigert: It's 30 pounds more happiness.
166:43:52 Schirra: That's a heck of a deal, a real hump in that curve.
166:43:55 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
166:44:03 Schirra: [Garble] about our fuel here if we keep that up. [Pause]

166:54:15 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
166:54:18 Schirra: Roger. Loud and clear. I'm pumping it out. [Pause]
166:54:28 Swigert: Walt, something - a note of interest here. The TCE that you are reading on your gage is alrproximately 3 degrees higher than the actual value. [Long pause]
166:54:43 Cunningham: Roger. The - it triggered the master alarm at 178 yesterday [garble]. [Pause]
166:54:51 Swigert: Okay. Copy that, Walt. And the answer, Wally, to your question on the 16mm camera: at 90 miles, when you are going through perigee, you'll have about 70 percent overlap at one frame per second, and at apogee of 265, you'll have about a 75 percent overlap. [Long pause]
166:55:14 Schirra: Roger. Thank you. [Long pause]
166:55:39 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7. Are you getting our data real time, or do you want us to be recording it? [Long pause]
166:55:54 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7. How do you read?
166:55:56 Swigert: 7, could you say again your message? [Pause]
166:56:02 Cunningham: The DTO requires low bit rate [garble] is it playing when we leave your control? [Pause]
166:56:12 Swigert: Okay. Stand by, Walt. [Long pause]
166:56:46 Swigert: Walt, we're playing the DSE as normal. We have a high bit rate over the stations. We'll put it low bit rate RECORD as we get LOS and opposite omni. [Long pause]
166:57:03 Cunningham: Roger. Just want you to know: we are doing a DTO now, and we will need the tape recorder back when we leave you. [Long pause]
166:57:15 Swigert: We'll give it back to you as we leave you, Walt. [Pause]
166:57:24 Swigert: Al_llo 7, we'd like to go quad Alfa SECONDARY. [Long pause]
166:57:48 Swigert: Apollo 7, did you copy that?
166:57:51 Cunningham: Roger. [Long pause]
166:58:26 Swigert: Walt, you are confirming quad A is in SECONDARY now? [Pause]
166:58:31 Cunningham: Affirmative.
166:58:33 Swigert: Thank you. [Long pause]
166:58:45 Schirra: Jack, say again about quad A.
166:58:48 Swigert: Roger. Wally, we'd like you to switch to secondary tanks on quad Alfa. [Pause]
166:58:56 Schirra: You want quad A SECONDARY. Is that correct?
166:58:59 Swigert: That is correct. [Pause]
166:59:06 Schirra: Quad A is now SECONDARY.

This is Apollo Control Houston, at 167 hours, 25 minutes into the flight. The crew has been having a late breakfast for about the past hour, and we had no contact with them through Tananarive; the communications were so choppy during the earlier pass, it was just decided not to attempt it. This morning, we did put in a call and establish the line but that's all that was done. The spacecraft is in a cold soak, service propulsion system cold soak, test, wherein for approximately 1 complete rev, the attitude will be held so that the service propulsion systems sees only cold space and not the Sun. We have put in a call through Carnarvon however little more than an identifying answer has come back. Let's listen.

167:29:16 Schirra: Ah, ha. That's what I asked yesterday. 168:30? [Pause]
167:29:20 Swigert: Roger. 168 plus 30, begin the SCS attitude control test, and you can cut it off at 169:10. Thought I'd help you out a little bit more: going 40 minutes rather than an hour. [Long pause]
167:29:36 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
167:29:45 Schirra: Better take us T plus 3 hours into the test here. [Pause]

167:31:50 Schirra: I'd say it's flying about a two - two and a half degree cone around the three zeros. [Pause]
167:31:56 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
167:31:58 Schirra: This is very well. [Pause]
167:32:04 Swigert: Wally, is that cone getting any bigger, or is it staying about the same? [Pause]
167:32:08 Schirra: It seems to be getting just a little bit bigger now; it's going out to three as you can see. [Pause]
167:32:14 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
167:32:22 Schirra: It is diverging slightly. [Long pause]
167:32:46 Schirra: That proves a point; pitch is going out. [Long pause]
167:33:21 Schirra: And the flight way rate developing which is making that pitch yaw develop. [Pause]
167:33:27 Swigert: Copy that. [Pause]
167:33:31 Schirra: And our Q is probably picking up - that's why. [Pause]
167:33:39 Swigert: You're right at apogee now. [Pause]
167:33:43 Schirra: Oh, it is now?
167:33:45 Swigert: You're 20 minutes -
167:33:46 Schirra: I'll be darned.
167:33:47 Schirra: Oh, yes. We got 45 minutes to go, right? [Long pause]
167:34:10 Schirra: How much more time do you have in this pass?
167:34:12 Swigert: We are just about 1 minute LOS Carnarvon. We have a very low angle pass at Guam at 39, then Hawaii at 50. [Long pause]
167:34:25 Schirra: Roger. I'm only about a minute away from end of test, so you can take these angles for us. [Pause]
167:34:31 Swigert: Okay. We are copying them.
167:34:34 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
167:34:40 Schirra: The reason yaw is decreasing, of course, is we are flying across the belly band now. [Pause]
167:34:45 Swigert: Roger.
Long comm break.
We have lost signal through Carnarvon and ye will pick up the Spacecraft in Hawaii. Guam will be very low. I doubt they even established contact. About 167 hours 55 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control.
GUAM (REV 106)
167:41:29 Swigert: ApallO 7, Houston througgh Guam. [Pause]
167:41:33 Cunningham: Roger. Jack, incidentally, I'm manually balancing my hydrogen tanks now, and I'd appreciate it if you guys would keep an eye on those quantities and let me know when you think we're close on the balancing. You're a little more accurate than I am. [Long pause]
167:41:47 Swigert: Will do.
Long comm break.
HAWAII (REV 106)
167:51:45 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. [Pause]
167:51:50 Schirra: Roger.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control Houston 167 hours and 51 minutes into the flight on the 106th revolution around the Earth. A call has gone out to the spacecraft through Hawaii, we haven't gotten a "Roger". Our apogee and perigee right now 89.9 nautical miles by 244.4 nautical miles. Earlier today you heard discussions about the fuel cells. Let's take a look and see how they're fairing, reading data coming to us through Hawaii the load sharing looks like this: 32 percent on fuel cell 01, 34.9 on fuel cell 02, and 35.1 on fuel cell 03. They're pulling within 24 to 26 amps each, and all in all are behaving quite well. The temperature started to mount on one of the fuel cells earlier, and it was taken off the line. Our present temperatures read like thus: fuel cell 01 160 degrees F, and fuel cell 02 178 degrees F. Fuel cell 01 161. We'll monitor here the Hawaii pass and come back with more information about consumables in just a moment.
