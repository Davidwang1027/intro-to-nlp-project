GUAM (REV 151)
240:01:37 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Guam. Standing by.[Pause]
240:01:44 Eisele: Roger.
240:01:46 Swigert: Walt, one addition to the Flight Plan is a fuel cell O2 purge at 249 plus 30. [Ppause]
240:01:57 Cunningham: Roger. [Pause]
240:02:06 Swigert: And I've got the morning news here. [Pause]
240:02:12 Schirra: Okay. We'll copy.
240:02:14 Swigert: Okay. The papers and television this morning are loaded with pictures of the big wedding over in Greece. And Gladys brought much needed rain to North Carolina. It had been suffering from a drought. Maurice Chevalier, who is 80, made his final stage appearance in Paris yesterday. He's been in show business for 68 years. And over to some of the pro ball results: Green Bay and Detroit tied, Chicago whomped Philadelphia, San Francisco over New York, New Orleans heat Pittsburg, Dallas over Minnesota, Cleveland upset Baltimore, St. Louis slaughtered Washington, LA beat Atlanta, and the Oilers, you got.
240:03:08 Eisele: So Mendell got heat.
240:03:12 Swigert: That's in the papers today, too.
Long comm break.
Apollo Control, Houston here, 240 hours, 8 minutes into the flight. From Carnarvon, we have some tape, we're in Guam now and we'll just bridge over and pick up the conversation that has developed there
240:09:30 Swigert: Okay. Apollo 7, Houston. About 30 seconds LOS Guam; Hawaii at 15.
240:09:36 Schirra: Roger.
Long comm break.
HAWAII through TEXAS (REV 151)
240:15:37 Swigert: Apollo 7. Houston through Hawaii.
240:15:40 Cunningham: Roger.
240:15:43 Swigert: Walt, on the primary evaporator, we would like to have you reservice it and leave it off. [Pause]
240:15:51 Cunningham: Roger. Two minutes' worth?
240:15:53 Swigert: Affirmative. [Long pause]
240:16:15 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We are ready to send you the NAV vector, state vector update. Would you go to ACCEPT? [Pause]
240:16:27 Swigert: And I have the NAV check for you when you are ready to copy it. [Pause]
240:16:38 Cunningham: Ready to accept, Jack.
240:16:39 Swigert: Okay. Coming up. [Pause]
This is Apollo Control, at 240 hours, 16 minutes. Or to say it another way, 19 hours, 22 minutes from retrofire. Deorbit, as it is called in Apollo. We have tagged up with Apollo 7 over Hawaii and here is how the conversation is going.
240:16:47 Cunningham: Go ahead with your NAV, Jack.
240:16:50 Swigert: Okay. GET 246 plus 30 plus 0000 plus 2607 plus 15014 0947.
240:17:19 Cunningham: 246 30 0000 plus 2607 plus 15014 0947.
240:17:30 Swigert: Roger. That's correct.
240:17:34 Swigert: And we'll be waiting a rev to give you the block data number 26.
240:17:41 Cunningham: Okay. Could you give us a map update?
240:17:45 Swigert: Okay - [Pause]
240:17:49 Cunningham: We would like to have the present orbit or the last one that you got.
240:17:56 Swigert: Okay. Stand by here. NAV check is in, state vector is in, and the computer is yours. [Pause]
240:18:09 Swigert: Okay. The present orbit for a map update 239 plus 59 plus 37, longitude 127.9 degrees east. [Long pause]
240:18:34 Cunningham: Roger. Thank you, Jack. [Pause]
240:18:42 Schirra: We are GO on your NAV check.
240:18:45 Swigert: Copy.
Comm break.
240:21:03 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
240:21:06 Cunningham: GO ahead, Jack.
240:21:07 Swigert: Roger, Walt. We are copying a little bit high on the steam pressure; did you do a normal service on primary evaporator? [Pause]
240:21:21 Cunningham: Negative, Jack, but I got more than 2 minutes of water in it.
240:21:26 Swigert: About how many minutes did you put in?
240:21:31 Cunningham: That was a little over 3 minutes.
240:21:32 Swigert: Okay. Copy.
Long comm break.
240:29:42 Swigert: Apollo 7, opposite Omni. [Pause]
240:29:50 Cunningham: You are on A now.
240:29:51 Swigert: Okay. [Pause]
240:30:01 Cunningham: Any suggestions on the water boiler? [Pause]
240:30:07 Swigert: No, Walt; we are still looking at massaging that down here. [Long pause]
240:30:27 Swigert: Walt, what we're doing is, we are going to do is, that we are comparing that primary evaporator now with previous couple of days data.
Comm break.
240:33:26 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
240:33:28 Cunningham: Go ahead, Jack.
240:33:32 Swigert: Have you initiated a battery charge on B yet?
240:33:36 Cunningham: Just now pulling the battery relay circuit breaker.
240:33:38 Swigert: Okay. Fine. We want to take a look at it before LOS Texas here. [Pause]
240:33:50 Cunningham: It's about the same thing it started at the other day, I think, a little over 2 amps.
240:33:54 Swigert: Okay.
Comm break.
HAWAII through TEXAS (REV 152)
240:35:01 Swigert: Hey, Walt, we are about 1 minute LOS Texas; we pick up Ascension at 54 for a short pass.
240:35:08 Cunningham: Roger. You reading the battery charge burn?
240:35:10 Swigert: Roger. Showing 2.3.
240:35:13 Cunningham: Roger. I'll make this a normal charge, down to .4 amps.
240:35:17 Swigert: Affirmative.
Very long comm break.
ASCENSION (REV 152)
240:55:02 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Pause]
240:55:06 Cunningham (onboard): Roger, Jack. We're just vacuuming up water in the bottom of the spacecraft - same situation we've had in the last - or so SPS burn.
240:55:08 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, do you have [garble] spacecraft [garble].
240:55:18 Swigert: Walt, we have a keyhole effect here at Ascension; you're about two-by. I can just barely make it out.
240:55:25 Cunningham: Roger. We understand.
Comm break.
240:57:42 Swigert: Apollo 7, 1 minute LOS Ascension; we pick you up at Tananarive at 08. [Pause]
240:57:47 Cunningham (onboard): Roger, Jack. Do you read now?
240:57:50 Cunningham: [Garble].
Very long comm break.
240:57:54 Cunningham (onboard): Do you read, Jack?
TANANARIVE (REV 152)
241:09:14 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Comm break.
241:09:17 Cunningham (onboard): Roger, loud and clear.
241:10:19 Cunningham (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7.
241:10:26 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Long comm break.
241:10:29 Cunningham (onboard): Roger, do you read?
241:10:32 Cunningham (onboard): Houston, do you read Apollo 7?
241:16:52 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We're about 2 minutes LOS Tananarive; we pick up the Mercury at 34. [Pause]
241:16:59 Cunningham (onboard): Roger, do you read Apollo 7 now?
241:17:01 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7. Out.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 241 hours and 33 minutes and back from lunch. In the last half hour to 45 minutes since our last transmission, we've had a very brief chat with 7 at Tananarive and we're about to acquire with the ship Mercury. Let's hear the Tananarive tag first.
MERCURY (REV 152)
241:34:23 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. [Long pause]
241:34:44 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
241:34:50 Schirra: Apollo 7 here.
241:34:52 Swigert: Okay. Wally, just one little bit of information I wanted to get from you. I want to see how that crack in the MET has progressed after this last burn. [Long pause]
241:35:13 Schirra: Looks like we have the one I described on the left side above "Hundreds of hours.
241:35:18 Swigert: Right. That's it.
241:35:20 Schirra: It has already reached the bottom of the glass trellis and the top below the "h" in the word "hours" to the bottom of "tens of hours." That goes all the way through. There are two smaller cracks that have developed above "Hundreds of hours." The crack on the second side has not changed since we first observed it.
241:35:43 Swigert: Okay. Something you might give some thought to on entry is saving some tape out before you restow everything and taping this glass up so that it probably doesn't come out when you splash down.
241:35:59 Schirra: Very good. [Pause]
241:36:08 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, this is Walt.
241:36:09 Swigert: Go ahead.
241:36:11 Cunningham: Roger. About 45 minutes ago, I turned the O2 fans 1 back AUTO and ran the fans 2 for 3 minutes.
241:36:22 Swigert: Okay. We copy that, Walt. And I have a -
241:36:27 Schirra: Jack, we've been trying to play a single thruster for roll, and I am not sure yet what quad you want to use for that. [Pause]
241:36:38 Swigert: Okay. We want to save quad B, Baker and Charlie, so use Quads Alpha and Delta us much as you can.
241:36:48 Schirra: Okay. Do you have, on the back of our schematics book, the plate on the thrusters? [Pause]
241:36:58 Swigert: I can get it for you. You want to know circuit configuration?
241:37:03 Schirra: Right. We've got it on the back of our schematics book, and I tried that, and it doesn't work.
241:37:11 Swigert: Okay.
241:37:12 Cunningham: It's the taped-in chart, that came, from the logistics training manual, Jack.
241:37:16 Swigert: Okay.
241:37:17 Schirra: Should be on the set you have there as a backup set.
241:37:20 Swigert: Yes, I've got it here.
241:37:23 Schirra: I'll have Walt call out what he told me.
241:37:26 Cunningham: Okay. It's probably in the front of yours.
241:37:29 Swigert: Yes, I've got it.
241:37:33 Cunningham: Okay. We were trying to use the quad A roll, and the channel switches were in A. So we pulled circuit breaker for A and C roll 2 main A. The channel switches were in A. [Pause]
241:37:55 Swigert: Okay.
241:37:57 Cunningham: That should give us A1 and A2 only, right?
241:38:01 Swigert: Right. You're not using it on minimum impulse, are you?
241:38:05 Cunningham: Yes. You have to use minimum impulse. That's B and D, isn't it?
241:38:10 Swigert: No, when you're in minimum impulse, you're going to use quads Baker and Charlie.
241:38:15 Cunningham: B and C, yes. That's what we did.
241:38:18 Swigert: Okay. Then when you pull AC roll to main A, you're going to knock out quads - the roll jets in quad Charlie. [Pause]
241:38:31 Cunningham: Yes, but right now, you want us to use A and D; but whenever we're at minimum impulse, we use B and C, so it looks like we're SOL for this one.
241:38:41 Swigert: Right. You'll have to go to ACCEL COMMAND if you want to get that configuration.
241:38:46 Cunningham: I think we will probably stay like this at MIN impulse.
241:38:49 Swigert: Okay.
241:38:50 Schirra: Yes, that's much cheaper, Jack.
241:38:51 Swigert: Right.
241:38:52 Schirra: We'll use an A and C roll.
241:38:54 Swigert: Okay.
241:38:57 Schirra: ACCEL is pretty nice, but if you bump it accidentally, you hose out quite a bit.
241:39:01 Swigert: Okay. We would like you to use B and D roll. You have a little more margin on quad Baker than you do on quad Charlie if you're going to be in minimum impulse. [Pause]
"Apollo Control, here. While he is reading up that update those of you in the News Center we would call your attention to the chart we have on your television matrix. The retrofire digitals they're down at the bottom of the chart. You'll see the GETI, ground elapsed time initiate, chart presently reads 259 hours, 39 minutes, 20 seconds .01 that's your start retrofire time, the best estimate right now. If you want to make a copy of that we will leave the chart up a few minutes.
241:39:14 Schirra: Since we finished the burn, we have used 19 pulses. [Pause]
241:39:23 Swigert: Okay.
241:39:24 Cunningham: I'm working on 50 pulses per pound. [Pause]
241:39:32 Swigert: Okay. And I have your block data number 26 when you're ready to copy it, Walt.
241:39:37 Cunningham: Go ahead. I'm ready to copy.
241:39:39 Swigert: Okay. 153 dash 4 Alpha plus 254 minus 1610 243 plus 11 plus 05 3069, 154 dash 1 Charlie dash 4 Charlie plus 163 minus 1610 244 plus 47 plus 45 2700, 155 dash Alpha Charlie minus 236 minus 0100 245 plus 22 plus 22 6914, 156 dash Alpha Charlie minus 139 minus 0110 246 plus 55 plus 49 6280, 157 dash Alpha Charlie minus 040 minus 0170 248 plus 28 plus 57 5782, 158 dash Alpha Charlie plus 053 minus 0250 250 plus 02 plus 00 5113. End.
GUAM (REV 152)
241:42:25 Cunningham: Okay, Jack. Readback follows, and before that, we have just a couple more revs to go on the block data after this. If you get a chance, why don't you pass it up, and we will get it out of the way? Also, we would like that block data through REV 165. Over. [Long pause]
241:42:44 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
241:42:46 Cunningham: Readback follows: 153 dash 4 Alpha plus 354 minus 1610 243 plus 11 plus 05 3069, 154 dash 4 Charlie plus 163 minus 1610 244 plus 47 plus 45 2700, 155 dash Alpha Charlie minus 236 minus 0100 245 plus 22 plus 22 6914, 156 dash Alpha Charlie minus 139 minus 0110 246 plus 55 plus 49 6280, 157 dash Alpha Charlie minus 40 minus 0170 248 plus 28 plus 57 5782, 158 dash Alpha Charlie plus 053 minus 0250 250 plus 02 plus 00 5113. Over.
241:43:48 Swigert: Roger. That's got it. We are working on the remaining block data.
241:43:52 Cunningham (onboard): Okay. I...
241:43:53 Cunningham: We'd like one block, one rev past deorbit.
241:43:59 Swigert: Copy. We are about 50 seconds LOS Guam; Hawaii at 52.
241:44:05 Schirra: Roger.
Long comm break.
And this is Apollo Control. That wraps it up via Guam, at 241 hours, 45 minutes into the mission.
HAWAII through GUAYMAS (REV 152)
241:52:59 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. Standing by.
241:53:03 Schirra: Thank you. [Pause]
241:53:10 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
241:53:12 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
241:53:14 Schirra: Jack, I would like to give you an inventory of the film we have left, and I would like to have the people who are involved [garble] in the [garble] and the way they have them call up targets, too. I don't even know where we are going, and maybe we'll be able to get some pictures for them. We have 25 frames of 368 left and 364, and approximately 48 frames of Panatomic-X; this is black and white.
241:53:56 Swigert: Okay. Wally, you faded in and out on that. I did copy that you got about 20 frames of Panatomic-X left, but I didn't copy the number of frames in S0368.
241:54:08 Schirra: 25 frames in 368.
241:54:11 Swigert: 25 frames in 368, and you would like - as I understand it - for us to give you some desired targets of opportunity to photograph. Is that correct? [Long pause]
241:54:34 Schirra: Roger, It's only [garble] information.
241:54:39 Swigert: Okay, we will see if we can come up with some desired targets as you come around on the subsequent rev.
241:54:46 Schirra: We have got the film count at 15 frames 368, 48 frames Pan-X.
241:54:53 Swigert: Copy that.
Comm break.
Apollo Control, Houston here 241 hours, 55 minutes. We have acquisition via Hawaii. Here is the pass.
241:56:06 Swigert: Apollo 7, opposite Omni.
Comm break.
241:58:01 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7. [Long pause]
241:58:13 Swigert: Say again, 7.
241:58:16 Schirra: Roger. I think we can turn the power down to about half the SPS.
241:58:21 Swigert: Okay.
Long comm break.
242:05:40 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We are. about 1 minute LOS Guaymas, we pick up Tananarive at 44.
242:05:47 Schirra: Roger.
Very long comm break.
242:44:35 Cunningham (onboard): CDR, 10 clicks of water; LMP, 15 clicks of water.
TANANARIVE (REV 153)
242:44:58 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive, standing by. [Long pause]
242:45:20 Cunningham: Okay, Jack.
242:45:22 Swigert: Okay. Reading about 3 by, Walt.
242:45:25 Cunningham (onboard): We're always...
242:45:27 Cunningham: ... surprised that you could hear us at all here.
242:45:31 Swigert: Roger. Coming up over Guam, I'll pass you some of that information on terrain photographic targets. [Pause]
242:45:41 Cunningham: Roger. We are chlorinating now.
242:45:44 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
242:45:47 Cunningham: It took a long time.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 242 hours, 47 minutes into the flight. At Tananarive we have already done a brief tag up; I don't know how much communication will result and one new time of interest has been generated this morning; we are now estimating splash time in the morning that's based on a 164-1 nominal landing point. Time of 6:11 am, Central Daylight Time - 6:11. Here is the beginning o the Tananarive pass.
242:53:51 Swigert: 7, we are about 1 minute LOS Tananarive; we pick up the Mercury at 08.
Very long comm break.
242:53:55 Schirra (onboard): Roger.
MERCURY (REV 153)
243:08:53 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through the Mercury.
243:08:57 Cunningham: Yes, Jack.
243:09:00 Swigert: Okay. I have some of that information on photography here. [Pause]
243:09:11 Cunningham: Go ahead, Jack.
243:09:12 Swigert: Okay. At GET of 243:55, when you approach the west coast of South America, you can shoot the 368 - S0368 water to land; at 244:01 on the east coast of South America, you can shoot the S0368 land to water. And do you feel like you want to finish it up this pass, Wally, or do you want to continue on to the next rev? [Pause]
243:09:49 Schirra: We'll go on this rev.
243:09:51 Swigert: Okay. I'll try to give you some times on the - well, in the next rev, you'll hit the west coast of South America about 245:32 and the east coast about 245:37. And if it's hazy, don't shoot the 368 film, and we'll give you more targets later on. [Pause]
243:10:19 Schirra: We hear you.
243:10:21 Swigert: Okay. On the Pan-X, they are requesting on this rev here - on that 245:32 - a strip exposure, one exposure every 10 seconds from 245:32 until 245:37, all the way across South America to the water. And use the red filter on the Pan-X film. [Pause]
243:10:54 Cunningham: Is that for weather photography?
243:11:00 Swigert: Okay. It's a strip photography of the land; it's not really weather.
243:11:07 Schirra: You want red only and not red and green. Is that right?
243:11:09 Swigert: No, red only.
243:11:11 Schirra: Okay.
Comm break.
243:12:28 Cunningham: Jack, you still listening?
243:12:32 Swigert: Go ahead.
243:12:34 Cunningham: I've got the S0368 at 243:55; I think you said something about 244:01. [Pause]
243:12:48 Swigert: Okay. You'll hit the west coast of South America at 243:55, and you could take some pictures there, water to land. And then at 244:01 - that's what time you'll hit the east coast of South America and could take some S0368 land to water. Did I confuse you? [Pause]
243:13:21 Swigert: Opposite Omni, 7.
Long comm break.
243:17:30 Swigert: Apollo 7, we are 1 minute LOS Guam; we pick up Hawaii at 27.
Long comm break.
Apollo Control at 243 hours, 18 minutes over the Ship Mercury, we had the following communication.
HAWAII through HUNTSVILLE (REV 153)
243:27:XX Communications Technician: Hawaii AOS.
243:XX:XX Swigert: Hawaii. Houston. Do we have AOS yet?
243:33:40 Communications Technician: Affirmative. [Long pause]
243:33:53 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
243:33:54 Unidentifiable crewmember: Go ahead. [Pause]
243:33:58 Schirra (onboard): Go ahead.
243:34:00 Swigert: How's it going?
243:34:02 Unidentifiable crewmember: Roger. Loud and clear.
243:3X:XX Swigert: Roger. Got some late data for you here. Let me read it off.
243:3X:XX Unidentifiable crewmember: Just a second here; I'm just clearing up. We just took some movies of Walt getting in his suit.
243:3X:XX Swigert: Stand by one.
243:3X:XX Unidentifiable crewmember: Roger.
243:34:13 Unidentifiable crewmember: Okay. Go ahead.
243:3X:XX Slayton: Roger. Okay. I'd like to give you some data here on landing without helmets. Number 1: we don't have any. Number 2: we are expecting X-axis acceleration of 7.8 which, to give you a reference, is twice - little over twice what we had in Gemini, which was 3.4. Number 3: there is about a 30-percent probability - there again it is a function of winds and wave actions - that you can get a tripping action or a rotation on impact of about 200 degrees a second. The concern here is that you are probably going to get some head impact with either the headrest, the struts, the girth ring, or anything else that happens to be in the general area. In summary, we are concerned about getting some head damage if you impact without the helmet on. I think, on the other hand, we have some data that shows that you can impact without the helmet attached to the neckring and have reasonable protection; this has been done on a couple of sled tests. So our recommendation is that you come in with the gloves off; try to have the helmet in the vicinity of your head at least, probably, on it; this you are going to have to check out and see whether you can't reach up there and clear your ears by reaching your fingers in between the neckring and the helmet. And ideally, of course, you'd attach the helmet to the neckring, say around 2K before landing, or if you can't do that, the next best thing is to have it on your head. You got all that?
243:XX:XX Unidentifiable crewmember: Yes. We've fitted up our couches pretty well with the way our heads pretty well constrained - with food bags and tape, just to get our buffer. This is about all you can do with that. The helmet is - or our problem is - if we have to blow our nose; we are filled up with mucous, and we feel when they put some g on us, our sinuses are going to drain, as well. We just are going to have to play that one out, I guess, Deke, and if it gets bad, throw the helmet down.
243:3X:XX Slayton: Okay. That's probably true. I think you ought to start in with the helmet in any case...
243:3X:XX Unidentifiable crewmember: We are pretty well convinced we will pop our ears.
243:3X:XX Slayton: Okay. Roger. Okay. I think you understand the problem. You remember Gemini 3, where we ended up with a broken visor on Gus - and we may have a few other things like this on this one - we really aren't that smart about yet.
243:3X:XX Unidentifiable crewmember: Understand.
243:3X:XX Slayton: Okay. We'd hate to ruin that pretty profile on the landing.
243:3X:XX Unidentifiable crewmember: (Laughter) Okay. Well, give us - we understand the problem, and I think that's all we can do with it. And we'll work on it any way we can. Sure appreciate people working on it for us.
243:3X:XX Slayton: Okay. So you are going to try to come in with them on and crack them; so that'll solve it. Try to clear your nose then on the way down, right?
243:3X:XX Unidentifiable crewmember: Roger. It's really the case of solving [garble]. It's trying to blow our nose; we feel we are going to be coughing and possibly the stuff going in our throats when you put g on. I'm still blowing my nose right now, and I am two Actifed down the road.
243:3X:XX Slayton: Roger.
243:3X:XX Unidentifiable crewmember: And all we see there together - if we can blow our noses inside the helmet, that's going to be tricky. We'll have to play with it, I guess. We'll try it out a little bit early.
243:3X:XX Slayton: Okay. Fine.
243:3X:XX Unidentifiable crewmember: Roger. Thanks to you.

243:54:13 Schirra (onboard): [Garble] pulses.
243:57:14 Cunningham (onboard): Landmark 153 on magazine N, that's frames 42 and 43. The first one is of the coastline right about Antofagasta, just slightly north of Antofagasta, and the second picture was roughly in the same spot.
244:09:27 Cunningham (onboard): Magazine N, frames 44 and 45 were of the east coast of South America.
244:09:47 Cunningham (onboard): Frames 40 through 45, magazine N, on the east coast of South America in the vicinity of landmarks 153 and 155.
This is Apollo Control, Houston here at 244 hours, 11 minutes into the flight. And we are 15 hours, 27 minutes away from retrofire and the only item, two items now, on our Flight Plan that are very significant, one reads, "Initiate deorbit storage." Command Module Pilot Donn Eisele is well along into the sleep period, and about an hour from now the crew will do a ECS redundant component check, and take a careful look at their environmental control system. Some minutes ago we had a conversation with the crew over Hawaii. Deke Slayton discussed the helmet suit configuration for reentry with the crew. We have that tape and let's listen now.
This is Apollo Control, Houston. In the discussion you heard Deke Slayton reference a Gemini 3 incident. That was when John Young and Gus Grissom reentering the earth's atmosphere on their parachute, and the Gemini parachute, and when it went to 2 point suspension, which was the landing mode for Gemini, the spacecraft popped - moved violently, and the crew, the crew and the engineers planning the mission hadn't anticipated the violence of the movement, and the result was that Gus' head banged forward and hit the window on his side, the commander's side of the spacecraft, and cracked his visor. It didn't do any damage to Gus' person, but it did, it was an unexpected jolt and it was a severe one. Other Gemini pilots took a lesson from that and made sure their heads were restrained and that was the - that's the background on the Gemini reference in that conversation. At 244 hours, 18 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

244:24:32 Schirra: [Garble]. [Long pause]
244:24:49 Swigert: Wally, for a point of information, we are assuming that stowage will be nominal for retrofire. If you have any items that are stowed non-nominally, would you let us know for c.g. purposes? We would like to calculate c.g. rather closely.
244:25:14 Schirra: Understand [garble]. [Pause]
244:25:15 Schirra (onboard): We'll have the gloves and the suit stowage bag would also be [garble].

244:45:31 Evans: Roger.
Comm break.
244:47:58 Cunningham: Ron, I'm assuming you are recording down there. We're watching the sunrise come up. We're going to film it with ASA 1,000 film. At first, we saw some kind of a lightish gray with hardly any color, and then a very light blue, which turned into a little darker, like maybe a magenta. That blue at 1.8 degrees, we're starting to get the orange now, and it's just about light enough out there, where we can catch the clouds on the far horizon, maybe a hundred miles away being in profile. And I'm going to have to let go here in a second and start running the camera.
244:48:36 Evans: Roger. We have it recorded.
Comm break.
244:50:53 Cunningham: After the blue layers which had various layers within itself, with the light and dark alternating, we got our layer of yellow which is almost white, and then went on into an orange. At first, it's a fairly dull orange, and then it's getting very bright.
244:51:09 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
244:51:43 Cunningham: Ron, we ran out of film just as the sun broke the horizon.
244:51:47 Evans: Yes, yes.
244:51:50 Schirra: This is really working out, Ron. I'm running a light meter and holding the spacecraft.
244:51:54 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
244:51:59 Eisele: We went all the way from one-fiftieth of a second at two, moving on up while the sun was rising till we had a P22 and 1250, and I hope it turns out.
244:52:12 Evans: Roger. [Pause]

And I don't know which frame we started with on magazine U, but we ended up with mag - frame 33 on the eastern coast of South America.
245:39:07 Cunningham (onboard): Frame 48 and 49 - I am not sure if I taped that last on TRANSMIT or on the INTERCOM position, but at any rate, I am going to say that we stripped the southern part of South America, starting with some frame on magazine U, ending up with maga - with frame 33 on magazine U, on the eastern coast of South America.
245:39:38 Cunningham (onboard): Frames 48 and 49 of magazine N we're taking with S0368, but with a red filter still left on from the previous exercise, so they will not be very good - like no good.
245:39:56 Cunningham (onboard): Simultaneously, coming across the - at the same strip, we skip-mapped, using 16mm camera with S0368 film at one frame per second from the west coast of South America, across the Andes, and out on the east coast of South America.

This is Apollo Control at 246 hours, 08 minutes into the mission. During the news conference, Apollo 7 touched base at the Redstone and at Ascension. There was no conversation at Redstone other than an acknowledgment that we were standing by. There was a brief conversation at Ascension. Wally Schirra reported that he has powered down the SCS stabilization and control system. We'll bring you that tape now.

246:21:07 Cunningham: Hey, Ron, I've got two questions I'd like to have answers for, when you can get it.
246:21:12 Evans: Roger. Go.
246:21:13 Cunningham: One has to do with the fuel cells. We're presently planning to power up tomorrow morning somewhere in the 254th hour; that's so Donn can get some alignments out of the way before we get up. And fuel cell 2 has been going to worms a little faster each day. When I get up, it looks like it's climbing at a fairly healthy rate; I'd like to open circuit fuel cell 2 and put it back on the line at about T minus 45 minutes or T minus 30 minutes. That's the first point. The other one is on the primary evaporator. I overserviced that today, and I guess we don't know exactly how much water I got in it. It was on for more than 3 minutes though. And I wanted to know are we planning on bringing the primary evaporator back on the line or not, and I suspect we probably just as well not do it, and I'd like to just go ahead and change [garble] secondary coolant loop with radiator bypass and put the suit circuit on the secondary coolant loop. Over.
246:22:30 Evans: Roger. Say the last on your primary evaporator, after are we planning to use it, everything after that.
246:22:40 Cunningham: Okay. The details are down there already on - I overserviced the evaporator. I guess what I'd prefer to do instead of risking any possible problems with the steam duct, I would like to just go ahead and activate secondary coolant loop with the radiator bypass and put the suit circuit secondary coolant loop and run a primary loop just on radiators.
246:23:07 Evans: Roger. Copy your comments; will advise.
246:23:12 Cunningham: Okay.
246:23:15 Cunningham: I checked all the command module RCS engine temps about an hour ago. They're already at high loads; we don't plan on heating the command module RCS engines.
246:23:28 Evans: Roger. We concur on RCS engine heaters; that is, it's not necessary to heat.

246:26:19 Cunningham: Hey, Ron, if you're still there, can you give me my present battery status? We did a charge battery 2 today, battery B.

This is Apollo control at 246 hours, 28 minutes, Mercury has LOS. During this pass Walt Cunningham had a couple of questions, one concerning the operations of fuel cell 2 tomorrow, the other concerning the possibility of taking the primary evaporator off the line tomorrow, using radiators only on that loop and activating the secondary coolant loop. We hope to have the answer to his question over the Redstone. The Redstone acquires at 246 hours, 52 minutes. This is mission control, Houston.

248:27:57 Eisele: Say, Ron, we've still got a little film up here I'd like to use, and I was wondering if you guys would give me 3 or 4 pounds of fuel so I could go ahead and use it up during the next two or three revs, 3 or 4 pounds of RCS fuel, that is.
248:28:15 Evans: Roger. Stand by. Little garbled there, I understand you want 3 or k pounds of RCS fuel to use.
248:28:22 Eisele: Yes, see how we stand on RCS fuel [garble]. I'll get the fuel reading anyhow. [Pause]
248:28:35 Evans: 7, Houston. Opposite Omni.
248:28:38 Eisele: Roger. [Long pause]
248:28:56 Evans: 7, Houston. How's the voice now?
248:29:00 Eisele: Say again.
248:29:01 Evans: Roger. Loud and clear now, Donn. If you can repeat what you were saying -
248:29:06 Eisele: Oh. Roger. I was asking for an RCS fuel quantity reading for our chart, and also asked - negotiating for a few pounds of attitude fuel so I can finish off our camera film.
248:29:21 Evans: Roger. I understand. Stand by on both counts. [Pause]
248:29:33 Eisele: While you're at it, maybe you can dream up some - or whip up some targeting for pictures. [Pause]
248:29:48 Evans: Donn, we'll see you at Mercury next rev, and we'll have the answers available for both at that time.
248:29:56 Eisele: Roger. Say it again, Walt - Ron.
248:29:58 Evans: Roger. We'll give you the answers to both questions at Mercury on the next rev there.
248:30:04 Eisele: Okay.
248:30:06 Evans: But it looks favorable at this time.
248:30:10 Eisele: Okay. [Pause]
248:30:17 Eisele: Oh, Ron, I'll give you a film inventory. We have a few frames of Hasselblad color film 368 and a couple of magazines of 16 mm for the Maurer camera.
248:30:31 Evans: Roger.
248:30:32 Eisele: I'd like to shoot those out the window at either targets of opportunity or any particular targets that you might be able to give me, that is, you know, at a time when we're going over a particular item of interest.
248:30:43 Evans: Roger.
248:30:44 Eisele: And we also have some Panatomic-X left.
248:30:48 Evans: Check.
248:30:50 Eisele: I think we've got about 25 frames of Pan-X and, oh, I don't know, six or eight of 368, and I'd say two rolls of camera - of movie film.
248:31:03 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
248:31:25 Eisele: Oh, and while you're at it, could you get me a map update also?

This is Apollo Control at 251 hours, 49 minutes. Redstone has LOS. The flight controller team lead Gerry Griffin is in the process of relieving the Gene Kranz team. To recap the activities of this shift picked up in revolution 154 over the tracking ship Mercury. The crew was doing sunrise photography at that time. Walt Cunningham gave a rather colorful description of the sunrise. Completed an environmental control system redundant point check over Hawaii on that rev. And over Ascension on rev 155, Wally Schirra reported shutting down the SCS for the evening. That same rev over the Mercury, Walt Cunningham came up with a couple of questions he wanted some advice from the ground on. One was on fuel cell 2 which the condenser temperatures have been running a little higher than normal. He wondered about taking fuel cell 2 off the line if it got too warm in the morning, letting it cool down, and putting it back on the line just before the de-orbit burn. He also advised that he had over serviced the primary evaporator today, and thought it might be a good idea to use the secondary coolant loop for the suits circuit, and use radiators only on the primary loop. We haven't passed any answers up yet on either of these items. The EECOM officer and his assistants are still in the process of studying them, and the answers will be passed up prior to the time they'll be needed. We got a battery status over Ascension the start of REV 156. Batteries looked good. Over the Mercury on that rev all of the crew talked to Gene Kranz, and expressed their appreciation for the support of his team during this mission. Donn Eisele was awake, and at this time Schirra and Cunningham started their sleep period. And that same revolution over the Redstone, Donn Eisele asked for permission to use a few pounds of RCS propellant. He wants to use up as much unexposed film as possible, and he asked for suggestions on areas that he might photograph. He got permission to use the film and some suggested areas over Ascension at the beginning of REV 157. REV 157 over the Mercury we had a fuel cell O2 purge. Over the Redstone on that pass we powered up the command module computer, checked the navigation vectors. They looked very good, and the computer was powered down. We're now about to end the 158th revolution. At the start of this rev we've got a read-out on pyrotechnic batteries. And just now over the Redstone we advised Donn Eisele that a cabin cold soak which had been listed as an optional activity would not be necessary. He reported the cabin temperature at 65 degrees. He said it was very comfortable. During this shift the decision was also made to keep the primary recovery area 164 dash 1 at its present coordinates 27 degrees 38 minutes north, 64 degrees 10 minutes west. There had been some discussion of moving it slightly because of a front, but that will not cause a problem so that primary will not be moved. Present ephemeris of the spacecraft, apogee 228.5 nautical miles, perigee 90 nautical miles. Showing an orbital period of 90 minutes 28 seconds, weight in orbit 24,021 pounds. Next station to acquire will be Antigua at 251 minutes - 251 hours, 59 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.

253:34:35 Pogue: Stand by, Donn. [Long pause]
253:34:47 Pogue: Hey, Donn, it will be over Antigua the next pass; be about one hour and a half. [Pause]
253:34:56 Eisele: Okay.

253:41:19 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Antigua; Canary at 44. [Pause]
253:41:28 Eisele: Roger.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 253 hours, 41 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We will lose acquisition at Antigua in a very few seconds and we will pick up acquisition at Canary Islands at 253:44 about two and a half minutes from now. We're now beginning the 160th revolution. After this revolution we will have three more to go before deorbit and re-entry. We'll stand by now for the Canary Island pass.

Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, 253 hours, 54 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We have lost acquisition at the Canary Islands. And in a few seconds, we will lose acquisition at Madrid. Our next point of contact will be Carnarvon at 254:21. The last couple of hours as we said before have been exceptionally quiet - the quietest during the mission for a light period of time. All goes well with the spacecraft at this time. At 253:54, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control; 254 hours, 20 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We are now approaching the Carnarvon tracking station; let's listen in.

254:24:53 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
254:24:56 Eisele: Bill, I'm just going to brief you for something to do up here. Wally and Walt are still asleep. I've got some of the spacecraft stowed - that that I could get at without disturbing them - and I'm going to be putting my suit on here pretty shortly. At the beginning of the next night pass, I'm going to try to get P51 accomplished so I can get a leg up on the whole time line. That way, when your update comes up later in the pass, if there's time, I'd like to get P52 done, or I might wait until the next one.
254:25:27 Pogue: Okay. Right. We'll - we have the REFSMMAT, NAV load, and the target load ready for the Antigua pass, and that will be at 08 past the hour.
254:25:42 Eisele: Okay. Zero eight?
254:25:43 Pogue: Right.
254:25:45 Eisele: Roger.
254:25:48 Pogue: So that will be ready and waiting if you - oh, that'll give you - let's see, that won't give you too much of that night pass actually.
254:26:00 Eisele: I'd like to do the P51 before that, you see.
254:26:03 Pogue: Okay. If you could - if we could get through with that before 08, then we could get those three loads up to you and have that done and away with.
254:26:13 Eisele: Yes, that's a good idea, Bill. Okay. Fine.
254:26:16 Pogue: Okay. Thank you.
254:26:18 Eisele: I think we can get it all done but maybe the fine aliment before they get up.
254:26:22 Pogue: Okay. [Long pause]

254:31:38 Eisele: Roger. Go, Bill.
254:31:40 Pogue: Right. Donn, I have a little discussion here on a couple of items. I would like to make a couple of recommendations. First, for entry, we would like all three fuel cells on line. And secondly, we would like to operate the coolant loops primary without the evaporator secondary loop in bypass with the evaporator on. [Pause]
254:32:15 Eisele: Roger. Understand. You want the fuel cells on, all three formed for entry?
254:32:19 Pogue: Affirmative.
254:32:20 Eisele: And on the coolant, you want to run the primary system with the evaporator shut down? And on the secondary, bypassing the radiators with the secondary water boiler on it?
254:32:32 Pogue: That's affirmative; and, of course, if the secondary evaporator quits, well, you can switch to primary evaporator and try it. [Pause]
254:32:48 Eisele: Roger. Understand.
254:32:50 Pogue: Okay.
254:32:52 Eisele: Thank you.

254:35:08 Eisele: Fine, Bill.
254:35:09 Pogue: Okay. One final item. This secondary radiator - we'd like to activate that at 258 Hours. [Pause]
254:35:24 Eisele: You're going to do what?
254:35:26 Pogue: I'm sorry - secondary evaporator at 258.
254:35:31 Eisele: Oh, okay. Secondary evaporator at 258 hours. Understand.
254:35:34 Pogue: Roger.
254:35:36 Eisele: I got it in my log here.
254:35:38 Pogue: Thank you. And we're coming up on 1 minute LOS Honeysuckle; we'll have Redstone at 50.
254:35:47 Eisele: Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, 254 hours, 37 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We're anticipating the Redstone Tracking Station acquisition time at 254:50, some 13 minutes from now. During that pass we heard astronaut Eisele talking to CapCom Pogue here in the Control Center indicating that Schirra and Cunningham were asleep. He also indicated he had stowed everything he could without disturbing Schirra and Cunningham. He was shortly going to put on his spacesuit. He said at the beginning of the next pass he would do a P51 and a P52. The P51 of course being the inertial measuring unit orientation program. And the P52 program being the inertial measuring alignment. Astronaut Pogue indicated that for entry the three fuel cells should be put on the line - all three of them that the primary coolant loop should be on with the evaporator shut down and the secondary bypass radiators with the water boilers on. And the secondary evaporator should be on at 258 hours. At 254 hours, 38 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control; 254 hours, 49 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We're coming up now on acquisition with the Redstone tracking ship on the 160th revolution; let's listen in.

This is Apollo Control; 254 hours, 58 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We are completing our 160th revolution very shortly, at that point we'll have three more to go. At this time, it is 04 hours, 41 minutes and 01 second to the initiation of the retrofiring of SPS engine for reentry. Our next point of contact will be Merritt Island facility in Florida. They should have acquisition at 255 hours, 06 minutes into the mission. At 254:58, this is Apollo Control.
255:04:33 Eisele (onboard): Getting gyro-torquing angles, 00001, 00362, 00612. This is preliminary P52 for deorbit. We do not deorbit at this time, however. Time is 255 hours, 4 minutes.
This is Apollo Control; 255 hours, 06 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We have a retrofire time that was just passed to us; retrofire time now stands at 259 hours, 39 minutes 16 seconds, which would be 5:42:01 Central Daylight Time. We now are coming up with acquisition at Merritt Island, Florida tracking facility; let's listen in.

256:00:12 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
256:00:15 Eisele: Go.
256:00:16 Swigert: Okay, Donn. On fuel cell 2, there's been a lot of discussion on that down here, and they feel that with the trends that they've seen that the TCE should top out about 185, and they would just as soon leave it on the line to keep from any switching transients there. And you shouldn't reach any higher than 185 at retrofire. [Pause]
256:00:45 Eisele: Okay. We're reading 181 right now.
256:00:48 Swigert: Okay. That's about - you're about 4 degrees higher than the actual there. Our value down here now is 177.
256:00:57 Eisele: Okay.

HONEYSUCKLE (REV 161)
256:11:57 Swigert: Apollo 7. Houston. One minute LOS Honeysuckle; we'll pick Guaymas at 36.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 256 hours, 12 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We are losing acquisition at Honeysuckle, anticipating Guaymas at 2536. During our Carnarvon pass we heard astronaut Eisele indicating that Schirra and Cunningham were eating and the spacecraft. And Eisele is presently in his suit - in his lumpy suit, as he put it. The whole team offered congratulations and the Apollo 7 crew responded and send regards and talked to the flight director, Griffin. Astronaut Swigert is now on as CapCom as the pime came - the launch team comes on duty here at the Control Center. Astronaut Swigert indicated fuel cell number 2 is close to the master alarm but that they should not be concerned about it on board. Eisele came back indicating that Schirra would possibly like to take fuel cell number 2 off the line for now and let the temperatures go down and put it on the line prior to re-entry. And astronaut Swigert, the CapCom, indicated no that it won't reach more than 185 degrees during retro fire and therefore there is no concern. At 256 hours, 14 minutes into the mission this is Apollo Control."
256:17:39 Cunningham (onboard): Hello. How do you read?
256:30:37 Cunningham (onboard): [Garble] gyro-torquing angles, minus 1.84, plus 858, minus 2.171. [Garble] P52 alignment [garble] over [garble].

256:38:26 Cunningham: Are you there, and are you familiar with the fuel cell performance on yesterday's burn?
256:38:31 Swigert: Roger, Walt. I am.
256:38:34 Cunningham: Okay. I guess if it goes on up to 200 and we're in a retro countdown, I'm not going to sweat it anyway. I'm going to let it run on. I guess - it seems to me if we went ahead and opencircuited here for the next hour and a half, we'd - maybe next 2 hours, a little longer, put it on around minus 30 or minus 45 minutes, we'd have little or no problem with it.
256:38:58 Swigert: Roger. I don't think from what we have been talking about that you'll have to worry. That is, we'll get up over 200; and if it does, we have been given the GO to let it go ahead and go over 200.
256:39:15 Cunningham: Roger. That's my intention.
256:39:17 Swigert: Okay. We concur.
256:39:23 Cunningham: It's a shame we can't get that one back and take a look at it.
256:39:26 Swigert: I agree. [Pause]
256:39:35 Swigert: From all the data, we'll have a pretty good idea of what it is.

256:58:34 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, at 245 hours and 56 minutes, we did our last - put our last fresh canister in. And it in the next hour or so, we are going to recycle number 1 back in.
256:58:48 Swigert: Okay. Fine. Could you bring me up to date on -
256:58:52 Cunningham: We sure had a square unfilled there.
256:58:56 Swigert: Okay. You're right.

256:59:05 Swigert: It kind of does. Could you bring me up to date on the - how you're coming on stowage?
256:59:11 Cunningham: Roger. Stowage is all but complete. We took the three biobelts and stowed them in the fecal canister where we have been taking out the fresh fecal bag. And we're going to be getting unsuited on the water as soon as we get a chance on there, assuming we all come out of this in a nice smooth shape. And we have two temporary stowage bags up with the coveralls in the temporary stowage bags.
256:59:48 Swigert: Okay.
256:59:49 Cunningham: Everything else is stowed in its nominal place.
256:59:52 Swigert: Okay. You got the gloves stowed and helmets on?
256:59:57 Cunningham: The helmets we don't have on. We're going to try the helmets. It's our general feeling now that we probably will not be wearing those helmets. We're going to make one more stab when we get the couch down to the launch position and see what we can do about clearing our ears. I'm probably in better shape than the other guys, and I'm not too sure about my ears. By the way Wally and Donn talked, they are in a little bit worse shape than I am. And if they go with their helmets off, that's the way I'll go, too. We don't want to get the suit loop too confused, as to which way it is supposed to act.
257:00:30 Swigert: Okay.
257:00:34 Cunningham: There are a few items still left to be stowed and put in shape. That's like the data file, the temporary stowage items, the F - Is there an F item, Donn? F1 and F2 still have a couple of small items then that we are going to have put back in the right place when Wally gets the couch. And he is about suited, and he will be on COMM shortly.
257:01:04 Swigert: Okay, Walt. How about the oxygen mask? Are they put away?
257:01:09 Cunningham: They are all stowed.
257:01:10 Swigert: Okay.
257:01:12 Cunningham: Helmets are - if we do not wear the helmets, the helmets will be tied down at the foot of the couch in front of each guy's couch. They will be below the level of the canisters down there. So it's out of the couch envelope.
257:01:26 Slayton: Okay. We're not concerned about hurting the helmets. We're concerned about your heads.
257:01:34 Cunningham: Roger. We understand, Deke, and we're trying to make a go of it all the way with the helmets. We haven't gotten to the position where we can try them on in the couch in the boost position yet. However, we do feel that we have - if we go with the helmets off, we'll have pretty damned good protection set up around us. [Long pause]
257:02:20 Swigert: 7, we're about 1 minute LOS Canaries; we'll pick up Tananarive about 19.
257:02:28 Cunningham: Right. Good morning, Jack.
257:02:29 Schirra (onboard): Good morning, Jack. Houston, Apollo 7.
257:02:34 Eisele: Houston, your -
257:02:38 Swigert: Go ahead. Donn.
257:02:40 Schirra (onboard): This is Wally, just saying good morning.
257:02:42 Swigert: You've taken the last Actifed at 257 here.
257:02:48 Eisele: Talking about Actifed, we all took it.
257:02:50 Swigert: Okay. Real fine. [Pause]
257:02:58 Eisele: We've still got our nausea pills left to take.
257:03:02 Swigert: Okay. The carrier reports wave height 1 foot out there.
257:03:07 Schirra: That sounds almost good enough for the Air Force. [Pause]
257:03:14 Eisele: We thought a little bit of chop might break the landing just a little bit.
257:03:20 Eisele: You can tell the carrier to watch out; we'll be coming down his stack. [Pause]
257:03:29 Eisele: What's the carrier call?
257:03:32 Swigert: Carrier call is Essex. [Pause]
257:03:36 Eisele (onboard): That's the name - is that the call, too?
257:03:39 Eisele: How could you [garble] O2?
257:03:42 Swigert: I'll be giving you a rundown on weather and call signs as we go a little bit further here.
257:03:49 Schirra: Jack, do you read CDR?
257:03:51 Swigert: Roger. Five-by, Wally. We're just about to lose you.
Very long comm break.
TANANARIVE (REV 162)
257:19:13 Swigert: Houston through Tananarive. [Long pause]
257:19:16 Schirra (onboard): Roger. Loud and clear.
257:19:19 Schirra (onboard): Houston, do you read?
257:19:58 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Tananarive; we'll he coming to you at Carnarvon at 30 with an entry update.
257:20:09 Schirra: Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 257 hours, 31 minutes. We've just tagged up on Carnarvon.
CARNARVON (REV 162)
257:30:19 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Long pause]
257:30:53 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
257:30:58 Cunningham: Ready to copy entry update.
257:31:02 Swigert: Okay. First, Walt, we'd like you to turn your H2 heaters and fans on for both tanks to the ON position for a few minutes bore so we can bump up the H2 pressure.
257:31:15 Cunningham: Going now.
257:31:17 Swigert: Okay. Then I'll give you the entry update.
257:31:23 Cunningham: Ready to copy.
257:31:25 Swigert: Okay one -
257:31:26 Cunningham: Do you want fans and heaters ON?
257:31:28 Swigert: Fans and heaters ON.
257:31:33 Cunningham: For hydrogen?
257:31:34 Swigert: Hydrogen, right. [Pause]
257:31:41 Cunningham: Fuel cell is still climbing, 184 on my gage.
257:31:45 Swigert: Yes, we're considering open circuit. We want to get a few data - a little bit of data flow here before we make any decision.
257:31:56 Schirra: We'll take 10-degree flaps, too.
257:31:59 Swigert: Roger. Okay. You ready on the entry update, Walt?
257:32:04 Cunningham: Read it.
257:32:05 Swigert: Okay. 164 dash 1 Alpha 190 000 042 000 10635 25954 16 plus 20 plus 2763 minus 06417 16 plus 49 minus 02846 55 slash 55 19 plus 22 17 plus 02 19 plus 58 24 plus 12 043 minus 18 slash plus 40. [Pause]
257:33:36 Cunningham: Roger. Jack, readback follows: 164 dash 1 Able 190 000 042 000 10635 25954 16 20 plus 2763 minus 06417 16 49 minus 02846 55 55 19 22 17 02 19 58 24 12 043 minus 18 slash plus 4 zero. And I have a question on your maneuver update remarks.
257:34:21 Swigert: Okay. Stand by. Go ahead.
257:34:28 Cunningham: Roger. Down at the remarks is SCS 259, and I've got written in here 21 on the PAD. Shouldn't that probably be 41 if this is for SCS burn backup?
257:34:41 Swigert: That was for the sextant star not visible after 259 plus 21 plus 00?
257:34:48 Cunningham: Okay. Sextant star 259 plus 21. Thank you.
257:34:52 Swigert: Okay.
257:34:55 Cunningham: And the entry update readback was correct?
257:34:58 Swigert: Perfect. [Pause]
257:35:02 Cunningham: Got to do something right. [Long pause]
257:35:17 Swigert: Okay. Walt, We're recommending Omni A for the burn and Omni C for post SEP.
257:35:24 Cunningham: Understand. Wilco.
257:35:26 Swigert: And you'll be Simplex A for reentry, and -
257:35:31 Cunningham: That's affirmed.
257:35:32 Swigert: And cabin fans, that's a crew option. You can have no fans, one fan, or two fans. Your choice.
257:35:41 Cunningham: We'll have no fans; however, I am a little bit I interested in bringing on the secondary loops a little sooner. The suit is a little bit warm.
257:35:47 Swigert: Okay. Stand by. [Long pause]
257:36:38 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, on the maneuver PAD, the velocity counter setting is different from the - what showed up on the DSKY with the Delta-V by 19.5 feet per second, I think, and you have Delta-V tailoff at 19.
257:36:59 Swigert: Okay. Stand by, Walt. We'll get a reading on that. [Long pause]
257:37:26 Swigert: Okay. Walt, on your last question on the Delta-V counter: that 19 feet a second is our value for the adjusted tailoff and what you should be reading in the Delta-V counter after the burn is over.
257:37:41 Cunningham: I understand that, Jack, but the Delta-VC that you set on is generally different from the G&N reading by that tailoff amount. [Pause]
257:37:54 Swigert: Right. Okay. I guess I missed it, Walt. Why don't you go over it again? I guess I missed your question. [Pause]
257:38:05 Cunningham: Okay. In doing P30, in one of the displays, it shows Delta-V, and we set the Delta-V counter to be equal to Delta-V minus the Delta-V at tailoff. In this case, from your maneuver PAD, they were different by 19.5 feet per second, which would indicate that there was 19.5 feet per second tailoff. I commented on it at the time because it seemed kind of large and now the Delta-V at tailoff on the entry PAD is 19.
257:38:41 Swigert: Okay, Walt.
257:38:44 Cunningham: It's small point, but I'd like to know which is which in case I have to update my entry chart.
257:38:49 Swigert: Okay. We'll discuss that. We're about 1 minute LOS Carnarvon. You want to turn up S-band so we can get Honeysuckle?
257:38:58 Cunningham: Okay. [Long pause]
257:39:29 Swigert: Okay. Walt, on that question there, what has happened is the Delta-V tailoff coming out of the CMC could be off by as much as 1 foot per second because we didn't update it yesterday. We chose not to do it because we felt it was accurate enough. [Pause]
257:39:52 Cunningham: Okay. Then I will update my entry chart based on how it differs from 19 feet per second. Is that correct?
257:39:59 Swigert: That is correct.
257:40:01 Cunningham: Understand.
Long comm break.
HONEYSUCKLE (REV 162)
257:43:18 Swigert: Apollo 7. Opposite Omni.
257:43:27 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
257:43:29 Schirra: Go ahead, Chuck.
257:43:30 Swigert: Okay. Wally, we'd like to have you turn the H2 fans and heaters off now. [Pause]
257:43:40 Schirra: That's done; OFF not AUTO.
257:43:43 Swigert: Roger, OFF, O-F-F. And, Walt, we'd like to have you open circuit fuel cell 2; our plans are to probably bring it back on line over the States.
257:43:55 Schirra: Understand. Welcome to the club.
257:44:01 Swigert: Okay. We'd like to have you purge all fuel cells. First, make an O2 purge on all fuel cells before the secondary loop activation. [Pause]
257:44:12 Cunningham: Okay. I'll go ahead and purge them now so that I can purge 2 before I take it off.
257:44:17 Swigert: Okay. We concur.
257:44:19 Cunningham: Roger. [Long pause]
257:45:11 Swigert: And, Walt, on your question on the secondary loop activation: you can bring that loop online any time after you've done the O2 purge of the fuel cells.
Comm break.
257:47:00 Swigert: Apollo 7, we're about 1 minute LOS Honeysuckle; we pick up the Huntsville at 04. [Pause]
257:47:09 Schirra: Roger.
Very long comm break.
Apollo Control here. That fuel cell temperature climbed about a hundred and eighty nine degrees. We've seen it higher in the flight but for various reasons, mainly a look-see, a chance to give the cell some time to cool down. That's why they decided to take it off line and let it cool down before they reach the stateside area again. At 257 hours, 47 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 258 hours, 04 minutes into the flight. We are due to acquire here just any second via Guaymas; via the ship Huntsville first and then break into Guaymas, let's tune in and listen.
HUNTSVILLE (REV 162)
258:05:07 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through the Huntsville. Standing by.
258:05:12 Schirra: Roger. Loud and clear.

GUAYMAS through BERMUDA (REV 162)
258:11:45 Swigert: Apollo 7, opposite Omni.
Comm break.
258:13:36 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
258:13:41 Schirra: Go ahead.
258:13:43 Swigert: Okay. Walt, we're ready to bring fuel cell 2 back on the line.
258:13:50 Cunningham: It's been setting down; both buses have been down around 26.3 volts, Jack. It seems to me it would be a little safer if we waited another hour or so to bring it on. What do you think?
258:14:11 Swigert: We're mulling it over here. [Pause]
258:14:20 Cunningham: Fuel cells 2 and 3 are both heating up. They should be picking up. Well, we ought to go ahead and turn it on, I guess. We keep triggering the main bus undervoltage down there.
258:14:32 Swigert: Okay. We concur.
258:14:35 Cunningham: Okay. Incidentally, it started happening when I turned the secondary coolant loop pump on; it was just enough to pull it down.
258:14:42 Swigert: Roger. We were watching it. [Pause]
258:14:55 Cunningham: It's back on the line.
258:14:56 Swigert: Okay. We're watching it.
Comm break.
Apollo Control here. Fuel cell number 2 as you heard it back on the line, its temperature when we took it off the line. Back at Australia it was about 189 degrees, it's now 169 degrees compared to fuel cells 1 and 3. Both of which read - a temperature of 163. Fuel cells starts its gentle climb up again, it's prone to run a little warmer than the other two. It has been throughout the flight. The load sharing is quite evenly distributed around 33 percent. And the amps are shown also in equal distribution - 27 to 28 amps from each cell. In a very few minutes we'll start what might in this Olympic year be called the gun lap. The final lap and if it is anything like some past manned flight - we can expect the crew to be giving a sign off to the ground stations as they pass over them. You heard some of that activity last night. As the crew said good-bye and thanked the ship Mercury, the Guam station, the Redstone, other stations that will not be seen today. Flight Director is asking his positions. Now for any last minute instruction, to speak now or be quiet. And for the record, the Flight Director has said we know of no more configuration requirements. Here is the COM again.
GUAYMAS through BERMUDA (REV 163)
258:17:15 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
258:17:18 Schirra: Go ahead.
258:17:20 Swigert: Wally, generally how is your configuration, stowage configuration for reentry now?
258:17:26 Schirra: Okay. We're all stowed. We have the helmets stowed below our feet, and we're rigged up; we're not strapped in.
258:17:34 Swigert: Okay. Are the O2 masks stowed someplace where they might be accessible in case of RCS injection on the chutes? [Pause]
258:17:44 Schirra: They are at the nominal point.
258:17:47 Swigert: Okay.
258:17:50 Schirra: And tell everybody to stop wringing their hands. We're happy. We've practiced this quite a few times.
258:18:04 Swigert: Okay. [Pause]
258:18:11 Swigert: Practiced what?
Comm break.
258:19:16 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
258:19:18 Schirra: Go ahead.
258:19:19 Swigert: Okay. Walt and Wally and Donn, I'll give you 164 dash weather. I'll update it. The weather is generally good; 1500 foot broken, 10 miles on the vis, winds are two ten at 15 knots, wave height is 4 feet. You've got a carrier on station, three helicopters, and two rescue aircraft. [Pause]
258:19:44 Schirra: And what's the carrier's call?
258:19:46 Swigert: Essex.
258:19:49 Schirra: They have a call, Jack, in lieu of a name. [Pause]
258:19:58 Swigert: Stand by, Wally.
258:20:00 Schirra: Roger. Like we are Apollo 7, they are - they can put names on them.
258:20:07 Swigert: Okay. Stand by. [Long pause]
258:20:25 Swigert: Okay. Wally, the call sign for the carrier is just the Essex. Your rescue aircraft are Kenby Rescue 1 and Kenby Rescue 2, and the helicopters are Recovery 1, 2, and 3.
258:20:42 Schirra: Very good.
258:20:43 Swigert: And I'll give you an update on the weather farther along. [Pause]
258:20:50 Schirra: It's a special case if the carrier is using her name. [Pause]
258:20:56 Swigert: Roger.
Comm break.
258:21:58 Schirra: Jack, you read?
258:22:00 Swigert: Go ahead, Wally.
258:22:02 Schirra: I might add we all feel very good and chipper up here. We all got a lot of good sleep; we're well hydrated and had a lot of food, so there's not much more to do and let the computer work for us.
258:22:12 Swigert: Okay. I think we're all the same down here.
258:22:15 Schirra: Very good. [Long pause]
This is Apollo Control, Houston. That will wrap up the conversation for this pass as the crew makes additional final checks on their stowage list. We're getting some information on one of the rescue aircraft - Kindley Kindley rescue 1 - I think I heard had some which took off very long ago. And had some engine trouble shortly after take off, has returned to Kindley and will be replaced. Its replacement apparently has not yet left but - we'll give you more information on that as we get lt. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
258:23:11 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
258:23:14 Swigert: Go ahead, Wally.
258:23:15 Schirra: Are we over the recovery force now?
258:23:18 Swigert: Just about, Wally.
258:23:20 Schirra: We heard a call sign, Lucky Strike. [Pause]
258:23:26 Swigert: Okay. Wally, we got you for another 4½ minutes here.
258:23:30 Schirra: Very good. We aren't having any luck with the sextant star yet; it's been behind the Earth. We'll try a daylight pass; and up to about retro minus 40 minutes, we'll give it a go. After that, we'll have to forget it.
258:23:44 Swigert: Okay.
258:23:47 Slayton: Apollo 7, Houston.
258:23:48 Schirra: Go ahead, Deke.
258:23:50 Slayton: Roger. Did you conclude you could not get helmets on? Is that the problem?
258:23:54 Schirra: No, we can get them on; we can't get them off.
258:23:57 Slayton: Okay. But the mode we wanted was to have them on without being latched down to the neckring. [Pause]
258:24:04 Schirra: Deke, I can't get my hand in there, besides a handkerchief, and we're not at all safely braced for landing. We'll evaluate as carefully as we can. [Pause]
258:24:17 Slayton: Okay. I think you ought to clearly understand there is absolutely no experience at all with landing without the helmet on.
258:24:24 Schirra: And there is no experience with the helmet either on that one.
258:24:27 Slayton: That one we've got a lot of experience with, yes.
258:24:30 Schirra: If we had an open visor, I might go along with that. [Pause]
258:24:35 Slayton: Okay. I guess you better be prepared to discuss in some detail when we land why we haven't got them on. I think you're too late now to do much about it.
258:24:43 Schirra: That's affirmative. I don't think anybody down there has worn the helmets as much as we have.
258:24:50 Slayton: Yes.
258:24:51 Schirra: We tried them on this morning.
258:24:53 Slayton: Understand that. The only thing we're concerned about is the landing. We couldn't care less about the reentry. But it's your neck, and I hope you don't break it.
258:25:06 Schirra: Thank you, babe.
258:25:10 Slayton: Over and out.
258:25:13 Schirra: Say again. [Long pause]
258:25:33 Slayton: Houston out.

258:33:20 Schirra: Go ahead. Houston.
258:33:21 Swigert: Okay. Walt. You can turn the SPS line heaters off now. We're showing a VALVE TEMP of 60 which is okay.
258:33:30 Cunningham: Roger. Turn them off. [Long pause]
258:34:07 Schirra: Houston, this is Apollo 7, I'll be prepared to talk about the whole mission when we get back.

258:37:12 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
Very long comm break.
And, that will wrap up any communication possibilities via Canaries. Be back up in about 6 or 7 minutes through Tananarive
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 258 hours, 51 minutes into the flight and just any second we should get our last tag up through Tananarive.

258:52:22 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read through Tananarive? Over.
258:52:25 Swigert: Roger. Walt, we're reading about four-by.
258:52:29 Cunningham: Okay. We'll come up over Carnarvon. We have SECS LOGIC down; we're standing by for a pyro ARM; and I assume that you'll insure that we leave Carnarvon with a clean tape for reentry, and if you don't, would you let me know so I can COMMAND RESET and get it going before we deorbit?
258:52:44 Swigert: Okay. Will do. [Long pause]
258:53:19 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
258:53:22 Cunningham: Go ahead, Jack.
258:53:23 Swigert: Okay. Walt, we didn't see you initiate the DAP for the VERB 46 there. [Pause]
258:53:31 Cunningham: I did initiate the DAP.
258:53:34 Swigert: Okay. That's all we wanted.
258:53:36 Cunningham: Chute or what? Send another one. I went to DAP right after P30 instead of VERB 46. I'm checking. [Long pause]
258:53:51 Swigert: Okay. We just didn't see it and wanted to confirm.
258:53:54 Cunningham: That's good, but it has been set.

259:06:33 Swigert: Stand by. We want to look at it here.
259:06:36 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause]
259:07:19 Swigert: Apo]lo 7, you are GO for a pyro ARM.
259:07:24 Schirra: Thank you, Jack. [Pause]
259:07:32 Cunningham: Pyro ARM.
259:07:33 Schirra: Pyro A ON, pyro B ON. [Long pause]
259:08:13 Cunningham: One ON and two ON. [Long pause]
259:08:33 Schirra: That's kind of a lot of fun to hear that.
259:08:39 Cunningham: Roger. We've pressurized our command module RCS. We seem to have had a chattering regulator for awhile.
259:08:46 Swigert: Roger.
259:08:47 Schirra: She's in compression.
259:08:53 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
259:08:54 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
259:08:56 Schirra: Did you ever hear a Model A on a cold day. That's what it sounded like.
259:09:00 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
259:09:06 Schirra: We could hear it go through the lines. We're happy with the CM RCS.
259:09:10 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
259:09:20 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7. Do you monitor our helium pressures on rings 1 and 2?
259:09:25 Swigert: Affirmative.
259:09:27 Cunningham: Roger. We're reading 35; checklist calls for 4000. [Pause]
259:09:39 Schirra: It looks like it may be warming up. [Pause]
259:09:47 Cunningham: Do you concur with the 4000 figure in the checklist, Houston?
259:09:52 Swigert: Affirmative. We're watching it here; we'll let you know.
259:09:55 Cunningham: Roger. Okay.
259:09:57 Schirra: We don't have a pump on the end, so we'll use what we've got. [Long pause]
259:10:31 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
259:10:35 Cunningham: Go ahead, Jack. [Pause]
259:10:40 Swigert: Stand by one. [Long pause]
259:11:02 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
259:11:04 Schirra: Go ahead.
259:11:05 Swigert: Donn, our telemetry here shows that the RCS DAP has not been initiated.
259:11:13 Eisele: Okay. We'll do it again.
259:11:14 Swigert: Okay. [Pause]
259:11:22 Schirra: Okay. We'll check your telemetry out.
259:11:25 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
259:11:29 Schirra: What does that look like?
259:11:31 Swigert: Stand by. [Long pause]
259:11:52 Swigert: Okay, 7. We show it now running.
259:11:56 Schirra: Very good. The call was worth it.
259:11:58 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
259:12:02 Schirra: We did initiate that before. I was quite surprised.
259:12:06 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
259:13:01 Swigert: Apollo 7, the DSE is yours; it's clean.
259:13:07 Cunningham: Roger. Thank you. Would you people initiate expulsion prior to deorbit burn? [Pause]
259:13:16 Swigert: Okay. Walt, you'll need to hit high bit rate and up telemetry to COMMAND RESET at that time. [Pause]
259:13:26 Cunningham: Okay. We'll do it then, and we'll do it 30 seconds prior to the burn.
259:13:30 Swigert: Roger. That's fine. [Long pause]
259:14:30 Swigert: Apollo 7, we're about 2 minutes LOS Carnarvon. You want to turn up S-band for Honeysuckle?
259:14:38 Schirra: Wilco.
Long comm break.
HONEYSUCKLE (REV 163)
259:20:10 Swigert: Apollo 7, we're about 2 minutes Tananarive; we pick up Hawaii at 33. I mean Honeysuckle.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; we are about to lose signal by the Honeysuckle Station in Australia for the last trip in this 163rd rev. We'll make Hawaii at 259 hours, 33 minutes, about 14 minutes from now. The weather out there in the recovery area this morning is quite good; the seas are described by news almost a dead calm. Wave heights on the order of 1 foot. They have had some showers in the area, but they are somewhat overcast, 15 hundred feet and broken. Gentle winds - the recovery point about 950 miles east of Cape Kennedy. We have just talked to the flight deck of the Essex; they are all set. We are sure the airplanes and the helicopters have been deployed and they are ready for their recovery role. In addition to the Essex, there is the destroyer The Storms, which is running with the Essex at 1500 yards to the East to rescue aircraft, Rescue 1, Rescue 2, operating out of Kinley Airforce Base in Bermuda. There is an AIRA aircraft, radar aircraft, capable of communicating and receiving signals from space; that aircraft is out of Patrick Air Force Base in Florida and the recovery helos, you'll hear reference to them, they are Recovery 1 and Recovery 2, both of which are backups, recovery choppers; recovery 3 will be the prime recovery chopper this morning. All 3 are Sikorsky helicopters; that will carry 5 - a crew of 2 or 3; and about 3 swimmers. In addition, the helicopters designated 1, a Sikorsky 3D helicopter, and finally and the most important helicopter, that one designated Air Boss. And it's entirely possible Air Boss will provide us with a running on scene copy, overview or commentary of the action. If that's a good signal, we will patch it right out to you, because obviously they have the best vantage point. At 259 hours, 22 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 259 hours, 33 minutes. In just any moment, we should acquire the spacecraft via Hawaii and then there will be a handover to the ship Huntsville as we start our course across the States. You have heard, in the last few days, a lot of discussion about the pressure on the eardrum. That pressure, the pressure will change in the cabin and it should go from 5 pounds starting its climb to sea level pressure of about 14.7. The change will occur at around 27,000 feet and by the time we are down to 10,000, we should very nearly be at 14 pounds. So if our communication with the spacecraft is good back from the recovery area, we may be able to get a report on how the ears fared while the crew is on main chute. The first call has gone out to the spacecraft but we have not heard their return call. We will stand by until we get that.

259:36:11 Schirra: [Garble] three. Verify RATE COMMAND.
259:36:14 Cunningham: Let's verify where the trim ended up.
259:36:17 Schirra: It looks good.
259:36:18 Cunningham: Okay. BMAG mode 3.
259:36:21 Schirra: Okay. Three of them, right? One rate two, one, two, and three.
259:36:26 Cunningham: Okay. We're standing by for 2 minutes.
259:36:30 Swigert: I'll give you a time hack at 2 minutes.
259:36:32 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
259:36:36 Swigert: Okay. A final...
259:36:37 Cunningham: Thanks for the long hours of support, Jack.
259:36:39 Swigert: Okay. It's been real fine, Walt. Just a final update on the weather in the recovery area: 2000 broken, winds 270 at 20, wave height at 3 feet. [Pause]
259:36:51 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause]
259:37:07 Swigert: Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
259:37:16 Swigert: MARK.
259:37:17 Swigert: T minus 2 minutes.
259:37:18 Cunningham: We're with you, Daddy.
259:37:19 Cunningham: FDAI scale five-five.
259:37:21 Schirra: Five five.
259:37:22 Cunningham: Delta-V thrust A and B NORMAL. [Pause]
259:37:29 Cunningham: Handcontrollers ARMED.
259:37:32 Schirra: ARMED.
259:37:34 Cunningham: Number 1 ARMED.
259:37:39 Cunningham: Okay. Standing by for up telemetry COMMAND RESET. I'll get that at 45 seconds. [Long pause]
259:38:16 Swigert: Sixty seconds. [Long pause]
Mark 1 minute from the deorbit burn, within 2 minutes after that deorbit burn, the spacecraft and the service module should separate. The spacecraft will be in a pitchdown 48 degree attitude at the time of the deorbit burn, about a 300 foot per second burn, some 10 seconds duration.
259:38:27 Schirra: Up telemetry is going to COMMAND RESET. [Long pause]
259:38:45 Cunningham: Thirty seconds. EMS Delta-V in AUTO.
259:38:49 Schirra: Delta-V in AUTO.
259:38:50 Cunningham: Flight qual recorder ON.
259:38:51 Schirra: Recorder's ON.
259:38:52 Schirra (onboard): [Garble] and counting. 14 hours and 15 seconds.
259:38:53 Eisele: PIPA'S are counting.
259:38:54 Cunningham: Four-jet ullage, 15 seconds.
259:38:55 Eisele (onboard): Roger.
259:38:56 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
259:39:01 Swigert: Fifteen seconds.
259:39:02 Schirra: Roger. And Delta-V's counting.
259:39:03 Schirra (onboard): How much?
259:39:04 Eisele (onboard): Ten. Delta-V is coming.
259:39:06 Swigert: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
259:39:06 Schirra: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, retrofire.
259:39:16 Swigert: RETROFIRE.
259:39:16 Schirra: RETROFIRE.
259:39:18 Schirra: And we're right on the mark. [Pause]
Schirra says we are burning right on the mark.
259:39:29 Schirra: Cutoff very good. [Pause]
And we show that indication here on the ground with 4 good ball values, cutoff and to emphasize the point, Wally added 'Very good.' Good retroburn.
259:39:34 Schirra: Gimbal's coming OFF.
259:39:37 Cunningham: There's your residual.
259:39:40 Schirra: Turn four channel ON. [Pause]
259:39:48 Swigert: Copy residual. [Pause]
We are reading 259 hours, 39 minutes, and already we are 35 seconds counting up from the retrofire point, 35 seconds from it. We will take -
259:39:54 Swigert: And, Walt, one last reminder: turn S-band volume up before seven.
259:39:59 Cunningham: Roger. [Pause]
259:40:07 Schirra: 19.8 on the Delta-V counter for the residual.
259:40:10 Swigert: Copy that.
259:40:12 Cunningham: We burned residuals to one-tenth.
259:40:15 Swigert: Roger.
259:40:16 Cunningham: Delta-V thrust A and B OFF.
259:40:19 Eisele: Spacecraft control to SCS.
259:40:21 Schirra: SCS.
259:40:22 Cunningham: Gimbal motors are OFF. Circuit breakers. Gimbal motor control, four OFF.
259:40:28 Schirra: Four OPEN.
259:40:28 Cunningham: TVC servo power, one and two OFF.
259:40:31 Schirra: One and two OFF.
259:40:34 Cunningham: Rotation handcontroller number 1 locked, Donn.
259:40:38 Eisele: Controller locked.
259:40:40 Eisele: EMS mode. Stand by; I've logged the residuals.
259:40:43 Schirra: Okay. 19.9.
That is Walt Cunningham you hear calling out those checklist items, and primarily Wally Schirra answering, Donn Eisele answering a few of them.
259:40:46 Cunningham (onboard): Okay, that's good, Wally.
259:40:47 Swigert: Okay. That's good. It was.
259:40:51 Schirra: Let's move out. [Pause]
259:40:59 Swigert: Call program 61. [Pause]
259:41:07 Cunningham (onboard): Now you've got the VERB 40, NOUN 20 to enter yet.
259:41:08 Schirra: You've got the rate. 49-20. [Pause]
259:41:16 Eisele (onboard): Wait 6 seconds and KEY RELEASE.
259:41:18 Cunningham: Primary glycol to radiator pulled, Wally.
259:41:22 Schirra: Mighty big handle. PLSS is pulled, babe.
259:41:26 Cunningham: Okay. PLSS valve ON.
That retroburn took place at an altitude of about 180 miles, 180 miles, and at a point on Earth of about 500 miles east of Hawaii.
259:41:27 Schirra (onboard): It's ON.
259:41:28 Eisele: PLSS ON. [Pause]
We are standing by for some word on separation. Still do not have confirmation on that event.
259:41:36 Cunningham: Oxygen service module supply valve OFF, and you could be yawing 45 degrees out of plane, Wally. [Long pause]
259:42:13 Schirra: Okay. Service mode supply valve OFF. [Long pause]
259:42:21 Cunningham (onboard): You got one more trip over there for the CAB VENT - CABIN PRESSURE RELIEF valve.
259:42:28 Cunningham (onboard): No, before, we want to go to BOOST ENTRY on those.
259:42:34 Cunningham (onboard): On both of them?
259:42:35 Cunningham (onboard): Yes. Right now.
259:42:38 Cunningham (onboard): Surge tank pressure is holding fine. I'm turning both VHF/AM's OFF. Antenna is on RECOVERY. S-band antenna is OMNI C.
259:43:02 Cunningham (onboard): Donn - Donn, service module RCS primary propellants A, B, C, D, ON, UP, talk-back's gray.
259:43:11 Swigert: Roger. LOS. Lost signal downlink.
Comm break.
259:43:13 Eisele (onboard): Roger, Walt, four gray ones.
259:43:16 Cunningham (onboard): Okay, we're standing by for Wally's call on the attitude.
259:43:23 Schirra (onboard): In ATTITUDE.
259:43:28 Eisele (onboard): Okay, CM/SM SEP, both ON. Now.
259:43:35 Schirra (onboard): That work?
259:43:51 Eisele (onboard): 25-1/2 volts. That's all we got.
259:43:57 Cunningham (onboard): Okay, caution and warning mode, command module, RCS transfer. Did it transfer?
259:44:05 Cunningham (onboard): You got your ENTRY ATTITUDE, Wally?
259:44:07 Cunningham (onboard): Okay, RCS transfer - we verify command module - command module RCS LOGIC, OFF.
259:44:16 Cunningham (onboard): Okay, we've got ENTRY ATTITUDE. Do you want single channel? If you do, let me know.
259:44:31 Cunningham (onboard): You want to go RATES HIGH after that burn. Okay, well, I missed a callout.
259:44:58 Eisele (onboard): Okay, the computer appears to be working fine, despite the low voltage.
259:45:01 Schirra (onboard): [Garble]?
259:45:04 Schirra (onboard): I'm just talking to - us.
259:45:13 Cunningham (onboard): Yes, we ought to make note that the main BUS A and B undervoltages are down to 25-1/2 volts on both main buses. We're coming in, low batteries.
259:45:24 Cunningham (onboard): Give me a call when you are ready for RING - single RING.
The spacecraft is still about a thousand miles west of the Baja California coast approximately over New Orleans; we'll be at 400,000 feet or 80 miles up, and at that point it will begin the warmer part of its journey. About 3 minutes after New Orleans, it will be over the Florida Coast and will be at an altitude of about 35 miles, and it will be quite warm. We will lose it during this 3 minutes, that will be our black out period.
259:45:34 Eisele: B and D; the roll, pitch, and yaw to channel A. [Long pause]
259:45:36 Cunningham (onboard): And do you want RING A or B?
259:45:41 Cunningham (onboard): Okay, then, close B and D ROLL 1, MAIN A, PITCH, MAIN A, and YAW, MAIN A. Reading you 5 squared, Jack. Everything came off hunky-dory.
259:45:53 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We're back with you.
259:45:56 Schirra: Reading you five-square, Jack. Everything came out hunky-dory.
259:45:59 Swigert: Okay. We lost you there for about 2 minutes.
259:46:03 Cunningham: Standing by for a postburn update.
259:46:05 Swigert: Okay. [Pause]
259:46:10 Cunningham: We had two main bus A and two main bus B undervoltage at SEP, and we got all three batteries ON. There is nothing more we can do; we are reading 25.2 volts.
259:46:19 Swigert: Copy that. [Long pause]
And that confirms separation of that last communication from Cunningham. We don't know the time on it, but it is confirmed the service module and the command module have separated.
259:47:04 Schirra: 259 54. [Long pause]
And as we go over the West Coast of the lower California Pennisula we are at about 120 miles altitude, and descending rapidly down what's come to be known as vacuum hill.
259:47:44 Cunningham (onboard): You have RANGE SET, RANGE TO GO, V0 SET, ENTRY, EMS mode AUTO?
259:47:52 Swigert: 7, we'll have the postburn PAD for you in about 2 minutes.
259:47:55 Cunningham (onboard): Roger.
259:47:58 Schirra: Everything's working beautifully, Jack.
259:48:00 Swigert: Right. You're looking good. You're coming right down the line.
259:48:03 Schirra: It's a slap in the face when we separate.
259:48:05 Swigert: Roger.
Long comm break.
259:48:06 Cunningham (onboard): DEADBAND MAX, RATES HIGH.
And we are 9 - 10 minutes from deorbit burn, we are at a hundred miles altitude; we are now over the Mexican mainland, and proceeding east. The line of flight will bring us across southern Texas, right over Houston, on east to New Orleans, and along the Florida coast. Flight director advises the deorbit maneuver was normal in all respects. This is Apollo Control standing by.
259:48:24 Cunningham (onboard): BMAG MODE, three, up to RATE 2 and ENTRY ATTITUDE.
259:48:33 Cunningham (onboard): The rest is on you, Wally.
The spacecraft has reported heads down; the pilots are heads down, and they have just started a roll attitude, a roll left maneuver, controlled by the computer, and they will roll up to about 55 degrees and hold that, for whatever a period of time the computer believes is necessary and then they will execute the opposite maneuver. It's called about a half lift reentry. Max G on the order of 5. This is Apollo Control, Houston. Standing by.
HAWAII through BERMUDA (REV 164)
259:52:00 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
259:52:02 Schirra: Ready to copy.
259:52:04 Swigert: Roger. Go with the preburn PAD. You were that close.
259:52:07 Schirra: Thank you.
259:52:08 Cunningham: How about that?
259:52:11 Swigert: You're looking real good, Wally. Coming right down the line.
259:52:13 Schirra: Roger, Ron. [Pause]
259:52:14 Schirra (onboard): She's riding up.
259:52:21 Schirra: We're on ring A, and she's a really nice control system.
259:52:25 Swigert: Roger. Copy that.
Comm break.
Apollo Control here. We have a very happy crew and the navigation of this maneuver is proving exactly as preplanned. We are at 60 miles altitude, and very close to Houston, almost right overhead, proceeding towards New Orleans. It's 14 minutes - we should be directly over New Orleans at the 400 000 foot mark, proceeding on east; blackout begins 3 minutes less than 3 minutes from now. And it will last just under 3 minutes. The 05G point should be acquired at about a minute and half from now.
259:54:41 Swigert: You're still looking good, 7.
The 05 G point should be upon us about a minute and a half from now, 60 miles altitude. I think earlier I had given an indication the blackout would occur between the New Orleans and Florida area, let's move that out between the Florida coast and about half way out, two thirds of the way out to Bermuda, about 700 miles. That will be the sector where we will not have communication. Hopefully we will then as we get on main chute.
259:54:43 Schirra: Roger. We're flying a pink cloud.
Earlier Wally Schirra reported separation was a real slap on the face, and you probably heard him just a second ago saying "We're flying a pink cloud." We are almost to our begin blackout point, about 40 seconds away from it. Flight Director has just adjusted the blackout time to 17 minutes and 30 seconds after the deorbit burn, now there is some question over the seconds. I think we will now stick to 17:02 after the deorbit, which would be right now, and now we do have confirmation they are in the blackout area. The spacecraft is right over the Florida Peninsula.
259:54:53 Schirra: Good.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. This is the quiet time here, even the Flight Director, all the voices are subdued. 18 minutes and 17 seconds since deorbit, and about a minute and a half from now we should be out - out of blackout.
259:58:07 Eisele (onboard): EMS, stand by for -
259:58:10 Eisele (onboard): MARK, 21,000.
This is Apollo Control here now. The crew should beginning - should start beginning to feel the G buildup, and it will peak out, it's a very comfortable 3G's but still that will be the peak load approximately the time that we leave the blackout zone. According to our clocks that's 10 or 15 seconds from now.
259:59:17 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
This is Apollo Control. Jack Swigert, the CapCom, has put out a call, no answer.
259:59:39 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Standing by. [Long pause]
259:59:40 Eisele (onboard): Lines in the center hatch window line up beautifully.
20 minutes 25 seconds since deorbit, and there goes the second call. Bermuda reported has acquisition of signal. Bermuda acquisition 259 hours, 59 minutes and 55 seconds, most all 59s. And we think we can detect the crackle of the Comm carrier in the ear phones, we have data from Bermuda, we've not voice yet, but we do have data, we have positive acquisition of the spacecraft. We are told the steering errors look real good from the telemetry. The flights dynamics officer and the retro fire officer are confident that we will be very close to target. Retro just said we're looking right at the target point.
260:00:25 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Standing by. [Long pause]
260:01:26 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
Long comm break.
22 minutes since deorbit. Flight reports - flight dynamics officers says that during the manuevers they observed 50 degrees roll in either direction left and right banks, and they estimate drogue chute coming out in about 2 minutes.
260:01:32 Eisele (onboard): Roger. Everything is fine.
According to the computer solution here he was - the spacecraft was within 3 miles of target when we lost lock - lost data lock - with the spacecraft only seconds ago from Bermuda. Still no voice contact with the spacecraft. This is not unusual. They probably configured for their recovery voice circuit which we can also monitor. Flight Director reminds us the drogue chutes should come out in about 1 minutes 50,000 foot point and down to 20 for the main chutes.
260:01:36 Schirra (onboard): Looking real good.
260:02:32 Schirra (onboard): Altimeter off the peg.
260:02:49 Cunningham (onboard): At 30 000, ELS LOGIC, ON; ELS, AUTO, at 30 000.
260:02:59 Cunningham (onboard): You'll have to give me some hacks on altitude.
260:03:02 Schirra (onboard): 35.
260:03:03 Eisele (onboard): 35.
260:03:11 Eisele (onboard): 30,000.
260:03:32 Eisele (onboard): Cabin pressure increasing.
Mark 24 minutes since deorbit. Still no voice and it is very quiet on the recovery circuit. You can see those choppers though by television. It's absolutely quiet here in the Control Center as everybody simply watches and waits to hear that transmission.
260:03:41 Eisele (onboard): 18,000?
260:03:46 Eisele (onboard): 18,000.
260:03:51 Eisele (onboard): 16.
260:04:03 Eisele (onboard): 13,000.
260:04:09 Eisele (onboard): Okay, standing by for mains, 12 000.
260:04:22 Eisele (onboard): We've got three of them.
260:04:32 Eisele (onboard): We've got three chutes out there, gang.
260:04:35 Cunningham (onboard): VHF to simplex A, beacon's going on, Donn could give his voice report.

260:04:41 Eisele (onboard): Roger, Apollo 7. DSKY shows our position is 27.60 degrees - 27.63 degrees latitude north, and 64.18 west longitude. Please get the carrier out of the way.
We should have main chute deploy. Main chutes due out at 25 minutes. Recovery reports via Kinley Rescue two in aircraft we have an electronic contact. An electronic contact from one of our C-130's operating out of Kinley Air Force Base. And now from the deck of the carrier we get the word from our recovery force that they are monitoring voice from the spacecraft, they're on chutes and all is well.
260:05:02 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
260:05:13 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
260:05:14 Eisele (onboard): Okay. We're at 7500, gang.
260:05:17 Schirra (onboard): We have three good chutes and we're descending very nicely. Our attitude very stable on the main chutes. We have a slight pyro odor in the cockpit; that may be fuel. We'll cheek that against something else later. We're going through the clag now.
260:05:29 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
260:05:37 Cunningham (onboard): Roger, we closed the command module RCS propellant at about 12 - 14 000 because of the odor in the cockpit.
260:05:50 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
260:05:53 Cunningham (onboard): Wally, if you have a chance, we could go to DUMP on the CABIN PRESSURE RELEASE valve, and all we'll have to do is close them later.
260:06:06 Cunningham (onboard): Let's go to DUMP.
260:06:10 Cunningham (onboard): We'll have to close them below a thousand.
260:06:15 Cunningham (onboard): Okay, I'll get my hand on it.
260:06:16 Schirra (onboard): Broadcast everything we're saying.
260:06:18 Cunningham (onboard): Roger. We go to DUMP on the command module CABIN PRESSURE RELEASE valves. We'll open them - go to CLOSE on them below 1000.
260:06:23 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
260:06:27 Schirra (onboard): My windows are steamed up.
260:06:29 Cunningham (onboard): So are mine.
260:06:31 Eisele (onboard): I think that's probably from the moisture. That, might dry off.
260:06:34 Schirra (onboard): Yes, we went through some clouds, that's for sure,
From the Essex, we get a report that the spacecraft is reporting their windows are slightly steamed up, apparently not yet on the water.
260:06:36 Cunningham (onboard): An RC - R - IFR approach, isn't it?
260:06:39 Eisele (onboard): It sure is. We're cleared straight in, though.
260:06:44 Schirra (onboard): Right down the slot. This is Apollo 7, descending through 4200 feet on an IFR approach, expect straight-in clearance, no delay, got the wheels DOWN and LOCKED!
260:06:45 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
And now from the Essex, they advise the crew's report being "The wheels are down and locked". Would be a navy - typical Schirra navy approach to landing "the wheels are down and locked" they apparently are preparing to hit that water, Apollo 7 now is in contact with Air Boss, the recovery helicopter over the scene.
ARIA 4 (REV 164)
260:06:51 Swigert: ARIA 4. Go REMOTE. [Pause]
260:06:59 Communications Technician: ARIA 4. Going REMOTE. [Pause]
260:07:08 Cunningham (onboard): Hey, Wally, this ELS - after landing, I'll hit the pyro circuit breakers here and you can get the LOGIC ON and the ELS OFF.
260:07:09 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
260:07:15 Swigert: Apollo 7, read you loud and clear. How me?
260:07:17 Schirra (onboard): Roger. Watch out, we're coming down IFR. We have a straight-in, expect no delay on clearance.
260:07:22 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA. [Long pause]
260:07:26 Schirra (onboard): Houston, loud and clear.
260:07:37 Schirra (onboard): Passing through 3800 feet now. Three very good chutes, very stable spacecraft. We are prepared for landing.
260:07:39 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
260:07:59 Schirra (onboard): I feel sorry for all you one-shoe people out there. I don't like it even now.
260:08:01 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
260:08:06 Schirra (onboard): 2000 feet.
260:08:21 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
Comm break.
The carrier says they haven't had a report for a minute or so now but apparently they got very steady reports 2,000 feet altitude, 2,000 feet.
260:08:25 Eisele (onboard): Read you loud and clear, Houston. Stand by.
And now from the Essex we're told the crew has been reading our calls from here loud and clear. We have not heard from them, however, the Essex has. And Apollo 7 now reporting an altitude of 600 feet, six zero zero feet. Altitude 300 feet, this the crew reporting to us back via the Essex. The carrier was just queried to see if they have any visual sightings yet and they reported they had not which is confirmed by our television view. And we should be on the water or very very close to SPLASH. We still have received no direct voice contact from here. As we said before, the Essex has been in touch and we would assume they are in the water.
260:10:09 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
Long comm break.
And this is Apollo Control, Houston, we have not established an electronic contact by our recovery helicopters as yet, the Sarah beacon is a little search beacon that the spacecraft puts out. They had glod voice com between the various recovery units right up to SPLASH and since then we just don't know but the ceiling and the cloud conditions could have some effect on their operation out there today. Certainly the visual sighting.
260:16:05 Communications Technician: [Garble] up to about 40 dB when we have it, but we have been unable to AUTO track it.
Comm break.
260:19:07 Communications Technician: Okay. COMM TECH, ARIA 4.
Comm break.
There is some question as to whether the spacecraft had turned on its rescue beacon, its recovery beacon. The last voice contact was at 300 feet. We got no visual sightings, several electronic sightings coming in. We're just standing by and waiting like everyone else. We have a report from the Essex that Recovery Two and Recovery Three, the helicopters, are reporting intermittent signals, they are trying to plot a bearing right now, they think they have something in sight, they think they're reading something on their scopes. Stand by. Ah, Rescue Two is proceeding on a bearing which they think is the spacecraft. As yet we have no range estimate. Now from the Essex, we get the report that Recovery Three has lost contact momentarily with their target. Our target point indicator shows 64 degrees by 27, very nearly 27, as the likely SPLASH area. And now, Recovery helicopter three has a new contact and they are proceeding to run it down. And now Air Boss and Recovery Three are tracking bearings, proceeding on the target. We as yet have had no estimate on the range and apparently no voice contact on the water.
260:20:34 Swigert: We still have...
Comm break.
Now Recovery Two is proceeding on a bearing of two one zero and our voice circuit out to the Essex is getting a little noisy in the last few minutes, which is making it difficult to hear.
260:22:06 Swigert: Roger. Out.
Long comm break.
From the deck of the Essex they advise very cautiously that they are looking now at a very tentative splash point. This tentative bearing turns out to be a point about 18 miles from the Essex, about 18 miles, and the Essex emphasizes that this is a tentative bearing. The voice - our voice line to the Essex is now restored. We can - it is an intelligible transmission. We lost it there for a few minutes. This is Apollo Control in Houston, when we get more information we will be right back to you.
RECOVERY 3 (REV 164)
260:30:01 Recovery-3: This is Recovery 3. We are on top of the command module at this time on these online coordinates 11537.
260:30:12 Schirra: Recovery 3, this is Apollo 7.
260:30:13 Recovery-3: Roger, Apollo 7.
And this is Apollo Control, Houston. Now Recovery 1 has established electronic communication with Apollo 7.
260:30:15 Recovery-3: [Garble] coordinates [garble] 33. We have a little communications with Apollo 7 at this time. Conditions appear normal. The command module is moving into a stable I position. We have maneuvered to commence frogman deployment.
Now we have a report from the Essex that the spacecraft was in what's called stable 1 in NASA talk. That means they were heads down. They were submerged there with their bottom side up towards the air, which probably precluded a lot of transmission, however, they have - apparently inflated their right bags, or their floatation bags. They are now apex up floating and they are establishing electronic contact. Recover 1 has positive contact and now we got the picture. Everybody gets faked out by "recorded picture". Again now the Essex reports that the spacecraft is floating upright and at last reports the spacecraft is about 18 miles north of the aiming track.
260:30:39 Schirra: Recovery 3, as soon as you attach the flotation ring, we will deploy the grappling hook. [Pause]
260:30:53 Schirra: Apollo 7 here, Recovery 3.
260:31:00 Recovery-3: Apollo 7, this is Recovery 3. Go ahead.
260:31:03 Schirra: Roger. Please inform us if deployment is required of the grappling hook. [Long pause]
Now from the Essex we get a report that recovery Hilo 1 has been in communication with the spacecraft all is well. Our voice circuit out there is getting a little erratic again. Now we are getting a report 17 miles from the Essex. That's 17 miles and apparently north of the aiming point from the Essex. Now Recovery 2 has a Sarah beacon and this would account for the fact that we got no electronic contact during those early minutes on the water. The spacecraft had submerged. This was something that had been anticipated. It was practiced with the crew practiced in a number of engineering tests in the development of the spacecraft. The fact that the spacecraft could submerge apex down, in which case we would have to right it in order to get electronic contact. We may hear a little later here as we move through this recovery operation from somebody who will be called simply Airboss, that's Commander William C. Haskell, of Norwich, New York. He will be in command of the Airboss helicopter.
260:31:21 Recovery-3: Apollo 7, this is Recovery 3. We are in the process of making our [garble]; we will have backoff without voice communications. Over.
260:31:33 Schirra: We understand that; and if you want the grappling hook, give us a little lead time; we'll be standing by. Over. [Long pause]
260:32:24 Recovery-3: Essex, this is Recovery 3. All prelifting [garble] have been complied with, flotation collar affixed, and I am presently approaching the command module.
260:32:33 Essex: Roger.
And Apollo Control here and Recovery 3 - Recovery 2 correct that, has a visual sighting now on the spacecraft about 17 miles north of the Essex. Recovery 2.
260:32:35 Recovery-3: Essex, this is Recovery 3 by [garble] 1186.5.
260:32:41 Essex: Roger. [Pause]
Now Recovery 3 is reporting they are on top of the Command Module. The chopper under the command of Commander Edward A. Scobee, Edward A. Scobee, of Pueblo, Colorado, is reporting that he is right on top of the Command Module.
260:32:49 Recovery-3: Apollo 7, this is Recovery 3. Over.
260:32:52 Schirra: Go ahead, Recovery 3.
260:32:57 Schirra: Apollo 7, go ahead.
260:32:59 Schirra: Go ahead, Recovery 3. [Garble].
260:33:10 Recovery-3: This is Recovery 3. As soon as our frogmen complete installing the flotation gear, everything is functioning normal. The command module appears [garble] bluish on one side and a yellowish color.
This is Apollo Control, Houston now we are in touch. We are hearing the spacecraft. We hear Wally Schirra talking with the Recovery Helo. Just to give you an idea of how noisy this voice circuit is let's bring it up so we can all hear it. We may have deafened a lot of people, but that's what we're listening to this morning.
Air Boss
260:33:30 Air Boss: This is Air Boss on station on recovery of the command module [garble].
Now our Recovery - one of our Recovery Helos is all set to deploy swimmers. Swimmers, swimmers are in the water and we'll assume that they are from Recovery Helo 3, which is the prime Recovery Helo.
260:33:41 Air Boss: This is Air Boss. The command module is in stable I position, floating very nicely. The three uprighting bags are fully inflated. One swimmer is installing the flotation collar. One swimmer is now attaching the sea anchor; the other two swimmers are now attaching the flotation collar; the beacon has already been attached. The collar is now approximately one-third attached. There has been very slight scorching on approximately one-third of the area of the command module. The rest is [garble].
Now this is Apollo Control, Houston. The swimmers are installing the flotation collar at this time. Now the flotation collar is fully inflated and around the spacecraft.
Air Boss
260:34:20 Air Boss: Apollo 7, Air Boss. Over.
260:34:22 Schirra: Go ahead, Boss.
260:34:23 Air Boss: Roger.
260:34:26 Schirra: Very good. Our Air Force type had a little bit of nausea, but is none the worse off.
260:34:33 Air Boss: Roger.
260:34:36 Air Boss: Essex, Essex, this is Air Boss. Over.
260:34:37 Essex: Roger. This is Essex.
260:34:38 Air Boss: Roger. The astronauts report they are all very, very good. Over.
260:34:45 Essex: Roger.
260:34:46 Air Boss: Command module has no apparent damage to it at this point. The collar is now about to be attached; the two ends are now being joined by the swimmers in the water.
260:35:06 Essex: Roger.
And Apollo Control, Houston here. We've just gotten a report from Airboss. That report was, "there is no visible damage, no visible damage from the trip in space to the Command Module", it is riding nicely now on its flotation collar. Now we have a report [garble].
260:35:10 Air Boss: There is no apparent sea dye in the water at this time that we can see. The inflation's about to begin. [Pause]
260:35:25 Air Boss: The rotating beacon does not appear to be working at this time; however, the antennas - the two VHF antennas are erected. The swimmers are making the final check on the collar prior to inflation. The third swimmer is below the command module proceeding to take pictures. The rotating beacon is now operating. The two VHF antennas are extended. The three flotation bags are inflated, and photo I is now entering the area. [Pause]
Now we have a report that one of the crew members may be a little nauseated, a little nauseated. We could not make out which crew member that was.
260:36:01 PHOTO I: Air Boss, request clearance for PHOTO 1.
260:36:05 Air Boss: Photo I - [Pause]
260:36:14 Air Boss: Air Boss to Apollo 7 commander. Do you see the lights, now? I didn't have the switch on.
260:36:18 Schirra: Standby. 7.
260:36:21 Air Boss: Roger. Checklist for verification.
260:36:24 Schirra: Roger. Stand by.
260:36:25 Air Boss: This is Air Boss. We have the beacon, and it is now operating properly.
260:36:27 Schirra: Well, good! Just takes a little bit of switchmanship, I guess.
260:36:30 Air Boss: Stand by.
260:36:33 Air Boss: The procedures now - our cell has not been inflated [garble] arears to be no trouble at this time. The swimmers are just making final cheek. It's inflating and secure. [Pause]
260:36:48 Air Boss: The collar is now starting its inflation. It is one-third inflated at this time. All appears to be normal. [Pause]
260:37:04 Air Boss: This is Air Boss standing by about 5 miles away. Five miles. The command module bears 130 magnetic, 5 miles from your position at this time. [Pause]
260:37:17 Essex: Essex. Roger. The flotation collar is now fully inflated. The swimmers are checking around the command module to assure that all the attachments are complete. [Pause]
Apollo Control, Houston here, The Essex reports they are reading the helicopter and the spacecraft quite clearly now. There is some joshing going on now about Schirra getting his first submarine service, a reference to the inverted spacecraft. I don't think in his long naval career he has had any submarine service, but 16 miles I think we copied. 16 miles and the collar is fully inflated.
This is Apollo Control now. Now the Essex is giving us new position, they are 5 miles from the spacecraft, 5 miles and proceeding directly on it. Now we have a report from the Essex. They report the flight crews have tagged up, their physical status is good, they say they are all in good shape.
This is Apollo Control, Houston here. We are, at last report, 4 miles from the spacecraft. The crew will go aboard the Essex via helicopters. They will be picked up by probably Rescue 3, whose swimmers are now in the water.
This is Apollo Control, Houston. Our circuit out to the Essex is quite garbled at this point, but we believe he said they are dropping a ladder, one of the recovery helos dropping a ladder to the crew. We'll see if we can't get confirmation on that here.
Apollo Control, Houston, here. They are reporting from the Essex a light rain shower in the area, and they also got a question the Essex wants to know if we're seeing the television picture back here in Mission Control, and of course we are. We've advised that we'd like to see a spacecraft on that television screen, just like everybody else. They are estimating now 5,000 yards, 5,000 yards on a cloudy day.
260:37:42 Schirra: Air Boss, Apollo 7. We're in good shape. We're going to go off COMM for about 4 or 5 minutes.
260:37:48 Air Boss: Roger. We'll just be orbiting up here in place.
260:37:51 Unidentifiable crewmember: Okay. [Pause]
260:37:57 Air Boss: Essex, this is Air Boss. Apollo 7 is going off COMM now for about 5 minutes [garble].
260:37:59 Essex: Essex. Roger. [Long pause]
Apollo 7 has just advised the Essex they are going off the air. They are turning off their radios and securing, and we've been advised the crew is getting ready to open the hatch of their spacecraft. The next step would of course be to enter the helicopter, and the astronauts have already expressed congratulations to the recovery forces before they turned off their on-the-water radio.
260:38:24 Recovery-3: Essex, this is Recovery 3. We did not recover the three main chutes nor do we have them in sight at this time. Over.
260:38:33 Essex: Essex. Roger. [Pause]
260:38:43 Air Boss: This is Air Boss. I now have Essex in sight; it is about 4 miles away bearing 125. The .3 [garble]. The swimmer is now attaching the retriever in position [garble]. [Long pause]
260:39:16 Essex: Air Boss, this is Essex. Over. We Roger.
260:39:23 Air Boss: Essex, this is Air Boss. [Garble] main chute down [garble] about 20 yards [garble].
This is Apollo Control, Houston, the hatch is open, and the pilots are moving in to a helicopter. The first astronaut is now getting into a helicopter.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, and now we are advised the swimmers are arrayed around outside the spacecraft on the collar, but they are just waiting for apparently additional astronauts to emerge. They are also looking in the area for the Apex cover from the spacecraft.
The crew reported a little slow getting out of the command module.
Now we are getting a report down range that one of the pilots is stepping into the life raft, but we don't know which one yet.
Now we're getting the report the second astronaut is getting out of the spacecraft. This is frequently a problem out there because the recovery - the recovery crews don't know the the pilots by a visual sighting, so they can only report first astronaut, second astronaut. An astronaut is on his way up into the helicopter, is being hoisted by a net.
Now we have a pilot about to enter the door to the helicopter and the last, a third and last astronaut, probably Wally Schirra, is leaving the command module now. And now we have a report that a second astronaut is in the helicopter, second astronaut is in the helicopter.
Now Wally Schirra is reported out of the command module. It's not clear to us whether he's in the raft or on the ladder. The second astronaut is reported fully aboard the recovery helicopter. That would leave only Wally, who at last report was on the raft and waving vigorously.
Now we are getting a report that all three astronauts are aboard the helicopter and if that is the case, they should be proceeding directly to the Essex.
This Apollo Control, Houston. We have a report from the scene that the hatch is now being closed by the swimmers. The spacecraft has been secured, all three pilots are in the helicopter. From the AIRBOSS hovering over the scene just advised that the helicopter is about 3 miles from the carrier and is proceeding now towards the Essex, recovery 3, with the three astronauts proceeding now toward the Essex at 2-1/2 miles out.
This is Apollo Control, Houston. We now have a report from the helicopter that it should be on deck in about 3 minutes, estimating 3 minutes to the deck of the carrier. They are deviating to avoid some shower activity out in the area. Looks like we have got it in sight now. We clocked the pickup at something on the order of 50 minutes after splash - the pilots were in the helicopter.
26x:xx:xx PRESIDENT: Captain Walter Schirra, Commander Donn Eisele, and Major Walter Cunningham, this is the President. We here in the Capitol, and all over this country and world are so very proud of you this morning. The skies there have been opened upon you showing the hopes of the world lifted to you, and in this universal gladness there is the making of a human partnership. Where space technology and science will serve as instruments of man's peace in the world. And that's really enough for the United States, to excel in space. And today despite our trials we have only our fingertips on the latch to unlock a world of miracles both practical and profound. So the blessings we already hold in our hands, we know that neither complacency nor conceit can stay our hands from reaching higher. So, your fellow countrymen are happy to welcome all of you home with that encouragement. We salute the three of you, as well as the thousands of your space team led by Mr. Webb and others, have great admiration and affection and when you have finished your debriefings, Mrs. Johnson and I hope to receive you where we can talk about your experiences without having to go through a Houston switchboard. Thank you very much.
26x:xx:xx Schirra: Thank you very much, Mr. President and over to Donn Eisele.
26x:xx:xx Eisele: Thank you very much, Mr. President.
26x:xx:xx Cunningham: Thank you very much, Mr. President it was our pleasure and honor to make the trip.
