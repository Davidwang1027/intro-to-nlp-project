048:06:24 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7.
048:06:26 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
048:06:29 Eisele: Roger. I just did that daylight aligment, and we're told to pick a pair, and I picked out Rasalhague and Nunke. Rasalhague came in clear enough to mark on, but Nunki was a total loss because it's too close to the Earth's limb. [Long pause]
048:06:47 Swigert: Okay. Understand you got a daylight alignment. [Pause]
048:06:51 Eisele: Roger. Well, I didn't complete it. I got as far as having to pick a pair of big looking stars, but you will never be able to find them yourself. But I saw this Ras-Alhague when I picked out something in the sextant and marked it. I assume it was Rasalhague because that's what we were going for. But the point is, daylight alignments aren't going to work too well unless you got far enough away from limb of Earth and other bodies. [Long pause]
048:07:20 Swigert: Okay. Copy that, Donn.
048:07:23 Eisele: And I think that doing a P51 under these conditions would be a dead loss. [Pause]
048:07:32 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
Long comm break.
048:12:24 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houstom. One minute LOS Canary. Tananarive in about 12 minutes. [Pause]
048:12:31 Unknown crewmember: Roger.
Very long comm break.
TANANARIVE (REV 31)
048:25:58 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. [Pause]
048:26:02 Unknown crewmember: Roger.
Long comm break.
048:29:21 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7.
048:29:24 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
048:29:26 Eisele: Roger. We've got a lockup in the comp cycle of program 21. Could you get a G&N bearing on us, or give us a handy dandy on what to do to correct that to get out of it? [Long pause]
048:29:43 Swigert: Okay. I understand that you are locked up into program 21?
048:29:46 Eisele (onboard): Roger, it's in the COMP cycle.
048:29:50 Swigert: Is that correct?
048:29:51 Eisele: In that time interim, we hit the PROSEED button, and the COMP light has been on ever since. [Long pause]
048:30:07 Swigert: Okay. Stand by, 7. We're getting somebody to help us out here. [Pause]
048:30:12 Eisele: Roger. [Long pause]
048:31:00 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
048:31:04 Eisele: Go.
048:31:06 Swigert: Donn, can you tell us at what display you had in the program when you hit the PROCEED? [Pause]
048:31:12 Eisele (onboard): Roger, I had the time in, the NOUN 34 display.
048:31:15 Eisele: We had the time [garble] went into normal ground track, and it usually only takes about a minute to calculate the position. [Pause]
048:31:25 Eisele (onboard): And it's been there ever since for several minutes now.
048:31:28 Swigert: Could you say again? We missed the display.
048:31:31 Eisele (onboard): Roger. NOUN 34. I loaded the data, hit PROCEED, and it's been in COMP ever since.
048:31:50 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. I understand you had the time in there, and it was going to integrate ahead to figure out where you were, and that is the procedure you are talking about? [Pause]
048:32:00 Eisele: That's right.
048:32:01 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
048:32:14 Swigert: What time did you put in there, Apollo 7?
Comm break.
048:32:18 Eisele (onboard): I put in 48:26 - 25 or 26. I don't remember now.
048:32:48 Eisele (onboard): Houston. We've got a downlink path light also on our program alarm.
048:34:05 Swigert: Apollo 7, we're going to have continuous coverage here through ARIA 1 until we reach Carnarvon.
Long comm break.
Apollo Control Houston here. The comm via Tananarive was a little rocky, but we did make out Donn Eisele reported he had entered a program into the computer and got a CAUTION alarm. Something wasn't going just right with the computer. No big crisis. We will look at it and talk about it some more over Carnarvon I am sure, at which point we will be in - due to acquire there at 48 hours 41 minutes into the flight, 7 minutes from now. At 48 hours 34 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control Houston.
ARIA 3. (REV 31) [Pause]
048:34:11 Eisele (onboard): Roger, understand. Ask him if I can do VERB 99? See if that will fix it.
048:37:12 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 1. [Long pause]
048:37:44 Swigert: Apollo 7, Nouston through ARIA 1. [Long pause]
048:38:05 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 1.
Comm break.
048:39:13 Eisele (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7.
048:39:16 Unidentifiable crewmember: This is Apollo 7. [Pause]
048:39:20 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
048:39:30 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We're reading you five-by.
Comm break.
Apollo Control Houston, 48 hours, 42 minutes into the flight. We have just tagged up with the crew through Carnarvon and here is what it sounds like.
CARNARVON (REV 31)
048:42:05 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
048:42:07 Eisele: Roger. Hear you, CAP COM Houston.
048:42:10 Swigert: Roger. Real fine. Did you come out okay on P21, Donn? [Pause]
048:42:15 Eisele: Yes, it finally quit integrating. I'd already asked it to go to P00, so it went straight to P00. [Pause]
048:42:21 Swigert: Okay. Real fine. I've got some discussion on the primary evaporator to take up with Walt here. [Pause]
048:42:31 Cunningham: He's listening. He's writing.
048:42:34 Swigert: Okay. There will be some procedures, so you might want to copy this down. What we would llke to do is to determine the status of the primary water boiler, and then we - therefore, we intend to activate the primary evaporator over the stateside pass this revolution. So when bringing the evaporator on, Walt, we want you to open the back pressure valve manually for 2 seconds, since we're not sure how much water is in the evaporator, and this would minimize any possibility of carrying excess water through the steam duct and possibly freezing it. Then on the ground cue over the States, we would like you to first put the glycol evaporator H2O flow switch to AUTO. Second, put the glycol evaporator steam pressure to MANUAL. Third, go DECREASE for 2 seconds. Observe the temperature decay on the primary evaporator outlet. If you don't get any decay, we want to go DECREASE for 2 seconds more. If you get a temperature decrease, then wait 30 seconds; place the evaporator steam pressure to AUTO. We'll watch it all from the ground, but if you observe any anomalies in your out-of-ground conta, we would like you to troubleshoot per the malfunction procedures recorded on high bit rate on DSE and report it to the next site. And if you want any of this repeated, I'll go over it with you - a little slower.
048:44:20 Cunningham: I could write about half that fast, and I only got the first three steps, Jack. Back pressure open for 2 seconds; do you want me to do that prior to getttng into the States? [Pause]
048:44:29 Swigert: No, we will do this when we hit the States, so we can watch it here. We will tell you when we've got good data; and then when you bring it on, open it for 2 seconds. This will all be on ground cue. And then - I'll read these steps again, a little slower, Walt. First step, H2O flow to AUTO; second, steam pressure to MANUAL; third, decrease steam pressure switch to DECREASE for an additional 2 seconds. Observe for a temperature decay on the EVAP OUT temperature. Okay. If you don't get any temperature decay, decrease the steam pressure for 2 additional seconds. Then, if you get a temperature decrease on the EVAP OUT temperature, wait 30 seconds; then place the glycol EVAP OUT steam pressure to AUTO. Okay. If you get any anomalies and you're out of ground contact, troubleshoot it per the malfunction procedures, recording it on high bit rate, and we'll pick you up at the next site.
Comm break.
048:46:24 Cunningham: Roger. Jack, I got step 4. Decrease steam pressure for 2 seconds, watch the glycol EVAP OUT temperature decrease, and disconnect set. [Pause]
048:46:32 Swigert: Okay. After temp decrease is observed, wait 30 seconds; then place the steam pressure switch to AUTO. [Long pause]
048:46:55 Cunningham: I have here decrease something for 2 additional seconds. [Pause]
048:47:02 Swigert: Okay. Let me go over it again. [Pause]
048:47:10 Cunningham: Two seconds.
048:47:12 Swigert: Okay. You go to MANUAL, decrease the steam pressure for 2 seconds; that's step 3. If you don't get any temperature decay, decrease - third, decrease steam pressure switch to DECREASE for an additional 2 seconds. That's step 4. [Long pause]
048:47:35 Cunningham: Roger. I understand that if I don't get any pressure decrease - temperature decrease in how long a time period? [Long pause]
048:47:48 Swigert: About 30 seconds - give it 30 seconds, Walt, to note any temperature change. [Pause]
048:47:57 Cunningham: Roger. The back pressure open for 2 seconds on your cue; water flow to AUTO on cue. Steam pressure to MANUAL, decrease steam pressure for 2 seconds. Watch the glycol EVAP OUT temp decrease; if no temp decrease in 30 seconds, then I - decrease steam pressure for another 2 seconds. If I get a decrease, I wait 30 seconds and then go to AUTO. Any anomalies, I troubleshoot. [Long pause]
048:48:23 Swigert: That's good; you got it. Okay, Apollo 7. You might want to turn your S-band volume up; we're about to pick up Honeysuckle here. [Long pause]
048:48:38 Cunningham: Roger, Jack.
048:48:39 Swigert: We'll just be standing by here. We don't have anything special for you. [Pause]
048:48:43 Eisele: Okay. You might find out what rate they want set up for this G&N attitude control test. [Pause]
048:48:51 Swigert: I didn't copy that, Donn. You were a little garbled. [Pause]
048:48:56 Swigert: I said, the G&N test: what rate do you want put in?
048:48:59 Swigert: Okay. Stand by.
Comm break.
HONEYSUCKLE (REV 31)
048:50:51 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
048:51:03 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
048:51:19 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
048:51:32 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
048:51:54 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Honeysuckle.
048:51:57 Schirra (onboard): Got you, Jack.
048:51:59 Cunningham: Roger, Jack.
048:52:00 Swigert: Okay. You're five-by. On Donn's question, it was that weight W-E-I-G-H-T or rate R-A-T-E? [Pause]
048:52:09 Eisele: R-A-T-E, Jack.
048:52:11 Swigert: Okay. Okay. Stand by.
Comm break.
048:55:02 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
048:55:09 Eisele: Roger. Go, Houston.
048:55:10 Swigert: Okay. Donn, what we would like to have is a spacecraft maneuver rate, at somewheres - rate 1 degree per second or greater. In the DAP, we would like you to set 4 degrees per second in the rate.
Very long comm break.
048:59:55 Eisele (onboard): Eisele had 10 flicks of water at 48:59.
This is Apollo Control Houston, 49 hours 9 minutes into the flight. Hawaii is due to acquire momentarily and let's listen.
HAWAII through ANTIGUA (REV 31)
049:09:21 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
049:09:35 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
049:09:38 Eisele (onboard): Roger, Jack. Hey listen, on this G&N test, we don't want to build up a rate, then take it out. That wastes too much fuel, and we are a little shy anyway. What I was asking you is what rate setting you want on the DAP load, but I'll just use 0.2, and I suggest we just put it in wide DEADBAND, ATTITUDE HOLD, and let it sit there awhile.
049:09:59 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
049:10:19 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston with an update. [Pause]
049:10:27 Eisele (onboard): Roger, Jack. What is the update?
049:10:32 Eisele (onboard): Go with your update.
049:10:44 Swigert: Apollo 7, do you read? Houston.
049:10:47 Eisele: Roger.
049:10:49 Swigert: Okay. Donn, we have an update on DAP rate deadband we'd like you to set in; we would like you to set in two-tenths of a degree per second for the rate deadband for this G&N attitude control test. [Long pause]
049:11:05 Eisele: Okay. I got that in.
049:11:08 Swigert: Okay. Real fine. [Pause]
049:11:15 Eisele: Jack?
049:11:16 Swigert: Go ahead.
049:11:17 Eisele: I'm not going to do that 1 degree per second because it wastes too much feel. What I will do is just go ahead and put it in G&N attitude hold at deadband for two-tenths rate and then let it sit around here for as long as you want to look at it. [Long pause]
049:11:32 Swigert: Okay. You want to - we copy that. We'll give you - we haven't picked up high bit rate here; we'll give you a hack as soon as we have high bit rate. [Long pause]
049:11:44 Eisele: Okay. I'm ready to copy your log data. [Pause]
049:11:48 Swigert: Roger. I'll give you that. Opposite omni first. [Long pause]
049:12:04 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We have high bit rate; you can start the G&N attitude control test; and, Walt, I will give you the block data. [Pause]
049:12:13 Cunningham: Roger. This is [garble] now. [Pause]
049:12:23 Swigert: Okay. Block data for block number 6 as follows: 033 dash 4C plus 314 minus 1450 52 plus 05 plus 09 4335, 34 dash 3C plus 200 plus 1500 53 plus 21 plus 42 4119, 035 dash 3B plus 250 plus 1390 054 plus 55 plus 07 4143, 036 dash 4A plus 250 minus 1659 056 plus 46 plus 40 4785, 037 dash 3A plus 315 plus 1390 058 plus 07 plus 17 4439, 30-38 dash 3A plus 283 plus 1374 059 plus 42 plus 35 4645.
Comm break.
049:14:32 Eisele: Roger. Readback follows: 033 dash 4 Charlie plus 314 minus 1450 052 05 09 4335, 34 dash 3 Bravo plus 200 plus 1500 053 plus 21 plus 42 4119, 035 [garble] plus 315 plus 1390 058 plus 07 plus 17 4439, 38 dash 3 Able plus 283 plus 1374 059 plus 42 plus 35 and 4645. Over. [Pause]
049:14:40 Swigert: Roger. Walt, we had a transition from Hawaii to Huntsville, and I lost a little bit of it here. The second block was 034 dash 3 Charlie instead of 3 Bravo. And I lost you right after 035 dash 3 Bravo. Could you give me that down to the beginning of 037 dash 3 Able?
Comm break.
049:16:13 Cunningham: Roger. I'll-pick up. 035 dash 3 Bravo - I O got your correction - 034 dash 3 Charlie and 035 dash 3 Bravo plus 250 plus 1390 054 plus 59 plus 07 4143, 036 dash 4 Able plus 250 minus 1659 056 plus 46 plus 40 4785. Over. [Long pause]
049:16:41 Swigert: Roger. That's got it. We copied five-by.
Long comm break.
049:21:14 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
049:21:17 Cunningham: Go ahead, Houston, Apollo 7.
049:21:19 Swigert: Roger. On this primary evaporator activation: we are going to wait until we get a RAD OUT temperature above 50 before we start it. [Long pause]
049:21:31 Cunningham: Roger. Do you have any idea about what time you want to do that? It doesn't get above 50 until after we have been in a daylight pass most of the pass. [Long pause]
049:21:44 Swigert: Roger. We are just discussing that now. It looks like the way it's coming up, it's going to be a little bit. [Pause]
049:21:52 Cunningham: Roger. It hasn't been coming up. You are talking about the evaporator outlet temperature, I assume; it hasn't been coming above 50, until [garble] to the last part of the daylight pass. [Pause]
049:22:01 Swigert: No, we were talking about the RAD OUT temperature, Walt, just so we can make sure that the boiler is going to really work. [Long pause]
049:22:12 Cunningham: Okay. I'm showing a RAD OUT temperature now of just about 50. [Pause]
049:22:18 Swigert: Okay. Stand by here. [Long pause]
049:22:29 Swigert: We are only showing a RAD OUT of 42 degrees, and we are going to check CAL curve right now. [Pause]
049:22:36 Cunningham: Roger. I am reading 49, about on border; [garble] 3 paint scale. Let's say 45 to 50. [Pause]
049:22:46 Swigert: Okay.
Comm break.
049:25:04 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
049:25:08 Eisele: Go, Houston.
049:25:10 Swigert: Okay. Donn, on that RAD OUT, when - we are reading 43 now, and there is a big spread between your value and ours, and ours is correct according to the CAL curve, so it will be a little bit yet before we get to activation of the evaporator. [Long pause]
HAWAII through ANTIGUA (REV 32)
049:25:27 Eisele: Okay.
Comm break.
049:28:24 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7.
049:28:26 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
049:28:27 Eisele: Are you on VHF now? [Pause]
049:28:32 Swigert: Affirmative. We are receiving VHF; we are SIM0 on transmit. [Pause]
049:28:38 Eisele: Okay. Fine. There for a while, it seemed you were only ou S-band. [Long pause]
049:28:50 Swigert: Apollo 7, can you tell us what direction you are pointed at relative to the sun? [Pause]
049:28:58 Eisele: What direction - what? Say again, Jack. Why don't you read our gimbal angles and figure it out? You can probably do it better than we can. [Long pause]
049:29:10 Swigert: Roger.
049:29:12 Eisele: It's coming in the left side window; it's a little bit forward of us. [Pause]
049:29:17 Swigert: Okay.
Long comm break.
049:36:10 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
049:36:21 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
049:36:37 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
049:36:57 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We are going to delay activation of the primary evaporator until Ascension. We will contact you at Ascension in approximately 8 minutes. [Long pause]
049:37:51 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS Antigua.
Long comm break.
ASCENSION (REV 32)
049:47:09 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Long pause]
049:47:47 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Pause]
049:47:55 Cunningham: Roger. This is Apollo 7. We're standing by for your evaporator procedure. I can - - [Pause]
049:48:00 Swigert: Okay. Walt, we're going to wait until we get high hit rate here. We've got a keyhole effect which is going to delay our high bit rate for a minute or so, and then we'll be ready to start. [Long pause]
049:48:11 Cunningham: Roger. [Long pause]
049:49:03 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We're ready to start on the primary evaporator test. You can open the back pressure valve manually for 2 seconds. [Pause]
049:49:12 Cunningham: Are you ready to receive this procedure? [Pause]
049:49:20 Swigert: Okay. You want to put your water valve to AUTO? [Pause]
049:49:26 Cunningham: You want me to decrease for 2 seconds first, don't you? [Pause]
049:49:35 Swigert: Okay. Walt, we want to go AUTO first on the water valve. [Long pause]
049:50:07 Cunningham: Jack, on S-band. [Pause]
049:50:11 Swigert: Okay. Walt, read you five-by. You want to ... [Pause]
049:50:16 Cunningham: The steam pressure came down to .15, and glycol evaporator outlet temperature is coming down. [Pause]
049:50:22 Swigert: Okay. Understand. [Long pause]
049:50:34 Cunningham: I am going to go AUTO on the steam pressure because the glycol evaporator outlet temperature is down. [Pause]
049:50:39 Swigert: Okay. We'd like you to hold it for 15 seconds. [Pause]
049:50:47 Cunningham: Do what?
049:50:50 Swigert: Hold off on putting the steam pressure valve to AUTO for 15 seconds here. [Pause]
049:50:55 Cunningham: Roger. I had it in there; I just took it back.
049:50:58 Swigert: Okay. [Long pause]
049:51:15 Swigert: Okay. Apollo 7, you can put the steam pressure valve to AUTO now. [Pause]
049:51:20 Cunningham: Roger. It's in AUTO. The glycol evaporator outlet TEMP is reading 38 on board. [Pause]
049:51:30 Swigert: Roger. We copy. [Long pause]
049:51:44 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We are about 1 minute LOS; we would like you to continue this procedure; watch the glycol EVAP OUT temperature. If you get amy anomalies, then record it on the high bit rate; we'll pick you up over Tananarive. [Long pause]
049:51:58 Cunningham: Roger. What time for Canaries? [Pause]
049:52:03 Swigert: Tananarive will be - 50 hours, 1 minute. [Long pause]
049:52:42 Swigert: Okay.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control Houston, 49 hours 53 minutes into the flight. I doubt that there will be additional conversation through Ascension. We have been up now since 49 hours and 10 minutes into the flight, in other words, 43 minutes during this swing from Hawaii through Ascension. While there wasn't talk during the entire period, it was a busy period. As we got into the evaporator test to see how well that element of the cooling is working. Some information on the consumables that remains onboard, 755 pounds of propellant in the RCS tanks, the combined tankage reading 755, that is opposed to a take off propellant weight of 1 307 pounds. In the SPS system there remains 8 266 pounds against the take off weight of 9 555 pounds. The oxygen summary is 82 percent remaining in the oxygen tanks onboard I don't have the figure in pounds. 82 percent in each two tanks. At 49 hours, 54 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control in Houston.
TANANARIVE (Rev 32)
050:01:10 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. [Pause]
050:01:14 Eisele: Roger, Jack. And the water boiler seems to be operating normally now.
050:01:17 Swigert: Okay. Real fine.
050:01:20 Eisele: It evaporated normally after we [garble]. [Pause]
050:01:27 Swigert: I think he said it evaporated normally since he left Ascension. I wonder if he is evaporating now.
Long comm break.
050:07:43 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Tananarive; we pick up ARIA 1 in about 3 minutes. We'll have continuous coverage through Carnarvon. [Long pause]
050:07:54 Eisele: Apollo 7, Roger. [Long pause]
050:08:37 Eisele: This is Apollo 7. [Pause]
050:08:41 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
Comm break.
Apollo Control here at 50 hours 8 minutes into the flight. Via Tananarive we had this conversation.
And this is Apollo Control. That concluded the conversation and while ARIA is available, apparently there are no plans to carry any further conversations with the crew. Earlier we gave you a citation from the amount of - the percentage of oxygen remaining, 82 percent, in pounds that goes like this: tank 1, 265 pounds of oxygen; tank 2, 268. At 50 hours and 10 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control Houston.
ARIA 1 (REV 32)
050:10:34 Swigert: ARIA 1, go REMOTE.

Apollo Control, Houston here; 50 hours, 17 minutes. We are talking to Apollo 7 through Carnarvon.
CARNARVON (REV 32)
050:16:56 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
050:17:00 Schirra: Roger, Houston. [Long pause]
050:17:32 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We have a CSM and S-IVB state vector update we'd like to send you. Would you go to ACCEPT? [Pause]
050:17:40 Schirra: You have it.
050:17:42 Swigert: Coming up. [Long pause]
050:18:08 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
050:18:11 Swigert: Go ahead.
050:18:13 Schirra: In the flight plan, we have AOS Hawaii at about 5 plus 45. [Pause]
050:18:19 Swigert: Roger.
050:18:20 Schirra: Control test.
050:18:23 Swigert: Roger.
050:18:24 Schirra: It took us 20 minutes. We performed that during the tracking exercise for the rendezvous. I'd like to hold off that type of PPO until after we have our third burn. [Long pause]
050:18:38 Swigert: Okay. Stand by.
050:18:40 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause]
050:19:05 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We concur on delaying the attitude control test until after burn 3. [Pause]
050:19:13 Unidentifiable crewmember: Roger. I think we met the requirement, Jack, but if we can check the data from the previous revs, we might not have to do that one. [Pause]
050:19:20 Swigert: All right. Let's do that. We'll check it. [Long pause]
050:19:44 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
050:19:47 Schirra: Go ahead, Jack.
050:19:49 Swigert: We're trying to get an inertial attitude hold angle that we would like you to go to to further evaluate this primary evaporator, and we'll try to get you these angles early so you can take your time maneuvering there. What we want to do is heat up these radiators as much as possible, and it won't have to be a tight attitude hold at all, just want to get as maximum a heat on the radiator as we can to give us a lot of confidence in that primary evaporator. [Long pause]
050:20:19 Schirra: Roger. What time spread are you talkin about?
050:20:21 Swigert: Next stateside pass.
050:20:23 Schirra: Wilco.
Comm break.
050:21:47 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
050:21:50 Schirra: Go ahead.
050:21:51 Swigert: Roger. We have roll, pitch, and yaw gimbal agles for this evaporator evaluation. [Pause]
050:21:59 Schirra: Go.
050:22:00 Swigert: Okay. Roll 218, pitch 129, yaw 18. [Long pause]
050:22:13 Schirra: Jack, is that 18 degrees?
050:22:15 Swigert: Roger. 018, excuse me. Yaw is 018. [Long pause]
050:22:28 Swigert: You can maneuver there as slowly as possible and set up the MAX deadband, and we'll evaluate this over the States. [Long pause]
050:22:40 Schirra: Okay. What time would you like this new attitude? [Pause]
050:22:50 Swigert: For the day pass, Wally, over the States. [Pause]
050:22:54 Schirra: Okay. It'll be [garble] approximately 50 hours and 45 minutes. [Pause]
050:23:00 Swigert: Okay. Real fine.
050:23:03 Unidentifiable crewmember: I'll read back: 218 roll, 129 pitch, and yaw. [Pause]
050:23:08 Swigert: That's 218 roll, 129 pitch, 018 yaw. [Pause]
050:23:16 Schirra: I have that.
050:23:18 Swigert: Okay. [Pause]
050:23:24 Swigert: And, 7, we have finished with the loads; we have verified them. The computer is yours. [Pause]
050:23:33 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
050:23:38 Schirra: Jack, do you have a NAV update for us? [Pause]
050:23:42 Swigert: Say again.
050:23:44 Schirra: Do you have a NAV update for us after that state vector load? [Pause]
050:23:50 Swigert: Roger. That was CSM and S-IVB state vector. [Pause]
050:23:55 Schirra: Roger. Don't we do the NAV update to validate?
050:23:58 Swigert: Okay. Stand by. [Long pause]
050:24:11 Swigert: I have your NAV cheek; are you ready to cody? [Pause]
050:24:19 Schirra: Stand by. Okay. Go.
050:24:22 Swigert: Okay. Sextant track time 051 plus 35 plus 0000 minus 2779 plus 02505 1549. [Long pause]
050:24:49 Schirra: Roger. 051 35 0000 minus 2779 plus 02505 1549. Over. [Pause]
050:24:59 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
050:25:06 Schirra: Did you read that, Jack?
050:25:08 Swigert: That's a correct readback; that's 154.9. [Pause]
050:25:14 Schirra: 154.9. Roger. And copy [garble]. [Pause]
050:25:19 Swigert: Okay.
050:25:22 Eisele: Okay. It looks like we're right on, doesn't it? [Pause]
050:25:27 Schirra: That's speedy work up here, Dorm. [Pause]
050:25:33 Swigert: Stand by.
050:25:35 Schirra: [Gabrle] the DSKY. You've got an update.
Very long comm break.
Apollo Control here at 50 hours 42 minutes into the flight. Momentarily we expect to be talking to Apollo 7 through Hawaii. Lets listen.
HAWAII through ANTIGUA (REV 32)
050:43:13 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. [Pause]
050:43:18 Schirra: Roger, Houston. We're drifting in attitude now.
050:43:21 Swigert: Roger. Real fine. Wally, when we hit the States, we'd like to switch over to a deadband as long as we are holding attitude for this radiator - or evaporator evaluation. We'd like to switch over to a deadband, and we'll kill that DTO, that G&N attitude control test at the same time. I will give you a call over California when we would like to set in the rate. [Long pause]
050:43:54 Pogue: And it...
050:43:55 Schirra: The deadband is expensive; it's about 5 pounds an hour, and we've done that during the rendezvous maneuver. [Pause]
050:44:04 Pogue: Roger. We understand that. This will only be for a minimum of 10 minutes. [Pause]
050:44:09 Schirra: Bill, that's about 1 pound.
050:44:11 Pogue: I mean...
050:44:12 Eisele: Prior to the SPS burns about 5 to 10 minutes each. - We're saying that SPS will be depleted. [Long pause]
050:44:32 Schirra: And by the way, Houston, Hawaii is part of the United States now. [Pause]
050:44:38 Swigert: Roger. I understand, Wally.
050:44:40 Schirra: You are showing your age, Jack.
Comm break.
050:47:27 Schirra: Houston, Houston, Apollo 7. [Pause]
050:47:31 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
050:47:33 Schirra: Roger. There is Somthing we have never made note of before. It happened during spacecraft tests and does here as well. When the twelfth maneuver is put in, the gimbal drive reflects that maneuver - even though the clutch current is OFF - plus or minus about half a degree. [Long pause]
050:47:53 Swigert: Roger. I understand.
050:47:55 Schirra: It's just an anomaly; might surprise subsequent crews. [Pause]
050:48:00 Swigert: Okay. We copy.
050:48:01 Schirra: No problem. [Long pause]
050:48:29 Schirra: Houston, the reason we are resisting burning up fuel is that we're not really - [Long pause]
050:49:08 Schirra: We just had a good view of a contrail en route to Hawaii. [Pause]
050:49:12 Swigert: Roger. Opposite omni, 7.
050:49:15 Schirra: Roger.
050:49:17 Swigert: Wally, we are having some more discussion on that MIN rate over the States here. We'll let you know. [Pause]
050:49:26 Schirra: We're right on the border line on fuel as far as making our line good. [Pause]
050:49:31 Swigert: Roger. We understand.
050:49:34 Schirra: We're doing the next steps later.
Comm break.
050:51:00 Communication Technician: Huntsville [garble] two wheel log, valid range.
Long comm break.
050:57:04 Slayton: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
050:57:09 Schirra: Go ahead.
050:57:11 Slayton: Roger. We'd still like you to go ahead and set in that MIN rate, complete this G&N attitude control test. This will be the mtnimum cost fuel-wise right now. [Long pause]
050:57:22 Schirra: Roger The [garble]you got here is exactly the same. [Pause]
050:57:26 Slayton: Roger. We understand.
050:57:28 Unidentifiable crewmember: Okay. I don't think you people understand real well. We are still testing. [Pause]
050:57:37 Slayton: Roger. Understand. [Long pause]
050:57:50 Schirra: All [garble] be prepared to debrief on this subject when we get back. [Pause]
050:57:58 Slayton: Yes, sir.
050:57:58 Schirra: It's in hold now. [Long pause]
050:58:14 Slayton: Roger. We are timing right now. We will give you a MARK in 10 minutes, and the test will be complete. [Pause]
050:58:20 Schirra: Roger.
Long comm break.
051:01:47 Schirra: Deke, you look like you're wide open today. [Pause]
051:01:52 Slayton: Roger.
051:01:54 Schirra: You got a little spotty cue over Dallas, a little spotty cue offshore. Looks like you have about three- or four-tenths coverage today. [Long pause]
051:02:05 Slayton: Okay. I haven't been outside for about 6 hours, so I don't know.
Comm break.
051:03:51 Schirra: Jack, after this G&N burn, do you want us to hold it in SCS like programmed? [Pause]
HAWAII through ANTIGUA (REV 33)
051:04:01 Swigert: Roger. Wally, after we get through this, you've got about 4 minutes left, then hold attitude in the cheapest way possible there. [Pause]
051:04:10 Schirra: Roger.
051:04:13 Swigert: And as soon as we hit the night pass, you are on your own.
Comm break.
051:05:18 Schirra: Grand Bahamas looked beautiful today. [Pause]
051:05:22 Swigert: Say again, Wally.
051:05:23 Schirra: The Grand Bahamas looked beautiful today. We took a lot of good pictures with the Hasselblad. We got one of Houston, one of Tampa; that's about the rate. It takes about 3 minutes to recock it. [Long pause]
051:05:38 Swigert: 'Roger. We copy.
051:05:40 Schirra: Probably the loop inside is jamming it up. It's in the box itself, not in the lens shutter mechanism and not in the magazine. [Pause]
051:05:48 Swigert: Okay. We copy that. [Pause]
051:05:57 Schirra: We recomend carrying at least two of these boxes along and the accessories to go with them. [Long pause]
051:06:08 Swigert: Okay. We copy that.
051:06:10 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
051:06:14 Eisele: Houston, the water boiler hasn't been boiling since we been - have you been putting all the heat on the radiator, or making believe it's cool? Over. [Pause]
051:06:24 Swigert: We've been trying to get the MAX heat on the radiator; we expect it to start boiling here. We are showing a RAD OUT now of 50. [Pause]
051:06:31 Eisele: Roger. So am I, but my glycol evaporator outlet sensor's still seeing 48. [Pause]
051:06:38 Schirra: Jack, give me a reading when we go off this DAP control. [Pause]
051:06:42 Swigert: Roger. You have got about a mtnute and three-quarters.
051:06:45 Schirra: Okay. Then I'll fly in SCS for how long? [Pause]
051:06:50 Eisele: Looks like it's starting to boil. Let's see if it overshoots. [Pause]
051:06:57 Swigert: Roger. We concur.
051:06:59 Schirra: Now long will I stay in the SCS mode? [Pause]
051:07:03 Swigert: Stand by one. [Pause]
051:07:07 Eisele: Are you observing my steam pressure now? [Pause]
051:07:11 Swigert: Affirmative. And darkness occurs, Wally, about 51 25, 51 25. [Long pause]
051:07:22 Schirra: Then we are going to stop holding attitude, right?
051:07:24 Swigert: Affirmative.
051:07:25 Schirra: Okay. [Long pause]
051:07:43 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7. Are you reading my primary evaporator now? [Pause]
051:07:47 Swigert: Affirmative, 7. [Pause]
051:07:52 Eisele: Roger. Did you note the evaporator outlet temperature overshot all the way down to about 34. [Pause]
051:08:01 Swigert: We confirm, and we show it coming back up. [Long pause]
051:08:20 Swigert: Okay. Apollo 7, we've completed 10 minutes in MIN deadband; you can come out of MIN deadband and go to the cheapest way possible for attitude hold. [Long pause]
051:08:31 Schirra: Roger. SCS. [Long pause]
051:09:20 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
051:09:27 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7. Go ahead.
051:09:29 Swigert: Roger. We feel that for all purposes your primary evaporator is working normally. You can discontinue attitude holding. [Long pause]
051:09:48 Schirra: Roger. All chanels OFF.
051:09:49 Swigert: Roger.
051:09:52 Eisele: Do you want us to go ahead and operate the glycol evaporator then, and see if we have a reoccurence of the earlier trouble? [Pause]
051:10:00 Swigert: That's affirmative, and we will match it, too.
051:10:03 Eisele: Thank you.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 51 hours, 15 minutes into the flight. You heard during that pass that any and all consideration - any and all concerns about the primary evaporator and suspected problems have been put to bed. The primary eYaporator was pronounced working normally in all respects by the ground and by the crew in space. We also heard Wally Schirra report he had gotten several good pictures. He said he thought he got a good shot of Houston and a good shot of Tampa, Florida, and explained some difficulty they had had with a mechanism on the camera, which I didn't fully understand. At - with the Spacecraft half-way across the Atlantic Ocean, we're 51 hours, 16 minutes into the flight, on the 33rd revolution. This is Apollo Control Houston.
051:17:59 Cunningham (onboard): 10 clicks of water for the LMP at 5 - at 51 hours and 17 minutes.
ASCENSION (REV 33)
051:20:16 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Pause]
051:20:21 Schirra: Apo.llo 7. Roger. Loud and clear. [Pause]
051:20:26 Swigert: We're standing by. [Pause]
051:20:31 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read?
051:20:33 Swigert: I read you five-by. We're standing by. [Pause]
051:20:37 Schirra: I took the camera apart and used some nose cream and cleaned up some of the inner gears, and it looks like it is going to do all right now. [Long pause]
051:20:48 Swigert: Roger. Copy. And I have a flight plan update on that - the PAD for the star - sextant star count whenever you are ready to copy. [Long pause]
051:21:11 Schirra: Go ahead with your flight plan update, Jack.
051:21:13 Swigert: Okay. GET SR will be 53 plus 36, roll will be 40, pitch will be 92. Delay that roll. Roll will be 4, pitch will be 92, yaw will be 359. GET of sunset minus 12 will be 54 plus 18, roll will be 184, pitch 97, yaw 359. [Long pause]
051:22:05 Unidentifiable cremember: Roger. GET sunrise 53 plus 36, attitude 004 for roll, pitch 092, yaw 359. Sunrise minus 12 minutes will be 54 plus 18, roll 184, pitch 097, yaw 359. [Long pause]
051:22:28 Swigert: Roger. That's correct.
051:22:31 Schirra: Okay. Houston, Apollo 7. [Pause]
051:22:35 Swigert: Go ahead, Wally.
051:22:37 Schirra: Roger. Me still have reservations about the SPS angine. It looks good to us so far, but we don't have any data from you, though. [Long pause]
051:22:50 Swigert: Okay. Stand by.
Long comm break.
051:26:23 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
051:26:27 Schirra: Go ahead.
051:26:28 Swigert: Wally, could you confirm your reservations about the SPS engine? Does that have to do with the GPI movement that you observed? [Long pause]
051:26:40 Schirra: Negative. We had a mission rule beforehand with the Flight Director that we would not go into the SMS (which is reserved) until we knew that we had a good SPS engine. [Long pause]
051:26:55 Swigert: Okay. We copy.
051:26:57 Schirra: Roger. I'd like one more burn...
051:27:00 Swigert: Okay.
051:27:02 Schirra: ...At this point.
051:27:04 Swigert: We understand. Stand by. We'll be - discuss that.
Very long comm break.
051:37:06 Cunningham (onboard): Gyro-torquing angles are minus 0.420, minus 0.175, plus 0.149.
TANANARIVE (REV 33)
051:37:34 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. [Pause]
051:37:41 Eisele: Roger. We got a report [garble] angles for the realignment: minus .420, minus .175, plus .149. Are you [garble] Antares and Peacock, a triangle difference of four balls 1. [Long pause]
051:38:03 Swigert: Roger. Donn, I've got a .175, a .149; I didn't catch the first one. [Pause]
051:38:13 Eisele: The first one was a minus .420. [Pause]
051:38:17 Swigert: .420, a triangle difference of four balls 1, and say again the stars. [Pause]
051:38:25 Cunningham: A. Antares and Peacock; And on the angles, the first was a minus, second was a minus, the third was a plus. [Pause]
051:38:34 Swigert: Roger. Copy. And Walt, is Wally on the line? [Pause]
051:38:42 Cunningham (onboard): Yes.
051:38:43 Schirra (onboard): Go ahead.
051:38:45 Schirra (onboard): Go ahead, Jack.
051:38:50 Schirra (onboard): CDR here.
051:39:01 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
051:39:05 Schirra: Schirra speaking.
051:39:07 Swigert: Roger. About the SPS problem: after discussion down here, our feeling is that the SPS is Go. Hovewer, we have a DAP service module RCS deorbit capability at the present time, and we are within 10 feet per second of an SCS service module RCS deorbit capability. [Long pause]
051:39:39 Schirra: Roger. That was our figuring, too. We'd like to hold that reserve as much as possible after the full turn. We'll get to [garble]. [Pause]
051:39:48 Schirra (onboard): ...lower perigee here, I think we'll feel much more comfortable.
051:39:57 Swigert: Wally, we aren't able to read you this time. We'll pick you up with that last transmission over Carnarvon. [Pause]
051:40:06 Schirra: Roger.
Very long comm break.
051:43:31 Schirra (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7.
051:43:46 Eisele (onboard): Walt's doing his second fine alignment. He did pretty well once he figured out that there weren't any numbers pasted on the star ball.
And this is Apollo Control; 51 hours, 51 minutes into the flight. We will be in touch with the spacecraft through Carnarvon; there goes the first call.
CARNARVON (REV 33)
051:51:43 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
051:51:48 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
051:51:54 Schirra: Houston, could you read our DSKY then? [Pause]
051:52:01 Lunney: Roger. Flight. No data yet.
051:52:03 Swigert: Apollo 7, we don't have data yet. [Pause]
051:52:07 Schirra: Roger. We have a display. It will take hold in a second. This is our gyro torquing angle. [Pause]
051:52:15 Swigert: Okay. Stand by. [Long pause]
051:52:29 Cunningham: Houston. I did the fine align check and used Peacock and Rigel, star angle difference five balls, torquing angles plus 021 minus 049 plus 017. Over. [Long pause]
051:52:49 Swigert: Okay. Copy that, Walt. [Pause]
051:52:56 Schirra: He's back. [Long pause]
051:53:31 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
051:53:34 Schirra: Go ahead.
051:53:35 Swigert: Can you give me a GET - an approximate GET that you did that fine align so that we can compute some gyro drift rates? [Long pause]
051:53:46 Schirra: Roger. The line was completed at about 51 40. [Pause]
051:53:52 Swigert: 51 40.
051:53:54 Schirra: 51. Fine align check. [Pause]
051:53:59 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
051:54:02 Eisele: Do you want the first one or the second one, Jack? He did two of them. [Pause]
051:54:09 Swigert: Stand by.
051:54:11 Eisele: The first one was about 51 40. I think that's the one you want for your drift check. [Long pause]
051:54:33 Swigert: Okay, 7. The first one, 51 40, will be fine. [Pause]
051:54:38 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause]
051:55:12 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Do you also have the time you did the fine align check so we can get that one, too? [Pause]
051:55:19 Eisele: That was at 51 51.
051:55:22 Swigert: Okay.
051:55:23 Schirra: Got that.
051:55:25 Swigert: Roger. Copy that. [Long pause]
051:55:39 Swigert: And - Apollo 7, Houstcn - we feel that on the basis of what Donn did on the daylight align test, that you can delete that P52 which comes at 55 plus 00 in the flight plan. Do you concur? [Long pause]
051:55:59 Schirra: Stand by.
051:56:02 Eisele: [Garble] Roger. We concur. [Pause]
051:56:06 Swigert: Okay. You can delete it.
051:56:08 Schirra: Roger.
051:56:10 Eisele: Jack, if we happen to be in a favorable latitude, I might take another crack at it, but... [Pause]
051:56:16 Swigert: That's fine with us.
051:56:18 Eisele: Okay. [Long pause]
051:56:59 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
051:57:01 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
051:57:03 Schirra: Roger. Can you talk about the SPS results now that you had observed on the ground? [Pause]
051:57:09 Swigert: Go ahead.
051:57:11 Schirra: Negative. What did you observe? [Pause]
051:57:19 Swigert: Okay. Stand by. [Long pause]
051:57:51 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. On the - we relooked at all the strip charts on the SPS operation: ball valves, the temperatures, everything on the SPS appears normal. [Long pause]
051:58:07 Schirra: Very good. It seems that way here.
051:58:08 Swigert: Okay. Real fine...
051:58:10 Schirra: [Garble] information, I would like to have the number 3 burn before I give up the SM RCS budget. [Pause]
051:58:19 Swigert: Say again on the SPS number 3 burn. [Pause]
051:58:24 Schirra: I would like to get the SPS number 3 burn in before I eat into the SM RCS deorbit budget. [Pause]
051:58:34 Swigert: Roger. We're going to look at that. [Pause]
051:58:38 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
051:58:48 Swigert: We are about 1 minute LOS Carnarvon; will pick you up in Guam in about 5 minutes. [Pause]

And we're just about, or have lost signal through Carnarvon so we shut the wire down now; we have had additional discussion here regarding propellant paths. You recall that this is a subject that is difficult to understand without looking at the charts but we have essentially two ways to leave orbit and return to Earth. One through what we call the hybrid mode, using the RCS thrusters and the other using the SPS engine and we are slightly under one red line but the controllers here feel like we are more than adequate in the other mode and that has been a point under discussion between the crew and the control center these last several passes. At 51 hours, 1 minute into the flight, this is Apollo Control Houston.

052:18:18 Schirra: Hello, Houston. Roger. [Garble] that S-IVB - I think what happened is the auto optics quit working, or it wasn't working right, and I saw it go out of the top of the sextant, and I never was able to recover it. [Long pause]

052:18:37 Schirra: Up to the time it happened, it seemed to be working pretty well. I had done a few marks, and it appeared to be pulling it in a little closer to the center although not as well as it had done on the previous run. [Long pause]

054:12:18 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS. Tananarive at 46 minutes.
Very long comm break.
054:12:33 Cunningham (onboard): Did you read?
054:12:43 Cunningham (onboard): Magazine Q, frames 42 through 44 were taken of Las Brisas Harbor, Acapulco, Mexico. They were taken at 54 hours and 10 minutes into the flight.
054:18:54 Eisele (onboard): Roger, there are four stars hidden dimly in view at sunset minus 12 minutes.
054:19:11 Eisele (onboard): These stars are just sort of visible at the - if you look off to one side, you can see them a little bit. Dark adapting wouldn't do any good for this particular test, because there's so much daylight in the instruments and the telescope. The same light pattern I described before - an angular pattern around the edge of the thing and a broad belt across the center plus a big blob down at the bottom - it's not quite as bright as it was during the other test [garble], but it is there, and it's going to prevent me from being dark adapted.
054:22:29 Eisele (onboard): I picked up about 25 stars at sunset minus 8 minutes. The light - no identifiable constellatioss at this time, I don't know what part of the sky I'm looking at. I can take a look at somewhere at the southern hemisphere, but - in the vicinity of Acamar or Achernar, whichever it is, there's this big void spot down there; it's hard to find stars in.
054:23:30 Eisele (onboard): One of the things that obscured this star data is the fact whenever the jet fires or the overboard vent vents, you get a lot of particles that reflect light, and you can't see anything except that. All I see is a big field of bright spots out there.
054:26:08 Eisele (onboard): This at sunset minus 4 minutes and still obliterated by the field of particles, not possible to see the stars for the little bits and pieces coming out of the vent.
This is Apollo Control 54:29 into the mission. We have about 6 1/2 minutes of tape from the tracking station passes during the news conference. Start back at the Guam station. The signal strength is a little bit low, but CMP Donn Eisele does discuss briefly during the Guam pass the telescope star count that he is doing. Indicates that he is able to see some stars, at least a little while after they come out of the darkness. We will play that tape now.
054:29:50 Cunningham (onboard): Okay, this is sunset. We still have the same problem, these particles are flying around and there's no way that I can - particles are still flying around at sunset, and there's no way I can distinguish stars from particles. I think the reason we didn't see these at the test at sunrise Was that the spacecraft has been running cool through the dark side of the Earth and probably wasn't boiling any water at that time. That terminates the star count.
Apollo Control at 54 hours, 37 minutes. That is the end of the tape. Apollo 7 has started its 34th revolution a little while ago. About 10 minutes away from acquisition at Tananarive now. We will come back up at that time.
054:43:10 Cunningham (onboard): CDR, 10 clicks. And an afterthought, one Lomotil.
This is Apollo Control; 54 hours, 46 minutes into the mission. Tananarive is about to acquire Apollo 7. We'll monitor this pass.

054:47:08 Cunningham: At 54 35, we powered down to the drifting site configuration, and I have another food bag failure to report. [Pause]
054:47:17 Evans: Roger. How did the second one fail?
054:47:20 Cunningham: I had the second one, and it was A3, AOB for the LMP - the chocolate pudding. But the failure occurred at the spout where it comes out at the eating end, and it seems to have given away near the [garble] begins. [Long pause]
054:48:00 Cunningham: Did you receive, Houston? [Pause]
054:48:06 Evans: Walt, I got part of that, but I couldn't get it all. Chocolate pudding bag failed, but I'm not sure how, yet. [Pause]
054:48:12 Cunningham: Okay. It failed at the eating end. It was not one of the external seams, but it made it impossible to eat it. [Pause]

054:50:03 Evans: Roger. Dorm is the big eater.
054:50:06 Schirra: That's a fact. [Pause]
054:50:10 Schirra: We've been on the Exer-Genie now as much as 30 minutes at a time, and we've doubled the workload on it, and there's not much more we can do. If we're not hungry, we don't eat. I think we're all feeling pretty chipper; there's no discomfort up here. My cold is improved considerably. [Long pause]
054:50:36 Evans: Roger. That's good. [Long pause]
054:50:50 Schirra: A subject that we are concerned about is the chlorination of the drinking water. We're drinking about as much as we can. I'd say that we've drunk enough water to lower the quantity sufficiently to have a chlorine check. [Long pause]
054:51:11 Evans: Say again, Wally.
054:51:11 Cunningham (onboard): Roger, we're due to add more chlorine to our potable water. We have not consumed enough of it to warrant adding a lot of chlorine to it.
054:51:36 Cunningham (onboard): We can't say subjectively - we do not object ! to the taste at this point.
054:51:45 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Say again about the chlorine and potable water.
054:51:48 Cunningham (onboard): Roger, we query the advisability of adding chlorine on schedule to the potable water. At this point, there is not an objectionable taste to the water.

Mission Control Houston. We've had LOS at Tananarive. Much of that transmission was a little hard to copy. The quality wasn't too good. So the high points we were able to copy reported a second food-bag failure - the chocolate pudding bag. They reported that they had powered down as scheduled on the flight plan. Walt Cunningham reported getting some good pictures while on the West Coast of Mexico. And the commander, Wally Schirra, reports that they've been eating as much as they can get down and that works out to about two meals a day. He also reported that his cold has improved considerably. At 54 hours 56 minutes this is Apollo Control.

055:10:16 Evans: Roger. You're a lot better this time. Can you say again your question about the potable water and chlorination? [Pause]
055:10:23 Schirra: Yes, Ron. We - adding chlorine to the water quantity that has not decreased since we've been taken off practically. And if the taste of the chlorine has not bothered us yet, but we feel we haven't taken enough water out of there to warrant adding chlorine on a 24-hour basis. [Pause]

055:12:27 Cunningham: At approximately 20 minutes ago, the prime rate evaporatQr ran into the same kind of problem it had earlier in the flight. The steam pressure went all the way dovn peg low, and they could not increase it by going to MANUAL and the INCREASE switch. I reserviced it for 2 minutes and operated manually for another couple of minutes and finally went back to AUTO. And it's been running fine for the last 20 minutes - maybe longer - I guess more like about 30 minutes ago. [Long pause]
055:13:07 Evans: Roger. We copy. [Pause]
055:13:13 Cunningham: Apparently, it's a case of the evaporator drying out instead of the evaporator being frozen.

This is Apollo Control; 55 hours, 41 minutes into the mission. Apollo 7 went through the Huntsville pass without any conversation. The CAPCOM you heard pass up the score on the Oiler's game was Captain Allen B. Shepherd, this Country's first man in space who came in a few moments ago and is sitting down on the CAPCOM console with the regular CAPCOM, Ron Evans, and astronaut John Young is also on that console. We have a little bit more information here on that telescope star count, Ron Evans reports that at the time that Donn Eisele reported seeing about 50 stars Apollo 7 was approximately four minutes into daylight. At the time he reported he could see ten stars he was about ten minutes into daylight. At 55 hours, 42 minutes, this is Mission Control Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 56 hours into the mission. Apollo 7 started its 36th revolution just a few minutes ago. It is now down over South America. The spacecraft has been out of touch with tracking station since it left the Huntsville area - Huntsville tracking ship area in the Pacific. And we will be out of touch for about another 20 minutes. At that time we will be in range of the Tananarive station. This is Mission Control Houston.

This is Apollo Control at 57 hours, 13 minutes, and we've had LOS at the Huntsville which had a slight bit of overlapping coverage with Hawaii. Apollo 7 is on the orbits now that sweep down over the Southern Hemisphere, takes it off much of the tracking range. We have a very low elevation pass 1 degree at Tananarive. We may try to raise the spacecraft there, but the flight plan does not call for any further communication till We get to the Mercury, the tracking ship in the West Pacific. The Mercury is due to acquire at 58 hours, 19 minutes, 33 seconds. Flight plan activity scheduled during this long period of silence includes purge, an oxygen purge of the fuel cell. We completed the hydrogen purge an hour or so ago. The crew is also scheduled to chlorinate the portable water during this time and to change the change the lithium hydroxide canister. This block update that you just heard passed up this time is the information the flight crew would need to reenter on those orbits on which they're out of touch mainly with the range. We passed up that necessary information for the next several revolutions so that in the event of a contingency that would have that information and would be able to reenter without being in direct touch with the tracking station.

This is Apollo Control 59 hours into the mission. Restone has LOS now. As you heard the AC bus 1 light came ON now. A bus is the - an electrical distribution system. Walt Cunningham reported no overload, but he wondered if inverter number 1 might be putting out an over voltage. The power comes out of the fuel cells DC, direct current, and these inverters invert it to alternating current. As you heard, the cognizant flight controllers here have taken these clues they were able from the crew and are now working the problem. That is not considered a real problem at this time, but the they would like to track down the source of this anomaly if they can. The next station to acquire will be Ascension at 59 hours, 19 minutes. This is Mission Control, houston.

060:05:38 Cunningham: We have to know the exact position of the rendezvous radar heater and power switch so we can use the rendezvous radar self-test. We don't have that on board with us. [Long pause]
060:05:53 Evans: Roger. Awful hard to understand. Something about a power switch, and I'll guess which one. I'll find out. [Pause]
060:05:58 Cunningham: Rendezvous radar power switch, and it's a prepositioned switch, the other end of it [garble]. [Pause]
060:06:07 Evans: Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, 60 hours, 6 minutes, Guam has LOS now. Apollo 7 will be within range of the tracking ship Redstone at 60 hours, 26 minutes. This is Mission Control Houston.

060:26:27 Schirra (onboard): Apollo 7. Loud and clear. Go ahead.
060:26:49 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston, Redstone.
060:26:52 Schirra: Roger. Read you. How me?
060:26:54 Evans: Roger. A little weak, but clear.
060:26:57 Cunningham: Roger. Do you have the data on the radar transponder test? [Pause]
060:27:02 Evans: Affirmative. Are you ready to copy? [Pause]
060:27:10 Schirra: Go ahead.
060:27:11 Evans: Roger. The rendezvous transponder power switch: you put it to HEATER for 1 minute and then to POWER for the self-test. By the way, you leave it 24 minutes in HEATERR if you are going to really operate it. System test left hand, the TRANSPONDER, right hand to Alpha. Indicator should be 1 to 5 volts. Systems test right hand to Bravo. Indicator 2, plus or minus 1 volt. Systems test right hand to Charlie. Disregard the indicator. Systems test right hand to Dog. Indicator should be 0 to 4.5 volts. Over.

060:28:40 Schirra: Do you read, Apollo 7?
060:28:42 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Roger. Read you now. [Pause]
060:28:46 Schirra: Roger. You might try it again. You were broken the first time, and I couldn't read you at all. [Pause]
060:28:51 Evans: Roger. Rendezvous transponder power switch goes to HEATER for 1 minute, then to POWER.
Comm break.
060:30:39 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Is the COMM any better now? [Pause]
060:30:44 Schirra: Roger. Sounds clear now. You want to try to read that off again?
060:30:47 Evans: Roger. The radar transponder power switch goes to HEATER for 1 minute, then to POWER. Systems test left hand to TRANSPONDER, right hand to Alpha. Your indicator, 1 to 5 volts. 7, Houston. You copy so far? [Long pause]
060:31:31 Schirra: Let's try to pick you up at Ascension. [Pause]

This is Apollo Control at 60 hours, 35 minutes. Apollo 7 beyond range of the Redstone now. That information that the Cap Com Ron Evans was attempting to pass up is the procedure for onboard testing of the radar transponder which will be used in connection of the Lunar Module radar tomorrow. The LM radar itself is at the White Sands, New Mexico test facility. It will attempt to lock on to the transponder onboard the Command Module as the Command Module comes over the White Sands area. Next station to acquire will be Ascension. At 60 hours, 52 minutes this is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo control at 60 hours 52 minutes into the mission. Apollo 7 coming up on the Ascension Island tracking station, now. We'll listen through this pass.

060:53:08 Evans: Roger. I can continue with that transponder check now if you want. [Pause]
060:53:12 Schirra: I think I have the data for you if you're ready to copy. [Pause]
060:53:16 Schirra (onboard): Will give you radiator and heater pad.
060:53:17 Evans: Roger. Ready.
060:53:19 Schirra: It's the heater tubes. Alpha 3.2, Bravo 1.8, Charlie .45, Delta 0.
060:53:20 Schirra (onboard): I've got 3.3. Over.
060:53:32 Evans: Roger. I'll read back: 3.2, 1.8, 0.44, and 0. [Pause]
060:53:41 Schirra: That is correct. DELTA-V to tab over to .1 at the most. [Pause]
060:53:47 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
060:54:02 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Be advised of warmup time for the real test on that thing is 24 minutes. [Pause]

060:54:37 Schirra: It's 2 and 1/2 hours after injection. [Pause]
060:54:42 Evans: Roger. We understand.
060:54:45 Schirra: We've been asking about this for a long time, and now we will just have to wait or consider using the survival kit water if it's necessary. [Long pause]

060:58:42 Evans: Say again, Wally. [Pause]
060:58:46 Schirra: Roger. We've got the cable all hooked up. [Pause]
060:58:50 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
060:58:55 Schirra: We're getting down to keeping only one man, on watch at a time, and that's going to answer a lot. He's not sleeping, Just milling around, staring, and housekeeping. [Long pause]
060:59:16 Schirra: [Garble]. [Pause]
060:59:22 Evans: Say again.
060:59:24 Schirra: You want LMP now? [Pause]
060:59:28 Cunningham: How are you reading my heart? [Pause]
060:59:34 Evans: Stand by. [Pause]
060:59:39 Cunningham: Is my heart coming in five-by-five? [Long pause]
060:59:50 Evans: Roger, Walt. We have it now. Thank you. [Long pause]
061:00:47 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS; Mercury at 28. [Pause]

Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 61 hours, 1 minute. Ascension Island has LOS now. Here in the Control Center we are getting ready to hand over to the next shift of flight controllers. The next station to acquire Apollo 7 will be the tracking ship Mercury. At 61 hours 28 minutes This is Mission control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control. There will be a change of shift press conference here in Houston in approximately 15 minutes. That would be 20 minutes to the hour. This is Apollo Control.
061:12:48 Schirra (onboard): Frame number 58 was of the shoreline of the Arabian coast.
061:22:13 Cunninghgam (onboard): At 61 hours and 5 minutes into the flight, we had a MASTER ALARM and no caution-warning light lighted. And we didn't know really what caused that. At 61 hours and 22 minutes into the flight, we had a MASTER ALARM; AC BUS 1 and AC BUS 2 caution-warning lights came on, and [garble] both buses, all phases. The voltage was less than 90. Both buses reset and the voltage on all phases, all buses [garble] manual [garble] in between 114 and 116.
061:23:12 Schirra (onboard): Other than that, we have no problems.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 61 hours, 28 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We are coming upon acquisition with the Mercury tracking ship within a few seconds. Let's standby for that conversation.
MERCURY (REV 39)
061:30:00 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Mercury.
061:30:03 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read? [Pause]
061:30:11 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Go. [Pause]
061:30:15 Schirra: Roger. We had a traumatic experience up here that kept us up half the night. [Garble] one of the reasons is we had two regs shut down and power outage which came back immediately afterwards. And we had a ground [garble] right after that which didn't last too long and now a read-out on the caution and warning panel. Over. [Long pause]
061:30:45 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. I will call you again in about 30 seconds. The signal is very poor. All copied is something about caution and warning panel. [Long pause]
061:31:26 Schirra (onboard): Houston. Apollo 7. Do you read?
061:31:32 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. You are unreadable right now.
061:31:33 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7. Say again. [Pause]
Comm break.
061:31:42 Schirra (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7. Say again.
This is - this is Apollo Control, 61 hours, 32 minutes. Communications have not been as desirable as could be wished for on this pass. We are still standing by live. It is possible since this pass runs into the Guam station, that will be the point where we will get better communications. Let's standby.
GUAM (REV 39)
061:34:00 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read?
061:34:03 Schirra: Okay. Did you read my last? [Garble]. [Pause]
061:34:07 Schirra (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7.
061:34:15 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. I read you about strength one and virtually unreadable. [Pause]
061:34:23 Schirra: Roger. Do you read me now?
061:34:25 Pogue: Roger. That is much better. Go. [Pause]
061:34:30 Schirra: Apollo 7, say again.
061:34:32 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. At acquisition Mercury, you gave me a transmission. All I copied was something about caution and warning panel. Would you say again? [Long pause]
061:34:48 Schirra: Houston, this is Apollo 7. Just prior to crossing the Red Sea, we lost AC bus 1 and t AC bus 2. [Garble]. [Pause]
061:34:56 Schirra (onboard): Both buses reset almost immnediately. Prior to that time, we had lost - had had a caution and warning alarm and no indication of what caused it. Over.
061:35:20 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Understand just after crossing the Red Sea, you lost AC bus 1 and AC bus 2. You have obtained RESET. I am going to wait over Guam and go with this again. I am missing too much of the transmission. [Long pause]
061:35:38 Schirra: Roger. We're up here standing by. [Long pause]
061:36:20 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read?
061:36:22 Schirra: Roger. Loud and clear.
061:36:25 Pogue: Okay. I am sorry to have you repeat this again. But I did not get the full message there. I got something after passing the Red Sea. You had AC bus 1 and AC bus 2 fail. You did get RESET on both buses. Is that correct? [Long pause]
061:36:44 Schirra: That is correct, approximately 61 hours and 14 minutes. About 9 minutes earlier, we had a master alarm, but no caution and warning lights indicated. [Pause]
061:36:54 Pogue: You had no caution and warning lights. [Pause]
061:36:59 Schirra: That was 9 minutes earlier. If you recall, we had a bit of ghosts earlier in the mission. We also had an AC 1 bus failure when we lost a compressor twice, and it came back up again. Apparently, we've got a trend here that I'd like to have more information about. [Long pause]
061:37:20 Pogue: Roger. Understand. You think it is a ghost. Now - just to make sure I have it correct. You do have both AC buses working normally now. [Pause]
061:37:29 Schirra: That is correct. I am not sure kind - what kind of ghosts we have, but we have had master alarms and no indication as to the cause. [Pause]
061:37:38 Pogue: Thank you. [Pause]
061:37:43 Cunningham: Hey, Bill, We got one more thing that may or may not be significant, but after I reset the first master alarm with no caution or warning light, I checked the currents on all the fuel cells, and we were averaging a little over 20 amps per fuel cell, and now we are back to about 15. And, at first, I attributed that to a cycling load. I don't know; it could possibly have been AC loads. I don't know. [Long pause]
061:38:14 Pogue: Roger. Understand. Immediately after RESET, you monitored the fuel cell currents at 20.0 amps, and they are now reading 15.0. [Pause]
061:38:23 Cunningham: That is a negative. After the master alarm, with no caution or warning lights, at 61 09 is when I noticed the fuel cell currents. The other two caution and warning alarms when the bus failed were 61 14. Over. [Long pause]
061:38:43 Pogue: Roger.
061:38:46 Schirra: If we sound puzzled now, we were not then. [Pause]
061:38:54 Pogue: Roger. [Pause]
061:39:04 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. We are getting a tape dump here at Guam, and we will be taking a look at it and be trying to give you a call at Redstone on this. [Long pause]
061:39:15 Schirra: Okay. There is not much we can do right now, but I would like to find out what we have left if this continues. [Pause]
061:39:21 Pogue: Roger.
061:39:23 Schirra: All I know is that there is a lot [garble] coins in the water. [Pause]
061:39:27 Pogue: Understand.

061:41:31 Pogue: And - Apollo 7, Houston - I would like to confirm a canister change at around the 58-hour point. [Long pause]
061:41:43 Schirra: That's affirmative.
061:41:44 Pogue: Thank you.
Very long comm break.
061:57:09 Cunningham (onboard): At 61 hours and 57 minutes, it's noted that the cabin temperature indicator now shows 70 degrees, and the suit temperature scale is showing about 53 degrees. Immediately subsequent to powering down to get to flight configuration, it was noted that the suit temperature was like 55 degrees and the cabin temperature was about 75.
REDSTONE (REV 39)
062:01:25 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
062:01:29 Eisele: Roger, Houston. Go ahead.
062:01:31 Pogue: Roger. I was a bit optimistic. It'll take a little longer to look at those tapes, but we did get a dump over Guam, and we'll be giving you our analysis of the situation as soon as we get it. In the meantime, I'd like to go back over my notes and make sure that I have the story correct. Okay. The way I have it: at 61 plus 09, you got a master alarm light with no caution and warning lights? You reset the master alarm. Okay. [Long pause]
062:02:18 Pogue: At that time, fuel cell current was averaging 20.0 each. At 61 plus 14, you got ac AC 1 and an AC 2 fail. You reset both AC 1 and AC 2 successfully. At the time that you were talking to me, about 61 plus 30, the fuel cells were averaging 15 amps, one-five amps. That is the story as I have it copied. [Long pause]
062:03:09 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Did you read? [Pause]
062:03:15 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7. You read?
062:03:18 Pogue: Roger. Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read me? [Pause]
062:03:22 Eisele: Read you fine now. How me?
062:03:24 Pogue: I read you about four-by-four. Did you get I my transmission there? [Pause]
062:03:29 Eisele: Affirmative. The details are correct. The time was 61 plus 05 for the master alarm and 61 plus 14 for the bus fail. [Long pause]
062:03:40 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Copied the correction, 61 plus 05 for the master alarm. [Pause]
062:03:48 Eisele: And the fuel cell loading may or may not be significant. That was the third AC bus 1 failure we've had and the first AC bus 2 failure, and best onboara analysis is to track it down to a transient overvoltage, but guiding onto both buses, which seems kind of difficult. [Long pause]
062:04:11 Pogue: Roger.
062:04:14 Eisele: Did you read? [Long pause]
062:04:46 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7. Did you read?
062:04:47 Pogue: Roger. Go. [Pause]
062:04:51 Eisele: Did you read my last transmission, Bill?
062:04:53 Pogue: Roger. Understand. You have - this is the third AC 1 failure, the first AC 2 failure that you've experienced. You are doubtful - you are in question as to how a transient overvoltage can throw both AC's off line. Is that your question? [Long pause]
062:05:20 Eisele: That's affirmative.
062:05:22 Pogue: Okay. We're looking at it. We will be looking at that and trying to give you a complete story as soon as we can put it together. [Pause]
062:05:29 Eisele: Okay. And confirm we have a good tape running now. [Pause]
062:05:33 Pogue: Stand by. [Long pause]
062:05:53 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. We are rewinding the tape now. The tape will be yours at LOS. [Pause]
062:06:02 Eisele: Roger. Thank you.
062:06:05 Pogue: LOS in about 3 and 1/2 minutes.
Comm break.
062:09:05 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up on LOS Redstone; Ascension at 27. [Pause]
062:09:12 Eisele: Roger. We'll be standing by.
062:09:14 Pogue: And the tape recorder is yours now. [Pause]
062:09:18 Unidentifiable crewmember: Understand?
062:09:21 Schirra: Houston, this is Wally. Houston, this is Wally. [Pause]
062:09:27 Pogue: Go.
062:09:29 Schirra: Roger. You might just check into our configuration on the last minute variance on inverter safety wiring. [Pause]
062:09:39 Pogue: Roger. Check into the inverter safety wiring.
062:09:42 Schirra: There's a new change in the glitches that they had at the plant. [Pause]
062:09:49 Pogue: Roger.
062:09:52 Eisele: I think Wally's referring to the change where they disconnected the overload transit.

Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, 62 hours 42 minutes into the mission. As you heard, we're anticipating contact with tracking ship Mercury at 63:04. The tape was selfexplanatory and the master alarm light coming on and the procedures that were gone through, the reset was successful. The AC buss one and two fail, ah, of course the AC buss being distribution points for the alternating current to go to the various spacecraft circuitry. As of now, as you heard on the Ascension pass, Bill Pogue, here in the Control Center talked to the spacecraft. Everything appears normal, the current for the fuel cells at present is normal on the last readouts. Last word, the spacecraft Commander Wally Schirra and the LM Pilot Walt Cunningham were sacking out. At 62 hours 43 minutes this is Apollo Control.
This is Mission Control 63 hours 04 minutes into Apollo 7. We're coming up on the Mercury tracking ship for a pass. Let's join the conversation.
GUAM (REV 40)
063:10:50 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston.
063:10:53 Eisele: Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
063:10:55 Pogue: Roger. Acquisition Guam.
063:10:58 Eisele: Roger.
Long comm break.
063:14:33 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. About 1 minute 30 seconds LOS Guam. Redstone at 36, and we'd like to confirm BIOMED switch center. [Long pause]
063:14:47 Eisele: Roger. Stand by. Switch at center. [Pause]
063:14:57 Pogue: Roger. Understand. It is at center.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 63 hours, 16 minutes into the flight of Apollo 7. Our next acquisition point will be the Redstone tracking ship at 63:36. Like to give a little recap on a situation we had concerning the AC busses. At 62 hours and one minute into the flight, Astronaut Pogue in the Control Center requestioned Apollo 7 concerning a message that was hardly readable which had been received at 61:27 from Astronaut Schirra, spacecraft commander, concerning the caution and warning panel. Then at 62:01 as I say, Astronaut Pogue indicated that we had had a dump over Guam of data, we were analyzing it and again went through what had happened onboard. In the period of the 39th revolution at 61 hours and 05 minutes, the master alarm light had come on. There had been no caution and warning light previous to that. It was also indicated then that the master alarm was okay after reset. After that, at 61 hours, 14 minutes the AC buss one and AC buss two failed. They were reset successfully at 61 hours 30 minutes the fuel cells were averaging 15 ampheres. Before that time, they were averaging 20 amperes of flow. It was indicated by the spacecraft that this was the third AC buss one fail during the flight and the first AC buss two fail during the flight. The question from onboard came could it be transient overvoltage, that if it were why would it fail both busses. It was also indicated that from the 20 down to the 15 amp level in output could possibly be due to the power down of the spacecraft or cyclic loads. Astronaut Schirra then indicated in this pass that back at the Control Center that we should check the configuration, the inverter safety wiring. At that time, Astronaut Cunningham indicated that Schirra had reference to changes concerning overload sensors that they had gone over previously. Over Ascension at 62:27 in the 40th revolution, Cap Com Astronaut Bill Pogue, talked to the spacecraft at that time Commander Schirra indicated everything was normal, Pogue indicated that they had finished the playback and that it was under study concerning the AC buss one and two problem and at 62 hours 30 minutes Apollo 7 indicated that the command pilot Schirra and the LM Pilot Cunningham were now sacking out, which indicates that everything at that time, to them, appeared to be normal. After this pass, which was a very uneventful pass, we also assume that everything is normal onboard the spacecraft. At this time, from the Guam pass, we did not get any biomedical readouts again. That's a recurring situation, we're tracking that down. Until right toward the end of the pass, about the last 20 seconds of the pass. At 63 hours, 20 minutes into the mission; this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control; 63 hours, 36 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We are currently on a nightside pass. Approaching South America, we are coming within range of the Redstone Tracking Ship. We will standby for any possible conversation.

This is Apollo Control, 63 hours, 44 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We are winding up our fourtieth revolution about to enter on our fourty first revolution, go over South America and come up on the Canary Islands acquistion point at 07 that is 40 - correction - 6407. At this point, spacecraft commander and the LM pilot, Schirra and Cunningham have been some asleep for some hour, 1 hour and 15 minutes. Everything appears operating satisfactorily in the spacecraft. At 6345 this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control, 64 hours 07 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We are approaching Canary Islands. Canary just had acquisition, let's join the conversation.
CANARY (REV 41)
064:07:09 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Acquisition Canary. [Pause]
064:07:14 Eisele: Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
064:07:17 Pogue: Roger. Just for your information, we have about a 6 and 1/2 minute pass here, and then it's going to be about 1 hour before we pick you up, and that'll be ower the Redstone.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control 64 hours 13 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. Things continue quiet. The spacecraft has just lost acquisition with the Canary Islands. The next point of acquisition for communication will be at 65 hours and 10 minutes with the Redstone tracking ship. We have nothing coming up in the flight plan until some 65 hours and 40 minutes where we have at this time a planned Control Center flight plan update which would be passed to the crew of the spacecraft. So, with a long dry spell coming up, this is Apollo Control, 64 hours 14 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7.
This is Apollo Control 65 hours 10 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We are coming up into acquisition with the Redstone tracking ship in a very few seconds. The last communication we had was some - almost an hour ago. We'll stand by and see what transpires in this pass.

065:14:06 Eisele: Read you five-by, Bill.
065:14:08 Pogue: Okay. Good. I wanted confirmation because I'm going to read off a fairly lengthy procedure. We have a procedure developed here to assist in locating the AC bus problem. [Long pause]
065:14:25 Eisele: Okay. Fine. Stand by, and I'll get something to write it down on. [Pause]
065:14:32 Eisele: Go ahead with your procedure.
065:14:33 Pogue: Okay. You can probably do it as I call it out. First, which AC bus is powering the following: cabin fan? [Long pause]
065:14:51 Eisele: Roger. Cabin fans are OFF.
065:14:54 Pogue: Roger. Cabin fans are OFF. Next, glycol pump. [Pause]
065:15:04 Eisele: Stand by. Glycol pump on AC1. [Pause]
065:15:09 Pogue: Roger. Glycol pump on AC1. Next, suit compressors. [Pause]
065:15:17 Eisele: Suit compressors on AC1. [Pause]
065:15:22 Pogue: Roger. AC1. Do not change configuration. [Pause]
065:15:32 Eisele: Roger.
065:15:33 Pogue: Okay. Number two. We would like for you to check the six CRYO fan circuit breakers on panel 226 and report if any are popped, but do not push them in. [Long pause]
065:15:50 Eisele: Stand by. [Long pause]

065:18:57 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. We would like you to switch omni for maximum signal strength. We'd like to get some TM before we have LOS here at Redstone, which is going to occur in about 45 seconds.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 65 hours, 20 minutes into the Apollo 7. During this pass at the Redstone tracking ship we passed up infornation to Donn Eisele trying to isolate the AC, the alternating current, buss problem that occurred before. We heard procedures where our Astronaut Pogue here in the Control Center was asking if the cabin fans were OFF, Eisele said yes, glycol pump and Eisele indicated it was on the AC1 buss or distributing point for the AC power, suit compressors also Eisele said were on AC1 buss. He was then instructed not to change the configuration, leave it the way it was. Pogue then indicated that he would like to know if the six cryo fan circuit breakers could be checked and if any were popped, that is out, of the circuit. The reply from Eisele was "No, they were all in" and that ended the pass except for Pogue to request him to switch the omni antennas so we could get a maximum signal strength. The next pass we will have will be at Antigua, which will be coning up at 30 minutes, ah, 65 hours, 30 minutes, 9 minutes from now. At 65:21 this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control, 65 hours, 30 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We'are coming up in a few seconds in a pass over Antigua. Let's standby for conversation of that flight.

065:41:19 Eisele: Let's proceed with the update, Bill.
065:41:21 Pogue: Roger. At 66 plus 15, delete the radar transponder selftest. [Long pause]
065:41:35 Eisele: Roger. Understand. Delete the test at 66 plus 15. [Pause]
065:41:39 Pogue: Roger. At 69 00, add unstow and set up TV camera. [Long pause]
065:41:59 Eisele: Roger. Understand. Set up the TV.

065:42:35 Eisele: Roger. Fuel cell O2 purge at 70 hours.
065:42:38 Pogue: Roger. And that is 71 plus 41, TV ON. [Long pause]
065:42:51 Eisele: Roger. You want the TV ON at the same tine when we're doing the rendezvous radar test. Is that correct ? [Pause]
065:42:59 Pogue: No, I think the rendezvous radar test is - stand by one. You're right. Wait just a minute. Let me get this cleared up. [Long pause]
065:43:13 Eisele: Okay.
065:43:14 Pogue: Meantime, would you switch omni, please?
065:43:17 Eisele: Roger. [Long pause]
065:43:28 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Would you confirm opposite omni? We are having a little trouble with TM. [Pause]
065:43:34 Eisele: Roger. I went from C to A. I'll try Bravo. [Pause]
065:43:38 Pogue: Roger. And that is the correct tine for TV ON. [Pause]
065:43:46 Eisele: Roger. TV ON at 41 plus 41. Is that right? [Pause]
065:43:50 Pogue: Affirmative. [Pause]
065:44:00 Pogue: That is the end of the flight plan update.
065:44:03 Eisele: Roger. If you don't want the TV on until 71 hours and 40 minutes, I think we will hold off unstowing it. The thing is in the way when it is up, and we would rather not be running into it all the time. [Long pause]
065:44:20 Pogue: I didn't hear it.
065:44:22 Eisele: Understand you want the TV running at the same time we're doing the - or will be doing the radar test. [Pause]
065:44:30 Pogue: That's affirmative. That's the confirmation I get here. [Pause]
065:44:35 Eisele: Okay. [Pause]
065:44:42 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni, please. [Pause]
065:44:47 Eisele: Roger. [Long pause]
065:45:05 Pogue: And - Apollo 7, Houston - for your information, I am pretty sure this TV ON time is tied into the Texas acquisition time. [Long pause]
065:45:16 Eisele: Yes, that figures. [Long pause]
065:45:34 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Would you confirm or report the position of your PMP power switch? [Pause]
065:45:43 Eisele: Stand by. [Pause]
065:45:47 Eisele: PMP is in NORMAL; it's UP.

This is Apollo Control; 65 hours, 50 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. In this last pass over Canary Islands, we had a flight plan update that consisted of deleting the radar - tests at 6 hours, 15 minutes. At 69 hours, adding an unstow and setting up of the TV camera onboard the spacecraft. At 69 hours, 50 minutes, they have deleted the reference to the H2 heaters on. At 70 hours, they added fuel cell oxygen purge. And the big one at 7141 into the mission - the schedule for the TV ON. The signal would be received at Corpus Christi, Texas. It would go through the conversion process, and then be released. Eisele asked at that point - indicated that it seemed to him that it was the same time as the rendezvous radar tests. CAPCOM indicated "Yes, you're right, and to standby." And then he came back and said, "That is the correct time, 71 hours, 41 minutes into the mission." Eisele indicated that they would like to hold off in unstowing the TV, if possible because it is in the way when they are moving around inside the spacecraft. CAPCOM Pogue at that point, indicated that as long as the time of 71 hours, 41 minutes into the mission was met for TV ON, they could do as they wished. It was also indicated that the time for TV ON, coincides with the Texas acquisition coming over the United States. At 65 hours, 52 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 66 hours 18 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We're coming up now over Carnarvon, Australia. We should have acquisition in some 25 seconds from now. On our 42nd revolution, let's stand by for conversation.

067:53:47 Pogue: Readback is correct. Donn, I have an analysis to this AC problem. I'll go over it and see what you have - what your comments are. [Long pause]
067:54:03 Eisele: Okay. Go ahead.
067:54:06 Pogue: Okay. Point 1, we have spent considerable time going through the data here. And we have noticed that the AC bus glitches are associated with the cycling OFF of O2 CRYO fans. This is causing the AC bus to surge to overvoltage. It seems as though this is only a problem at low power loads on the AC bus, but it has been noticed repeatedly. [Long pause]
067:54:51 Eisele: Okay. That - sounds pretty logical. [Pause]
067:54:55 Pogue: Point 2; recommendation O2 fans tank 1 OFF, do that. This will insure AC 1 stays on line. If our analysis of the problem is correct. [Long pause]
067:55:20 Eisele: Roger. What about AC 2. We have that one, also.
067:55:23 Pogue: Roger. You'll have that one ON. We will periodically switch O2 fans tank 1 back to the ON position. At the same time, O2 fans tank 2, OFF. This will insure at least one AC bus is protected at all times from this surging to overvoltage. [Long pause]
067:55:49 Eisele: Roger. I see. If we get fired up again, do you think we will still have this problem? [Pause]
067:55:55 Pogue: I'm not sure. It seems as though it is not nearly as much a problem when you're powered up, it is only when you're in a low power condition. The voltage control is more sensitive tends to overshoot or something there. [Long pause]
067:56:14 Eisele: Okay. I'll turn tank 1 off for now.
067:56:17 Pogue: Roger. Understand. [Pause]
067:56:26 Eisele: We're probably going to get some stratification when we've proved out on this stratification test. [Pause]
067:56:33 Pogue: Roger. We have taken that into consideration. [Pause]

This is Apollo Control 68 hours 8 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. During this pass we heard Astronaut Pogue, our Cap Com here at MCC, update the command module computer on the program P-27 it's called. He updated for the rendezvous radar test and also indicated that the AC buss problem we had reached a tentative conclusion here in the Control Center and that was that the glitsch is associated with the cycle of the OFF position of both of the O2 cryogenic fans, that's the cryogenic oxygen fans, causes surging of the AC alternating current busses or distribution points to overvoltage conditions. That's a problem, it seems, at low loads on the AC busses. The proposed solution was indicated to be that the O2 fans for tank number two should be ON, the O2 fans for tank number one should be OFF. If the above solution works out, if its correct, then the AC one buss would stay on the line. Periodically they propose to switch the O2 fans in tank number one to ON and the O2 fans on tank number two to OFF at that time thereby keeping one ON and one OFF at all times to test out this solution. In that way, one AC buss would be protected at all times from that overvoltage condition. This was acknowledged by Donn Eisele in the spacecraft and this is the solution that they are now testing out. We anticipate a pass over the United States, will be in acquisition Texas at 68 hours 34 minutes. At 68 hours 10 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 68 hours 34 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. Spacecraft is approaching America. It will be over Texas very shortly at which time we should have some updates for the crew. Let's join the conversation.

068:36:23 Eisele: Go.
068:36:24 Swigert: Donn, I've got your block data number 8 for you. Also, could you switch the BIOMED switch tO CDR, and could you confirm that you have turned the CRYO fans tank 1 OFF? [Long pause]
068:36:42 Eisele: Roger. CRYO fan tank 1 is OFF, and Wally's still asleep, but he doesn't have his BIOMED hooked up. [Pause]
068:36:51 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
068:36:53 Eisele: Will get it on him when they get up.
068:36:55 Swigert: Okay. Re al fine.

068:57:36 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. You're about 30 seconds LOS Canary. You sure look good going over the hill. We'll pick you up at Carnarvon in about 28 minutes.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 68 hours, 57 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. CapCom has indicated the spacecraft looks good going over the hill, and they will be picked up at Carnarvon at 69 hours, 25 minutes. We will have a not too brief, I'm afraid, rundown on the last 8 hours of operation in the Control Center here. Beginning at 61 hours, 27 minutes over tracking ship Mercury and revolution 39, Apollo 7 reported caution and warning panel problems. Their communication was hard to read. On the next station, the Redstone tracking ship at 62 hours, 1 minute in the same revolution, CapCom Pogue contacted the crew and indicated that the data was dUmped over Guam and it was being analyzed here at the Control Center. A review of caution and warning panel problems followed and that review indicated that at 61 hours and 5 minutes, the master alarm light went on. At this time, the fuel cells were indicating over 20 amps or amperes flow for each one, average. There was no caution and warning light preceeding the master alarm light going on. They reset the master alarm satisfactorily and at 61 hours, 14 minutes, AC bus 1 and AC bus 2 failure occurred. Alternating current through the AC busses is a distributing point for the AC current to go to the several systems of the spacecraft to utilize such current. After that failure, they reset AC bus 1 and AC bus 2 satisfactorily, then at 61 hours, 30 minutes, they noted that the fuel cells averaged 15 amps each. Astronaut Schirra indicated this is the third AC bus 1 failure and the first AC bus 2 failure. If it was due to transient over voltage, the question was why would both busses fail. The decrease in amps - amperage from 20 to 15 amps average could be due, it was indicated to the spacecraft power down or a cyclic loads. He suggested that they - down at the Control Center here - check the configuration and the inverter safety wiring, at which point Astronaut Walt Cunningham, the LMP chimed in and indicated that he felt astronaut Schirra was referring to changes in the overload sensors. Over Ascension at 62 hours, 27 minutes in the 40th revolution, CapCom Pogue again contacted the spacecraft. Schirra indicated that everything was normal. Pogue indicated that they had finished the playback of the AC bus trouble and it was currently being'studied here by the Control Center. Apollo 7 then indicated that the CDR, Schirra, and the LMP, Cunningham were sacking out now. Over the Redstone tracking ship, it's 63 hours, 38 minutes in the 40th revolution. Pogue contacted the spacecraft and asked the question was the Command Module computer power up over Guam. Eisele indicated yes, it was for a short while, then it was switched off. Pogue indicated that the procedure at 65 hours, 14 minutes over the Redstone again, revolution 41, for isolating the AC bus problem. Pogue asked what position the cabin fan control in, Eisele indicated off. We asked the glycol pump position, Eisele indicated on AC bus 1 the suit compressor position which was on AC bus 1. Pogue then indicated that astronaut Eisele should not change that configuration, also indicated that he should check the cryogenic fan circuit breakers, if any were popped out and if they were, not to push them. The reply from the Spacecraft was all of them were in. Over Antigua, at 65 hours, 35 minutes and revolution 42, CapCom Pogue gave the crew a flight plan update and that indicated that at 66 hours, 15 minutes they would delete the radar transponder self test. At 69 hours, they would add into the flight plan unstow and set up the TV camera. At 69 hours, 50 minutes to delete reference to the H2 heaters ON. At 70 hours, to add fuel O2 purge. At 71 hours, 41 minutes to incicate TV on. That would be 9:44 central daylight time. Eisele asked the question at that time, would the TV be scheduled to be on at the same time as the rendezvous radar test, over the stateside pass? Pogue replied, you're right, standby. Then he checked and came back to the crew, to Eisele with the information that that was the correct time. Eisele said, if the TV is not on until 71 hours, 40 minutes, he felt they would hold off installing the TV from the scheduled time of 69 hours, since it would be in the way of the crew members moving around in the spacecraft. Pogue indicated 71:41 is the correct time for TV on. And TV on coincides with the Texas acquisition. At Redstone again, 66 hours, 46 minutes, revolution 42, some telemetry problems were encountered. They received no telemetry here at the Control Center during that pass from the PM, pulse modulation, USB. Then over Antigua at 67 hours, 4 minutes, revolution 43, they are still working on the TM problem, they still had no PM and over the Canary Islands at 67 hours, 15 minutes on the same revolution, the same condition existed; however, they could receive and still can receive TM on the FM band of the USB, as a backup mode. There are two ideal prime modes on USB, pulse modulation, PM, is for the telemetry, and also for the TV system; and FM, frequency modulation, is for dumps of information and real-time data. When - since the PM portion is out, that cuts out 50 percent of the capability of the USB, which simply means that the TM and the TV would have to alternate with dumps and real-time data, using the FM system as a backup mode. Over Canary Islands at 67 hours, 15 minutes, revolution 43 CapCom Pogue indicated that the inertial measuring unit should go to IDLE or PU as it is referred to at Carnarvon, and there is still no PM at that time, so they're still using the FM backup mode for telemetry and data dumps. Over Carnarvon at 67 hours, 50 minutes, revolution 43 CapCom Pogue talked to the spacecraft again, and updated the spacecraft with a program 27, Command Module computer update, rendezvous radar test update and talked about the AC bus problem, which we have encountered. The conclusion from the Control Center here was that the glitches associated with the cycle of OFF position of both of the oxygen cryogenic fans, caused a surging of the AC busses or distribution points, to overVOltage conditions. It seems to be a problem at low loads on the AC busses not at high loads. So the proposed solution was sent up to the spacecraft thatthe O2 fans on tank number 2 be turned ON and at the same time the O2 fans on tank number 1 be in the OFF position. And if solution is correct, the AC busses would stay on the line. Then they would propose to periodically switch the O2 fans, tank number 1 to ON, and the O2 fans, tank number 2, to OFF. In this way, one AC buss would be protected at all times from overvoltage conditions. On the Texas pass we just had, at 68 hours 34 minutes, revolution 43, CAPCOM Pogue again contacted the spacecraft and asked for a confirmation of the O2 fans on tank number 2 were ON and the O2 fans on tank number 1 were OFF. Astronaut Eisele gave him that confirmation and indicated that Schirra was still asleep. At that time, Astronaut Pogue relayed from Flight Director Jerry Griffin that they had a GO for 62 dash 1, which means that they have a GO condition for 61 orbits. We are presently crossing Africa, we will come up on Carnarvon at 69:25 into the mission. The commander and LM pilot, Schirra and Cunningham, should be awake at this time. They will all go into an eat period and we will start a new day at 69 hours 10 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 69 hours, 26 minutes into the flight. And through Carnarvon this morning Jack Swigert just established contact with a rather sleepy sounding Walt Cunningham. Here is how that conversation is going.
CARNARVON (REV 44)
069:25:40 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
069:25:43 Cunningham: Roger, Houston. Good morning, Jack.
069:25:45 Swigert: Good morntng, Walt. How are you this morning?
069:25:48 Cunningham: Fine. [Pause]
069:25:52 Swigert: We'll be standing by. [Long pause]
069:26:06 Cunningham: Hey, Jack. I have a question on our low quad. We had one quad yesterday that was reading 47 percent. Are we going to want that quad propellant pressure around the 43-percent level, or are we going to switch to secondary propellants open loop at 43? Over. [Long pause]
069:26:26 Swigert: Okay. Stand by. I'll get G&C on that here.
Comm break.
069:27:55 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
069:27:59 Cunningham: GO ahead, Houston.
069:28:01 Swigert: Walt, you are about 25 pounds away from the point at which you should switch, which is about 6 percent; so you are quite a ways away, so there is no need to hurry on that now, and we'll give you, when you start getting close, a gage reading of which you should switch. [Long pause]
069:28:20 Cunningham: Roger. And will we switch quad by quad?
069:28:23 Swigert: Affirmative. Quad by Quad.
069:28:26 Cunningham: Okay. We need a map update, please. [Pause]
069:28:30 Swigert: Say again. Oh, a map update? Stand by.
Comm break.
069:29:35 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We'll be talking to you. We'll pick up Honeysuckle in about 4 minutes. We'd like you to turn up your S-band. [Pause]

069:36:12 Cunningham: Roger. This is Apollo 7. Can you read?
069:36:15 Swigert: I read you five-by now. We need to switch the BIOMED switch to CDR. [Pause]
069:36:22 Cunningham: Roger. Won't do any good; he's not plugged up.
069:36:25 Swigert: Okay. When he gets plugged up, would you do it? [Pause]
069:36:32 Cunningham: Okay. I get a high-pitched squeal on S-band. How about you? [Pause]
069:36:38 Swigert: Roger. Walt, we've commanded backup voice there because we've lost the PM, and we're going on FM now. We got the voice on the FM subcarrier. [Long pause]
069:36:50 Eisele: Okay. What's the status ou our tape recorder? [Pause]

069:38:12 Swigert: Roger. Walt, when you want to use the tape recorder, go to low bit rate and RECORD. When you are ready - when you are through recording and want us to dump it, let us know, and we will interrupt real-time data and dump it. [Long pause]
069:38:32 Cunningham: Is this a change for our normal operating procedures for the flight? [Long pause]
069:38:43 Cunningham: I am not reading you any more.
069:38:45 Swigert: Okay. Walt, what we have lest is the PM downlink. We are on the PM downlink now, which means we are time-sharing DSE with real-time downlink. [Long pause]
069:39:01 Cunningham: Roger. Have we lost that permanently? [Pause]
069:39:06 Swigert: It hasn't been determined yet. We are going to do a little bit of checking here. [Pause]
069:39:13 Cunningham: Okay. Well, I'll take the tape recorder back and - on 69 hours and 39 minutes. [Pause]
069:39:21 Swigert: 0kay.
069:39:24 Cunningham: You are going to still keep the bookkeeping on it?
069:39:27 Swigert: Okay.

Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control Houston. We have finally lost contact via Carnarvon station. We are 69 hours 42 minutes in the flight. The weatherman has sent us his happy report this morning and it goes like this. In the western Atlantic areas, the weather will be partly cloudy, winds will be easterly 10 to 15 knots, seas about 4 feet, temperatures in the high 70's. In the east Atlantic, mostly clear to partly cloudy skies, easterly winds 12 to 15 knots, seas 4 feet, temperature in the mid-70's. In,the western Pacific areas where Apollo might land if it had to, easterly winds 12 to 15 knots, seas 4 to 5 feet, and the temperature is ranging from' the low 70's in the north to the low 80's in the southernmost landing areas. In the northern part of mid-Pacific landing zone, weather is mostly cloudy with'scattered showers, winds are easterly 15 to 18 knots and with seas an average of 6 feet. The temperatures are in the mid-70's and the southern parts of the same zones the weather is partly cloudy with southerly winds of 15 knots and 5 foot seas. The spacecraft crew will perhaps have the opportunity to see a tropical developing in the Carribean today, that is out in the area of the Windward Islands. At 69 hours and 44 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control Houston.

070:05:28 Cunningham: Apollo 7. Reading five-by-five.
070:05:30 Swigert: Roger. Five-by. Walt, we want to delete these COMM tests that we were going to do over this stateside pass here or over Canaries. [Long pause]
070:05:42 Cunningham: Roger. Understand. [Long pause]
070:06:07 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7.
Apollo Control Houston here 70 hours 6 minutes into the flight and we are talking to the crew through Guaymas. Here's how it is going." [Long pause]
070:06:23 Cunningham: Hello, Houston, Apollo 7.
070:06:25 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
070:06:27 Schirra: Roger. We have a computer problem. We are unable to get a MARK in [garble]. [Long pause]
070:06:43 Schirra: And as a result of this, we are not aligned at this point and possibly will not be able to support the WSMR test. [Long pause]
070:06:55 Swigert: If I copy you, Wally, understand you have had a problem in aligning the platform, and you may not be able to support the WSMR test. Is that Charlie? [Pause]
070:07:04 Schirra: That is Charlie. The problem apparently is the MARK button. [Pause]
070:07:10 Swigert: A problem with the MARK button. Roger. Understand. [Pause]
070:07:14 Schirra: Yes, we hope that's what it is, Jack. It was attempted in the P51, and in step 4, we have a flashing 51 and calling for a MARK. We pushed the MARK button repeatedly, and it will not go on to the next display. Apparently, it's not accepting the MARK, or else the MARK button is filled; I'm not sure which. I did check - I did check a bit in flagwood 74, the L53 flag, and that was set when the 51 was flashing. I also did a CNC self-check that turned out okay; and we did a halting 53 - by that I mean we just ran through the program without actually maneuvering. It seemed to work fine. We did punch the ENTER button, and the computer progressed through the program. [Long pause]
070:08:00 Swigert: okay. Roger, Apollo 7. Looks like we're reading your DSKY now. You're still on Program 41 with NOUN 70? [Pause]
070:08:09 Cunningham: Negative. We've got P00 in there right now. Do you want me to call it back up?
070:08:12 Swigert: Okay. Yes, I guess we missed a lockon data. [Pause]
070:08:17 Cunningham: Okay. [Long pause]
070:08:46 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7. On our pre-mod processor here, we had a failed normal pre-mod processor [garble]. [Long pause]
070:09:01 Swigert: Roger. Understand. Copy that you had a failed pre-mod processor, and you're going to run the rest of the flight in AUXILIARY. [Pause]
070:09:09 Cunningham: That's negative! We are operating in AUXILIARY now per your request duaring the evening; and I'm trying to find out - are we going to have to operate there the rest of the flight? [Long pause]
070:09:22 Swigert: Walt, we're working on a troubleshooting procedure on this. I'm sorry I missed part of your transmission. [Pause]
070:09:32 Swigert: We'll be troubleshooting this, and we will get you a reading on it shortly. [Pause]
070:09:37 Cunningham: Hey, Jack. When I got up this morning, we had already been told by ground to go to PMP AUXILIARY earlier in the evening, and I'm wondering is there trouble with the NORMAL; and if not, we'd like to get back so we can operate the tape recorder the way we started. [Long pause]
070:10:15 Swigert: Just a minute, Walt.
Comm break.
070:12:01 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
070:12:03 Cunningham: Go, Houston.
070:12:05 Swigert: Roger. Walt, we had a problem last night with the NORMAL PM where we lost voice telemetry subcarrier of the NORMAL PM, and we're devising a troubleshooting procedure now. We'd like for you to stay in this present configuration until we've gotten that procedure up to you. You can use the tape recorder as you want as long as you are in low bit rate. [Long pause]
GUAYMAS through ANTIGUA (REV 45)
070:12:32 Cunningham: Okay. I picked up the tape recorder when it was already played out. I rewound it; it's standing by for a dump now in case he has something on it. Do you want a dump? [Long pause]
070:12:50 Swigert: Walt, did you have very much of a voice transcription on that tape recorder? [Pause]
070:12:55 Cunningham: I don't know, but the whole tape has been recorded so it's going to take you about 8 minutes for a complete dump. [Pause]
070:13:05 Swigert: Okay. Stand by.
Comm break.
070:14:27 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
070:14:30 Unidentifiable crewmember: Roger. Go.
070:14:31 Swigert: On the tape recorder, there's nothing there that we feel we'd like to dump it for, anless you have made some voice transmissions in there that we don't know about. [Long pause]
070:14:46 Unidentifiable crewmember: The only thing we might lose that I can think of would be some of the film log? and I think we can cover that another way. [Pause]
070:14:54 Swigert: Okay. We won't dump it then. [Pause]
070:14:58 Unidentifiable crewmember: Okay. We'll go ahead and only data run when we want to record something. That way we will limit the amount of time required for dumping. [Pause]

070:25:44 Eisele: Roger. Say again, Jack?
070:25:46 Swigert: We have something we would like you to do to verify the operation of the MARK button. While in program 00, we would like to have you press the MARK button and verify whether you get a PROGRAM ALARM. [Long pause]
070:26:04 Eisele: Okay. Here goes. I do not get a PROGRAM ALARM. [Pause]
070:26:11 Swigert: Okay. If you don't get a PROGRAM AIAEM now, press the MARK REJECT button while in P00 there and see whether you get a PROGRAM ALARM. [Pause]
070:26:21 Eisele: Roger. Pressing MARK REJECT, I get no PROGRAM ALARM.
070:26:24 Swigert: Roger. Copy that. During this next night pass, we would like you to try P51 again. If you don't get any response from the MARK button, then try P53 and P54. [Long pause]
070:26:50 Schirra: Jack, do you have any [garble]. [Pause]
070:27:00 Swigert: Roger. Copy. Stand by.
070:27:02 Schirra: Roger. We used quite a bit of fuel on 53. We'd like to have an update on our fuel status. This is the reason I'm concerned about it, and I sure do [garble] TV [garble] problem. [Long pause]
070:27:30 Swigert: Okay. Wally, stand by. We are going to discuss that here. [Pause]
070:27:35 Schirra: Okay. Realize that if we do 53 [garble] and use the COAS for burns. [Pause]
070:27:40 Swigert: Roger. We understand.
070:27:42 Schirra: Pretty busy getting set up here. Guess you want to watch our close up [garble] on the TV. [Pause]
070:27:50 Swigert: Okay. We will discuss that, Wally. We will be back to you. In the meantime, Walt, we would like to have you read off the positions of your S-band NORMAL and S-band AUX switches here so we could start the troubleshooting procedure on this PM. [Long pause]
070:28:08 Cunningham: S-band NORMAL switches are in VOICE, POM, and RANGING; S-baud AUX is still in TAPE; and I guess I may as well turn the tape switch off. I still have power switches SCE NORMAL, PMP on OFF. Over. [Long pause]
070:28:28 Swigert: Roger. We copy. [Pause]
070:28:33 Swigert: What are the position of your transponders, Walt?
070:28:36 Cunningham: I'm in SENCONDARY of the transponder and the power amplifier in HIGH. [Pause]
070:28:42 Swigert: Okay. Copy. We'll be back... [Pause]
070:28:46 Cunningham: Hey, Jack...
070:28:47 Swigert: Go ahead.
070:28:48 Cunningham: [Garble] tape now; why don't I turn the [garble] tape switch off. [Long pause]
070:28:59 Swigert: We'd rather have you just leave it on, Walt.
070:29:02 Cunningham: Okay.
Comm break.
CANARY (REV 45)
070:30:27 Stafford: Hello, Apollo 7, Houston.
070:30:30 Unidentifiable crewmember: Roger, Houston. Go.
070:30:32 Stafford: Okay. If we can't get through the P51 and 52 using the MARK button, go ahead and use the COAS and get 53 and 54 for the IMU alignment. [Long pause]
070:30:44 Schirra: Roger. Tom, my concern is, are you willing to expend the service module RCS fuel for the radar transponder test, or are you asking me to be willing to? [Long pause]
070:30:56 Stafford: Well, the whole thfng, Wally - we want to get the platform aligned first and see what we've got. We'll talk about the rest of it down the line over Carnarvon. [Long pause]
070:31:08 Schirra: I think we've got a problem, and I go along with getting the IMU alignment, too. [Pause]
070:31:12 Stafford: We'll try the COAS one time. It's worth it one time in case that we can't get the optics going. [Pause]
070:31:20 Schirra: Okay.
070:31:21 Stafford: All right.
070:31:22 Cunningham: Will you give us a total number of pounds of propellants remaining? I can put it in my [garble]. [Pause]
070:31:28 Stafford: Yes. Okay, Walt. We're going to give you this over Carnarvon. [Pause]
070:31:32 Cunningham: Standing by.
070:31:33 Stafford: Roger. [Long pause]
070:32:05 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston. Your total usable RCS fuel now is 750 pounds. [Pause]
070:32:14 Cunningham: That is 750 pounds; goes on my chart at 70 hours into the flight. I want total number of fuel because I think, on my chart here, the unusable is already taken off the bottom. [Long pause]
070:32:30 Stafford: Okay. The 750 is usable. [Pause]
070:32:35 Cunningham: Well, would you take a look at your copy of my onboard chart and give me a number that I can stick on that? [Pause]
070:32:43 Stafford: Okay. Walt, we'll pass that over to you over Tananarive. We're about to lose you here. Tananarive at 13 minutes. [Pause]
070:32:50 Cunningham: Okay. Thank you.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 70 hours, 33 minutes into the flight. And we have lost contact by the Canary Station, and we will pick up again at Tananarive and conclude that conversation about onboard usable. The precise gaging here, other affects are being figured in here; you heard the flight director tell the CAPCOM to give him 750 pounds which number was passed up. Now in addition to that there is a gaging factor, certain other allowances and the precise overage estimate is also being calculated now. In the course of that ON, you heard a trouble shooting procedure real time wherein Don Eisele was asked to push the MARK button on some of his equipment related to the guidance and navigation system. This gear is down in the lower equipment bay and the MARK button effectively has the capability of putting into the computer certain angles and other mathematical information about a given star when it's properly sighted through the GNN optics. In other words, the pilots look at a star when they are satisfied they have the right star in the window, they press the MARK button and the information regarding angle and such is automatically transferred to the computer. This function apparently is not taking place. The second step in the trouble shooting procedure was to hit the MARK REJECT button, both of which should have produced a warning buzzer, but apparently neither worked. Other devices can be used of course to get this information. The cabin temp this morning is 69 degrees. And at 70 hours and 35 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
Apollo Control, Houston here at 70 hours, 46 minutes into the flight. We are in touch with Apollo 7 through Tananarive and here's how that's going.
TANANARIVE (REV 45)
070:45:29 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
070:45:36 Cunningham: Go ahead, Houston.
070:45:37 Stafford: Roger. Walt, the reading that you should be having on your chart for RCS fuel is 808 pounds. [Long pause]
070:45:49 Cunningham: Roger. 808, 58 plus the 750 you gave me. [Pause]
070:45:54 Stafford: Roger.
070:45:56 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston.
070:45:58 Cunningham: Go ahead, Tom.
070:46:00 Stafford: Okay. I want to cheek how this alignment is going out. We've already worked out with Steve Cops here a real slick little way of doing 53 and 54 using those optics down below that should cost us very little fuel. And be about as accurate as 51 and 52.
070:46:XX Eisele: Very good. We've done an alinement. Let me readout to you.
070:46:XX Stafford: Okay, Donn, have you got your book out for P53?
070:46:XX Eisele: Standby one.
070:4X:XX Eisele: Okay Go.
070:4X:XX Stafford: Okay, on P53 you'll enter 53 in step 1 and step 2. When you acquire the two stars we will use the sextant and telescope down below, and when you get it in the sextant you will note the shaft and trunion angles that you have there. You will have to call Verb 16, Noun 91. Go back and enter above as Verb 06 Noun 92 in step 3. You can proceed and then you'll hold attitude at ENTER. If the attitude hold is brought on it should be about as accurate as we had before. Over.
070:4X:XX Eisele: Okay (garbled)
070:4X:XX Stafford: Okay
070:4X:XX Eisele: Roger Tom. How much more time this pass?
070:4X:XX Stafford: We've got about 2 more minutes.
070:47:54 Schirra: Okay. Do to you want go through and read that one again? [Pause]
070:47:59 Stafford: We've got 4 minutes. Do you want me to read it ovex? [Pause]
070:48:07 Schirra: Do you read, Tom? [Pause]
070:48:12 Stafford: Apollo 7, say again.
070:48:15 Eisele: Yes. Tom, will you go through that again a little bit slower? I was a little bit behind in copying down the procedures, I'm ready to go again. [Pause]
070:48:22 Stafford: Okay. We go through step 1 and and 2 of P53, and you can use the coarse align option if you want to, but we acquire the stars within the telescope. [Long pause]
070:48:38 Eisele: Roger.
070:48:39 Stafford: Okay. Once we get the NAV star in the telescope, then go ahead and get it into the sextant. [Pause]
070:48:45 Eisele: Okay. I see, then we [garble].
070:48:48 Stafford: Okay. When you get it into the sextant, then you can hit VERB 16 NOUN 91 to read the shaft and trunion of that star. [Pause]
070:48:58 Eisele: Roger.
070:48:59 Stafford: Okay. With that value, you go back in step 3 - you see flahing VERB 06 N0UN 92? - you can enter NOUN 92, which is the value you have read out. [Pause]
070:49:09 Eisele: Roger.
070:49:10 Stafford: Then proceed.
070:49:12 Eisele: Okay.
070:49:13 Stafford: Then you can use the ENTER button for your MARK.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control Houston at 70 hours 52 minutes into the flight through Tananarive through which we lost contact. About a minute ago you heard Tom Stafford give Apollo 7 an alternate way of getting the shaft and trunion, the two angles required to do a navigational plotting on a star - he gave them an alternate way to get that information into the onboard computer. Earlier we had established that the MARK button, or the MARK device through which that information is normally inserted into the computer is - we established that it is inoperative. We are now going through the data insertion keyboard, which on checking we discover is another way to put that information in. At 70 hours 53 minutes into the flight this is Apollo Control in Houston.
CARNARVON (REV 45)
071:00:45 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
071:00:51 Schirra: Go ahead, Houston.
071:00:53 Stafford: Roger, Apollo 7. How is the alignment coming? [Pause]
071:00:57 Schirra: We are styli star reading right now. [Pause]
071:01:03 Stafford: Okay. Understand you are still in progrmn 53. [Pause]
071:01:10 Schirra: We are just trying to acquire a star at this point, Tom.
071:01:13 Stafford: Okay. [Long pause]
071:01:40 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston. I'll go ahead and brief you on vhat we've got planned. [Long pause]
071:01:51 Schirra: Wait. Let's wait, Tom, until we get done with this alignment. [Pause]
071:01:58 Stafford: Yes, yes, okay. I'll just stand by here. [Pause]
071:02:04 Schirra: Okay. I would like to get this other one started.
071:02:07 Stafford: All right. [Long pause]
071:02:18 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7. [Pause]
071:02:22 Stafford: Go ahead, Wally.
Long comm break.
071:05:24 Schirra: Okay. Donn is busy right now. You got a message for him or could I take it? [Pause]
071:05:30 Stafford: That was too fast. Say again. [Pause]
071:05:34 Schirra: Donn is in the MARK routine right now. Is the message for him, or could I take it? [Pause]
071:05:44 Stafford: No, it's for the whole crew, and the main thing is to get the platform aligned. And, Wally, if you would turn up the S-band at 71:08:45, we will talk to you through Honeysuckle. [Long pause]
071:05:58 Schirra: Very good. We did need the arm to curve on this TV cemera; we will try to get it up for you. [Pause]
071:06:05 Stafford: Okay. We want to see how the platform alignment comes out, and we will talk to you over Honeysuckle. [Pause]
071:06:11 Schirra: Okay. I'm not going to rush into anything else but that.
071:06:14 Stafford: Okay. [Long pause]
071:07:03 Stafford: Aplllo 7, Houston. [Pause]
071:07:07 Eisele: Roger. Loud and clear.
071:07:09 Stafford: Okay. Right now, when Donn is reading the NOUN 91, is he reading is he going to monitor real time with VERB 16 or VERB 06? [Long pause]
071:07:23 Eisele: I am using 16, Tom, and I am hitting a NOUN to freeze it when I get right on.
Comm break.
071:08:28 Stafford: Okay. That sounds good, Donn. Sounds real good.

This is Apollo Control Houston 71 hours 17 minutes into the flight. Over Carnarvon a few minutes ago, we had some conversation. We - the crew was quite busy doing star alignment and getting our attitudes set up for the next pass across the States. They - the transponder, the radar transponder test out of White Sands, they are to be blunt end forward, since the 00 attitudes, that is aligned straight upright, blunt end leading, as they come across the White Sands Missile Range near Los Cruces, New Mexico. And precisely one alignment they will have, I think they will simply go amiss, the flight plan shows they go into free drift after the White Sands pass. We planned to tell them, as they started across the States, Tom Stafford called several times and they were busy and didn't get the word via the Honeysuckle station in east Australia, but we do want to tell them that we are planning a minor burn later today to adjust their apogee and to make our total onboard fuel redlines a little more acceptable all the way around. They are not out of alignment with the overall program as planned but the affect of an adjusting burn would be to lower apogee somewhat and to bring those redline values even into more conservation views. Here is the tape by Carnarvon.
HUNTSVILLE trough BERMUDA (REV 45)
071:34:09 Stafford: Hello, Apollo 7, this is Houston through the Huntsville. [Long pause]
071:34:30 Stafford: Hello, Apollo 7, this iS Houston through the Huntsville. [Long pause]
071:34:51 Stafford: Hello, Apollo 7. This is Houston. [Pause]
071:34:57 Communications technician: Huntsville AOS. [Pause]
071:35:03 Unidentifiable crewmember: Standing by.
071:35:04 Stafford: Hello, Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read? [Long pause]
071:35:20 Unidentifiable crewmember: [Garble]. [Pause]
071:35:24 Stafford: Roger. Coming very weak, Apollo 7. How do you read? Houston. [Long pause]
071:35:39 Schirra: This is Apollo 7. Do you read? Over.
071:35:41 Stafford: Roger. Now reading you about three-by. How did the alignment go? [Long pause]
071:36:19 Unidentifiable crewmember: Two-way lock. [Pause]
071:36:23 Stafford: Hello, Apollo 7, this is Houston. How do you read? Over. [Pause]
071:36:27 Schirra: We are aligned at this time so I'm getting you in the blind. [Pause]
071:36:33 Stafford: Roger. Understand you are aligned.
This is Apollo Control Houston. 71 hours, 37 minutes into the flight. We are trying to establish com with the crew by the Huntsville station, and the signal is very shakey, as you recall in the earlier passes, the Huntsville com has not been the best and it is no better today. In a few minutes we expect to acquire through Guaymas. In a very cloudy communication, cloudy voice communication with Apollo 7 a few minutes ago, the crew commander advised that they were GO for this pass, GO for the transponder test at White Sands, and GO for the television through Corpus. We should acquire by the Guaymas station - stand by I - we'll acquire at 738 which is right now and now Wally is coming in loud and clear." [Long pause]
071:37:14 Stafford: Apollo 7, this is Houston tbrough the Huntsville. We'll be piking you up over California, Guaymas shortly. [Pause]
071:37:20 Schirra: Roger. You are coming in very weak. We are aligned. I am alining the GDC at this time. [Pause]
071:37:25 Stafford: Roger. Good show. Understand you are aligning the GDC. [Pause]
071:37:30 Schirra: [Garble]. [Pause]
071:37:34 Stafford: Say again, Wally.
071:37:37 Schirra: Houston, do you want TV this pass?
071:37:40 Stafford: Roger. We'd like to get WSMR and TV if we could. [Pause]
071:37:46 Schirra: Roger. Let's give it a go.
071:37:48 Stafford: Roger. [Long pause]
071:38:45 Schirra: Hello, Houston, Apollo 7. How do you read now? [Pause]
071:38:49 Stafford: Apollo 7, this is Houston. Loud and clear. How's that for you?
071:38:51 Stafford: Roger. you're coming in loud and clear, Wally. Sounds like, that alignment technique worked out pretty good, right?
071:38:54 Schirra: I'm just picking up my ORDEAL right now. [Pause]
071:39:01 Stafford: Good show.
071:39:02 Schirra: Star angle difference is about .18 degrees.
071:39:05 Stafford: That's not bad.
071:39:07 Cunningham: Tom, we went ahead and did a P54 alignment to the align time that you gave us to [garble] of 70 hours and 58 minutes. [Pause]
071:39:15 Stafford: Okay. That's what we wanted.
071:39:17 Cunningham: Okay.
071:39:18 Schirra: Okay. We'll try to [garble] attltude [garble]. [Pause]
071:39:24 Stafford: Roger. What we want you to do for WSMR pass - and this will be over on Watt's side - we want the DSE recorded in lov bit rate for the test. We want the DSE to start at 71 plus 39 plus 00. We want the DSE to stop at 71:46 plus 00. [Long pause]
071:39:50 Cunningham: Roger. We got it.
071:39:52 Stafford: Okay. Now after we finish WSMR, when we come up for the TV pass for - Walt, make sure that the tape position is OFF. Over. [Long pause]
071:40:05 Cunningham: Roger.
071:40:05 Schirra (onboard): Roger, just stand by and keep panning.
071:40:06 Stafford: Okay.
071:40:08 Cunningham: Tape OFF now. [Long pause]
071:40:21 Stafford: Okay. Walt, againn, the tape should stop the DSE, and the tape OFF at 71 plus 46. [Pause]
071:40:28 Cunningham: The tape is stopped now, and the DSE is running, and I can keep the DSE running. Can I keep the DSE running with the TV on? [Long pause]
071:40:40 Stafford: Yes, you sure can, Walt. No problem. [Pause]
071:40:44 Cunningham: Roger. [Long pause]
071:41:19 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston. Looks like we have a real pretty day down here. [Pause]
071:41:23 Schirra: Roger. That's the way it looks from here. [Long pause]
071:42:06 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7.
071:42:08 Stafford: Go ahead.
071:42:09 Cunningham: Roger. At what time do you want the TV turned on
071:42:12 Stafford: Say again.
071:42:14 Cunningham: At what time do you want the TV turned on?
071:42:16 Stafford: Stand by. Roger. We are ready for TV now. Turn it on. [Long pause]
071:42:35 Cunningham: TV going on. Let us know when you are receiving a picture.
This is Apollo COntrol here. We just heard Walt Cunningham acknowledge he was turning on the TV. We are looking at a rather snowy TV screen and we see nothing at this point." [Pause]
071:42:42 Stafford: Okay. It goes through a scan converter. We're looking at it now. [Pause]
071:42:47 Cunningham: Can you read it?
071:42:48 Stafford: Well, we're looking - down here. Just stand by and keep panning. [Pause]
071:42:53 Cunningham: Roger. [Long pause]
071:43:32 Eisele: Hey, Tom, would you repeat the time for DSE STOP? I was down below when you gave it last time. [Pause]
071:43:38 Stafford: Say again.
071:43:41 Eisele: Repeat the time for DSE STOP.
071:43:44 Stafford: DSE at 71 plus 46 plus 00. [Pause]
071:43:48 Eisele: Roger. 46.
071:43:51 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston. Verify you're on omni Alpha. [Pause]
071:43:56 Cunningham: Verified.
Still nothing - a little snow pattern. Which is considered just normal TV line noise. Most of the flight controllers have the proper channel punched up. And now we are getting some indication from the network controller that the signal is too weak to read. We are 71 hours and 43 minutes into the flight. And we are about, nearly 1 minute beyond the time of the planned Corpus acquisition. Here comes the picture and it's White. We look at Eisele, nice shot. Looks straight up, and he's moving. He's really quite clear; let's all have a look at it.
071:43:58 Stafford: Roger. Looks like the signal strength is a little low down here.
071:44:01 Schirra (onboard): Okay, we're watching.
HUNTSVILLE through BERMUDA (REV 46)
071:44:03 Cunningham: I'm reading 1 volt is all, and we did not get a full 20 minutes to warm up on that thing. [Pause]
071:44:12 Cunningham (onboard): We're getting 1 volt on our test meter.
071:44:15 Stafford: Okay.
071:44:18 Stafford: Hey, we got you. I can see Eisele talking there. Hey, Donn, turn your head to the right. There you go. Hey, we're picking up - I can read it; just a minute. It says, "From that lovely Apollo," something - you guys shoud write - "High atop something." It looks good; I can see Wally handle it now, and Donn has a smile on his face, and there's Walt. "From the Lovely Apollo Room High Atop Everything." The definition is pretty good down here; I can see the center hatch. Actually I am amazed; it looks real good. Hey, Donn, how about saying something since you're panned. [Long pause]
071:45:08 Eisele: Say again.
071:45:09 Stafford: Hey, I can read you and can see you loud and clear. It really looks good. I am amazed. [Pause]
071:45:19 Eisele: It's coming in heads down. You want us to point...
071:45:22 Stafford: Lean back a little bit; you are too close to the camera. There you are. We'll have Cecil B. De Stafford down here directing. [Pause]
071:45:30 Eisele (onboard): (Laughter.)
071:45:31 Eisele: Roger.
071:45:32 Stafford: You forgot to shave this morning, Eisele. [Pause]
071:45:36 Eisele: Lost my razor.
071:45:39 Stafford: Some of the reproductions here are real good. I can look out through Wally's rendezvous window. I can see the COAS up there, the ORB RATE ball. [Long pause]
071:45:50 Schirra: We're looking right down the Gulf Coast.
071:45:52 Stafford: Okay. What's the next one? Little closer, Wally. [Pause]
071:45:57 Stafford: It says, 'keep those cards and letters coming in, Folks.' It's loud and clear. [Long pause]
071:46:13 Cunningham: Yes, sir, there's plenty show for the whole family. Would you like to get a look out the window with the TV camera? I can give you New Orleans right here. [Pause]
071:46:18 Stafford: Okay. Let's take a look and see how New Orleans is this morning.
Apollo Control here. You were listening primarily to Tom Stafford talk with the crew; Deke Slayton threw in a couple of lines. Here we are with a view out the window." [Long pause]
071:46:38 Cunningham: Roger. Coming up over the Mississippi River. I'm giving you an out-the-window picture. You should see Lake Pontchartrain coming into view now. [Long pause]
071:46:50 Stafford: Okay. We're looking. [Pause]
071:46:58 Schirra: We're changing lenses. That's a pretty wide Lake Ponchatrain he gave you. [Pause]
071:47:02 Stafford: Okay.
The crew reports that they are changing lenses and that they are right over Lake Ponchatrain outside New Orleans." [Pause]
071:47:06 Cunningham: There you go.
071:47:07 Stafford: Roger. You got the telephoto cm there? [Pause]
071:47:12 Schirra: We are just crossing about now over Mobile Bay. [Pause]
071:47:16 Stafford: Okay.
071:47:17 Schirra: Should get it about now.
071:47:18 Stafford: Okay. We're starting to get it. Looks like there's a few clouds down there. Yes, we can see it. Is that the coastline you're panning right now? [Long pause]
071:47:33 Schirra: Going over Mobile now, and quickly, and we'll be coming across Pensacola shortly. [Pause]
071:47:38 Stafford: Okay. Wally, can you focus one spot for a minute? We can see the orbital rate coming in real fast. There you go. Try to hold it on one spot. Now you can see the coastline. [Pause]
071:47:48 Schirra: There's a paper mill north of Pensacola that I'll train on. [Long pause]
071:48:02 Stafford: Okay.
071:48:04 Schirra: We have a beautiful day; you're right. Should give you a good shot of the Cape today.
071:48:07 Stafford: All right. Yes, there's the coastline; it's coming in good. [Pause]
071:48:14 Schirra: Roger.
071:48:15 Stafford: Real good. [Pause]
071:48:19 Schirra: You might get a kick out of the fact the constellation we used for alignment was [garble]. [Pause]
071:48:24 Stafford: All right. [Pause]
071:48:33 Schirra: [Garble] we used for alignment.
071:48:36 Stafford: Okay. Are you passing over Florida now?
071:48:38 Schirra: Affirmative.
071:48:39 Stafford: Okay. If you can just hold it. The big thing on that long lens is just to hold it still for one spot and then move to another, it looks like. You can sure see orbital motion. [Long pause]
071:49:03 Schirra: Tom, we used [garble] for alignment if you haven't figured it out yet. [Pause]
071:49:08 Stafford: You're coming in garbled, Wally, So I couldn't hear you.
071:49:11 Schirra: Guess what constellation we used for the alignment? [Pause]
071:49:19 Stafford: Okay. Stand by. We'll get it.
071:49:21 Schirra: Negative. It was Orion.
071:49:23 Stafford: Oh, I thought you said Urian.
071:49:25 Schirra: You're right.
Apollo Control here. Among the more interested viewers of these live pictures as they come in is Wally Schirra's wife, Jo Schirra, who I just observed lighted her second cigarette in the course of this pass. She's with Marjorie Slayton, the wife of the flight crew operations director here in the Control Center." [Long pause]
071:49:37 Schirra: We're switching lenses again, Tom.
071:49:40 Stafford: Okay. [Pause]
071:49:46 Stafford: Okay. It looks like we lost TV, and we've done some spade work down here. Looks like we found out what's wrong with the MARK button. [Pause]
071:49:52 Schirra: Very good.
071:49:55 Stafford: Okay. It looks like there is an improper exit from a program yesterday, and if the IMU's aligned, we'll select program 20. If you got a piece of paper, we'll copy it down. [Long pause]
071:50:06 Schirra: okay. I'm checking the fuel right now so I'll know how much that cost us. Okay. Ready to copy.
Apollo Control here it looks like we are out on the edge of the Cape acquisition here; here we come in sharp again, it looks like they brought the camera back inside." [Pause]
071:50:12 Stafford: Okay. Go ahead and select program 20. You'll then do VERB 57 ENTER. After that, you will key ENTER, and then you will select program 00. Now what that does is cause a reset of flag word 2 bit 14 which is SET, which has prevented that MARK from getting in. [Long pause]
071:50:42 Schirra: You broke up after key ENTER, Tom. We have program 20, VERB 57 ENTER, then key in ENTER, then program something. [Pause]
071:50:48 Stafford: Then select P00, p-zero-zero.
And Apollo Control here. We have lost the picture; apparently have lost lock - here's something more from the crew." [Long pause]
071:51:31 Stafford: Hello, Apollo 7, Houston.
071:51:32 Schirra: Go ahead, Tom.
071:51:35 Stafford: Roger. Did you get That procedure okay?
071:51:38 Schirra: We copied. It was program 20, VERB 57 ENTER, key in ENTER, then back to P00. That I picked up. [Pause]
071:51:45 Stafford: Roger. That should reset that flag word, and you should be all set to use program 51 and 52 as normal.
That's affirmative; now we have lost lock; the spacecraft is out near Bermuda. However, we are now ready to give you the NASA instant replay of that entire pass. Could we see the tape from the I am sorry - it is not quite ready yet. The picture came in remarkably clear and it was some time after Cunningham reported turning the switch on. We looked at it quite awhile and it seemed to me, we'll have to go back and listen to the tape itself; but it seemed to me the clarity came up about 200 percent when we changed lens. Then another lens change was made as Walt Cunningham put it out the right hatch, the right side window. Standby 1 and see if we are ready with the tape." [Pause]
071:51:53 Schirra: [Garble].
071:51:55 Stafford: And again, I can't tell you how good the TV picture looked down here inside the spacecraft. Just beautiful. [Pause]
071:52:03 Schirra: Roger. We estimate two cards for later.
071:52:06 Stafford: Okay. One thing we'd like to talk to you about now is hoy we are going to change the flight plan a little bit. [Long pause]
071:52:19 Schirra: Go ahead.
071:52:20 Stafford: Okay. Because of that AC glitch last night and the present status of the RCS fuel, we're going to move the third SPS burn up to today. And we're going to plan to make that burn about 75 hours 48 minutes, so we have about 4 hours to go in which that will bring the perigee on down to 90 miles, and then we'll be way inside the redlane. [Long pause]
071:52:50 Schirra: Roger. I think that last pass for our last alignment problenis an example of why I didn't want to eat up our fuel earlier [garble] of the rather obscure DPO's. The land we saw was an example of why I didn't want to eat up our fuel earlier [garble] rather obscure DPO's. [Long pause]
071:53:02 Stafford: Okay.
071:53:03 Schirra: This is still the first flight.
071:53:04 Stafford: Roger. [Pause]
071:53:14 Cunningham: Tom, when you pass up the total RCS propellant remaining, I would like to get a readout for each quad, also. [Long pause]
071:53:29 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston.
071:53:31 Cunningham: Go ahead.
071:53:32 Stafford: Okay. What we'll plan to do is put you the NAV load for this maneuver up over the Canaries, and we'll be passing over that in about another 4 to 5 minutes. [Long pause]
071:53:46 Schirra: Roger. Standing by.
071:53:49 Stafford: So if you get a chance, go ahead and select program 00. [Pause]
071:53:54 Schirra: We have already tried to work that. It didn't work so we'll go back into P7. [Pause]
071:53:58 Stafford: Okay.
Long comm break.
