CALIFORNIA (REV 106)
168:01:38 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through California. [Pause]
168:01:44 Schirra: Roger. I want to record a comment that people ought to be concerned about the high forces on the switches that may close a loop by touching a liquid at the same time they activate the switch. As a result, we don't move around the cockpit. [Pause]
168:02:03 Communications Technician: It's on its way, Roy.
168:02:06 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
168:02:41 Swigert: Apollo 7, would you turn up your S-band so we can get you S-band though Goldstone? [Long pause]
GOLDSTONE through ANTIGUA (REV 106)
168:03:41 Swigert: Apollo 7, how are you reading through Goldstone?
168:03:46 Schirra: Loud and clear.
168:03:48 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
168:04:30 Schirra: We're starting into perigee and BEF, and it looks like it's going to slip right over to SCS, so I'll just let her ride. [Long pause]
168:04:41 Swigert: Okay. copy that. [Long pause]
168:04:56 Schirra: I want to see if it stays at SCS. Apparently, it likes SCS best. [Pause]
168:05:02 Swigert: Roger. It's streamline, I guess. [Pause]
168:05:06 Schirra: Yes, it does.
168:05:08 Swigert: And, Wally, Joe is in the viewing room. [Pause]
168:05:16 Schirra: Very good. I'll drop in some time next week.
168:05:19 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
168:05:27 Schirra: I'll drop in the fun room and thank you cats for a pretty good show. [Pause]
168:05:32 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
168:05:44 Schirra: Assuming Lew Allen and Bill Shaffer can target pretty well. [Pause]
168:05:51 Swigert: He'll be happy to hear that. [Long pause]
168:06:14 Swigert: Roger.
168:06:16 Schirra: All we're doing is pulsing yaw and roll here, Jack. [Pause]
168:06:20 Swigert: Okay.
168:06:21 Schirra: Just looking right over the top.
168:06:22 Swigert: Okay. Okay. Copy that.
168:06:24 Schirra: We ought to have enough time to go on around on the roof in apogee.. [Long pause]
168:06:54 Schirra: [Garble] the clock since we started our flight. [Pause]
168:06:58 Swigert: I didn't copy that, Wally.
168:07:00 Schirra: You can see the radial develop into a process giving the same attitude as we did at 57. [Pause]
168:07:09 Swigert: Okay. Copy that, Wally.
168:07:11 Schirra: And we're not at perigee yet either, are we? [Pause]
168:07:21 Swigert: Not quite at perigee, Wally.
168:07:24 Schirra: About 13? [Long pause]
168:07:44 Swigert: Wally, you will be at perigee in 7 minutes.
168:07:47 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
168:07:51 Schirra: Jack, the torque changes even faster than it has before. [Pause]
168:07:56 Schirra: One-tenth per second in pitch. [Pause]
168:08:02 Swigert: Roger. Copy. [Pause]
168:08:06 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, have you guys figured any leveling off of this condenser drop temperature yet? [Long pause]
168:08:18 Swigert: Okay. Walt, it appears to be leveling off slightly, but we're still watching it. It's not conclusive yet. [Pause]
168:08:25 Cunningham: Roger.
168:08:27 Schirra: On this - PTA where we had attitude hold MAX deadband: we had MAX deadband rate power LOW and limit cycle ON and OFF. [Long pause]
168:08:38 Swigert: Okay. Stand by.
168:08:40 Schirra: Okay. [Long pause]
168:09:13 Swigert: Roger. Wally, that will be rates LOW, limit cycle OFF. [Pause]
168:09:21 Schirra: And MAX deadband only. Okay. [Pause]
168:09:26 Schirra: We're almost up to six-tenths of a degree per second here.
168:09:30 Swigert: Roger. We're copying the rates.
168:09:32 Schirra: Great. I think we all agree it was a good idea to shift this thing.
168:09:36 Swigert: Roger.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston. We've been watching the biomedical values as the Apollo 7 sails overhead, and we're getting biomedical on Walt Cunningham. We're showing right now a heart rate of 68, there it switched to 67 beats per minute, and all other quantities look quite normal. He is apparently moving around. We've seen a variation in the heart of about 10 beats per minute. He must be moving around the cabin a little bit. The cabin itself is still holding at 5.1, cabin temperature a very steady 68 degrees.
GOLDSTONE through ANTIGUA (REV 107)
168:11:33 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
168:11:38 Schirra: Go ahead.
168:11:39 Swigert: Wally, when we begin this SCS attitude control test, we'll get a little more information down here on telemetry if you'll put your GDC on FDAI number 1. [Long pause]
168:11:52 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
168:11:59 Schirra: We're really whistling around up here.
168:12:03 Swigert: And we're seeing those rates.
168:12:06 Schirra: We're having our noon chow with pea soup and all that good stuff right now.
168:12:12 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
168:12:18 Schirra: Nobody will swap for the bite size. They're just throwing them all away.
168:12:24 Swigert: Copy that. [Long pause]
168:12:44 Swigert: 7, when do you feel you will be getting into SPS cold soak attitude?
168:12:51 Schirra: Oh, soon as this rate starts dropping off, Jack. I've got six-tenths; it's decreasing now, so I should hit 180 pretty shortly. [Pause]
168:13:00 Swigert: Okay. Copy.
168:13:03 Schirra: I'll stop it on this revolution here.
168:13:06 Swigert: Okay. [Pause]
168:13:14 Schirra: I'll be going through a - about 75 degrees pitch down.
168:13:18 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
168:13:25 Schirra: Are we going over Bermuda?
168:13:29 Swigert: You are going down the islands just north of Cuba.
168:13:33 Schirra: Okay.
Comm break.
168:15:08 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, how about a map update, please.
168:15:12 Swigert: In work, Walt. [Long pause]
168:15:23 Schirra: Notice how the rate has damped out. [Pause]
168:15:29 Swigert: Roger, Wally. [Long pause]
168:15:51 Swigert: Walt, we're showing that oxidizer line temperature is getting close to the heater limit. You might look for that. [Long pause]
168:16:03 Cunningham: I have been operating my heaters on the propellant tank line temperature. [Pause]
168:16:08 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
168:16:12 Schirra: I have just shot frames 20 and 21 of islands in coral reef, magazine R.
168:16:18 Swigert: Copy.
168:16:21 Schirra: 18 and 19 also.
Comm break.
168:17:29 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. I have your map update.
168:17:32 Cunningham: Roger.
168:17:34 Swigert: Okay. Walt, for REV 110: time of the node 173 plus 44 plus 35, longitude 64.6 degrees east. [Pause]
168:17:57 Cunningham: Roger. [Long pause]
168:18:14 Schirra: And frame 16, magazine R was another island in that same chain.
168:18:22 Swigert: Roger. Copy that. [Long pause]
168:18:54 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, do you have the time of our closest approach to Ascension?
168:19:01 Swigert: Stand by, Walt. [Long pause]
168:19:49 Swigert: Walt, your time of crossing Ascension will be approximately 32:48. [Pause]
168:19:59 Cunningham: 32:48? Looks like we come pretty close to it. [Pause]
168:20:05 Swigert: Roger.
Comm break.
168:21:45 Schirra: We're going to that attitude now.
168:21:48 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
Long comm break.
168:22:10 Schirra (onboard): [Garble] put that in there, but too faulty [garble] cycle.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, 168 hours, 23 minutes and that will wrap up the communications of the stateside pass. We'll be up in Ascension in a few minutes.
ASCENSION (REV 107)
168:28:56 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Long pause]
168:29:30 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Long pause]
168:30:27 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Pause]
168:30:32 Schirra: Roger.
Long comm break.
168:36:24 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We're about to lose you at Ascension; pick you up at Tananrive at 168 plus 44.
Long comm break.
168:38:40 Cunningham (onboard): This is LMP, 20 clicks of water.
This is Apollo Control, 168 hours, 39 minutes into the flight. At Ascension, we simply had a callup and identification, no comments. That will probably be Tananarive in about 3 or 4 minutes. We want to alert you to the fact that at 45 minutes after the hour this morning, 3 minutes from now, we will be showing through the Houston News Center, the tape of yesterday's television pass. The tape of yesterday's television pass, it's been run through our machine, it's the original tape recorded at the station. It is quite cleaned up and it is well worth seeing. We heartily recommend it to you. At 168 hours, 40 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
TANANARIVE (REV 107)
168:46:16 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. [Long pause]
168:46:19 Schirra (onboard): Roger, loud and clear. Do you read me, Jack?
168:46:24 Schirra (onboard): Houston, do you read Apollo 7?
168:46:37 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Comm break.
168:46:41 Schirra (onboard): Roger, loud and clear. How me?
168:46:46 Schirra (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7.
168:47:05 Schirra (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read?
168:47:35 Schirra (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read now?
168:47:46 Communications Technician (onboard): That's affirmative.
168:47:47 Schirra (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read?
168:48:04 Schirra (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7. Over.
168:48:31 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Long comm break.
168:48:35 Schirra (onboard): Roger, do you read now?
168:48:38 Schirra (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7.
168:52:51 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Tananarive; Carnarvon on the hour.
Long comm break.
168:52:55 Schirra (onboard): Roger, do you read me now, Jack?
168:53:00 Schirra (onboard): Houston; Apollo 7.
168:53:44 Cunningham (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, 169 hours, 1 minute into the flight and some 5 minutes ago at ground elapsed time 168 hours, 56 minutes, we have experienced a rather massive loss of circuits throughout our world net including the Goddard - the terminus - the hub of this data network which is Greenbelt, Maryland, the Goddard Space Flight Center. At first we thought the loss was confined to our high speed data circuits, since then the network flight controllers confirm that we've lost all our data circuits. We do have a good voice communications circuit, however, of course, to all stations and to the spacecraft and we'll operate with it. The effect of this is we'll only be able to read data when the spacecraft is overhead. We'll keep you advised as to the progress, we expect it's probably only a momentary dropout. We'll give you a status report on it as soon as it's available. We're in touch with the spacecraft over Carnarvon, let's listen to the conversation.
CARNARVON (REV 107)
169:00:18 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7 here.
169:00:21 Swigert: Roger, 7. Go ahead; we're standing by.
169:00:24 Schirra: Okay. Jack, I understood that you wanted to knock off the attitude hold at 169 hours and 10 minutes. Does that mean you want to terminate the test at that time as well?
169:00:36 Swigert: Stand by, Wally.
169:00:40 Cunningham: Jack, a little further on that - we're sitting at 65 now on the SPS propellant tank temperature, and it's lowest it's been, and it's not about to get down to any 45 by the end of this test.
169:00:45 Swigert: Roger. Understand, Walt. Stand by.
Comm break.
169:02:03 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
169:02:06 Cunningham: Go, Jack.
169:02:07 Swigert: Okay. Walt, on the SPS temperatures: we've had a data loss here. We hope to be back in shape at Guam, and we'll take a look at the temperatures there and give you a little bit further hack on this colt soak test. And on the termination of the attitude control test at ten: that was for the MIN deadband high rate; then we pick up this MAX deadband low rate test from there on. We should be through with that before we get down into perigee. [Long pause]
169:02:38 Schirra: I'm MAX deadband low rate now.
169:02:40 Swigert: Okay. Real fine.
169:02:42 Schirra: 41 and 10, MAX deadband high rate? [Pause]
169:02:51 Swigert: Roger.
169:02:52 Schirra: If we go MAX deadband in high rate, that will be good enough for the cold soak, so I'll do that at ten.
169:02:59 Swigert: Okay. The attitude before should have been MIN deadband high rate; now we should be MAX deadband low rate.
169:03:06 Schirra: Okay. I'll reverse it; I had MAX deadband low rate so far.
169:03:12 Swigert: Okay. That pick it up MIN deadband high rate, and we'll try to get done before we go through perigee.
169:03:20 Schirra: Okay. I'll switch it now, then, Jack, just to make it early.
169:03:25 Swigert: Okay. [Pause]
169:03:30 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, you may have lost your data readout, but I've got good ones on board here; and I've checked the oxidizer line temperature down the wall, and it looks like it's a little - something a little under 170. Propellant tank temperatures are 165, and that should be as good as your data readout. What I'm saying is that we're never going to get down to the point where I'm going to kick a heater out. I might suggest that when we do terminate this test, it will be useful to turn on the SPS line heaters to A slash B and watch for a rise at least to sea if they're working at all. [Pause]
169:04:02 Swigert: Okay. We copy that.
169:04:06 Cunningham: Okay. Do you concur with that?
169:04:09 Swigert: We're going to put that in the mill and discuss it here. [Pause]
169:04:16 Schirra: Jack, on Tananarive, it turns out you can broadcast in the blind to us there, and the odds are we'll get it, but we can't seem to talk back to you.
169:04:25 Swigert: Okay. Fine, Wally.
169:04:26 Schirra: We'd like you to pass that on to the other flight controllers.
169:04:30 Swigert: Will do.
169:04:31 Schirra: Thank you.
Comm break.
169:06:14 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
169:06:17 Schirra: Go ahead, Jack.
169:06:18 Swigert: Roger. We've got data back now, and we need about 40 minutes at this MIN deadband high rate; then you can return to the normal cold soak attitude configuration. [Pause]
169:06:35 Cunningham: Would you say that is a new good configuration - you want 40 minutes of it - and that you want to keep going with this cold soak test?
169:06:44 Swigert: Affirm. We'll look at it over Guam and see what the trend is there.
169:06:50 Cunningham: If you don't hear data, you can always ask me on the loop, and I'll give you my readouts. They're supposed to be prime.
169:06:57 Swigert: Okay. We've got data now. [Pause]
169:07:03 Schirra: [Garble].
169:07:04 Schirra (onboard): Just remind the guys that's possible, though.
169:07:12 Swigert: Say again, Wally.
169:07:15 Schirra: Could you find the COMSAT operation? We lost the line down there some place. [Pause]
169:07:28 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, can yon give me a readout of hydrogen tank 1 quantity and hydrogen tank 2 quantity what you show?
169:07:35 Swigert: Okay. Stand by. [Long pause]
169:07:48 Schirra: Jack, the reason I made that remark - after about 8 days of staring at clocks down there, I'm sure you guys are begining to think they're all right.
169:07:57 Swigert: Roger. Wally, we'll get back to yon on that; we'll discuss that pretty closely, and I'm getting your tank quantities, Walt.
169:08:06 Schirra: Very good. [Pause]
169:08:15 Swigert: Walt, on the hydrogen quantitiy: tank 1 39.8, tank 2 37.6. [Pause]
169:08:24 Cunningham: Roger. I'll continue with the balancing. I'm wondering about the feasibility of maybe overshooting about 1 percent with tank 1.
169:08:37 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
This is Apollo Control, Houston. The spacecraft control system attitude test is continuing and we've been advised that we've had partial restoration of service on our data network. It is not yet fully up, but we have one or two circuits that have been restored to use. We'll keep you advised. Here's more conversation through Carnarvon.
169:08:51 Swigert: And, 7, we're about 1 minute LOS Carnarvon; we pick up Guam at 169:12.
169:08:57 Schirra: Roger. With perigee only 36 minutes away, you want 40 minutes on this control mode. That should be interesting.
169:09:02 Swigert: Roger. Wally, we had intended to do the MIN deadband high rate first to minimize the RCS firing as we went through perigee. [Long pause]
169:09:15 Schirra (onboard): They're about the same.
169:09:16 Schirra: [Garble].
Long comm break.
And that wraps up the conversation by Carnarvon. We'll acquire Guam in 4 minutes. Apollo Control, Houston.
GUAM (REV 107)
169:12:48 Communications Technician (onboard): Apollo 7, Guam.
169:12:49 Communications Technician (onboard): Okay, go ahead.
169:13:09 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Guam.
169:13:12 Schirra: Roger. Loud and clear.
169:13:15 Swigert: Roger. Wally, we ...
169:13:16 Schirra: I was just thinking we are getting worried about all the paper work; it's accumulating on our desks about preparing for this mission.
169:13:23 Swigert: Roger. Wally, we have a state vector update and a DAP update we would like to send you. Would you go to ACCEPT?
169:13:31 Schirra: You got it.
169:13:32 Swigert: Coming up. [Pause]
169:13:41 Swigert: And, Walt, I have the NAV check PAD to read whenever you are ready to copy. [Pause]
169:13:49 Schirra: What time is perigee? I have it written as 44. [Pause]
169:14:01 Swigert: Okay. Wally, that's about right ...
169:14:02 Cunningham: Go with your NAV update.
169:14:04 Swigert: Okay. The NAV check: GET of 175 plus 30 plus 0000 plus 2562 plus 09300 1407. [Pause]
169:14:30 Cunningham: Roger. 175 30 0000 plus 2562 plus 09300 1407. Over.
169:14:38 Swigert: Roger. That's correct. [Long pause]
169:15:04 Swigert: And, Walt, I have - I would like to read you up the verification of the DAP data load we are passing you.
169:15:11 Cunningham: Roger. We can read it right back to you in a minute.
169:15:14 Schirra: Is that the end of the update? [Pause]
169:15:20 Swigert: Negative.
169:15:22 Schirra: Okay. standing by.
169:15:23 Cunningham: Go ahead with the DAP update, Jack.
169:15:26 Swigert: Okay. NOUN 47 - I'll read you R1, R2, and R3: plus 00139 plus 00455 plus 29921 NOUN 48 minus 00078 minus 00130 plus 02412. [Long pause]
169:16:17 Swigert: Were you able to copy that, 7?
169:16:19 Cunningham: I didn't get the NOUN 48. Would you say NOUN 48?
169:16:22 Swigert: Okay. Minus three balls 78 minus two balls 130 plus 02412. [Long pause]
169:16:39 Schirra: Is the update finished?
169:16:42 Swigert: Affirmative, Wally. The computer is yours. [Long pause]
169:17:24 Schirra: That's GO on NAV update. [Pause]
169:17:31 Swigert: Say again, Wally?
169:17:33 Schirra: GO on that NAV update.
169:17:34 Swigert: Roger. Copy that. [Long pause]
Apollo Control here, 169 hours, 17 minutes into the flight. We are talking to the crew by Guam and we will cut in on that conversation in just a minute. First, I want to make clear that all data circuits have been restored. We advised earlier that we lost our data circuits - our ground data circuits at elapsed time of 168, 56 minutes. Within about 15 minutes, all circuits had been restored. And much of that 15 minute outage was due to the testing on the alternate routing circuits that were brought up when we lost - when we had the data dropout. The trouble has been traced immediately to three major system failures in the Kansas area. It's no better defined than that, but apparently in the Kansas area there were three major failures in a very short period of time about 40 or 50 circuits, and those are circuits other than the NASA circuits, were involved. Alternate readings are available for all those circuits and they were routed very quickly. As I say, to recap, we have full restoration of our data circuits now, and we are in touch with the spacecraft by Guam.
169:18:17 Swigert: And, 7. When you can, would you switch your BIOMED to LMP? [Pause]
169:18:26 Schirra: I want to remind you I'm going to break up another plug today and leave it off. There's a broken wire I don't want to have on when I put the suit back on.
169:18:38 Swigert: Roger. Copy that. [Long pause]
169:18:50 Cunningham: Should that program be stuck in P00 this long? [Pause]
169:19:00 Swigert: Stand by.
169:19:02 Schirra: We are running in P00 here. We'll let it ride out for while.
169:19:08 Cunningham: You probably won't get anything on my BIOMED, Jack. [Pause]
169:19:19 Swigert: Okay. Wally, we feel that the computer will be finished with program 00 just shortly and Roger on your BIOMED data, Walt. [Long pause]
169:19:45 Cunningham: NOUN 47 - NOUN 48 is GO.
169:19:49 Swigert: Roger. Copy, that. [Pause]
169:20:00 Cunningham: Does everybody down there concur with letting hydrogen tank 1 get down about 1 percent lower than tank 2?
169:20:08 Swigert: In work, Walt.
169:20:10 Schirra: Okay. Perigee is at 45 now.
169:20:14 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
169:20:35 Swigert: Walt, we would like to balance these hydrogen tanks as close as possible to each other.
169:20:42 Cunningham: Understand. I will stand by for your call. I show right now that they are getting pretty close; I'd say may be 2 percent apart.
169:20:53 Swigert: We'll give you a call.
169:20:57 Swigert: And we are 1 minute LOS Guam; we pick you up at Hawaii at 27.
169:21:02 Schirra: Very good.
Long comm break.
Apollo Control here, 169 hours, 28 minutes and we're in touch via Hawaii.
HAWAII (REV 107)
169:28:15 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
169:28:19 Schirra: Aloha.
169:28:21 Swigert: Walt. Could you tell what omni antenna you're on now?
169:28:26 Cunningham: Omni C.
169:28:28 Swigert: Okay for a COMM test here, and let us know if you switch omni's, will you? [Pause]
169:28:36 Cunningham: Well. I'm always operating A and C, switching when you call unless something comes up where I think something in between is better.
169:28:42 Swigert: Okay. Fine.
Long comm break.
Apollo Control here. The Network controller just advised the Flight Director we are back 99 percent full coverage now on our data and our voice line.
169:31:47 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, this is Walt. We took frames 37 and 38 of the [garble] portraits.
169:31:55 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
169:31:57 Cunningham: Magazine N.
169:31:58 Schirra: Jack, when can I put this in sloppy deadband?
169:32:04 Swigert: Okay. We'll get to that, Wally.
169:32:07 Schirra: Okay. [Garble].
169:32:11 Swigert: Okay. Copy.
169:32:13 Schirra: And if you've been reading our DSKY. you can see I'm pretty close to SCF. [Pause]
169:32:22 Swigert: Okay. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
169:32:25 Schirra: Okay. It starts torquing about [garble] as you approach perigee, about 20 minutes before perigee.
169:32:32 Swigert: Okay. I copy. [Long pause]
169:32:58 Swigert: Apollo 7, opposite omni. Wally, is it starting to torque now?
169:33:02 Schirra: Just a little bit. Why dont you let me flip it over and see if it starts hitting it pretty hard? [Pause]
169:33:08 Swigert: Okay. [Pause]
169:33:15 Schirra: I can actually feel the spacecraft working. It's starting to torque now. [Pause]
169:33:21 Swigert: Okay. [Long pause]
169:33:47 Schirra: Not as bad because of - why don't we see if we can stick with it because she's riding up the same way she would on inertial. Oh. I'll have to go back down [garble] GDT [garble]. [Pause]
169:34:09 Swigert: Okay. Wally, you can terminate the MIN deadband at any time now, depending on your thruster activity. We've got enough data at any time now. [Long pause]

169:38:04 Schirra: Houston, do you read? Apollo 7.
169:38:06 Swigert: Roger, 7. You are five-by.
169:38:08 Schirra: Okay. Do you see my GDC on number 1 ball? [Pause]
169:38:12 Swigert: We're - we don't have telemetry over the Huntsville, Wally.
169:38:17 Schirra: Okay. That's the third time; I just did it again. It flipped 180 degrees in pitch, and it did it on number 2 ball; it's terminated its discrepancy. I'll bave to do another real line of GDC. [Pause]
169:38:32 Swigert: Roger. You say this exists just on the number 1 FTI?
169:38:36 Schirra: That's affirmative.
169:38:38 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
169:38:47 Schirra: I have number 1 and 2 on the blockup ...
Comm break.
169:40:47 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
169:40:49 Schirra: There we go. Loud and clear.
169:40:51 Swigert: Roger.
169:40:52 Schirra: Okay. You got TM on me now?
169:40:55 Swigert: Affirmative.
169:40:56 Schirra: Okay. I'm on number 1 ball, IMU number 2, GDC, with ORDEAL ON. [Pause]
169:41:03 Swigert: Okay.
169:41:04 Schirra: I'll put nmnber 2 back to GDC; now can you see all this stuff. GDC on number 2 now, and it powers right in. Now, I'll put GDC on number 1. [Pause]
169:41:20 Swigert: Okay. Wally, we can't see number 2 ball data.
169:41:24 Schirra: There goes number 1 right now; that is Sayonara.
169:41:26 Swigert: Okay.
169:41:29 Schirra: It's a [garble] on GDC.
169:41:32 Swigert: Okay. Walt, we've got a - we are approaching a heater cycle on tank 1. We would like to have you read out AC 1, phase A, B, and C now, and then during the heater cycle. [Pause]
169:41:54 Cunningham: Roger. Phase A is 114-1/2, B is 116, C is 114-1/2. [Pause]
169:42:05 Swigert: Okay. And we will let you know - you don't have to watch it - we will let you know when the heaters come on; then you can read it out again. [Pause]
169:42:11 Cunningham: Roger. And what do you think about when we terminate this SPS DTO - and I would suggest we do that any time - how about turning the heaters on AB position for long enough to observe a temperature rise to be sure they are working? [Pause]
169:42:28 Swigert: Okay. Walt, we are still discussing that down here. Tentatively, the answer is negative. [Pause]
169:42:39 Cunningham: Okay. Just trying to help.
169:42:42 Schirra: Jack, I think we are pitching up by holding inertial attitude at about the rate we would want to torque up, so I guess we can just hang in here on this perigee.
169:42:51 Swigert: Okay.
169:42:54 Schirra: It's just about going through the same window.
169:42:59 Schirra: We lucked out. We went right through SCS at the right time.
169:43:05 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
169:43:12 Schirra: Don't let Shaffer get credit for that one, whatever you do.
169:43:17 Swigert: (Laughter) Roger.
Comm break.
169:44:22 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
169:44:25 Schirra: Go ahead.
169:44:27 Swigert: Walt, on your EKG problem: do you thtnk you will be able to restore the harness today?
169:44:34 Cunningham: I don't know how I'm ever going to restore it. We have taken a good look at the leads. I was told last night it was probably the sternal leads; all my connections are made up. Wally took a look at them; it looks like we've got all the connections made. The only thing I can think of is a broken inside the lead some place. Are you getting anything on me at all?
169:44:55 Swigert: Just respiration. Walt.
169:44:58 Schirra: Jack, I would like to check with you. Do you know which sternal lead it is? We could change the sensor, but that's about all. The wiring is intact.
169:45:07 Swigert: Okay.
169:45:08 Schirra: All of it. [Long pause]
169:45:20 Schirra: Okay. Might get those people to go to work on that Mickey-Mouse wiring. It is not up to the standards as far as durability is concerned for 7 or 8 days. [Pause]
169:45:30 Swigert: Okay. Wally, they tell me that should work. And, Walt, they say you might try to make the some fix that Wally did on his. [Pause]
169:45:45 Schirra: Do you want to put his - what you want to do - you going to give up EKG and keep respiration only?
169:45:54 Swigert: Stand by, Wally.
169:45:55 Cunningham: That's what you've got on me now, I think. [Pause]
169:46:08 Swigert: Okay. Walt, they want to swap respiration for EKG leads. [Pause]
169:46:20 Schirra: You mean you want to swap the plug connectors on the amplifiers, is that it? Signal conditioners?
169:46:31 Swigert: That's right.
169:46:32 Schirra: Okay. We will do that. It may take a little while.
169:46:36 Cunningham: If I can do it, I'll unhook the yellow one and hook it to the white one, and vice versa. I've got - what? Yes, I've got enough wire here so that they might even reach. Retool deal [garble].
169:46:48 Schirra: I think he could reach over to me with it with the wire he has.
169:46:52 Swigert: Copy that.

169:47:58 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
169:48:00 Swigert: Go ahead.
169:48:02 Schirra: I'd like to update you on my water chlorination system. We remarked on a discrepancy there last night. The container that holds the ampules - that have interfaces with the pen plunger that penetrates the water servicing valve: at interface, there is a brown fluid all around the system outside the - [Long pause]
169:48:47 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
169:49:14 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
169:49:16 Schirra: Roger. Did you read all right?
169:49:18 Swigert: Negative. Wally, we got a handover just about that time. Before we continue, could ve - we got a report that the heater is on. Could you read out your AC 1 phase A, B, and C again?
169:49:32 Cunningham: 114-1/2, 115-1/2, 114-1/2.
169:49:39 Swigert: Roger. Copy that.
169:49:41 Cunningham: Are you getting anything on me now?
169:49:44 Swigert: And, Wally, we got pretty much the same report on the chlorination system now. Have there been any changes from last night? [Pause]
169:49:55 Schirra: Negative. We're just about to watch to see it grow. That goop seems - to be rocking in the middle.
169:50:02 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
169:50:04 Schirra: That fitting in the water system was scheduled for chlorine later today.
169:50:10 Swigert: Okay. We copy that.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston here 169 hours, 51 minutes. Schirra's last transmission has triggered a little discussion here in the Control Center about this brown fluid as he described it, at the connection point or at the neck of the - leading into the water container. It was described also earlier in the day on the swing shift very similarly to the description we just heard. Our best guess is that it is an oxidized lubricant from somewhere, and apparently the person making this diagnosis of oxidized lubricant has more specific information on it because they're also sure it's non-toxic. In other words it wouldn't make any difference, any physical difference to the water, although apparently it's none too appetizing looking. The main question in the minds here is why don't the crew simply wipe the brown stain away. It's doubtful that we'll get any more comm through Antigua. The surgeon just advised that we did not have, to the best we know, there was no similar occurrence during our chamber test here in Houston called 2-TV1, which is a long term run of the command module in our big vacuum chamber. This will trigger a lot of checks and cross checks I'm sure throughout the center here and the contract plant in California. At 169 hours, 53 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
169:54:22 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
169:54:26 Schirra: Roger.
169:54:28 Swigert: Wally, we had a premature data LOS there. Could we get you to go your up-telemetry command switch to RESET NORMAL?
169:54:37 Schirra: I would like to restate on the chlorination that we find that every other day is satisfactory. We have no objection to that.
169:54:44 Swigert: Okay. Copy that. Wally, do you think that you could wipe off this brown spot?
169:54:49 Schirra: I guess we could. I'm not sure what it is, though. That's why.
169:54:54 Swigert: Okay.
169:54:56 Unidentifiable Crewmember: That's what I would do in my own home, but I'm not sure about the correct input in this biomedical log. There's realy nothing for it in my book up here. [Pause]
169:55:06 Schirra (onboard): It's way back [garble] up here.
169:55:10 Cunningham: If we wipe it off, who is going to get a chance to take a look at it afterwards to see what it was?
Very long comm break.
169:55:17 Cunningham (onboard): Are you reading my biomedical data now?
ASCENSION (REV 108)
170:06:00 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
170:06:02 Cunningham (onboard): Roger. How do you read, Jack?
170:06:05 Cunningham: Yes, this is Apollo 7. How do you read? [Pause]
170:06:13 Swigert: Roger, Walt. Standing by.
170:06:15 Cunningham: Roger. Can you check your log and find out what time I turned the H2 1 - H2 2 heater off this morning? [Pause]

170:07:51 Cunningham: And what are the readouts now on H2 1 and H2 2 quantities? [Pause]
170:08:03 Swigert: Including - 39.4, Walt, and 37.6.
170:08:10 Cunningham: Okay. They seem to be coming apart. If that's a little bit too slow, I can turn the fans off in tank 2. Just fix it up occasionally.

This is Apollo Control, Houston, 170 hours, 11 minutes into the flight. A few minutes ago before we left the Antigua area of acquisition the crew came back up and made some additional comments on this brown fluid, which occupied the later part of that pass. Here's that conversation and then we will bridge right into the Ascension acquisition.
TANANARIVE (REV 108)
170:20:50 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.

The flight directors advise we may get some comments on the cold soak tests as we pass through Tananarive. I think we'll probably determin by the quality of the communications circuit through that station today. We're standing by. This is Apollo Control. We don't expect any communication via Tananarive, so we'll take the line down now.

MERCURY through GUAM (REV 108)
170:47:23 Schirra (onboard): Roger. Houston, Apollo 7 here.
This is Apollo Control at 170 hours, 48 minutes into the flight. We are about to acquire through Guam but one additional word on that power outage which now has been,- or the data outage we recorded earlier. At that time it was indicated the trouble was somewhere in the middle west, Kansas was mentioned on the loop. The network flight controller has tracked it some more, and the trouble was traced to a place called Pinsboro, West Virginia, a major outage in a large carrier and routing immediate - immediate re-routing had to take place and it takes some minutes to test out and validate the alternate circuits to be used. Don Eisele is well into his sleep period and we are now in touch with the spacecraft by Guam.
170:48:40 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7. Standing by.
170:48:45 Swigert: Roger. Apollo 7, Houston.
170:48:47 Schirra: Not gonna try you any more.
170:48:50 Swigert: Roger. Relative to Walt's question on the SPS heater after the cold soak test: we do not - do not want to activate these heaters; we want to look at the data first. [Pause]
170:49:05 Schirra: Understand.
170:49:08 Swigert: And, Wally, we would like to do a fuel cell O2 purge at 171 plus 30. [Pause]
170:49:18 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause]
170:49:35 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, how are you reading my BIOMED now?
170:49:41 Swigert: Stand by, Walt. [Pause]
170:49:50 Swigert: Walt, you did good. work. We have good BIOMED data. [Pause]
170:49:55 Cunningham: All of it, or just EKG's, or what? [Pause]
170:50:00 Swigert: Just EKG.
170:50:04 Cunningham: Is my heart still pumping?
170:50:07 Swigert: Affirmative.
170:50:09 Cunningham: I feel relieved now.
170:50:12 Schirra: That thing is not going to work very long, either; it's just taut right across his stomach.
170:50:17 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
170:50:36 Schirra: Do you have amy more words of wisdom on the chlorine injector? [Pause]
170:50:43 Swigert: Stand by, Wally.
170:50:45 Schirra: We aren't scheduled to use it tonight, anyway, but they can just go ahead and think on that one for a while.
Comm break.
170:51:57 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
170:51:59 Schirra: Go.
170:52:01 Swigert: Wally, we are expecting to chlorinate tonight since we didn't do it last night, but relative to the brown spot, we are trying to get more data on that to pass up to you. [Pause]
170:52:13 Schirra: I checked my log - I think I did last night, and that's where we got the brown spot. [Pause]
170:52:22 Cunningham: Yes, last night we did chlorinate. [Pause]
170:52:29 Swigert: Say again, Walt.
170:52:30 Schirra: We chlorinated last night at 150 hours, approximately.
170:52:35 Swigert: Okay. [Pause]
170:52:41 Schirra: We're giving you a lot of lead time on the problem.
170:52:44 Swigert: Roger. Thank you.
170:52:46 Schirra: You can check with any other country you'd like. [Long pause]
170:53:06 Swigert: Okay. Wally, we concur with your chlorination; we won't chlorinate tonight.
170:53:11 Schirra: Roger. You just might play games with one of those injectors and see what the heck is down there.
170:53:17 Swigert: Good idea.
170:53:18 Schirra: It's betwee_nthe injector and the deal that hooks up with the spacecraft; there's a pin in it. [Pause]
170:53:26 Swigert: Okay.
170:53:28 Schirra: I change it. The place where the small end of the chlorine ampule is pierced; that's where the brown stuff collects. [Pause]
170:53:38 Swigert: Roger. Copy that.
170:53:40 Schirra: Very good.
170:53:42 Cunningham: We've got almost 48 hours; we are at 24 hours, now.
Comm break.
Apollo Control here. Watching this data coming in from Guam, you heard Walt Cunningham acknowledge that he was reassured that we were showing a heartbeat for him - and the heartbeat is about 68, the mean heart rate is about 68.
170:54:58 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
170:55:00 Cunningham: Go ahead, Jack.
170:55:02 Swigert: Walt, sometime at your convenience, we would like a command module RCS temp readout.
170:55:07 Cunningham: Roger. I'll get that shortly. [Long pause]
170:55:20 Swigert: Apollo 7, opposite omni. [Pause]
170:55:28 Cunningham: Roger. We are ready now.
170:55:32 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
170:55:52 Cunningham: Okay. 5A - 5C 5 volts, 5D 5 volts, 6D 5 volts, 6C 5 volts, 6 Baker 5 - wait - 6 Baker 5 volts, 6 Able 5 volts. [Pause]
170:56:14 Swigert: Roger. Copy those, Walt.
170:56:18 Schirra: Jack, what's the cutoff on this cold soak test? Have we reached it yet? [Pause]
170:56:26 Swigert: Wally, it's about 171 10. [Pause]
170:56:31 Schirra: Okay. That's the same cutoff we had - it was started later than original. [Pause]
170:56:42 Swigert: Okay. There's a correction, Wally. It's 171 plus 22 because we started late.
170:56:47 Schirra: Okay.
Long comm break.
And that will wrap up the communication by Guam at 170 hours, 57 minutes.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, 171 hours, 05 minutes into the flight. Momentarily we should acquire through Hawaii. There goes the first call.
HAWAII (REV 108)
171:05:10 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
171:05:16 Schirra: We report all quiet here.
171:05:18 Swigert: Roger. Donn, when you go to power down today, just as a reminder, don't forget to deactivate that DAP. [Pause]
171:05:33 Schirra: Got that. We've got Donn on the rack, and we know how to do that stuff.
171:05:39 Swigert: Roger. We were just worried about a jet fire.
171:05:42 Schirra: Roger. The number 1 window is now collecting condensation on the lower edge, the edge nearest the grid cell. There's some large specks as long as three-eighths of an inch and about an eight of an inch wide on it. Most of the specks are about a thirty-second of an inch in diameter; a lot of dust collection on the outer surface of the inner pane and the condensates on the inner surface of the outer pane. The little specks are from the dump system on the outer surface of the outer pane. Number 2 window has the sun on it now, and the smoke effect I don't think has increased any, but as we originally reported, that's probably from tower jettison. Guess the window looks quite good. Number 3 window, the hatch window, collected so much condensates, it's almost smoothed over. There is a circle about 2 and 1/2 inches in diameter that has the same crystal structure; this is all collected on the inner surface of the outer pane. That's a very bad show on that window. Number 4 window is about the same as number 2; and number 5 window, the side window, is also collecting condensate on the inner surface of the outer pane but does not have the dump particles collecting on it. [Pause]
171:07:15 Swigert: Okay. Wally, that was a real fine window status. [Pause]
171:07:30 Schirra: We've written in our log that beards are no good. Did you copy that? [Pause]
171:07:43 Swigert: Say again, Wally.
171:07:45 Schirra: We'ye entered in our logs that beards are no good.
171:07:54 Swigert: I couldn't read it.
171:07:57 Schirra: We wrote in our log - our flight plan log - that facial beards are no good.
171:08:04 Swigert: I copied that. [Long pause]
171:08:32 Schirra: At 7, we're 21 hours and 22 minutes - we might as well start you boys cracking, on figuring how much fuel we have left, and I'll get our DELTA for these two DTO's. [Pause]
171:08:44 Swigert: Okay. Wally, in work.
171:08:46 Schirra: Roger. And we noticed a gross change in temperature; it looks like it's going up.
171:08:54 Swigert: We concur.
171:08:56 Cunningham: The SPS propellant tank temperature is now reading 68.
171:09:00 Swigert: Roger.
171:09:03 Cunningham: Jack, how about a hydrogen 1 quantity and hydrogen 2 quantity? [Pause]
171:09:13 Swigert: Okay. Walt, the hydrogen, 39.0, 37.2. [Pause]
171:09:23 Cunningham: Roger. Pitch rate [garble] thank that kept up. [Pause]
171:09:31 Cunningham: We estimate 4 more days.
171:09:35 Swigert: I couldn't read that, 7.
171:09:37 Cunningham: We estimate 4 more days [garble]. [Pause]
171:09:47 Swigert: Roger. Copy that.
171:09:49 Swigert: Hey, Wally, a couple of quick questions on the FTI problem that you had back: did the FTI flip occur with the ORDEAL and GDO operating on ball number 1? [Long pause]
The flight plan indicates the crew should be now powering down the guidance and navigation system, they'll also power down the spacecraft into the control system, stabilization and control system. The next item at 171 hours and 30 minutes calls for a purge - an oxygen purge of the fuel cells. We're going through the noisy area of the ship Huntsville at this point. Guaymas should pick up momentarily. And the guidance and navigation order happily reports that we're ten feet above our red line in the quad area on propellant. Let's listen some more as we move down off the west coast of Mexico through the Guaymas circle.
HUNTSVILLE (REV 108)
171:10:18 Schirra: [Garble] you now? [Garble], and we'll see how long it lasts. [Pause]
171:10:24 Swigert: Okay. Wally, your answer started just at the handover to the Huntsville. Could you say again?
171:10:31 Schirra: We have our GDC on ball 1. We're doing a leak.
171:10:37 Swigert: Was ORDEAL and GDC operating at the same time on ball number 1?

171:17:24 Schirra: Loud and clear.
171:17:25 Swigert: Roger. Wally, here is a chart value for your RCS fuel.
171:17:31 Schirra: Go ahead.
171:17:33 Swigert: Roger. 614 quad A is still the limiting quad, but still above all RCS redlines.
171:17:42 Schirra: Very good.
171:17:45 Swigert: And, Walt, could you give us a batt C readout when you have a minute? [Pause]
171:17:53 Cunningham: 36.2.
171:17:55 Swigert: Roger. Copy. And your hydrogen imbalance is improving new. We've gone from 3.4 to 1.8 difference. [Pause]
171:18:06 Cunningham: Roger. [Pause]
171:18:15 Swigert: Wally, I missed some of the answers to the question I asked about the FDAI problem you had. Did this 180 degree flip occur when the ORDEAL and the GDC were on ball number 1? [Pause]
171:18:29 Schirra: Negative. I've now got a [garble]. You've got FTI [garble] on ball number 1. I'll give it [garble] ball number 1. Here it comes, GDC. Do you read?
171:18:41 Swigert: We aren't getting the data right now, Wally.
171:18:42 Schirra (onboard): You are or are not?
171:18:44 Schirra: You're not?
171:18:46 Swigert: Negative.
171:18:47 Schirra (onboard): No data?
171:18:48 Swigert: We've got a low antenna angle here at Guaymas.
171:18:51 Schirra: Oh. I'll hold off here a second. [Long pause]
171:19:11 Swigert: Okay. Wally, it doesn't look like we are going to get any data at all here at Guaymas because of the keyhole. [Pause]
171:19:15 Schirra (onboard): Okay, I'll give you the [garble] on this thing [garble].
171:19:20 Schirra: I've got about a 172 pitch, slipping to an FTI on number 1, and the ball slips right over to 022 pitch, so I can't seem to get GDC to lock on ball number 1. [Long pause]
171:19:40 Swigert: Okay.
171:19:42 Schirra: But it's fine on number 2.
171:19:44 Swigert: Does this flip occur just at the time that you're switching GDC to ball number 1?
171:19:51 Schirra: That's correct.
171:19:52 Swigert: Okay. Copy.
171:19:54 Schirra: All this is clocked now. Do you want the data, Jack?
171:20:00 Swigert: Okay. We're just about, to lose you at Guaymas; we'll pick you up at Tananarive at 56. [Pause]
171:20:06 Schirra: Roger.
Very long comm break.
And that will wrap up the conversation for the Guaymas pass. At 171 hours, 20 minutes into the flight this is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 171 hours, 56 minutes. Tananarive should acquire momentarily and we will get an update for - a planned landing area update. No other activity is scheduled. Actually, that update may come later, during the Hawaiian crossing. More than likely, just a check in and a stand by call, as the spacecraft and the Control Center are sort of powering down after the day's work. We will keep the line open and see what develops.
TANANARIVE (REV 109)
171:57:37 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. [Long pause]
171:57:40 Cunningham (onboard): Roger, Jack.
171:58:00 Swigert: Tananarive M&O, Houston CAPCOM. [Pause]
171:58:10 Communications Technician: Houston CAPCOM, Tananarive M&O.
171:58:15 Swigert: Roger. Are we going out down there?
171:58:20 Communications Technician: Affirmative, you are.
171:58:25 Swigert: Thank you, sir.
Long comm break.
Well, from all appearances, we are not going to put any calls into the spacecraft, so we will just take down the line. At 171 hours, 59 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
172:06:44 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Tananarive; Mercury at 172 plus 21.
Very long comm break.
172:06:51 Schirra (onboard): Roger, Jack. Do you read?
This is Apollo Control, at 172 hours, 22 minutes into the flight. By the ship Mercury, in the far west Pacific, we have just acquired the spacecraft.
MERCURY (REV 109)
172:21:30 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury.
172:21:36 Schirra: Roger, Jack.
172:21:38 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, I would like to get a flight plan update when they plan, on activate the primary water boiler and for how long.
172:21:47 Swigert: Okay, Walt, in work. And, Walt, here are some redlines I used on your RCS that you might be interested in. [Pause]
172:21:58 Cunningham: What are they on, Jack? Redlines for what?
172:22:06 Swigert: Your RCS redlines. In SCS deorbit, we'll use 558 pounds as the redline. Your DAP redline is 487, and your hubrid redline is 252. [Pause]
172:22:24 Cunningham: Thank you.

GUAM (REV 109)
172:24:08 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7. Over.
172:24:11 Swigert: Go ahead, Apollo 7.
172:24:13 Cunningham: Okay. I'd like to give you a status report of the remaining film we have on board.
172:24:19 Swigert: Okay. Go ahead.
172:24:21 Cunningham: First, the 70mm Pan-X: we have 121 frames remaining; S0368, 20 frames; S0121, 48 frames. For the 16mm on the 368, there is 2 and 1/3 magazines; on the 168, there is four magazines. Over. [Pause]
172:24:53 Swigert: Copy that, Walt. [Long pause]
172:25:10 Cunningham: I am standing by for - [Pause]
172:25:20 Swigert: We'll be back with you in a minute on that primary evap.

HAWAII (REV 109)
172:40:43 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
172:40:46 Cunningham: Roger, Jack.
172:40:48 Swigert: Roger. Walt, I have your Block data number 19. [Long pause]
172:41:32 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read? [Pause]
172:41:36 Swigert: Roger, 7. We've got your block data. Are you ready to copy?
172:41:40 Cunningham: Ready to copy. Go. I'm loaded with blocks now.
172:41:44 Swigert: Roger. 111 dash 3 Alfa plus 295 plus 1389 175 plus 17 plus 19 2808, 112 dash Charlie plus 195 plus 1520 177 plus 00 plus 44 2680, 113 dash Alfa Charlie minus 025 minus 0090 177 plus 42 plus 42 5628, 114 dash Alfa Charlie plus 025 minus 0239 170 plus 14 plus 47 5297, 115 dash Alfa Charlie plus 122 minus 0310 180 plus 48 plus 41 4637, 116 dash 2 Alfa plus 243 minus 0269 182 plus 26 plus 21 3648. End.
172:44:31 Cunningham: Forgot 164. Okay. Readback follows: 111 dash 3 Alfa plus 295 plus 1389 175 plus 17 plus 19 2808, 112 dash 3 Charlie plus 195 plus 1520 177 plus 00 plus 44 2680, 113 dash Alfa Charlie minus 025 minus 0090 177 plus 42 plus 42 5628, 114 dash Alfa Charlie plus 025 minus 0239 179 plus 14 plus 47 5297, 115 dash Alfa Charlie 122 minus 0310 180 plus 48 plus 41 4637, 116 dash 2 Alfa plus 243 minus 0269 182 plus 26 plus 21 3648. Over.
172:45:39 Swigert: Roger. On the second block, Walt, that's 112 dash Charlie Charlie. [Pause]
172:45:50 Cunningham: Roger. 112 dash Charlie Charlie, and tell John Llewellyn that I'we got a whole book full of unused block here now.
172:45:59 Swigert: Copy that. Okay. [Long pause]
HUNTSVILLE (REV 109)
172:46:26 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
172:46:30 Cunningham: Go ahead, Jack.
172:46:33 Swigert: Okay. Walt, you're pretty weak, but on your question on the primary evaporator: we would like to return the primary evaporator to AUTO.
172:46:44 Cunningham: Going to AUTO now. Shall I bring it into operation as we've been doing before? I'll go ahead and bring it on the line as we have been. [Pause]
172:47:18 Swigert: Okay. Walt, if you'll just place that prtmry evaporator on AUTO, it'll cycle by itself, and we're expecting a cycle sometime tonight. [Pause]
172:47:30 Cunningham: Well, it's liable to also dry up again sometime tonight. If that's okay with you, I can go ahead and bring it on down, but okay going to AUTO.
172:47:40 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
172:47:45 Swigert: And, Walt, we've been doing some discussion down here on a possible manual reservicing procedure for the secondary evaporator in the event it dries out. We've run some tests and have come up with a procedure if you want to copy it.
172:48:05 Cunningham: Is this something that somebody's dreamed up after all these months? I've been told that you cannot reservice the secondary evaporator.
172:48:13 Swigert: That is correct, and we've come up with a procedure to do it. [Pause]
172:48:19 Cunningham: I don't know how everybody gets so smart in one week's time, but I'll go ahead and copy it. How long is it?
172:48:24 Swigert: Oh, four steps.
172:48:26 Cunningham: Very long steps?
172:48:28 Swigert: No, real short.
172:48:30 Cunningham: Hit me with it.
172:48:32 Swigert: Okay. You want to turn the evaporator water control switch secondary to AUTO. [Pause]
172:48:41 Cunningham: That's where it is aniway, isn't it?
172:48:43 Swigert: Roger. Then you want to turn your secondary coolant loop EVAP switch to EVAP for 5 plus or minus 1 seconds, then RESET for 10 plus or minus 1 seconds. [Long pause]
172:49:31 Swigert: Roger. You copy that, Walt?
172:49:34 Cunningham: I got evaporator water control secondary to AUTO which is where it normally is when it's running. Go to the EVAP position for 5 seconds and RESET for 10 seconds - I assume immediately afterwards, is that correct?
172:49:46 Swigert: Affirmative. 5 plus or minus 1 seconds, then RESET for plus or minus 1 second. Okay. Then repeat this - this step above for 40 - for a recommended 40 cycles. [Pause]
172:50:00 Cunningham: Forty times I do that, right?
172:50:02 Swigert: Roger. Forty cycles is the desired, but 20 cycles is the minimum number needed to bring the evaporator on the line. It'll give you three-tenths of a pound, 20 cycles will. [Pause]
172:50:16 Cunningham: Okay. But I'd just like to go on record here as saying that people that dream up procedures like this after you lift off have somehow or another been dropping the ball for the last 3 years if they have a procedure where you can reservice. It looks kind of Mickey Mouse, but I'll stand by to do it if I have to. [Pause]
172:50:34 Cunningham (onboard): I've got the second step repeated for 40 cycles if necessary?
172:50:36 Swigert: Okay. We just wanted to get you thinking about it in case you needed it. [Pause]
172:50:43 Cunningham: What? Did you read me then?
172:50:45 Swigert: Affirmative, Walt.
172:50:46 Cunningham: Okey. I'll do this Mickey Mouse procedure if necessary, but not until LOS. We'll be sayin a lot further in the flight plan. [Pause]
172:50:54 Swigert: Okay. We've got it. We're about to lose you over the Huntsville, Walt. We'll pick you up at Tananarive at 32, 173 plus 32.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo control at 172 hours, 51 minutes and we'll bid good-bye to Apollo 7 for the afternoon.
This is Apollo Control at 173 hours, 09 minutes. We're still about 23 minutes from our next acquisition of the spacecraft at the Tananarive tracking station. At the present time here in the Mission Control Center we are in the midst of a change of shift. Flight Director Gene Kranz will be coming with his white team to replace Flight Director Glenn Lunney and the black team and we anticipate that Ron Evans will be coming on shortly as CapCom to replace Jack Swigert at 273 [should be 173] hours, 09 minutes. This is Apollo Control.

174:00:14 Swigert: Roger. You might tell Walt that his spark plug changer has some information here when he gets a chance to troubleshoot his BIOMED. [Pause]
174:00:24 Schirra: Roger. He's got a good chance because he's got his hood open now. [Pause]
174:00:34 Swigert: Roger. We'd like to confirm that the yellow lead is connected to the blue signal conditioner at this time. [Pause]
174:00:43 Schirra: Okay. It's not hooked up right now. Yellow lead to blue conditioner. And Donn Eisele has the same break I have. It's identical. [Pause]
174:00:57 Swigert: Roger.
174:00:58 Schirra: So he'll rig it up the same way I am.
174:01:03 Swigert: That's fine. [Pause]
174:01:14 Swigert: If Walt has the yellow lead to the blue conditioner, we would like to disconnect the side sensors at the pin connectors and then connect the yellow lead to the upper and lower chest sensors. [Pause]
174:01:33 Schirra: Okay. And I just disconnect the [garble] or whatever the heck they are - auxiliary.
174:01:39 Swigert: That's affirmative; disconnect the auxiliary.
174:01:42 Schirra: Okay. I'll have him remove those sensors then as long as he is going to disconnect them.
174:01:45 Swigert: Affirmative. And he can also ...
174:01:46 Schirra: Just keep the two externals and run them to the yellow pin to the blue conditioner.
174:01:52 Swigert: That's affirmative; yes.
174:01:54 Schirra: Okay. Will do. We're changing our skivvies tonight.

This is Apollo control at 174 hours, 08 minutes into the mission, during our press briefing the spacecraft completed two passes, one over the Tananarive station and we've just completed a pass over the tracking ship Mercury. We had no communications with the spacecraft over Tananarive, we put in a call to the crew and stood by, there was no conversation there, there was a brief bit of conversation over the Mercury and we passed up some information to Wally Schirra on reconnecting some biomedical instrumentation leads which probably have come undone and we'll play the Mercury pass back for you now in its entirety.
That is all the communication we had with the crew over the tracking ship Mercury we'll be acquiring again at Hawaii in about 5 minutes. This is Apollo Control at 174 hours, 12 minutes into the flight.

174:17:04 Schirra: That's affirmative.
174:17:06 Evans: Roger. And which suit circuit accumulator is now in operation? [Pause]
174:17:17 Schirra: Number 1 - wait a minite; stand by. Number 1, yes. [Pause]
174:17:24 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
174:17:43 Schirra: We'll leave that urine dump heater where it is; it's been working like a charm.
174:17:50 Evans: Roger. It kind of bounces up and down here on the temperature, and we're just watching it; we're curious which one has been working.
174:17:58 Schirra: A only.
174:17:59 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
174:18:34 Schirra: Any new news back that way? [Pause]

174:20:58 Evans: Roger. We're looking at it. [Long pause]
174:21:26 Schirra: Ron, ask Sir John if we can move the upper sternal down about an inch to relieve the strain on the lead. [Pause]
174:21:33 Evans: That's affirmative.
174:21:35 Schirra: Okay. What's the reading we're sending you, then?
174:21:37 Evans: Roger. It's not looking very good yet. We'll check it again at Ascension.
174:21:42 Schirra: Okay. That's the two sternal leads on the yellow pin connector to the blue signal conditioner. [Pause]

175:39:58 Evans: About 1 minute LOS; Redstone at 05. [Long pause]
175:40:30 Eisele: Hey, Ron, you got any hot news for us?
175:40:33 Evans: Roger. The paper said your SPS burn was the mightiest maneuver ever made by a manned spacecraft.
175:40:40 Eisele: That's right.
175:40:42 Evans: Yes. The stock market is at its highest level since February of '66.
Very long comm break.
175:40:54 Eisele (onboard): Outstanding.
And with that we appear to have lost communcations with Apollo 7, we're scheduled to reacquire the spacecraft in about 23 minutes over the tracking ship Redstone in the south Pacific. You heard Donn Eisele report on the status of the crew at the present time continuing to keep up on the water intake and the lunar module pilot Walt Cunningham and Wally Schirra, commander have apparently changed into their back up pairs of constant wear garments or Wally called them him back up up backs. This is Apollo control at 175 hours, 42 minutes.
This is Apollo Control at 176 hours, and 6 minutes into the mission. We're preparing to contact the spacecraft at this time over the tracking Ship Redstone in the South Pacific. Over that - over our last pass over the tracking ship Mercury telemetry information showed that our orbit has presently 245.1 nautical miles for a high point with a perigee of 89.8 nautical miles. We'll listen now as CAPCOM, Ron Evans, prepares to put in a call to the crew.

176:06:32 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone.
176:06:35 Eisele: Roger, Houston.
176:06:37 Evans: Roger. Loud and clear. Say, Donn, on all of our discussion on the DELTA-V meter there today, your EMS counter, we never did get a residual EMS DELTA-V after the burn today. Do yon happen to recall what that was?
176:07:02 Eisele: I'm sorry. Sure don't, Ron. We couldn't see it very well; it was so bright in here that those numerics didn't show up very well. [Pause]
176:07:13 Evans: Roger.
Comm break.
176:08:44 Eisele: Hey, Ron. Could yon give me an orbital backup date please and also find out how much difference the period is between our orbit and the one that was portrayed on our orbit map?

176:12:01 Eisele: Okay. 175 plus 15 plus zeroes and than 414 east?
176:12:07 Evans: Affirmative. 41.48 east.
176:12:08 Eisele: Okay. Did you find out about the orbit period? [Pause]
176:12:19 Evans: Roger. We're working on it. The period is 90 something - let me look it up here - the period is 90 plus 42 now. [Pause]
176:12:34 Eisele: Period is 90 plus 22.
176:12:37 Evans: Affirmative.
176:12:39 Eisele: I see. I don't know what it is on this map. I guess I can figure it out. [Pause]
176:12:48 Evans: We'll get the information for you. And, Donn, dad you get the fix on the BIOMED harness that we passed up for the rest of the guys?
176:12:58 Eisele: Oh, yes. To switch the plug to the other side.
176:13:02 Evans: Affirmative.
176:13:04 Eisele: Yes. I did get that; I haven't done it yet. I will in a little bit.

176:32:48 Evans: Say it again, Donn.
176:32:52 Eisele: How's the weather there?
176:32:57 Evans: Roger. The weather is beautiful.
176:33:01 Eisele: I just looked outside. There's a beautiful planet up here over Scorpio. I don't know which one it ts, but it sure is bright.
176:33:11 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
176:33:16 Eisele: May be Jupiter. [Pause]
176:33:26 Evans: We'll check and let you know. [Pause]

176:38:16 Evans: Houston. Go.
176:38:18 Eisele: Roger. A couple of days ago we did a P23 starto-lunar landmark exercise. I just wonder if the data got down to the ground and if they were happy with it? We only got a chance to do one or two, and I didn't know how they came out.
176:38:36 Evans: Roger. We'll check it.
176:38:39 Eisele: Thank you. [Long pause]
176:39:11 Flight: Ron, we were going to get the SCS and G&N control mode checks, and. Donn's awake now. We've got a couple of minutes. It might be worthwhile to try and get that one done. Find out what he has completed from his log. [Pause]
176:39:32 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston.
176:39:36 Eisele: Go.
176:39:37 Evans: Roger. Have you had a ...
176:39:38 Eisele: Go ahead, Ron.
176:39:39 Evans: Have you had a chance to give us a rundown on the SCS and G&N control modes, how many you have completed? [Pause]
176:39:48 Eisele: Yes; stand by. That's right. I owe you that from yesterday.
176:39:51 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]

176:45:14 Schirra (onboard): (Sneeze) 176 hours, 45 minutes; this water gun is still spitting air at us.
This is Mission Control. We've lost contact, now, with the spacecraft over Ascension. A relatively long pass that time accounted for by the fact Apollo 7 is at it's, or near it's apogee of 240 nautical miles at this point. The next station to acquire will be the tracking ship Mercury, and we'll pick up there in about 28 minutes. The thank you that you heard passed up from the Control Center to Donn Eisele from the medics here, was in response to his successful repair of his biomedical instrumentation leads. We are now getting a good electrocardiogram data on Donn here in the control center. At 176 hours, 43 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 177 hours, 10 minutes. We've just acquired the spacecraft over the tracking ship Mercury. We'll listen for the call.
MERCURY (REV 112)
177:10:04 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston, Mercury. Standing by.
177:10:10 Eisele: Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
177:10:13 Evans: Roger. Loud and clear. [Long pause]
177:10:34 Eisele: Ron, I'm looking over this scorecard here on attitude control modes, and we've got them all checked off except for some of the various rates, particularly the high rates in automatic maneuver for G&N. [Pause]
177:10:54 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
177:10:58 Eisele: If you like, I can go down the list for you. You want the details, or you just want a total scorecard?
177:11:06 Evans: If you have time, we would like to go down the list. We're trying to figure out how much RCS fuel we need to allocate for the rest of them. [Pause]
177:11:15 Eisele: Okay. Go down G&N control modes. Wally has checked off - or one of us did - MAX deadband attitude holds for 20 to 30 minutes. I believe we did that in possibly during P20 rendezvous. Also, the minimum deadband we used during SPS burns which is attitude hold G&N. [Pause]
177:11:41 Evans: Roger.
177:11:43 Eisele: Automatic maneuvers; we do those. We do an automatic trend maneuver for every burn. It also took automatic maneuvers in P20 during rendezvous.
177:11:53 Evans: Roger.
177:11:55 Eisele: Manual rate commands have been used to trim the roll angles at, you know, just prior to the last AUTO trend for a burn, and we may have used it at other places. I can't recall offhand. I think we did during such things as that P23 tracking where we went to attitude hold for a little while and then DAP. [Pause]
177:12:18 Evans: Roger.
177:12:19 Eisele: We used the minimum impulse controller for that - the sextant calibration and for P23. We used RCS translation control for the rendezvous, and it was a TPI burn. We used a CMC free mode in free axis during the sextant calibration. We made automatic maneuvers at 0.5 and 0.2 degrees per second. We've also made manual maneuver at those rates. Usually, it takes place during the preburn cycle, say 5 to 10 minutes before the burn when we're maneuvering the attitude or holding attitude. [Pause]
177:13:01 Evans: Roger.
177:13:03 Eisele: Okay. On the SPS: during the SPS cold soak we, of course, did the MAX deadband, that was the 4-degree deadband with low rates. We used minimum deadband low rate during rendezvous for attitude hold during braking and line of sight corrections. We used RATE COMMAND at low rate during the same period of time for during rendezvous. We used minimum impulse and ACCEL COMMAND right along. That's our standard maneuver modes; it's of this - it's higher than any other rate. Translation control: we've done that through one SPS burn and for the initial separation maneuver from the S-IVB. Wally, just before we powered down last night, set the manual to RET mode and said it was satisfactory. We have not done RATE COMMAND HIGH rate, but we'll do so during maneuvers to entry altitude following separation. We also used the maximum deadband 8 degree during the SPS cold soak. And he's got here "minimum deadband high rate during SPS cold soak." [Pause]
177:14:19 Evans: Roger. Looks good, then.
177:14:23 Eisele: I don't know what all they need to know in way of data down there, but as far as we're concerned, we've run it out pretty thoroughly, and very pleased with the various modes, as far as handling qualities. Wally could tell you some more on those, too. We're a little curious as to the fuel consumption on some of them. I think some modes - particularly with the kind of deadband, they're using a little more than we thought they might based on our simulations before we flew. [Long pause]
177:14:54 Evans: Roger.
Long comm break.
This is Mission Control, We're about on the fringe of coverage from the Mercury. However, we do have overlapping coverage from Guam on this pass, and we'll continue to monitor.

This is Apollo Control at 177 hours, 22 minutes, and we've had loss of signal with the spacecraft from Guam.
This is Mission Control, Houston at 177 hours, 40 minutes into the flight of Apollo 7. The mission is progressing very well, almost without incident at this time. Wally Schirra, and Walter Cunningham began their scheduled 8 hours sleep periods about two hours ago. In the meantime we have been maintaining contact with the spacecraft through our tracking sites with Command Module Pilot, Donn Eisele. Donn ended his 8 hours sleep period about the same time his two fellow crewmen began theirs. Apollo 7 is currently in orbit with a high point of about 243 nautical miles, and a low point of about 90 nautical miles. Following that very successful burn earlier today with the 21,000 pound thrust spacecraft Service Propulsion System engine. The SPS engine is scheduled to be ignited three more times including a burn to bring the spacecraft back to Earth Tuesday. At present time Apollo 7 spacecraft is approaching acquisition over the Redstone in the South Pacific. We'll stand by for CAPCOM Ron Evans to put in a call to Eisele.

This is Apollo Control at 177 hours, 51 minutes and we've just had loss of signal from the spacecraft over the Redstone. As you heard that time, Donn Eisele confirmed CAPCOM Ron Evans' suspicion that he was doing his exercises at this time. That was indicated by the biomedical scope here in the Control Center, now showing Donn's heart rate going up somewhat. Eisele joked the other night that the only time he had a chance to use the inflight exerciser was when his two fellow crewmen were asleep. We'll be picking up the spacecraft again over Ascension. Acquisition there is scheduled at 178 hours, 7 minutes, or about 17 minutes from now. This is Apollo Control, Houston.

I was wondering if it would be all right to do it earlier; they don't have much going on today except this secondary coolant test.
179:48:06 Evans: I see. What you're sayng is you like to be on TV.
179:48:10 Eisele: No, I don't care to be on TV, but I don't care to have those guys walking around while I'm trying to sleep either.
179:48:15 Evans: No, we'll check into it and let you know later.
179:48:18 Eisele: I think what it is, they're trying to set this up so it ties in with somebody's TV show. Seems to me you could move it back or move it ahead an hour or two and then tape it, or do you want to do that?
179:48:34 Evans: I don't know about that; I will check into it. [Pause]
179:48:42 Eisele: That's kind of an awkward time for us because that's when we're usually changing shifts and so forth. [Pause]
179:48:53 Evans: Roger. 'We'll take a look at it; I think it may have something to do with that secondary loop test.
179:49:01 Eisele: I believe you're right. The secondary loop test will still go along all right while that's going on. Start to check into it anyway and see what they say.
179:49:14 Evans: Will do.
179:49:16 Eisele: Thank you.
Long comm break.
This is Mission Control we've lost acquistion now from Ascension but because of the fact that the spacecraft is in a higher orbit and at the present time is near apogee of 240 nautical miles we have overlapping coverage from the Canary Islands. We'll continue to stand by.
CANARY (REV 114)
179:53:04 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Thirty seconds LOS; Guam at 28.
179:53:09 Eisele: Roger. Guam at 28.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 180 hours, 29 minutes. The spacecraft is presently coming within range of the station at Guam. This will be low elevation pass and relatively brief. At the present time, Wally Schirra and Walt Cunningham are about 5 hours into their scheduled 8 hours sleep period. And the spacecraf, is midway through day side pass. We've just put in a call to Donn Eisele onboard the spacecraft. We'll stand by for any conversation.

180:28:56 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston through Guam. [Long pause]
180:29:50 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston.
180:29:54 Eisele: Roger. Go.
180:29:56 Evans: Roger. Donn, look, like we're going to move the TV one orbit before. I can change your times if you're ready to copy. [Pause]
180:30:06 Eisele (onboard): Okay. Stand by.
180:30:08 Eisele: Go ahead. [Pause]
180:30:15 Evans: 7, Houston. Did you say go ahead?
180:30:18 Eisele (onboard): Right.
180:30:25 Evans: 7, 30 seconds LOS. I'll catch you at Redstone at 52. [Pause]
180:30:37 Eisele: Okay. Fine. I'll talk to you then.
Very long comm break.
180:31:10 Eisele (onboard): 180 hours, 30 minutes...
180:31:35 Eisele (onboard): 180 hours, 30 minutes; one of the sensors on the BIOMED harness is heating up, getting too warm, and I've got to take the whole rig off until I find out what the problem is. It's getting a hit warm like it is.
This is Mission Control. We have lost the signal of the spacecraft now from Guam. And we'll be reacquiring over the tracking ship Redstone in about 20 minutes from now. As you heard Cap Com Ron Evans attempted to pass up to Donn Eisele onboard the spacecraft an updated time on the television pass for tomorrow. He said we would be doing it one revolution earlier. According to our first calculations that would put it at about 7:15 tomorrow morning. We will update that time and refine a little more as necessary. At 180 hours, 32 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo control at 180 hours, 52 minutes into the mission, we'll have acquisition of the spacecraft over the tracking ship Redstone shortly, we'll stand by for Capcom Ron Evans to put in a call to the crew.
REDSTONE (REV 114)
180:52:30 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston, Redstone.
180:52:34 Schirra: Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
180:52:37 Evans: Roger. I have block data number 20 and some flight plan updates.
180:52:43 Eisele: Okay. Before that, I've got a little problem here with my BIOMED. One of the signal conditioners here is getting quite hot, so I took the whole rig off and stowed it. I just thought I better pass that along and see if the Flight Surgeon has got any ideas on what he wants me to do.
180:53:00 Evans: Roger. Which one got hot, your black one or the blue one?
180:53:06 Eisele: I don't know much about them; the one on the right - the farthest to the right. [Pause]
180:53:18 Evans: Roger - [Long pause]
180:53:38 Evans: Roger. Donn, the one farthest to the right is the power supply.
180:53:44 Eisele: Roger. I don't care which one it is. I'm not going to wear it anymore.
180:53:50 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
180:54:01 Eisele: Sounds like I triggered the [garble] notwithstanding all the sweet talk we got about how there weren't any. [Pause]
180:54:11 Evans: I understand. [Pause]
180:54:17 Eisele: Roger.
180:54:20 Eisele: Okay. I'll get this format. And we'll go over the update. Why don't you give me that flight plan part first on the TV?
180:54:25 Evans: Okay. Everything's the same if you'll check your emergency key test. [Pause]
180:54:33 Evans: We'll do it on ...
180:54:35 Eisele: Say again.
180:54:36 Evans: On the emergency key test.
180:54:38 Eisele: Yes.
180:54:40 Evans: We'll do it at 190 plus 35.
180:54:45 Eisele: Okay.
180:54:47 Evans: Prepare TV at 188 plus 00. TV turnon at 189 plus 02. TV pass 189 plus 04 to 189 plus 15. [Pause]
180:55:34 Eisele: Okay. I got TV ON at 189 02, TV pass from 04 to 15, and you moved the USB key emergency key test over to 190 35.
180:55:47 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
180:56:03 Eisele: Okay. [Pause]
180:56:10 Evans: Now I have block data when you're ready to copy. [Pause]
180:56:18 Eisele: Go ahead with the block data, Ron.

180:59:58 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Readback correct.
181:00:09 Eisele: Ron, I've got one other flight plan question for you.
181:00:11 Evans: Roger. Go.
181:00:13 Eisele: Roger. In our checlist, there's a procedure called the GEC and/or IMU backup alignment, and it's identically the same procedure for either or both preferences. I noticed in the flight plan we've got two separate tests there which apparently are the same thing. I wonder if you could clarify that? There's one on 262 and one on 273.
181:00:40 Evans: Roger. We'll investigate and advise.
181:00:44 Eisele: Okay.
181:00:46 Evans: And on your P23, we have good data. We will be ansessing it tomorrow and let you know.
181:00:54 Eisele: You say you did get good data?
181:00:56 Evans: Affirmative.
181:00:57 Eisele: Well, fine.

This is Mission Control the spacecraft is now going out of range Of the tracking ship Redstone. We'll be reacquiring at the Canary site in about 20 minutes. During that pass we passed an update to Eisele on a television pass for tomorrow of the new time for acquisition at the Corpus Christi site and the beginning of the television transmission from the spacecraft is now 189 hours, 4 minutes ground elapsed time and we compute that to be about 7:07 AM, Houston time tomorrow. Eisele also advised that the signal conditioner power supply in his biomedical harness was apparently heating up, he said he had taken it off and stowed it. At 181 hours, 4 minutes into the flight this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control; 181 hours, 23 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We're anticipating acquisition at Canary Islands in a very few seconds; let's listen in.

181:32:01 Evans: 7, Houston. My mistake. Honeysuckle is not up this pass; it will be Redstone at 27.
181:32:07 Eisele: Okay. Redstone, 27. Look for you then. [Pause]
181:32:13 Evans: Roger. We're going to be in quandry in the morning. You're supposed to pass right over Houston at the same time you're shooting down the TV pictures, so we'll probably look at the TV instead of look for the spacecraft. [Pause]
181:32:22 Eisele (onboard): (Laughter) Okay. Take your choice.
181:32:24 Eisele: [Garble] get a portable you could watch it outside.

182:30:46 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. I have a T zero time for your secondary coolant loop test. [Pause]
182:30:57 Eisele: Say again, Bill, pleese.
182:30:59 Pogue: I have the update time for the secondary coolant loop test.
182:31:04 Eisele: Okay. Start time for the test, you mean?
182:31:06 Pogue: Roger.
182:31:08 Eisele: Okay. Go ahead.
182:31:09 Pogue: It's 183 plus 40. [Pause]
182:31:21 Eisele: Roger. 183 plus 40.
182:31:24 Pogue: Right, and I've also been reminded to pass on - they said you probably already knew, but that duty cycle entries on the procedure are not appropriate; they're not applicable.
182:31:36 Eisele: Understand. The duty cycle entries are not appropriate.
182:31:39 Pogue: Affirmative.
182:31:40 Eisele: Walt says he hopes scmebody down there hawkeyes the radiator parameters on - keeping an eye on how they are doing. [Pause]
182:31:48 Pogue: Right. [Long pause]
182:32:04 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7.
182:32:06 Pogue: Go.
182:32:07 Eisele: Roger. We desided to start calling this thing the emergency coolant loop rather than secondary, so from now on, we'll use that term. [Pause]
182:32:16 Pogue: Right.
182:32:19 Eisele: That's really what it is.
182:32:20 Pogue: Okay.

182:36:59 Eisele: Roger, Houston.
182:37:00 Pogue: Say, Donn, I have a question about this glitch on the number 1 ball. We had a reading here that even with the ORDEAL power switch OFF, the switch must be in INERTIAL on the ORDEAL panel to present ORDEAL selection when you switch back to ball 1. Do you happen to know whether or not the switch was to INERTIAL on the ORDEAL box when you had the trouble? [Pause]
182:37:34 Eisele: Bill, why don't you wait until Wally gets up after awhile, and you can discuss that. I wasn't awake when all that was going on, so I don't know what really happened.
182:37:40 Pogue: Okay. Disregard.
182:37:43 Eisele: He's awake. I could relay it to him. I think it would be easier if yon just talked to him later on.
182:37:46 Pogue: Okay. That'll be fine. [Long pause]

182:48:35 Pogue: Right. And, Donn, I copied a number just about LOS, and you were just starting to go unreadable. I copied 06853, and what was the significance of that number? [Pause]
182:48:47 Eisele: That was a radiation reading. Walt tells me we haven't been calling that down, so you can disregard it.

183:06:20 Eisele: Roger. That is the first contact over Madrid, isn't it, Bill?
183:06:24 Pogue: I think we got one last night. In fact, we had a little trouble getting the handover executed.
183:06:32 Cunningham: Roger, Bill. And good morning.
183:06:34 Pogue: Good morning, sir. I was told I had better be real careful talking to you today. [Pause]
183:06:45 Cunningham: Say again, Bill. Say again.
183:06:48 Pogue: Sorry, Walt. I thought that was Wally. [Long pause]
183:07:47 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read?
183:07:50 Cunningham: I read you loud and clear, Bill, but we've got an echo in the background.
183:07:54 Pogue: Roger. I hear you five-by, also with an echo. [Pause]
183:08:01 Cunningham: Did you understand the message that Donn gave you when I floved the secondary radiators, that I'd like to have somebody watching them pretty close?
183:08:08 Pogue: Yes, they said they had every intention of doing that, and they understood what you said. They underatood the intent. [Pause]
183:08:15 Cunningham: Okay. [Pause]
183:08:23 Pogue: And, Walt, we're coming up on LOS and - thought I'd just remind you that O2 fuel cell puree. [Pause]

183:36:33 Cunningham: Hey, Bill, we had the primary evaporator put on AUTO yesterday afternoon late in hopes that it would stroke sometime during the night and get reservieed. I can't verify it because I wasn't awake, but I don't believe it's operated all night long. We're on low power, and it's been almost 48 hours, so I'd like to find out about water - whether we ought to go ahead and mannually run it for a few minutes before I do the secondary coolant loop.
183:36:58 Pogue: Stand by.
Comm break.
183:39:26 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. EECOM advises that the evaporator was reserviced less than 4 to 8 hours ago. But it's okay to recycle the back pressure valve by the normal procedure passed up earlier, but they recommend that you don't add water to it. [Pause]
183:39:48 Cunningham: We're not going to add water, and we're not going to recycle it. We're going to go ahead with secondary coolant loop operation now.
183:39:56 Pogue: Walt, we're having a little keyhole trouble here. Would you say again, please?
183:40:00 Cunningham: We're not going to add water to it, and I'm not going to reservice it at this time. I'm going ahead with the secondary coolant loop operation.

184:06:08 Pogue: Wally, I have a question on this glitch you got in the number 1 ball when switching ... [Pause]
184:06:15 Schirra: It's not a glitch, Bill. It happened three times and stayed that way on the third time. I cannot transfer GEC's to number 1 ball. [Pause]
184:06:26 Pogue: Roger. One question that the ground would like to ask, and that is: what was the position of the inertial switch? Was the switch in INERTIAL on the audio panel? [Pause]
184:06:41 Schirra: That's affirmative.
184:06:42 Pogue: Roger. Thank you very much. [Pause]
184:06:53 Schirra: Bill, you still read?

184:07:03 Schirra: Roger. At first, I had it exactly right; then, it flipped right over. From then on, it kept flipping over. [Pause]
184:07:10 Pogue: Okay. I think that's significant.
184:07:13 Schirra: Roger.
184:07:14 Pogue: The fact that it was okay to start with ...
184:07:16 Schirra: Yes, but not very long.
184:07:18 Pogue: Okay. [Long pause]
184:07:29 Pogue: Right. Wally, the statement I got here was that even with the ORDEAL power switch OFF, you had to have INERTIAL selected to prevent this glitch from occurring when you select ORDEAL.
184:07:46 Schirra: I'm well aware of that. Roger.
184:07:48 Pogue: Roger. Okay. [Long pause]
184:08:21 Pogue: Walt, let me know when you have a minute. I'd like to cover about three points on the BIOMED harness. [Pause]
184:08:29 Cunningham: Okay. They better not be very elaborate points. I've got two sensors now with the good leads apparently hooked into the blue transducer. Over. [Pause]
184:08:40 Pogue: Okay. That's the yellow one hooked into the blue transducer. Is that correct?
184:08:48 Cunningham: Affirmative.
184:08:50 Pogue: Okay. I'll pass on the recommendation. First point is, they would like to have tape wrapped around the leads starting with the yellow connector and wrapping the tape around the leads for about 2 inches down from the yellow connector to avoid a fatigue area there where the wires go into the little yellow housing or plastic covering. [Ppause]
184:09:20 Schirra: Bill?
184:09:21 Pogue: Roger.
184:09:22 Schirra: Bill?
184:09:23 Pogue: Go.
184:09:25 Schirra: I think we better refer back to the accident board from where I stand. I'll have no triggers in the suit loop, and we've gone much too far with this kluge right now. Now when Donn Eisele has a hot signal condition there, we've reached the bitter end. If we get suited up for reentry, we're gonna take them off.
184:09:49 Pogue: Roger. Understand. Copied.
184:09:51 Schirra: Roger. I'm not yielding on that one.
184:09:58 Cunningham: Bill, last night I replaced the upper sternal sensor with a new one that was low enough to reach the lead. [Pause]
184:10:07 Pogue: Good. That was the final point. They just wanted to make sure if it was possible to get the two sternal sensors located so that they didn't put tension on the leads.
184:10:21 Cunningham: Right. I didn't think they wanted them right next to each other. I got it as low as I could, and they barely reach now. Look like it will probably work.
184:10:29 Pogue: Sounds good. Thank you very much.
184:10:31 Schirra: Bill, we've done all we can, I think, to make them work, and I'd rather not prevent a breakage because that's the thing that scares us. Donn had one, and I had one; and one more and we just may have trouble.
184:10:45 Pogue: Roger. I think there's been a good effort in that respect. I don't think there's any question from the ground.
184:10:52 Schirra: Okay. Thank you.

184:13:26 Schirra: Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 184 hours, 14 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We've lost contact with the Redstone tracking ship. We had some conversation on the ECS environmental control system, coolant loop test, which it was indicated from CapCom Pogue continues good. Then there was some biomedical harness conversation and Pogue was passing up instructions to them to wrap tape around the leads for two inches from the connect point and Astronaut Schirra indicated that they've gone far enough with those kluges, that Eisele had a hot signal condition and they've reached the bitter end at that point. He also said they'd done all they could do to make it work and since Eisele had a breakage and Schirra had a breakage, that was it. At 184:15, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control, 184 hours, 22 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We're approaching acquisition point at Merritt Island, Florida in a few seconds and that will carry us through Merritt Island, Antigua, and Bermuda stations. Then we'll have a couple of minutes about 3 minutes between LOS signal at Bermuda and the acquisition at Canary Islands. So this will be a relatively long pass. Let's listen in.

184:23:47 Schirra: Bill, we've got a ... for the day.
184:23:52 Pogue: You were garbled. Say again, please.
184:23:54 Schirra: We 'ye got a problem for the day.
184:23:56 Pogue: What's that?
184:23:58 Schirra: We are very worried, about the ears. They are all blocked up with these colds. We're having a time to get one to clear, and we are seriously considering reentering shirt sleeve. I'm afraid that we can't quite clear our ears on the way down, but if we do have to clear them on the way down, we'll have to take the helmets off. And then they become a hazard bouncing around the cockpit.
184:24:31 Schirra: We feel the risk of rupturing our ear drums is higher than the risk of injury without having our suits on. We realize the restraint harness won't fit us closely, and we are considering we can wear our life vest over our shirt-sleeve clothing.
184:24:49 Pogue: Roger. I think we understand what you are saying there, and there has bean considerable ground discussion regarding that.
184:24:57 Schirra: At this point in time, we feel the risk is lower to come in shirt sleeves than it is in the suits.
184:25:04 Pogue: Roger. Understand. Copy.

184:29:41 Pogue: Roger. Stand by. [Long pause]
184:30:29 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Right. At 186 plus 40, you power up the SCS, and ground will command up some S-band equipment, but all that is necessary on hoard is for you to power up the SCS.
184:30:47 Cunningham: Okay. On that same list, we have one cabin fan. We've been generally running without the cabin fans. Should I - do I have to - have to power that cabin fan up or not?
184:30:58 Pogue: No. You can leave it OFF.
184:31:00 Cunningham: I can leave the cabin fan OFF.

184:35:51 Pogue: Roger.
184:35:52 Schirra: We have a second crack that developed after burn 5, and it is extending a little bit. It cuts from across left to right above the number 1 in one hundred's hours, and it cuts into tens of hours. We're reporting these so that they are logged prior to landing. [Pause]
184:36:19 Pogue: Roger.
184:36:22 Schirra: So there are two cracks now in that piece of glass.
184:36:24 Pogue: Understand. Two cracks.
184:36:27 Schirra: Roger. And the second one was positively developed in flight - I can't really say about the first one.
184:36:34 Pogue: But this one yon noticed right after burn 5?

184:44:12 Cunningham (onboard): Give the CDR 15 clicks also.
This is Apollo Control, 184 hours, 44 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. During that pass, spacecraft commander Schirra indicated the problem for the day was as far as he was concerned was that he was very worried about the colds the crew has and the possibility of rupturing eardrums. And they were seriously considering reentering when the time comes in shirt sleeve mode. He also indicated that even if they did reenter in shirt sleeves, they could still wear their life vests. It was passed up to him that what to be done in that situation was still being considered here on the ground. CAPCOM Pogue indicated that - the ground will power up some equipment at 186 hours, 40 minutes. All the crew has to do on Apollo 7 is power up the SCS (Stabilization and Control System). Schirra indicated there is another small crack in the mission timer glass and he noticed that after the SPS burn this morning, the number five burn. So that makes a total of two cracks in that glass which is incidental but he reported it as a matter of interest. At 184 hours, 45 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control; 185 hours, 10 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We're coming up on Carnarvon, let's stand by.

185:54:48 Pogue: Would yon say the last part there, Walt? I didn't quite understand.
185:54:53 Cunningham: On the secondary coolant loop DTO, I logged the fuel cell curves when we started the test. What are the other two blanks for what times? One's when you've got the high power on, I would imagine, but I don't know what the third one's for.

185:58:20 Pogue: Roger. We're getting it on the DSE, and it's running. Also, in relation to the FDAI 1, apparently, the troops thought they had it figured out here, but it had to do with the switch not being in INERTIAL, and when you said it was, it sort of threw them back to the drawing board, and they're still looking at it.

186:57:42 Schirra: Negative.
186:57:43 Pogue: Roger. And second ...
186:57:45 Schirra: Wait a minute. Donn did one before the rendezvous.
186:57:49 Pogue: Okay. Fine. That's good; thank you.
186:57:51 Schirra: Do you want the numbers on that, or did you lose them?
186:57:55 Pogue: Stand - I'll wait until they ask you for them here. Apparently, they just want you to know if you've done it. Second point, have you done a P53 and a 54 using the COAS?
186:58:07 Schirra: Negative.
186:58:09 Pogue: Thank you.
186:58:10 Schirra: We probably almost had to. [Long pause]

186:58:58 Pogue: Right 1 degree and up 1 degree.
186:59:01 Schirra: That's right 1 degree and up 1 degree. Basically, that means there's a space across left 1 degree and down 1 degree to be aligned.s
186:59:10 Pogue: Roger.
186:59:12 Schirra: In front of the target.
186:59:13 Pogue: Roger.

187:00:13 Pogue: Roger. Go.
187:00:14 Schirra: Roger. On power up, we had 0.8 degrees per second in yaw to the right, zero in roll, and zero in pitch.
187:00:24 Pogue: Roger. 0.8 degrees per second yaw right, zero roll, zero pitch.
187:00:30 Schirra: That's correct.
187:00:32 Pogue: Also, we have been monitoring the power load here. The delta is about 300 watts. We would like to bring up inverter 3 to main A, but don't put on either bus. This will give you an additional 100 watts. [Pause]
187:00:52 Cunningham: Roger. You want to run that inverter without load, then, for the next 4 and 1/2 hours?
187:00:59 Pogue: That's affirmative. [Long pause]

Then we will have continuous acqulsition with the spacecraft for some 22 minutes through Bermuda and at 187 hours and 04 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control, 187 hours, 21 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We're coming up on the Huntsville Tracking Ship now. We should have acquisition in about 10 seconds. Let's standby.
GUAIMAS through BERMUDA (REV 118)
187:25:28 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston through Guaymas. [Pause]
187:25:35 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause]
187:25:50 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston: Like O2 tank 2 fans ON 3 minutes and then OFF.
187:25:57 Schirra: Roger, La Porte. [Long pause]
187:26:51 Schirra: Houston, we have changed canister 16.
187:26:58 Pogue: Roger. Canister 16; thank you.
187:27:00 Schirra: Roger. I'll be coming up on humidity check soon.
187:27:05 Pogue: Roger. [Long pause]
187:27:27 Schirra: We haven't had much luck with this revised sleep schedule, Bill. It's been revised to fit the flight plan this way. We're all up and going at 2:00 in the morning Cape time. You understand why, because we're trying to stack this stuff in for Sunday night - Monday night, excuse me. [Long pause]
187:28:05 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Understand that last transmission had to do - something about a sleep cycle. We're still a bit low; COMM is not too good right now.
187:28:14 Schirra: Roger. We're not having much luck with our sleep.
187:28:17 Pogue: Roger. Understand that. [Pause]
187:28:31 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
187:28:35 Schirra: Roger. I think we'll still have a good show for you tonight though Bill. [Pause]
187:28:42 Pogue: Roger.
187:28:44 Schirra: We have just finished rehearsing. [Long pause]
187:29:07 Schirra: Houston, do you still read?
187:29:09 Pogue: Roger. Apollo 7. Go.
187:29:11 Schirra: Okay. Are you going to pass on our comments about a probable - I would like to put it that way - shirt-sleeve reentry?
187:29:18 Pogue: Roger. I have already passed that on.
187:29:20 Schirra: Okay. I guess we'll talk about that the next watch or something. Is that right?
187:29:24 Pogue: Roger. [Pause]
GUAYMAS through BERMUDA (REV 119)
187:29:31 Pogue: Yes. We've been talking about that for a couple of days in fact.
187:29:34 Schirra: Yes, and I just got a real kleenex full. [Pause]
187:29:47 Schirra: How did that consultant's idea come out? [Pause]
187:29:56 Pogue: Say again.
187:29:57 Schirra: The consultant who said if we hadn't flown we probably would have gotten colds anyway.
187:30:02 Pogue: Oh, I don't know. [Pause]
187:30:08 Communications Technician: [Garble].
187:30:12 Pogue: I don't know about that.
187:30:15 Schirra: Yes. Okay, Bill. [Pause]
187:30:21 Pogue: The gold team hasn't 'got to read any newspapers. We're all working.
187:30:26 Schirra: Ho, ho, ho! [Pause]
187:30:33 Eisele: Are you going to rush home and watch the television show this morning, Bill?
187:30:37 Pogue: No, I'm going to watch it from here this morning.
187:30:40 Schirra: You are going to sleep in, huh?
187:30:43 Eisele: Is that show carried live every morning?
187:30:45 Pogue: Right. It is, and we're - this shift goes through the television sequence this morning.
187:30:53 Schirra: You're really in there, huh?
187:30:55 Pogue: Oh, boy.
187:30:56 Schirra: You're getting all the big ones: burn 5, television.
187:31:01 Cunningham: How does that picture turn out over the cammercial screen by the time it gets there?
187:31:05 Pogue: It's pretty good. In fact, I was very surprised the first time I saw it. I was ready for something like what we saw out at integrated, and it turned out it was not difficult at all to recognize you, and I was really impressed with the quality.
187:31:22 Schirra: I gather the recommendation is to move rather slowly.
187:31:25 Pogue: Roger. Fast panning - of course, you get - sort of "burn in" on that vidicon, I guess. And if you move very slowly, it stays fairly sharp; and, of course, the steadier you hold the camera, the sharper the images.
187:31:40 Schirra: Very good. [Pause]
187:31:45 Eisele: Say, Bill, this is Donn. I called up several hours ago regarding some DTO's, and I wondered if you could run it by again to see if we could gin up an answer.
187:31:55 Pogue: Was this the one regarding the backup alignment?
187:31:58 Eisele: That's right.
187:32:00 Pogue: Roger. The readings I have on that is they would still like to do both of them. The first one gives you a check on your GDC and IMU both. You align the GDC, and then you drag it over to an attitude; and then you align the IMU, and when you do the star check at that point, you get a gross additive error from the time at which you started the process. The second DTO involves a GDC alignment to a known IMU, and this gives you a good handle on the error in the GDC alignment itself, and this, they think, is going to give them information in properly evaluating the total error on the GDC and IMU alignment.
187:32:55 Eisele: I can see the rest now, but I think it's getting awfully pure.
187:32:59 Schirra: Yes. Anytime we have to use the line, we can try GDC align to it. [Pause]
187:33:04 Schirra: Isn't that right?
187:33:06 Pogue: That's affirmative. [Long pause]
187:33:28 Schirra: Bill, what planet is that right next to the Moon?
187:33:29 Pogue: Stand by.
187:33:30 Schirra: We are looking at it right now; you ought to walk outside. [Long pause]
187:33:43 Schirra: We are guessing Venus. [Long pause]
187:34:04 Pogue: I have a further - they are checking on that planet, by the way. I have further information on this DTO. They are looking right now at replacing the backup IMU alignment with a P53 - P54 COAS.
187:34:20 Schirra: That sounds more exciting.
187:34:22 Eisele: That sounds a little more sensible to me.
187:34:26 Pogue: Okay.
187:34:28 Schirra: I thought you were building up to that with that COAS check and all that good stuff. [Long pause]
187:34:45 Pogue: The planet is Jupiter.
187:34:48 Schirra: Jupiter? Oh.
187:34:49 Pogue: By jove.
187:34:50 Schirra: It's a real pretty sight; we got the sunrise, "yewpiter", and then the Moon, all within about 8 degrees of each other. [Pause]
187:35:02 Schirra: Negative. About 20 degrees. I can still see the Moon, but Jupiter is out of sight, and the Sun is up. [Ppause]
187:35:15 Schirra: And they sparkle plenty.
187:35:18 Pogue: Right. [Long pause]
187:35:38 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. The secondary coolant loop is still performing excellently.
187:35:43 Schirra: Okay.
Long comm break.
187:38:50 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston.
187:38:53 Schirra: Go ahead.
187:38:54 Pogue: Roger. If Donn is ready to copy, I have this change in relation to this DTO. [Pause]
187:39:01 Schirra: Roger. We're just doing a humidity check. [Pause]
187:39:05 Pogue: Okay. I'll stand by.
187:39:07 Schirra: Go ahead. I can write it on the flight plan.
187:39:09 Pogue: Okay. At 191 plus 40 in the flight plan, you can delete the reference in the MCC update box there regarding a backup IMU alignment and replace it with T align time for P54. Just T align for P54. [Pause]
187:39:40 Schirra: Okay. [Pause]
187:39:48 Pogue: And at 193 hours, delete IMU backup align and reference to sextant star check at 193 plus 30; don't need to write that down, I don't think - with P53 - P54 IMU backup align with COAS. [Long pause]
187:40:27 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
187:40:35 Pogue: And this is merely a note: recommended P52 option 3 at the station of sequence as a check; power down at completion of sequence. The aproximate RCS consumption will be 3 to 2 pounds. [Long pause]
187:40:57 Schirra: That's a nice prediction. Okay.
187:40:59 Pogue: And that's it.

This is Apollo Control, 187 hours, 43 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. During that pass we heard Apollo 7 Commander Schirra indicating they are not having much luck with their sleep cycles. Schirra so said he wanted to talk about a probable probable shirt sleeve reentry and that he would talk on the next shift, meaning the next shift here in the Control Center which comes on at seven o'clock in the morning Central Daylight Time. Schirra wondered about the television and asked if it was carried live and Cap Com Pogue indicated, "Yes it was". Schirra then asked, "How does the picture turn out?", Pogue said, "Fine". Then there was some talk on the ECS environmental control system secondary coolant loop which is still performing excellently in the test that has been going on for several hours of that loop. It was also indicated that they'd like to use the crew optical alinement sight instead of the sextant in the IMU inertial measuring unit backup alinement which will take place later on in the mission today. We have acquisition at the Canary Islands coming up at 187 hours, 47 minaltes some two minutes from now, a little more than two minutes from now, we'll just stand by for that pass.
CANARY (REV 119)

187:48:01 Schirra (onboard): Roger, loud and clear.
187:49:03 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
187:49:09 Cunningham: Go.
187:49:11 Pogue: Roger. Walt, I'd like to go over this relay COMM mode test. [Pause]
187:49:20 Cunningham: Roger. Bill, we've already done that once, and we'll just configure it the same way we did then, right?
187:49:26 Pogue: Well, this is for USB up and VHF down.
187:49:32 Cunningham: Right. It's the same switch configuration for either one. Any exception to the exeeption? [Long pause]
187:49:53 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Walt, they say the test didn't work last time, and EECOM would like for me to go ahead and go through this check the way they have written it to see - to make sure they have covered all their bets here. [Pause]
187:50:10 Schirra: Bill, is it any different on their slide rule? [Pause]
187:50:15 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Pause]
187:50:20 Cunningham: I can plot for you with our slide rule, and pass up the differences, will you?
187:50:26 Pogue: Roger. Okay. You configure the center audio panel per side 2 the COMM slide rule relay mode; and, in additionto that, do the following: on the center audio panel, the CMP's VOX sensitivity thumb wheel to 06. [Pause]
187:50:52 Cunningham: VOX sensitivity to 06.
187:50:54 Pogue: S-band normal voice relay. [Pause]
187:51:02 Cunningham: Roger.
187:51:03 Pogue: VHF AMA Duplex, VHF AMB OFF, and squelch B setting to 05. [Pause]
187:51:17 Cunningham: Okay. The only thing you added to the normal procedure is the squelch B setting to 5; and I think there's a VOX mode higher than that last one, isn't there?
187:51:33 Pogue: Walt, we don't know what they had last time, but we'd like for you to have it set up this way before Carnarvon acquisition, and that will be at 188 plus 21, and we'll try to contact you on this mode for Carnarvon. We have a very brief pass by Tananarive at 06.
187:51:58 Cunningham: Understand. Wilco.

This is Apollo Control; 187 hours, 53 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We're now leaving Canary Islands acquisition on 119th revolution. We will be coming up at Tananarive at 188 hours and 06 minutes. This is the revolution where on the stateside pass coming over the United States, we will have a television dump. They will set up the TV, should'be setting it up at 188 hours into the mission, they will turn the TV on at 189 hours and 02 minutes into the mission, the TV pass will be 189 hours, 04 minutes through 189 hours, 15 minutes. The pass should start at approximately 7:10 this morning Central Daylight Time. At 187 hours, 54 minutes, this is Apollo Control.

188:09:20 Cunningham: Would you get us a map update and a right ascension for the star chart, please?
188:09:25 Pogue: Roger. Will. [Long pause]
188:09:46 Pogue: Rev 121, 192 plus - stand by; disregard that one. For Rev 121, it's 191 plus 49 plus 39, nodal crossing at 147.0 east; right ascension for star chart update is 02 33.
188:10:23 Cunningham: Roger. Understand. The right ascension is 2 hours and 33 minutes, right?
188:10:28 Pogue: Affirmative. [Pause]
188:10:29 Cunningham (onboard): Thank you.
188:10:30 Pogue: And for one - did you just want a star chart update?
188:10:34 Cunningham: No, I wanted both.
188:10:37 Pogue: Roger. Then for - [Long pause]
188:10:54 Pogue: Walt, when you said you wanted that for two revs ahead, did you mean to go to the second rev beyond, like one, two, one?
188:11:05 Cunningham: Forget that, Bill.
188:11:06 Pogue: Okay.
188:11:08 Eisele: I don't think it matters that much, Bill.
188:11:10 Pogue: Okay, Donn.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 188 hours, 14 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We've just lost acquisition at Tannanarive. Our next contact point will be Carnarvon, Australia at 188 hours, 21 minutes. At 188:14 this is ApollO Control.

188:29:07 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston.
188:29:08 Cunningham: Go, Houston.
188:29:10 Pogue: I have been asked to pass on some helpful househould hints here on TV improvement.
188:29:19 Schirra: Go ahead.
188:29:20 Cunningham: Go ahead.
188:29:21 Pogue: (Laughter) You sound pretty eager there. Right. One of the things they have mentioned is to remove the lens and blow the dust off the vidicon tube; second, clean the lens; third, the best quality is obtained with a fixed mount; fourth, they would like for you to try for some window views over Texas.
188:29:50 Cunningham: I thought that the spacecraft motion over the ground precluded getting any good window views. [Pause]
188:29:57 Pogue: I concur; I saw your attempts. I saw one good shot of the Florida coast, however, but I was just passing on this information.
188:30:09 Schirra: Okay. We won't be in active hold today, and we'll plan it tomorrow.
188:30:14 Pogue: Okay.
188:30:15 Schirra: If we are drifting, it's almost impossible.
188:30:17 Pogue: Roger. Understand.
188:30:18 Schirra: Okay.
188:30:20 Swigert: Hey, Wally, this is Jack.
188:30:23 Schirra: Good morning.
188:30:24 Swigert: Good morning. If you take any pictures of the ground, the camera has to be very, very still.
188:30:31 Schirra: Understand. Think you will come in for the TV production? [Pause]
188:30:36 Swigert: No, I was just watching.
188:30:39 Schirra: Okay.
188:30:41 Cunningham: We'll follow the rest of the hints from Heloise. [Long pause]
188:31:03 Eisele: There must be a great demand for this sort of thing, to get all these hints.
188:31:09 Swigert: You just don't know how much of a demand there is. [Pause]
188:31:19 Cunningham: We haven't decided yet whether our category is a preplanned series or a special. [Long pause]
188:31:45 Schirra: Jack, by the way, who's doing the interiors for the [garble] now? [Pause]
188:31:55 Swigert: We missed that, Wally.
188:31:57 Schirra: Like Peter Hackett does on NBC, who does the interiors [garble]. [Long pause]
HONEYSUCKLE. (REV 119)
188:32:12 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. S-band volume up, please.
188:32:16 Schirra: We'll check the VHF chanel not clear.
188:32:23 Swigert: Yes, we got some interference there, also.
188:32:25 Schirra: We got a bunch. [Pause]
188:32:31 Schirra: Did you follow last question?
188:32:33 Swigert: No, I didn't, Wally.
188:32:35 Schirra: Typically, they show the interior of a spacecraft; they got a mockup. Who is the announcer for the mockups?
188:32:47 Swigert: I haven't seen any of the commerical television myself. The only television I've seen is when it comes over our monitor here; and we're getting it live, and it's going out live through the networks.
188:33:00 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause]
188:33:50 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We would like O2 tank 2 fans back OFF.
188:33:55 Schirra: Okay. [Pause]
188:34:00 Schirra: They're off.
188:34:01 Swigert: Thank you. [Long pause]
188:34:38 Schirra: When you ask for 3 minutes, you really get them.
188:34:40 Swigert: Roger. Stir them up good.
188:34:44 Schirra: Roger.
188:34:47 Schirra: Should we get out and start all over again? Good morning. [Long pause]
188:35:23 Schirra: Houston, are you deleting the hydrogen fuel cell purges?
188:35:27 Swigert: Yes, all of them are deleted.
188:35:29 Schirra: Roger.
188:35:32 Swigert: We will schedule them when we need them.
188:35:37 Schirra: Roger.

188:37:46 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up on AOS Hawaii at 50.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, 188 hours, 38 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We are coming up on revolution 119 during which Stateside pass we will have live television from the spacecraft. We would like to go back now and do a wrap up from 181 hours into the mission up to now. Everything was quiet up to 182 hours, correct that, 183 hours, 36 minutes. The spacecraft started on an environmental control system secondary coolant loop test, which was in the flight plan. It looked good and it has remained on from that time on and continues to look good up to this time. At revolution 116, 184 hours into the mission, astronaut Cunningham was talking about the biomed harness check. They have had a certain amount of difficulty with biomedical readouts here at the control center through the mission. Astronaut Pogue, the CapCom, indicated that the instructions were from the medics here to wrap tape around the leads for about 2 inches from the connect point. Astronaut Schirra, spacecraft commander, then indicated that he felt that they had gone far enough with the kluges, which means "make-shift" changes. He indicated that Eisele had a hot signal condition, and he indicated that they had reached the bitter end. They have done all they can do to make the biomedical harness work, and he said Eisele had a breakage and Schirra had a breakage, and he was a little concerned about continuing the onboard fixing of that particular system. At 184 hours into the mission astronaut Schirra indicated that the problem for the day, in his opinion, was that they were very worried about colds and the possibility of rupturing eardrums on reentry. They were seriously considering reentering in shirt sleeves, and he also indicated that even if they did, they can still wear life vests, in case they had to get out of the spacecraft in the water. We had a unified S-band communication test, which was a back-up test and very successful. Schirra indicated that there was another small crack in the mission timer glass, the viewing glass. They noticed that after the SPS, the service propulsion system no. 5 burn, which took place yesterday. So there are a total of two cracks in the glass at this time. At 185 hours, 53 minutes we got a GO for revolution 135-1, which means through 134 revolutions of the Earth. For the spacecraft, all the systems were satisfactory. The coolant loop test continued to go in good shape. There were good fuel cell current readouts here at MCC. At 186 hours and revolution 118, the unified S-band back-up test took place satisfactorily. At 186 hours, 45 minutes, Apollo 7 indicated that they had taken one frame of photography of the Sharks Bay in the Carnarvon area and one frame of a town about 60 miles south of Carnarvon that they could not identify. Revolution 118, 187 hours, 25 minutes, astronaut Schirra indicated that they were not having much luck with their sleep cycles. He said he wanted to talk about a probable shirt sleeve reentry and that he would talk about it on the next shift, which means the next shift here in the control center, which will take place in the next 10 to 15 minutes. Schirra asked a question, "If television was carried live down here on Earth?", and astronaut Pogue answered, "Yes". Schirra asked, "How does the picture turn out?", and Pogue said, "Fine". At that time the secondary coolant loop still performing excellently, as it has, as I said, all through the test. It was passed up to the crew that they would like to have the crew optical alignment sight used instead of the sextant for the initial measuring backup alignment test, which is scheduled a few hours from now. They went through a communications checklist and a relay node test, which turned out satisfactorily. On revolution 119, which is the current revolution, 188 hours, 21 minutes into the flight, astronaut Pogue indicated that if it was at all possible on the television pass, we would like to have window views over Texas. At that time the crew indicated that it was likely not possible because of movement of the spacecraft. Apollo 7 also indicated that they were not quite sure which category they should go up for, whether it should be a weeklong series or a special category. The current schedule for the TV is as follows: they have set up the television at 188 hours into the mission, the television will be turned on at 189 hours and 2 minutes, the television pass should last from 189 hours, 4 minutes through 189 hours, 15 minutes. At 188 hours, 45 minutes into the flight, coming up completing revolution 119 this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control; 188 hours, 50 minutes into the flight of Apollo 7. We're coming up on a stateside pass, we should have Hawaii tracking station acquisition in a very few seconds. We'll then remain live through the stateside pass until we lose acquisition off the Florida coast. Let's join in on the conversation.
HAWAII (REV 119)
188:50:53 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
188:50:54 Eisele: Roger, Bill.
Comm break.
188:52:13 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
188:52:19 Eisele: Roger.
188:52:22 Eisele: Do you read? [Pause]
188:52:28 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7. You read? Over.
188:52:30 Pogue: Roger. Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read?
188:52:33 Cunningham: Fine. I heard your first call , Bill.
188:52:35 Pogue: Okay.
188:52:36 Cunningham: [Garble] the narrative, too?
188:52:38 Pogue: Say again, Apollo 7.
Comm break.
188:53:41 Cunningham: Roger. When they go live with this television, do they carry the narrative, too?
188:53:45 Pogue: Affirmative.
Comm break.
188:55:04 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Give me a short count, please.
188:55:10 Schirra: Short count: one, two, three, four, five, five, four, three, two, one. Over.
188:55:14 Pogue: Roger. Read you five-square with a little scratch.
188:55:19 Schirra: That was an itch. [Pause]
188:55:27 Schirra: If you could see the beards we have, you would sympathize.
188:55:29 Pogue: Roger. Tie aren't reading your VHF. We're picking you up on S-band.
188:55:35 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
188:55:39 Pogue: You might check S-hand NORMAL voice-to-voice and VHF AMA to SIMPLEX.s
188:55:44 Cunningham: Roger. I confirm those switch positions.
188:55:47 Pogue: Roger. [Pause]
188:55:55 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite ommi.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We're currently still scheduling to turn the television at 189 hours, 2 minutes into the mission and for the live pass to begin hopefully with good quality at 189:04, so we will be turned on some time around 5 minutes from this time. Apollo 7 inquired as to whether this was a live and narrative picture going out and the reply from CapCom Pogue was yes it was.
188:57:09 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read now?
Comm break.
HUNTSVILLE (REV 119)
188:58:20 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston through Huntsville. How do you read?
188:58:26 Cunningham: Fine, Bill. Well, a little weak now. How about you?
188:58:30 Pogue: I'm reading you about three-by-three.
188:58:34 Cunningham: Roger. Look, we'll turn the camera at 02, and we would like to hear a call from you when you are receiving the picture so we can get the show rolling.
188:58:44 Pogue: Roger. Understand. I'm ready any time you are, Sea Bee. [Long pause]
This is Apollo Control, astronaut Schirra just called and asked to be informed when we were receiving the television picture, because he wanted to get the show rolling and CapCom Pogue replied, "Roger, anytime you're ready, CB."
188:58:57 Schirra: [Garble] into millions. [Long pause]
188:59:49 Cunningham: Hey, Bill. Do you read?
188:59:51 Pogue: Roger. Go.
188:59:53 Cunningham: Roger. I show that the tapes - okay, our tape is stopped here dumping. I'm going to go off the tape and turn the TV switch on the S-band AUX.
189:00:01 Pogue: Roger. [Long pause]
189:00:37 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. We'll command the tape switch from the ground. [Pause]
189:00:43 Cunningham: Roger. I've got selected now.
189:00:46 Pogue: Roger.
Comm break.
189:02:28 Communications Technician: Huntsville LOS. [Long pause]
This is Apollo Control. The Texas station acquiiition will be 189:03:46. We are coming up now in acquisition with Guaymas, Mexico.
This is Apollo Control. The TV canera should be turned at this time.
GUAYMAS through ANTIGUA (REV 119)
189:02:45 Schirra: This is Apollo 7. Do you read?
189:02:47 Pogue: Roger. Go.
189:02:49 Schirra: Do you have a picture?
189:02:50 Pogue: Negative. I'll give you a call as soon as we get one.
189:02:55 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause]
This is Apollo Control. The caners is on. Our TV pass is scheduled to start in some 55 seconds from now at 189:04.
189:03:38 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. We are starting to receive it now.
189:03:41 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause]
189:03:54 Pogue: We can't quite tell the perspective here. Looks like we are looking down at one of the couches.
189:03:58 Schirra: That is affirmative. Good morning, Houston; you are looking down the couches. The crew is out just now for a coffee break. I think you will find that without the crew here, there is absolutely nothing to fear - nothing to fear. This is a taped message.
189:04:16 Pogue: Is this a fully automated flight?
189:04:18 Cunningham: That's affirm. At this point, I would like to give you slow scan of the cockpit. The crew is out for a short break, so we will find them shortly, I'm sure. As we look across the couches, you will notice that we are coming through to the total instrument panel and then coming around the panel. You will note that we have a full amount of lighting in here, which helps us under all conditions.
189:04:43 Pogue: That is an excellent picture right there.
189:04:45 Schirra: Roger. There is back lights in the panel as well as front lighting with floodlights. We are using floodlights now.
189:04:52 Pogue: That is very good.
189:04:53 Schirra: Looking at the heart of the spacecraft - as far as reference goes, the so-called FDAI, the flight direction attitude indicator - you are viewing now the various attitudes, and that system is not operating. We are in drifting flight. We will start with our entry monitor system, which we will use Monday evening - actually Tuesday morning - to return. The myriad of switches you see here are for controlling the various attitude thrusters and for monitoring the launch boosters. I'll pass it on to another unseen hand, and you can view on his panel some of the results. [Long pause]
GUAYMAS through ANTIGUA (REV 120)
189:05:46 Eisele: On this portion of the panel, you see the DSKY, that is, the display keyboard for our onboard computer. We use the computer for various calculations for Earth orbit, navigation, and for aligning the inertial platform. Oh, I see someone is coming in now. [Pause]
189:06:14 Eisele: Good morning, Captain. Up above the display keyboard is another instrument identical to the one that Wally just described. The reason we have two is that if one fails, we will have a backup. Also, we have two completely separate attitude reference systems; we can have one displayed on one ball, and the other on this one in front of you. Now, I will pass the camera on down to the next unseen hand.
189:06:48 Cunningham: Roger. Good morning to everyone in television land. You are looking at the right-hand portion of the main display console. The upper left-hand portion of your view, you will see the instrument that has to do with the cryogenics that are used to power the fuel cells and provide breathing oxygen in the spacecraft. Just beneath those, the round dials are devoted exclusively to environmental control system monitor functions; and immediately below those, the switches which control the environmental control system. Moving on slightly over to the right, we have several meters which monitor the service propulsion system which were used during the burns we made the other day. I see we have another crewman coming in from his coffee break here, and here he comes, ladies and gentlemen. Lo and behold, it is our navigator; he found himself. Continuing here just briefly, we have a large number of switches at the bottom of this panel which have to do solely with communication. One of those switches you might be able to read - it is labeled TV and by turning that switch on, we started to send this picture to you.
189:08:21 Eisele: This instrument here is the quantity meter for our main propulsion system. It reads out to - percentage quantity remaining. And here comes a third member of our party, arriving. [Long pause]
189:08:44 Eisele: Old Smoothie himself. [Long pause]
189:09:02 Schirra: It is known in the parlance of spacecraft talk that we have a crew commander. What is not known too well by many is that we run a taut ship here, and to maintain physical discipline as well as moral discipline, we carry on a local, orderly drill instruction period. At this time, gentlemen, left face. About face - about - about face; crewmen drift. As you can see, we have our lighter moments. [Pause]
189:09:47 Pogue: Oh, that's bad. [Long pause]
189:10:01 Schirra: As you can see, our spacecraft provides both lighter moments and moments of relaxation. We have one other motion that is called enforced march, which might be indicative of the control we have in the new mode, as we have titled it, intravehicular activity or IVA. This is somewhat modernized over the older form of activity of EVA.
189:10:28 Schirra: Hup two. You may note from this that we have our ups and downs. [Long pause]
189:10:46 Eisele: We have got to get a new writer. Just a second, and we will dolly in camera 2 and see what the erstwhile drill sergeant is doing. [Long pause]
189:11:05 Eisele: And there we have him. You can see he has been working very hard. Wally has been drilling his troops.
189:11:10 Pogue: Yes, there we are.
189:11:14 Eisele: Do you see the drill master here?
189:11:17 Pogue: Right. We have a good picture again. We lost it for just a minute.
189:11:23 Eisele: Roger. We switched it off and dollied in camera number 2.
189:11:26 Pogue: I see.
189:11:27 Eisele: That's all technical talk among us television people. [Pause]
189:11:35 Schirra: You tell 'em [garble].
189:11:37 Pogue: They want to know what kind of dollies you have?
189:11:40 Eisele: Not the right kind. [Long pause]
189:11:56 Schirra: We are going to try to get another lens up. We are - we're tempted to show you the outside. This is rather good weather. We will get a long telephoto lens on it. At this time, I will show you the long equipment bay while Walt is digging out that lens. The weather is somewhat scattered. Quite a few large cloud formations overcast over the Gulf. I believe if you will bear with us, we will change lenses and get an outside view.
189:12:23 Pogue: Good show, Wally. The picture is exceptionally good today.
189:12:27 Schirra: Roger. The camera is going OFF.
189:12:28 Pogue: Right. [Long pause]
189:12:42 Schirra: Okay. We are going outside. Do you want ALC OUT or IN?
189:12:46 Pogue: We want adjacent omni first. Stand by.
189:12:50 Schirra: Okay. We're outside. Camera's coming ON.
189:12:55 Pogue: ALC out, please. We do not have a picture. [Long pause]
This is Apollo Control. Hopefully, we have about 2 more minutes of pictures coming through. At this time time, we do not have a picture coming through.
189:13:15 Pogue: We still don't have a picture.
189:13:18 Schirra: [Garble]. [Pause]
189:13:23 Pogue: We must be right on the fringe of reception. [Pause]
189:13:30 Pogue: Try opposite omni, please. [Long pause]
This is Apollo Control, Houston. We still do not have further picture. We have about 1 minute 15 seconds left to go.
189:13:54 Schirra: Roger. We're turning camera off.
189:13:55 Pogue: Okay. [Long pause]
189:14:25 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Confirm you have turned the camera off.
189:14:29 Schirra: Yes.
189:14:30 Pogue: Roger.
189:14:31 Schirra: Next time, we will have to get better material or better writers.
189:14:39 Pogue: It's also suggested better actors,
189:14:44 Schirra: Our actors' equity demands more sleep next time.
189:14:47 Pogue: Right.
189:14:49 Schirra: We would have thought of a better plot, but we didn't get enough sleep last night.
189:14:54 Pogue: Okay. I get the point.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 189 hours, 15 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We have just completed our television pass. We are passing out of the acquisition point for the Mila Merritt Island facility in Florida. We will have acquisition with Bermuda. Let's stand by.
This is Apollo Control; 189 hours, 15 minutes into the mission. When the TV pass was made over Texas - over Houston - the spacecraft was sighted and we got an excellent visual contact with the spacecraft as it flew by.
189:16:58 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. The secondary loop still looks very good. About one and a half minutes LOS; Tananarive at 41.
189:17:09 Cunningham: Roger. Bill, can you give us a readout on what our waste water quantity was at the start of this test, and what we're showing now?
189:17:18 Pogue: Right now the waste water is 55.8 percent. Stand by for the previous reading.
189:17:25 Schirra (onboard): Roger, at 83 - at 183:40.
189:17:26 Cunningham: Roger. At 183:40. [Pause]
189:17:33 Schirra: And, Bill, we welcome suggestions for tomorrow's bit.
189:17:37 Pogue: Go.
189:17:38 Schirra: We need them.
189:17:42 Pogue: I'm sorry you were cut out. Say again.
189:17:43 Schirra: (Laughter).
189:17:44 Schirra: We welcome suggestions for tomorrow's bit. [Pause]
189:17:51 Pogue: I'm sorry. I didn't get that, Wally.
189:17:52 Schirra: We welcome a new script for tomorrow.
189:17:56 Pogue: Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. I guess you've get as many ideas as we do. That was actually very good today. That was the best I've seen the picture. I thought the pictures of the instrument panel were very good.
189:18:09 Schirra: I'm talking about that other part. No acting awards today?
189:18:15 Pogue: I'm afraid to say anithing. [Pause]
189:18:24 Eisele: Okay. If you're so smart, you come up here and do it.
189:18:27 Pogue: Hey! I welcome the opportunity.
Very long comm break.
189:37:15 Eisele (onboard): 189 hours, 29 minutes into the flight; magazine R, frame 34, that's southwest - no, the African coast [garble].

189:43:46 Cunningham (onboard): Frame 47, same magazine, southwest coast of Africa, a little farther north.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 189 hours, 45 minutes into the flight, and we've had a shift change here in the Control Center as you probably noticed. The severe weather conditions in the far west Pacific, that typhoon off the Japanese coast, has closed our normal - 3 landing area, that zone about 250 to 300 miles south and east of the Japanese shore. We have temporarily moved - we've picked a new landing site in the west Pacific, a point about six or eight hundred miles north of Samoa. I do not know at this time what our ship or airplane configuration is in that area. We expect to get a reading from the recovery room very shortly, but the ships that had been assigned - the ships and planes that had been assigned to the western Pacific landing area have been directed to port or landing fields in Japan while the typhoon moves through the area. The Capsule Communicator put through a call, an establishing call, to Apollo 7 via Tananarive. It was simply a tag up. We've had no communication and we expect none. At 189 hours, 47 minutes into the flight this is Apollo Control, Houston.
189:49:06 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We're about LOS Tananarive. Do you want to turn up your S-band volume? We have an ARIA aircraft in about 3 minutes.
Long comm break.

189:56:32 Cunningham: Roger, Houston. You just -
189:56:33 Cunningham (onboard): - sounded a little louder that time.
189:56:35 Swigert: Roger, Walt. You faded out, also. We'll just stand by here on ARIA and pick you up at Carnarvon in a few minutes.
189:56:44 Cunningham: I've got a little dope on the pictures we've been taking with the 16mm. You can pass on to the photo lab. I've labeled the reels as we take them - 1, 2, 3, 4, et cetera, we'd like to keep them together if they will.
189:57:01 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
CARNARVON (REV 120)
189:57:14 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7.
189:57:16 Swigert: Roger. Walt, I got your comments on the 16mm film. You've labeled the reels 1, 2, 3, 4?
189:57:23 Cunningham: On to the end, some of the reels overlap, so we'd like to see them kept in that order.
189:57:30 Swigert: Okay. Understand.
189:57:32 Cunningham: And they shouldn't be released until we take a look at them.
189:57:35 Swigert: Okay.
189:57:36 Cunningham: This is the movies that we've taken onboard, and I assume you people are monitoring fuel cell 2 and giving its usual daily ditty, huh?
189:57:49 Swigert: That is affirmative.
Long comm break.
190:07:31 Swigert: Apollo 7, one minute LOS Carnarvon; Hawaii at 24.
190:07:39 Cunningham: Roger. Jack, and I'd like to log that the water gun has become very difficult to work. The trigger is slowly getting very, very hard to push - and retract, mostly.
190:07:52 Swigert: Okay. Copy that. [Pause]
190:08:01 Cunningham: And you remember yesterday we mentioned the chlorine injector, how it had a scum in it?
190:08:05 Swigert: Roger.
190:08:07 Cunningham: It died out overnight, apparemtly, and it had the form of salts this morning. I guess it's the kind of water that maybe something didn't get in and gum up the works on this water pistol, too. It's lasted - it's done very well up until now, but it's sure getting hard to work.
190:08:25 Swigert: Okay. Copy that, Walt. [Pause]
190:08:33 Cunningham: And log me 25 clicks of water, will you?
190:08:34 Swigert: Okay.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo ControI Houston at 190 hours, 09 minutes into the flight. Just by way of passing, our retrofire clock now shows 69 hours and 28 minutes. Apollo 7 came to us with an unusually clean communication by the ARIA aircraft, the tracking aircraft, in the middle of the Indian Ocean, and we have some tape on that, and we later tagged up with them over Carnarvon, and we're still - the spacecraft is now just about to leave the northeast Australian coast. In the course of this Australian pass Walt Cunningham noted, among other things, that the gunk, the brown gunky substance that coated the water pistol yesterday, which we reported on extensively, had over night turned to a rather salty coating. He didn't describe the color, but we would take from that, that it was white in color. A salty coating replacing the brown gunky material that was the subject of a lot of theories and speculation yesterday. He also reported that the water pistol is getting harder and harder to work. Apparently some physical difficulty in getting water out of the water gun. Cunningham doesn't note it in his communication, but there are at least two other sources of water onboard the spacecraft. The food preparation water has both hot water and cold water available, so for drinking they could simply tap in to the cold water tap on the food prep board. Here's an accumulation of the tape of our two last passes.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 190 hours, 26 minutes into the flight of Apollo 7, and the spacecraft is about to be acquired by Hawaii. A little bit more on the west Pacific weather situation. Two destroyers, two fleet destroyers, one called the Rupertus and the Tucker were called out of the west Pacific area southeast of Japan earlier this morning and were directed to Yokusuka Harbor. An intermediate landing area, a weather free intermediate landing area to the south and several hundred miles north of Samoa, near the Gilbert Islands, has been designated for revs 125 through 128, and it will be covered by aircraft from Tachikawa airport in Japan and also on the later revs from Samoa. Here is the crew getting the morning news.
HAWAII (REV 120)
190:27:23 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
190:27:28 Cunningham: Good morning, Jack. [Pause]
190:27:38 Cunningham: I'm planning to power back up the primary and shut down the secondary at 191:10.
190:27:44 Swigert: Roger. Copy that, and I have the morning news for you here. [Pause]
190:27:55 Cunningham: Okay. Jack, go ahead with the news.
190:27:58 Swigert: Okay. Hurricane Gladys is cutting across northern Florida, will probably head back out into the Atlantic. Seventy-two airliners were backed up on the runways at Kennedy yesterday morning when the fog finally lifted. And in the Post this morning, there is a picture of Jo and Hariet and Lo out in the early morning hours trying to spot your spacecraft as it went over. And there's been a big flap at the Olympics over a couple of black US athletes who made a racial protest while receiving their awards during the playing of the Star Spangled Banner. The Olympic Committiee dismissed them. And Ohio State plays norhwestern today, and USC takes on Washington.
190:28:50 Cunningham: We'll be standing by for the results.
190:28:52 Swigert: Roger. We'll give them to you as soon as they come up.
Long comm break.
190:32:52 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, log the LMP with 25 klicks of water.

190:34:16 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7. Over.
190:34:18 Swigert: Go ahead, Apollo 7.
190:34:21 Cunningham: Roger. Jack, log the LMP with 25 clicks of water, will you?
190:34:25 Swigert: Roger. I copied that before.
190:34:28 Cunningham: Okay. You might tell Virgil True, out at the Hawaii site, that we got a good picture of Hawaii a couple of days ago.
190:34:36 Swigert: Okay. Will do. [Pause]
190:34:42 Schirra: And Louis Wainwright has plenty of pictures of Carnarvon coming. [Pause]
190:34:47 Swigert: Copy that, Wally. [Long pause]
190:35:23 Schirra: Jack, when you have a minute; on those movies Walt was talking about ... [Pause]
190:35:30 Swigert: Wally, I missed that.
190:35:33 Schirra: Roger. On the movies we took on board - [Pause]
190:35:39 Swigert: Lets wait till we get - we're over the Huntsville - let's wait till we get through Guaymas here, and I think you'll be a little clearer.
190:35:48 Schirra: very good. [Long pause]
GUAYMAS through ANTIGUA (REV 120)
190:36:44 Swigert: Apollo 7, how do you read?
190:36:46 Schirra: Very good, Jack.
190:36:48 Swigert: Okay. You are loud and clear now, Wally.
190:36:51 Schirra: The onboard, movies.
190:36:54 Swigert: Okay.
190:36:55 Schirra: Okay.
190:36:56 Swigert: Okay. Copied about the onboard movies.
190:36:58 Schirra: Okay. I want tight clamps put on those until the crew gets to review then.
190:37:04 Swigert: Roger. I have made a special note of that.
190:37:07 Schirra: Very good. I think you can get Pete to back you there. 0n the S0368, the outside pictures of the rendezvous and of the Earth: that's fair game for release. [Pause]
190:37:18 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
190:37:20 Schirra: There may be embarassing - but I don't want people bothering something they don't know anything about all the goodies we took inside. [Pause]
190:37:31 Swigert: I didn't get the last one, Wally.
190:37:34 Schirra: I'm trying to avoid our inside pictures being misunderstood.
190:37:38 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
190:37:40 Schirra: There's nothing embarassing about them. I just want to do them right before they release them.
190:37:43 Swigert: Okay.
190:37:45 Schirra: Very good.

190:38:58 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We are ready to perform the keying test now. [Pause]
190:39:15 Cunningham: Do you want ranging ALIX [garble].
190:39:20 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We are ready for the keying test. [Long pause]
190:39:37 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
190:39:39 Cunningham: [Garble].
190:39:41 Swigert: Okay. Walt, could you put your PMP power to AUX and your S-band normal PCM switch to KEY? Turn up your S-band volume, and we're ready for the keying test.
190:39:54 Cunningham: All done, Jack. I'm ready to key.
190:39:56 Swigert: Okay. Go ahead.
190:39:58 Cunningham: - .... .. ... .- -. ... ---- ..-. . --. .-. --. .-. -.-. - -.- -.-. -.--
190:40:50 Swigert: Okay. You got 100 percent today and you can put your switches back to PCM and NORMAL. [Long pause]
Apollo Control here. That was Walt Cunningham getting 100 percent today on the telegraph keying test which is done with the simple manual depression of the push-to-talk button on his voice communication circuit.
190:41:40 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
190:41:43 Cunningham: Loud and clear.
190:41:44 Swigert: Five-by. You might want to know how well the TV was received this morning. On all three networks, you replaced all the kiddie cartoons. [Pause]
190:41:57 Schirra: (Laughter) This is your Uncle Don. [Pause]
190:42:05 Schirra: As I recall, kiddie cartoons are on all three networks, though.
190:42:08 Swigert: That's right; you replaced all three - all the kiddie cartoons on all three networks.
190:42:14 Schirra: That's pretty strong.
Comm break.
You heard Wally Schirra being advised that he had preempted all the kiddie cartoons in the Saturday morning network, and they seemed to enjoy that tremendously.
GUAYMAS tbrough ANTIGUA (REV 121)
190:45:08 Cunningham: Frame 38, magazine R, is Dallas and frame 39 is the Mississipi River looking north. [Pause]
190:45:17 Swigert: Okay. [Pause]
190:45:22 Cunningham: Forty is New Orleans, again.
190:45:24 Swigert: Okay. [Long pause]
Walt Cunningham is popping pictures like an airborn tourist. Said he got a shot of Dallas, several of New Orleans, one looking up the Mississippi River towards St. Louis and Memphis.
190:45:57 Cunningham: Forty was New Orleans; 41, Mobile.
190:46:01 Swigert: Copy. [Pause]
190:46:09 Schirra: Is that hurricane still working?
190:46:12 Swigert: Roger. Wally, it's inland now.
190:46:17 Schirra: Yes, we have it in sight. [Pause]
190:46:27 Swigert: It looks like it's in the northeastern corner of Florida, and it's heading - it looks like about 04 or 05 degrees.
190:46:36 Schirra: We've got an eyeball on it ...
190:46:37 Cunningham: We can tell you where it is probably better.
190:46:40 Swigert: I think you probably can. [Long pause]
190:46:57 Schirra: It's pretty far north; I don't think there's much sence in giving you a mark on it.
190:47:01 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
190:47:12 Schirra: Frame 42 is Gladys.
190:47:16 Swigert: Copy.
190:47:18 Schirra: It's getting a lot bigger, but not as violent, I gather. [Pause]
190:47:27 Swigert: Wally, it's got 60 knots now, and it's supposed to increase as it goes out into the Atlantic.
190:47:32 Schirra: Ah, ha.
190:47:35 Cunningham: I assume that's well north of our track for 264-1?
190:47:41 Swigert: Affirm. We are really plotting that carefully.
190:47:44 Schirra: Well, we are on our track right now, aren't we - for 264-1?
190:47:48 Schirra: Roughly? [Pause]
190:47:55 Swigert: Wally, 164-1 would have been a previous rev there. [Pause]
190:48:01 Schirra: So we're well south, yes?
190:48:03 Swigert: Roger.
190:48:05 Schirra: I've got 260's on my mind, I guess.
190:48:08 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
190:48:12 Schirra: We're trying to figure out whether we passed the duration of Gemini V jet. [Pause]
190:48:21 Swigert: We're gonna look that up. [Pause]
190:48:28 Cunningham: How about a map update, Jack?
190:48:32 Swigert: In work. [Long pause]
190:48:50 Swigert: Okay. Walt, for REV 123: GET on the node 194 plus 50 plus 26, longitude will be 100.8 degrees east. [Pause]
190:49:13 Schirra: Jack, we had an interesting picture of Dallas. Two aircraft apparently going over Dallas at six, and the contrails formed a wide open "V". [Pause]
190:49:24 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
190:49:27 Cunningham: What was the time of that last map update - time?
190:49:30 Swigert: Okay. 194 plus 50 plus 26. [Long pause]
190:50:06 Swigert: Wally, I'll give you a mark when you exceed Gemini V. It's about 5 minutes from now.
190:50:12 Schirra: Very good. [Long pause]
190:50:26 Slayton: You guys wouldn't want to try for Gemini VII would you?
190:50:29 Schirra: Negative. Negative. Is that Deke?
190:50:32 Slayton: Yes.
190:50:34 Schirra: Did yon get my story on the movies, Deke?
190:50:37 Slayton: Negative. Jack is going to brief me on it now.
190:50:40 Schirra: Very good. Sounds like you have a cold.
190:50:42 Slayton: Yes, either you've got mine or vice versa. [Pause]
190:50:46 Schirra: (Laughter)
190:50:48 Cunningham: We got six blocked ears up here.
190:50:51 Schirra: I'd like to have you talk to the guys about that reentry mode, Deke. [Pause]
190:50:59 Slayton: Roger. We've been discussing that one.
190:51:02 Schirra: Very good. We're still pretty well stuffed up; I think the risk is greater on the ears than it is on the - no suits. We rehearsed in the couches this morning with the inflight coveralls, and we will wear our COMM carriers, of course; and we pitched down very vell.
190:51:23 Slayton: Very good. I still think we would probably like to get the suit donning test at least some place along here.
190:51:28 Schirra: I accept that, yes. We are really worried about our ears because of the - the problem getting the helmets off; then we really expect - big neck rings.
190:51:36 Slayton: Roger.
Comm break.
You heard Deke Slayton trading some good morning comments with the crew commander, and in the course of which it develops, Schirra would prefer - at least it sounded like he would prefer a coverall reentry opposed to the spacesuit reentry. There is feeling here in the control center, that at very least, we should do a quick don test. Here is more comm.
190:52:40 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
190:52:42 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
190:52:43 Schirra: Far as we can tell, this [garble] emergency radiator's working - you can call it secondary if you want. Should be no constraint for the next mission. [Long pause]
190:53:02 Swigert: Roger. We agree there.
190:53:05 Schirra: Our VERBS are coming very well.
190:53:10 Swigert: It sure looked like from down here watching the data.
190:53:13 Schirra: Good. [Pause]
190:53:19 Cunningham: We've actually been cooler because the evaporator has been running more and controlling the lower glycol temperature.
190:53:26 Swigert: Roger. Copy that. [Pause]
190:53:33 Schirra: According to the update computer, the update took us about 5 minutes [garble]. [Pause]
190:53:46 Swigert: 7, opposite omni. We didn't copy that last one, Wally.
190:53:50 Schirra: The computer: it took us about 5 minutes just to update it.
190:53:56 Swigert: Okay. We got that. Walt, when you bring the primary evaporator back on the line here, we would, like to have you open the hack pressure valve for 2 seconds, monitor the steam pressure in the EVAP OUT temperature for 30 seconds, then go to AUTO.
190:54:16 Cunningham: Wilco. [Long pause]
190:54:53 Swigert: Walt, can you confirm you PMP power switch in NORMAL? [Pause]
190:55:01 Cunningham: Okay. [Long pause]
190:55:20 Swigert: Apollo 7.
190:55:21 Swigert: MARK.
190:55:22 Swigert: You're now flying longer than Gemini VIII.
190:55:26 Schirra: Roger. I guess we got 2 more man hours; that will take over 9 days. And I'm not sure how our compatriots stack up for total man hours. [Pause]
190:55:40 Swigert: Roger. Copy that. I made a mistake; that's Gemini V; I said GeminiV III.
190:55:46 Schirra: No contest.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, 190 hours, 56 minutes and 55 seconds into the flight. This now is the second longest spaceflight in history. You heard one of the more talkative passes between Apollo 7 and this Control Center. The one just finished. One of the transmissions that might not have been fully understood because of some keying, was a comment from Schirra and backed up by some additional statements from Eisele to the effect that the emergency coolant loop was working very well. Eisele - Schirra noted that it should pose no constraint to the next mission, Apollo 8. If anything Eisele said, it's providing more cooling. All in all, they are very happy with that. The total number of hours to do some further arithmetic means that the United States now has nearly 2600 hours of manned spaceflight time. Even closer would be 2570. Add 190 hours, 57 minutes into this flight. This is Apollo Control, Houston.

191:09:17 Cunningham: Roger. Eighteen. And you have got an echo on that one. [Pause]
191:09:24 Cunningham: Who is UCLA playing today, Jack?
191:09:27 Swigert: Stand by. [Pause]
191:09:32 Schirra: Check Standford, too, please.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston with 191 hours, 15 minutes into the flight. And it is that time in the flight when statisticians start combing the records books and doing comparisons with other flights. Several have been passed to us. For instance, this flight, if it goes the full duration, will exceed even Gemini 7's total manned hours logged. Gemini 7, in duration, was 14 days, of course, but with two men aboard, Frank Borman and Jim Lovell. Their total inflight time was something on the order of 660 hours. This flight, with three men aboard, going 260 hours, would give us a total of about 780 hours. We have already noted the fact that it has surpassed Gemini 5's total time in flight, to become second in longest duration in space flight. And another item worth noting, perhaps, is this flight alone has already exceeded all of the Russian manned flight time manned experience in all of their various spacecraft. We, according to our records, we totaled that out at 532 hours and these three men are now - have something better than 570 hours. Via Ascension, we had this brief communication.
Apollo Control back here and we should acquire via Tananarive just any moment here. We should pick up in 30 seconds. Donn Eisele has gone to sleep according to the flight plan and according to the communications for the last 1/2 hour. That is a believable flight plan item. The BIOMED harness has been switched over to Walt Cunningham. According to flight plan, shortly after we pass Tananarive, the spacecraft will go into another night cycle and the crew will power up their onboard computer. We would assume that Walt Cunningham will be down there manning the navigation station. The usual navigator, Donn Eisele, is getting his rest. Still nothing via Tananarive. We will come back to you when the station has acquired. It is questionable whether we will get com, but if we do, we will be back to you.

Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, 191 hours, 20 minutes. Jack Swigert is about to put in a call to Apollo 7. I think he is going to pass on to them some more football games. We got some queries wondering who UCLA would play today. Walt Cunningham's a graduate of that August institution and for the record, they're playing California. We thought we got a query on Navy as well. We'll standby for this first call going out through Tananarive.
Apollo Control here, apparently we are not going to try to reach the spacecraft through Tananarive. We will take the line down and come back to you, if by chance we get in touch by the ARIA airplanes over the Indian Ocean or certainly we'll get around to Carnarvon in about 15 minutes. At 191 hours, 23 minutes, Apollo Control.

CARNARVON (REV 121)
191:33:57 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
191:34:02 Cunningham: Roger, Jack. Hey, Jack, I'd like to make note of something. I've noticed on numerous occasions since the beginning of the flight that we can see, quite plainly, the Magellanic clouds in the southern latitudes.
191:34:20 Swigert: Roger. Copy that.
191:34:23 Cunningham: I don't believe they have ever been spotted up here before.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 191 hours, 34 minutes into the flight. We have tagged up with Apollo 7 through Carnarvon and an interesting conversation developed immediately. Walt Cunningham noted that the crew repeatedly had been able to see the Magellanic clouds, the clouds named for the explorer Magellan, which are prominent in the southern hemisphere and he said they had been able to see them before repeatedly. He said as far as he could recall, he didn't remember any other crews that had reported them. I think that would bear some checking, it seems to me that Gemini 7 saw those clouds, reported seeing them. One of the Gemini crews was given the specific task to look for them. Let's turn on the conversation now, as it is developing on the coast of Australia.
191:34:26 Swigert: Okay. Walt we have got a NAV vector we would like to send you, and if you will go to ACCEPT - and also I have a NAV check for you. [Pause]
191:34:38 Schirra: We got to get the computer up first.
191:34:40 Swigert: Oh, man, I thought you were powered up.
191:34:44 Schirra: We will bring it shortly. [Pause]
191:34:49 Cunningham: I'll copy the PAD reference. Go ahead, what is it?
191:34:52 Swigert: Okay. The NAV check PAD, the time, 193 plus 10 plus 0000 minus 1829 plus 09189 2400. [Pause]
191:35:20 Cunningham: Roger. Say again the time, please.
191:35:23 Swigert: Roger. 193 plus 10 plus four balls. [Pause]
191:35:32 Cunningham: 193 100000 minus 1829 plus 09189 2400. Over.
191:35:39 Swigert: Roger. That is correct, Walt. [Long pause]
191:36:15 Cunningham: We might not be able to get state vector in the computer until the next station, Jack.
Comm break.
191:37:27 Swigert: Hey, Wait, could you reverify the NAV check time you read back to me? [Long pause]
191:37:49 Swigert: Apollo 7, opposite omni. [Long pause]
191:38:37 Cunningham: - In P00; now waiting to catch up the state vector.
191:38:41 Swigert: Roger. Stand by. [Long pause]
191:39:18 Cunningham: Okay. Jack, are you going to have time to send the state vector up?
191:39:22 Swigert: Roger, Walt. We've got about 4 and 1/2 minutes left here with you at Carnarvon. [Pause]
191:39:27 Schirra: Okay. We are in ACCEPT. Send your message. [Pause]
191:39:31 Swigert: Coming up. [Long pause]
191:39:47 Swigert: And, Walt, I have a T align time here for P54 to give you. [Pause]
191:39:54 Cunningham: Roger. Go ahead.
191:39:56 Swigert: Roger. That's 193 plus 40. That is the T align for P54. We would not like you to key in this time prior to performing P53, though. [Pause]
191:40:10 Cunningham: Roger. Will load 193 plus 40 plus 00 after performing P53?
191:40:15 Swigert: Copy that. [Pause]
191:40:21 Swigert: And, Walt, did you get the flight plan update to perform P52 IMU realign option 3 after the P54? [Pause]
191:40:33 Cunningham: Affirmative.
191:40:34 Swigert: Okay. Could you record the star angle differences and the gyro torquing angles for us?
191:40:39 Cunningham: Wilco.
191:40:40 Swigert: Thank you.
191:40:41 Cunningham: On the P52.
191:40:45 Swigert: 7, the NAV update is finished; the computer is yours.
Comm break.
191:41:50 Cunningham: NAV ...
191:41:53 Swigert: Go ahead, 7. [Long pause]
191:42:04 Cunningham: NAV check is GO.
191:42:05 Swigert: Roger. We verify. [Pause]
191:42:16 Swigert: Walt, can you confirm that inverter 3 is now off?
191:42:22 Cunningham: No, I'm going to turn it off. [Pause]
191:42:32 Cunningham: Okay. Everything else is back in configuration, as before the secondary cold loop test. The primary evaporator did cycle down and operate for while.
191:42:42 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
191:42:44 Cunningham: Do you want to leave the primary evaporator on the line? [Pause]
191:42:51 Swigert: Affirmative, Walt.
191:42:54 Cunningham: Okay. It will probably end up drying out again.
191:42:56 Swigert: Okay. We are about 1 minute LOS Carnarvon here. We pick you up at Guam - well, we won't get you there at Guam. It's too short a pass. We will pick you up at Hawaii on the hour.
191:43:11 Cunningham: Okay. And you notice that fuel cell 2 seems to have stabilized out right at the caution and warning trigger line.
191:43:19 Swigert: Roger. We are following that real close.
Long comm break.
That will wrap up the conversation by Carnarvon. At 191 hours, 43 minutes, Apollo Control.
