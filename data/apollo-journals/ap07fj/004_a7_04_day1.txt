Comms through Ascension. Rev-3
003:31:01 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Pause.]
003:31:05 Schirra: Go ahead, Houston.
003:31:07 Swigert: Roger. We're standing by for your PPO2 reading. [Long pause.]
003:31:24 Schirra: Roger. Our PPO2 is reading 18 - oh, about 182 - 180, I guess. [Pause.]
003:31:30 Swigert: Roger. Copy 182. Apollo 7, Houston. Could you read us out your reading for cabin pressure? [Long pause.]
003:32:01 Schirra: Roger. Cabin pressure is down to 5.2, I'd say - something like that. [Pause.]
003:32:08 Swigert: Okay. Copy. Thank you.
Very long comm break.
Comms through Tananarive. Rev-3
003:47:12 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by. [Long pause.]
003:47:40 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
Very long comm break.
We have been trying - Capsule Communicator Jack Swigert has been trying to reach Apollo 7 remoting through Tananarive without success, we apparently have some problem as yet not resolved through that Tananarive Station and we've had some other communications problems on the the circuit, these are not unusual and we feel very confident in a rev or two we'll figure out the right combinations of antennas and switches and be up to speed in all stations around the Earth. The crew during this period as they move across the Indian Ocean will let us check the Flight Plan here. They're coming in to a sunset - or their in the night - they are in darkness. Donn Eisele is down in the Lower Equipment Bay at his G&N station and they'll be checking electrical voltages very carefully and reporting to them on those checks over Australia and that looks like about the extent of the activity for now. We should hear from them when they come into range of Carnarvon at 4 hours and 5 minutes into the mission. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
Comms through Carnarvon. Rev-3
004:02:29 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
004:02:32 Cunningham: Roger. Loud and clear.
004:02:34 Swigert: You are loud and clear, also.
004:02:36 Cunningham: Houston, this is Apollo 7. I checked converter 3 on main B is AC bus 2; all phases normal. I checked converter 3 on main A, AC 1; all phases normal. To commence the ECS redundant component check, we need your cooperation for the manifold pressure readout. [Long pause.]
004:02:58 Swigert: Roger. We copy. [Long pause.]
004:03:20 Cunningham: If you are ready on the ground, we are going to start checking our main regulator. [Pause.]
004:03:27 Swigert: Okay. Apollo 7, Houston. We are ready to copy. [Long pause.]
004:03:38 Cunningham: Main regulator D valve, Closed. Emergency cabin pressure valve to one. Emergency cabin push-to-test pushbutton, Push. O2 Flow vent, Hi. Can you give us a reading on the manifold pressure? [Long pause.]
004:04:10 Swigert: Roger. 105.
004:04:13 Cunningham: Thank you. Main regulator D valve, Open; main regulator A valve, Closed. Emergency cabin pressure valve to 2. Emergeney cabin push-to-test pushbutton, Push. Okay. It's working. How about a readout on this one? [Long pause.]
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 4 hours, 4 minutes into the flight. We are in touch with Apollo via Carnarvon and Walt Cunningham is going through the circuit breaker check with us to the pyrotechnic lines. We will tune in on the conversation now.
004:04:36 Swigert: 104.
004:04:38 Cunningham: Roger. 104. Main regulator A valve, Open, Donn. [Pause.]
004:04:43 Eisele: Roger.
004:04:44 Cunningham: Emergency cabin valve, Closed. [Long pause.]
004:04:56 Eisele: And we intend to [garble] our secondary radiators when we get that far on this list. [Pause.]
004:05:02 Swigert: Roger. Copy. [Pause.]
004:05:06 Schirra: We went a long period of time here vith tape voice and data phone. I think it would be good if we go over the horizon, and you don't get that thing back into an operating mode; let us know if you can. [Long pause.]
004:05:19 Swigert: Roger. [Pause.]
004:05:26 Schirra: We're absolutely counting on being able to record this data on the tape. [Pause.]
004:05:31 Swigert: Okay. [Long pause.]
004:06:13 Swigert: Okay. Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause.]
004:06:17 Schirra: Go.
004:06:18 Swigert: Roger. We're not going to be able to finish the dump here over Carnarvon, so you'll still be barber pole to Hawaii. We'll finish the dump at Hawaii then. [Long pause.]
004:06:31 Schirra: Roger. Understand. And in some cases, it would seem that it would be desirable for us to go ahead and hit Command Reset and get that tape moving forward. So in order to avoid any confusion in dumping or in writing all this stuff you haven't dumped, please let us know. [Long pause.]
004:06:46 Swigert: Okay. Will do. [Long pause.]
004:07:03 Swigert: Apollo 7, we're standing by for your Pyro A and B volts checks. [Pause.]
004:07:10 Schirra: Roger. We've pulled the circuit breaker; it was reading 37 volts before we pulled each one. [Pause.]
004:07:15 Swigert: Okay. Batt C voltage. [Pause.]
004:07:20 Schirra: Pyro A, 37; Pyro B, 37; and Pyro A sequence A and Pyro B sequence B circuit breakers are out. [Pause.]
004:07:27 Swigert: Okay. Batt C voltage. [Pause.]
004:07:32 Schirra: Batt C's reading 37. Do you read 37? [Pause.]
004:07:40 Swigert: All right; understand. Inverter phase voltages. [Pause.]
004:07:45 Unknown crewman: All inverter phase voltages are nominal. I will call nominal at 115 plus or minus 2. [Pause.]
004:07:50 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
004:07:52 Schirra: Redundant inverter phase voltages all nominal also.
004:07:55 Swigert: Okay.
Comm break.
004:10:06 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Carnarvon, and we have ARIA coverage here for another 10 minutes. [Pause.]
004:10:15 Schirra: Roger. We are Go here. [Long pause.]
004:11:00 Swigert: ARIA 3, go Remote. [Long pause.]
004:11:25 Communications technician: ARIA 3, ARIA 3. [garble] [Pause.]
004:11:32 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 3. [Long pause.]
004:11:48 Swigert: Apollo 7, through - Houston through ARIA. [Long pause.]
004:12:27 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA. Standing by. [Long pause.]
004:13:24 Swigert: ARIA 3 to [garble]. [Long pause.]
004:13:44 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 3.
Comm break.
004:15:00 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 1. Standing by. [Long pause.]
004:15:17 ARIA 1: [Garble] [Long pause.]
004:15:35 ARIA 3: ARIA [Garble]
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control at Houston. Apparently not much luck through the ARIA aircraft North of Australia so we will take a line down at this time. The crew we should next hear from the crew when they reach Hawaii at 4 hours and 30 minutes into the flight and at that time they will conduct a bias check on something called the PIPA, the P I P A. PIPA stands for the Pulsed Integrating Pendulous Accelerometer. I hope everybody copied that. It is a part of the guidance system and related to platform kinds of drift in past space flights. At least the check they will perform is that sort of check over Hawaii and on across the States. At 4 hours and 15 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
004:17:06 Swigert: ARIA 3 [Garble]
Very long comm break.
HAWAII (REV 3)
004:28:32 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston CAPCOM through Hawaii. [Pause.]
004:28:40 Schirra: Roger. Houston.
004:28:43 Swigert: We're standing by.
004:28:45 Schirra: Aloha.
004:28:48 Swigert: Aloha. Reading you loud and clear. [Long pause.]
004:29:01 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
004:29:04 Schirra: Go ahead, Thomas.
004:29:05 Swigert: Roger. Reading you loud and clear here. How's everything going? [Pause.]
004:29:10 Schirra: Very good. We're finishing off our first meal; I've had my first space cup of coffee. [Pause.]
004:29:15 Swigert: You're eating the breakfast drink?
004:29:18 Schirra: They can't take it away from me, now.
004:29:21 Swigert: Roger. Okay. Over the States this time, you're going to get the NAV load, the state vector load, and also the REFSMMAT. [Pause.]
004:29:30 Schirra: Roger. [Pause.]
004:29:34 Swigert: Later on, then, we'll call you up a maneuver pad for the 5 dash 4 maneuver, for NAV check, and also for data for that DTO on the day-night retro cheek. [Pause.]
004:29:44 Schirra: Very good.
Long comm break.
004:35:08 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Forty seconds to LOS. We will have a - about a 3-minute loss of COMM here since the Huntsville lost the voice. We will pick you up over California about 38. [Long pause.]
004:35:23 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause.]
SC: Roger.
HTV: Houston CapCom, Huntsville.
Swigert: Go ahead.
HTV: [Garble] we believe we have voice back.
Swigert: Try remoting VHF? I don't - I don't ...
HTV: Would you try contacting the capsule VHF?
Swigert: Okay. Well I transmit simultaneously.
HUNTSVILLE through ANTICUA (REV 3)
004:36:23 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston CapCom through to Huntsville. How do you read? [Long pause.]
004:37:16 Cunningham: We can read you S-band. Go ahead.
004:37:19 Swigert: Okay. Five-by, Walt. We just wanted to make a voice check through Huntsville. [Pause.]
004:37:27 Cunningham: Okay. Jack, if we have made all of these good voice checks, I would like to catch up here a little bit on our food. [Pause.]
004:37:33 Swigert: Sure.
Comm break.
004:40:30 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. If you will go to uplink to Accept, we will give you - send you the state vector target load and REFSMAT. [Long pause.]
004:40:57 Schirra: Houston, check. [Pause.]
004:41:01 Swigert: Roger. We got it. Coming up. [Long pause.]
004:41:28 Schirra: Ready to copy the maneuver PAD whenever you have it. [Pause.]
004:41:32 Swigert: I don't.
004:41:33 Swigert: I don't have it yet, Walt. Stand by. [Long pause.]
004:41:45 Cunningham: Jack, you can tell Chuck Arthur we've got a washer for him. [Pause.]
004:41:49 Swigert: Say again. [Pause.]
004:41:58 Swigert: Okay. I understand you have a washer for him.
004:42:00 Cunningham: That's correct. We got some for Huey, Peters, and Cochran. [Pause.]
004:42:09 Swigert: Okay. [Long pause.]
004:42:26 Cunningham: We'll try to give you some more back. [Long pause.]
004:42:55 Swigert: Okay.
004:42:57 Cunningham: You understand they did the tumble test in the Plan? [Pause.]
004:43:03 Swigert: Roger.
Comm break.
004:44:50 Schirra: Magazine XXX Frame 50. [Pause.]
HUNTSVILLE through ANTIGUA (REV 4)
004:45:00 Schirra: Houston, at this time, at 004:44:32, we have shot frame 50 on S0368 magazine M. [Long pause.]
004:45:17 Swigert: Okay. [Pause.]
004:45:21 Schirra: We had to call those out to you in real time; we can't record right now.
004:45:24 Swigert: All right. [Long pause.]
004:45:43 Schirra: Houston, for the EMS bias check, add 1.6 feet per second in 5 minutes. Over. [Long pause.]
004:45:54 Swigert: Roger. How many feet per second in 5 minutes, Wally?
004:45:57 Schirra: [Garble] six.
004:46:00 Swigert: Roger. Understand, six.
004:46:03 Schirra: Negative. Unity six.
004:46:05 Swigert: Roger. Got it. [Pause.]
004:46:12 Schirra: That's on the DELTA-V time.
004:46:14 Swigert: Roger, Wally. [Long pause.]
004:46:53 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. All three NAV loads are in and verified. We are ready to pass up your maneuver PAD. [Long pause.]
004:47:07 Schirra: Ready to copy. Go.
004:47:08 Swigert: Okay. 6 dash 4 008 59 0843 minus 03194 plus all balls plus 03953 1530 minus 0370 04970 32460 minus 086 minus 0300 plus 24 45 3590 332 008 17 all balls minus 2687 minus 03376 1631 180 180 000.
Comm break.
004:48:23 Schirra: Roger. Do you still read, Houston?
004:48:24 Swigert: I read you five-by.
004:48:25 Schirra: Okay. Readback follows: 6 dash 4 008 59 0843 minus 03194 plus five ball plus 03953 1530 minus 0370 04970 32460 minus 086 minus 030 024 45 3590 332 008 17 0000 minus 2687 minus 03776 1631 180 180 000. Over. [Long pause.]
004:49:07 Swigert: Roger. There's a correction on your Noun 43 longitude; that should be minus 03376. [Long pause.]
004:49:18 Schirra: Minus 03376. Roger.
004:49:21 Swigert: Okay. And I'm ready on your manual retro attitude update. [Pause.]
004:49:26 Schirra: Send 'em up. [Pause.]
004:49:34 Swigert: On your remarks, Walt: for your six dash four update there, star check is not visible after 08 plus 40 plus 00. [Long pause.]
004:49:49 Schirra: Roger. 08 40 00 before then. [Pause.]
004:49:54 Swigert: Roger. [Pause.]
004:49:59 Swigert: And let me know when you're ready to copy that S 20.9 manuat retro update. [Pause.]
004:50:04 Schirra: Ready to copy. Go.
004:50:05 Swigert: Okay. Read the - from top to bottom 6 plus 10, 6 plus 50; roll 179-180, pitch 138-341, yaw 360-359. The first one is a day; second one is a night. [Long pause.]
004:50:35 Schirra: Okay. Now I'll read back right across the top line: 6 plus 10, roll 179, pitch 138, yaw 360 day; second one is 6 plus 50, roll 180, pitch 241, yaw 359, night. Over. [Long pause.]
004:50:52 Swigert: Roger. That's got it. [Long pause.]
004:51:38 Swigert: Apolll 7, the phasing maneuver that we did will put us 82 miles in front tomorrow for the rendezvous. [Pause.]
004:51:47 Schirra: Roger. I understand. Eighty miles in front tomorrow.
004:51:49 Swigert: Eighty-two.
004:51:50 Schirra: Eighty-two miles.
Comm break.
004:53:01 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
004:53:03 Swigert: Go ahead.
004:53:04 Schirra: You've had a report on our constellation Orion already, have you not? [Pause.]
004:53:10 Swigert: No, I've had no affirmative report.
004:53:13 Schirra: No strain; it worked well.
004:53:15 Swigert: Okay. Real fine.
004:53:17 Schirra: [Garble].
004:53:19 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause.]
004:53:33 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
004:53:34 Schirra: Go ahead.
004:53:35 Swigert: Roger. G&N say we are getting close to gimbal lock. [Pause.]
004:53:39 Schirra: We have an eyeball on it. [Long pause.]
004:54:05 Schirra: We don't seem to be generating any IVA maneuvers that the spacecraft's responding to. [Pause.]
004:54:12 Swigert: Roger, Wally. One thing we're interested in: how is Donn doing down in the LEB with respect to working the NAV gear? Do you have any trouble for a position? [Pause.]
004:54:20 Schirra: At about two GDI's, that's all. [Pause.]
004:54:25 Swigert: Understand, 13.
004:54:28 Schirra: The floor doesn't seem to hold me down very well, and it may be because of the strip that's in the hose that keeps carrying me toward the other end; so I'll find out a little better, I think, after I get the suit off later, if I do that. [Long pause.]
004:54:40 Swigert: Okay.
004:54:41 Schirra: And the PPO2: I gave that to you at 04:40, and it was 165. [Pause.]
004:54:47 Swigert: Roger. We copied that. What about the PIPA bias check? [Pause.]
004:54:53 Schirra: We had to stop that when we took your update; we'll start another one shortly.
004:54:56 Swigert: Okay. Real fine.
004:54:58 Schirra: Good. [Pause.]
004:55:08 Schirra: For your information, we have finished one meal. [Pause.]
004:55:13 Swigert: Copy. One meal.
Comm break.
004:57:44 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Long pause.]
004:58:19 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We are through with the computer; you can go to BLOCK on the UPTEL switch if you'd like. [Pause.]
004:58:25 Schirra: Roger. BLOCK. [Pause.]
004:58:34 Swigert: Schirra: We're doing our secondary coolant loop cheek now. *** Schirra:
004:58:37 Swigert: Okay. [Long pause.]
004:59:20 Swigert: You're about 30 seconds from LOS; we will pick you up over Ascension in about 6 minutes.
Long comm break.
004:59:30 Unknown crewman (onboard): Yes, yes, I get it [garble].
004:59:37 Schirra (onboard): Well, we'll have to go up to 270. Is that going to pulse you too much?
004:59:47 Eisele (onboard): Will you pull the handle again? Oh, you're working right there.
004:59:57 Eisele (onboard): Glycol radiator secondary ...
005:00:00 Cunningham (onboard): To NORMAL.
005:00:02 Eisele (onboard): ... to NORMAL.
005:00:04 Eisele (onboard): Okay, it's NORMAL, Walt. Anything else down under here? No, I guess not. Okay. Huh?
005:00:20 Eisele (onboard): We can put it back to BYPASS? Oh, I see. Okay, well, okay, it passes the test. See what it does, Walt? Watch. If I put it in AUTO - but if I do it this way, then in AUTO, it's allright. See the deal? You move the switch around STANDBY.
005:01:15 Eisele (onboard): Look at that. Boy!
005:01:50 Eisele (onboard): Where is it? Oh, right here.
005:02:01 Eisele (onboard): Very good.
005:02:05 Schirra (onboard): I have an idea that those damn things are winding us up in yaw. You know it?
005:02:15 Eisele (onboard): What's that, Wally?
005:02:16 Schirra (onboard): The evaporators. They completely move in yaw.
005:02:24 Eisele (onboard): Well, they probably are a little bit then.
005:02:31 Eisele (onboard): Yes. I picked it out once.
005:02:50 Eisele (onboard): Boy, this window is getting smudgy. Look at this one.
005:02:56 Schirra (onboard): Yes, look at the moisture on it.
005:02:58 Eisele (onboard): And it was so good, too. That's gone to pot fast.
005:03:04 Eisele (onboard): Now's the time to take a picture of something like that. That's what we're looking for.
005:03:11 Schirra (onboard): Yes, want to give me the - oh ...
005:03:20 Schirra (onboard): Yes.
005:03:37 Schirra (onboard): You what?
005:04:08 Eisele (onboard): Something's gone wrong here.
005:04:09 Schirra (onboard): Yes.
005:04:14 Eisele (onboard): No.
005:04:28 Schirra (onboard): See those lines on it? Can you see it? Way down on the bottom, it's almost terrible. It's bubbly.
005:04:40 Schirra (onboard): Moisture ...
005:04:50 Schirra (onboard): We have the - you're recording that? Okay, that's frame 52 and 53 of the centerline window - of the hatch window, that is - at 5 hours 5 minutes on magazine M as in Mike. The center window is picking up quite a bit of visible moisture, and it looks like on the outer pane - the inner surface of the outer pane.
005:05:42 Cunningham (onboard): Okay, we've closed the secondary glycol loop, now [garble] it's flowing the radiator. Secondary radiator inlet temperature is reading about 72. Secondary radiator outlet temperature is reading 60. I verify that the heaters did come on when I turned the secondary heaters on, and I'm judging now with the high radiator outlet temperature, I turned the - cycled the secondary heaters ON and OFF and had no change of current, so apparently it came ON and was immediately shut OFF by the LOGIC in the secondary radiator loop. When I turned the secondary coolant loop pump to AC 1, in the EVAP mode, the glycol evaporator outlet temperature came down, overshot the control range, went down to about 35, the steam pressure went down to less than 0.1 and came back up in about 50 seconds and stabilized out. The glycol evaporator outlet temperature is about 40 and about 0.12 on the steam pressure.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 5 hours, 6 minutes into the flight. The Flight Director suspects the crew is involved with other matters and has decided we will not attempt to contact them by voice communications which have not been the best through Tananarive today at this point. We are on the fourth revolution around the Earth and all events proceeding very well at this time. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
005:07:11 Schirra (onboard): How long do you have to watch that beauty, Donn?
005:07:16 Eisele (onboard): I'm done for now. Do you want it back?
005:07:21 Schirra (onboard): No, no! Just curious.
005:07:27 Eisele (onboard): Can't understand that.
005:07:29 Schirra (onboard): Yes.
005:07:41 Eisele (onboard): You know that temperature really goes up.
005:07:46 Cunningham (onboard): We'll have to do a tenth of a degree per second from zero.
005:07:50 Schirra (onboard): Is that right?
005:07:51 Eisele (onboard): Yes.
ASCENSION (REV 4)
005:07:52 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. Standing by. [Pause.]
005:07:57 Schirra: Roger. We're noticing a little bit of fogging on the hatch window. [Pause.]
005:08:06 Swigert: Roger. Copied.
005:08:07 Schirra: And we've taken a couple of pictures of it. [Long pause.]
005:08:12 Eisele (onboard): What about the other windows?
005:08:13 Schirra (onboard): The other windows are apparently alright.
005:08:15 Eisele (onboard): The hatch is the only one that's ...
005:08:17 Schirra (onboard): Yes, they said they ...
005:08:19 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
005:08:21 Cunningham: We've closed the secondary radiators, and the temperature came down right smartly. We've turned on the secondary coolant loop pump and EVAP, and the glycol EVAP outlet temperature came right on down, overshot to about 35, and seems to be controlling around 40, and the steam pressure is 0.12. [Long pause.]
005:08:42 Swigert: That sounds real good, Walt. [Pause.]
005:08:48 Schirra: The fogging on the center hatch window is on the inner surface of the outer pane. It looks like a condensation. [Long pause.]
005:09:00 Eisele: Checking condensation. [Long pause.]
005:09:12 Eisele (onboard): Yes. Yes.
005:09:22 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, I have one anomalous thing here. When we flowed the secondary loop, the primary RAD OUT temperature is sitting about, well, call it 55, make it 65, and the glycol EVAP outlet temperature climbed right on up to about 58 - something llke that. Makes you wonder about the mixing valve working. [Long pause.]
005:09:48 Swigert: Roger.
Long comm break.
005:09:52 Schirra (onboard): We're coming up on a night pass, Donn. That's a P52 IMU realign.
005:09:59 Eisele (onboard): Okay. Walt, I don't know which one it is offhand. Is it on the coolant panel? Is that the one you're talking about?
005:10:06 Eisele (onboard): Well, I don't - there isn't any labeled mixing valve. Which - what would it be?
005:10:11 Cunningham (onboard): [Garble]
005:10:12 Eisele (onboard): Gly - primary glycol EVAP TEMP IN?
005:10:14 Cunningham (onboard): [Garble]
005:10:19 Eisele (onboard): Well, there isn't anything, it just says ...
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 5 hours, 11 minutes into the flight. We have some tape backed up from the last stateside pass beginning out in Hawaii. It was a fairly quiet pass as the crew was eating its first meal in space, but in the course of the pass, Schirra commented that he had - had the - that he had chalked up the - had his first cup of coffee in space. In this particular spacecraft we have water available which is as warm as 150 degrees and Wally insisted on taking some coffee along on the flight, and of course he had to squeeze it into a bag and I am sure it wasn't the easiest thing to drink but he indicated that it was very enjoyable. The crew completed their first meal in the course of the pass and the current orbital numbers read like this: 165 nautical miles by 124 nautical miles. That is as a result of the initial maneuver by the Command Module and the Command Module presently is leading is slightly below the S-IVB. It is about 15 miles separation distance between the two and that is growing - that is growing at a small rate but over a period of perhaps 8 to 10, 12 hours the two will be separated by about 100 miles. Again the orbital numbers are 165 miles by 124. Both nautical readings. Schirra did report that their IVA maneuvers - that is, their moving about the crew movements within the spacecraft changing couches, Donn Eisele moving down to his station in the Lower Equipment Bay did not seem to be generating any change - Delta V kinds of changes within the spacecraft. In other words it wasn't accounting for any great bias or accelerations or deviations from their plotted flight path. As I said, we have got about 10 minutes of tape backed up and we will play it for you now.
005:13:08 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. About 40 seconds to LOS Ascension; we'll pick you up in about 18 minutes over Carnarvon. [Long pause.]
005:13:20 Schirra: Roger.
Very long comm break.
005:13:25 Eisele (onboard): Well, there come some stars.
005:13:27 Schirra (onboard): Well, will you do the stars [garble]
005:13:30 Eisele (onboard): Hey!
005:13:32 Schirra (onboard): Come on, come - are you moving?
005:13:33 Cunningham (onboard): A little bit.
005:13:35 Eisele (onboard): I'm going to have to get dark adapted here.
005:13:42 Cunningham (onboard): What about the [garble]?
005:13:43 Schirra (onboard): I did that.
005:13:45 Cunningham (onboard): You did?
005:13:47 Eisele (onboard): Man, I sure - I've been looking at a bright light too long. I'm having a hell of a time adjusting ...
005:13:50 Cunningham (onboard): Better watch it, better watch it!
005:13:59 Eisele (onboard): Wally, I'm going to do something which will torque your ball around. We're going to do a coarse align th_s time. Okay?
005:14:03 Schirra (onboard): You are?
005:14:04 Eisele (onboard): Yes, sir, that's ...
005:14:05 Cunningham (onboard): You have the ORDEAL there.
005:14:06 Eisele (onboard): Yes.
005:14:07 Schirra (onboard): Yes.
005:14:08 Cunningham (onboard): Go ahead.
005:14:09 Eisele (onboard): Okay. Now, that's what you're going to read when we do it. It should be in plane, but it's going to be a different pitch angle. Are you ready? [Pause.]
005:14:16 Schirra (onboard): Yes, I had no idea we were ...
005:14:23 Eisele (onboard): [Garble] GDC is still good where it was.
005:14:26 Cunningham (onboard): Yes.
005:14:27 Schirra (onboard): [Garble]
005:14:28 Eisele (onboard): Keep that little devil going.
005:14:29 Schirra (onboard): Okay.
005:14:33 Eisele (onboard): It's going right toward the belly now. It's still 90 degrees.
005:14:47 Eisele (onboard): You bastard, you would! Look at it.
005:14:53 Schirra (onboard): Okay, let's see.
005:14:54 Eisele (onboard): Well, I'm going to have to go hunt.
005:14:56 Schirra (onboard): Are we recording, Walt?
005:15:00 Schirra (onboard): Okay, Schirra had 20 clicks of water, 20 clicks of water from the water gun at 5 hours and 10 minutes.
005:15:13 Eisele (onboard): You didn't!
005:15:17 Cunningham (onboard): Oh, crap! Now we can spend the next 263 hours cleaning all that stuff up.
005:15:48 Eisele (onboard): And we didn't even come close.
005:15:53 Schirra (onboard): What do you mean? Was it faking or what?
005:16:08 Eisele (onboard): Yes. It's getting worse.
005:16:23 Eisele (onboard): [Garble] Boy, we are really moving around, aren't we?
005:16:27 Schirra (onboard): Yes. 10 degrees a second in pitch.
005:16:30 Eisele (onboard): Is that all? Boy!
005:16:36 Cunningham (onboard): [Garble] far behind [garble] take that in a basket. We'll pick it up, drop it [garble].
005:16:53 Cunningham (onboard): Okay, Alpheratz. What the hell is the other one? Mirfak over there, there you are.
005:17:09 Eisele (onboard): Whoops, can't make that one.
005:17:11 Schirra (onboard): [Garble] stop your rate.
005:17:13 Eisele (onboard): Never mind, I see what happened. Okay.
005:17:18 Eisele (onboard): I better [garble].
005:17:49 Schirra (onboard): Let's take a night and let's not freak around with this off-nominal.
005:18:01 Schirra (onboard): The nominal is doing fine.
005:18:11 Eisele (onboard): A quarter of that?
005:18:26 Schirra (onboard): If you want to record those, go ahead.
005:18:30 Eisele (onboard): Ha! We missed that. That ain't bad considering how screwed up I was to start with. That thing wasn't anywhere near the right - well, of course, we did get a coarse align, that's why. That's why it wasn't in the sextant. Okay, here are your angles. Jesus! Look at that! Oh, that's right! That was the coarse align. Okay, are you ready?
005:18:54 Schirra (onboard): Yes.
005:18:55 Eisele (onboard): Well, good. We're going to torque about 2½ degrees in yaw now. You always get a big one the first time through on account of the thing, of the coarse align type thing. Okay, I'm going to do it again, alright?
005:19:14 Schirra (onboard): You going to do the whole thing again?
005:19:16 Eisele (onboard): Well, just the fine align part. It will only take a second - It will only take a second, Walt.
005:19:21 Cunningham (onboard): Just don't get enamored with each roll we're doing; We're behind, right?
005:19:25 Eisele (onboard): Wait a minute.
005:19:33 Schirra (onboard): We haven't done our P30 DELTA-V yet.
005:19:39 Eisele (onboard): Huh?
005:19:40 Eisele (onboard): Yes, we're not really ahead. We are [garble].
005:20:12 Eisele (onboard): We do?
005:20:15 Schirra (onboard): Use a [garble]. It made my whole day. Seriously, we should get ...
005:20:26 Cunningham (onboard): How about these heaters? They're getting up there.
005:20:32 Schirra (onboard): That's alright.
005:20:59 Eisele (onboard): (Laughter)
005:21:03 Cunningham (onboard): Be quiet, 00000.
005:21:10 Schirra (onboard): Look at those numbers. Record those.
005:21:13 Eisele (onboard): Okay. Alright, the first batch was probably more significant, but I think they are on there long enough to get on them. But they were only the coarse align numbers, so it doesn't matter. These are 00000, 00012, 00001, coming up. And getting back [garble].
005:21:34 Schirra (onboard): Okay, should I GDC align with it?
005:21:40 Eisele (onboard): Yes, Wally, you can align with that, that's a good alignment now. [Garble] settled. That's your 6-4 deorbit REFSMMAT 180, 180 zero roll, minus [garble] if we have to.
005:21:55 Eisele (onboard): Okay, Walt, what have you got next on your list there?
005:21:59 Cunningham (onboard): Glycol to RADIATOR, secondary to BYPASS.
005:22:03 Eisele (onboard): Okay, glycol secondary - glycol to RADIATOR, secondary to BYPASS, right?
005:22:26 Cunningham (onboard): Roger.
005:22:27 Eisele (onboard): You are now bypassed on that little item.
005:22:29 Cunningham (onboard): Good, may not have to move it again.
005:22:32 Eisele (onboard): Okay, back to your mixing valve problem. I was wondering about that. This thing seems to be - The primary GLYCOL EVAP INLET TEMP valve is sitting on MIN. It hasn't moved off of there and I don't know ...
005:22:48 Cunningham (onboard): I think that's called MIN heat. That's okay. That is where it belongs.
005:22:52 Eisele (onboard): That means MIN heat?
005:22:54 Cunningham (onboard): Yes.
005:22:55 Eisele (onboard): What's that mean?
005:22:56 Cunningham (onboard): It means it is mixing MIN, which is where you want it.
005:22:59 Eisele (onboard): Okay, that is where it is. [Pause.]
005:23:04 Eisele (onboard): Okeedokee. [Garble] secondary glycol. You know, we are going to use up a bunch of ECS fuel if we have to keep taking out these damn rates all the time.
005:23:19 Cunningham (onboard): I know.
005:23:20 Eisele (onboard): We're not going to have as much as we thought, maybe, for certain items. It hasn't really changed, however.
005:23:31 Eisele (onboard): Walt, did you say you had sticky fingers? Oh, you did get one? I was going to say you could get a Kleenex and I'll wet it for you. You can do that. I did that.
005:23:47 Eisele (onboard): Oh, sob, where did the tape go?
005:23:54 Eisele (onboard): Huh? We're going to need it? Okay, we'd better start looking for it. Had it taped to the wall, and it is not there anymore. It'll show up somewhere. The way everything goes up, I expect to find it on the ceiling somewhere. I don't see it up there. [Long pause.]
TANANARIVE (REV 4)
005:24:44 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
005:25:04 Eisele (onboard): Evaporator.
005:25:07 Eisele (onboard): You want to turn that to OFF? Okay?
005:25:43 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
005:25:46 Schirra: Loud and clear.
Very long comm break.
005:25:48 Schirra (onboard): The CMS DELTA-V test is GO. We have prepared the P52 IMU realignment.
005:26:01 Cunningham (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7.
005:26:22 Cunningham (onboard): Did we do P30 yet, external DELTA-V?
005:26:31 Eisele (onboard): I'm still maneuvering around here. Here I am. Okay. I'll get my belt down here. That ought to hold it. Okay. 59 and 43, very good. Minus 3924, 00000, 3953. Pretty good size burn.
005:27:29 Eisele (onboard): 497 is your counter.
005:27:31 Schirra (onboard): 497 is [garble].
005:27:46 Schirra (onboard): Yes. When did that occur? Okay.
005:27:59 Schirra (onboard): 490 what? [garble].
005:28:01 Eisele (onboard): 497. [Long pause.]
005:28:16 Schirra (onboard): Okay, got 497.
005:28:19 Eisele (onboard): Why is this thing taking so long to compute for us?
005:28:29 Eisele (onboard): There she goes. 15, 153, and 33.1. That's pretty close.
005:28:41 Schirra (onboard): With all the number exercise, right?
005:28:44 Eisele (onboard): Huh?
005:28:45 Schirra (onboard): With all the number exercise?
005:28:48 Eisele (onboard): Number exercise, what do you mean? [garble].
005:28:50 Eisele (onboard): Yes, this is what you targeted for if you did the burn.
005:29:00 Eisele (onboard): Yes. [Garble] did it again. That is just about an hour and a half from now, I guess.
005:29:25 Eisele (onboard): How soon are we supposed to do the retro check?
005:29:37 Eisele (onboard): Okay. It's the latest [garble].
005:29:49 Schirra (onboard): Yes, you want to cycle through for GO/NO-GO.
005:30:01 Eisele (onboard): Theoretically, we are ready for a [garble] look at those angles come up there.
005:30:11 Schirra (onboard): I see.
005:30:16 Eisele (onboard): 3-1/2 hours from now. We can go up through the [garble] region.
005:30:28 Eisele (onboard): Yes, that's all I'm going to do. No, oh, no.
005:30:43 Eisele (onboard): Listen, how far do you want to go with P40? To the gimbal checks?
005:30:51 Eisele (onboard): The gimbal checks? Don't we turn it OFF then?
005:30:58 Schirra (onboard): Yes.
005:30:59 Eisele (onboard): Okay, that verifies that P40 is GO for the burn. That's the way we will have to do it.
005:31:08 Cunningham (onboard): Now, [garble] if we really do have to do this, we've got to remember to reload the right numbers in P30 because they got those data out again.
005:31:16 Eisele: Okay, check the DAP [garble].
005:31:23 Cunningham (onboard): Guess they did.
005:31:24 Eisele (onboard): Yes.
005:31:33 Eisele (onboard): 3246. That's very good. I got - what'd I get here - I got 86 and 30, I got 81 and 33 [garble] up, right after lift-off.
005:31:57 Eisele (onboard): I know, I just wondered what these numbers are. I obviously didn't know what they mean.
005:32:04 Eisele (onboard): Well, why would they change after lift-off? We haven't burned that much fuel.
005:32:08 Eisele (onboard): Well, I'll go ahead and load them in, anyway. [Garble] 2, 4 [garble] yes [garble] 00024.
005:32:31 Eisele (onboard): That realignment worked out very nicely. I got, I got the damn stupid alarm just like you always do on this freaking pick-a-pair. I went ahead and looked in there and just happened to look out, and the first thing I saw was the square of Pegasus, so I grabbed Alpheratz right off the bat and got that one, and then I tried to get Mirfak but he was out of the field of view, so on the way after Mirfak, I found Navi, so I used it instead.
005:32:58 Unknown crewman (onboard): (Laughter).
005:33:02 Eisele (onboard): And it worked out. And the first time I went through, we got about a half a degree on the first two registers, and 2-1/2 on the third one.
005:33:13 Schirra (onboard): On the [garble].
005:33:15 Eisele (onboard): On the gyro torquing, but that was because we were just on a coarse align. We expected to be a couple of degrees off. But I was a bit surprised at 2-1/2. I thought that was kind of big. So, but the second line came up and it nearly was zero. One of them was 12 000 something [garble] I could verify it, and we got a 180, 180 zero on the DSKY for the preferred attitude for the burn in P40. Yes, P40. So I would say that we're in very good shape. I reloaded the DAP for G&C control and four-jet ullage, and MIN DEADBAND half degree rate if you need it.
005:34:20 Unknown crewman (onboard): Only way to be, isn't it?
005:34:22 Eisele (onboard): I was sweating that aliglment a little hit. I looked out there and I didn't see a Goddamned thing for about 30 seconds. You have to get dark adapted or you don't see any stars, and they finally came in. And then after, you know, a couple of minutes, they were loud and clear.
005:34:37 Cunningham (onboard): Yes, how about that?
005:34:38 Eisele (onboard): It almost lost my attitude, I might as well stay there.
005:34:43 Eisele (onboard): Are we recording?
005:34:46 Eisele (onboard): I hope. Since I've been saying all this, I hope it gets on the tape (laughter).
005:34:54 Eisele (onboard): The PIPA BIAS is all within limits, too. I wrote it down in the two log books. I don't remember exactly what they were.
005:35:02 Cunningham (onboard): Did you log it?
005:35:03 Eisele (onboard): I wrote it, I didn't say it. [garble]
005:35:12 Eisele (onboard): Huh?
005:35:13 Schirra (onboard): I'm almost in attitude, I'm going to go for it.
005:35:19 Schirra (onboard): [Garble] yaw particularly, lots of yaw.
005:35:29 Schirra (onboard): Hey, we're not using any fuel. We got more now than we had awhile ago (laughter). We are slightly [garble] (laughter).
005:35:41 Schirra (onboard): God bless, is that a sight there?
005:35:45 Cunningham (onboard): Okay, I'll go look for it.
005:35:49 Schirra (onboard): Okay, you haven't been down there yet, anyway. Have a ball.
005:35:55 Eisele (onboard): I think the only thing that is loose down there is the crazy urine hose. I didn't get a chance to ...
005:36:00 Schirra (onboard): Did you flush that hose?
005:36:01 Eisele (onboard): Huh?
005:36:03 Schirra (onboard): Did you flush it?
005:36:04 Eisele (onboard): Flush it?
005:36:05 Schirra (onboard): With air.
005:36:06 Eisele (onboard): No, I didn't. I never could get anything to go in it that I know of.
005:36:14 Eisele (onboard): Okay. Well, hold it.
005:36:20 Eisele (onboard): Are we pu_ging through the urine hose? [Garble] that elbow [garble] Well, what's on there? Something is on anyway. No? Okay, the dump is on and the ...
005:36:30 Unknown crewman (onboard): [Garble].
005:36:40 Eisele (onboard): Oh, wait. Yes, okay, I get you. That's one. Well, here, let me give you the dingdang to that. Use the elbow and everything will be alright. Hell, I put it hack in there for - [garble]. There you go [garble]. How do you purge this little - put it - oh_ put the elbow on the end of it. Yes. Why don't you go ahead and do that? I have 1.7 volts which is what it was awhile ago, a good long while ago. Yes.
005:38:01 Eisele (onboard): Okay. Have at it.
005:38:04 Eisele (onboard): Okay, she is going down. Down to 0.6. Still going. It stopped at 0.6.
CARNARVON (REV 4)
005:38:47 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause.]
005:38:51 Schirra: Roger, loud and clear.
005:38:53 Swigert: Roger, loud and clear. 7, when you went over the hill we found your secondary coolant loop was working satisfactory, and everything looked good on the primary loop, also. [Long pause.]
005:39:08 Schirra: Roger. We concur.
005:39:10 Swigert: Okay.
005:39:12 Cunningham: Roger, we've isolated our secondary radiator again. We should not have to flow it again it again for the rest of the flight. The egress began - ECS redundant component check was completed satisfactorily. I still feel like there's slightly anomalous behavior there on the mixing valve possible on the primary loop. The glycol evap outlet temperature was running at 58 when I turned off the evaporator. [Long pause.]
005:39:40 Swigert: Roger. Copy. Walt, John Aaron is shaking his head. [Pause.]
005:39:49 Cunningham: Roger. We did check the glycol EVAP TEMP end valve on the cooling panel, and it was a MIN heat, so there's not much more that can be done there. [Long pause.]
005:40:00 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause.]
005:40:20 Unknown crewman (onboard): Okay.
005:40:23 Cunningham (onboard): What's that?
005:40:27 Eisele (onboard): Oh, did it? How did you dump it before?
005:40:35 Eisele (onboard): Oh, I see. You got a parfial hookup.
005:40:39 Eisele (onboard): I never got even a decent partial, I don't think. I might have got a little out of it. I don't know.
005:40:43 Eisele (onboard): Huh? Is it really pulling it out? You can feel it gurgle.
005:40:57 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
005:40:59 Schirra: Go ahead.
005:41:01 Swigert: Walt, we just want to talk over on that primary loop. Was the primary loop running when you read the 58 degrees; was it in operation when you read an EVAP OUT of 58 degrees? [Long pause.]
005:41:14 Cunningham: When I first read it, it was not pumping, but then it still was at 58 till I turned the evaporator on. There wasn't a great deal of time there between when I turned the pumps back on on the primary loop and went to EVAP, so maybe it just didn't get a chance to settle down. [Long pause.]
005:41:33 Swigert: That might be. Okay. [Long pause.]
005:41:44 Swigert: Your primary loop is working okay now, Walt? [Pause.]
005:41:49 Cunningham: That's affirmative.
005:41:51 Schirra: It's working very fine since lift-off, I would - I estimate we've been boiling to some extent most of the time. [Pause.]
005:41:59 Swigert: Ok.
005:42:02 Cunningham: We've run through urine dump operations twice,and it seems to be dumping fine, so far. [Pause.]
005:42:09 Swigert: Okay. Real fine. [Pause.]
005:42:15 Eisele: Jack, this is Donn. I completed that alignment at the heginning of this pass. I used Navi and Alpheratz, and we had five balls on the star difference, and I went through to fine align just to be sure. On the coarse align' we had about half a degree and 2 and 1/2 degrees on the gyro torque and angle. [Long pause.]
005:42:40 Swigert: Okay. Copy, Donn. [Pause.]
005:42:46 Cunningham: Do you want to go ahead with the hydrogen purge check heater coming on at 05 50? [Pause.]
005:42:52 Swigert: Roger.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control Houston, 5 hours, 49 minutes into the flight. Spacecraft is nearing the Guam zone of acquisition, the Guam Station to contact Apollo 7 for the first time today. Before we reach Guam let's unload about two to three minutes of tape which we collected during a swing over - a swing which took the spacecraft several hundred miles northwest of Australia. This from Carnarvon.
GUAM (REV 4)
005:50:26 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Guam.
And now we're talking to Apollo 7 through Guam and here's how that's going.
005:50:29 Schirra: Roger. Read you loud and clear.
005:50:32 Swigert: You're five-by.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control Houston apparently there will be no further comm by Guam so we'll take the circuit down at this time.
005:56:20 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Guam. [Pause.]
005:56:24 Schirra: Roger.
005:56:25 Swigert: And, Wally, we're planning - because of - we had this COMM problem during launch; we would like to do a VHF Duplex B check over stateside pass, sometime after yout do the day retro test, and we'll talk you all through it. [Long pause.]
005:56:47 Schirra: Okay.
005:56:47 Swigert: We'll just do it one time only, and that's it.
005:56:50 Schirra: Roger.
Long comm break.
005:57:00 Cunningham (onboard): Put this update list here somehere, would you? I don't have a place for it right now.
005:57:06 Eisele (onboard): Yes.
005:57:17 Schirra (onboard): Use bottom line of window, what's he talking about?
005:57:26 Eisele (onboard): Well, the line is a certain thickness and somebody said just to ...
005:57:30 Schirra (onboard): Oh, I see.
005:57:34 Eisele (onboard): ... just one side or the other, it doesn't - use the bottom side - it doesn't make any difference.
005:57:36 Cunningham (onboard): Where's the tape?
005:57:37 Eisele (onboard): I don't know, Walt, I was looking for it a while ago [garble] plenty of floods on that one.
005:58:14 Eisele (onboard): Yes. I'll have to get some in a minute.
005:58:16 Eisele (onboard): Where's your garbage?
005:58:27 Schirra (onboard): What are you doing?
005:58:30 Eisele (onboard): Who, me?
005:58:31 Schirra (onboard): Yes.
005:58:32 Eisele (onboard): Looking for the tape. You knocked me off my seat before.
005:58:38 Cunningham (onboard): I did what?
005:58:40 Eisele (onboard): Knocked me off my seat.
005:58:42 Cunningham (onboard): How did I do that?
005:58:44 Eisele (onboard): You pushed my leg down, backed me up to the wall.
005:58:46 Cunningham (onboard): Oh, I did? Your feet react nicely, it's just [garble] floating there.
005:58:56 Eisele (onboard): Wally_ What? [garble].
005:59:42 Schirra (onboard): You guys are going to have to, about the next 10 minutes, settle down so I can get this ATTITUDE. It's a precise test, we're carying down to a degree.
005:59:57 Cunningham (onboard): Okay, you want to get my feet ready? No.
006:00:07 Cunningham (onboard): Did you ever find the tape?
006:00:10 Eisele (onboard): Well, it's a mystery to me. I don't know. The last I saw of it, it was stuck to the front wall here. The next time I looked for it, it was gone.
006:00:19 Cunningham (onboard): What's this LOW/HIGH? What's that for?
006:00:22 Eisele (onboard): I haven't any idea what this is for. Are we - well, let's see, we're venting, but that shouldn't [garble] accumulator [garble]?
006:01:36 Schirra (onboard): Walt, you going underneath there again? I'm dead serious, I've got to pass here! I don't know what you are up to, but I've got a pass here, a control pass.
006:01:45 Cunningham (onboard): Wally, I can't help it. I'm just -
006:01:49 Schirra (onboard): Well, I said it and I meant it.
006:01:51 Cunningham (onboard): Jesus!
006:01:54 Schirra (onboard): I ask you to -
006:01:55 Cunningham (onboard): Would you lock your seat down? That's what is doing it. Can I lock your feet down in the ...
006:01:58 Schirra (onboard): Yes, I've got about 5 minutes to get into a fixed attitude, and you're freaking around down there like you ...
006:02:04 Cunningham (onboard): I'm not freaking around down here! I just drifted into it. I couldn't help it. That's why I asked you ...
006:02:07 Schirra (onboard): Now I lost the damn attitude. Aggravating! And shit! It's your trouble I can't get anything done right.
006:02:17 Cunningham (onboard): I appreciate that. I'm ...
006:02:18 Schirra (onboard): Okay - knock it!
006:02:28 Schirra (onboard): [Garble] kicking you when you're doing your IMU.
006:02:56 Cunningham (onboard): What did you say? You've still got a light?
HAWAII (REV 4)
006:03:52 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
006:03:55 Schirra: Roger.
006:03:57 Swigert: Wally, we'd like to have you do a PO - PPO2 check whenever you get a chance, the reason for this being that the second one was a little shaky. [Long pause.]
006:04:10 Schirra: Do a what? Roger. It was the sa-me as the one before. We were using the elbow that bleeds the cabin down in order to vent the unit line, and we end up not purging the cabin there for a period of about one rev, and now I am reading about 170 mm. I got another little problem here. The O2 flow has gone high about, oh, 3 minutes ago; it's still pegged on high. [Long pause.]
006:04:46 Swigert: Roger. Copy. Copy PPO2 172.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, 6 hours, 5 minutes into the flight of Apollo 7. We are talking to Apollo 7 through Hawaii and here is how it's going.
006:07:23 Schirra: Roger. At 6 hours 7 minutes into the mission, I took the magazine M frames 53 and 54: a tropical storm. [Long pause.]
006:07:35 Swigert: Roger. We copy. [Long pause.]
006:08:30 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause.]
006:08:34 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7.
006:08:35 Swigert: Roger. Walt, we are concerned about that O2 flow high. Have you still got it? And if so are you starting it through the malfunction procedure? [Pause.]
006:08:45 Cunningham: That's affirmative. And I'm on page 52 - about 42 here, the cabin seems to be holding high - I mean holding fine; it's normal. I have switched to REDUNDANT, cycled the accumulator with no effect, and I have cycled several times each water accumulator ON and OFF. [Long pause.]
006:09:06 Swigert: Roger. We copy. [Long pause.]
006:09:43 Schirra: [Garble]
Comm break.
006:10:49 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Are you calling?.
006:10:50 Schirra: That's affirm. [Pause.]
006:10:59 Swigert: Houston, Apollo 7. Go ahead.
006:11:00 Swigert: Stand by. [Long pause.]
HUNTSVILLE through ANTIGUA (REV 4)
006:11:20 Unknown crewman: 34.70 degrees and that was 22 seconds late. That was 06 hours, 10 minutes, 22 seconds. [Pause.]
006:11:27 Swigert: Okay. Houston, Apollo 7, this is Houston. You're over the Huntsville now, Wally; do you read? The voice data is coming in very garbled. We'll pick you up loud and clear over California in just about a minute.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, we're - obviously we and the crew are looking at the O2 flow. It's in a high mode. And as Walt Cunningham said he can't explain it just yet. We expect to have new contact with the spacecraft via California momentarily. We'll come back to you when we get that. At 6 hours and 13 minutes into the flight this is Apollo Control, Houston.
006:14:23 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7. Over.
006:14:25 Swigert: Roger. ApoLlo 7, Houston. read you five-by. [Pause.]
006:14:29 Schirra: Roger. That's your trend data shown on cabin pressure? We show it holding. Do you show it increasing at all? [Pause.]
006:14:39 Swigert: Roger. Apollo 7. We show it holding also, not increasing. [Pause.]
006:14:43 Schirra: Thank you. [Long pause.]
006:15:33 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
006:15:35 Schirra: Go ahead, Houston.
006:15:37 Swigert: Roger. Your COMM was garbled over the Huntsville, Wally; and you were trying to read down today retro check. Didn't that fix go okay? [Pause.]
006:15:45 Schirra: Negative.
006:15:46 Swigert: Roger.
006:15:47 Schirra: Say, have them call in these times.
006:15:49 Swigert: Okay.
006:15:51 Schirra: And all, at 6 hours 10 minutes 22 seconds. Was the bottom of the lines on the canthrim, and was the COAS set at 31.7, also? Matched up perfectly, at 134.7 degrees in pitch. [Long pause.]
006:16:17 Swigert: Okay.
006:16:19 Schirra: I'd like to revalidate that time. [Pause.]
006:16:26 Swigert: Okay.
006:16:28 Unknown crewman: Like to revalidate that time. [Pause.]
006:16:32 Swigert: Okay. We got that data. [Long pause.]
006:17:12 Schirra: Roger. It is flush from 3 degrees, but we should do better. [Long pause.]
006:17:26 Swigert: Instead of 138. [Pause.]
006:17:32 Schirra: Say again. [Long pause.]
006:17:46 Swigert: I am sorry, Wally. That was my error. [Long pause.]
006:18:06 Schirra: Roger. What's with the end of eight? [Long pause.]
006:18:29 Swigert: Well, we read you up 138. We are just going through it now, trying to find out what the difference is. [Long pause.]
006:18:44 Schirra: 3.3 degrees.
Comm break.
HUNTSVILLE through ANTIGUA (REV 5)
006:20:12 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7, Any ideas on the 02 FLOW HI? We are still bleeding the cabin out. It doesn't seem like that could possibly account for that much , but that is the only leak we can account for. [Long pause.]
006:20:23 Swigert: Walt, we are still going through it.
006:20:25 Swigert: Hight now, we are kind of thinking it is a sensor failure. [Pause.]
006:20:35 Swigert: We will take a look at it a little bit further as we go along and let you know. [Pause.]
006:20:42 Cunningham: Roger.
Long comm break.
006:24:34 Eisele (onboard): Ooo, wow, wow, wow, look at that one line. Look at that DELTA there.
This is Apollo Control Houston. 6 hours 22 minutes into the flight. We still don't have a good explanation for the fact that we are using oxygen in the high-flow rate position in the cabin. Walt Cunningham - that sort of system falls in purvue of Walt Cunningham over in the right couch. He is working the problem, looking over his checklist and we are working it down here on the ground. There is some belief that it might be a sensor or a faulty sensor and I guess really that is the only possible thing I have heard rumored about. Again, we have no explanation for it at this time. We are watching it. We have some tape from the start of the pass as we move down and across the California - Baja California and down through Mexico. Here is that tape now.
006:24:43 Cunningham: Six hours and 24 minutes into the flight, I took frames 55 and 56 on magazine M looking at several islands in the Ocean. [Long pause.]
006:24:57 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
Comm break.
006:25:06 Cunningham (onboard): Yes, okay. Will you give me a NAV program, Donn? It's in the checklist log. We got a lot of shit spread out here. [Long pause.]
006:25:54 Eisele (onboard): Yes.
006:26:02 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
006:26:04 Schirra: Go ahead.
006:26:06 Swigert: Roger. On the O2 flow problem: we've looked it over pretty well. We can't see anything that would cause high O2 flow. Surge tanks holding well, cabin is not increasing, so we kind of had the feeling it's probably a sensor failure. [Long pause.]
And this is Apollo Control Houston. We are looking at the overall oxygen quantities here naturally, and looking at this oxygen flow, and we show something like 97 percent ... Here is Jack Swigert talking to the crew.
006:26:23 Swigert: And we have some corrections on that mannual retroattitude, the one you are going to do at 6 plus 50. [Pause.]
006:26:31 Schirra: Roger. Go ahead.
006:26:33 Swigert: Okay. It is pitch attitude. Pitch attitude should be 339, and yaw attitude should be 000.5.
Comm break.
006:26:50 Schirra (onboard): You are pretty sure of roll by now, huh?
006:27:00 Schirra (onboard): What do you calculate for that first one?
006:27:18 Cunningham (onboard): Donn, what are you up to?
006:27:19 Eisele (onboard): Me?
006:27:20 Schirra (onboard): Yes.
006:27:21 Eisele (onboard): Oh, I'm down here in the corner. Why? What you need?
006:27:23 Cunningham (onboard): You want to put this up?
006:27:26 Eisele (onboard): Yes. Where are the helmets? Where are the helmets? Oh, I see. You just put it in a temporary bag.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 6 hours, 27 minutes into the flight. The spacecraft just starting its 5th revolution around the Earth. It is now crossing the 80th [18th] parallel just north of the Panama Isthmus. And in case you missed that last transmission from Swigert, we have considered the oxygen high flow question that has come up since - oh - been looking at it for about the last 10 or 1S minutes since just before the spacecraft was acquired by Hawaii. And we have looked at total usage. We have looked at the cabin pressure and the fact that it is holding at a very steady 5 - 5 pounds to 5.1 pounds per square inch and we are looking at the total quantity and at least at this time we are satisfied that it is simply a sensor error. It is an invalid reading and of course we will continue to look at it, but over that period of time we could see something that would explain a leak or something else. And the data does not show that. The crew, I believe has - we have loss of signal and so that will conclude this message at 6 hours and 29 minutes into the flight.
006:28:03 Eisele (onboard): Hey, Walt, here is [garble] attitude [garble] if you want to leave it.
006:28:12 Cunningham (onboard): Yes, I do.
006:28:13 Eisele (onboard): Huh?
006:28:14 Eisele (onboard): No, I had it on the wall, I just thought I'd give it to you in case you wanted it. So what - you want to keep it down here? Yes, you'll need that.
006:28:23 Swigert: Houston, Apollo 7. We want to go ahead and purge, right now.
Very long comm break.
006:28:30 Eisele (onboard): I'm still trying to locate that stupid tape.
006:28:34 Cunningham (onboard): Really?
006:28:35 Eisele (onboard): I don't know where in the hell that got to.
006:28:40 Schirra (onboard): [Garble] I guess it ...
006:28:45 Eisele (onboard): Well, I had it on the wall, Wally, and it just got ...
006:28:48 Schirra (onboard): [Garble] Got knocked off?
006:28:49 Eisele (onboard): Well, I don't know. Apparently sticking things to the wall isn't all it's cracked up to be, because as soon as you bump - No, I thought that tape, you know, and as sticky as it was, and I had a pretty good chunk of it pasted on there. It got loose somehow and -
006:29:06 Schirra (onboard): Oh, oh, oh, oh (moan).
006:29:54 Eisele (onboard): Are you flying?
006:29:57 Schirra (onboard): Yes. I got a piece of shit [garble] right in it.
006:30:05 Eisele (onboard): Where are you going now? Do you need [garble].
006:30:11 Unknown crewman (onboard): [Garble]
006:30:18 Eisele (onboard): Not yet, Walt, I'm looking for tape yet.
006:30:22 Eisele (onboard): Oh, I am going to be grabbing hold of a couch now.
006:30:24 Schirra (onboard): Let's put the couch down.
006:30:28 Cunningham (onboard): Well, I was thinking, when we get close to your attitude - you kind of snuck it in - why, I'll have to be quiet. Or if you want, I'll be quiet right now, but ...
006:30:43 Schirra (onboard): No, I'm opening -
006:30:50 Cunningham (onboard): What I was doing before, apparently, was bumping into your seat pan ...
006:30:53 Schirra (onboard): Yes.
006:30:54 Cunningham (onboard): ... which-in turn was bending your legs around [garble] then move up. It's screwing you up. It's locked on there, it shouldn't be doing that.
006:31:05 Eisele (onboard): Walt, I'll see if I can get - get at it [garble] photography [garble].
006:31:46 Eisele (onboard): Okay, let's see if I can get you a 121 magazine here.
006:32:11 Eisele (onboard): Here is a 121.
006:32:24 Eisele (onboard): There's the tape. All the time [garble] and there it's hanging underneath your helmet ...
006:32:30 Schirra (onboard): Walt, I put it ...
006:32:33 Eisele (onboard): ... Just sitting there, staring at me (laughter).
006:32:39 Cunningham (onboard): Can you reach it, or do you want me to go get it? I'll have to put the seat down if I go.
006:32:46 Eisele (onboard): I think if you just roll over to your right side. Can you see it?
006:32:50 Cunningham (onboard): Uh-huh.
006:33:07 Schirra (onboard): Hey, did you get that tape, Walt? You got it now?
006:33:14 Cunningham (onboard): Yes. No, it's on this side. You'd better grab it.
006:33:20 Eisele (onboard): I'd like to. Where is it?
006:35:40 Schirra (onboard): No, it isn't. Just goes on a complete tour Of the spacecraft. Oh, you are going to use it.
006:36:10 Unknown crewman (onboard): (Sneeze).
006:36:28 Eisele (onboard): Okay. (Laughter) Stay away from Wally's couch. Man, if I let go of anything, I'll just float right over there into it. I don't know what the hell it is.
006:36:48 Schirra (onboard): Maybe you're just too lazy [garble].
006:37:19 Eisele (onboard): Say, Walt, what are you doing, just floating around?
006:37:51 Eisele (onboard): Yes. Last night. Yes [garble].
006:38:10 Schirra (onboard): You can really hear those thrusters, can't you?
006:39:11 Eisele (onboard): What's that? Oh, he asked you if you got your preselected food. Makes pretty good [garble] soup [garble].
006:42:58 Eisele (onboard): Yes, I've got it, Walt.
006:42:59 Schirra (onboard): You do?
006:43:07 Eisele (onboard): Yes, I'll watch it like a hawk from now on.
006:43:10 Schirra (onboard): Okay. [Garble] I do too. [Garble] I got here 23 - 33.58 [garble].
006:43:38 Eisele (onboard): You need the DSKY on that now, Wally?
006:43:45 Schirra (onboard): Yes, I guess so. The number won't be much longer.
006:43:47 Eisele (onboard): Okay.
006:43:49 Schirra (onboard): How soon do you need it?
006:43:51 Schirra (onboard): I don't particularly - I just haven't checked a computer problem which we're using in a few more seconds.
006:43:59 Eisele (onboard): Yes, alright.
006:44:02 Eisele (onboard): Move over that way a little.

006:46:58 Cunningham (onboard): Well, let's see.
006:47:55 Eisele (onboard): What? [Garble] No. [Garble] see [garble] through the window.
006:48:39 Schirra (onboard): There's no rea] [garble].

006:49:05 Schirra (onboard): RCS active hold [garble]?
006:49:25 Eisele (onboard): Really? Are we in deadband?
006:49:30 Schirra (onboard): No, I've got to get this stuff done, Donn.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, 6 hours, 49 minutes into the flight. We had a little, very small audible communication through Ascension a few minutes ago. Here is how that went.
006:50:01 Cunningham (onboard): [Garble] I asked for a window update. What am I doing?
006:50:06 Eisele (onboard): Well, nothing.
006:50:15 Cunningham (onboard): ... S-band ...
006:50:21 Unknown crewman (onboard): Yes.
And this is Apollo Control, Houston. At this point Flight Director Glynn Lunney is talking with his various flight directors and asking them to consider very well the performance in their areas of speciality up to this point. Within about 30 minutes when the spacecraft reaches the tracking ship, Mercury, which is parked off the China coast. At that point the Flight Plan calls for Lunney to give the crew a GO for 18 dash 1. And before he does that,in the act of consideration, he wants to carefully weigh all of the up rating situations up to this point which of course have been quite favorable. But at the same time they'll get a very careful screening before that GO is given. The Mercury station should - the Mercury ship is to acquire at 7 hours, 22 minutes into the flight. We are presently 6 hours and 5i minutes. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
006:50:35 Cunningham (onboard): Did you get the reading?
006:50:39 Cunningham (onboard): Yes, I think the computer is a little bit off. Somehow it had the wrong attitude in there.
006:51:55 Cunningham (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7.
006:52:06 Cunningham (onboard): You want the [garble] report, Walt?
006:52:20 Schirra (onboard): Okay, on the manual retro attitude check for night. Roll, 186329; yaw, 0; pitch out at 504 [garble]
And this Apollo control, Houston, 7 hours 03 minutes into the flight. Via Tananerive we've been talking to the crew and here is how that goes.
TANANARIVE (REV 5)
006:58:12 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. [Pause.]
006:58:20 Schirra: Houston, do you read? Apollo 7.
006:58:22 Swigert: I read you five-by. How me?
006:58:25 Schirra: Read you the same. Check we are right on Earth limb. The airglow is 2.8 degrees thick during that check. The COAS is a better - [Long pause.]

007:01:25 Swigert: Roger. I understand you're making a fuel cell purge.
007:01:28 Cunningham: Roger. Check it out. [Pause.]
007:01:33 Swigert: I didn't get it, Walt; say again.
007:01:36 Cunningham: I'm in the midst of a fuel cell purge. I've done one on hydrogen fuel cell 2, and fuel cell 3 to follow. [Pause.]
007:01:44 Swigert: Roger. Copy. I can give you some - an update on your orbital map here. [Pause.]
007:01:53 Cunningham: Roger. Standing by; go ahead.
007:01:55 Swigert: Okay. For REV 5, the node - the time of the node will be 07 plus 17 plus 38. Longitude of the node will be 106.5 degrees ernst. [Long pause.]
007:02:18 Cunningham: Roger. 106.5 east, 07 plus 17 plus 38. [Pause.]
007:02:25 Swigert: Roger. And the right ascension will be 06 plus 49. [Pause.]
007:02:32 Cunningham: Say again.
007:02:33 Swigert: The right ascension will be 06 plus 49. [Pause.]
007:02:39 Cunningham: 06 plus 49. [Pause.]
007:02:48 Swigert: Okay. And, 7 - Wally, you faded out on when you were describing the night retro check; we didn't get your comments on the COAS.
007:02:48 Schirra: Roger. I set the COAS for 31.7 degrees. It was more readily usable than the window align for that retro. [Long pause.]
007:03:09 Swigert: Okay. Roger. Okay. Real good. Mas the basic data correlated pretty well for the night retro, Wally? [Pause.]
007:03:15 Schirra: That's affirmative. It looked real good on the earth horizon. [Pause.]
007:03:19 Swigert: Okay. That's what they're shooting for. We'll talk to you over Guam about the day retro check and the discrepancy there. [Pause.]
007:03:25 Schirra: Roger. [Pause.]
007:03:31 Swigert: And, Apollo 7, we plan to do that Duplex V cheek just as we start Guam there. [Pause.]
007:03:37 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause.]
007:04:24 Swigert: Apollo 7. You are 1 minute LOS Tananarive;pick you up in Mercury in about 18 minutes. [Pause.]
007:04:30 Schirra: Roger.
Very long comm break.
MERCURY (REV 5)
007:22:30 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through the Mercury. How do you read? [Pause.]
007:22:34 Schirra: Roger. Read you loud and clear.
007:22:36 Swigert: Roger, Wally. You're five-by. How's the spacecraft systems status? [Pause.]
This is Apollo Control, Houston, 7 hours, 22 minutes into the flight. In a very few seconds the ship, Mercury, parked off the coast of China should acquire the spacecraft now. The acquisition is planned for right now. As a matter of fact, and when it comes we'll cut into it. There will be discussion with the crew over how or what their status is and discussion of the events over the next few hours. Here is that discussion now.
007:22:43 Schirra: We are in pretty good shape. We detected a continual yaw which we suspected before we started to fly. I'll give you some data on that. The control mode is SCS attitude HOLD, MAX deadband, high rate, limit cycle is ON. [Long pause.]
007:23:06 Schirra: At 7 hours 17 minutes and 3 seconds, yaw was plus 007.10. At 17 hours 18 minutes and 56 seconds, yaw was plus 007.82, and it cycles back and forth between those kind of numbers at that rate. [Long pause.]
007:23:33 Swigert: Okay. We copy.
007:23:35 Schirra: We are knocking on the plus yaw side of the deadband. [Pause.]
007:23:40 Swigert: Roger.
007:23:43 Eisele: The other systems are GO with the exceptiom of the - well, we seem to have the O2 full high come off the peg. [Pause.]
007:23:52 Swigert: How so?
007:23:55 Eisele: Must have been a stuck valve.
007:23:58 Swigert: Did you use the BARDOL procedure? [Pause.]
007:24:02 Eisele: We used BARDOL procedures, but that was like an hour ago. [Pause.]
007:24:06 Swigert: Roger.
007:24:08 Eisele: And water accumulator auto 1: the flowmeter looks sluggish, and it's reading about .75 - make mhat about .8. The light is out. [Long pause.]
007:24:23 Schirra: It is decreasing; it must be a winner.
007:24:26 Swigert: Roger. Do you have any other system problems? [Pause.]
007:24:32 Eisele: Donn solved his urine dump system problem. [Pause.]
007:24:38 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
007:24:40 Schirra: That sounds like a personal problem.
007:24:42 Eisele: Yes, it was. [Pause.]
007:24:47 Swigert: Does the spacecraft look good for about 18 revs? [Pause.]
007:24:51 Schirra: Eighteen revs a day.
007:24:53 Swigert: Okay.
007:24:54 Schirra: We're ready to move to fast time right nOW. [Pause.]
007:24:58 Swigert: How about going back to MSOB and starting over tomorrow? [Long pause.]
007:25:30 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. You are GO for 18 dash 1. [Pause.]
007:25:36 Schirra: That suits us.
007:25:37 Swigert: Real fine. Tom has got a question here for you. [Pause.]
007:25:41 Unknown crewman: Go ahead.
007:25:42 Swigert: Okay. Wally, just want to hack out real fast on that one retro cheek. The night retro check came out real good, and the retro wants - John wants to ask you one question here. On a daylight check, when you came up to the 6 hours and 10 mimfces, you read 134.7 at that time? [Long pause.]
007:26:02 Schirra: That is affirmative. We were 20 seconds late with the cheek because it was so far off, and I was trying to bring it in. [Pause.]
007:26:10 Swigert: Okay. Well, we do have some NAV vectors. They can account for a 1.4 difference, and it looks like what they would like to do is - down the road sometime is run another one. [Long pause.]
007:26:21 Schirra: Okay. Let us do a little more homework on it, and we'll use the fuel. [Pause.]
007:26:25 Swigert: Okay.
007:26:26 Schirra: Those are kind of expensive.
007:26:28 Swigert: Say again, Wally.
007:26:30 Schirra: Those are kind of expensive to use as fuel.
007:26:33 Swigert: Yes, we agree completely and said the night check came out good, and - well, they can account for half of that difference due to a vector. [Pause.]
007:26:41 Swigert: Apollo 7. Opposite omni. [Long pause.]
007:27:17 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston, We would like to shift over to Duplex B for a radio check. [Pause.]
007:27:26 Swigert: Okay. Opposite omni on S-band first. [Pause.]
This is Apollo Control in Houston, 7 hours 27 minutes into the flight and to repeat. Flight Director, Glenn Luney has given Apollo 7 a GO for 18-1, a GO for 18-1 and we will go back and try for any additional commentary coming to us by Guam.
007:27:33 Cunningham: Apollo 7 on Duplex B. How do you read? Over.
007:27:36 Swigert: Okay. Stand by until we can get reconfigured with the site here, Walt. [Pause.]
007:27:41 Cunningham: I'm already switched. How are you - oh, you're reading me S-band?
GUAM (REV 5)
007:27:44 Swigert: Okay. We're real good. We read you Duplex B real fine. [Pause.]
007:27:52 Cunningham: Roger. I'm reading you five-by-five. Do you read me Duplex B? [Pause.]
007:27:58 Swigert: Five-by. Stand by one. [Pause.]
007:28:06 Swigert: Okay. Apollo 7, you can go hack Simplex A. The voice check was real good. [Pause.]
007:28:16 Cunningham: Apollo 7. Simplex A. How do you read?
007:28:18 Swigert: You're five-by. [Pause.]
[Garbled] 18-1. That was a sign that the crew could proceed to remove their space suits. We have had no positive confirmation that they have started that step yet. But it was - it is an understanding and it is written into their Flight Plan and ours that the suits would start coming off at this point. This is Apollo Control in Houston.
007:28:22 Cunningham: Likewise here.
Comm break.
007:30:25 Unknown crewman: We got our O2 FLOW HI back.
007:30:28 Swigert: Roger. We see it. And you've got 1 minute LOS Guam; pick you up on Hawaii in about 8 minutes. [Pause.]
007:30:36 Unknown crewman: Roger. And we had a successful purge, both hydrogen and oxygen, all three fuel cells. Looking ahead, I see vent batteries at 8 hours. We did that as part of our postinsertion checklist. [Long pause.]
007:30:49 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
007:30:51 Unknown crewman: The systems test meter position 4A went down to .60. That's as low as it went on the vent. [Pause.]
007:30:58 Swigert: Roger.
Long comm break.
RILEY This is Apollo Control, 7 hours and 39 minutes into the mission. We're just about ready to acquire Apollo 7 at Hawaii Station. We'll stand by for that pass and Seven will go on down through the Huntsville's acquisition area. Here's the call now.
HAWAII through GUAYMAS (REV 5)
007:39:45 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
007:39:48 Schirra: Go ahead.
007:39:50 Swigert: Okay. Through Hawaii now. One thing GNC wanted to check on: they got a bit on TM that showed you had a restart- Have you had any RESTART lights on your computer? [Long pause.]
007:40:01 Schirra: This is 7. That was in a routine we've done. We did zero optics, and we found from zero optics - we thought everything was okay, which would be capable because of the low rate in the lighting. [Long pause.]
007:40:17 Swigert: Okay. You're kinda garbied. I understand you did have one to reset and looks like all the erssable is real fine. [Pause.]
007:40:25 Unknown crewman: [Garble].
Very long comm break.
Apollo Control, 7 hours and 45 minutes. We have LOS at Hawaii and we'll continue the monitor through to Huntsville.
007:51:25 Stafford: Hello, Apollo 7, Houstoun.
007:51:27 Schirra: Roger, Tom. Go. ahead.
007:51:29 Stafford: Okay. Got good COMM with you now, Wally. Just wanted to recheck on the computer. When you did - did you get the alarm light at the same time that the RESTART - program alarm at the same time that the RESTART came on? [Long pause.]
007:51:41 Schirra: That's affirmative. We've wrote that off as no problem, Tom.
007:51:44 Stafford: Okay. But you did get a RESTART and a program alarm about the same time? [Pause.]
007:51:48 Schirra: That's affirmative. Thet was due to the zero optics. The gage swung too fast. [Pause.]
007:51:54 Stafford: Okay. One item I want to - we're starting to track the S-IVB, and it's not separating as fast as they had anticipated. It's going to take a while to track it out, and then we'll have plenty of time on it. [Long pause.]
007:52:11 Schirra: Okay.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 7 hours, 54 minutes into the flight. Apparently we will have no more comm through Guaymas. The spacecraft will be proceeding down Eastern Pacific, running parallel to the Mexican - Central American area without any further contact. I want to emphasize in that last message the statement that the separation distance between the Command Module and the S-IVB is not running exactly according to the earlier prediction. You recall about an hour, an hour and a half ago, we told you that the two were about 15 miles apart; the Command Module in front and slightly below the S-IVB. And the prediction the Flight Dynamics Officer gave us then was that they would continue to separate at the rate of 4 or 5 miles per hour for a period of 7 or 8 hours, and perhaps reach a maximum separation point of about 100 miles before they would slowly come back together. Now that separation rate is not proceeding according to the reference prediction. We have no new numbers on just how it is proceeding, but they think we can get some together before the news conference which will follow this shift. This is Apollo Control, Houston at 7 hours, 56 minutes into flight.
008:02:33 Eisele (onboard): [Garbled] I wish to hell I could [garbled] the next SM RCS.
008:02:35 Eisele (onboard): Hey, listen, I want to tell you [garbled] 076 [garbled] you know [garbled] Wally [garbled].
008:02:43 Schirra (onboard): About all there is to do is power up [garbled] .
008:04:33 Eisele (onboard): This may go away [garbled].
008:05:42 Cunningham (onboard): Hey, it might not be that lock on [garbled].
008:09:09 Schirra (onboard): Well, I'll tell you what I ended up doing is laying the neck ring [garbled] folded, then purge, and then just holding the right wing [garbled] after purge in about 6 or 8 seconds.
008:09:54 Schirra (onboard): ... How's the cabin pressure?
008:10:02 Schirra (onboard): [Garbled] 25 squirts of water at 8 hours, 10 minutes [garbled].
Apollo Control, Houston; 8 hours, 10 minutes. The second shift of flight controllers is now active in the Mission Control Center, headed by Flight Director Gene Kranz. The CapCom on this shift is astronaut - well, Tom Stafford is still here, but astronaut Ron Evans has just come in too, and will fill out the rest of this shift. We are estimating the new conference now with Flight Director Gene - with Flight Director Glynn Lunney of the first shift for 6:30 pm Central Daylight Time. Apollo Control; 8 hours, 10 minutes.
008:12:42 Schirra (onboard): [Garbled] 12 minutes, 46 seconds - 8 hours [garbled] we got about six or eight things [garbled] minutes until [garbled].
008:14:40 Eisele (onboard): Wally.
008:14:53 Eisele (onboard): (Laughter)
008:21:42 Cunningham (onboard): Hey, Wal]y [garble] the simulator must be in roll.
008:26:12 Schirra (onboard): Walt, when you put the Flight Plan over there [garble].
008:29:47 Cunningham (onboard): Yes, Wally.
008:29:57 Schirra (onboard): What did you say, Walt? [garble] Okay, that was really what I was worried about, t was getting a flashlight out of there.
008:30:18 Eisele (onboard): Don Don Don Dee, Don Dee Dee.
008:30:34 Schirra (onboard): Is that you talking, Walt?
Apollo Control, Houston; 8 hours, 31 minutes. We're coming up on the Tananarive station now, but we do not intend to initiate any communication with the spacecraft at Tananarive. We will stand by in case the flight crew wants to talk, but the Control Center will initiate communication during the pass. We're over the Pretoria, South African station, but there's no voice capability at Pretoria. If there is any communication at Tananarive we will bring it to you. Apollo Control.
008:31:53 Eisele (onboard): Wally. [Pause.]
008:32:03 Schirra (onboard): Yes, I think I will too. I could use it.
008:32:28 Eisele (onboard): (Laughter)
008:32:45 Eisele (onboard): Hey, Wally, I think I see the piece of tape you attached to the wall up there.
TANANARIVE (REV 6)
008:33:22 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
008:33:28 Cunningham: Roger, Houston. Go ahead.
008:33:30 Stafford: Roger, we are just standing by here. One item of interest, the hydrogen and oxygen purity is lots higher than predicted. It looks like the next purge that will be required will be some time after 40 hours. [Long pause.]
008:33:43 Eisele (onboard): Boy!
008:33:44 Cunningham: Roger, we'll stand by for your update, and since confession is good for the soul, one of those hydrogen purges ran a little better than 3 minutes last time. [Pause.]
008:33:54 Stafford: No problem. [Long pause.]
008:34:24 Cunningham (onboard): I'll just put it right here for the time being and [garble].
008:34:46 Cunningham (onboard): [Garble] Okay.
008:35:13 Cunningham: This is the LMP. I want to log 20 squirts on the water gun at 8 minutes - 8 hours and 35 minutes into the flight. [Long pause.]
008:35:31 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston. Roger, we copy. [Pause.]
008:35:36 Eisele (onboard): [Garble.] [Laughter.]
008:35:38 Eisele: We are using you for real-time logging whenever we have our DSM out of commission temporarily.
008:35:43 Schirra (onboard): ... This is really pretty nifty when you get out of these crazy suits.
008:35:46 Stafford: Okay.
Comm break.
008:36:49 Eisele (onboard): No, I didn't, because at the time you weren't hooked up.
008:36:53 Schirra (onboard): [Garble] yes [garble].
008:37:08 Schirra (onboard): Did you do it?
008:37:13 Cunningham (onboard): I'll tell you what, I'm just trying to hold you a place to the wall [garble].
008:37:57 Schirra (onboard): [Garble] you got velocity?
008:37:58 Cunningham (onboard): Yes.
008:38:00 Schirra (onboard): Okay, let's get those [garble].
008:38:36 Cunningham (onboard): Yes, I guess so.
008:38:49 Cunningham: Houston, this is Apollo 7. Do you have the good team on yet? [Pause.]
008:38:55 Stafford: Apollo 7. Say again.
008:38:58 Cunningham: Sounds like you've got the good team working there.
008:39:00 Eisele (onboard): [Garble].
008:39:02 Stafford: Yes. That's affirmed.
008:39:03 Eisele (onboard): What?
008:39:08 Cunningham: Hope you had nice trip back to Houston. [Pause.]
008:39:13 Stafford: We had a beautiful trip. I tried to contact you, but no go. [Pause.]
008:39:21 Cunningham: Understand; [Long pause.]
008:39:40 Schirra (onboard): (Laughter)
008:39:45 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston. We have 1 minute to LOS Tananarive.
Very long comm break.
008:39:53 Cunningham: Roger.
008:39:54 Eisele (onboard): Roger.
008:40:04 Eisele (onboard): Put this in your pocket if you want it. You don't want it? Okay.
008:40:33 Cunningham (onboard): Yes, Wally.
008:40:34 Eisele (onboard): Hey, Walt.
008:40:40 Cunningham (onboard): What's that?
008:40:48 Schirra (onboard): [Garble] over there.
008:40:53 Eisele (onboard): I'll get those things out, Wally.
008:40:57 Eisele (onboard): Huh?
008:41:02 Eisele (onboard): Yes, I will.
008:41:25 Eisele (onboard): Really?
008:41:28 Eisele (onboard): It isn't here. That's odd.
008:41:35 Eisele (onboard): What did you do with that, Wally?
008:42:10 Schirra (onboard): I've got the other two on, Walt, so they're -
008:42:49 Cunningham (onboard): You're what?
008:43:04 Eisele (onboard): Are you sure you didn't bring somebody along?
008:43:06 Schirra (onboard): What?
008:43:10 Eisele (onboard): Are you sure you didn't bring somebody along? (Laughter)
008:43:20 Schirra (onboard): (Laughter) It must be still in there.
008:43:36 Communication Technician: Voice control, Tananarive.
008:43:46 Eisele (onboard): Huh?
008:44:00 Eisele (onboard): [Garble] I'm beginning to like that. I've put it on about four times (laughter).
008:44:16 Eisele (onboard): Well, hell. We've got most of it in anyway.
008:44:53 Schirra (onboard): Boy [garble] better get the top of it [garble].
008:45:10 Cunningham (onboard): Do you want to?
008:45:14 Schirra (onboard): [Garble] you're welcome to it.
008:45:39 Cunningham (onboard): [Garble] (laughter).
008:45:40 Eisele (onboard): You have already got the other side.
008:45:45 Eisele (onboard): No, I don't think you can put any in it.
008:45:51 Schirra (onboard): No.
008:46:00 Eisele (onboard): I just put mine around back [garble].
008:46:24 Schirra (onboard): Hey, it's got little daisies on it. Isn't that cute?
008:46:32 Eisele (onboard): No trouble [garble] you made it this way.
008:46:33 Eisele (onboard): You may need your imagination a little bit.
008:47:02 Eisele (onboard): Say, I wonder how this stuff is going to feel [garble]. That's what I was wondering, whether I ought to get the Beta [garble] without putting on this a [garble] jacket off that Teflon [garble].
008:48:32 Eisele (onboard): Alright?
MERCURY (REV 6)
008:55:51 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. How do you read?
Long comm break.
008:59:31 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. [Pause.]
008:59:38 Cunningham: Roger, Houston. Go ahead.
008:59:39 Stafford: Roger. You're coming in loud and clear. Just wanted to check - have you got all the basic stowage squared away, Walt? [Pause.]
008:59:47 Cunningham: Seams like we have. We're up to that stage in the Flight Plan here where we kind of collect our housekeeping wits. Donn is attempting to settle down for a long winter's night. [Long pause.]
008:59:59 Stafford: Okay. Thank you. [Long pause.]
009:00:34 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Long pause.]
009:00:46 Cunningham: Roger. I switched, but I showed a better lock-up on omni A which I had before. It's back up now. I still have the O2 FLOW HI light. We've occasionally had the flowmeter come on down to around .8, but it's a very sluggish movement. I would appreciate it if, as soon as you get any kind of trend data on the option quantity, you'll let us know, and it'll really confirm the transducer problem.
Comm break.
009:02:22 Cunningham: Houston, this is 7. Over. [Pause.]
009:02:26 Stafford: Houston. Go. [Pause.]
009:02:30 Unknown crewman: We have block data on board up through REV 8, and we'll be standing for further update on block data at your convenience. [Pause.]
009:02:38 Stafford: Houston. Roger. [Pause.]
009:02:45 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston. Let's try opposite omni again. [Long pause.]
009:02:58 Cunningham: This one looks a little better to me, but not too good. I'm going to try in between if you'd like. I can kind of tell here on the single straight meter. That's negative. Omni A seems to be best from here. [Long pause.]
009:03:26 Stafford: Roger. Thirty seconds to LOS and okay for Omni A.
Very long comm break.
HAWAII (REV 6)
009:16:19 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston at Hawaii. Over. [Pause.]
009:16:23 Schirra: Roger. Reading you five-by.
009:16:26 Stafford: Roger. Good news tonight. There's no EKG on a CMP or the LMP. [Pause.]
009:16:34 Cunningham: Thank you very much (laughter). I'll tell the CDR. [Pause.]
009:16:39 Stafford: Since the CMP is asleep, don't bother him; but we've got some checks we want the LMP to do. [Pause.]
009:16:46 Cunningham: TPis is the LMP. Go on the checks. [Pause.]
009:16:50 Stafford: Roger. Check that the sensor that goes into the lower end of your breast bone - there right in your chest - is plugged in the line. Check that the sensor - the external sensor - is plugged into the box and is tight. And then when you're done with all that, if it doesn't make up, check that the sensor is strapped to the body. And - [Long pause.]
009:17:22 Cunningham: I found one sensor that was loose, It was the upper one - the upper sternum. [Pause.]
009:17:27 Stafford: Roger. [Pause.]
009:17:35 Cunningham: How are you reading me now?
009:17:38 Stafford: Loud and clear.
009:17:40 Cunningham: How's my EKG, I mean? [Pause.]
009:17:45 Stafford: Nothing yet. [Pause.]
009:17:49 Communication Technician: That's it. [Pause.]
009:17:54 Stafford: That fixed it, LMP.
009:17:57 Cunningham: Sorry about that. [Pause.]
009:18:04 Stafford: Opposite omni, please. [Long pause.]
009:18:33 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston. I have a block data on number 2 to give you.
Comm break.
009:20:17 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston.
009:20:20 Cunningham: Go.
009:20:22 Stafford: Roger. Both the last two stations confirm that you have been transmitting on both Simplex A and B. Do you concur? [Long pause.]
009:20:35 Schirra: That's affirm. We're now on Simplex A.
009:20:38 Stafford: Roger. We're about 1 minute to LOS. I'll have your block data for you over Tananarive if the voice is good; otherwise, on around. [Long pause.]
009:20:55 Schirra: Roger. We'll be standing by.

9 hours and 31 minutes into the mission. Apollo 7 is on it's sixth revolution down over the Eastern Pacific. We did have a brief bit of communication earlier in this revolution at Tananarive, and at the tracking ship Mercury Walt Cunningham reported that the Command Module Pilot, Dorm Eisele was settling down for his sleep period. And then over the Hawaii station which we just passed, the Flight Surgeons were successful in passing up some corrective measures for Cunningham to take to fix his EKG instrumentation. We'll bring you the tapes from those passes now.
Apollo Control, Houston; 9 hours, 42 minutes. That's the end of the tape, the CapCom you heard talking to flight crew through Hawaii was Astronaut John Young who's a member of the backup crew who has joined the astronaut Ron Evans at the CapCom console here in the Mission Control Center. Apollo 7's next station contact will be Tananarive at 10 hours, 7 minutes, 30 seconds Elapsed Time. Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 10 hours and 7 minutes Elapsed Time. We coming in to acquisition at Tananarive now. We'll stand by live through this pass.

010:09:11 Evans: Roger. You sound pretty good this time. [Pause.]
010:09:15 Schirra: Roger. We're changing our [garble] canister at this time. [Pause.]
010:09:19 Evans: Roger. [Pause.]
010:09:24 Cunningham: Houston, this is Apollo 7 again. Well, about 25 minutes ago, I guess, we noticed our glycol evap outlet temperature was climbing above 50, and the steam pressure was pegged low. The best [garble] above 60; we went to MANUAL and increased for 45 seconds, and we started to activate the secondary loop. Before we got the secondary loop completely activated, in about 10 minutes, the temperature started down again, and there was no noticed activity for a couple of minutes; but it looks like the water boiler valve just might have frozen, and now it seems to be controlling fine back in AUTO. [Long pause.]
010:10:18 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. We copy. [Pause.]
010:10:23 Cunningham: Roger. And I am in the midst of changing the lithium hydroxide canister. Would you verify it for me from the ECS people how long this button should have to be depressed preventing the canister prior to opening? It seems to be on a continual [garble]. [Long pause.]
010:10:40 Evans: Roger. Stand by. [Long pause.]
010:11:05 Evans: You don't even need to press a button there, Walt. [Long pause.]
010:11:31 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. That's just a momentary depress on that canister. [Pause.]
010:11:39 Cunningham: Roger. That's what I understood, but I think it must he for [garble] operation; it works all right now. [Long pause.]
010:12:21 Evans: Walt, we would like to verify that you reset your up-telemstry command switch and then it went back to normal. [Long pause.]

010:14:09 Cunningham: Houston, this is Apollo 7. We took and changed the canister out of the A side board on the ground that we had inadvertantly placed canister 2 in there. I switched canister 2 down to site B and removed canister 1, and canister 2 is now where it belonged in the first place. [Long pause.]
010:14:49 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. That's Roger. [Long pause.]
010:15:03 Schirra: Houston, the cabin reads 190.

This is Apollo Control. We have had loss of signal at Tananarive now. As you heard, this is the first change of lythium hydroxide canister. There are two canisters in the system that they are using to remove the carbon dioxide from the recirculated oxygen. One canister is changed every 12 hours. This was the first change right on schedule according to the Flight Plan. The next station to acquire will be the tracking ship MERCURY down off the coast of Japan, down between Japan and the Phillipines. Acquisition time there at 10 hours 30 minutes 40 seconds. This is Apollo Control at 10 hours 16 minutes."

This is Mission Control we have had LOS at the Mercury now. You heard Wally Schirra report the partial pressure of oxygen in the cabin as now 190 milimeters of mercury and that is the magic number they have been looking for. That is the sea level equivalent. When they reached that number, they closed the waste management vent valve which is the valve which has been venting the atmosphere introduced to the cabin on the pad; the 60/40 oxygen/nitrogen combination. So that valve is closed now. They are not venting and they do have a sea level in the cabin as far as partial pressure of oxygen. At 10 hours, we'll acquire again in Hawaii in about 8 minutes specifically 10 hours, 48 minutes and this is Mission Control at 10 hours, 39 minutes.
This is Apollo Control; 10 hours, 48 minutes into the mission. Apollo 7 coming up on aquisition of Hawaii tracking station now. We'll stand by through this pass.

010:49:59 Schirra: Nouston, Apollo 7. How do you read Duplex.A? [Pause.]
010:50:05 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. It's a little more garbled than the other, but still about four-by-five. [Pause.]
010:50:12 Schirra: Roger. You sound exactly the same.
010:50:15 Evans: Roger. Let me cheek to make sure we're receiving downlink and that we can proceed with our Verb 74. [Pause.]
010:50:22 Schirra: Roger. Do you want me to remain duplex A?
010:50:25 Evans: That's affirmative. We will stay Duplex A until get close to LOS, and if we happen to miss it, return to Simplex A at LOS. [Pause.]
010:50:35 Schirra: Wilco. And, for the dump I will do a [garble] ENABLE right? [Pause.]
010:50:42 Evans: That's a negative. You want to make sure the DSKY is clear, and it looks like it is. [Garble] Enter Verb 74 and enter, and then we will wait 1 minute. [Long pause.]
010:50:56 Schirra: Stending by on your MARK. [Long pause.]

This is Mission Control, 10 hours, 56 minutes. We've had LOS since Hawaii. The next station acquires tracking ship Redstone, be a very low elevation pass there. We think we will be able to have voice communications. But the elevation is just slightly over 3 degrees and it'll be a short pass. This operation with the computer during the Hawaii pas was to check the memory after the restart that the computer saw several hours ago. Flight controllers here wanted to double check to make sure that the memory had not been effected, and it appears to be very good at this time. At 10 hours, 57 minutes this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control; 11 hours, 5 minutes. We're coming up on the Redstone now. We'll stand by through that pass.

011:10:04 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Affirmative. Read you. [Pause.]
011:10:11 Cunningham: Roger. I'm reading you very weak. It seems we've been running into a lot of passes here where between passes we're left without a tape recorder running, and we don't quite know the status of it when we're left that way. We would like to be using it to record some of these problems. I assume you're observing the anomaly we've got in our steam pressure now. I'm going to reservice the water boiler. [Long pause.]
011:10:34 Evans: Roger. I understand. You're servicing the water boiler. [Pause.]
011:10:39 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7. Let's get those guys in the backroom to keep track of the tape recorder for us, please.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 11 hours, 10 minutes. We've had LOS with the Redstone. We're along way from the next aquistion we're in the revolutions that go down over the southern hemisphere and the next station to aquire will be the tracking ship Mercury at 12 hours 5 minutes 58 seconds. This is Apollo Control at 11 hours, 11 minutes, 20 seconds.
011:12:28 Schirra (onboard): Okay, at 11 - at 11 hours and 10 minutes into the flight, CDR logged 25 clicks on the water gun.
011:24:53 Cunningham (onboard): At about 11:15 LMP took [garble] clicks on the water gun.
011:30:10 Cunningham: And we've chlorinated the potable water at 11 hours 30 minutes into the flight. The potable water quantity is reading about 87 percent.
This is Apollo Control; 11 hours, 43 minutes into the mission. At the last pass of Apollo 7 over a tracking station in this case the Redstone, a tracking ship, Walt Cunningham mentioned a steam pressure anomaly. Flight Director Gene Kranz and some of his flight controllers have been working this problem. They think that we're seeing a freeze up of the water boiler on the primary coolant loop of the spacecraft. The spacecraft is powered down considerably and on the night side of the pass the water boiler does not have to work. But as we come into daylight and heat up, water then does flow to the boilers so that it can get rid of heat by evaporating water, that's what the water boiler does, and then when we go back into the night side in a low power configuration, it's the belief we may be getting a freeze up. There's water still in the boiler and may be freezing up. We're going to get a data dump at the next pass over the Redstone. We have a pass over the Mercury coming up at 12 hours 5 minutes elapsed time, but the Mercury has a problem with their unified S-band antenna which won't allow us to get a data dump there so we'll wait until the Redstone, get a data dump which will give us a better understanding of this problem. At the present time, it appears though to be a freeze up of the water boiler as it goes into the night side. At 11 hours 45 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
011:59:38 Cunningham (onboard): [Garble] 11 hours and 58 minutes into the flight, and frame 4 [garble].
This is Apollo Control at 12 hours, 5 minutes into the mission. Apollo 7 is coming up in to range of the tracking ship Mercury on its eighth revolution. We'll monitor communications through this pass.
MERCURY (REV 8)
012:06:14 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. AOS via Mercury. [Pause.]
012:06:18 Schirra: Roger. [Pause.]
012:06:27 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7. We temporarily had our primary loop back working on the line. It is beginning to look like the primary water flow valve. For a while, we thought it was stuck shut. However, I was able to, by playing with it, eventually get it to come back up with steam pressure reading normal for awhile. It's holding around a temperature of about 43. Right now, it's pegged low again. It looks like it's possibly the water control section of the 240 controller. [Long pause.]
012:07:05 Evans: Walt, say again there the last sentence there. It looks like what? [Pause.]
012:07:09 Cunningham: I believe it's probably getting down to the water control section of the 240 controller. Also, we had a DTO to accomplish here, the CRYO stratification for hydrogen. It's - both tanks are over 90, plus or minus 5, percent on the hydrogen, and the procedure calls to let the pressure rise to about 260 to 265, and I believe that's the spec number, and I'd like EECOM to tell me how high these pressures have been rising before they - the heaters shut off so I'll know where to start doing the DTO. Over. [Long pause.]
012:07:46 Evans: Roger. Stand by, we'll get it for you.
012:07:48 Cunningham: More specifically, Ron, I need the DEADBAND that the hydrogen pressure tank 1 and tank 2 have been running back and forth between. [Long pause.]
012:08:02 Evans: Roger. [Long pause.]
012:08:35 Cunningham: Tell Wally we just took a couple more pictures of his mountains to update them, [Pause.]
012:08:43 Evans: Roger. [Long pause.]
012:08:56 Cunningham: And we have been throwing data on that tape, and I hope we can get something workedout on that - the tape dumps - because we're terribly handicapped if we don't have the tape available to log on. [Long pause.]
012:09:17 Evans: Roger. Me concur, and I think we're back in cycle now on the thing. [Pause.]
012:09:23 Cunningham: Okay. Understand. It would be nice if you know that we are going to be going over the horizon without the tape in a RECORD mode for us. Let us know. [Pause.]
012:09:33 Evans: Roger. What it amounts to on these night passes or nighttime here, is that we're down to just about one site per rev to dump it, and the Mercury S-band is down right now. [Long pause.]
012:09:45 Cunningham: Roger. [Pause.]
012:09:51 Schirra: We only have two stars available for the 252 alignment. [Pause.]
012:09:58 Evans: Roger. We will have it shortly. [Long pause.]
012:10:25 Schirra: Air frame 6 and msgazine Bravo. Correction, magazine Peter. [Garble] [Long pause.]
012:10:39 Evans: I missed that, Wally. Say again.
012:10:41 Schirra: Roger. [Garble] I would estimate that he is a coonie. [Pause.]
012:10:47 Evans: Ah so. [Long pause.]
012:11:43 Schirra: Ron, do you have someone working with two stars? [Pause.]
012:11:51 Evans: Wait one - I think - P52. Don't we just pick a pair out of the CMC? [Pause.]
012:12:01 Schirra: Roger. We will go ahead like that.
012:12:03 Evans: Roger. [Pause.]
012:12:07 Schirra: Anybody come up with any suggestions on our ECS problem? The malfunction procedures call for activating the secondary loop whenever the primary radiator outlet temperature gets above 48. I have been resisting doing that and kind of going by the glycol EVAP TEMP. Right now, I am reading almost - radiator outlet temperature now that my glycol evap outlet TEMP is on about 52. [Long pause.]
012:12:37 Schirra: I would like to hold to not activating the secondary loop until the pimary, glycol evaporator outlet TEMP would hit 60. [Pause.]
012:12:43 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. We concur on that. We kind of believe that we're really - not really hot enough, and then we're starting to cool down when it starts evaporating - maybe overshootingn going too cold on that thing. We're working on that right now. [Long pause.]
012:13:04 Schirra: Okay. During the night pass, the glycol evaporator outlet temperature got down as low as about 45 - something like that - before we got the evaporator working again. [Long pause.]
012:13:16 Evans: Roger. [Pause.]
012:13:25 Schirra: Do we have anybody who can sending us extreme data on what the hydrogen pressure should cycle between?. [Pause.]
012:13:32 Evans: 7, Houston. LOS.

012:27:03 Cunningham: Roger. 228 to 246 and 237 to 255, and I see that's what the pressures have been cycling back and forth in the neighborhood of these readings? [Pause.]
012:27:11 Evans: That's affirmative in the R/O autoheaters and you can tell Wally that it looks like stars 11 and 12 would probably be pretty good stars to try for. [Long pause.]

013:06:23 Evans: Roger. And, Walt, we would like to verify that the primary evaporator water control valve on panel 382 is in the AUTO position. [Long pause.]
013:06:36 Cunningham: Roger. Did you read the data on the P52 that I did for the REFSMMAT realignment? [Long pause.]
013:06:48 Evans: I missed that. Say again.
013:06:51 Cunningham: Roger. [Garble] downlink when I did the P52 for the REFSMMAT realignment? [Pause.]
013:06:55 Evans: Affirmative. Three balls 1 and stars 1 and 7; and, secondly, we would like to know what portion of the malfunction procedures that you have acccmplished on the primary glycol of that ALT TEMP HI? [Long pause.]
013:07:15 Cunningham: Roger. I've gone down to box 18 or box 21, depending on how long you wait or whether you take the intermediate characteristics or not. That thing has stayed down for a long period of time; then it came up fairly spontaneosly to steam pressure. [Long pause.]
013:07:39 Evans: Roger. We understand. [Pause.]
013:07:43 Cunningham: And one time ended up over with the primary evaporator water control valve ... closed. The other possibility is the evaporator was frozen. I'm going to go check the water control valve now. [Long pause.]
013:08:00 Evans: Roger. Can you do that without disturbing our sleeping CMP? [Pause.]
013:08:09 Unknown crewman: We will be doing it. I also would like to get the same pressures that the height - that the oxygen tank is controlling to the actual pressures. [Pause.]
013:08:16 Evans: Roger. I have them if you're ready to copy. [Long pause.]
013:08:41 Unknown crewman: Ready to copy. Go. [Pause.]
013:08:46 Evans: O2 tank 1 deadband 880 to 926, O2 tank 2 870 to 912. [Pause.]
013:08:52 Unknown crewman: Roger. Thank you. And how about just correlating between what these meters are reading, if you want to run that 5.8 CRYO zero-g test. [Pause.]
013:08:59 Evans: Roger.
013:09:01 Unknown crewman: And the hydrogen test is in work now. [Pause.]
013:09:07 Evans: Roger.

013:11:17 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute to LOS. Simplex A on LOS. [Pause.]
013:11:24 Schirra: Roger.
013:11:25 Cunningham: And that was a good try on the evaporator water control. The evaporator water control primary is in AUTO; and for your information, I'm also runnnng with the evaporator water control secondary in AUTO in case I do get into a situation where I have to activate the secondary loop. [Long pause.]
013:11:45 Evans: Roger. Understand. [Long pause.]
013:12:00 Cunningham: Hey, Ron. It's not a good situation, but I don't consider we got any kind of real problems with that primary coolant loop right now. [Long pause.]
013:12:13 Evans: 7, Houston. We concur with that. [Pause.]
013:12:21 Evans: 7, Houston. We're just now looking at the dump data that we have picked up on REV 7. [Pause.]

This is Mission Control. Ascension has had LOS. We'll be out of touch with Apollo 7 now until it comes within range of the Mercury tracking ship over in the Western Pacific. Over this pass over Ascension, we got a little bit more information for the environmental control officer here towork (garble) the evaporator or the water boiler problem. As you heard Walt Cunningham does not consider it a major problem at this time and the Control Center here concurs with that. They are continuing to work on the problem and are evaluating the telemtry information received in the dump over the Redstone during the last pass. We'll acquire at the Mercury at 13 hours 40 minutes 43 seconds. At 13 hours, 13 minutes; this Mission Control.
013:24:20 Cunningham (onboard): At 13 hours 24 minutes and 30 seconds into this flight, we took on magazine Peter, frame - frames 7 and 8, what we believe to be the Red Sea.
013:27:26 Schirra (onboard): At 13:27:32, magazine P for Peter, frame 14 or 15: the Gulf of Omen.
013:31:38 Cunningham (onboard): At 13 hours and 32 minutes, I'm finishing up the first step of P5.8 CRYO zero-g test for hydrogen. Pressurizing the - the pressure seemed to be stabilized some 2 minutes after the time of [garble] fuel cells [garble].
013:32:12 Cunningham (onboard): My data shows that there's possibly a slight drop in pressure when I switch the fans ON. However, after looking at the needle, I can't really be sure. The range of pressures covered is very narrow, and we plan to operate by a set of ground figures. The pressure band will be my own estimation [garble] there is no [garble].
013:35:37 Cunningham (onboard): This is the [garble].
013:37:21 Cunningham (onboard): At 13:37 into the flight, frame 58 on magazine M was taken of the sidehatch window, documenting the continuing degradation of the outer frame of that window.

MERCURY (REV 9)
013:41:01 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. [Pause.]
013:41:05 Schirra: Got you loud and clear. [Pause.]
013:41:10 Evans: Roger. We would like to get a Verb 06 Noun 21; read out the PIPA count. We would like to get your onboard readout. Our Y PIPA count down here has - oh, it's been zero for a long time. [Long pause.]
013:41:35 Communication Technician: [Garble] through us. [Pause.]
013:41:44 Schirra: Roger, we can't very well fix that [garble] about 2 minutes.
013:41:44 Cunningham: Hey, Ron. I concluded CRYO T 5.8 for the hydrogen tanks at 90 percent level, and it didn't look to me like we had any stratification. My pressures that were loaded down did drop a little bit, but I'm not sure just from the angle I'm reading it. [Long pause.]
013:42:12 Evans: Walt, you are coming through HF this time across there, and I can't read you very well. Can you talk a little slower? [Pause.]
013:42:19 Cunningham: Roger. Understand. I did complete the hydrogen tanks, a 90-percent portion of the CRYO stratification test; and as I compared others, it was my own estimation that we really didn't have any stratification there.

GUAM (REV 9)
013:52:38 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston.
013:52:41 Schirra: Go ahead.
013:52:42 Evans: Roger. Current tracking indicates that the Service Module - the command/servicee module will trail the S-IVB at 14ge! By about 30 miles. So if we go ahead and do this upcoming maneuver, we will yield about nominal displacement a MC - MCC1. The S-IVB orbit on third day, however, yields a displacement between 63 and 87 miles if we go ahead and make the burn. And this was all based on beacon tracking, so it's pretty good. [Long pause.]
013:53:21 Schirra: Roger. [Pause.]
013:53:27 Cunningham (onboard): They think there's two guys in the LM; let's get to it.
013:53:31 Evans: Roger. We're working on the update, and we'll probably give it over Redstone. [Pause.]
013:53:37 Schirra: Okay.
013:53:39 Evans: Looks like the GETI is about 15 plus 52, though. [Pause.]

Mission Control at 13 hours 54 minutes Guaymas had LOS. The tracking ship Redstone in the South Pacific will acquire Apollo 7 at 14 hours 12 minutes 38 seconds. We'll be back at that time.
013:55:11 Cunningham (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7. Are you still monitoring the DSKY?
013:55:28 Cunningham (onboard): To save fuel [garble].
013:58:43 Schirra (onboard): The islands [garble] were the Marshall Islands.
014:06:30 Cunningham (onboard): Let's see. At 14 hours and 6 minutes into the flight, which is possibly 2½ hours after chlorination of the water, the water in the drinking guns does not taste very good after two squirts. In fact, tastes very bad.
Apollo Control at 14 hours, 12 minutes into the mission. The tracking ship Redstone is about to acquire Apollo 7. We'll stand by through this pass.

This is Mission Control. We have LOS at the Redstone now. During the initial part of this pass, we again had a weak signal strength problem. Didn't get communications with the spacecraft until several minutes into the pass. We passed up the information the crew will need to perform this little extra phasing maneuver that's planned at 15 hours, 52 minutes into the mission. It's required because the drag conditions of the S-IVB, the second stage of the launch vehicle are not as predicted premission and without this burn at the time of the first SPS burn tommorow and that's scheduled for 26 hours and 20 minutes. That's the first burn to in the rendezvous sequence. Without this (Garble) with it's coming up at the time that burn takes place, the S-IVB stage would trail. Correction - the command and Service Module would trail the S-IVB by about 30 miles. When what is needed is for the command and Service Module to be out ahead of the S-IVB. The nominal number is 75 miles and this second phasing maneuver coming up will place the CSM out ahead between 63 and 87 miles of the S-IVB which is still in good position for the MCC-1 or the first SPS burn at 26 hours 20 minutes tommorrow. Apollo 7 will be acquired by the Ascension station at 14 hours, 39 minutes. This is Mission Control at 14 hours, 24 minutes.
This is Mission Control at 14 hours, 26 minutes. This upcoming phasing maneuver will be a burn of 6 and a half feet per second. Propellant cost will be about 27 pounds it is estimated. But even though this is a nonplanned burn and the Flight Plan, there is enough RCS pad in the propellant budget to handle this burn and it will not affect the mission. This is Mission Control.
This is Mission Control at 14 hours, 39 minutes. Ascension has acquired at the Apollo 7 spacecraft. We will stand by.
ASCENSION (REV 10)
014:42:33 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Pause.]
014:42:37 Cunningham: Roger, Houston. This is Apollo 7. How do you read this time?
014:42:40 Evans: Roger. Loud and clear this time, Walt. We plan to reservice the evaporator and then shut it down. [Pause.]
014:42:50 Cunningham: 52 0000 NA 1647 plus 1202 00065 32445 NA 019 181 276 001. And I copied all the realign. [Long pause.]
014:43:18 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Say again the GTI.
014:43:21 Cunningham: Roger. GTI is 015 52 0000. [Pause.]
014:43:30 Evans: Roger. Your readback is correct. 7, Houston. The steps on reservicing the shutdown are real good. Reference information; make sure you have them. Lock all the back steam pressure practically AUTO to MANUAL. Steam pressure INCREASE switch, INCREASE for 45 seconds. Glycol is at - H2O flow ON for 2 minutes and then center. [Pause.]
014:43:38 Cunningham: Roger. You know I have already done that twice in the past, and if you notice now that steam pressure is unhooked and come back up. It seems to come up whenever the glycol evaporator outlet temperature gets down pretty cool like during the night. Do you want me to continue in going to MANUAL, INCREASE 45 seconds, and reservice the water evaporator? [Long pause.]
014:44:26 Evans: Affirmative. We just want to reservice it now and then chut it down. [Pause.]
014:44:32 Cunningham: Roger.
014:44:33 Evans: The idea, Walt, is that the radiators will carry a load without the primary evaporator on the line. [Long pause.]
014:45:26 Cunningham: I don't think we have any manual control over the steam pressure. I am going to service the water flowing now. [Pause.]
014:45:36 Evans: Roger. [Long pause.]
014:46:10 Cunningham: Wally seems to have a pretty bad head cold. He took two aspirins about 15 minutes ago, and he has been blowing his nose. [Long pause.]
014:46:21 Evans: Walt, say again. I missed, that. [Pause.]
014:46:25 Cunningham: Wally has a pretty stuffed-up head here. He took two aspirins about 15 minutes ago and has been blowing his nose pretty much all day long. [Long pause.]
014:46:41 Evans: Roger. We understand. [Pause.]
014:46:46 Cunningham: We would like to check on [garble]. [Long pause.]
014:47:12 Evans: About 1 minute until LOS there, Walt. We just want to make sure that you realize we are trying to shut down evaporator, and we think the radiator will carry the load. [Pause.]
014:47:22 Cunningham: Roger. See you all later [garble].
Very long comm break.
014:47:51 Unknown crewman (onboard): What he said is incomplete.
[Riley] This is Mission Control. We have had LOS at Ascension. Next station to acquire will be the Mercury at 15 hours, 15 minutes. The Apollo 7 at the time of this phasing maneuver at 15 hours 52 minutes will be in contact with the Redstone. At 14 hours, 48 minutes, this is Mission Control.
014:55:27 Cunningham (onboard): Magazine M, frame 22 taken at 14 hours and 55 minutes into flight.
014:59:22 Cunningham (onboard): At 14 hours 59 minutes into the flight, the magazine P, as in Peter, frame 22 was taken of the Sinai Peninsula on the Gulf of Aqaba, and frame 24 was taken in the same general area.
015:02:07 Cunningham (onboard): At 15:02:07, I photographed off the mainland of coastal India [garble] I think, an island of some great length; frame 27, magazine P as in Peter. The last one was - may be an island off the coast of - Gulf of Omni.
015:05:59 Cunningham (onboard): The island with the smoke coming off of it was in the Persian Gulf.
This Apollo Control at 15 hours and 15 minutes into the mission. Apollo 7 is coming up within range of the Mercury tracking ship now. Guam again has overlapping coverage here so we'll stand by through both of these stations for any communications.
MERCURY (REV 10)
015:16:35 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. I can give you time hack at 35 minutes prior to the burn. Four, three, two, one. [Long pause.]
015:17:00 Evans: MARK.
015:17:01 Evans: Thirty-five minutes.
015:17:03 Cunningham: That's 35, wasn't it?
015:17:05 Evans: Affirmative, 35. [Pause.]
015:17:14 Cunningham: - around - here at the glycol evaporator, and we have the steam pressure in MANUAL and the water flow OFF, but that last bit of servicing I did seemed to do a good bit of increase in the steam pressure. [Long pause.]
015:17:31 Evans: Hoger. Undarstand. The last bit of servicing increased the steam pressure? [Pause.]
015:17:36 Cunningham: Yes. That last 2 minutes worth brought the steam pressure up right handily. Right now I'm reading about .23 on the steam pressure. [Long pause.]
015:17:50 Evans: Roger. [Long pause.]
015:18:08 Evans: Walt, we concur with that. That's okay.
015:18:11 Schirra: That's good news. Yes.
015:18:14 Evans: Roger. Is there am MD type there, or do you still have those experimental doctors there? [Long pause.]
015:18:26 Evans: They're watching and waiting.
015:18:29 Schirra: You know I asked about taking a decongestant or antibiotic. [Long pause.]
015:18:47 Evans: Roger. Stand by. I wasn't aware of that, Wally; I'll get the word on it. [Pause.]
015:18:54 Schirra: Didn't you get the word that Walt passed back earlier? I've taken two aspirin. [Long pause.]
015:19:07 Evans: Say again. I think that was in the garbled part that we couldn't make out. Say again the problem. [Pause.]
015:19:12 Schirra: I have a nose cold. I've already gone through about eight or nine Kleenexes with some pretty good blows. I've taken two aspirin, and I am wondering if there is anything else I could take? [Long pause.]
015:19:26 Evans: Roger. [Long pause.]
015:19:40 Cunningham: I'd like to find out your druthers on the water boiler after that last servicing. If we're going to leave it off for a while - because you know we don't really need it - I'd still sometime in the future like to run it again. I'm not sure but what it's not worklng right now. [Long pause.]
015:20:32 Evans: Walt, this is kind of what we expected in this condition with them not running, and what we'd like to do is try to rev, at least a rev anyhow, with the EVAP off the line. [Long pause.]
015:20:45 Cunningham: Roger. Whatever you say.
Comm break.
015:22:34 Evans: Wally, Houston here. The good doctors are recommending that you take one Actifed or the Code Echo. [Long pause.]
015:22:46 Schirra: A decongestant; is that it? [Pause.]
015:22:50 Evans: That's affirmative. That's what it is. [Pause.]
015:22:55 Schirra: Okay.
Comm break.
GUAM (REV 10)
015:24:16 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. We want to take a look at the PIPA biases. We'd like you to remain in P47 for awhile after the burn on the Redstone pass. [Long pause.]
015:24:29 Schirra: Okay.
Comm break.
015:27:02 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause.]
015:27:06 Cunningham: Go ahead.
015:27:07 Evans: Roger. It looks like we're going to have to have one final request after the burn here. Our calculations shows that our waste water is going to be 85 percent at about 19 hours and we're not sure whether Donn can hook up all this good deal stuff in the middle of your guys' sleep period, so it's kinda at your discretion - whether you want to dump it prior to going to bed or let Donn dump it sometime around 19 hours. [Long pause.]
015:27:31 Unknown crewman: Roger. It's all been hooked up now. We have that urine dump hose hooked up at one end all the time. It's a simple job for one fellow without disturbing us, but I had mentioned - at least to Deke - about putting that waste water tank on up to more like 95 percent so you don't have to have quite as high an activity dumping it all the time. [Long pause.]
015:28:01 Evans: We're kinda agreeing with you in a way, and yet we'd kinda like to let it run up to the full [garble] point a little later on in the mission than in the early part of the mission. [Long pause.]
015:28:16 Unknown crewman: [Garble] Okay. We do have a gage [garble] 5 percent up above 90 - without too much strain if we can get around to it.
Comm break.
015:29:18 Evans: Walt, I think we can give you probably an actual number a little later on in the mission here when we figure out how much fuel cells are dumping in the water in and all these good deal things. [Long pause.]
015:29:29 Cunningham: Okay.
Very long comm break.
This is Mission Control. Guam as LOS. The tracking ship Redstone in the South Pacific will acquire Apollo 7 at 15 hours 47 minutes 58 seconds. That RCS phasing maneuver is due to take place 15 hours 52 minutes. At 15 hours 30 minutes, this is Mission Control.
015:32:33 Eisele (onboard): Now, that's a good sign. How are they doing? Booger's right up there.

015:36:24 Eisele (onboard): It's in the bag? Okay.
015:36:57 Eisele (onboard): Yes.
015:37:28 Eisele (onboard): Did you find out anything? Did it stratify?
015:37:59 Eisele (onboard): Yes, okay. What did the...
015:38:31 Eisele (onboard): 260 [garble] 19. Uh huh. Okay.
015:38:41 Eisele (onboard): Yes. Okay.
015:38:55 Eisele (onboard): Well, that one meter reads a little low too, as I remember. Doesn't it?
015:39:11 Eisele (onboard): Alright. You're not going to monkey with the water boiler, I gather, just let things go as they are?
015:39:47 Eisele (onboard): What did you say? What's going on? The glycol EVAP broke?
015:40:09 Eisele (onboard): Okay.
015:40:19 Eisele (onboard): Yes. Okay. Wait a minute.
015:41:22 Eisele (onboard): When do we do that burn?
015:41:40 Eisele (onboard): Okay, let's see what we're getting [garble].
015:41:57 Eisele (onboard): Okay [garble].
015:42:06 Eisele (onboard): Yes.
015:42:37 Eisele (onboard): Huh? As I understand it, we're pitching back.
This is Mission Control at 15 hours, 47 minutes in the mission. We are coming within range of the Redstone now. We are 4 minutes away from the burn. We will standby through this pass.

This is Mission Control, 15 hours 56 minutes. Redstone has had LOS. The Guidance Officer here in the Control Center affirms that that burn looked good here. And as you heard Wally Schirra and Walt Cunningham are preparing for their sleep period now. We will have a very low elevation pass at the Canary station at 16 hours 21 minutes 39 seconds. This is Mission Control.
This Apollo Control 16 hours 20 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We are coming up on acquisition point with Canary Islands in about a minute and a half from now. We will listen in although it is possible that we won't hear anything at that time. The sleep period for the spacecraft commander Schirra and LM pilot Cunningham has begun now. Only about 10 minutes off their schedule. And that was due to the phasing RCS burn of the Service Module. The result of that burn is 83 to 98 nautical miles it will be 83 to 98 miles ahead of the S-IVB at the time of the first SPS burn tomorrow. The next thing to do with the ECS water tank dump schedule is 19 hours into the mission. It will be scheduled for 28 minutes to dump an appropriate amount of water overboard from the spacecraft from the ECS water tank and that can be managed by the one pilot who will be awake at that time.

This is Apollo Control, 17 hours 32 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We have the next contact coming up and will be with Canary Islands at 17 hours 55 minutes 11 seconds into the mission. During this pass, we heard passed up the words P00 that the Command Module computer was confirmed to be in an idling mode. From that idling mode, then they passed in a verb and a noun which meant to enter digital entry into the computer to test the pulse integrating pendulous accelerometer to see how it was operating. We also had a report that 75 percent now is the readout on the amount of waste tank water instead of 40 percent. It still stands that at 19 hours the Command Module pilot will dump 28 minutes worth of water from that waste tank. At 17 hours 33 minutes into the mission. This is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 17 hours 52 minutes into the mission. We are coming up on Canary Islands again. We should have acquisition at 17:53:11. And that will last for some 7 1/2 minutes. We will tie into that live. We now have an apogee of 164.4 nautical miles and perigee of 120.1 nautical miles. The spacecraft commander and the Command Module pilot are sleeping and lunar - excuse me - the lunar module pilot is sleeping and the Command Module pilot is awake at this time. There is nothing in the Flight Plan of activity until 19 hours into the mission when he will dump the excess water from the waste tank for 28 minutes. At this time, let's see if we have any contact with Canary Islands.

This is Apollo Control; 19 hours, 7 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We had a little bit of difficulty there. Astronaut Pogue was unsuccessful for a minute or so to make contact because the Redstone ship was having some trouble locking up on the voice signal. However, did make contact and the discussion among other things concerned calrification on the biomedical harness where the readouts during the Control Center on high grade, etc. and as of now it is not functioning. Although the medical people say that the power in the equipment is working satisfactorily. So it must be some other problem. Possibly on board. At 19 hours 7 minutes 54 seconds into the mission, this is Apollo Control.

We have the good possibility of live television coming from the spacecraft which will be released that will be roughly about 10 am Central Time tomorrow morning. Correction, this morning would be around the end of the fifteenth revolution. Eisele also reported hearing spurious radio signals. He indicated that it was a radio program and he was getting a hot tip on hospital insurance plans from somebody whereupon astronaut Pogue said maybe they are trying to tell you something and Eisele retorted with maybe they know something I don't.

At that time we may get some conversation from Cap Com here at MCC and the spacecraft quoting the Flight Plan which is not changed to this time. Shortly after the contact, we are scheduled to have an IMU initial measurement unit realignment using a matrix and it will also at that time they will obtain drift data on the initial gyro and the guidance system. We have several seconds, about 30 seconds to go before initial contact with Carnarvon. At this time we'll switch over and join such conversation as there may be.

020:08:13 Eisele: Roger. I was just doing a little star examination here at sunset with the sun at my back, so to speak, and you can see stars - quite a few - out the telescope; however, the minute you move the telescope controls, a lot of shiny white particles flutter out, and they obscure the field of view. I know what that is; apparently, these particles are some moisture in the optics assembly that get out when you're moving around in shaft motion, and they go out and obscure what you're looking at if the sum is shining on them. [Long pause.]
020:08:50 Pogue: Roger. I understand that you can see stars in the telescope okay with the sun at your back; however, when you move, the optics in shaft - their white particles come off and sort of cloud the view. [Long pause.]
020:09:05 Eisele: That's right. Looks like it's snowing out there, and it would he impossible to do any kind of useful alignment with a situation like that. Also, at times when the Sun is more direct on the side where the optics are, it appears to be either a lot of light leak or Sun shining reflecting down inside the optics assembly, but except at near sundown with the sun at the opposite side from the optics, you just don't see anything when you look out there. You just see a big blur of light. [Long pause.]
020:09:44 Pogue: Roger. I understand that you apparently have something that looks like a light leak when the sun is directly on the side of the - is that the side of the spacecraft Where the optics are located? [Long pause.]
020:09:56 Eisele: Oh, I don't know if it's directly on that side or not; it's kind of hard to tell, but at times when the Sun is up and we get some random drifting attitude here, I've looked in to see if I could see anything, and it was just near impossible. There was just a lot of light in the telescope. It had the appearance of a light leak around - somewhere in the assembly. I don't know if that's true or not or perhaps, it's just the reflection coming in, but it makes it hard to see anything. [Long pause.]
020:10:26 Pogue: Roger. [Long pause.]

This is Apollo Control at 20 hours, 39 minutes into the flight of Apollo 7. To clarify what he aid before, it is possible the Flight Director is considering now in view of the fact that the PIPA, which is the pulsed integrating pendulour accelerometers mounted - there are three of them on each of the axis in the initial measuring unit in the Spacecraft and the Y-axis PIPA has been checked over the last many revolutions of the flight and it is possible that in order to check its operation more thoroughly that 1 minute RCS burn would, in an out of plane Y-axis would be utilized and if that were utilized, it would be similar between the 22 and 23 hour of the mission. This was not passed to the crew by Cap Com at this time, it's still under consideration and there's nothing of any alarm, certainly; but we will keep you posted on the progress of that situation. At 20 hours, 41 minutes into the flight of Apollo 7, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 20 hours 50 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We are coming up on Mila acquisition in Florida and we should have some conversation. That position should be 20:50:19 5 seconds ago. So let's join the conversation.

020:50:57 Eisele: Houston, this is Apollo 7. Go.
020:50:59 Pogue: Donn, I would like to brief you all on something that has come up here, and it has to do with the Y PIPA. Statement is made that based on telemetry readouts, we feel or suspect that Y PIPA counts are not getting into the CMC. We've been monitoring practically zero. Now this is still sort of in ferment, but it looks like now they would like to have an RCS burn completed to perform a check on the Y PIPA's. If so, this will be done on the next rev over Texas.
Comm break.
020:52:04 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. This would be a sort of small burn plus Y, then minus Y, then total DELTA-V about 5 feet per second. [Long pause.]
020:52:15 Eisele: Bill, I missed practically your whole transmission, and all I heard was that you had something for me, and then you said something about a small burn. Would you run it by again, please? [Long pause.]
020:52:27 Pogue: Roger. Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read now? [Pause.]
020:52:31 Eisele: Roger. It's loud end clear.
020:52:33 Pogue: Right. Based on telemetry readouts, we suspect the Y-axis, Y-axis PIPA counts are not getting into the CMC. In order to check this out, we would like to do a small RCS translation plus Y and then minus Y. Total test will consume about 10 pounds of fuel, and it's proposed that this be performed at 22 plus 23 and will be over Texas on your next pass. [Long pause.]
020:53:12 Eisele: Okay. Twenty-two plus 23; you will want a plus Y and a minus X. Do you want us to have a program up like 47, then? [Pause.]
020:53:21 Pogue: Okay. I'll go through the procedure that is proposed here now. Step 1, we would like to - the test to be done in P00; also, we would like to have A/C roll ENABLED. Then the attitude would be roll 180, pitch 326, and yaw zero. With that attitude, we would like a plus Y translation for 7 seconds, then turn the A/C roll back off.
020:53:23 Eisele: Wait a second, just hold the phone. You want P00, you want A/C roll ENABLED, I got 180, 3260 roll; and after that, I was replying on that, but you were talking. Would you say again all that after the attitude? [Long pause.]
020:53:35 Pogue: Roger. Sorry about, that. I will go a little bit slower. Roger. I'll go back over it. You got it copied correctly. We do want it in P00, and we would like the SCS channel A/C roll ENABLED also for the test. Attitude, roll 180, pitch 326, yaw zero. With that attitude, translate plus Y 7 seconds; then wait 30 seconds, 30 seconds; then translate minus Y for 7 seconds; then turn the A/C roll channel back off.
Comm break.
020:55:41 Eisele: Roger. You have a terrible squeal in there, Bill; I don't know what it is. I understand, and you want plus Y for 7 seconds, then pause 30 seconds, then minus Y 7 seconds. Now at what time again did you want this, 22 plus how many? [Long pause.]
020:55:57 Pogue: We would like that at 22 hours and 23 minutes. That will be over Texas. [Pause.]
020:56:04 Eisele: Okay. I guess we can do that. Just out of curiosity, what do you hope to prove by having only P00 going? That won't - certainly won't put into the same vector if you do that. [Long pause.]
020:56:18 Pogue: Well, actually what we want to do is monitor your PIPA's and see if in fact they are feeding informarion into the computer. [Pause.]
020:56:28 Eisele: I see. [Pause.]

This is Apollo Control, 21 hours, 11 minutes, 42 seconds into the mission of Apollo 7. As you heard on that communication between Cap Com and Apollo 7, the Flight Director, Jerry Griffin has decided that we need an RCS burn to a minimal burn to check the PIPA or the accelerometer, pulsed integrating pendulous accelerometer counts onboard the Spacecraft. This burn will take place at 22 hours, 23 minutes into the mission. The reason that it is based on telemetery readouts, the PIPA or accelerometer counts may not be getting into the Command Module Computer. Now, this particular Y-axis accelerometer, if you can imagine the Astronauts lying on their couch, the Y-axis would go from hip to hip. So this accelerometer would measure velocity changes and translation along the axis, not around the axis. Therefore, an RCS burn would will take place 22 hours, 23 minutes into the mission and it will be in IMUP, that is the platform, the IMU platform, will be idling, roll 180 degrees, pitch 326 degrees, yaw 0; and they will burn on that Y-axis, along the Y-axis a translation burn for 7 seconds and they will wait for 30 seconds, then they will burn on -Y the other way along the axis for another 7 seconds, and then here in the control center, they will readout whether or not the PIPA counts are getting into the Command Module computer, if it influences the PIPA readouts. At 21 hours, 14 minutes into the mission, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 21 hours 37 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We are about 10 seconds away from acquisition at Carnarvon, Australia, so lets join what conversation there may be.

021:39:18 Eisele: Roger. Houston, Apollo 7. Go.
021:39:20 Pogue: Roger. AOS Carnarvon. I also have an advisory. We're monitoring 90 percent - 90 percent on waste water now, and we'd like to get a dump whenever - as soon as it is convenient. [Long pause.]
021:39:36 Eisele: Okay. Wally is still in the sack. As soon as he's up, we'll dump it; and meanwhile, I'm starting to maneuver around to the attitude for that little test maneuver you want to do. [Pause.]
021:39:46 Pogue: Roger. Thank you.
Long comm break.
021:45:59 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. We have about a little over 1 minute to LOS Carnarvon. Request S-band volume up, please. [Long pause.]
021:46:11 Eisele: Roger. S-band Volume going up.
021:46:14 Pogue: Thank you. [Long pause.]
This is Apollo Control 21 hours 45 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. Evidently we'll have no more conversation on our Australian pass. On this revolution, 14th revolution, going - well, correct that, the 15th, the beginning of the 15th revolution we will have the Service Module RCS burn to test the accelerometer and to get a readout hopefully on whether or not the accelerometer counts are getting into the Command Module computer. This is to be done at 22 hours 23 minutes over Texas. At 21 hours 46 minutes, this is Apollo Control.

021:47:35 Cunningham: Okay. Fine. Hey, Bill? [Pause.]
021:47:42 Pogue: Roger. Go. [Pause.]
021:47:48 Eisele: Roger. A couple of hours ago - I neglected to tell you before that, and I'm sorry - we had an anomaly up here. We got an AC bus 1 drop out, and all we did was reset it, and it kept on running; and we never did see anything anomalous other than that, other then we confirm that the voltage has dropped off and the inverter had come off the line apparently. [Long pause.]
021:48:10 Pogue: Okay. You had an AC bus 1 drop out. You reset it, and it was okay, but you did confirm it was a bona fide malfunction because the voltage did drop. [Long pause.]
021:48:21 Eisele: That's right. All three phases were - well, were pegged on the bottom of the meter, and all we did was hit RESET and punch the warning lights off, and it kept right on running. [Long pause.]
021:48:33 Pogue: Okay. Thank you very much. That is copied.
021:48:36 Eisele: Okay. We've had no trouble with it since. Everything's been normal.

This is Apollo Control; 21 hours, 54 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We had further CapCom communication with the crew of Apollo 7 over Australia and it is taped and I would like to bring it to you now.
021:54:03 Eisele (onboard): [Garbled] Apollo 7. Over.
021:54:10 Eisele (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7. Over.
This is Apollo Control. That concluded our Australian pass. Our next contact will be on our stateside pass coming over Texas and at 22 hours 23 minutes we will have a burn over Texas of the RCS Service Module engines and that will test the pulse integrating pendulous accelerometer status in the spacecraft. The Flight Director is concerned that possibly this accelerometer, the counts from the accelerometer may not be getting into the Command Module computer. The command pilot and the LM pilot are due to be awakened in a matter of moments on the hour and we should be in contact with Texas and the spacecraft at 22 hours 19 minutes 52 seconds. At 21 hours 57 minutes this is Apollo Control.
021:57:34 Cunningham (onboard): This is LMP. At 21 hours, 40 minutes [garble] defecation. I'm going to make a few subjective comments about it and, I trust [garble].
021:58:02 Cunningham (onboard): I did attach the urine collection device and voided myself at the same time. I noticed my general language on the [garble]
021:58:15 Cunningham (onboard): At any rate, on that - there are several problems have come up that we hadn't particularly expected. One is the constant wear garment. In addition to that, there's nothing really large enough to accommodate the bag. It makes it quite messy when it springs back after completion of a defecatlon. The other alternative is to take the - the constant wear garment off the shoulders and put it down around your knees. Now, in order to do that, you have to disconnect the BIOMED sensors, which are not color coded incidentally, and the - very difficult for them to hook them all back up to the right place [garble].
021:59:12 Cunningham (onboard): Other than that, the problems are really surprisingly few. I voided myself simultaneously, dumped the urine collection. Cleaning myself up, I had relatively little mess. I utilized two of the tissues, each of which were used, folded, used again, and then used a third tissue which had earlier been soaked with water from the water gun, cleaning up rather well, and then went ahead and used the wet-wipe that is provided. It's worth noting that those wet-wipes that come in the fecal bag do not have any Velcro on them for attaching to the wall, and that's a definite handicap.
This is Apollo Control at 22 hours, 19 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. At this time, we do not have contact, but we will with the Spacecraft at 22 hours, 1952. The Spacecraft Commander and the LM Pilot should have been awakened on the hour, 19 minutes and 27 seconds ago. There was a lithium hydroxide change scheduled, the second change scheduled in the Flight Plan, which we assumed has taken place. At 22 hours, 23 minutes, we are coming up on the Service Module RCS reaction control system burn to test the accelerometers in the IMU. We now have contact with the Spacecraft. Lets join the conversation.

This is Apollo Control, 22 hours 34 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. In that pass over the United States, we completed the service propulsion system RCS burn. We gave them an update on the amount of propellant left in the RCS system and we confirmed that the waste water percentage is down to 47.2 percent in quantity, where it had been 85 percent. So the dump was satisfactory and the burn was satisfactory for the PIPA check. To repeat, the purpose of the burn that was not originally scheduled in the Flight Plan was based on the fact that the flight director was concerned because the PIPA which is the pulse integerating pendulous accelerometer in the instrument measuring unit and the guidance and navigation system on the spacecraft. They were concerned that the accelerometer counts may not be getting into the Command Module computer. This is an integral part of the guidance and navigation system. There are three such accelerometers mounted in the instrument measuring unit and they measure along all three axes, X, Y, and Z. This particular accelerometer that was in question was the Y axis accelerometer and that accelerometer has now proven from ground readouts to be operational. The next contact we will have is with Canary Islands, 22 hours 37 minutes into the mission. It is now shortly a little less than one minute from this time so we will switch over for any further communication from the spacecraft.

This is Apollo Control; 22 hours, 45 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. That concludes our pass. The next contact will be Tananarive; 22 hours, 59 minutes, 39 seconds; some 14 minutes from now. We have a Go for 33 revolutions. Things look good on the spacecraft right now. This is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control; 22 hours, 59 minutes in the mission of Apollo 7. At this time I believe we will give a rundown of the activities since roughly 8 hours ago. At 15 hours, 23 minutes; astronaut Schirra requested permission to take one decongestant tablet. He had taken two aspirin earlier. The problem seemed to be that his nose was stopped up and he had gone, as he had said, through several Kleenexes, and at that time he was told to take a decongestant tablet. We then had an unscheduled, up to that - shortly before that time, an RCS Service Module burn. Then the commander and the LM pilot entered a sleep period at 15 hours, 52 minutes into the mission. The reason for the RCS burn was to position the Command and Service Module, some 26 hours into the mission, or 3 hours from now, roughly, well ahead of the S-IVB stage of the booster, which it will rendezvous with at that period in the flight. We will turn out to be, after that burn, 85 to 98 nautical miles ahead of the S-IVB at the time of the first Service Propulsion System burn, so it was a highly successful burn. Then we had a situation where excess water from the Enviromental Control System, primary system waste tank was looked at closely and it turned out that it had to be dumped. Several minutes ago it was accomplished and it went from 85 percent down to some 45 - 47 percent, which is a most acceptable level in the waste tank. We have had some problem with the biomedical harness, which didn't seem to operate and 18 hours, 58 minutes into the mission, it came up and it was indicated by the Command Module Pilot Eisele that he had checked the harness but still on the ground no signal was coming into the Control Center on biomedical readout. So the doctor, Dr. Beers here in the Control Center, indicated that the equipment was working okay and he had to assume that the trouble was somewhere in the spacecraft. At that time, the water tank quantity was building up and had reached 78 percent and it stayed right around that quantity until, as I say, a short while ago it was dumped. It took some 28 minutes to dump it down to around 47 percent. We had Flight Plan update 19 hours, 17 minutes into the mission. We then had it confirmed that the television was scheduled for the Texas pass at some 23 hours, 53 minutes into the mission. At that time, Eisele reported receiving spurious signals. It was a radio program. As he said a hot tip on hospital insurance plans from somebody. Eisele reported 20 hours, 8 minutes into the mission that the telescope when he was in darkness with the Sun behind, he could see the stars fine, but when the object was moved, snowy white particles appeared as he said like a snow storm. He also noticed some Sun shining down the barrel of their telescope at certain times. He did not know the exact position of the Sun when that happened. We're in a situation 20 hours, 29 minutes into flight when the Flight Director Griffin came to the conclusion that the accelerometer in the Inertial Measuring Unit that on the Y-axis possibly was not functioning properly and that the counts possibly were not getting into the Command Module Computer. He then determined that we should have an out-of-plane burn, an RCS - Reaction Control System on the Service Module - burn in the Y-axis that's laterally of - and that the burn would be 7 seconds plus Y and 7 seconds minus Y with a 30 second space in between. Would be a total of about, as it turned out, a 5-foot per second burn. That was passed to the crew and that burn did take place and it did prove that the accelerometer in the inertial measuring unit was not malfunctioning and was checked out here on the ground as working properly. It was then concluded and confirmed that the waste water tank dump was completed, confirmed on the ground - the exact quantity remaining as of now is, or a short while ago, 47.2 percent quantity in the waste water tank in the Environmental Control System. We then got a Go a very short while ago; 22 hours, 30 minutes into the mission; a Go for 33 revolutions. We then had Service Module Reaction Control System readout on quantities. Quad A, we have 86.7 percent left; Quad B, we have 91 percent of the propellant left; Quad C, 85 percent left; and Quad D, 90 percent left. That's the status as of now at 23 hours, 5 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. This is Apollo Control.

023:00:32 Unknown crewman: Houston, Apollo 7. How do you read me?
023:00:35 Swigert: I read you five-by. How me? [Pause.]
023:00:39 Schirra: Roger. Reading you fine. Over.
023:00:41 Swigert: Okay. Wally, I've got a T-align time for you I'd like to pass up. We've got a short pass here. [Pause.]
023:00:48 Schirra: Go with it.
023:00:49 Swigert: Roger. T align. 23 plus 24 plus 08 00. [Long pause.]
023:01:00 Schirra: Twenty-three plus 24 plus 08 00. Over. [Pause.]
023:01:04 Swigert: Roger. That's correct. Now, concerning the matter of the television, there's been considerable discussion here in the center. The Flight Director wants you to turn on the television at the appropriate time. [Long pause.]
023:01:35 Schirra: Walt will be on the air shortly. [Long pause.]
023:01:53 Swigert: Okay. Wally, after this, I've got MCC-1 PAD I'd like to give you, and if I can't give it here, I will give it over Carnarvon. [Pause.]
023:02:02 Cunningham: Roger. Go with it. [Long pause.]
023:02:15 Cunningham: Go with your maneuver PAD.
023:02:18 Swigert: Let's wait first and get Wally's comments on the television. [Long pause.]
023:02:33 Swigert: Okay, Walt. We'll go ahead with the MCC-1 PAD here.
023:02:36 Cunningham: I'm ready to copy. Go.

CARNARVON (REV 15)
023:13:30 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause.]
023:13:38 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7. Go ahead.
023:13:41 Swigert: Roger. Wally, I'd like to finish the MCC-1 PAD, and could you tell me how far you copied before we got LOS Tananarive? [Long pause.]
023:13:55 Schirra: Roger. Jack, I got 25 hours and 41 minutes on the NAV check. I didn't get the seconds. Conttnue after that. [Pause.]
023:14:04 Swigert: Okay. Seconds - starting at the seconds; 5500 plus 2766 minus 05376 1226 359 284 359. You have the T align of 23 plus 24 plus 08 00. [Long pause.]
023:14:34 Schirra: Roger. The T align was 23 plus 24 plus 08 00, MCC1 26 24 5510 plus 00617 minus 00010 plus 01985 1960 plus 1243 01978 32398 minus 090 minus 030 010 35 1981 151 025 41 5500 minus 2766 minus 05376 1226 359 284 359. Over. [Long pause.]
023:15:18 Swigert: Roger, It's correct except the Noun 43 the latitude; the sign should be plus 2766. [Pause.]
023:15:27 Schirra: Roger. I have plus here.
023:15:30 Swigert: Okay. You got it. [Pause.]
023:15:35 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
023:15:37 Swigert: Go ahead, Wally.
023:15:40 Schirra: Roger. You've added two burns to this flight schedule, and you've added a urine water dump; and we have a new vehicle up here, and I can tell you this point TV will be delayed without any further discussion until after the rendezvous. [Long pause.]
023:15:59 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
023:16:02 Schirra: Roger. [Pause.]
023:16:07 Slayton: Apollo 7. This is CapCom number 1. [Pause.]
023:16:14 Schirra: Roger.
023:16:17 Slayton: All we've agreed to do on this is flip it.
023:16:18 Schirra: [Garble] with two commanders, Apollo 7. [Pause.]
023:16:23 Slayton: All we have agreed to on this particular pass is to flip the switch on. No other activity associated with TV; I think we are still obligated to do that. [Pause.]
023:16:33 Schirra: We do not have the equipment out; we have not had an opportunity to follow setting; we have not eaten at this point. At this point, I have a cold. I refuse to foul up our time lines this way.
Comm break.
023:17:45 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Could we have opposite omni please and your PMP power to OX? [Pause.]
023:17:54 Unknown crewman: PMP going to OX now. [Pause.]
023:18:02 Unknown crewman: Hey, Jack. They left us without that tape recorder running again on the last, - after the last pass. The problem we have here is I am hesitant to stop and Command Reset and start tape going because you might be in the middle of a dump that you want to continue later. So we really are left without nothing - I mean between passes at the - tape motions left barher pole like that. [Long pause.]
023:18:26 Swigert: Okay. We copy. [Long pause.]
023:18:45 Swigert: 7, Houston.
023:18:48 Cunningham: Go ahead.
023:18:49 Swigert: Walter, the reason the - you lost - you had the tape recorder at barber pole when you left Canaries; we had a power loss at Canaries just before LOS, and we didn't get the command to you. It shouldn't happen again; everybody has been briefed on the proper operation there. [Long pause.]
023:19:10 Cunningham: Okay, Jack. I understand. I guess - I am going to assume if it's barbar poled after we have left contact with you, then it's running in a forward direction and ready to record. Jack, can you verify that? [Long pause.]
023:19:25 Swigert: Stand by. Let me get the word from EECOM. [Pause.]
023:19:32 Swigert: Okay. Walt, EECOM says that is - that assumption of yours is correct. [Pause.]
023:19:40 Cunningham: Thank you, and for your information down there, I have yet to activate the EPS line heaters. They have been off ever since liftoff. The temperature seems to be holding very, very constant at 70, and I verified that with the oxidizing feedline temperature, also. [Long pause.]
023:19:57 Swigert: Okay. Real fine.
023:20:00 Cunningham: And did you ever get the Command Module RCS temperatures down there during the night? [Pause.]
023:20:07 Swigert: Yes, we did. Do you want them passed rap? [Pause.]
023:20:11 Cunningham: Negative. We are going to read those from time to time and pass them on to you. [Pause.]
023:20:15 Swigert: Okay. [Long pause.]
023:21:02 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We would like to have your TLM switch switched to LOW. [Long pause.]
023:21:14 Unknown crewman: [Garble] in RESET to stop the motion. [Long pause.]

This is Apollo Control Houston 23 hours 33 minutes into the flight of Apollo 7 with the spacecraft just pulling northeast of Australia. During the Australian pass, it was concluded that there would be no television transmission, I repeat no television transmission across the states in the next rev. A number of reasons are cited in the communication from Captain Schirra and here is the tape of the entire Australian pass now.
023:33:52 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
023:33:55 Unknown crewman: [Garble].
023:33:56 Swigert: Roger. Wally, I'd like to finish the MCC1 PAD, and can you tell me how far you copied before we got to LOS Tananarive? [Long pause.]
023:34:07 Schirra: Roger. Jack, I got 25 hours, 41 minutes of the NAP check; i didn't get the seconds to continue after that. [Pause.]
023:34:15 Swigert: Okay. Seconds [garble] 5500 plus 2766 minus 05376 1226 359 284 359. You have the key align 23 plus 24 plus 0800. [Long pause.]
023:34:44 Schirra: Roger. Key align 23 plus 24 plus 0800 MCC1 26 24 5510 plus 00617 minus 0010 plus 01985 1960 plus 1243 01978 32398 minus 090 minus 030 010 35 1981 151 025 41 5500 minus 2766 minus 05376 1226 359 284 359. Over. [Long pause.]
023:35:27 Swigert: Roger. It's correct except the Noun 43; the latitude sign should be plus 2766.

This is Apollo Control. Again repeat, there will be no television attempt, use of the television equipment made before the rendezvous attempt coming later in the day. And the revolutions are such that we would not then be able to attempt it until at least tomorrow and perhaps the next day. We are undecided right now whether to attempt a television pass tomorrow or not. In the course of the conversation regarding the use of the camera, you heard someone identifying himself as CapCom number 1, come in and PAO take the microphone. That was Donald Slayton. He, on the basis on his discussion with Wally Schirra - here in the Control Center it was concluded that we should not attempt the TV pass today. Prior to that there had been some feeling that we should go ahead and follow the general time line as closely as possible. This is a matter in which the Control Center decided they should accept the crew commanders judgement and that was that it would overload them to attempt before the rendezvous. The principal of additional work, it may sound simple just to turn on the TV camera, but it does mean a good deal of effort in setting light conditions and setting shades, pulling shades on five different windows and controlling the general level. I think that is the biggest order of difficulty. At 23 hours, 42 minutes into the flight; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
023:37:18 Cunningham (onboard): At 22 hours, 37 minutes into the flight, the O2 partial pressure is 200 mm of mercury.

This is Apollo Control Houston, 23 hours 51 minutes into the flight. The Guaymas station is due to [garble] we are due to acquire the spacecraft through Guaymas momentarily and this pass will bring the spacecraft across Mexico, across the northern Gulf of Mexico and cut across Florida, should be an active pass [garble] let's listen.
023:51:22 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
023:51:24 Unknown crewman: Go ahead, Houston.
023:51:27 Swigert: Roger. Wally, we have some information on your evaporator and ECS procedures for and during the rendezvous here. [Long pause.]
023:51:39 Swigert: We would like for you to stay in your present configuration using the primary system with the radiators. If the evaporator, or primary evaporator, or ALTI temperature goes higher than 60 degrees, we would like for you to activate the primary evaporator then. And if it doesn't work, we would like for you to reserviee that primary evaporator and shut it down. Activate the secondary coolant loop with the radiator bypass. [Long pause.]
023:52:10 Cunningham: Roger. Understand. Additional SOP and one question, did you say the glycol evaporator outlet temperature above 60 or the radiator outlet temperature above 60? Over. [Long pause.]
023:52:29 Swigert: Walt, the evaporator outlet temperature greater than 60. [Pause.]
023:52:33 Cunningham: Roger. Understand. Evaporator outlet greater than 60 and activate the primary water boiler; if it doesn't work again, I'll reservice it. Shut it down and activate secondary coolant loop with the radiator bypass. [Long pause.]
