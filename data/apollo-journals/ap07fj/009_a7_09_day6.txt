This is Apollo Control, Houston; 120 hours into the flight of Apollo 7. Through Tananarive we had this conversation.
CARNARVON (REV 76)
120:00:50 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Long pause]
120:01:27 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. Standing by. [Pause]
120:01:36 Schirra: Roger, Houston.
Comm break.
120:04:18 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7.
120:04:19 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
120:04:22 Cunningham: Roger. I've got the shaft at 115.33 and the trunnion at 31.707 for the sextant star check. [Long pause]
120:04:35 Swigert: Roger. We copied that, and, Walt, we would like your O2 fans tank 2 ON for 3 minutes.
Comm break.
120:05:51 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Your sextant star check is GO, and we would like to remind you to have turned the batteries OFF as soon as possible after the burn. [Long pause]
120:06:04 Cunningham: Wilco.
120:06:06 Schirra: Jack, we dia a - skip that - require, request an SCF attitude reference check at 119 hours and 30 minutes. I did that the other day and gave you an hour and 15 minute comparison. That data should be better than the check we've had a call for. [Long pause]
120:06:23 Swigert: Okay. We copy that.
120:06:26 Schirra: It's not that I didn't want to do it, but we did it for free when we had a good chance to do it. [Pause]
120:06:31 Swigert: Okay.
120:06:33 Schirra: That data should be in.
Comm break.
120:07:51 Swigert: Apollo 7. One minute LOS Carnarvon; Hawaii at 120 plus 25. [Pause]
120:07:59 Schirra: Roger.
120:08:01 Cunningham: The water boiler looks like it's ticking along okay, Jack. I think we can leave it on. [Pause]
120:08:05 Swigert: We concur. Looks good here.
Very long comm break.
HAWAII (REV 76)
120:26:15 Swigert: Apollo 7. Houston through Hawaii.
120:26:18 Schirra: Roger. Loud and clear. [Pause]
120:26:24 Swigert: Wally, we saw - as you went over the hill, we saw you looking at NOUN 54. Your R1 and R2 will be zero in that NOUN because the S-IVB and CSM speed vectors that we uplinked awhile back are the same. The CSM state vector is a good state vector. [Long pause]
120:26:49 Schirra: Roger.
120:26:52 Swigert: And we would like to have you turn O2 fans tank 1 off for the burn here. [Pause]
120:27:00 Schirra: Okay. That's tank 1 OFF and tank 2 OFF. Is that correct?
120:27:03 Swigert: That is affirmative.
120:27:06 Schirra: Okay. I'll turn tank 1 off now. [Long pause]
Apollo Control, Houston here; 120 hours, 27 minutes into the flight and we have acquired through Hawaii and here is what it sounds like.
120:27:52 Swigert: Apollo 7, all your systems and everything looks real good here on the ground. [Pause]
120:27:56 Schirra: Roger. We're GO.
120:27:59 Schirra: Jack, on this, we have flight plan seat assignment. [Pause]
You heard Schirra advise a moment ago that the seating was per the flight plan, that would be Donn Eisele in the left couch, Walt Cunningham in the center, and the commander, Wally Schirra in the right couch. They are prepped and ready for the minimum impulse burn to be performed at 120 hours, 43 minutes, about 13 minutes from now, which burn should take place over the states. Standing by.
120:28:08 Swigert: Roger. Copy that, Wally.
120:28:10 Schirra: That includes COMM connection as well. [Pause]
120:28:14 Swigert: Copy.
Long comm break.
120:32:05 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7. Over.
120:32:08 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
120:32:09 Cunningham: Roger. I forgot to give you a reading. I had 246 m of O2 partial pressure this morning. [Pause]
120:32:15 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control 120 hours, 30 minutes. It obviously is going to be pretty quiet until we get over the states. We will come back up to you then.
HUNTSVILLE (REV 76)
120:35:25 Communications Technician: Huntsville AOS.
Comm break.
120:36:27 Communications Technician: Huntsville AOS.
Comm break.
120:38:31 Schirra: Okay. We'll go on. Start pitch one and yaw one. [Pause]
120:38:36 Eisele: Pitch left. Start.
120:38:38 Schirra: ON.
120:38:39 Eisele: Yaw one. Start.
120:38:41 Schirra: On. [Pause]
120:38:45 Eisele: [Garble] properly. [Long pause]
120:39:01 Eisele: ON.
120:39:03 Schirra: GPI. [Long pause]
120:39:15 Eisele: Did. Receive? [Pause]
120:39:19 Schirra: It's verified.
120:39:20 Eisele: Pressure's neutral - 00 MPM.
120:39:23 Schirra: [Garble]. [Long pause]
120:39:36 Communications Technician: Huntsville LOS. [Long pause]
This is Apollo Control; 120 hours, 39 minutes into the flight. In about 3 minutes we expect the minimum impulse burn; it will be a burn with a duration of .4 seconds. Four tenths of a second. It is to impart a differential velocity of about 13 feet per second. The flight plan shows it at 12.9. The burn will be done in plane and the result in orbit should be 90 by 156 nautical miles. Presently in about 89 by 156. Schirra is advising the attitudes are all set up; let's tune in on some of that conversation.
GOLDSTONE through BERMUDA (REV 76)
120:39:57 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Could we have omni Able, please? [Long pause]
120:40:08 Eisele: I missed it.
120:40:09 Schirra: On my direct command [garble] attitudes, yaw three. Ready? Commence. [Pause]
120:40:16 Eisele: [Garble] like this. [Long pause]
120:40:41 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. I'll give you a time hack at 2 minutes. [Long pause]
120:40:55 Swigert: Five, four, three, two, one. [Pause]
120:41:00 Swigert: Mark.
120:41:01 Swigert: T minus 2 minutes.
120:41:02 Eisele: five-five.
120:41:04 Schirra: Five and five.
120:41:05 Schirra: DELTA V test A and B normal.
That's Wally Schirra calling off the items on the check list and Don Eisele responding to the check list. Schirra is over in the right seat, Cunningham in the center, Eisele on the left, and Eisele will manage the burn. Spacecraft is over Arizona.
120:41:08 Eisele: DELTA V test A and B normal.
Comm break.
120:42:29 Schirra: [Garble] DELTA-V, ON. [Pause]
120:42:34 Eisele: Roger. ON.
120:42:35 Schirra: And 20 seconds ullage.
120:42:37 Eisele: Roger. Ullage for 20. [Pause]
120:42:45 Eisele: Ullage. [Pause]
120:42:50 Swigert: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. [Long pause]
120:43:02 Schirra: [Garble]. [Pause]
120:43:10 Schirra: Gimbals OFF, [garble] OFF. [Pause]
120:43:16 Schirra: DELTA-V thrust [garble] OFF.
120:43:18 Eisele: DELTA-V [garble] OFF.
Our charts down here show that the ullage maneuver at 20 seconds worth is being performed using quads B and D 4, 3, 2, 1 - and we have here a shout which would indicate we had a burn.
120:43:20 Schirra: Okay. We've got 10 seconds [garble].
120:43:23 Eisele: Roger.
120:43:24 Schirra: [Garble].
120:43:26 Eisele: Okay [garble] residual minus [garble] balls 24 and [garble] four balls 1 at first. [Long pause]
All in all it sounds like a good burn.
120:43:38 Schirra: Gimbal motors OFF and gimbal motors circuit breakers OPEN. [Pause]
120:43:44 Schirra: [Garble] pover.
120:43:45 Eisele: Roger. Gimbal motor circuit breakers are OPEN, and [garble] power is OFF. [Pause]
120:43:50 Schirra: Direct RCS OFF.
120:43:51 Eisele: Direct RCS comming OFF.
120:43:53 Schirra: Main bus [garble] OFF. [Pause]
120:43:57 Eisele: Roger. In free drift, now in the slosh mode test. [Pause]
120:44:03 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
GOLDSTONE through BERMUDA (REV 77)
120:44:05 Cunningham: Did you copy my DSKY? Have you got the [garble] on that?
120:44:08 Swigert: Affirmative.
120:44:09 Schirra: [Garble] mode still OPEN. Stand by [garble] control. [Long pause]
120:44:20 Schirra: [Garble].
120:44:23 Eisele: [Garble] controls are locked.
120:44:24 Schirra: EMS OFF.
120:44:25 Eisele: OFF. EMS counter is reading minus 7.7. [Pause]
120:44:30 Swigert: Roger. Copy that. [Pause]
120:44:34 Eisele: That means it's been 15.3, I guess. [Pause]
120:44:38 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
120:44:53 Schirra: Believe it or not, we saw all four ball valves. [Pause]
120:44:59 Swigert: Roger. Say again, Wally?
120:45:02 Schirra: All four ball valves rolled - kind of a surprise in that short burn. [Pause]
120:45:06 Swigert: Okay.
Comm break.
As you can hear, it is all quiet in the loop after that successful burn. The spacecraft is right over New Orleans coming up on the Cape.
120:46:45 Schirra: Houston, we just checked our file battaries, and both are 30 second volts. [Pause]
120:46:49 Swigert: Roger. Thank you. [Long pause]
120:47:03 Cunningham: Jack, did you ever drive those little amusement park cars, those bumper things? [Pause]
120:47:10 Swigert: Say again.
120:47:11 Schirra: Those little scooter things: when you try to pass, you bump off the guard rails and crash into each other? That's the best analogy we can think of for that particular burn: like plunging head-on into somebody in one of those amusement park scooters. [Long pause]
120:47:26 Swigert: Oh, Roger. Roger. Copy that. We got a commanded ON time down here of .51 seconds. [Pause]
120:47:35 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
120:47:43 Swigert: Wally, how long has it been since you have been to an amusement park and done that? [Pause]
120:47:47 Schirra: I'm not going to tell.
120:47:49 Swigert: Roger.
120:47:50 Schirra: [Garble] age only a couple of days ago.
Comm break.
Perhaps it was a little hard to understand that transmission; Schirra has likened that little blip burn we just did to the impact that one gets at an amusement park in operating the little dodging cars - the kind that operate from an electrical source and bump into each other. A pretty good - brisk bump as I recall. He was asked when the last time he had operated one of those cars and he - his memory failed him. We'll keep the line open.
120:48:56 Schirra: Jack, we're going to re-rig our couch so we'll have one man on watch; two will be going off. [Long pause]
120:49:07 Swigert: Wally, we couldn't copy that. Could you say again?
120:49:10 Schirra: We are going to re-rig our couch seats and our [garble]. [Pause]
120:49:20 Swigert: We still couldn't get it, Wally.
120:49:23 Schirra: We are going to put the crew back into their original seat assignments.
120:49:26 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
Long comm break.
The Flight Dynamics Officer has computed the orbit resulting from that little blip burn a few minutes ago and he presently reads it at 90.3 by 157.5 nautical miles. 90.3 by 157.5.
120:52:47 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. You are one minute LOS Bermuda; we pick you up at Ascension at 121 plus 03. [Pause]
120:52:57 Schirra: Jack, I just could get our landmark PAD update. Over. [Pause]
120:53:02 Swigert: Roger. We have the landmark track PAD. I'll pass it up to you at Ascension. Your orbit now 90.3 by 157.5. [Long pause]
120:53:14 Schirra: All right. [Long pause]
120:53:48 Eisele: Hello, Air Boss. Hello, Air Boss. This is Apollo 7. Do you read? [Long pause]
120:54:10 Communications Technician: Roger. Read you loud and clear. How me? [Pause]
120:54:15 Eisele: We're overhead and doing well. [Long pause]
120:54:29 Communications Technician: Air Boss, Air Boss, Apollo 7. Over. [Long pause]
This is Apollo Control. Donn Eisele apparently spotted the carrier Essex, which is cruising off the southeast coast of Florida. He just put in a call and raised the carrier using the call sign AIR BOSS, and we're getting one half of the ...
120:54:48 Communications Technician: Air Boss, Air Boss. Break, break, break, Air Boss. [Long pause]
120:55:01 Eisele: Hello, Essex. Hello, Essex. This is Apollo 7. Do you read? [Pause]
120:55:08 Eisele: Hello, Air Boss. Air Boss, Apollo 7. [Long pause]
120:55:21 Schirra: Hello Air Boss. Hello, Air Boss. Apollo 7. Do you read?
Long comm break.
Well, with the spacecraft out in the far edge of the Antigua area I'm sure that's the last we'll hear of it until it reaches Ascension and we won't know just how well they received the AIR BOSS - the call sign AIR BOSS, which is the carrier Essex operating about a thousand miles southeast of the coast of Florida. At 120 hours, 56 minutes into the flightthis is Apollo Control
ASCENSION (REV 77)
121:03:44 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Pause]
121:03:48 Cunningham: Roger, Jack.
121:03:51 Swigert: Roger, 7. Walt, we would like to have you switch your O2 tank 1 fans to AUTO.
121:03:52 Schirra (onboard): This ...
121:03:59 Cunningham: A few minutes ago, the [garble] temperature was all the way down to 34 degrees, and steam pressure was about .07 or .08. [Long pause]
121:04:12 Swigert: Roger. We copy that. We would like to find out what cyclic water accumulator you are operating on now. [Long pause]
121:04:23 Eisele: Roger. We're on AUTO 1, and every once in a while, we hear some gurgling sounds. I shouldn't say every once in while, but several times we have heard gurgling sounds in the outlet pipes of the umbilicals. At that time, we generally turn the water accumulator AUTO, OFF and manually cycle the water accumulator three or four times. Seems to have helped. [Long pause]
121:04:45 Swigert: Okay. Copy that. Did you switch auto accumulators lately, Walt? [Long pause]
121:04:56 Cunningham: Unless the last time anybody used the manual water accumulators, maybe then they turned it to OFF and went back to a different one. But I switch it regularly every day in the redunant component check. [Long pause]
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 121 hours, 05 minutes into the flight. Through Ascension, we have been talking to the crew and Wally Schirra cleared up the mystery of that broadcast to the - to AIRBOSS, which is the code name for the primary search and recovery airplane operating off the carrier Essex, that the crew hopes to see in a business way on about next Tuesday morning. Apparently, the recovery people were having a practice run this morning and were using all the call signs. Unbeknownst to them, Apollo 7 was overhead, heard it's name called, and answered the call, so they had a brief chat. Here is the tape from Ascension.
121:05:10 Swigert: Okay. Real fine. We copied some calls down to Air Boss. I think some of the conversations you heard from the ground were that of the recovery forces. They were conducing an exercise In the Atlantic there. [Long pause]
121:05:24 Schirra: Roger. Understand that. We actually got to interrupt their conversations as he switched from Apollo 1 to Apollo 7. [Pause]
121:05:33 Swigert: Roger. I am readt with this landmark tracking PAD whenever you are ready to copy. [Long pause]
121:05:46 Communications Technician: Okay. Surgeon, what do you want? Surgeon? Wait. EECOMM, what did you make of that? [Long pause]
121:06:18 Eisele: Jack, this is Donn. Go ahead with your landmark update.
121:06:20 Swigert: Okay. Landmark ID 10 south, next landmark 67 on track, third one, 141 south. GET, first landmark, 122 plus 14, 122 plus 24, 122 plus 35. [Long pause]
121:07:00 Eisele: Boger. Understand. First landmark is 10 south, number 2 is 67 on track, number 3 is 141 south. The timers are 122 plus 14, 122 plus 124, 122 plus 35. [Long pause]
121:07:19 Swigert: That is correct. [Pause]
121:07:23 Eisele: Roger. We got you. [Long pause]
121:07:34 Swigert: Apollo 7, would you switch your BIOMED to CMP? [Pause]
121:07:43 Eisele: Will do.
121:07:44 Schirra: We changed around so much we lost that one.
121:07:46 Swigert: Copy. [Pause]
121:07:50 Schirra: You mean he has a signature now? [Pause]
121:07:54 Swigert: Affirmative. [Long pause]
121:08:10 Schirra: Hey, Jack.
121:08:11 Swigert: Go ahead.
121:08:12 Schirra: How are our pulse rates doing up here these day? [Pause]
121:08:18 Swigert: Stand by.
121:08:21 Schirra: Okay.
Comm break.
121:09:42 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. The pulse rates for CDR run 60 to 70, for CMP 75 to 90, with 118 during the burn, and LMP has been running around 80. [Long pause]
121:10:02 Schirra: They have gone up during the burn? Very good.
121:10:04 Swigert: Okay. We are just about to lose you over Ascension; Tananarive at 121 plus 19. [Pause]
121:10:12 Schirra: Roger. Jack, ask the medics to save that strip of Sanborn for Donn as the burn starts. It's a nice souvenir for him. [Long pause]
121:10:23 Swigert: Will do, Wally.
121:10:25 Schirra: I still have that one from my [garble] Mercury.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston. Wally Schirra demonstrated an extraordinary interest in medical matters this morning. He asked for the pulse rates of all three crewmen and he suggested that, inasmuch as we had caught Donn Eisele on the chart plugged in, got a pulse rate of 118 at the start of that burn, which he was operating, that the doctors should save the chart indicating the pulse rate and give it to him as a souvenir after the flight. It will be done. At 121 hours, 11 minutes into the flight; this is Apollo Control.
TANANARIVE (REV 77)
121:20:55 Swigert: Apollo 7. Houston through Tananarive. [Pause]
121:21:01 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
121:21:07 Cunningham: Roger. Log LMP 20 clicks of water. [Pause]
121:21:14 Swigert: And, 7, you might be interested that tropical storm Gladys is now officially a hurricane. Its present position is approximately over Havana. You'll be able to see it your next rev. You'll pass almost over it. [Long pause]
121:21:35 Cunningham: Roger. Thanks much.
Comm break.
121:22:53 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7.
121:22:56 Swigert: Go ahead, Apollo 7.
121:22:58 Cunningham: Roger. We're scheduled for a P52 [garble] alignment at this time. I wonder how critical that is. We're not in the proper attitude for it, and since we have to maintain a local vertical for it [garble]. [Long pause]
121:23:21 Swigert: Apollo 7, could you say again? COMM through Tananaritve is pretty poor. [Pause]
121:23:28 Cunningham: Roger. Regarding the P52 alignment at this time: I would prefer not to do that. Over. [Long pause]
121:23:39 Swigert: Okay. Copy. Stand by. [Long pause]
121:23:50 Swigert: Apollo 7, we concur. Negative P52. [Pause]
121:23:55 Cunningham: Roger. Thank you. [Pause]
121:24:01 Swigert: And, 7, we've got about 1 minute LOS Tananarive. We would like to try an S-band contact through ARIA 2 at approximate 121 plus 30. [Long pause]
121:24:15 Cunningham: Okay. We'll do that.
Long comm break.
121:24:16 Eisele (onboard): Wilco. We'll be up.
ARIA 2 (REV 77)
121:30:12 Swigert: ARIA 2, go REMOTE. [Long pause]
121:30:52 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 2. [Long pause]
121:31:32 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA 2. [Pause]
121:31:39 Cunningham: Go ahead, Houston.
121:31:40 Swigert: Roger. Five-by through ARIA 2. [Pause]
121:31:44 Schirra: Very good; best ARIA we've had yet. [Pause]
121:31:50 Swigert: We thought this is about the best COMM we've had through ARIA, Wally. [Pause]
121:31:54 Schirra: Yes, I'm really impressed with it. [Pause]
121:32:03 Swigert: I think maybe we ought to use S-band through all of our ARIA aircraft when we try ARIA. [Pause]
121:32:09 Cunningham: I like - it's better than the work we've had with Tananarive. [Pause]
121:32:13 Swigert: I agree. [Pause]
121:32:21 Schirra: How long can we work this bird, Jack? [Pause]
121:32:25 Swigert: We'll pick up Carnarvon here at 121 plus 33. [Pause]
121:32:30 Schirra: Roger. Do we overlap with ARIA?
121:32:32 Swigert: Affirmative. They will cut us off ARIA at that time, and I have a P27 voice PAD to give you at Carnarvon. [Long pause]
121:32:55 Cunningham: Roger. We'll stand by.
CARNARVON (REV 77)
121:33:01 Cunningham: Just to fill you in, Jack: I'm doing a slow - a very slow roll during the SCS. It's about pitched to about 26 degrees, and we're not getting the torquing effect we had before. [Long pause]
121:33:22 Swigert: Okay. Good news. [Pause]
121:33:28 Schirra: We're getting some more water out of the suits and hoses, and it may be a function of the burns to bring the water up, but obviously, we're, getting it. [Long pause]
121:33:39 Swigert: Okay. Copy it. [Long pause]
This is Apollo Control at 121 hours, 34 minutes into the flight. During this recent swing across the Indian Ocean we had some remarkably clear communication with the spacecraft on the S-band channel via an ARIA aircraft. Remarkably clear - it was clear here on the ground, it was clear in the spacecraft. First let's take the tape from Tananarive, then we'll follow through the aircraft pass. Here it goes.
121:34:34 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
121:34:38 Schirra: Roger. Loud and clear [garble]. [Pause]
121:34:42 Swigert: It's on the subject of water, Wally. Through the TV pass over the States, we diad't copy two - we showed that you were missing two cycles on the water accumulators there. You might have picked up some excess water due to that. [Long pause]
121:35:00 Schirra: I don't think sp. It's a bigger deal than that. We've been cycling off and on extra. It's been cycled whether or not you know every 10 minutes; we can't watch it every 10 minutes. We've been cycling extra passes, and we've done as much as two to three per hour extra. [Long pause]
121:35:19 Swigert: Okay. Copy that. [Pause]
121:35:24 Schirra: It might be worthwhile to have somebody watch it. We are in AUTO at this time. [Pause]
121:35:29 Swigert: Roger. I understand, and ready on that CSM NAV vector whenever you're ready to copy. [Long pause]

121:51:03 Swigert: Standing by.
121:51:04 Cunningham: Thank you.
121:51:05 Eisele: Jack, would you log CMP for ten cliks on the water gun? [Pause]
121:51:09 Swigert: CMP ten clicks.
121:51:11 Eisele: Roger. [Long pause]
121:51:49 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
121:51:52 Cunningham: Go ahead.
121:51:53 Swigert: It appears that your SM AUX TV switch is ON; is that affirmative? [Pause]
121:52:00 Cunningham: Negative. It is OFF. Tape is ON.
121:52:03 Swigert: Roger. I uderstand. [Long pause]
121:52:29 Cunningham: Jack. this is LMP. Give me ten clicks on the water gun; and when you get a chance, can you give us a map update, please? [Pause]
121:52:35 Swigert: Roger. In work.
121:52:38 Swigert: We're just about to lose you over Guam. Hawaii at 121 59; map update then. [Pause]
121:52:44 Cunningham: Thank you.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 121 hours, 53 minutes. Through Guam a minute or so ago we had this communication.
This is Apollo Control at 122 hours even into the flight of Apollo 7. Hawaii is about to acquire. Let's listen.
HAWAII through GRAND BAHAMA ISLAND (REV 77)
122:00:16 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
122:00:19 Schirra: Roger. Loud and clear.
122:00:21 Swigert: Okay. I have your map update.
122:00:23 Schirra: Go.
122:00:25 Swigert: For REV 77, the node 121 plus 49 plus 18. longitude at 148.8 degrees east, right ascension of 04 plus 28. [Long pause]
122:00:47 Cunningham: Roger. Jack, we haven't been using any of the right aseension so you can drop those unless we ask for one, if you will. [Pause]
122:00:53 Swigert: Okay.
122:00:55 Eisele: Jack. this is CMP.
122:00:57 Swigert: Go ahead.
122:00:59 Eisele: Roger. How many of these landmarks do you have real-time coverage for? [Pause]
122:01:04 Swigert: Stand by. [Long pause]
122:01:47 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We are covering the first two landmarks real time. [Pause]
122:01:54 Eisele: Okay. [Long pause]
122:02:19 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
122:02:22 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
122:02:23 Schirra: Roger. We've been up here trying to deliberate whether to look at the hurricane or the second landmark. I suspect the second lanamark is socked in by the hurricane, is it not? [Pause]
122:02:32 Swigert: Negative.
122:02:34 Schirra: Okay.
Long comm break.
122:10:02 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
122:10:06 Schirra: Go ahead.
122:10:07 Swigert: Boger. I have this midcourse navigation PAD to pass up whenever you are ready to copy. [Long pause]
122:10:18 Cunningham: We will do it later. Pretty well tied up with this now.
122:10:21 Swigert: Okay. No problem. I'm just standing by. [Long pause]
122:10:36 Cunningham: Go ahead, Jack. I'll copy it.
122:10:39 Swigert: Okay. GET start 123 plus 52, 124 plus 04, star 37, star 45, roll 000 001, pitch 356 306, yaw 001 001, shaft 019 355, trunnion 018 014, end.
Comm break.
122:12:01 Cunningham: Apollo 7. Do you read?
122:12:03 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Read yon now. Did you copy the midcours navigation PAD? [Pause]
122:12:12 Cunningham: 124 plus 04, stars 37 and 45, 000 001, 356 306, 001 001, 019 355, 018 014. Over. [Long pause]
122:12:32 Swigert: Roger. I didn't get your readback of the first tile. That should he 123 plus 52. [Long pause]
122:13:02 Swigert: Apo]lo 7, HoustOn. Did you copy that? [Pause]
122:13:06 Cunningham: I didn't copy anything after I gave you the readback.
122:13:08 Swigert: Okay. Walt, I didn't get the readback on the first time. The first GET was 123 plus 52. [Pause]
122:13:18 Cunningham: Concur.
122:13:19 Swigert: Okay. Real fine. [Long pause]
122:13:48 Cunningham: Jack, mark the LMP ten clicks of water. [Pause]
122:13:52 Swigert: Copy that.
Comm break.
122:14:57 Eisele: Hey. Jack, this is Donn.
122:14:59 Swigert: Go ahead.
122:15:00 Eisele: That first landmark you gave me wasn't even within the field of view of the optics at zero roll angle. [Pause]
122:15:06 Swigert: Roger. Copy that. [Long pause]
122:15:46 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
Comm break.
122:16:56 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
122:17:15 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
122:17:18 Cunningham: Go, Jack.
122:17:19 Swigert: Okay. Donn, on this second landmark, we can give you a shaft and trunion to help you out here. Shaft will be 008, and your trunion will be 031. This will occur when you're pitched down 10 degrees and in ORB RATE. [Long pause]
122:17:39 Eisele: Roger. Understand. Thank you. Jack, I'm going to try to get the optics. It turns out that my field of view in the telescope is only 38 degrees anyway, so I might as well go ahead and use the optics. [Long pause]
122:17:51 Swigert: Okay. Real fine.
122:17:52 Eisele: What faked me out that last time: I wasn't aware that I needed to roll the spacecraft. I was looking for it to the south, but it was so far south that it was out of view . [Pause]
122:18:02 Swigert: Okay. Copy that. [Long pause]
122:18:49 Schirra: Got some nice weather down there now, Jack? [Pause]
122:18:55 Swigert: Weather was pretty good when I came in, Wally.
122:18:58 Schirra: Yes, it looks good from here. [Long pause]
122:19:19 Schirra: There's just a solid overcast for a hurricane. [Pause]
122:19:23 Swigert: Roger.
122:19:24 Schirra: There's a little bit of vortex way out here. I'll take one shot as we're going into it. [Pause]
122:19:30 Swigert: Roger. It's moving north toward Florida. [Long pause]
122:19:44 Schirra: Frame 89 - frame 88 was approaching Houston; frame 89 is approaching the hurricane just now. [Pause]

HAWAII through GRAND BAHAMA ISLAND (REV 78)
122:20:36 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7.
122:20:38 Swigert: Go ahead.
122:20:40 Eisele: Roger. Could you give us the shaft and trunnion for the third landmark as well? [Pause]
122:20:44 Swigert: Will do. Shaft 040, trunnion 031. [Pause]
122:20:53 Eisele: Roger.
122:20:54 Schirra: There's some high cirrus way high in the forms of vertex sweeping from our left to our right and then coming back around to the north - which, of course, is the characteristic pattern - and some low solid stuff; you can almost see the eye in the center of it. I'm trying to get a picture of that now. [Long pause]
122:21:11 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
122:21:15 Schirra: It's definitely a circular pattern here. We'll be going over the eye in about another - oh, I'd say, 4 or 5 seconds. [Pause]
122:21:23 Swigert: Copy.
122:21:24 Schirra: I'll try to give you a pretty good eye location. Stand by. [Pause]
122:21:31 Schirra: Mark.
122:21:32 Schirra: That's the eye. [Pause]
122:21:38 Schirra: That's a real tight report on your hurricane.
122:21:41 Swigert: Roger, Wally. [Long pause]
122:22:11 Schirra: Good weather from here.
Comm break.
122:23:48 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
122:23:50 Schirra: Go ahead, Jack.
122:23:52 Swigert: Roger. We got the - at the time you read out the mark, we got a latitude and longitude, and we have passed it on to the Hurricane Center. [Pause]
122:24:01 Schirra: Roger. That's a new first on mark of hurricanes.
122:24:04 Swigert: Roger.
122:24:07 Schirra: Fair weather. [Long pause]
122:24:22 Schirra: Jack, tell the Center to send it away from that boat basin. [Pause]
122:24:26 Swigert: Boger. Will do, Wally.
122:24:29 Schirra: Tell them to get it out of the way next Tuesday. [Pause]
122:24:33 Swigert: We'll do that, too.
122:24:36 Schirra: Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, 122 hours, 29 minutes. In the course of that pass, you heard Wally Schirra marking the hurricane Gladys with great accuracy. He went right over the eye of the hurricane and seemed to take a little understandable pride in this Manned Weather Satellite function, which the crew assumed riding right over the top of a hurricane. We'll be back with an Ascension acquisition in about 3 minutes.
Apollo Control, Houston. We should have Apollo 7 by Ascension any moment. Let's listen.
ASCENSION (REV 78)
122:39:12 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension. [Pause]
122:39:16 Schirra: Roger.
122:39:17 Swigert: Roger. It appears that the evaporator is dried out again.
Comm break.
122:40:30 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
122:40:32 Swigert: Go ahead.
122:40:34 Schirra: Are we going to have a tape when we lose you here? [Pause]
122:40:38 Swigert: That's affirmative, Wally. How did the last two landmark points come out? [Pause]
122:40:45 Eisele: Terrible.
122:40:47 Swigert: Roger. Copy. [Pause]
122:40:51 Cunningham: Roger. On the second one, I relied on all optics to bring it in when it got within 38 degress, and the thing never moved off center; so at that point, I attempted to go for it manually, and by the time I got over to it - I recougnized it, and it was going so fast that high speed resolve wouldn't catch it. It got away from me. I finally picked it up just as it went outside the field of view, but it was too late to get any marks. On the third one, I loaded in the date of the landmarks up here, and when I went down on [AUTO] optics, it indicated that the target was completely outside the field of view to the north. After awhile, I saw the thing a little bit to the south of us, I think, with, relative [garble]. And Wally and Walt actually saw the thing a little bit to the south of us, but should have been within the field of view. So what it amounts to, is I got faked out three times on this stupid old AUTO OPTICS in here. [Long pause]
122:41:40 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
122:41:43 Cunningham: Now, the next time we do, I'm going to stick to the NORMAL mode, as we originally planned, and see if that works out a little better. [Pause]
122:41:50 Swigert: Okay.
Comm break.
122:43:00 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Ascension; Tananarive at 122 plus 54. [Pause]

123:11:15 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon.
123:11:18 Schirra: Roger. Loud and clear.
123:11:20 Swigert: You are loud and clear.
123:11:22 Cunningham: We're starting [garble] pitch down. [Pause]
123:11:28 Schirra: Do you want me to put [garble] ball number 1? [Pause]
123:11:37 Swigert: Stand by. [Pause]
123:11:42 Cunningham: Roger. We're not near our perigee by any means. [Pause]
123:11:49 Cunningham: We're about 40 minutes away from perigee.
123:11:52 Swigert: Affirmative. [Long pause]
123:12:05 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Affirmative. We'd like GDC an ball 1. [Pause]
123:12:10 Cunningham: Roger. You've got it. [Pause]
123:12:14 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
123:12:18 Schirra: Do you have all bands or GDC? [Pause]
123:12:26 Swigert: GDC.
123:12:27 Schirra (onboard): You've got.
123:12:28 Schirra: GDC.
123:12:31 Cunningham: Jack, this is Walt. I've got a comment on this food you might pass on to Frank and those guys. This high-calorie stuff that's got everything hiked up with calories is just getting to us something fierce. In order to get a lot of calories in a small weight, everything has been hiked up, and it's all got a sweet taste. Something you think tasted real good to you, but by the time you get to the end of the bag you can't really look it in the eye very well. [Long pause]
123:12:59 Swigert: Roger. I understand that.
123:13:01 Schirra: The crux to this thing was to save stowed weight, and as a result, the food was raised in caloric count, and it's all sweet stuff. [Long pause]
123:13:16 Swigert: Roger.
123:13:18 Cunningham: You also might pass on to that crew, Jack, in case they haven't selected their menu yet. I had a tendency to pick out a menu which had individual items that I liked a lot out of the samples. If I had it to do over again, I would try to make sure I had a wider variety of acceptable foods. [Long pause]
123:13:38 Swigert: Okay. Copy that, Walt. We are about 30 seconds LOS Carnarvon; Guam at 123 plus 19. [Pause]
123:13:46 Schirra: Do you want to leave this on GDC ball 1? [Pause]
123:13:50 Swigert: Affirmative. We'll pick it up at Guam.
123:13:53 Schirra: Okay.
123:13:56 Swigert: Wally, is it about the same torque that you've observed previously? [Pause]
123:14:00 Schirra: No, we're not near perigee at this tame. We want to see if we can get some data, then we'll go back and realign the GDC. [Pause]
123:14:07 Swigert: Roger.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston 123 hours, 15 minutes into the flight. A few minutes ago over Carnarvon we heard some interesting observations on meal planning, and on the taste of the meals, the caloric comments, and some very pungent comments from Walt Cunningham. Let's listen.
This is Apollo Control, Houston 123 hours, 20 minutes. We should be acquiring via Guam just any second.
The Guam data has just flashed on our screens. The television displays here, I notice the cabin out there is running 69 degrees today.
GUAM (REV 78)
123:21:42 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Guam.
123:21:43 Cunningham: Roger [garble]. [Pause]
123:21:48 Swigert: Roger. Walt, I would like to have you turn your S-band AUX tape switch OFF. [Pause]
123:21:58 Cunningham: OFF.
123:22:00 Swigert: Roger. Wally, we've noticed that the tailoff value that is presently loaded into the ... [Pause]
123:22:08 Cunningham: What was the answer, Jack, to your obtaining our TV switch ON awhile back when it was OFF? Did you find out about that? [Long pause]
123:22:19 Swigert: Roger. Walt, it was the tape switch that we observed on telemetry on the ground, and we thought it was the TV switch. [Pause]
123:22:27 Cunningham: Okay. Understand. And is our transponder secondary completely blotched? [Long pause]
123:22:38 Swigert: Stand by. [Pause]
123:22:45 Swigert: Apollo 7. On the secondary transponder, that's not definite yet, but we don't want to reselect it at this time. [Pause]
123:22:55 Cunningham: Understand.
123:22:57 Swigert: Okay. And something else that we would like to discuss here: the tailoff value that is presently loaded in the computer for the CMC is not large enough for what we have observed on your burns. We would like to load a new value into the computer with the following procedure. Are you react to copy? [Long pause]
123:23:22 Eisele: Wait one. [Long pause]
123:24:04 Eisele: Roger. Jack, go ahead with your procedure.
123:24:07 Swigert: Okay. VERB 21, NOUN 01, ENTER; 3003 ENTER; 74 ENTER. That's it. [Long pause]
123:24:29 Eisele: Roger. Is that it?
123:24:30 Swigert: That's it.
123:24:33 Eisele: Okay [garble]. [Pause]
123:24:42 Swigert: Could you say again, Donn? You cut out there just as you gave it. [Pause]
123:24:46 Eisele: Roger. VERB 21, NOUN 01, 3003, then 74. [Pause]
123:24:52 Swigert: Roger. That is correct.
123:24:54 Schirra: Jack, that sounds like an SOP for that power technique. [Pause]
123:25:04 Swigert: Say again, 7. [Pause]
123:25:11 Schirra: Okay. No strain.
123:25:13 Swigert: Roger.
123:25:15 Eisele: Jack, this is CMP.
123:25:17 Swigert: Go ahead, Donn.
123:25:19 Eisele: On these landmarks tomorrow: I see we've got three passes scheduled, don't we? [Pause]
123:25:26 Swigert: Affirmative.
123:25:28 Eisele: Okay. I would like to suggest that we devote one pass - or at least part of a pass - to doing some unknown landmark tracking, because I found that up here in flight that it is fairly easy to track any given object on the ground once you see it. The trouble with these known landmarks is that they are damn hard to bring in in the first place, because either the AUTO optics dosn't work or they are outside the field of view sometimes. I have found that you can track with the sextant fairly easily. So how about running that around with the G&N people, and see if they are agre_le. We don't have anything in the flight plan at all about checking unknown landmark performance. [Long pause]
123:26:10 Swigert: Roger. Copy that. We will toss it around here and let yen know. [Long pause]
123:26:36 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
123:26:37 Cunningham: Go ahead, Jack.
123:26:38 Swigert: Roger. We would like to zero some attitude errors by taking the BMAG switches and going to rate 2 momentarily and then back to add 1, rate 2. [Long pause]
123:26:51 Schirra: We are not getting much torquing this time, so there is not much sense spending - spending input on this particular area. [Pause]
123:26:59 Swigert: Roger. We just thoughbt we would watch it as you went through perigee. [Pause]
123:27:03 Schirra: Yes. I think what we will do is try to give it to you on the rest of this pass where we are tracking because we are going to go back through it agntn. [Pause]
123:27:09 Swigert: Roger.
123:27:10 Schirra: But we are going to face up to perigee.
123:27:13 Swigert: Roger. Copy that. You've got 1 minute LOS Guam; Hawaii at 123 plus 34.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, 123 hours, 55 minutes. Through Hawaii, we're having this conversation.
HAWAII (REV 78)
123:35:06 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
123:35:09 Schirra: Aloha.
123:35:11 Swigert: Roger. We would like to - if you're not busy with the computer, we would like to send you an update. [Long pause]
123:35:22 Schirra: Go ahead. Wait; hold it a second. You have got it. [Pause]
123:35:27 Swigert: Okay. Coming up. I'm ready with a NAV check when you are ready to copy. [Long pause]
123:35:44 Schirra: Go ahead.
123:35:45 Swigert: Roger. 128 30 0000 minus 0266 minus 12940 0999. [Long pause]
123:36:09 Eisele: Roger. 128 30 0000 minus 0266 minus 12940 0999. [Pause]
123:36:18 Swigert: Roger. And on that procedure that we gave you for loading a different DELTA-V tailoff in the computer: after you get that done, we'd like you to read it out, Donn, and check it, and if you need the procedure to do that, I have it. [Long pause]
123:36:39 Eisele: Roger. Jack, that's just a standard erasable update. I'll do it when you get done uplinking. [Pause]
123:36:44 Swigert: Okay. There's no hurry on it. [Pause]
123:36:49 Unidentifiable crewmember: Jack, I would like to make a comnent or two regarding this star horizon business. [Pause]
123:36:55 Swigert: Okay. Go ahead.
123:36:57 Unidentifiable crewmember: Well, I've examined the horizon in the telescope and sextant under all different light conditions varing from total darkness to broad daylight with the sun overhead, and I can find no reliable line or band or anything in there that's repeatable at all distant sun angles. Furthermore, I know that stars in general are not visible during the daytime. About the only way you can see it is to get AUTO of the optics to pull one into the sextant for you. Obviously, if you're doing P23, you can't use AUTO optics to pull the star in there, so the chances of this thing ever working out are pretty slim, I guess. [Long pause]
123:37:34 Swigert: Roger. Copy that.
123:37:36 Eisele: Roger. I suggest that we try one run of this just to prove that it won't work and then regroup and plan to do some star-to-lunar landmark business later on in the flight somewhere. [Long pause]
123:37:49 Swigert: Roger. We copy that. [Long pause]
123:38:07 Schirra: It's kind of insulting to realize that the same light bands and horizons are there that we reported back in Mercury days. [Pause]
123:38:17 Swigert: Roger.

123:39:20 Schirra: Jack, you done with your update?
123:39:21 Swigert: Affirmative, 7. Computer is yours. [Long pause]
123:39:44 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
123:39:47 Schirra: Go ahead.
123:39:49 Swigert: Donn, on this star horizon sighting here: if you're at the roll, pitch, and yaw attitudes that we gave you and have the trunion and shaft values that we gave you also set in, the horizon should be visible in the landmark line of sight and the star visible in the star line of sight. [Long pause]
123:40:11 Eisele (onboard): Well, I know it should be, but I'm just telling you I don't think there's going to be enough accuracy in the actual - well, you know. What are you going to use for the horizon? It's about 2 degrees wide out there.
123:40:12 Eisele: [Garble]. [Pause]
123:40:18 Swigert: And, Apollo 7, as we lose you here over Hawaii, we're going to try ARIA on S-band. Do you want to turn up your S-band volume up? I think we may have better COMM with ARIA than Huntsville.
Comm break.
123:40:26 Eisele (onboard): The horizon's probably been 2 degrees wide since Earth was created, but only two people know about it.

123:46:04 Eisele: Roger. Do you read? [Pause]
123:46:11 Eisele: [Garble]. [Pause]
123:46:17 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
123:46:18 Eisele: Loud and clear.
123:46:20 Swigert: You're loud sad clear. Donn, we had an LOS there, Hawaii. Did you - were yon able to copy my remarks on the star horizon check? [Pause]
123:46:29 Eisele: Roger, Jack.
123:46:30 Swigert: Okay.
123:46:32 Schirra: We heard you.
123:46:33 Swigert: Real fine. [Long pause]
123:47:01 Swigert: Wally, we lost - LOS Hawaii. Were you - did you get my comments to turn up S-band? We were trying to get ARIA 3 on S-band. [Pause]
123:47:11 Schirra: Negative. We missed that. I did hear you just before this last call. You tried to talk to Donn again, and it came up on S-hand. We didn't hear it. [Pause]
123:47:20 Swigert: Okay. ARIA works so good down there in Australia on S-band that we were going to try and use ARIA instead of Huntsville to get a little better COMM. [Pause]
123:47:30 Schirra: Roger. We'll try that a couple more times.
123:47:33 Swigert: Okay. Real fine.
123:47:35 Schirra: What's the next time? [Pause]
123:47:39 Swigert: We will have ARTA 3 the next pass over - in between - about the same place. [Pause]
123:47:49 Schirra: I agree. [Long pause]
123:48:00 Schirra: We got ARIA 3 in the flight plan. Roger. [Long pause]
123:48:45 Schirra: Hey, Jack, we are approaching perigee, and I'm going to give you GDC on ball number 1. [Pause]
123:48:52 Swigert: Roger. Copy. [Pause]
123:48:57 Schirra: We're not pitched up too much local vertical; it's about 33 - 34 degrees. [Pause]
123:49:02 Swigert: Okay.
123:49:04 Schirra: This is a long pass; they might be able to check this thing. [Pause]
123:49:10 Schirra: You've got local vertical on DSKY and GDC on number 1. [Pause]
123:49:14 Swigert: Copy that. [Pause]
123:49:21 Schirra: And you can make note of the pitch thruster working. [Pause]

At 123 hours and 55 minutes we have a loss of contact with the spacecraft over Honduras, and I would say in Central America. Of increasing interest as we near the midpoint of the mission is the retro fire clock. All the while it has been counting and it now reads 135 hours, 45 minutes to retrofire. Almost as large a number as our elapsed clock at 123 hours, 56 minutes. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 124 hours, 27 minutes into the mission. We are on the 78th revolution around the Earth and we are about to tag up with Apollo 7 via Tananarive. Our orbital elements are thusly: perigee 90.2 miles, apogee 157.3. The orbital period is 89 minutes, 04 seconds.

124:28:40 Swigert: Donn, we would like to wait until Guam to get your comments on the P23 - on the results of P23. [Pause]
124:28:50 Eisele: Okay. How soon is that?
124:28:53 Swigert: Guam acquisition is 124 plus 54, unless you are going to be asleep then. [Pause]
124:29:00 Eisele: I'm supposed to be; that takes almost an hour out of it, Jack. [Pause]
124:29:05 Eisele: Were [garble] change over. [Pause]
124:29:13 Swigert: Okay. Why don't you give them to us now, then? We don't want to interfere with your sleep cycle. [Pause]
124:29:18 Eisele: What we'll do is get a little tape and d_mp it. [Pause]
124:29:23 Swigert: Okay. That is fine.
124:29:25 Schirra: Okay. There's nothing critical [garble] too long. It will be a lot better on tape [garble] I guess we could call it that. [Long pause]
124:29:41 Swigert: Okay. Wally, we are having a hard time reading you here at Tananarive. Perhaps you could put your comments on the torquing as you went through perigee on the DSE tape, also, and we will dump that, too. [Long pause]
124:29:57 Schirra: We'll put that on tape, and [garble] over Guam. I'd like to have Donn turn in by then. [Pause]
124:30:06 Swigert: I couldn't pick that up. We will dump that at the next possible time. [Pause]

124:34:40 Swigert: It was a good shift today; a good show.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control 124 hours, 53 minutes and we're in touch with Apollo 7 at the Mercury now. Here is how it sounds.
MERCURY (REV 79)
124:52:26 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury.
124:52:29 Schirra: Good evening, Ron.
124:52:31 Evans: Good evening.
124:52:33 Schirra: I was talking to Jack about this perigee torque problem - I think that's probably a good name for it - and we'd gone across the - well, I'll tell you about the west coast going down over Mexico south, actually over the Panama Canal Zone on the last pass. [Long pause]
124:52:53 Evans: Roger.
124:52:54 Schirra: We're set up for a star horizon check, locked up pretty tight on 356 degrees inertial, which as we came across the coast went to SCS zero degrees pitch. The deadband was real tight; this was in the SCS attitude hold band and MIN deadband lower range limit cycle ON. As soon as the test was terminated, I turned all SCS channels off to conserve fuel, and then I had no pitch rate, no roll rate, no yaw rates on the needles. Then about - I'd say 10 minutes, we went to perigee; it was actually to 121 hours and 51 minutes, I think it was - 123 hours, 51 minutes. We start pitchinig up to about three-tenths of a degree per second as we aproach perigee, and then it would start pitching down, and actually went back down to zero again in rate.
Comm break.
124:54:03 Schirra: And when we actually went to drifting flight, the pitch was about 35 degrees up, pitch up local vertical; it went down to about minus 40 degrees or 310 to 320 degrees local vertical. That's where the rate stopped, and then it started back up slightly during the pitch. Torque was just in pitch in that case. [Long pause]
124:54:28 Evans: Roger. We copy. [Pause]
124:54:33 Schirra: That's a new one that I've never heard of before. We suspected something like that with the S-IVB and even with the Agena, but this really showed it to us. [Long pause]
124:54:45 Evans: Roger. Sure did. [Pause]
124:54:51 Schirra: Another interesting thing we saw as we went down through South America: we'd seen the hurricane earlier today, went right over it, in fact. You could see the eye of it as a little depressed dimple in the center of the hurricane. [Long pause]
124:55:04 Evans: Roger.
124:55:06 Schirra: All the dense thunderheads as we went over South America had flat tops and rather large ones, and they had little depressions in the center just like the hurricane, and had the reversed flow pattern on the flat tops, which you would expect in the southern latitudes - the reverse coriolis effect. [Long pause]
124:55:27 Evans: That's interesting.
124:55:29 Schirra: I'd never heard of that effect before, you know, on the top of a thunderstorm. [Pause]
124:55:35 Evans: I hadn't either. [Pause]
124:55:40 Schirra: All of Donn's experments bombed. [Pause]
124:55:45 Evans: Roger.
124:55:46 Schirra: The horizon isn't as good as everybody says it is, although those of us who have flown said it's exactly the way it is right now. [Pause]
124:55:53 Schirra: I'm sorry to define the star-to-horizon check didn't work. The landmark optical tracking didn't work. We tried to use AUTO optics, and they did not bring it in. Tomorrow we're going to [garble]. [Long pause]
GUAM (REV 79)
124:56:19 Schirra: What do you have for us? [Pause]
124:56:26 Evans: I missed you - in the handover there, your star horizon didn't work, and everything after that, Wally. [Long pause]
124:56:38 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
124:56:41 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Go.
124:56:43 Schirra: Boger. Did you get the last?
124:56:44 Evans: Negative. I missed everything, after Donn's horizon not got and the star horizon didn't work. [Pause]
124:56:51 Schirra: That's correct. And the program 23 didn't work, and it wasn't designed to work on the Earth orbit and particularly on the SUNDISK. We lost that fight on the ground, but I think we won it up here. [Long pause]
124:57:05 Evans: Roger.
124:57:07 Schirra: There's always a question of using up fuel on it. We're going to try tomorrow, unknown landmarks. Known landmarks did not work; the AUTO optics did not bring them in, and they're hard to find, particularly in the earth-orbit position. [Long pause]
124:57:30 Evans: Roger. We're working up the chart now for you for tomorrow.
124:57:33 Schirra: Very good. How was the day back in Houston? [Pause]
124:57:39 Evans: It was a nice day here.
124:57:41 Schirra: Very good. Looked good to us. [Pause]
124:57:45 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
124:57:47 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause]

124:59:14 Cunningham: Hey, Ron. You got time to give us a chart update?
124:59:17 Evans: Roger. Stand by. And, Walt, BIOMED to your position. [Pause]
124:59:25 Cunningham: Got it. [Pause]
124:59:30 Cunningham: You guys better watch the waterboiler pretty close. We had it going dry on us numerous times for several days, and it seems to happen over a period of about 4 seconds [garble]. [Long pause]
124:59:49 Evans: Roger. You say it seems to happen over a period of 4 seconds? [Pause]
124:59:54 Cunningham: Oh, about 30 seconds time if you go from operating normally to tank low on the steam pressure, it seems like. [Pause]
125:00:04 Evans: Roger. We'll keep a close eye on it then. [Long pause]
125:00:48 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. About 30 seconds LOS; Hawaii at 09. Leave your map update and block data at that time. [Pause]
125:00:57 Cunningham: Roger. And we won't need the right ascension, Ron. We really don't make any use of it, so unless we ask for it, why don't we just skip those right ascensions? [Pause]
125:01:07 Evans: Oh, Roger. I concur.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. 125 hours, 1 minute. Guam has LOS. During the passes at the Mercury and Guam, Wally Schirra discussed the - what he termed perigee torque. That's the pitch moments that the spacecraft seems to get at perigee. In the discussion of that, he described some of the weather near the hurricane. He reported the star horizon sightings didn't work, and indicated that the crew would spend a little time this evening planning tomorrow's TV show. The next station to acquire Apollo 7 will be Hawaii. At 125 hours, 9 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.

125:22:47 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause]
125:22:58 Schirra: Did you catch our TV pass today?
125:23:00 Evans: Affirmative. It was a good one again. The quality wasn't quite as good as it was the other days. I've got some dope on that ALC switch. I'll try to pass up to you sometime this evening. [Long pause]

126:05:06 Cunningham: Roger, Ron. Reading you five-by. How me?
126:05:09 Evans: Roger. Not too bad this time, Walt. Have a little question on the chlorination. Have you chlorinated yet? [Pause]
126:05:16 Cunningham: No, and it's not our intention to chlorinate today. We chlorinated yesterday. You don't have any objections to chlorinating every other day, have you? [Long pause]
126:05:28 Evans: Roger. I understand you're intent on the thing. Do you still have a bad taste in it? Is this the reason? [Pause]
126:05:37 Cunningham: We're just now starting to feel well enough about cold, and the water has tasted palatable enough, so we feel like - like cutting down the cold by drinking as much fluid as we can. But if we chlorinate, the taste of it afterward would be very bad for several hours, and it's not really good until the next day. [Long pause]
126:06:01 Evans: Okay. We understand and do not chlorinate today. We'll pass it today and chlorinate tomorrow. [Pause]
126:06:11 Cunningham: Okay. Very good. I think that's a pretty sensible schedule. We'll catch the chlorination tomorrow. Got two questions for you, Ron, if you're ready to copy. [Long pause]
126:06:22 Evans: Say again.
126:06:24 Cunningham: One, what is the precise inclination of our orbit? And second, we'd like to get a chart update for our RCS chart onboard. [Long pause]
126:06:38 Evans: Roger. What is the precise inclination of your orbit? Is that what you said? [Pause]
126:06:43 Cunningham: Right. And Wally would like to hear the proposed fix on the BIOMED sensors because he's getting shoot it up again. [Pause]
126:06:52 Evans: Roger. We'll get your information on the BIOMED sensors. Walt, your inclination is 31.25. [Long pause]
126:07:10 Cunningham: Roger.
126:07:11 Evans: And on your BIOMED sensors, what we want to use - or use the two good ones in the middle of your chest, and those two good ones will have to be connected to the blue signal conditioner, which means you're going to have to switch to wires that go into the signal conditioners. [Long pause]
126:07:34 Cunningham: Okay. You want the two sternal leads to go to the blue signal conditioner, right? [Pause]
126:07:42 Evans: Yes, that's affirmative.
126:07:45 Cunningham: Okay. That means Wally will have to connect the connector of the other signal conditioner and use that lead to the sternal. [Pause]
126:07:52 Evans: That's affirmative. That's affirmative.
Comm break.
126:08:56 Cunningham: Okay. He'll try. If that doesn't work, we will just have to write if off, because he has been trying to piece that thing together for the last 126 hours. He'll try it. [Long pause]

126:27:29 Schirra: Quad A. I thought quad C was the first one we were going to be switching. [Long pause]
126:27:40 Evans: Roger. Stand by, Walt.
126:27:43 Cunningham: And, Ron, I was given some numbers today that what the onboard meters should read when we switch to secondaries. Is that going to be open loop; and when I get down to that reading, I should switch; or will you be giving me later dope on switching? [Long pause]
126:27:59 Evans: We're keeping track of it, Walt, and will probably be giving you later dope on it, but those are the figures that we have at this time. [Pause]
126:28:08 Cunningham: Roger. And I was told that C was the closest to getting on the secondaries. [Pause]
126:28:13 Evans: That is affirmative. As far as your onboard reading is concerned, it's 54 percent for C, 49 for D Delta, and A is 46 percent. [Long pause]
126:28:28 Cunningham: Roger. [Long pause]
126:28:51 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Request you cycle O2 tank two fan ON for 5 minutes and then OFF. [Long pause]
126:29:05 Cunningham: Roger, Ron.
126:29:08 Evans: And when you get a chance, yon can read out your service module RCS propeller quantities and your system test meter 5 A through D and 6 A through D. [Long pause]
126:29:23 Cunningham: Roger. And I'll give you the quantities right now before I forget it. Can you have them standing by when we are coming over Hawaii to check Wally's BIOMED readouts? [Pause]
126:29:33 Evans: Wilco.
126:29:36 Cunningham: Okay. A through D: reading 51, blank 55 plus and 58. Over. [Long pause]
126:29:58 Evans: Roger. Copy.
126:30:01 Cunningham: Say again the number for my chart? [Pause]
126:30:05 Evans: Roger. The total for your chart is 688. [Pause]
126:30:11 Cunningham: Roger. 688. I will give you the test meter readouts.
126:30:13 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
126:30:33 Cunningham: Okay. For 5 C is 5 volts. Five D is 5 volts, 6 Dog 5, 6 Charlie 4.8, 6 Baker 5, 6 Able 5. Over. [Long pause]
126:30:55 Evans: Roger. You have 5 Alpha? [Pause]
126:31:03 Cunningham: Okay. Five Alpha is 1.7. [Pause]
126:31:10 Evans: Say again.
126:31:11 Cunningham: Which should be on the order about 70 - degrees Farenheit, I believe. [Pause]
126:31:17 Evans: Roger. Mas that 1.7? [Pause]
126:31:21 Cunningham: That is affirmative. 1.7.
126:31:24 Evans: Roger. And I have your ground compute usable RCS propellant remaining if you would like those. [Long pause]
126:31:40 Cunningham: Okay. Go with them.
126:31:42 Evans: Roger. It will be 46 percent, 50 percent, 45 percent, and 52 percent - A through D. [Long pause]
126:31:56 Cunningham: Forty-six, 50, 45, 52?
126:31:59 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
126:32:04 Cunningham: How did you ever get Baker to be 50 end Dog to be 52? [Pause]
126:32:11 Evans: I am not quite sure, but it works out that way. [Long pause]
126:32:34 Cunningham (onboard): You still there, Ron?
126:32:35 Cunningham: [Garble].
126:32:38 Evans: LOS. I think I missed you.

This is Apollo Control 126 hours, 32 minutes into the mission. Mercury has LOS. During this pass we updated the spacecraft with ground computed reaction control system propellant quantities and we got a readout from the onboard RCS quantities. This is the sleep period for the command module pilot, Donn Eisele. Hawaii will acquire at 126 hours, 43 minutes. This is Mission Control Houston.

126:46:04 Evans: Roger. Looks like you're getting the AUXILIARY, the ones under your arms there going into the blue signal conditioner which is okay. We can do - we can do with that one. [Long pause]
126:46:18 Schirra: That's what you asked for, isn't it? [Pause]
126:46:22 Evans: Not quite, but that's okay. With what we're trying ...
126:46:25 Schirra: I thought you wanted the two sternals to go into the black and the two AUXILIARY into the blue. [Long pause]
126:46:37 Evans: No, we thought the broken wire was from the two sternal ones going into the blue ... [Pause]
126:46:46 Schirra: I think the low sternal is broken. [Pause]
126:46:52 Evans: Okay, Okay. I see what you're saying. The lower sternal is broken, but what we're trying to do - was get the two sternal ones to go into the blue signal conditioner. [Pause]
126:47:02 Schirra: That's how they were originally.
126:47:05 Evans: Yes, right. But we wanted to switch the pieces of wire that go into the signal conditioner, the AUXILIARY wires that go into the signal conditioner - into the black signal conditioner. We wanted to use that lower piece of the wire and hook that piece of the wire to the center sensors. [Long pause]
126:47:36 Schirra: I won't have you change my spark plugs.
126:47:38 Evans: (Laughter) Okay. It's working okay the way it is. It's fine. [Pause]
126:47:46 Schirra: Okay. [Pause]
126:47:53 Evans: The good doctors say, "Thank you." [Pause]

126:47:58 Cunningham: You know Wally, anything for the doctor.
126:48:01 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
126:48:09 Cunningham: Say, I've kind of lost track. Is this day 8 or day 9? [Pause]
126:48:15 Evans: I have to - wait one. [Long pause]
126:48:28 Evans: I got a time hack to end of mission, if you'd like that. [Pause]
126:48:37 Schirra: I was trying to figure out how to get a big clock to count down.
126:48:40 Evans: (Laughter). [Pause]

127:38:28 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. I can't make too much out of that, other than there was a large puddle of water by the water fitting on the waste water disconnect. [Long pause]
127:38:39 Schirra: Roger. That's affirmative. And you might look into putting a different type fitting back into the water control panel to solve the problem of water leaking there every time I dump. [Long pause]

CapCom Ron Evans passed up the battery status to the crew, gave them the amount of ampere-hours remaining in their batteries. Walt Cunningham gave a report on the continuing water problem inside the cabin. Much of it was unreadable, but we did copy it that there is a puddle of water by the fitting of the waste water disconnect. Walt also reported getting several good pictures of the West Coast of Chile. The tracking ship Mercury will acquire Apollo 7 next. That will be at 127 hours, 59 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.

MERCURY (REV 82)
129:34:50 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. [Pause]
129:34:55 Cunningham: Roger, Houston.
129:34:57 Evans: Roger. Loud and clear.
129:35:00 Cunningham: Want to make a readout of our manifold pressure? [Pause]
129:35:04 Evans: Roger. Stand by. We have no data yet. [Long pause]
129:35:45 Evans: 7, Houston. Looks like we've got a processing problem here for a little bit. I've got the results of what we feel on the evaporator, if you would like to hear it. [Long pause]
129:35:57 Cunningham: Roger. I'd be very interested.
129:36:00 Evans: Roger. When we're operating under low cyclic loads - cyclic heat loads, as we have been doing, the evaporator will dry itself out. This is basically caused by the evaporator boiling more water under low heat loads than is being supplied to it. The end result is drying of the evaporator. If the evaporator is left in AUTO, the back pressure valve remains open and completely evacuates the evaporator. When the water valve is now opened either automatically or mannually, the first water that goes into the evaporator flash freezes. This stops any more water from getting into the evaporator until it thaws out. A couple of more comments: we feel the boiler will work normally, should it be called upon to take the entire heat load. Since the radiators have demonstrated that they could handle the heat load, should the evaporator foul up again, it should be reserviced and turned off until it is needed.
Comm break.
129:37:33 Cunningham: Roger. Ron, there's only one comment I have to add to that that makes sense. I assume with high heat load then, we wouldn't have any problem. We do notice the difference in temperature in the spacecraft when the evaporator is running or not, but it seems like it runs a little bit all the time when it's on the line. The glycol evaporator outlet TEMP is regulated down under 45 most of the time. In the drop line completely well, we have a glycol evaporator outlet TEMP of 50 to 52 and sometimes a little higher. [Long pause]
129:38:06 Evans: Roger. We copy that.
129:38:09 Cunningham: So next time it shuts down, I will service it, and we will stand by on it. [Pause]
129:38:15 Evans: Roger.
129:38:18 Cunningham: Have any data yet? [Pause]
129:38:24 Evans: I got a little bit, right. We're sending the command for high bit rate. Stand by. [Long pause]
129:38:40 Evans: Okay. Looks good. We're reading 104 now. [Pause]
129:38:45 Cunningham: Roger. What are you reading now? [Pause]
129:38:52 Evans: 103.
129:38:55 Cunningham: Roger. The redundant component check is A-okay. [Pause]

This is Apollo Control 129 hours, 40 minutes. The Mercury has LOS. Guam does not acquire on this the 82 revolution. The next station to acquire will be the tracking ship Redstone at 130 hours, 5 minutes. We have two clocks from the Control Center supper imposed on the world map on your television monitor in the news center. The one at the top is the elapse time since lift-off. The one at the bottom is counting down to the de-orbit burn. These two clocks should read out the same at 129 hours, 50 minutes. About 9 minutes from now both clocks should read 129 hours, 50 minutes. The mid point between lift-off and SPS burn number 8, the de-orbit burn. The mission will continue for another 25 or 30 minutes after that de-orbit burn for the re-entry phase. But we are rapidly coming up on the mid point between lift-off and de-orbit. At 119 hours, 42 minutes this is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control 129 hours, 49 minutes 37 seconds, coming up on the mid-point between lift off and the nominal deorbit burn. Mark 1295000
This is Apollo Control at 150 hours, 4 minutes coming up on five minutes which will be the nominal point in the mission from lift-off to splash. Apollo 7 about to be acquired at Redstone now. The best estimate at present is that the reentry time from de-orbit burn to splash will be approximately 30 minutes. It can't be figured precisely at this time due to atmospheric elements and dispersion that might occur in the de-orbit burn but it will be on a order of thirty minutes; so we are at the mid-point now for lift-off to splash. Apollo 7 has been acquired now, although there has not been a call go up yet, we will stand by through this pass at the Redstone.

130:06:09 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. We would like to cycle O2 tank 2. Turn it on shortly and then we would like to see the OFF before we complete this pass. [Long pause]
130:06:22 Cunningham: Was that the O2 fan, Ron?
130:06:25 Evans: I'm sorry; O2 fan.
130:06:28 Cunningham: Roger. I'm running a DTO now, the one for the 60 percent on the CRYO tank. I've got both fans, both heaters OFF. I'm assuming when I finish this run on it that that DTO is complete. Can you verify that for me? [Long pause]
130:06:42 Evans: Roger. Negate my last on the fan switch, and we'll verify that shortly. [Long pause]
130:07:29 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston.
130:07:32 Cunningham: GO ahead.
130:07:33 Evans: Roger. That does complete the 60 percent. We still have one more at the low end prior to re-entry where it doesn't work out, doesn't conflict. [Long pause]
130:07:46 Cunningham: The onboard copy of the DTO, which I assume you have there, shows only 90 plus or minus 5 and 60 plus or minus 5 or last day. [Long pause]
130:08:04 Evans: Roger. We'll check on it now. [Long pause]
130:08:48 Evans: Walt, it looks like on the DTO there, that "or last day" should have been "and last day." [Pause]
130:08:57 Cunningham: Okay. I'll give you a hack on how long it takes to run this, and we'd like to find out if we can't work it in the last day. We'll see. [Pause]
130:09:04 Evans: Roger. Thank you.
130:09:06 Cunningham: I started it at about 129 hours and 45 minutes, I guess. [Pause]

130:50:48 Schirra (onboard): Regarding the sunrise, the color: the Earth itself is black, but the face of the airglow is a bright reddish orange, fading to a light orange - very light - almost to a white, then a purplish violet color, fading into a dark blue as it gets darker, and it's quite a dark blue [garble]. Here are the lights and it comes up to a rough spot on the edge and then pure black space. This sighting is at 130 hours, 51 minutes and 26 seconds.
130:51:30 Cunningham (onboard): You know - it's significant to me, Wally, that we do flare before your un into black skies. It's as wide as all the rest of the colors put together.
130:51:38 Schirra (onboard): It is, isn't it? It's pretty wide out there, isn't it?
130:51:42 Cunningham (onboard): Yes.
130:51:44 Cunningham (onboard): I'd like to have all the [garble] looking at it.
130:51:53 Schirra (onboard): You see that pinpoint down there? That really shows there, doesn't it? That's a definite purple.
130:51:57 Cunningham (onboard): Yes, it is a very definite [garble] back layer.
130:52:01 Schirra (onboard): Maybe it's just red a little bit.

MERCURY through GUAM (REV 83)
131:08:13 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. [Pause]
131:08:18 Schirra: Roger. Go ahead.
131:08:21 Evans: Roger. Read you.
131:08:23 Schirra: Thank you. [Pause]
131:08:31 Evans: 7, Houston. Got a couple of onboard readouts I would like to cut. [Pause]
131:08:38 Schirra: Go ahead.
131:08:39 Evans: Roger. Pyro battery voltages and batt C voltage. [Long pause]
131:08:51 Cunningham: Hey, Ron. We read the pyro battery voltage a little earlier this evening and passed it down. I guess it was before your shift, but they were both reading 37 volts. [Pause]
131:09:01 Evans: Roger. I missed it; sorry. [Pause]
131:09:08 Cunningham: Battery C is 36 volts. [Pause]
131:09:13 Evans: Roger. Copy. And could you check your O2 purge switch on fuel cell 2? [Long pause]
131:09:31 Cunningham: Thank you, Ron. [Long pause]
131:09:49 Cunningham: Hey, Ron. What are you guys reading out for the O2 tank pressures? [Pause]
131:09:58 Evans: O2 tank pressures?
131:10:01 Cunningham: Right. I've got the [garble] on. [Long pause]
131:10:32 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. We're reading 846 on tank 1 and 827 on tank 2. [Pause]
131:10:41 Cunningham: Roger. Thank you. [Long pause]
131:10:57 Evans: 7, Houston. The O2 flow looks good now on fuel cell 2, and you can continue with 3. And we could use a general rundown on your crew hesalth, the medication, and the amount of sleep, what have you. [Long pause]
131:11:16 Cunningham: Well, this is the LMP. I had another Actifed the night before last. That makes two I've had. My ears are getting more difficult to clear than they have been. Sometimes I can clear one, and sometimes I can't. I feel very good otherwise. I'm a little bit concerned about the lack of any nose drops such as Neosynephrin on board, and it seems to me if we had something like that, we'd be able to at least make a stab and let my ears get cleared on the reentry. [Long pause]
131:11:54 Evans: Roger. Copy that. Opposite omni, Apollo 7. [Long pause]
131:12:05 Schirra: Roger. We just got a group of islands on frame 97, magazine Sierra. That is at 13 hours, 11 minutes and 40 seconds. [Long pause]
131:12:23 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
131:12:32 Eisele: Hey, Ron. My sleep last night: I got, oh, about 7 hours of sleep which was very sound sleep, the best I've got coming up here, I guess. [Pause]
131:12:42 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
131:12:46 Schirra: I think we've all been averaging good sleep lately. Donn's been sleeping much better. He was the one who was way behind on sleep. And because we switched his day to - to go to bed at night at 4 o'clock which is pretty clever for anybody to try. [Long pause]
131:12:59 Evans: Right.
131:13:02 Schirra: And he is finally acclimated to that schedule. All three of us have varying forms of cold - various forms of cold. Mine is still a head cold, and that's about my problem. I'm off pills these days. [Long pause]
131:13:16 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
131:13:27 Cunningham: What do the doctors have in mind for head clearing on reentry? [Pause]
131:13:34 Evans: We're counting on three Actifed. [Pause]
131:13:42 Cunningham: You mean three per man? [Pause]
131:13:46 Evans: (Laughter) Negative. One each, Donn. [Pause]
131:13:53 Cunningham: Why don't you suggest to 'em that they do that as flight surgeons for airplane drivers? I haven't seen that work yet. [Pause]
131:14:02 Evans: Roger. We would use a hole in the helmet probablY, couldn't we? [Pause]
131:14:09 Schirra: I think that's what you're going to find. We'll come in with our helmets off. [Pause]
131:14:17 Evans: Roger. We will advise.
131:14:20 Schirra: You could try. How's that for a B52 status report? (Laughter) [Long pause]
131:15:02 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. I've got a couple of comments on TV. [Pause]
131:15:07 Schirra: Go ahead.
131:15:10 Evans: Roger. On the ALC switch ...
131:15:13 Schirra: [Garble] go ahead, Ron.
131:15:14 Evans: Roger. On the ALC switch, have it out - ALC out - when the windows or flood lights are in the field of view or when you're panning across the spacecraft. This will give a better picture of the darker areas. [Long pause]
131:15:35 Schirra: Roger.
131:15:36 Evans: And, of course, have it in when light sources are not in the field of view. [Pause]
131:15:45 Schirra: Okay.
131:15:46 Evans: And when the flashlight - down there - when the flashlight shines directly on an area, this area only shows up as a white blob. So it's good for pointing, but it doesn't help the picture at all. [Long pause]
131:16:01 Schirra: Okay. Let's see, we'll dolly up and - on our screen [garble] tomorrow morning. [Long pause]
131:16:13 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
131:16:35 Evans: Walt, the doctor recommends one more Actifed prior to sleep tonight, if you feel necessary. [Long pause]
131:16:46 Cunningham: I don't feel like it does me a bit of good. [Pause]
131:16:56 Evans: Roger. We still feel it'll probably help a little though. [Pause]
131:17:00 Cunningham: For the last 2 or 3 days, there's been a heck of a lot. We don't have that much on board. We got enough for pain and seasickness and stuff like that, but nothing for colds. [Long pause]
131:17:23 Evans: Roger. We're kind of in the same position down here, also, when you get a cold. [Pause]
131:17:29 Cunningham: Roger. That's right.

This is Apollo Control 131 hours and 19 minutes. Guam has LOS now. That was a fairly long pass over the Mercury and the Guam. We got some onboard readouts on the battery voltages and gave the crew some oxygen tank pressures at their request. It's pretty good communication this time. I'll hit the high spots however of their health reports. The lunar module pilot, Walt Cunningham, reported he has taken two decongestant tablets to date in the mission that - the last one was the night before last. He voiced the wish that he had some nose drops onboard with him. Said he got about seven hours sleep last night, sound sleep, he thought it was the best sleep he'd had yet. Wally Schirra, the commander, said he believes all of the crewmen have been averaging good sleep lately. He reported he still has his head cold, that he's off pills and he indicated that the crew may reenter with their helmets off so that they will be able to relieve the pressure on their ears if their ears are still stopped up at the time of reentry. There was also a discussion, we passed up some advice to them that may enable better TV pictures. Persons in the Houston area will have a choice to make. Tomorrow morning they can either step outside and attempt to see the spacecraft pass over in the Houston or they can stay in and watch the television. The television is due at 7:15 AM Central daylight time that is the same pass on which Apollo 7 may be visible. The S-IVB, the second stage of the launch vehicle may also be visible from Houston tomorrow. The S-IVB will approach from the southwest at 7:10 AM, reach a maximum elevation of 27 degrees due south at 7:14 AM and disappear over the horizon due east at 7:17 AM. Apollo 7, the command and service module will approach from the southwest at 7:16 AM, reach maximum elevation of 30 degrees due south at 7:20 AM and leave due east 7:25 AM. The next station to acquire will the Redstone at 131 hours, 39 minutes. This is Mission Control Houston.

132:05:51 Eisele: Hey, Ron. You got any dope on the Olympics this morning? [Pause]
132:05:57 Evans: Say again, Donn.
132:06:00 Eisele: We were just wondering who were the latest gold medal winners down in Mexico. [Pause]
132:06:08 Evans: Roger. Like to check a couple of switches there first, and then I'll pass it up to you. Can you check your O2 tank 1 and 2 heater switch to the AUTO position? [Long pause]
132:06:24 Eisele: Roger. Ron, I got 1 in AUTO and 2 OFF. [Long pause]
132:06:35 Evans: Roger. Are those the heaters or fans? [Pause]
132:06:39 Eisele: Fans.
132:06:41 Evans: Roger. Those are - funs are correct. How about the heater switch? Are they both in AUTO? [Pause]
132:06:48 Eisele: [Garble] you want them OFF? [Pause]
132:06:55 Evans: Negative. We want them in the AUTO position. [Long pause]
132:07:38 Evans: Dorm, we had a couple of Gold Medal winners down there tonight. Bob Secru - Seagren, I'm sorry - won at pole vault at 17 feet 8 and 1/2 inches. [Long pause]
132:07:58 Eisele: Pretty tall reach.
132:08:00 Evans: Roger. And Tonny Smith won the 200 meter in 19.78. [Long pause]

132:08:58 Eisele: Hello, Houston to Apollo 7.
132:09:00 Evans: Houston. Go.
132:09:03 Eisele: Roger. Regarding the medicants and antibiotics and so forth, one of the reasons we don't have a temperature up here is that the thermometer is broken. We can't get it to go over 94, so we don't know if we've got a fever or not. [Long pause]
132:09:21 Evans: Roger. Understand.

132:10:39 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston.
132:10:42 Eisele: Roger. Go.
132:10:44 Evans: Roger. Be advised on your CMC power up. We'll update you a little later, but what we are going to try to do is to power it up over one station and then power it down over the other station, so we can take a look at some of the bits in there. [Long pause]
132:11:01 Eisele: Roger. Understand.
132:11:04 Evans: And we got a pretty good status of the other two guys' health. Can you give us kind of your rundown: health, medication, and sleep? [Long pause]
132:11:17 Eisele: Roger. I just woke uD. I got a good solid 8 hours sleep, and Walt and Wally are both in the sack, and I don't know, I think they may have called in their medicine. [Long pause]
132:11:31 Evans: Yes, we have theirs, but we didn't get yours. [Pause]
132:11:36 Eisele: Okay. At 132 hours, they each had two aspirins, and LMP recorded 15 clicks of water. [Long pause]
132:11:49 Evans: Roger.
132:11:51 Eisele: And I haven't had a drink yet, and I haven't taken any medicine lately. [Pause]
132:11:58 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
132:12:08 Eisele: Also, the commander had 20 clicks of water at 131:30. [Pause]

This is Apollo Control at 132 hours, 13 minutes, ascension LOS. That was the command module pilot, Don Eisele in this pass over Ascension. He's just up from his sleep period. He reports that Wally Schirra and Walt Cunningham have got into their sleeping bags, settling for 8 hours. He reported they - each took two aspirins at 132 hours elapsed time. That is the time their sleep period started. He reported he had gotten 8 solid hours of sleep, and that he has taken no medication lately. Also he reported that the thermometer is broken so they can't tell whether they have fevers or not. The next station toacquire will be the Mercury at 132 hours, 41 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.

132:41:43 Evans: Roger. Loud and clear, Donn.
132:41:45 Eisele: Okay. [Pause]
132:41:49 Eisele: Ron, I've got a couple of comments here that's relevant to program 23 navigation [garble]. [Pause]
132:41:56 Evans: Roger. Go.
132:41:58 Eisele: Okay. The reason we knocked that off yesterday was that when we got into attitude at the right time and everything [garble] rate for P23, there was no star in the sextant, and the horizon and such in the sextant. The fixed line of sight was very indistinct. In fact, it was pretty hard to pick out anything that you could use. There was one line that might pass for a repeatable line, but it was pretty tenuous. Subsequent to that, I did a P52 AUTO optics check and found that the star was up there, but it was at a slightly different shaft and trunnion angle. That was the reason we didn't pick it up. [Long pause]
132:42:35 Evans: Roger.
132:42:37 Eisele: So the gist of it all was that I don't think it was too worthwhile or realistic a way to perform that program, or it wasn't designed to be used that way, so I suggest that if we have any time or fuel later in the flight, we try to use the lunar landmarks and stars. [Long pause]

132:45:11 Evans: Roger.
132:45:13 Eisele: When did you want to do that? Are you talking about the normal power up for the next sequence of activity? [Pause]
132:45:22 Evans: Negative. The CMC update is about 135 hours, somewhere around there. [Pause]
132:45:27 Eisele: Oh, yes. Okay. [Long pause]
132:46:12 Eisele: We could do it now and power down over the Canaries. [Pause]
132:46:18 Evans: Roger. Stand by. [Long pause]
132:46:37 Evans: Roger. Donn, you can go ahead and power it up now. We'll power it up over Guam and then power down over Redstone. [Pause]
132:46:44 Eisele: Okay. [Long pause]
132:46:55 Eisele: Well, that's cute. [Long pause]

134:47:55 Pogue: Roger. 087 dash 2 Alpha plus 266 minus 0270 136 29 19 3483, 088 dash 1 Bravo plus 230 minus 0600 137 54 53 3591, 089 dash 1 Alpha plus 292 minus 0622 139 30 06 3430, 090 1 Bravo plus 314 minus 0620 141 06 07 3386, 091 dash 1 Alpha plus 291 minus 0622 142 42 26 3541, 092 dash 1 Alpha plus 224 minus 0630 144 16 25 3073. Standing by for readback.
134:50:37 Eisele: Okay. 087 dash 2 Alpha plus 266 minus 0270 136 29 19 3483, 088 dash 1 Bravo plus 200 minus - is that 20 or 230? [Long pause]
134:50:59 Pogue: Plus 230. [Pause]
134:51:06 Eisele: Roger. Can't read my own writing. Plus 230 minus 0600 137 54 53 3591, 089 dash 1 Alpha plus 292 minus 0622 139 30 06 3430, 090 dash 1 Bravo plus 314 minus 0620 141 06 07 3386, 091 dash 1 Alpha plus 291 minus 0622 142 42 26 3541, 092 dash 1 Alpha plus 224 minus 0630 144 16 25 3073. [Long pause]
134:51:58 Pogue: Readback is correct.
134:52:01 Eisele: Okay. Could you give me a map update and also a star chart update? [Pause]
134:52:06 Pogue: Roger. Stand by. [Long pause]
134:53:01 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. I have the map and star chart updates. [Pause]
134:53:05 Eisele: Roger. Go ahead.
134:53:07 Pogue: REV 85 nodal crossing 133 plus 39 plus 58, 33.0 west. For the map, right ascension is 414. [Long pause]
134:53:37 Eisele: Roger. Understand. Say again the [garble] right ascension. [Pause]
134:53:42 Pogue: 414. [Pause]
134:53:46 Eisele: Roger. I got you. Thank you.
134:53:49 Pogue: Okay. [Long pause]
134:54:30 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni, please. [Long pause]
134:54:44 Eisele: Roger. [Long pause]
134:55:16 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Redstone; Canaries at 17. [Pause]
134:55:23 Eisele: Okay.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control 134 hours, 55 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We've just lost acquisition at Redstone tracking ship. We're anticipating Canary Islands at 135 hours and 17 minutes. This is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control, 13S hours, 17 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We're beginning our eighty sixth revolution. We're coming upon Canary Island acquistion in a very few seconds. Let's listen in.
CANARY (REV 86)
135:17:48 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston through Canary. [Pause]
135:17:52 Eisele: Roger.
135:17:54 Pogue: Donn, I have rather extensive explanation regardlng this landmark tracking. I'd like to start passing it up. It's a lot of verbiage, but I don't know how else to do it. [Long pause]
135:18:11 Eisele: Okay. Stand by. [Long pause]
135:18:23 Eisele: Go ahead, Bill.
135:18:26 Pogue: Right. I guess when I get through here, all the talk is going to result in about only two changes in the procedure. I would like to go through it so you get an idea of the thinking that has been going here.
Comm break.
135:19:46 Eisele: Okay. Go ahead.
135:19:47 Pogue: All right. First point: tomorrow, we will perform landmark tracking on the three revs scheduled in the flight plan, that is, on 90, 91, and 92. And second point: on yesterday's or today's - it depends on how you look at it - landmark tracking, the following problem resulted in AUTO optics not acquiring on all three landmarks; or to say another way, this is the reason AUTO optics didn't work. The trunnion will not drive until the computed trunnion is less than 38 degrees. The shaft is driving at this time which gives the impression that it is acquiring. And apparently, you started out with zero optics, and with zero optics when the less than 38-degree trunnion occurs, the optics have then approximately 38 degrees to drive in trunion to acquire the landmark. Now, this 38 degrees plus a possible overshoot results in the thing hunting ground and the AUTO optics not acquiring. [Long pause]
135:20:22 Eisele: Okay. Bill, I know all that. What happened yesterday is that it never came out of zeros that I could tell. Even when the target got within the 38 degrees, it did not appear to drive. Also, on one of the landmarks, it was beyond the 38-degree limit the whole time. It was way off to one side. [Long pause]
135:20:41 Pogue: Roger. Okay. I was afraid of that. [Pause]
135:20:46 Eisele: You see, I don't know all about how it is supposed to work. It didn't because the one landmark - in fact, on two of them, it was beyond the field of view. [Long pause]
135:20:58 Pogue: On two of them, it was beyond the field of view?
135:21:00 Eisele: I know what happened. It never moved off center even when it got within 38 degrees. Right now, it is supposed to drive out and pick it up when you get within 38 degrees of it. [Long pause]
135:21:12 Pogue: Okay. I got the picture. Two of the landmarks given to you were actually beyond the limits. And one of them, even after you got it within the 38 degrees, never went off the stops in trunnion. [Long pause]
135:21:26 Eisele: Well, that's what it appeared to me; yes.
135:21:28 Pogue: Okay. Thank you. Sorry; I didn't mean to belabor that point. [Pause]
135:21:32 Eisele: No, that's okay. I understand what you mean. My point about it not working: it doesn't do you any good. I guess that is the point. [Pause]
135:21:40 Pogue: Okay. If it doesn't work, this procedure I was getting ready to go through is not going to be good either. But let me stand by and take another look at this before I occupy your time. [Long pause]
135:21:51 Eisele: That's okay. Go ahead and read it up first. [Pause]
135:21:56 Pogue: Okay. They - the net point was the first landmark may have been too far out of plane. Apparently, that's correct from what you said. On the second landmark, you may not have waited until the less than the 38-degree constraint was met before starting. Apparently, this is the time it wouldn't come off zero. [Long pause]
135:22:20 Eisele: Now, wait a minute. That's not true. I waited until Walt said he saw the thing out the window, and then I went for it manually. By that time, it was almost up to the center of the [garble] or well within the 38 degrees, and I did attempt to get on it and track it, but it was so close to center by then the optics couldn't keep up on it. [Long pause]
135:22:40 Pogue: Okay.
135:22:41 Eisele: It never did drive out there automatically to pick it up?
135:22:43 Pogue: Roger. That's the point.
135:22:44 Eisele: [Garble] zero and the shaft rolled around.
135:22:46 Pogue: Okay. Well, that's the point you were just making then. Okay. On the - on the third landmark, you keyed in a plus sign on the latitude. I don't know what that means, other than maybe there was a wrong algebraic sign. [Long pause]
135:23:00 Eisele: Okay. That was my goof. That was also beyond the field of view, and AISO had to go over and work mannually, and it was still ... [Pause]
135:23:08 Pogue: Okay. That was another one that was beyond ...
135:23:09 Eisele: I was looking out the side window on that one, also.
135:23:12 Pogue: Okay. Thank you.
135:23:15 Eisele: What I thought was when they - apparently when these guys say in the south, they really mean south, which means we've got to roll maybe 15 - 20 degrees even to see it, which is a little bit far because that puts it way out in a strange oblique angle. [Long pause]
135:23:29 Pogue: Right. Okay. One more item. The following changes to procedures should result in successful AUTO optics. A is - I am sure you're already doing this, Donn, but I am going to go through it anyway. To provide earlier acquisition time, revise step 5 in the procedure, which I doubt you are even using, to get the spacecraft equal to 10 degrees versus 23 degrees. And I think from you said down at the Cape, you were using 10 degrees. [Long pause]
135:24:02 Eisele: That's what we have been using all along; yes.
135:24:04 Pogue: I didn't change the cheklist, and that is my goof. Okay. And also - I guess the point that is a little bit different here - I hadn't - I didn't know about it. When you call up - before you call up P22 manually, let me get this. Call P22, execute procedure through onboard checklist except manually position shaft zero, trunnion 35 degrees prior to ENTER. [Long pause]
135:24:34 Eisele: Stand by. [Pause]
135:24:42 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. We are coming up on LOS; we'll pick you up at - S-band volume up at Honeysuckle. [Long pause]
135:24:54 Eisele: Okay.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control; 135 hours, 25 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We have just lost acquistion at Canary Islands. Our next acquisition point will again be the Redstone Tracking Ship at 136:21. We're now in our eighty sixth revolution. You heard astronaut Eisele talk to CapCom Pogue here in the control center at some length concerning the auto optics. And the reason yesterday they did not function on the landmark tracking problems as they should have. Seemingly, centering around trunnion problems and landmarks being beyond the limits of auto optics system. At 135 hours, 25 minutes this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 136 hours, 21 minutes into the mission. We now have voice acquisition at Redstone tracking ship. Let's listen in.
REDSTONE (REV 86)
136:21:01 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
136:21:14 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. [Long pause]
136:21:31 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone. [Pause]
136:21:35 Eisele: Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
136:21:38 Pogue: We'll try to carry on with this, finish up the little blurb I have here on landmark tracking. [Pause]
136:21:47 Eisele: Okay. Go ahead.
136:21:48 Pogue: Okay. This involves a suggested change in the procedure. At step 6 in the checklist, which is the perfom AUTO optics position code, code 11 - and it is a suggested change prior to the ENTER following that code 11 - the idea is that after this step 6, before you hit the ENTER button, mannually position shaft zero, trunnion 35 degrees, trunnion 35 degrees.
136:22:35 Eisele: Okay. They need to put it in CMC?
136:22:38 Pogue: Yes, affirmative. That's correct, and then optics mode to CMC and then ENTER. [Pause]
136:22:46 Eisele: Okay. I think I see what you're driving at.
136:22:48 Pogue: Right.
136:22:49 Eisele: Do it that way.
136:22:50 Pogue: Roger. It sets the trunnion to a better initial value to minimize the AUTO optics acquisition time. [Pause]
136:22:58 Eisele: Okay.
136:23:00 Pogue: Let's see. Couple more items here. If unable to acquire target, then track unknown landmarks such as coastlines, clouds, et cetera. [Long pause]
136:23:15 Eisele: Roger. That's a good deal.
136:23:18 Pogue: After landmark tracking, we want to perform a sextant star observation with approximately 35-degree line of sight to the Sun. The scanning telescope test data correlates well with what was predicted, and we are satisfied with that data. After this test, the star count test will be closed. [Long pause]
136:23:47 Eisele: Roger. Say again. You want to do what now?
136:23:50 Pogue: After landmark tracking, we want to perform a sextant star observation with approximately 35-degree line of sight to the Sun. [Long pause]
136:24:03 Eisele: Oh, I see what you mean. Okay. [Pause]
136:24:07 Pogue: We will update that in the flight plan. By the way, that flight plan update I'll start over Antigua. [Pause]
136:24:16 Eisele: Roger.
136:24:17 Pogue: One final item. We are considering star lunar horizon sightings for later in the flight. [Pause]
136:24:25 Eisele: Roger. You better make it pretty soon. That Sun is going lower each day. It's receding toward the east, and there isn't much left now - much space between it and the Sun, I mean. [Pause]
136:24:35 Pogue: Roger. Okay.
136:24:38 Eisele: I was thinking perhaps - Bill, are you still there?
136:24:41 Pogue: Roger. Go.
136:24:43 Eisele: After the last landmark pass, on that night pass, following that, if we perhaps could do the sextant check then sextant - I mean, the lunar landmark set check. [Long pause]
136:24:58 Pogue: We'll take a look at that. Sounds like a good idea.
136:25:01 Eisele: Bill, I've been watching it come up, and it's in a good position. I can use any one of about three stars, plus I think I can either get a landmark or the lunar - or the limb of the Moon, either one. But it's receding toward the east, and if we wait another day or two, I'm afraid we're not going to have any nighttime left with the Moon up. [Long pause]
136:25:19 Pogue: Well, that's a good point. Were those three stars you mentioned, were those Apollo stars? [Pause]
136:25:25 Eisele: Yes. There's Alpheratz and Procyon, and there's one other one - I'll have to look - Regulus, except it's a little too close. [Pause]
136:25:34 Pogue: Okay. Thank you. [Pause]
136:25:38 Eisele: Oh, Denebola. [Pause]
136:25:43 Pogue: Donn, would you turn the O2 tank 2 fans on for about 3 minutes? [Pause]
136:25:49 Eisele: Sure will. [Long pause]
136:26:22 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7.
136:26:24 Pogue: Go.
136:26:25 Eisele: Roger. I've got a comment relative to that star count. I hope the daylight star people are not reading too much into these results we're getting. The fact is unless you can see 40 or 50 stars out there, you can't see enough to really say what part of the sky you're looking at. [Long pause]
136:26:44 Pogue: Okay. I've got it written down.
136:26:47 Eisele: I guess the point is they are hard to identify. Even though you can see goodly numbers sometimes, you don't know what they are. [Pause]
136:26:53 Pogue: Right.
Comm break.
136:29:02 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Redstone. You can turn those fans back off, and we'll have Antigua at 39. [Long pause]
136:29:13 Eisele: Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control 136 hours, 29 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We are completing our 86th revolution going into our 87th revolution very shortly. Anticipating contact with Antigua at 36 hours, 39 minutes into the missioh. That pass you heard astronaut Pogue in the Control Center and astronaut Eisele in the spacecraft have a conversation concerning landmark tracking, sextant star observation, they're considering star lunar horizon sightings later on in the flight, had some conversation'concerning that. Eisele also indicated that the stars are hard to identify. At 136 hours, 30 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control, 136 hours, 39 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We're coming upon acquistion with Antigua Tracking Station, beginning our eighty seventh revolution. Let's listen at it.
ANTIGUA (REV 87)
136:40:08 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
136:40:42 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston through Antigua. I have a flight plan update when you get ready to copy. [Long pause]
136:40:55 Eisele: Stand by a minute.
136:40:57 Pogue: Okay. Stand by. [Long pause]
136:41:18 Eisele: Go ahead, Bill.
136:41:20 Pogue: Roger. We'll he starting on page 2 dash 48 at about 140 hours - and over there in the box where it says GO/NO-GO 106 dash 1 - the next item is state vector, and - let's see, we'll be passing that up at 142:43. [Long pause]
136:41:51 Eisele: Roger. That's your time tag?
136:41:53 Pogue: That's the time tag, excuse me. That's correct. [Pause]
136:42:00 Eisele: Okay.
136:42:01 Pogue: And delete the reference to the W-matrix. And for the landmarks, we will have a T align of 141 plus 14. [Long pause]
136:42:24 Eisele: Roger. Understand. T align of 141 plus 14. [Pause]
136:42:28 Pogue: Affirmative. And at that time, you'll also get landmark ID updates. [Pause]
136:42:35 Eisele: Okay.
136:42:38 Pogue: On next page at 140 hours, all "Set up TV." [Pause]
136:42:48 Eisele: Say again time.
136:42:49 Pogue: 140 hours. [Pause]
136:42:53 Eisele: Roger. Set up TV. [Pause]
136:43:01 Pogue: At 141 plus 12, add "TV ON." This is 2 minutes before Texas acquisition.
136:43:XX Eisele: Roger. TV on at 141 plus 2.
136:43:XX Pogue: Affirmative. At 141 plus 30 add, "Fuel cell O2 purge.
136:43:48 Eisele: Okay. Fuel cell purge at 30 for oxygen. [Pause]
136:43:53 Pogue: Affirmative. At 142 plus 35, replace the nine-by-nine with a three-by-three. On the P22 orbital NAV, there is a parenthetical insertion there, "nine-by-nine". Make that "three-by-three." [Long pause]
136:44:24 Eisele: I don't understand. We don't do that on board, do we? [Pause]
136:44:29 Pogue: Negative. [Pause]
136:44:34 Eisele: I'll skip that -
136:44:35 Pogue: Okay. Okay. Sory. Okay. Now at 143 plus 40, add "State vector update, P52 permitting." What that means is they'll give you a state vector update, and, if it doesn't interfere with the P52, [garble]. [Long pause]
136:45:08 Eisele: Okay. What time is this, 143:30? [Pause]
136:45:12 Pogue: 143 plus 40. [Pause]
136:45:16 Eisele: Okay, Bill.
CANARY (REV 87)
136:45:20 Pogue: And we need opposite omni. [Long pause]
136:45:48 Pogue: You still reading me, Apollo 7? [Pause]
136:45:54 Eisele: Roger. Go ahead.
136:45:55 Pogue: Okay. I thought maybe we had lost you there. At 145 plus 20, "State vector update, P52 permitring", and again that means if it doesn't interfere with P52. [Long pause]
136:46:19 Eisele: Okay.
136:46:22 Pogue: At 146 hours replace that box over there, "Scanning telescope star count," and make that "Sextant star count." [Long pause]
136:46:43 Eisele: Okay.
136:46:46 Pogue: Now, at 146 plus 40, we put a P23 in there for midcourse, and that's the one you were just talking about, I think. We just added that. [Long pause]
136:47:03 Eisele: Can you say that one again?
136:47:05 Pogue: At 146 plus 35 or 40, somewhere right along in there. [Pause]
136:47:14 Eisele: What are you going to do there?
136:47:16 Pogue: P23 midcourse.
136:47:19 Eisele: Oh, okay.
136:47:21 Pogue: We just stuck that in there in response to your remarks. [Pause]
136:47:26 Eisele: All right. [Pause]
136:47:31 Pogue: We're coming up on LOS; I'll pick you up in Canary.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, 136 hours, 47 minutes into the mission. We had a series of flight plan updates in that pass as we heard. In 140 hours, they'll set up a TV; 141 hours, 12 minutes the TV will be turned on which be 2 minutes before Texas acquisition tomorrow or rather this morning. We have several minutes to wait before the pass at Canary Islands, 2 minutes to be exact. So we'll standby for conversation at Canary Islands.
CANARY (REV 87)
136:51:00 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston through Canary. How do you read? [Pause]
136:51:05 Eisele: Loud and clear.
136:51:06 Pogue: Very good. I'll continue on with this thing. At 147 hours in your flight plan, there is a telescope star count, and - with the sun line of sight and so forth. Just make that co-entry there a sextant star count, and that's it. [Long pause]
136:51:35 Eisele: Okay. [Pause]
136:51:43 Pogue: Okay. At 148 hours on the - on page 2 dash 51, 148 hours - G&N and also SCS power down. [Long pause]
136:51:58 Eisele: Roger.
136:51:59 Pogue: Delete the entry down at 149 plus 30 hours where it says that G&N power down and SCS power down; just scratch through that. [Long pause]
136:52:13 Eisele: Roger.
136:52:15 Pogue: And right above, at 149 plus 10, delete "P23 star horizon sightings." [Long pause]
136:52:27 Eisele: Roger. Delete horizon sightings. [Pause]
136:52:31 Pogue: Over on the next column, at 150 plus 05, H2 heaters ON. And at - [Long pause]
136:52:52 Eisele: Okay.
136:52:53 Pogue: - at 150 plus 25, "Fuel cell H2 purge." [Long pause]
136:53:07 Eisele: Got it. [Pause]
136:53:11 Pogue: Okay. That's the end of the update. Have a relative listing of priorities which are probably well familiar to you, but I'll pass them on up anyway. In order of priority, most important first, the P22, a minimum of two successful revs and three landmarks each rev. The P52's, two of them during the night pass between the P22's; and then third and lowest priority, the sextant star count. [Long pause]
136:53:45 Eisele: Roger. Got it.
136:53:46 Pogue: Okay. That is the end of the update.
136:53:49 Eisele: Okay.
Long comm break.
136:58:34 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up LOS Cunary; we'll have Carnarvon at 27.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, 136 hours, 58 minutes into the mission. We have lost of signal at Canaries. We will pick up Canarvon at 137:27. One interesting thing that has peen indicated to Flight Director, Griffin on this shift is that the SVI-B stage, Saturn Booster, should reenter at 166 hours ground elapsed time. That's the seventh day into the mission. At 136 hours, 59 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 137 hours, 27 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We're coming up on Carnarvon at this time, we should have acquisition shortly, let's listen in.
CARNARVON (REV 87)

Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control 137 hours, 33 minutes into the mission of Apoll 7. We're standing by through the Honeysuckle pass for some - another some seven minutes. It does not appear that there will be any more voice conversation but we'll stand by anyway.

137:36:33 Pogue: Roger. I was just announcing acquisition Honeysucle. [Pause]
137:36:38 Eisele: Roger. Coming in fine this time.
137:36:41 Pogue: Good. I'm reading you five-by, too. [Long pause]
137:37:02 Eisele: I just took some neat pictures over Australia. At least, I hope they turn out neat. [Pause]
137:37:07 Pogue: Good. Do you have the frame numbers or anything?
137:37:10 Eisele: Yes. Stand by. I'll get it squared away and bring it up for you.
137:37:13 Pogue: Okay. How are you feeling today?
137:37:15 Eisele: Oh, pretty good.
137:37:18 Pogue: Did you sleep pretty solid last night? [Pause]
137:37:22 Eisele: Yes; sure did.
137:37:24 Pogue: Good. [Long pause]
137:37:37 Eisele: Okay. These are frames 116 through 123. [Pause]
137:37:43 Pogue: 116 through 123.
137:37:46 Eisele: Roger. And the time was 137 hours, 30 minutes through about 34 minutes. [Pause]
137:37:54 Pogue: Roger. 137 plus 30 through 137 plus 40. [Pause]
137:38:00 Eisele: Negative. Thirty-four.
137:38:02 Pogue: Thirty-four; I understand.
137:38:03 Eisele: About a 4-minute period there.
137:38:05 Pogue: Roger. Understand. Four-minute period. How's the camera working? [Long pause]
137:38:17 Eisele: It's holding up real well.
137:38:19 Pogue: Thought I heard Walt say something the other day about it not working right, or you were having some trouble with it. [Pause]
137:38:25 Eisele: Well, we were, earlier in the flight. Seemed to be gumed up. [Pause]
137:38:29 Pogue: Good.
137:38:31 Eisele: But Wally took some - there was some old grease in there, real gummy stuff - he got that out of there. We put in a little light oil that we had in our medical kit, that nose cream. [Long pause]
137:38:42 Pogue: Roger.
137:38:44 Eisele: It's been working pretty well ever since. [Long pause]
137:39:28 Eisele: Bill, log me another 20 clicks of water, please.
137:39:31 Pogue: Roger. Twenty clicks. Also, Donn, have a question regarding the - when you make a water dump, how - you know you reported that it affected the optics for a period of time, and a question: how long does it affect your ability to see through the optics when you make a dump? [Long pause]
137:40:03 Eisele: Roger. Well, what happens is that anytime that you dump fluids [garble] they turn to ice crystals, and the Sun reflects off of them, and it's millions of them out there. Usually during a water dump or urine dump - why, it will persist for - oh, 3 or 4 minutes anyway; in fact, sometimes longer than that. [Long pause]
137:40:25 Pogue: Roger.
137:40:26 Eisele: Also [garble] know once in a while when you're driving the optics in shaft, you see little flakes of something come out on account of that. I don't know what the source of that reflection is. [Long pause]
137:40:38 Pogue: Okay; But from the time you first see this stuff - these crystals - it takes 3 or 4 minutes for them to disperse enoughso that the optics are usable again. Is that a correct assumption? [Pause]
137:40:48 Eisele: At least that long. It may be longer than that. Usually what happens is you're either in complete darkness or complete daylight within that 3- or 4-minute period; so I really couldn't say if you were in deep space how long it would take for those to disperse. [Long pause]
137:41:02 Pogue: Okay.
137:41:04 Eisele: I think the message is - say, on the translunar operation, you would not want to be dumping water anytime soon before your optics operations. [Long pause]
137:41:16 Pogue: Okay. I've got that copied down. Also, while I'm bugging you, I've got a question here from the medic. He wants to knov if you coughed about 2 m'inutes ago. [Long pause]
137:41:31 Eisele: (Laughter) Matter of fact, I did. I was drinking a dringk of water, and there was some - gas came out of the water gun. [Pause]
137:41:40 Pogue: Okay. And did you turn your head?
137:41:42 Eisele: (Laughter) No, I did not.

139:45:37 Pogue: Donn, could We have ACCEPT, please? And we'll go ahead and sesd up that NAV vector. [Pause]
139:45:42 Eisele: Roger. Got it. [Pause]
139:45:49 Pogue: Roger. Donn, you don't need those shaft and trunnion angles. I shouldn't have sent those up. [Pause]
139:45:55 Eisele: That's okay. I like to have them.
139:45:58 Pogue: But you're right; it's to one decimal place. [Long pause]

139:51:52 Pogue: Hey, Donn, you're right. That should be 311, 311 degrees. In other words, that was a minus 49 there. [Long pause]
139:52:12 Eisele: Oh, I get it. [Pause]
139:52:20 Eisele: Bill, I gather then these shaft and trunnion angles mean that with the zero roll angle, that's where the target will appear in the field of view. [Pause]
139:52:27 Pogue: That is my impression, and I'll get that straightened out, too. [Pause]
139:52:31 Eisele: Roger.

This is Apollo Control, 140 hours, 6 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We have lost our signal at Canary Island Tracking Station at this time. Our next acquisition point will be Canarvon at 140:33, At 140:06, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control, 140 hours, 15 minutes into the mission of Apollo 7. We'll have a wrapup of the activities for the past 8 hours or going on 8 hours. And we will start back at revolution 84, 133 hours, 13 minutes into the mission. It was at a time when astronaut Eisele indicated that he had 30 clicks of water or 13 ounces and two aspirins. He had some contact with the ground. Schirra and Cunningham were in their sleeping bags and sleep mode. Things were very quiet through this night time. They gave at 133 hours, 47 minutes the current cryogenic quantities were given in the form of plus 66 pounds of oxygen. In other words, 66 more pounds of oxygen than had been planned for, plus 1 pound of hydrogen up to that point in the mission. Information came in that the S-IV reentry - that's the S-IVB stage of the Saturn launch vehicle that is in orbit presently - should be 166 hours. That's the seventh day of the mission it should reenter the Earth's atmosphere. They have updates on the flight plan. At 135 hours, 17 minutes, astronaut Pogue, the CapCom, indicating that landmark tracking would occur during revolutions 90, 91, and 92. Landmark tracking - of yesterday wasn't so good because the optics didn't out too well. There was a trunnion problem. Eisele indicated at 136 hours, 21 minutes, in looking for stars they were hard to identify even if there was a star field with several stars apparent. The stars themselves individually were hard to identify. At revolution 87, 137 hours, Eisele indicated he just took some neat pictures of Australia. And he also indicated going back a bit that he had slept well. He also said that harkening back to a problem with their camera - the camera was working well. And again told about taking out the gummy grease as he called it and putting nose cream - applying nose cream to parts of the camera. And now it was operating very nicely. He also indicated at that time twenty more clicks of water. That's 10 ounces. And in a conversation with Pogue here in the Control Center, we've talked about water dumps interfering with the optics operations. In that interference - it seemed to be the water dump turns to an icy crisp - or turns to icy crystals after the dump. And for 3 or 4 minutes at least, the optics are sort of unusable. And then they are usable again after the ice crystals clear away. Things were very quiet - up through Carnarvon. At 138 hours, 59 minutes in revolution 88 When Eisele indicated he was powering up a little bit early to get the P51 program which is the inertial measuring unit - going in a night pass. He wanted to get it operational in the night pass and he was doing it at that time. At 139 hours, 41 minutes, there was a landmark update. And had a GO for 106-1 which means 105 revolutions. The flight plan update for today - indicates that for the most part we have orbital navigation, landmark trackings, sextant star counts, and we have synoptic weather photography S006 photography, a synoptic weather of the south Atlantic and of North Africa and we have terrain photography, synoptic terrain photography, S005 experiments, taking pictures of Lake Chad area in North Africa and the southwest coast of Africa. The command module computer will be powered up but the spacecraft positioning will be controlled by the astronaut's use of the manual attitude hand controller, for such attitudes that they should have. That update goes through 152 hours of the mission. We are now at 140 hours, 21 minutes. The television schedule for today, Thursday, is 7:15 am. They will unstow, or have unstowed, and set up the TV at 140 hours into the mission, or 22 minutes ago, and they are scheduled to power up the camera at 141 hours, 12 minutes into the mission. That will be about 2 minutes before Texas acquisition. We have on the sighting table for this morning on the 17th of October, for the S-IVB stage, it will approach from the southwest at 7:10 am, Central Daylight Time, maximum elevation 27 degrees due south at 7:14 am, Central Daylight Time, and it will leave us here in Texas going due east at 7:17 am, and it should be visible. The command and service module approached from the southwest at 7:16 am maximum elevation 30 degrees due south at 7:20 am and will leave due east 7:23 am. At 140 hours, 23 minutes into the mission, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 140 hours, 34 minutes into the mission. At the present time the spacecraft is coming up on the Carnarvon, Australian tracking center and we anticipate that the crew would be having breakfast at this time. Wally Schirra and Walt Cunningham having completed their sleep cycles and we'll stand by here as CapCom Jack Swigert prepares to put in a call to the crew over Carnarvon. At the present time here in the Control Center, we are undergoing a change of shifts with flight director Glynn Lunney's team coming on to replace that of flight director Gerry Griffin and our CapCom at the present time is Astronaut Jack Swigert who has just put in a call to the crew. We'll pick up that conversation now over Carnarvon.
CARNARVON (REV 89)
140:34:05 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
140:34:09 Eisele: Roger, Houston. [Pause]
140:34:19 Swigert: Donn, we'd like to get an open circuit battery check. It'll require pulling a circuit breaker here. [Pause]
140:34:29 Eisele: Okay. Go ahead. What do you want?
140:34:31 Swigert: Okay. First, we'd like to put the DC indicator switch to either MAIN A or MAIN B. [Pause]
140:34:38 Eisele: Okay. It's on MAIN A.
140:34:40 Swigert: Okay. And then on panel 5, we'd like to open the following circuit breaker: the batt relay bus batt A circuit breaker. [Long pause]
140:34:54 Eisele: Stand by. [Long pause]
140:35:06 Eisele: Roger. Batt relay bus batt A going open now. [Pause]
140:35:10 Swigert: Okay. And we're going to leave it open here to get some time data. We'll close it just before LOS Honeysuckle. [Long pause]
140:35:22 Eisele: Okay.
140:35:23 Swigert: What we'll do is we'll repeat the following procedure for battery B over the States. [Pause]
140:35:30 Eisele: Okay. [Pause]
140:35:36 Swigert: And, Donn, on the question yon had on the sextant star count: what we had done before was the scanning telescope star count. This is little different; we get a 37-degree LOS with the Sun. [Long pause]
140:35:55 Eisele: Roger. I understand. I thought the sextant count was to be used in case the telescope count didn't pan out, and since we did get - we did succeed in getting star counts on two lines of sight there, I don't understand why we have to do it again. I've already verified that you can see stars in the sextant in the daytime. [Long pause]
140:36:18 Swigert: Okay. stand by. [Long pause]
140:36:38 Swigert: Donn, it's the line of sight that they feel that's important. We haven't done anything quite that close to the sun before. [Long pause]
140:36:54 Eisele: Roger. We'll discuss it and call you back later. That's eating into my sleep time for one thing, so I guess Walt can do it then. [Pause]
140:37:00 Swigert: Okay. This is the last test we're going to do on that, Donn. [Pause]
140:37:05 Eisele: Okay. [Long pause]
140:38:01 Swigert: And, Donn, could you place your O2 tank 2 fans ON for 3 minutes then OFF? [Pause]
140:38:09 Eisele: Roger. Two going ON.
Comm break.
140:39:51 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7. Over.
140:39:53 Swigert: Good morning, Walt. [Pause]
140:39:58 Cunningham: Roger. Morning reports seem to indicate that we're not leaking any more out in this cabin. Partial pressure O2 is still 245 mm. [Long pause]
140:40:09 Swigert: Boger. Copied that. [Long pause]
140:40:39 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We got about 1 minute LOS Carnarvon. You want to turn up your S-hand volume for Honeysuckle. [Pause]
140:40:48 Cunningham: Roger.
Long comm break.
This is Mission Control. We'll have a brief dropout of signal now as the spacecraft passes out of range of the Carnarvon station. We'll be acquiring again in about one minute as we come back in range of the Honeysuckle station over in eastern Australia. During that pass over Carnarvon, you heard Donn Eisele comment with the flight controllers on the ground pertaining to the use of the sextant for star count and the ground advised that they would like to do another sextant star count at a different side angle. We also heard reference to recycling of the upper two oxygen cryogenic tank fans. This is a procedure that apparently is working quite well in preventing momentary overvoltages on the AC busses. We also heard their problem. Walt Cunningham for the first time since he began his sleep cycle, over 8 hours ago, still haven't heard from commander Wally Schirra at this point, and Cunningham advised that the partial pressure of oxygen in the cabin is now up to 245 mm of mercury. That is well above the partial pressure or oxygen content that we have here at sea level. So that enrichment process of the cabin atmosphere is continuing and will continue throughout the mission, probably never reaching pure O2 in the cabin. We would expect to have a small amount of nitrogen left in the cabin at reentry. We will stand by now as the spacecraft moves to within range of Honeysuckle and we should be reacquiring again in just a few seconds from now.
HONEYSUCKLE (REV 89)
140:47:10 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. You can close batt relay bus batt A circuit breaker now. [Pause]
140:47:17 Schirra: Good morning, Jack.
140:47:19 Swigert: Good morning, Wally. How are you this morning?
140:47:21 Schirra: Pretty good. Did we just go over Penny's home town? [Pause]
140:47:25 Swigert: Kind of looks that way.
140:47:27 Schirra: Yes, it was up loud and clear; sitting there it was very pretty. [Pause]
140:47:31 Swigert: Roger. Did you copy the closure of batt relay batt bus A circuit breaker? [Pause]
140:47:35 Schirra: Yes, Walt's doing it now.
140:47:36 Swigert: Okay. Real fine.
140:47:39 Schirra: We could see Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra; they really stood out clear as a bell in COAS over here. [Pause]
140:47:45 Swigert: Roger.
140:47:46 Cunningham: At dark. [Pause]
140:47:52 Schirra: We can even see the Southern Cross at this time, so Penny can feel pretty good about the flag up in her office. [Pause]
140:47:58 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
140:48:43 Cunningham: Jack, do you have a map update handy?
140:48:46 Swigert: They are in work. [Long pause]
140:49:08 Swigert: Okay. Walt, here is your map update. [Pause]
140:49:12 Cunningham (onboard): Any time.
140:49:14 Cunningham: Standing by.
140:49:15 Swigert: Okay. For REV 89, a GET of the node is 141 03 55, longitude 146.7 degrees west. We are pretty close to LOS Honeysuckle; pick you up at the Huntsville at -
Very long comm break.
140:49:38 Cunningham (onboard): Roger.
140:49:45 Cunningham (onboard): This is P52, option 2. Gyro-torquing angles, minus 00080, plus 00692, minus 01378. This is a torque align to a nominal REFSMMAT - that's the fine align, Jack. That time is 140 hours, 50 minutes.
140:50:14 Cunningham (onboard): Right. This is torque align, and these are the angles needed to torque it in for a fine align.
Evidently the spacecraft has passed out of range of the Honeysuckle station. You heard CapCom Jack Swigert advise the crew that we will be reacquiring over the tracking ship Huntsville in about 18 minutes. The spacecraft will continue to pass on up across the Pacific and on over the Guaymas, Mexico tracking station. We are scheduled to acquire at Texas, the Corpus Christi station, at 141 hours, 12 minutes ground elapsed time for that television pass over the United States this morning. That will be about 7:15 am Houston time. At 140 hours, 51 minutes into the mission, this is Apollo Control.
140:53:34 Cunningham (onboard): This is a P52 again. This is option 3 with the REFSMMAT alignment. The one we did just a minute ago. The time is 140 hours, 52 minutes. This time, the angles are 00008, 00002, and minus 00012.
This is Apollo Control at 141 hours, 8 minutes into the mission. The Apollo 7 spacecraft at the present time is coming up south of the tracking ship Huntsville in the western Pacific. We should be acquiring there shortly. We've just shown that we do have acquisition and we expect a call to go in to the crew from CapCom John Swigert momentarily. Coming up on our stateside pass with the television transmission this morning, and we anticipate we will be acquiring at the Texas station, Corpus Christi, Texas, about 3 or 4 minutes from now. We'll stand by now for the CapCom to put in a call to the crew over Huntsville.
We have been advised that the converter from the Texas site, the one that gave us a little trouble yesterday, appears to be working well this morning. We're getting a signal from the station, a test pattern on our screens, we just now put in a call to the crew. We'll pick up conversations from the Huntsville.
HUNTSVILLE (REV 89)
141:09:46 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through the Huntsville.
Comm break.
We have just gone out of range of the Huntsville, we'll be reacquiring at Guaymas, Mexico shortly. The spacecraft ground track on this pass over the southern part of the North American continent will actually take us down below Baja, California, and out on across the central part of Mexico. We'll cross over about a third of the way down into the Gulf of Mexico and continue on across the Gulf and out over the upper part of the Florida peninsula into the Atlantic. Here is the call now to the crew through Guaymas.
GUAYMAS through BERMUDA (REV 89)
141:11:59 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Guaymas.
141:12:02 Schirra: Roger. Loud and clear, Jack. [Pause]
141:12:07 Swigert: You're loud and clear. Could I verify that the O2 tank 2 fans are OFF now? [Pause]
141:12:13 Schirra: We'll cheek it. [Pause]
141:12:23 Cunningham: Give us a call, Jack, when you pick up the picture, will you?
141:12:26 Swigert: Will do, Walt; and what we would like to do is get an open circuit check on battery B now, and while we're going across the States now here, could we put the DC indicator switch at MAIN A or MAIN B and then pull the batt relay bus batt B circuit breaker? [Long pause]
141:13:13 Cunningham: I pulled the circuit breaker in battery bus B batt relay bus. [Pause]
141:13:17 Swigert: Okay. Fine, Walt. We'll give it about 10 minutes, and I'll ask you to close it. [Pause]
141:13:22 Cunningham: Okay.
The crew aboard Apollo 7 at the present time carrying out some last minute functions before we begin this television pass. They should have the TV camera on and warming up at the present time. Now we're just a little over a minute from acquisition at the Texas site and first resumption of those television pictures.
And we are starting to get the first flickering of the picture. It fades in, and we have the picture dropping out again. There we have a good solid picture.
141:14:19 Swigert: We've got the picture now, Walt. [Pause]
141:14:23 Schirra: Roger. Good morning. We are with you today while passing over the States to give you our daily ritual. [Long pause]
141:14:35 Schirra: Walt, would you please go over and dolly up the camera? I wonder what time it is. [Long pause]
141:14:50 Cunningham: I'll call up the computer clock time and take a look. [Pause]
141:14:56 Swigert: Okay. The picture isn't the best right at this time, Wally. [Pause]
141:15:00 Schirra: This is where we stand, and you'll note it's just about the time or below time - I'm not sure which way you look at it - but we have our situation completely solved. We now know what our orientation is. Now, if you'll pass me the camera, I'll continue the tour of the cockpit for the good people. [Long pause]
141:15:25 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni.
We're going to switch antennas here to try and improve the picture a little bit.
141:15:33 Schirra: We are showing the camera now in ALC OUT. That is a new picture of the camera crew today. They're looking into the commander's seat over to the numer 1 window. And you see the Sun just starting to come into the window, and it gives out a bright glare and you may notice there is some of the collection of deposit on the window as I zoom slowly. This window has given us some trouble in that it is near our dump system, and it cought quite a bit of debris on it. Next to the window is the optical site that we use for accurate alignment through the window. We come over to the number 2 window with the markings on it. These markings are used to orient the spacecraft if we have no other guidance system available, and it gives us the pitch angle in relation to the visible horizon of the Earth. And it has numbers such as 05, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and a line at the top which is our retro attitude, the attitude we're in to decelerate the spacecraft out of Earth orbit. Coming over to the center, or the hatch window, we have some lines that were added to it to give us attitude reference for reentry. The lines describe a 55-degree bank to the left, a 55-degree bank to the right, and two 90-degree banks either left or right.
141:17:18 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. That's a good picture of the hatch window. We can clearly see the lines. [Long pause]
141:17:58 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
141:18:07 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We're losing your voice description. [Long pause]
141:18:33 Schirra: Okay. Walt, why don't you take the camera back, and you can show us the overhead section above the couches. [Pause]
141:18:39 Swigert: Okay. Wally, we've got your voice back now. [Pause]
141:18:43 Schirra: Roger.
141:18:44 Cunningham: How's the picture, Jack?
141:18:45 Swigert: The picture is very good, very good.
141:18:47 Schirra: What I had shown you there were the two windows, the commander's reference windoww for pitch attitude and the center hatch window for bank attitude for reentry if we lose other guidance systems. [Long pause]
141:18:59 Swigert: Roger. We copy the center window. [Long pause]
141:19:22 Cunningham: For the LMP, this is where he sleeps. It's also where the command module pilot sleeps during his sleep cycle. Under the couch, we can see that there is absolutely no space left available. We have a suit stowage bag which is now stuffed completely full with three suits. These suits came off about 6 hours into the flight, and we've been very comfortable ever since. Passing back to the commander, he will describe the other couch for us.
GUAYMAS through BERMUDA (REV 90)
141:20:01 Schirra: This area here is the area under the command pilot couch, and we're showing the stowage of some of our loose equipment. The large long bag is the temporary stowage bag. At the far end is the helmets bag where we have our helmets stowed for the duration of the flight till we don our suits at the end. And at this point, Donn is frisking a sleep station bag. It looks like a normal camper's sleeping bag as it comes toward the lens. [Long pause]
141:20:36 Cunningham: That is affixed to the overhead structure that you see now ... [Pause]
141:20:43 Swigert: Apollo 7, opposite omni.
141:20:44 Schirra: ... is a spring system to secure it. [Pause]
141:20:51 Schirra: When this is properly secured, we have the sleeping bags restrained, and we, in essence, are not in contact with any area of the spacecraft but the bag itself. [Long pause]
141:21:10 Schirra: Donn Eisele's had a rather hard day, so we'll let him turn in early and give you an idea of what the sleep station looks like with one of the crew in it. [Long pause]
141:21:23 Cunningham: One of the things to get used to up here was sleeping in a position when you are completely free floating. [Long pause]
141:21:42 Schirra: At this particular point, you can see some of the sunlight coming in. We find that when we get as tired as we are at the end of the day here, we will cover our heads with the sleeping bag material, and the sunlight does not affect us. [Long pause]
141:22:00 Schirra: Houston, are you still reading?
141:22:02 Swigert: Roger. Five-by, Wally. [Pause]
141:22:08 Cunningham: At the far end of the stowage above the couches here, we have the helmet bags stowed for the commander on his side, and the lunar module pilot on his side, in the temporary stowage bag. You are looking here at two of the six umbilical hoses runnig from the environmental control system to the suits when the suits are on and to provide circulation when the suits are off. The hose on your right is the cold air hose bringing cold air into the suit, and the one with the screen - on your left - is the return hose from the suit. It is used also to clean the air with that screen when it's off the suit.
And we appear to be having trouble maintaining a good lock on this picture now as we've gone out of range of the Corpus Christi station, and over the station at Mila, the CapCom Jack Swigert, has now asked the crew to change antennas and they were back again with pictures.
141:23:09 Swigert: Roger. Walt, we've lost the picture now. [Pause]
141:23:14 Cunningham: Roger.
141:23:16 Swigert: You want to try opposite omni?
141:23:18 Cunningham: Okay. No more picture? [Pause]
141:23:24 Swigert: It's coming back.
141:23:25 Cunningham: Okay. We have the Hasselblad camera being held by Wally Schirra now. Whoops, he let go of it. Did yon see that, Jack? [Long pause]
141:23:40 Swigert: Roger. We copied that. [Long pause]
141:23:51 Swigert: A real good demonstration of zero g. [Pause]
141:23:58 Cunningham: And we might add for everybody's benefit, coming up later on in these flights, that there should be absolutely no problems with getting around in zero g as long as you're out of those suits. The work done is also zero, and you can move any place you want to very freely, and you certainly don't need strong handholds to take care of it. And you can generally jam your feet - you find you end up using your feet an awful lot more than you do in 1 g, kind of like a monkey moving around in the cage. He just took our picture. How's it going, Jack? [Long pause]
141:24:36 Swigert: It's going real fine. We're kind of locked up an a midframe here, but we're getting a good recording of this. [Long pause]
141:24:49 Cunningham: Okay. Here is a pencil demostration. Notice how Wally can coutrol that pen just with his breath. He could blow on me and probably do the same thing. [Long pause]
141:25:16 Swigert: Roger. Saw that, Wally. [Pause]
141:25:20 Cunningham: Okay. We have the 16 mm camera sitting back on the wall there just above my head. [Long pause]
141:25:32 Schirra: This camera, too, has the wide-angle lens, end we'll have some color movies of some of our home activities, as we've already labeled the movies, naturally, our home movies. [Long pause]
141:25:49 Swigert: We're just about to lose it now, Wally.
141:25:51 Schirra: Roger. And we do remember to remove the lens cap, as I just did.
141:25:54 Swigert: Roger.
141:25:56 Cunningham: And when we take pictures out the window, we always focus at infinity. [Pause]
141:26:02 Swigert: Roger. We've lost the picture now. Could we get you to close that batt relay bus batt B circuit breaker?
And we appear to have gone out of range as you heard CapCom Jack Swigert advise the crew. We had a very good picture early in that pass from Texas, and also excellent communications from the spacecraft on across the United States. We appear to have some problems with the scan converter at the Mila site, and we would anticipate that we got quite good recordings of that transmission, although the live play back left something to be desired with a little bit of trouble getting the frame rate properly centered. We'll continue now to monitor the crew conversations as they continue out on over the western Atlantic toward the northern part of Africa.
141:26:10 Cunningham: Roger. It's in work.
141:26:13 Cunningham: TV camera going off.
141:26:15 Swigert: Walt, why don't you leave that circuit breaker open through Canary, and we'll close it at Canary. [Pause]
141:26:19 Cunningham: You want to see it go closed? [Pause]
141:26:24 Cunningham: Okay.
141:26:25 Swigert: Leave the batt relay bus batt B circuit breaker open, and we'll close it just LOS Canary. [Pause]
141:26:30 Cunningham: Okay. TV camera going off.
141:26:32 Swigert: Roger.
141:26:33 Schirra: Jack, you understand how our arrow works now? [Pause]
141:26:38 Swigert: Say again, Wally.
141:26:40 Schirra: You understand how our UP arrow works now? We're not sure ourselves. [Pause]
141:26:50 Schirra: Did that arrow on the aft bulkhead show up?
141:26:53 Swigert: No, we didn't see the arrow on the afb bulkhead.
141:26:56 Schirra: Well, it blew the whole bit. [Pause]
141:27:00 Swigert: We could see the lines on the hatch window very clearly, but not the lines on the rendezvous window. [Pause]
141:27:08 Schirra: I see; very good. [Pause]
141:27:13 Schirra: We ... Did you see the debris on my number 1 window? [Pause]
141:27:17 Swigert: No, we couldn't make that out, and we lost your voice just about the time you were describing the - just after you started the description of the hatch window lines. [Long pause]
141:27:28 Schirra: I see. [Long pause]
141:28:15 Swigert: 7, we are 1 minute LOS Bermuda; Canaries at 141 plus 33.
141:28:22 Schirra: Roger.
Long comm break.
And this is Mission Control; we show that we have lost our acquisition with the spacecraft from Bermuda. We will be reacquiring in about 3 minutes from now over the Canary Islands. This is Apollo Control at 141 hours, 29 minutes.
This is Apollo Control at 141 hours, 35 minutes. The spacecraft has been acquired now over the Canary Island tracking station. The crew, at the present time, is scheduled to be involved in weather photography over the south Atlantic and on over the northern part of the African continent and we'll listen in now for the conversations between the crew and Mission Control Center.
CANARY (REV 90)
141:33:43 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through the Canaries. [Pause]
141:33:47 Schirra: Roger. Loud and clear.
141:33:50 Swigert: Roger. I have some targets of opportunity that you can add to your synoptic training photography list. [Long pause]
141:34:04 Schirra: Okay. Jack, you want to give it to me by time; is that what you're, going to do? [Pause]
141:34:09 Swigert: Stand by one, Wally; we've got a loud tone here. [Pause]
141:34:16 Schirra: Tell him he can take the day off. [Pause]
141:34:24 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Are you reading now? [Pause]
141:34:28 Schirra: We read you loud and clear.
141:34:29 Swigert: Okay. We had a loud tone there which cleared itself up. There are five targets of opportunity which you can add to your training photography. [Long pause]
141:34:41 Schirra: Okay. How are you blocking those, by time? [Pause]
141:34:45 Swigert: No. We're just giving you the targets, and then just letting you use your own judgement - fuel wise and everything - to photograph them when you come over. [Long pause]
141:34:57 Schirra: Right. If you can give me a time hack, I can put them on the flight plan; it's faster. [Pause]
141:35:02 Swigert: okay. Stand by. [Long pause]
141:35:16 Swigert: Wally, we may not get back to you with the GET of all five targets before Canaries then. We'll pick you up at Tananarive at - [Pause]
141:35:24 Schirra: - Just give me the targets; we'll straighten it out later.
141:35:26 Swigert: Okay. We have Tananarive at 141 plus 52. [Pause]
141:35:32 Schirra: Okay. [Long pause]
141:35:45 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
141:35:47 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
141:35:48 Schirra: Roger. Give me the five targets, and we can go ahead and look them up ourselves.
141:35:51 Swigert: Okay. [Pause]
141:36:00 Swigert: Okay. Wally, number 1 is the volcano in the Galapagos Islands. [Pause]
141:36:06 Schirra: Galapagos. Okay.
141:36:08 Swigert: Number 2 is the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii. [Pause]
141:36:17 Swigert: And number 3 is the Taal volcano in Luzon, in the Philippine Islands. [Pause]
141:36:25 Schirra: Okay. I got that.
141:36:28 Swigert: Amd number 4 is Mt. Areno in Costa Rica, and the lat is 9 degrees north, longitude 84 degrees west. [Long pause]
141:36:44 Schirra: Standing by for nine north, 84 west. Roger.
141:36:46 Swigert: And number 5 is Fort Bliss area in El Paso. [Pause]
141:36:56 Schirra: Roger. I think we got up to there yesterday. [Pause]
141:37:00 Swigert: Okay. And the number 3 - the Tasl volcano in the Philippines - the lat is 14 degrees north, longitude 120 degrees east. [Long pause]
141:37:11 Schirra: One hundred and twenty. Roger. Okay. We're going to do that area today and do landmarks and all of that good stuff, so we may have a chance to rack in a little. [Long pause]
141:37:28 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
141:37:34 Swigert: And, Wally. we've got a sixth one they just handed me: Africa, between 10 degrees north, 25 degrees east to 15 degrees north, 25 degrees east. [Long pause]
141:37:49 Schirra: Okay. [Pause]
141:37:56 Schirra: We've been hitting Africa pretty hard because that comes up, as you can see right now, in the daylight. [Pause]
141:38:00 Swigert: Okay. Fine. Could we get that batt relay bus batt B circuit breaker closed now? [Pause]
141:38:10 Cunningham: Done.
141:38:11 Schirra: Jack, what would help us is, if you can give us a lead in on this camera 15 to 20 minutes, we can pulse a little bit to stay near them. [Long pause]
141:38:23 Swigert: Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Mission Control, we have had LOS from the spacecraft over the Canary Islands. Spacecraft now passing over the northern part of the African continent and we will continue on down across Central Africa and out across the Madagascar Republic where we will acquire at the Tananarive station. Present - this is Mission Control at 141 hours, 40 minutes into the flight."
141:50:27 Schirra (onboard): 141:50:20; we took frame 124 on magazine F.
141:50:37 Eisele (onboard): Lake Chad.
141:50:47 Eisele (onboard): Lake Chad.
This is Apollo Control at 141 hours, 54 minutes, coming up on Tananarive and we will listen for the conversation with the crew.

Long comm break.
This is Mission Control. Apollo 7 is now out of range of the Tananarive tracking station and we will acquire the spacecraft next as it goes over Carnarvon. During this rev, the Apollo 7 crew will be searching out a number of targets of opportunity for their synoptic weather and terrain photography, including volcanoes in the Hawaiian Islands and the Philippines. At 141 hours, 59 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
142:04:35 Cunningham (onboard): 142 hours and 4 minutes into the flight; we have another failed food bag. This time it was fruit cocktail, and it was what you would call a failed safe mode. The tube which brings - is supposed to get the food out of the bag is sealed completely at the bottom for about a quarter of an inch width. But where there is a will there is a way, and I will find a way to eat this fruit cocktail.
142:05:05 Eisele (onboard): Speaking of failures, at 135 hours, one of the elements in the left-hand floodlight of the LEB failed, so the configuration now is position 2. You can have either fixed or dimmable, and on position 1 you have nothing, so both number 1 elements are out down in the LEB.
CARNARVON (REV 90)

142:10:21 Schirra: Roger. Standing by.
142:10:23 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
This is Apollo Control at 142 hours, 11 minutes. Our CapCom Jack Swigert has just put a call into the crew over Carnarvon and we'll pick up the conversation.
142:10:31 Cunningham: How'd the show go over this morning?
142:10:34 Swigert: Oh, the - we were locked on a midframe for about - oh, two-thirds of the way, or half the way through, and we've got it on tape, and we are trying to replay it - to where it's not locked on a midframe. [Long pause]
142:10:57 Swigert: We lost voice just about the time Wally just started describing the middle hatch there, and to where you picked it up right after that. [Long pause]
142:11:12 Swigert: Walt, this landmark number 37: it's 78 miles north of ground track. [Pause]
142:11:22 Cunningham: Okay.
142:11:25 Swigert: And could we get the BIOMED switch to CDR? [Pause]
142:11:32 Schirra (onboard): Done.
142:11:43 Swigert: Apollo 7. Opposite omni.
Long comm break.
142:15:06 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Carnarvon. We pick up Honeysuckle here; do you want to turn your S-band volume up? [Pause]
142:15:15 Cunningham: Okay. [Long pause]
142:15:34 Cunningham: Jack, log the LMP 10 clicks of water on the water gun, will you, please?
142:15:37 Swigert: Roger. Will do.
Long comm break.
This is Mission Control. That appears to be about all we'll get from the crew over Carnarvon. We'll pick up again in a few minutes as the spacecraft comes into view of the HSK station.
HONEYSUCKLE (REV 90)
142:20:48 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. LOS Honeysuckle; Hawaii at 142 plus 35.
142:20:55 Schirra: Roger. Jack, we rode to the [garble] on that S-band. We're going to bring [garble].
Very long comm break.
142:20:58 Cunningham (onboard): ...big lock on it now.
142:22:08 Cunningham (onboard): I'll trade you four puddings for a package of bacon squares.
142:22:14 Schirra (onboard): One bacon square?
142:22:15 Cunningham (onboard): Half a pack? Four?
142:22:17 Schirra (onboard): No sale.
142:22:18 Cunningham (onboard): How about two beef bites for one bacon square? That's what I'll give you.
142:22:25 Schirra (onboard): You mean two small bites?
142:22:26 Cunningham (onboard): Two packages of beef bites for one single bacon square (laughter).
142:22:31 Schirra (onboard): I don't care for it. Thank you.
142:22:37 Eisele (onboard): That's like trading a dump - dump truck load of trash for a diamond
142:33:11 Eisele (onboard): We have an old gripe that we have not recorded. On the MDC MET, there is a crack in the glass in the upper right corner that passes over unit seconds and cuts into the middle of tens seconds.
HAWAII (REV 90)
142:36:06 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii.
This is Apollo Control at 142 hours, 37 minutes into the mission. We've acquired the spacecraft over Hawaii, and are in communication with the crew.
142:36:09 Schirra: Aloha.
142:36:12 Swigert: Roger. Wally, you're coming through loud and clear. [Pause]
142:36:17 Schirra: Good. [Pause]
142:36:25 Eisele (onboard): Hey, Jack, this is Donn. Log me 20 clicks on the water gun, will you?
142:36:39 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7.
142:36:41 Swigert: Go ahead.
142:36:42 Eisele: Log the CMP 20 clicks on the water gun.
142:36:45 Swigert: Will do. Hey, Donn, on this second landmark: this is going to be a fairly difficult one to acquire. You'll probably have to roll up about 30 degrees right to pick it up, and there's some cloud cover up there. We're saying near seven-tenths. If you do have any problems getting it, go ahead and acquire an unknown landmark and track that. [Long pause]
142:37:10 Eisele: You say the second one; that's Tyndall Air Base, right?
142:37:13 Swigert: Yes, sir. [Long pause]
142:37:31 Eisele: Hey, Jack, it's very likely we won't get it, and this would be a good checkout of the unknown landmark. Up to here, I've already done a couple of these. [Pause]
142:37:39 Swigert: Okay. Understand.
Long comm break.
This is Mission Control; we'll have a brief dropout in communications here as the spacecraft crosses between acquisition at Hawaii, and is picked up again by the Tracking Ship Huntsville. We'll stand by.
We have had no conversation from the crew yet over Huntsville; we will have a pretty solid contact with the spacecraft now on across this Stateside pass. At the present time, the spacecraft is in an orbit 155 miles at his high point, with a perigee, or a low point, of just about 90 nautical miles. Now the orbital weight of the vehicle is 29 580 pounds at the present time.
HUNTSVILLE through ANTIGUA (REV 90)
142:43:05 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
142:43:15 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
142:43:59 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
142:44:03 Schirra: Loud and clear.
142:44:05 Swigert: Roger. We have a small correction to the location of lanadmark 37, the second landmark. [Pause]
142:44:15 Eisele: Go ahead.
142:44:16 Swigert: Okay. That's 78 miles south - south of ground track, which means you are going to have to roll that - [Long pause]
142:44:27 Eisele: - what do you mean small ... that's 150 miles.
142:44:29 Swigert: That's small - which means you are going to have to roll left, Donn, to get it. [Long pause]
142:44:42 Swigert: I'm sorry about that.
142:44:45 Eisele: That's no sweat.
Long comm break.
142:48:17 Eisele: Four marks in so far. [Pause]
142:48:21 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
142:48:25 Schirra: We've got five marks in that first landmark.
142:48:27 Swigert: Okay. Real fine, real fine. We have a - when we changed that 78 miles from north to south, that is going to change our shaft that you should be reading. Your shaft for the second lanmark will be 049 degrees, same trunnion. [Long pause]
142:48:45 Schirra: Roger.
142:48:46 Eisele: Roger.
Comm break.
HUNTSVILLE through ANTIGUA (REV 91)
142:50:12 Eisele: Here come the updates. Are you reading these, Jack? [Pause]
142:50:18 Swigert: Affirmative, Donn. We are copying them.
142:50:21 Eisele: Okay. I'll just go through them, then. [Long pause]
142:50:37 Schirra: Earth state vector is good at all marks or better. [Pause]
142:50:42 Eisele: Or else it's not working.
142:50:43 Swigert: Roger. Copy that.
142:50:45 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause]
142:51:09 Schirra: Boy, you can really tell who is burning fires down there today. [Pause]
142:51:14 Swigert: Roger, Wally.
142:51:15 Schirra: There is one place - there is a smoke curl of about 160 miles; it just obscures the whole area. [Pause]
142:51:23 Swigert: Copy that.
142:51:24 Schirra: The pollution boys ought to get up here one time. [Long pause]
142:51:43 Eisele: At 142 hours, 51 minutes 34 seconds, Wally took a picture of the city with the large smoke - large smoke trail off of it. Magazine S, Frame [garble] zero. [Pause]
142:51:53 Swigert: Copy.
142:51:56 Schirra: Starting to roll left. [Pause]
142:52:01 Cunningham: Here is a target location update. [Long pause]
142:52:15 Eisele: What do you know, that point is under water. [Long pause]
142:52:41 Eisele: Jack, what is that trunnion angle and shaft angle for this target that I'm shooting?
142:52:44 Swigert: The trunnions is goin to be 049, and the shaft is going to be 03 - rather the shaft is going to be 049, trunnion 030. [Long pause]
142:53:01 Eisele: Okay. That's with the roll angle in? [Pause]
142:53:09 Swigert: Negative. That is not with the roll angle in.
142:53:11 Eisele: Okay. So we can subtract the roll angle little there somewhat? [Pause]
142:53:16 Swigert: Affirmative. [Long pause]
142:53:27 Eisele: Magazine S, pictures 127 to 130 were taken of Houston, and the area north of Dallas, and Dallas. [Pause]
142:53:35 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
142:53:41 Schirra: We are socked in right off the Gulf Coast. [Long pause]
142:53:55 Schirra: There is a hole - we might see Tyndall, but it's pretty poor picking. [Pause]
142:53:59 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
142:54:15 Schirra: Jack, whereabouts is Gladys this morning? [Pause]
142:54:20 Swigert: Stand by. I'll get you lat/long. [Pause]
142:54:28 Swigert: Wally, it looks like it's just generally west of Fort Meyers. [Pause]
142:54:32 Schirra: Yes. Walt has it right now. It's to the south of us. [Pause]
142:54:38 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
142:54:47 Eisele: Jack, next pass, if we don't have a landmark right around this same area, we can get a beautifull picture of that hurricane. [Pause]
142:54:53 Swigert: Okay. Sounds good. [Pause]
142:54:57 Schirra: The weather is too bad to see Tyndall. [Long pause]
142:55:30 Eisele: Hey, Jack.
142:55:32 Swigert: Go ahead. [Pause]
142:55:37 Eisele: Apollo 7, Houston. Apollo 7. [Pause]
142:55:41 Swigert: Roger. Go ahead.
142:55:43 Eisele: Roger. Jack, that isn't enough time between landmarks.
142:55:45 Swigert: Roger -
142:55:46 Eisele: I have to get my book to the next landmark, and checklist squared away, and load in new data, plus accept all the results of the first one. You just can't get it all done in 7 minutes. [Pause]
142:55:56 Swigert: Okay. I copy that, Donn.
142:55:58 Eisele: I didn't get an unknown mark either because it was just too late getting on the scope. [Pause]
142:56:04 Schirra: We're trying to find out - and we - the best place to get practice landmarks is right here, JT. [Pause]
142:56:11 Swigert: Understand.
142:56:12 Schirra: OJT.
142:56:14 Swigert: Roger. Understand.
142:56:17 Schirra: You understand we never did get landmark trainlng with our simulator; it did not work.
142:56:20 Swigert: Roger. I knew that.
Comm break.
142:58:54 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7.
142:58:57 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Go. [Pause]
142:59:02 Schirra: Roger. When I transmit the pulse to SELF COMMAND, it's much more difficult than it is in the simulator. I have to move the switch very rapidly to avoid a RATE COMMAND pulse. [Pause]
142:59:12 Swigert: Roger. Copy that. And, Wally...
142:59:15 Schirra: That's the only anomaly I've seen in the system, other than the fact that the pulses are much smaller than they are in the simulator. [Pause]
142:59:22 Swigert: Okay. Copy that. We do have the information the first landmark for that next P22 during the next rev, if you're ready to copy. [Long pause]
142:59:39 Schirra: I think he's using the hook, Jack. You will have to hold.
142:59:41 Swigert: Okay. [Pause]
142:59:45 Schirra: Wait a minute; here he comes. Go ahead.
142:59:47 Swigert: Okay. This will be landmark 18. It's north of ground track, 28 miles north. The GET is 142 plus 23. You'll have a shaft of 343 and a trunnion of 31. [Long pause]
143:00:20 Eisele: The 144 23 was the GET of landmark. Right? [Pause]
143:00:24 Swigert: Affirmative.
143:00:25 Eisele: How about landmark number, and give me the distance again?
143:00:28 Swigert: Okay. It's landmark 18, 28 miles north of ground track. [Long pause]
143:00:39 Eisele: Landmark 18, 28 miles north, 144 plus 23, shaft rate 343, trunnion 31. [Pause]
143:00:45 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
143:00:57 Swigert: We're trying to find a second one for you that gives you enough time in between sightings, an if not, we'll give you - let you have an unknown landmark exercise. [Long pause]
143:01:08 Eisele: Okay. [Long pause]
143:01:42 Swigert: And, Donn, on our second landmark for this next rev, we can't find a suitable landmark that is clear at that time. [Long pause]
143:01:53 Swigert: So it's an unknow landmark exercise; it's your day. [Pause]
143:01:58 Cunningham: Okay. Fine. If there are too many clouds, I'll just use a cloud bank. [Long pause]
143:02:21 Swigert: Real fine.
Very long comm break.
This is Mission Control at 143 hours, 4 minutes. We have completed that stateside pass now, and have lost acquisition with the station at Antigua. The next station to acquire will be the Tananarive station. The spacecraft will pass north of Ascension. We don't anticipate any conversation with the crew over Ascension. This is Apollo Control at 143 hours, 4 minutes.
143:10:00 Schirra (onboard): Frame 131, magazine zero, is of F-O-G-O Island in the Cape Verde group islands. Mark time 143:10 - 143, 09 minutes.
143:10:49 Eisele (onboard): Time, 143 hours, 10 minutes; just completed the third landmark of the first pass, Fogo Island, the volcano. I got five marks on it. First update of the first mark is 00000, 00000; second update, first mark is 00000, 00000.
143:11:28 Eisele (onboard): First update, second mark is 00000, 00000.
This is Apollo Control at 143 hours, 27 minutes. At the present time the Apollo 7 spacecraft is coming up on the Tananarive Tracking Station. Flight plan calls for the crew to be involved in photographing the southwest coast of Africa at the present time; and we have a call in to the spacecraft.
TANANARIVE (REV 91)
143:27:16 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
143:27:20 Unidentifiable crewmember: Roger. Loud and clear.
143:27:22 Swigert: Roger. You're loud and clear also. How are the results of that third landmark, Donn? [Pause]
143:27:28 Eisele: I got five marks on it and all the updates to the state vector Z coordinates, and it is now corrected at the landmark. I think it's rather significant for the computer to take [garble]. [Long pause]
143:27:48 Eisele (onboard): ... to assume its own state vector's perfect, and that the landmark is in the wrong place.
143:28:04 Swigert: Donn, you started out real good, and then you faded out; we'll catch you over Carnarvon on that report. We copied that the update to the state vector were all zips.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. We are having some difficulty getting good communications with the spacecraft during this pass over Tananarive. We'll stand by and pick up the loop again if any conversations develop.
143:28:15 Eisele (onboard): That's affirmative. I'll talk to you later.
143:31:58 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston.
143:32:00 Communications Technician: Roger [Pause]
143:32:04 Swigert: Roger. We're about 1 minute LOS Tananarive. We'll have ARIA on S-band at 143 plus 38 and Carnarvon about 4 minutes later. [Long pause]

143:38:16 Swigert: Loud and clear, Donn.
143:38:19 Schirra (onboard): Roger.
143:38:29 Schirra (onboard): Jack, what's the predicted path of Gladys at this time?
143:38:32 Schirra: We have this band of data to be done. [Pause]
143:38:39 Swigert: Say again, Donn.
143:38:41 Schirra: This is Wally. What's the predicted path for Gladys? [Pause]
143:38:46 Swigert: Okay. Stand by. I'll have you a real good hack on that as we come up through Carnarvon here. [Pause]
143:38:53 Schirra: okay.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo control at 143 hours, 43 minutes. We're standing by now to pick up the spacecraft over the Carnarvon, Australia tracking station. We've just put in a call to the crew.
CARNARVON (REV 91)
143:42:53 Swigert: Apollo 7. Houston.
143:42:55 Unidentifiable crewmember: Loud and clear. [Pause]
143:42:59 Swigert: Roger. I have a couple of questions for Walt here. [Pause]
143:43:04 Cunningham: I'm listening.
143:43:06 Swigert: Okay. The gurgling sound that we heard yesterday, Walt, when we were on AUTO 1 then: did you hear the same gurgling sound in AUTO 2? [Long pause]
143:43:20 Cunningham: It's come back at several different times, and It's also gone away. It seems to be associated with higher humidity time. AUTO 1 and AUTO 2 are both working on the cyclic accumulators. [Long pause]
143:43:31 Swigert: Okay. Fine.
143:43:34 Schirra: We have a theory, Jack, that where we provide g on a burn, we start disturbing water that may be in the lines and get it started out of the pipes. [Long pause]
143:43:45 Swigert: Okay. Copy that. You are still stroking mannually a little bit, too? [Pause]
143:43:54 Cunningham: Yes, we hit it a couple of times. I'm not sure that had anything to do with clearing it up or anything. It seems to me it kind of runs its course, and it's occurred after burns every time. [Pause]
143:44:03 Swigert: Okay. And then we had some garbled transmissions. We didn't get too much of the transmission when you reported a leak yesterday at the water panel. Did this occur when you were dumping waste water? [Long pause]
143:44:20 Cunningham: Every time we've dumped waste water, the place where the PUD attaches to the waste water panel is a - what do you call it - a suaged fitting, and there is no O-ring in it, and we tightened it up, and it leaked. I tightened it up again as much as I think we ought to on that small line with the wrench we have, and it still forms a big bubble every time you dump. You get a - oh, 4 or 5 ounces of water in the one big bubble right there on the waste water panel after you've finished dumping a waste water tank. [Long pause]
143:44:52 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
143:44:54 Schirra: Just to make the point clear, Jack, that same fitting is used as a GSE fitting on the spacecraft prep period at the Cape, and they used a voishant washer in there, but we can't do it that way. They're going to redesign that fitting for later flights or put a solid mount in. [Long pause]
143:45:14 Swigert: Okay. Real fine. Real good description here. And the other thing is I have - we've got another landmark on this next pass that is - allows you to do some unknown landmark tracking in between. We'd like to pass you some data on a second landmark for this next pass. [Long pause]
143:45:34 Cunningham: Okay. Go ahead. [Pause]
143:45:39 Schirra: Jack, on this next pass, we'd like to make a run on that hurricane instead of an unknown. We can get unknowns all around the world. [Pause]
143:45:45 Swigert: Okay. We concur on that, Wally. We'd like for you to send up a state vector here at Carnarvon. Could you go to ACCEPT? [Long pause]
143:46:10 Schirra: You've got it.
143:46:11 Swigert: Okay. Coming up.
143:46:14 Swigert: Okay. This landmark is number 225. It's 68 miles south of ground track. [Long pause]
143:46:26 Schirra: Hold it; hold it. Donn's doing another thing here. [Pause]
143:46:31 Schirra: All right. Start again, Jack. I'm sorry.
143:46:33 Swigert: 0kay. Landmark 225, 68 miles south of ground track, GET 144 plus 56, shaft 037, trunnion 033. [Long pause]
143:47:02 Schirra: Okay. Lanamark 225, 68 miles south, 144:56 the time, 037 033 shaft and trunnion. [Long pause]
143:47:13 Swigert: Okay. This will be a real marginal landmark since it's quite close to the terminator there. [Long pause]
143:47:24 Schirra: Okay.
143:47:26 Swigert: Okay. And I'm ready with your NAV check PAD when you're ready to copy. [Pause]
143:47:31 Schirra: All right. Stand by.
143:47:32 Cunningham: Go.
143:47:34 Swigert: Okay. GET 143 47 0000 minus 26 13 plus 11802 1502. [Long pause]
143:48:00 Cunningham: Roger. 143 47 four balls minus 26 13 plus 11802 1502. [Pause]
143:48:09 Swigert: Roger. And we're through with the computer. [Long pause]
143:48:28 Swigert: And, Wally, would you like an update for the telescope for watching the hurricane, or do you intend to do that visually? [Long pause]
143:48:39 Schirra: Visually.
143:48:40 Swigert: Okay. Copy. [Long pause]
143:48:55 Swigert: Okay. Wally, the present position of the hurricane is about 100 miles due west of Tampa. [Long pause]
143:49:07 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause]
143:49:20 Swigert: I'll give you part of the news. The front page headlines this morning on the mission says, "Big Storm Tracked by Apollo 7" and describes the spacecraft as a manned weather satellite. [Long pause]
143:49:34 Eisele: The witch is out finally. [Pause]
143:49:38 Swigert: We're about 1 minute LOS Carnarvon; we'll pick you up at Hawaii at 144 plus 07. [Long pause]
143:49:51 Schrra: One day we're COMBAT, and nov we're NAV SAT.
143:49:54 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
143:50:00 Schirra: Our Navy boys - they're just worried about being UNSAT.
Very long comm break.
This is Mission Control. We've lost acquisition now at the Carnarvon station, and we'll be reacquiring the spacecraft again at Hawaii. During that pass you heard Wally Schirra describe a small leak that they encountered. As he described it, it was on the water panel during a dump of waste water. He said they get about 4 or 5 ounces of water which apparently comes out as one big bubble when the waste water is dumped. He said they had tightened the fitting in an effort to cut down the leakage, but they were still getting about 4 to 5 ounces in that bubble. This is Apollo Control at 143 hours, 52 minutes into the mission.
