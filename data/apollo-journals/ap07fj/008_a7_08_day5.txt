This is Apollo Control, Houston; 96 hours and 3 minutes into the flight, We are going to try to advise Apollo 7 that we are standing by here in a moment, but the circuit sounds noisey this morning through Tananarive. One comment on the television tape which you might have missed. In looking at the tape carefully, and this came up in a conversation the second time we looked at it here in the Control center, you begin to appreciate the true size of Apollo. Remember the internal volume is nearly 4 times that of Gemini. 320 cubic feet versus 80 odd for Gemini. And the pilots, as they presented their Q cards and so forth in the opening sequence, were coming to us, they were floating out of an area under the Command Module's seat. Donn Eisele was in the Commander's seat on the left side, and we saw Wally Schirra and then Walt Cunningham sort of staging from an area immediately under, that seat and floating up and then across our field of view. Then of course Wally pointed the camera dow n into the lower equipment bay and he did a wonderful explanation of the optics. Now we have reached Apollo 7; let's listen.
TANANARIVE (REV 61)
096:03:44 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
096:03:47 Schirra (onboard): Roger, you're very weak, Jack.
096:03:55 Schirra (onboard): Houston, we believe your - you still at Tananarive?
096:04:02 Schirra (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7.
096:04:15 Schirra (onboard): Houston, Apollo 7.
096:04:21 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive. Standing by.
096:04:24 Unidentifiable crewmember: Houston, Apollo 7. [Pause]
096:04:29 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7. Do you read?
096:04:30 Swigert: Read you five-by. We're staning by here.
096:04:33 Schirra: Roger. Think we better knock this run off here and calculate the amount of fuel usage. [Pause]
096:04:38 Schirra: We've got over 3 hours in the bank of this test which is a lot better [garble] expected. [Pause]
096:04:46 Swigert: Wally, we are not reading COMM very well through Tananarive here. [Pause]
096:04:54 Schirra: We are terminating this test. [Long pause]
096:05:18 Schirra: Houston, how do you read? Apollo 7. [Pause]
096:05:22 Swigert: Okay, Apollo 7.
096:05:25 Schirra: Roger. We've terminated the evaporator test. [Pause]
096:05:29 Swigert: Wally, we have been monitoring the fuel usage very closely. They find the fuel usage is nominal for this test. We would like to continue test and use the secondary evaporator if to lower the EVAP OUT temperature. [Long pause]
096:05:55 Swigert: COMM is very bad here over Tananarive; we will have a real good pass with you through Carnarvon. [Pause]
096:06:05 Cunningham: Roger. The primary evaporator is working fine again. [Pause]
096:06:11 Swigert: Okay. Copy that, Walt.
Long comm break.
096:10:22 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We're 1 minute LOS Tananarive. We'll pick up ARIA 1 in about 2 minutes. Monitor you there througgh Carnarvon. [Long pause]
096:10:33 Eisele: Roger. We'll continue with the transmit. [Pause]
096:10:37 Swigert: Roger. Copy. [Long pause]
096:10:51 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, this is Walt. Give me 30 clicks on the water gun in the last 3 hours. [Pause]
096:10:57 Swigert: How many clicks, Walt?
096:10:59 Cunningham: Thirty.
096:11:00 Swigert: Roger. Thirty clicks.
096:11:02 Cunningham: And CDR: 25.
096:11:05 Swigert: Twenty-five to CDR.
096:11:07 Eisele: Thirty for CMP.
096:11:10 Swigert: Thirty for CMP.
Long comm break.
ARIA 1 (REV 61)
096:14:11 Swigert: ARIA 1. Go remote. [Long pause]
096:14:59 Cunningham: Houston, Apollo 7. Stand by. [Long pause]
096:15:22 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA. [Long pause]
096:16:04 Swigert: Apollo 7. Houston through ARIA. Standing by.
Comm break.
096:18:38 Communications Technician: ARIA 1, AOS. You may lock. [Pause]
096:18:44 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA. [Long pause]
096:19:05 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through ARIA.
CARNARVON (REV 61)
096:19:50 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Carnarvon. [Pause]
096:19:57 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7. How do you read?
096:19:59 Swigert: You're reading - I'm reading you five-by, and I have your block data number 11 whenever you're ready to copy.
Apollo Control, Houston here at 96 hours, 20 minutes into the flight. We just acquired through Carnarvon and here is how the conversation is going.
096:20:09 Eisele: Roger. Stand by for the copy. Jack, on the Hasselblad magazines: now they have the modified slide in it, and it's possible to take pictures with the slide still in place on the back. I think we'd probably be better off with a safety on those. We just got through taking four pictures with the back in place and wasted ... [Long pause]
096:20:35 Schirra: Slide.
096:20:36 Eisele: ... slide in place, excuse me, and we wasted four shots there, and probably three or four other ones through the flight at random. [Pause]
096:20:45 Swigert: Okay. I copy that Walt. [Long pause]
096:21:27 Eisele: Jack, go ahead with your updates. [Pause]
096:21:32 Swigert: Roger. Block data 11: 063 dash 4 A plus 305 minus 1599 099 plus 36 plus 59 3402, 064 dash 4 A plus 309 minus 1600 101 plus 13 plus 24 3578, 065 dash 4 A plus 269 minus 1600 102 plus 46 plus 04 2888, 066 dash 3 A plus 309 plus 1363 104 plus 04 plus 38 3403 plus, 067 dash 3 A plus 306 plus 1362 105 plus 41 plus 04 3607, 068 dash 3 Baker plus 261 plus 1344 107 plus 13 plus 10 2888.
096:24:31 Eisele: Roger. That's complete, your block update, Jack? [Pause]
096:24:37 Swigert: Affirmative.
096:24:39 Eisele: A readback as follows. Did you start with 62 or 63? [Pause]
096:24:49 Swigert: 063 dash 4 A.
096:24:52 Eisele: You're 063 dash 4 A plus 305 minus 1599 099 3659 3402, 064 dash 4 A plus 309 mius 1600 101 13 24 3578, 065 dash 4 A plus 269 minus 1600 102 46 04 2888, 066 dash 3 Alpha plus 309 plus 1363 104 04 38 3403, 067 dash 3 Alpha plus 306 plus 1362 105 41 04 3607, 068 dash 3 Bravo plus 261 plus 1344 107 13 10 2888.
096:25:59 Swigert: Roger. That's correct. [Long pause]
096:26:23 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Did you purge O2? [Pause]
096:26:29 Eisele: I purged O2 at the regular scheduled time, which was several hours ago, I think. Wasn't it? [Pause]
096:26:35 Swigert: Roger. We copy.
096:26:37 Eisele: Check the time on that, will you, Jack?
096:26:40 Swigert: Roger. That should have been at 94 hours. [Pause]
096:26:44 Eisele: That's right; we purged at 94 hours.
096:26:47 Swigert: Okay.
096:26:49 Schirra: We're going through a meal now and probably have a gripe. The cracker-type food, chicken sandwiches: they are all crumbly, and we have a lot of problem with crumbs all over the cockpit. We have been rejecting a lot of this. [Long pause]
096:27:10 Swigert: Okay. Wally,we copy that. You are about 1 minute LOS Carnarvon, and we won't get you again till Hawaii at 96 plus 45. [Long pause]
096:27:26 Schirra: Roger.
Very long comm break.
Apollo Control, Houston. We are now 96 hours, 31 minutes into the flight and I think we are probably out of communications through the Australian circle, at least we are passing over the northeastern edge of the continent of Australia. Just before we came into Australia, you heard, if you were monitoring the release loop, some excellent commentary - communications letts say through the - one of the aircraft - one of the KC135 flying radio stations which we are exercising during this mission. The aircraft was flying at about 40,000 feet in the mid-Indian Ocean and the atmospherics must have been very cooperative today, because that is the clearest communications we've heard in the 4 or 5 days of this mission. Through an aircraft we could hear them and they said they could hear us quite well. At 96 hours, 32 minutes into our mission, we now will have an out until the spacecraft is acquired by Hawaii, which acquisition should come at 96 hours, 45 minutes. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
Apollo Control, Houston. We are 96 hours, 53 minutes into the flight. A few minutes ago, we called Apollo 7 through Hawaii and here is how the conversation has gone.
HAWAII through BERMUDA (REV 61)
096:45:30 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Hawaii. [Pause]
096:45:38 Eisele: We'we completed all data recording throug you. Are you, going to be dumping that tape now. [Long pause]
096:45:49 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We are going to revind the tape here. We will dump it over the States. [Pause]
096:45:56 Eisele: Roger, and can we secure this test? [Pause]
096:46:03 Schirra: Roger. We will continue for 30 more minutes.
096:46:06 Swigert: Okay. We are going to secure at 97 hours, Wally.
096:46:09 Schirra: Roger. [Long pause]
096:46:45 Schirra: Jack, this is Wally.
Comm break.
096:47:47 Swigert: Go ahead.
096:47:49 Schirra: This really a thrilling flight control task. One slow roll in an hour and a half. [Pause]
096:47:56 Swigert: (Laughter) Roger. Copy that.
Long comm break.
096:51:10 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
096:51:14 Eisele: Say again.
096:51:16 Swigert: Walt, I have this daylight scanning telescope star count PAD to give you whenever you are ready to copy. [Long pause]
096:52:01 Eisele: Okay. It's the the daylight scanning telescope star count or the sextant star count, Jack? [Long pause]
096:52:16 Schirra: Jack, how much fuel did we blow on that one that is impossible to use? [Long pause]
096:52:27 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7. [Pause]
096:52:31 Swigert: Wally, we will give you a hack on your fuel use on this - the fuel usage we have copied so far has been between 17 amd 18 pounds, which is in the nominal for this test.
Comm break.
096:53:49 Eisele: Jack, I'm ready to copy the update chart. [Long pause]
096:54:02 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7.
096:54:04 Swigert: Okay. Walt, stand by one. [Pause]
096:54:08 Schirra: Jack, on some of these [garble] let's assume we've learned something up here in 5 days that somebody else hasn't learaned yet. [Pause]
096:54:18 Swigert: Say again, Wally. I missed that.
096:54:21 Schirra: Let's assume we have learned something up here in the last 5 days that we didn't know before we came up. [Long pause]
096:54:35 Swigert: Okay. I have this daylight star count PAD to pass up. [Pause]
096:54:43 Schirra: Okay. We will take it.
096:54:45 Swigert: Okay. GET of sunrise 98 plus 15, roll 000, pitch 097, yaw 000. GET of sunset minus 12 98 plus 56, roll 000, pitch 327, yaw 000. Your T align will be 98 plus 15, and the only remark ... [Long pause]
096:55:38 Schirra: Do we have to do this T align for these angles? We have a REFSMVAT now. [Pause]
096:55:43 Swigert: Roger. The T align is for those angles, and the other chagne on this is that the shaft will be 90 degrees and a trunion of zero degrees. [Long pause]
096:56:02 Cunningham: Okay. Zero shaft 90. Donn has got something to report. [Pause]
096:56:10 Eisele: Jack, we did this test a couple of days ago with a 120-degrees angle up, and I just didn't see much point in it. Your ability to see stars is not so much the function of light transmission of the telescope as it is a matter of stray light you got coming in from loose particles flying around outside that look like stars and also in stray light that comes up from the Earth and whatnot, distorting the telescope picture. Jack, the point is that I don't think you are going to learn a lot from this. We know already that the stars aren't all the same [garble] adapter. [Long pause]
096:56:55 Swigert: Okay. Donn, we've got real poor COMM. I can't quite copy. Let's wait until we get over the coast, and we will have a little better COMM. [Pause]
096:57:03 Eisele: Roger. Copy.
Comm break.
097:00:01 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
097:00:05 Schirra: Go ahead.
097:00:06 Swigert: Roger. Appears to us that the evaporator might be drying out again. [Pause]
097:00:11 Schirra: Darn right. [Pause]
097:00:19 Schirra: Jack, I've been trying to tell you that with realignment we lose fuel, get into a new attitude, fly at two different attitudes to prove what we have already discovered in this flight: that you can't see stars in the telescope except jast after sunrise [garble] or just after [garble] sunset which we have been trying to tell the Project 0ffice for about 5 years. [Long pause]
097:00:42 Swigert: Roger. Copy that. Wally, this test here has the telescope sunlight of sight at 70 degrees, which is the worst case, and we would kind of like to get this one in. [Long pause]
097:00:56 Schirra: That's what I've been trying to tell you. With the best case, we didn't do any good. If you want us to do the test, all right; we will do it, but we are kind of tired of arguing whith peole who tell us to do this. I'm not talking about you, but the various things you don't know about telscopes. [Long pause]
097:01:27 Schirra: It's a quarter after 12:00, Cape time. [Pause]
097:01:37 Cunningham: Houston, is the radiator degradation test over yet? [Pause]
097:01:43 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. You can discontinue the raditor degradation test. [Pause]
097:01:49 Cunningham: Roger.
Comm break.
097:04:23 Cunningham: You appear wide open from here today. [Pause]
097:04:27 Swigert: Go ahead. Apollo 7.
097:04:28 Cunningham: Roger. You look like you are pretty wide open on weather today. [Pause]
097:04:32 Swigert: That's affirmative.
097:04:34 Cunningham: We remember last time. Over. [Long pause]
HAWAII through BERMUDA (REV 62)
097:05:18 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
097:05:26 Eisele: Go ahead, Jack.
097:05:28 Swigert: Donn, while you are taking photographs during either this stateside pass - or the next one if you can fit it in - we like to get a picture of Tucson and a picture of a tropical storm which is presently just south of Cuba. [Long pause]
097:05:51 Eisele: Understand. Tucscon and a storm south of Cuba. [Pause]
097:05:55 Swigert: Roger. Tropical storm Gladys just south of Cuba. [Pause]
097:05:59 Schirra: Which end, Jack? South of Haiti or south of the [garble]? [Long pause]
097:06:12 Schirra: If you could give us latitude and longitude, that would help us. [Pause]
097:06:16 Swigert: Stand by, wally. [Long pause]
097:06:30 Swigert: Okay. Wally, the present position of this storm is south of the eastern tip of Cuba and east - western tip of Cuba and east off Yucatan Peninsula. [Long pause]
097:06:43 Schirra: [Garble] up through the Cuban Islands? Okay. We got a pretty good fix on it. It will be on the next two passes, and we should get a cut of it. [Long pause]
097:07:02 Swigert: Next pass, it looks like you would be in a little better position; it looks like you might even pass right over it. [Long pause]
097:07:20 Eisele: Jack, this is Donn. Would you log me ten clicks on the water gun? [Pause]
097:07:25 Swigert: Roger. Copy that.
097:07:27 Eisele: Give Walt 15 clicks.
097:07:30 Swigert: Fifteen for Walt.
097:07:31 Eisele: And Schirra will take 20.
097:07:33 Swigert: Okay. [Long pause]
097:08:11 Swigert: Apollo 7, we show you are approaching Guaymas LOS. [Pause]
097:08:17 Schirra: That's what you call skirting the issue, just going by the edge.
097:08:20 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
097:08:33 Eisele: Jack, on that Tucson-Phoenix, did you want the Pan-X or the 121? [Pause]
097:08:40 Swigert: Stand by.
097:08:43 Swigert: We'll get you that by the next pass.
097:08:46 Eisele: Roger. Plenty of time. [Pause]
097:08:55 Schirra: Jack. On that tropical storm coming up there: do you expect that to come up into the Gulf of Mexico? [Pause]
097:09:01 Swigert: Right now, the forecast that is past, it is up into the west coast of Florida. [Pause]
097:09:08 Schirra: I see. [Pause]
097:09:15 Eisele: Jack, on that pass, would you log the following pictures, magazine S? Starting down around about 55. I got two good pictures of Houston, two of Nee Orleans, Mobile Bay, Pensacola. Wally got the Mississippi Delta, the Fort Walter area, and that was about it. The Cape was cloudy, patchy, broken. [Long pause]
097:09:41 Swigert: Okay. Copy of that. [Pause]
097:09:48 Schirra: Jack, I would recommend to the next crew that try to eliminate as much bite-size food; that's bothering all of us already. [Pause]
097:09:58 Swigert: Okay. We copy.
097:10:00 Schirra: The hot one [garble]. [Long pause]
097:10:17 Schirra: However, the breakfast dring is going over very well, but we need a better type of food. [Pause]
097:10:27 Swigert: Okay. Copy. I think he - wait till I get my sheet out now. [Long pause]
097:11:08 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
097:11:34 Swigert: Apollo 7, Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
097:11:40 Unidentifiable crewmember: Go ahead.
097:11:42 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Regarding this daylight scanning telescope start count: we're not going to be able to do it with the present REFSMMAT because of the gimbal lock problem. We understood yesterday that we saw more stars than we anticipated at the 220-degree line of sight, and we would like very much to get this test in at the 70-degree line of sight. Over.
Comm break.
097:12:51 Swigert: Apollo 7, Arollo 7, Houston. Did you copy?
097:12:54 Schirra: Yes, we read you.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 97 hours, 14 minutes into the flight with Apollo 7 out in the far eastern tip of Antigua acquisition circle. We're rather sure that will wind up the comm for this pass. This is Apollo Control in Houston.
Apollo Control, Houston; 97 hours, 17 minutes, and through Ascension we've been having this interesting conversation.
ASCENSION (REV 62)
097:23:12 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Ascension.
097:23:15 Schirra: Roger.
097:23:17 Swigert: Roger. You are five-by. Could you copy our conversation on the scanning telescope star count that we were giving you over Bermuda? [Pause]
097:23:26 Schirra: I got you. Roger, Jack.
097:23:27 Swigert: okay.
097:23:28 Schirra: I've got some information for you. In minimum impulse and roll, if the stick is released, it will fire a jet in the opposite direction exactly as in the simulator. [Long pause]
097:23:42 Swigert: Could you go over that again, please?
097:23:45 Schirra: Okay. In pulse mode, minimum impulse ...
097:23:48 Swigert: Roger.
097:23:50 Schirra: ... if one impulse is entered - say roll right - the stick is released and brought to neutral; it will cross neutral and roll left one pulse. [Pause]
097:23:59 Swigert: Roger. Copy that.
097:24:01 Schirra: It's the same as the sticks in the simulator; it's not unique. [Pause]
097:24:06 Swigert: Okay. The other thing we wanted to ask you to do: you could do the H2 stratification test whenever you can fit it in there. [Long pause]
097:24:18 Schirra: Roger. Thank you. That's inside the next half hour. [Pause]
097:24:22 Swigert: Okay. We'd like you to put your tape recorder forward switch to FORWARD. [Pause]
097:24:29 Cunningham: Roger. Are you through dumping?
097:24:31 Swigert: Affirmative.
097:24:34 Cunningham: It is in FORWARD.
097:24:36 Swigert: Okay. The other thing we'd like to get is the general crew status with a status on each man. Could you give us kind of a complete rundown on each man, how they're feeling today? [Long pause]
097:24:59 Schirra: This is CDR. I still have a rather thick mucous nose cold, but none of us are coughing. We're very well rested although last night was rather a short night; and we'll take advantage of the longer hours tonight to catch up again. We'we all had plenty to eat and to drink, if not too much. The sight of the food is just too rich for us. I'm still on aspirin, and I'm off Actifed at this time, and all of us are getting out of Actifed. We don't have enough left to keep taking it for the length of the mission. We'll use it prior to reentry. [Long pause]
097:25:45 Eisele: This is the CMP. My only complaint is a head cold, just like Wally. I find that my ears plug up now and then. I would take the Actifed except for running out, and I want to save it for reentry in case we need it then. Other than that, I'm in good shape. I've had plenty to eat and drink, had plenty of sleep. No problem. [Long pause]
097:26:06 Eisele: Are you still reading, Jack?
097:26:08 Swigert: Roger.
097:26:10 Cunningham: Okay. I'm in good shape. I've been sleeping a little better every night, and my ears are just barely clear some mornings and sometimes not. I don't feel bad; I don't feel like I have a cold. I just feel like I'm pretty well stuffed up and on the verge of getting one. [Long pause]
097:26:27 Swigert: Okay. Copied that. [Long pause]
097:26:43 Swigert: Apollo 7, have any of you had indications of a temperature rise? [Pause]
097:26:50 Schirra: Negative.
097:26:51 Swigert: Okay. Fine. Sometime - no hurry on it - you might give us a count an your medication remaining. We kind of lost track here. [Long pause]
097:27:03 Schirra: Okay. We've been logging it and calling it down, Jim, if you haven't gotten a report on every bit of it. One interesting observation, with a head cold, the fluids do not flow down the throat and cause any lung problems. It stays up in the sinuses. This is due to zero gravity, I'm sure. [Long pause]
097:27:31 Swigert: Okay. Copy that. [Pause]
097:27:36 Eisele: Jack, this is Donn. I just did a daylight P52. How it happened, we rolled over so that we're staring up to the stars. I did P52 and picked a pair that worked, so I lucked out. It turns out that you can, in general, see stars in the sextant provided it's not too close to the sun and provided all the optics will pull them in for you, but of course, it is impossible to see anything through the telescope under these conditions. [Long pause]
097:28:03 Swigert: Understand ...
097:28:04 Eisele: ... by the stars I marked on explicitly. I assume they are right because the star difference angles was proper. [Pause]
097:28:12 Swigert: Okay. Real fine.
097:28:15 Eisele: I wouldn't want to hang my hat on that if I were going to the Moon, however. [Pause]
097:28:20 Swigert: Roger. Understand.
097:28:22 Schirra: I'd like to make the point; he confirmed the two stars by the star angle difference, like four balls 1. [Pause]
097:28:29 Swigert: Okay.

097:28:35 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We show that one panel is still isolated, and we're about to lose you over Ascension. We'll pick you up at Tananarive here at 497 plus 38. [Long pause]

097:53:21 Cunningham: Roger. Jack, I tried to put the primary evaporator back on the line, and it didn't make it. [Pause]
097:53:27 Swigert: Okay. I was trying to reach you through ARIA 1 to do that S-band DTO for ARIA. [Long pause]
097:53:38 Cunningham: We didn't hear you.
097:53:40 Swigert: Roger. I didn't hear you, either. On your question about the film over the stateside pass for the pictures of Tucson: the film to use is S0121. [Long pause]
097:53:52 Cunningham: Roger. Thank you. [Pause]
097:53:57 Schirra: Jack out of curiosity, how many different kinds of S-band passes are there? I'll give you time to figure that one out. [Long pause]
097:54:27 Swigert: 7, it appears to be about 20 or 30 different types of modes and conditions for S-band communication tries here. [Long pause]

This is Apollo Control, Houston at 97 hours 56 minutes. In the recent swing across the Indian Ocean we tried without success to raise the spacecraft through an ARIA aircraft over the Indian Ocean, and as I say, the, - we were not successful but we have established com however through Carnarvon and here is how it's going.
097:56:21 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. On the primary evaporator: did you reservice it before your attemps to put it back onthe line? [Pause]
097:56:30 Cunningham: Sure did. We serviced it over Canaries. [Pause]
097:56:37 Swigert: Okay. Copy.
097:56:40 Cunningham: Temperatures are even running pretty hot. Can you confirm that both of my radiator panels are flowing now with the individual temperatures, please? [Long pause]
097:56:51 Swigert: 7, both of your RAD panels look good. [Pause]
097:56:57 Cunningham: Roger. Thank you. [Long pause]

097:57:38 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
097:57:40 Schirra: I will give you a medication count. There are three categories: Actifed, aspirin, and one more pill [garble]. [Long pause]
097:57:57 Swigert: Apollo 7, I didn't - I copy that you are going to give us the quantity remaining of the three medications. [Pause]
097:58:05 Schirra: Negative; the quantity used per crewman,
097:58:08 Swigert: Okay. Go ahead with the quantity used.
097:58:11 Schirra: Roger. CDR: Actifed six, aspirin 17, Lomatil two; CMP: Actifed two, aspirin two. [Long pause]

GUAM (REV 62)
098:09:02 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Guam. [Pause]
098:09:07 Schirra: Roger. [Pause]
098:09:13 Swigert: 7, we haven't had a window status check in a while. How are they doing? [Pause]
098:09:19 Schirra: Roger. They're - why don't we give you a check the next daylight, Jack? [Pause]
098:09:24 Swigert: Okay. Real fine. And the other thing I was kind of curious about, Wally, can you hear the thruster - the RCS thrusters - fire? [Pause]
098:09:33 Schirra: Affirmative.
098:09:35 Swigert: Okay. Real fine.
098:09:37 Schirra: Only when they light off; we can't hear them when they're burning. [Pause]
098:09:41 Swigert: Okay.
098:09:44 Schirra: Right now, the main thing is you can hear a pulse. It sounds like your hearing - as Donn describes it - a water barrel, a thump, a clunkn, no hissing sound to them at all. [Pause]
098:09:53 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
Apollo Control here 98 hours, 10 minutes into the flight, and through Guam a few minutes ago we acquired, we really hadn't been expected, because the spacecraft is passing below Guam. But we're getting excellent comm. Here's how it's going.
098:10:09 Schirra: However, the thing seems to have almost a surge of power. It fluctuates back and forth on a sort of a cyclic beat, rather than steady, smooth application of power. [Long pause]
098:10:26 Swigert: Okay. Copy. We're about 40 seconds from LOS Guam; Hawaii at 98:18. [Pause]

098:19:58 Swigert: Roger. Copy. We would like to send you up a NAV load, and I'm ready with a NAV check when you're ready to copy. Would you go to ACCEPT? [Long pause]
098:20:20 Schirra: Okay an the NAV check.
098:20:22 Swigert: Okay. Comming up. The NAV check as follows: 102 plus 30 plus 0000 minus 1154 plus 06596 1522. [Long pause]
098:20:50 Cunningham: Roger. Read back as follows: 102 30 four balls minus 1154 minus 06596 1522. Over. [Pause]
098:21:00 Swigert: That's correct. [Pause]
098:21:05 Schirra: Jack, did you get the impact of the Moon being in the telescope? [Pause]
098:21:09 Swigert: Roger. We're discussing that right now.
098:21:11 Schirra: Yes, you don't count stars when you look at the Moon. [Pause]
098:21:17 Swigert: Roger. We're scrething our heads.
098:21:19 Schirra: And it's inertial like we are. [Long pause]
098:21:31 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. The load is in; we're finished; the computer is yours. [Pause]

This is Apollo Control, Houston 98 hours 25 minutes. We're in touch with Apollo 7 through Hawaii. Earlier through Guam you heard Wally Schirra ask - relay a message and the more understandable parts of the communication was the name John Healy. John Healy is an engineer who headed the management development team which worked on Spacecraft 101, now called Apollo 7. He is an employee of the North American Rockwell Company, and he was in the viewing room and heard the transmission. We're not sure we understood it fully and it's being listened to in very slow time and transcribed for Mr. Healy's benefit. We have this communication, however, by Hawaii.

098:31:10 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We're all ready for the keying test. [Pause]
098:31:19 Cunningham: Wait one on that keying test.
098:31:21 Swigert: Roger. [Pause]
098:31:29 Cunningham: Okay. I'll go ahead and give you a keying test. We're coming up on a photo shortly. [Pause]
098:31:36 Swigert: Roger, 7. Could you stand by one? We lost [garble]. [Pause]
098:31:40 Cunningham: Okay. I'll stand by. [Long pause]
098:32:31 Cunningham: Ready to go on the keying?
098:32:34 Swigert: Not yet. We're still standing by. [Long pause]
098:32:57 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We're ready for the keying test. [Pause]

098:34:18 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We are through with the keying test. You can reconfigure your spacecraft per the Flight Plan, and you only made two mistakes. [Pause]
098:34:27 Cunningham: Yes, I put a couple of dits instead of dashs, didn't I?
098:34:30 Swigert: Roger.
098:34:33 Cunningham: Back to configuration.
098:34:35 Swigert: Okay. Copy.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston. That keying test was a test of an emergency communication system. And the message is as follows: "This is a test of the emergency key." You heard the CapCom acknowledge two slight errors as Walt Cunningham sent that, but it was all together readable. So we've communicated by voice, by televisions and now by telegraph key today.
HUNTSVILLE through ANTIGUA (REV 63)
098:37:42 Schirra: Last shot crossing States was 67, and Corpus Christi magasine 0. [Pause]
098:37:49 Swigert: Okay. Copy that.
098:37:52 Schirra: We are crossing the Gulf now, looking for the storm. [Long pause]
098:38:04 Schirra: You can give us a MARK when you think we are adjacent to it. [Pause]
098:38:08 Swigert: Okay. Will do, Wally. You got a little ways to go yet.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston. The crew should be passing over that large storm Gladys here very shortly and perhaps they'll comment on it. The emergency key transmission was done through the voice com push-to-talk key for it was literally being pushed on and off like a telegraph key.
098:39:25 Schirra: Jack, that looks like one big white overcast about 12 o'clock. [Pause]
098:39:29 Swigert: That should be it. The tropical storm will be south of your flight path here; your flight path should take you right over Cuba, and the tropical storm will be south of the western tip of Cuba. [Long pause]
098:39:43 Schirra: Okay.
098:39:45 Schirra: We'll take a strip going into it; I think that's the best bet.
098:39:48 Swigert: Okay. [Long pause]
098:40:23 Cunningham: We've got one big stormy area out here, Jack. I don't pick up a characteristic tropical storm. [Pause]
098:40:31 Swigert: Okay. Right nov, the wind speeds are about 45 knots. Tomorrow sometime, the winds are forecast to pick up to 70. [Long pause]
098:40:43 Schirra: If it comes up in the Gulf, you can all go down and bail my boat out. [Pause]
098:40:52 Swigert: Roger. There are a few other people with the same problem.
098:40:55 Schirra: Understand. They've got a better chance of getting to their boat than I have right now. [Pause]
098:41:03 Swigert: I think you're right.
098:41:06 Schirra: [Garble]. [Pause]
098:41:12 Swigert: I think that is part of the duties of the support crew; we'll take care of it, Wally.
098:41:15 Schirra: I think [garble] Jack. [Long pause]
098:41:39 Schirra: Jack, frame 68 was the cloud cover that - not really a storm I could discern. [Pause]
098:41:46 Swigert: Roger, copy. [Long pause]
098:42:04 Schirra: Could you get our rates down there, Jack? [Pause]
098:42:10 Swigert: Roger. Stand by.
098:42:11 Schirra: Roger. The pitch rate now is not something I put in. It just comes from coupling with that little atmosphere of convectional air. [Long pause]
098:42:34 Swigert: Wally, right now, it looks like we've got a pitch rate of pins .3. [Pause]
098:42:39 Schirra: Roger. I don't think we have anithing to worry about on one or two pulses, and the spacecraft actually is torquing E itself in pitch, that's all. It's costing us earlier on the O radiator degradation test. We think it's just the way it goes through an attitude at a certain atmospheric affect, what little there is. [Long pause]
098:42:59 Swigert: Okay. [Long pause]
098:43:10 Schirra: That's a pretty good track of our attitude there, and I had - oh, less than one pulse in that direction in pitch, and you can see what happened. [Pause]
098:43:20 Swigert: Okay. We'll get a little more accurate hack at it when we take a look at this strip chart. [Pause]
098:43:25 Schirra: Right that's what I'd like to have you take note of.
098:43:27 Swigert: Okay. [Long pause]
098:43:53 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. We'd like to have you turn your O2 fans tank 2 for 3 minutes. [Pause]
098:43:59 Cunningham: Roger. On. [Pause]
098:44:04 Cunningham: I finished the hydrogen stratification test, and it was about like the first one. There was a slightly noticeable pressure decrease when I turned the fans on, on the order of maybe 2 psi, something like that, and it's stabilized out right there. [Long pause]
098:44:30 Swigert: Okay. Real fine, Walt.
098:44:32 Schirra: Jack, note the pitch rate right now. It is decreasing, yet I have not turned any pitch pulses in, and there are no thrusters firing. It's a good pass to make note of what we're talking about. [Long pause]
098:44:48 Swigert: Okay. We got it. We'll look at it real close.
098:44:50 Schirra: Okay. There were no pitch pulses at that point. [Long pause]
098:45:01 Schirra: We've been noting this all during the flight and thought on this this pass to get a record on it. Note the pitch rate is decreasing all the time. [Long pause]
098:45:12 Swigert: Okay. We'll realy take a good look at it.
098:45:14 Schirra: Okay. This is something we have a beck of a time trying to explain to ourselves. It was pitching in the right direction, so I wasn't going to take it out. It's almost going to pitch zero. [Long pause]
098:45:41 Schirra: There was no IVA during tbat either, by the way.
098:45:44 Swigert: Okay. Copy that. It sounds like you got a built-in ORB rate torquer there. [Pause]
098:45:48 Schirra: Yes. See there. It's almost zero pitch. I haven't done a thing to it. In fact. I've got to do some more pitching to get up to the 326. [Pause]
098:45:57 Swigert: Roger. That's what we're looking -.
098:45:58 Schirra: [Garble]. That's two more. [Long pause]
098:46:16 Schirra: We knew what was heating us up during the radiator degradation test. We were going through these kind of attitudes and had to work to get through them. [Pause]
098:46:25 Swigert: Copy. We still were nominal on fuel during that whole test. [Pause]
098:46:29 Schirra: Roger. Understand. But what we're telling you is about like this. I put three pulses, and it's back to zero again. [Pause]
098:46:38 Swigert: Roger...
098:46:39 Schirra: [Garble].
098:46:42 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, being nominal on that test implies that the three points were present. Donn and I - on numerous tries, the simulator ran below the nominal fuel usage on that thing where there were no torques. [Long pause]
098:47:01 Swigert: That's real fine information, Walt. [Pause]
098:47:05 Schirra: I put three more pulses in. [Long pause]
098:47:28 Schirra: Houston, do you still read?
098:47:30 Swigert: Roger. We are still reading you, Wally.
098:47:32 Schirra: That's zero again with no pulses. [Pause]
098:47:39 Schirra: You'll have some fun reading this one. Over. [Pause]
098:47:44 Swigert: Say again.
098:47:45 Schirra: You'll have some fun redusing the data on this one. [Pause]
098:47:50 Swigert: We have people busy on it, and we are watching it right here. [Pause]
098:47:54 Schirra: That's it. We think it is kind of an interesting phenomenon. I'm back to zero again. [Garble]. The best exercise in roceted direction [garble]. [Long pause]
098:48:09 Schirra: Two more pulses. [Long pause]
098:48:30 Schirra: And it's back to zero again. [Garble]. [Long pause]
098:48:32 Schirra (onboard): Zero clocked her, coordinated command, and gave it about 0.2.
098:48:44 Schirra: You might know it's not precise exept in COMMAND, but it is much more precise than it is in a simulator. [Pause]
098:48:50 Swigert: Roger.
098:48:53 Schirra: I could call 0.2 and give it to you. [Long pause]
098:49:09 Cunningham (onboard): Hey, Jack, how are we doing in our other consumables?
098:49:11 Cunningham: Well, I notice from the Flight Plan that 60 percent hydrogen test is nominally at 102 to 103 hours. Are we running pretty much nominal there or a little behind or what? [Long pause]
098:49:24 Swigert: We are about to lose you here over Antigua. We will pick you up at Ascension at 56.
Long comm break.
Apollo Control, Houston here 98 hours and 49 minutes into the flight. A most interesting pass. You heard Wally Schirra describe an unusual phenomena, apparently the crew has noted earlier in the flight, and at one point Schirra described it as almost an atmospheric effect on the spacecraft. That's at 90 miles out, nautical miles, altitude and of course, that communication has triggered a lot of people to get busy and look charts and look at data. I can imagine they will be busy for some time trying to run the answer to that one down. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, 98 hours, 56 minutes into the flight and through Ascension, we expect contact any moment. We'll standby and keep the line open.

098:58:07 Swigert: Okay. You're loud and clear. Wally, on this pitch rate: it would help us out a little bit - we could get a little bit more data - if you would put your GDC on FDAI number 1. [Long pause]
098:58:19 Schirra: What we had was right at 90 degrees. We're only locked into a deadband now, Jack. We're right about - pitched up at 090, straight up. [Long pause]
098:58:35 Swigert: Okay. Copy. We get better data on that pitch rate for - on telemetry if we can put the GDC on FDAI number 1. [Long pause]
098:58:46 Schirra: I see. Okay. Next time we see it, we'll do that. [Pause]
098:58:50 Swigert: Okay, and - [Pause]
098:58:56 Schirra: It appears that, apparently, we had the spacecraft pointed straight up, the command on the X-axis this morning, away from the Earth on the radial. [Pause]
098:59:05 Swigert: You say that's when it occurred, when the X-axis was pointed away from the Earth? [Pause]
098:59:09 Schirra: That's the way it was this time, and that's the wayit seems to be in the past. [Pause]
098:59:13 Swigert: Okay. Real fine. That gives us a good clue.
098:59:15 Unidentifiable crewmember: It's not active now, CapCom?
098:59:18 Schirra: No. It's rotated around now. [Pause]
098:59:22 Swigert: Okay. Has it quit now, wally? [Pause]
098:59:26 Schirra: That's affirm. We're nov about 140 degrees local Tertical. [Pause]
098:59:30 Swigert: Okay. Real fine. And relative to Walt's question on the hydrogen usage, we figure you're about 1 pound above nominal. [Long pause]
098:59:42 Cunningham: Roger. And we look like we are even better off with oxygen. [Pause]
098:59:46 Swigert: That's affirmative.

099:02:38 Swigert: Stand by. [Long pause]
099:02:57 Swigert: Okay. Walt, on that question: there is really not any need to use any of the antibiotic; they don't feel that would help or cure a cold. [Long pause]
099:03:12 Cunningham: Well, so far, I've been able to resist pretty much if getting one, but Donn's coming down I think a little bit better here, if there's some way I could hold it off, I would just as soon take the pill. Or do they just want me to go ahead and catch it, then treat it? [Pause]
099:03:21 Swigert: Okay. We'll pick you up over Tananarive.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston; 99 hours, 4 minutes into the flight. You heard Walter Cunningham asking about taking an antibiotic for himself in order to prevent his getting a cold. At least that's the way we understood it and the doctor advised that would not help prevent him from contacting the same cold that bothered Donn Eisele and Wally Schirra today. This is Apollo Control, Houston.

Apollo Control, Houston; we're 99 hours, 16 minutes. We had a brief chat with the crew by Tananarive a few minutes ago, and from the tone of the conversation with Walt Cunningham, it sounded to us like things were quieting down in order to let CMP Donn Eisele get to sleep. He's, according to the Flight Plan, about 1-1/2 hours to 2 hours into his sleep cycle. At this point, Cunningham did report that the spacecraft was powering down and here's the way he reported it.

099:29:42 Swigert: And the next question, was the keying24 done with the panel switch ow the mike button? [Pause]
099:29:50 Cunningham: I keyed with the mike button on my control head. [Pause]
099:29:55 Swigert: Okay. Thank you.
099:29:58 Schirra: Jack, we have one for you.
099:30:00 Swigert: Go ahead.
099:30:02 Schirra: Okay. We powered down, and just checking over my CAL's, it would appear that the SPS logic bus 3 switch might help. Does it? [Long pause]
099:30:14 Swigert: Would you say again? We didn't copy, Wally. [Pause]
099:30:18 Schirra: Okay. I said I've got the SPS powered down.
099:30:20 Swigert: Roger.
099:30:21 Schirra: Does the SPS logic bus 3 save us any power? [Pause]
099:30:27 Swigert: Okay. stand by.
099:30:28 Schirra: ... when added to the rest? [Pause]
099:30:33 Swigert: Okay. Stand by. We'll get you the answer. [Long pause]
099:30:46 Schirra: Roger. Log 15 clicks of water for the CMP. [Pause]
099:30:51 Swigert: Okay. Will do.
099:30:54 Cunningham: And, Jack, when you get a chance, can we get an update on the RCS profile I have onboard? [Pause]
099:31:04 Swigert: Okay. In work.
099:31:07 Cunningham: Thank you. [Long pause]

099:32:36 Swigert: Apollo 7, could you get us some results of your scaning telescope test ...
099:32:37 Cunningham: ... when we operate the DMP on AUXILIARY, we seem to be [garble] a pretty good check on that, haven't we? [Long pause]
099:32:48 Swigert: I'm sorry, Walt, I was transmitting somthing to you at the same time. Can you say again? [Pause]
099:32:54 Cunningham: Roger. We have, coming up over Carnarvon, PMP powered AUXILIARY with an S-Band check. Have we already satisfied some of those by an earlier operation in AUXILIARY for some time? [Long pause]
099:33:18 Cunningham: I guess I'm asking do you want to continue that test; should I plan on PMP AUXILIARY; and what were you saying when I transmitted? [Pause]
099:33:27 Swigert: Okay. Walt, we do want to put the PMP to AUXILIARY. That puts us in our PCM down on the FM. [Long pause]
099:33:38 Swigert: Put your ...
099:33:40 Cunningham: [Garble] a long time early in the flight like that? [Long pause]

099:58:10 Schirra: [Garble]. [Pause]
This is Apollo Control, Houston. We have good com now and Schirra is going to give us a window report.
099:58:14 Schirra: Number 2 window is in real good shape, but the perimeter - it's fogging around the perimeter particularly in the upper portion. About - oh, it's very thick [garble] about half an inch in from perimeter and thins out to a perfectly good, clear window. The hatch window has never been usable since shortly after insertion into orbit. Large condesation inside now in the inner surface of the inner pane; and the center of the window, a circle about 5 inches in diameter, looks like snowflake crystals all across it; it's actually opaque.

100:02:09 Swigert: Say again.
100:02:12 Schirra: [Garble]. [Pause]
100:02:16 Swigert: We didn't copy, Wally. Could you give us window number 1 again? [Pause]
100:02:23 Schirra: I think the window is getting worse, clouding the vision due to the overboard dump. The particles depending on the spacecraft attitude to bounce off it or collect on it. [Long pause]
100:02:42 Schirra: Do you read?
100:02:43 Swigert: Okay. Got it.

This is Apollo Control, Houston; 100 hours, 21 minutes into the flight. Questions have risen from that last pass across the States, actually down through the Texas - the Guaymas, Texas, then Antigua area. The test being carried out there by our CapCom, Jack Swigert, here is a voice relay test wherein he broadcasted a count and several other things to the spacecraft and then the voice transmission was to be immediately relayed back to Earth. We're not just sure yet how successful or how unsuccessful the test was. We know it was at least particially successful, but the idea is in later flights when we are flying a lunar module, we would like to be able to set up this relay condition from - say pilots or astronauts in a lunar module, relay their com through the Command Module and back down to Earth, out at lunar distance, and we are interested in seeing just how well that routing works. We have no additional comm and this is Apollo Control, Houston.

101:43:57 Schirra (onboard): This is CDR. Some of our equipment is starting to show signs of age. The Exer-Genie, although used somewhat extensively, is starting to fray and not run smoothly. The bootees on my Teflon suit are starting to unravel and come apart. The microphone on my right-hand headset is cracked, and, except for being taped together, would not function.
101:44:33 Schirra (onboard): The ear tube on Walt Cunningham's right-hand headset is coming apart. The COMM carrier connectors to the suits are all getting frayed at the fitting where they make up to the sUit. I think it is because we take these off and on with a great amount of frequency.
101:45:04 Schirra (onboard): We've had a problem with the wristwatch straps. They are much too long for a normal shirtsleeve attire and are just about right for the pressure suit. They should be made as small as possible for the pressure suit, and then they might have a chance of fitting the wrist with two turns around it.
101:45:25 Schirra (onboard): Now, one technique was used on Eisele's watch, to pass the watch through a Velcro band. And some technique similar to this might work for both suited and unsuited work.
101:46:04 Schirra (onboard): We've had a continuous problem with the 70mm back in that the slider plate for removal of the back will not prevent actuation of the shutter. This is not designed that way in the stock Hasselblad; it has been modified nicely to cause this effect in our crew camera.
101:46:38 Schirra (onboard): The last-minute changes in film seem to be par for the course in this business. And it's a big mistake to have four different ASA films onboard, particularly when we pass the camera back and forth rapidly in a drifting mode when a good target's available. We shot our S0117 the first day or so at ASA 64. And this was so we would not waste the 368 as well, which is also ASA 64. Now we have S0121, nominally for shooting at ASA 60, and soon we will be shooting Panatomic-X at ASA 45. This is not the way to run a railroad. There are many - there are many films available with a common ASA available. For high-speed work, naturally we prefer the ASA 1000.
101:48:06 Schirra (onboard): At this point in the flight, over 100 hours, it's almost impossible to believe we started this flight out with the pressure suit on. The environment just doesn't even seem to be acceptable to the big lumpy. And I suspect that we are going to put them on with great misgivings after the time required. If our head conditions are not cleared up in time, I believe we probably will reject using those suits. This is not a decision at this point, but merely an opinion.

102:46:10 Schirra: And the water's tasting very good, so we'll chlorinate one more time and see how bat it gets, and that may be the last dose. [Pause]
102:46:19 Evans: I understand what you're saying.
102:46:22 Schirra: Okay. Thank you. [Pause]
102:46:31 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. [Long pause]
102:46:51 Schirra: [Garble] and see where we stand. [Long pause]
102:47:04 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. You're unreadable. [Pause]
102:47:08 Schirra: We predict that we should chlorinate every other day so we'll see how that works out. [Pause]
102:47:18 Cunningham: Is Hawaii in RELAY modes? [Pause]
102:47:22 Evans: Walt, that's affirmative. Configure for RELAY mode prior to 103 plus 02. [Pause]
102:47:31 Cunningham: Wilco. Okay. We'll be on Duplex A as we go the hill now. [Pause]
102:47:37 Evans: Affirmative. And Walt, we'd like you to cycle O2 tank 2 fans ON for 5 minutes, then OFF. [Long pause]
102:47:51 Cunningham: Then what? [Pause]
102:48:01 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite ommi.
102:48:04 Schirra: Ron, we just made a big discovery. I just turned the O2 fan number 2 down ON, and it started our DET in the lover equipment bay. [Long pause]
102:48:17 Evans: Beautiful. [Pause]
102:48:23 Schirra: Did you read that?
102:48:25 Evans: Affirmsaive. DET in the LEB atarted when you turned the fans on. [Pause]
102:48:30 Schirra: That's correct. [Pause]
102:48:37 Schirra: Always excitement up here. That lends credence to the theory that it does touch the spacecraft. [Long pause]
102:48:49 Evans: Say your last comment, Wally.
102:48:51 Schirra: That lends credence to the theory that the fans do pulse the spacecraft. [Pause]

This is Apollo Control, 104 hours, 42 minutes. Hawaii has LOS now. We didn't have too much communication there, apparently for a while the spacecraft was still in that relay test configuration. We talked to them briefly but then we had some land line problems in the communications network. Apollo 7 now starts a long sweep where it will be out of voice contact. The next station to acquire that's capable of voice is the tracking ship Mercury at 105 hours, 52 minutes. This is Mission Control Houston.
104:59:57 Schirra (onboard): Houston CapCom, Apollo 7. Do you read?
This is Apollo Control at 105 hours 06 minutes. Apollo 7 has just started its 67th revolution. We're out of range of tracking stations until we get to the Mercury. We will get some telemetry at Pretoria, but no voice capability there. We estimate acquiring at the Mercury at 10S hours 52 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo control at 105 hours 30 minutes, Apollo 7 is over Africa on its 67 revolution. We've just ended the period set aside in the Flight Plan for the commander and the lunar module pilot to eat and the Command Module pilot is still in his sleep period. We've been out of voice contact with Apollo 7 since the Hawaii station. We'll acquire at Mercruy at 105 hours 52 minutes. This is mission control, Houston.

105:56:48 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Your readback is correct. Correct pressure now is 104. [Pause]
105:56:56 Cunningham: Roger. I'll switch rings and give another one. [Pause]
105:57:01 Evans: 103.
105:57:03 Cunningham: 103. We are GO on ECS redundant, and we've just changed our caniser now. [Pause]

105:57:25 Cunningham: Roger. Are we coming up LOS?
105:57:28 Evans: Roger. About I minute to LOS. I can give you a figure 3 dash 1 on your RCS update, if you want. [Long pause]
105:57:42 Cunningham: Go ahead.
105:57:43 Evans: Roger. At 104 hours, you have a total of 715, your SCS readline is 583. Your DAP readline 520. Hydrid readline 247, and those are points you'll have to plot on your curve. [Long pause]
105:58:08 Cunningham: Very good. Look like [garble]. [Pause]
105:58:14 Evans: Yeah. It's looking good. Be advised that quad A, as far as the quad readline, is just right on the SCS redline; all others are in good shape. [Long pause]
105:58:25 Cunningham: Roger. What hapened to your transmission at Hawaii? Did you break up on land line? [Pause]
105:58:30 Evans: Affirmative. Broke up on land line. [Pause]
105:58:37 Cunningham: Okay. Stnding by for Redstone.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 105 hours, 58 minutes. Mercury has LOS now. We updated the crew on this pass with what they call the block up date. That's reentry information the flight crew would need if it should have to reenter during the next few revolutions when it's essentially off the tracking range. We gave them the information through rev 74. We also gave them a report on their total RCS propellant has 715 pounds remaining and that gives us plenty of capability for the backup modes of deorbit using the RCS system instead of the service propulsion system if that should be necessary. Wally Schirra reported that they had just completed changing the lithium hydroxide cannister there are two of these cannisters in the system, one is changed every 12 hours, the lithium hydroxide removes the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Apollo 7 will miss the Guam station this time also the Hawaii station. The next station to acquire is the tracking ship Redstone in the South Pacific, acquisition there at 106 hours, 24 minutes. This is Mission Control Houston.
Apollo Control at 106 hours 24 minutes. As Apollo 7 comes within range of the Redstone tracking ship, Donn Eisele should be awake and perhaps eating breakfast. Wally Schirra and Walt Cunningham should be beginning their sleeping period. We'll stand by through this pass.
REDSTONE (REV 67)
106:25:04 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone.
106:25:07 Cunningham: Roger, Houston. Five-by-five.
106:25:10 Evans: Roger. Loud and clear. Walt, I have some onboard readouts I'd like to get. [Pause]
106:25:17 Cunningham: Go ahead.
106:25:18 Evans: Roger. SPS fuel and oxidizer quantity and the oxidizer unbalance, if any. [Pause]
106:25:28 Cunningham: Our PUGS is not working I was told, so I haven't paid any attention to it, but I show the oxidazier unbalance reading a minus 300 or decreased 300, and it kinda jumps around during a burn. I don't think it means anything at all. The quantity is remaining 17.1 percent oxidizer, 18.2 percent fuel. Over. [Long pause]
106:25:58 Evans: Roger. Copy. And your Service Module RCS propellant quantittes? [Pause]
106:26:04 Evans: And your batt C volts, while you're over there. [Long pause]
106:26:21 Cunningham: Houston, do you read now?
106:26:24 Evans: I missed it. Say again.
106:26:26 Cunningham: Okay. Ring A ia about 51 percent. [Pause]
106:26:32 Evans: Roger.
106:26:35 Cunningham: Ring C, 56 percent.
106:26:38 Evans: Roger.
106:26:40 Cunningham: Ring D, 62 percent. [Pause]
106:26:45 Evans: Roger.
106:26:47 Cunningham: And B we don't count.
106:26:49 Evans: Concur.
106:26:52 Evans: Now, your batt C volts and your systems test meters 5 and 6, A throgh D, when you get a chance. [Long pause]
106:27:03 Cunningham: Roger. Batt bus A is reading 36 volts; batt bus B is reading 36.2 volts; 5 C iS 5 volts; 5 D is 5 volts; 6 D is 5 volts; 6 C is 5 volts; 6 B is 5 volts; 6 A is 5 volts. [Long pause]
106:27:39 Evans: Roger. Copy. All sistems tests are 5 volts, and batt C we still need. [Pause]
106:27:45 Cunningham: Okay. batt C coming. Batt C shovs 36.3 volts, and our present plans are not to heat the Command Module RCS prior to deorbit.
106:27:48 Evans: We concur so far. [Long pause]
106:28:07 Cunningham: Any late breaking news in Houston, Ron?
106:28:10 Evans: Say again.
106:28:13 Cunningham: What's the latest news in Houston? [Pause]
106:28:17 Evans: I have Lima Sierra for you. [Pause]
106:28:23 Cunningham: Vell, go ahead [garble]. [Pause]
106:28:27 Evans: Roger. Lima Sierra, 072/061. And I have a Sierra Fox Trot at 075. [Long pause]
106:28:47 Cunningham: Sierra Fox Trot at 075? First there was Lima Sierra 072/061? [Pause]

106:29:08 Evans: Apollo 7. Apollo 7. [Pause]
106:29:14 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Request cycle O2 fan for 5 minutes in OFF. [Pause]
106:29:21 Cunningham: Okay. I've - w've been leaving number 1 in AUTO; is that your druthers? [Pause]
106:29:28 Evans: We started out the other way and Donn had it the other way, so it's ... [Long pause]
106:29:40 Cunningham: It's in AUTO, and the other one cycle on your callouts, right?
106:29:43 Evans: Tha's affirmative. So you have tank 1 in AUTO and tank 2 fans cycling now. [Pause]
106:29:50 Cunningham: ON for 5 minutes. [Long pause]
106:30:02 Cunningham: Purge on time. [Pause]
106:30:09 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni. [Long pause]
106:30:51 Evans: 7, Houston. We have 1 minute to LOS. Our O2 is about 63 pounds above the nominal Flight Plan at this time, and the H2 is abOUt a half a pound above the nominal Flight Plan. So we're in good shape. [Long pause]
106:31:08 Cunningham: Very good.
Very long comm break.
This Apollo Control at 106 hours 31 minutes. The Redstone has LOS now. Obviously, the commander and the lunar module pilot have not settled down for the night yet, even though their sleep period started at 106 hours on the Flight Plan. The majority of this pass was devoted to updating and to getting onboard readouts of various systems including the SPS propellant quantities, the Service Module RCS propellant quantities and battery voltage readings. Next station to acquire will be Ascension at 106 hours 50 minutes. This is Mission Control, Houston.
This is Apollo control at 106 hours 50 minutes, Apollo 7 is approaching range at Ascension now, we'll stand by there.
ASCENSION (REV 68)
106:52:56 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston, Ascension. Standig by. [Pause]
106:53:01 Schirra: Roger. Thank you, Evans. Any more local news around there to report? [Pause]
106:53:11 Evans: Roger. I can give you - looks like the end of the mission now predicted. The word I have, 25 percent O2 left, and about 6.8 percent H2 left. [Long pause]
106:53:30 Schirra: Roger. I understand; that sounds good. About what I predicted on the hydrogen, I think, isn't it? [Pause]
106:53:39 Evans: I think so. On the fuell cells, perfformance is right down the mide. Purging is turning out nominal. Looks like we'll plan to purge O2 immediately prior to the SPS burn, and this should improve the load-sharing characteristics between the fuell cell and the battery. [Long pause]
106:54:06 Schirra: Roger. I understand, and is the SPS burn nominally what it is in the Flight Plan? [Pause]
106:54:14 Evans: The SPS burns are still per Flight Plans, yes. [Pause]
106:54:22 Schirra: Roger. Thank you. Did they tell you we're purging water before each SPS burn, too? [Pause]
106:54:31 Evans: Say again, Wally.
106:54:33 Schirra: I don't know whether you got the report or not, but there is vast water collecting all over the plumbing on the ECS, and it forms rather large blobs that we're going tO have to take off before we get a burn going again [garble] that's all. [Long pause]
106:54:52 Evans: Roger. I understand you want to collect a11 the water at one place. [Pause]
106:54:57 Schirra: Yes, not on the aft bulkhead.
106:54:59 Evans: Right.
106:55:02 Schirra: [Garble] burn checklist. Did you get to see the TV picture where the [garble] kind of sharp today. [Long pause]
106:55:16 Evans: Yes, we did. It came through real good.
106:55:19 Schirra: Very good. How has that onboard TV been showing up? Could you detect our motion, ar are we moving too fast, ar what? [Long pause]
106:55:31 Evans: No, it's real good. If you have a real fast movement, you get a little bit of a blur, but just in the floating movements. It turns out real fine, real fine. It's amazing; it's much better than anythig I've ever seen in ground testing. [Long pause]
106:55:49 Schirra: Good deal. Is this taped during the [garble] so we can see it? [Pause]
106:55:55 Evans: Yes, it's taped. [Pause]
106:55:59 Schirra: Yes, okay.
106:56:02 Schirra: Donn said he [garble] but 6 years ago he got to me the way. [Pause]
106:56:09 Evans: Missed that, Wally.
106:56:11 Schirra: Six years ago, he asked me that question. [Pause]
106:56:17 Eisele: Only I had a tape on board, and I was about 3 minutes out on an Atlas. [Pause]
106:56:25 Evans: Okay. [Long pause]
106:57:05 Schirra: You still there, Ron?
106:57:06 Evans: Affirm.
106:57:08 Schirra: What's the status of our tape recorder; have dumped it recently? [Pause]
106:57:12 Evans: Roger. The last two passes we had ower the Mercury. It wasn't quite as good. We're checking it out at Redstone now. It was good up untill that time. [Pause]
106:57:22 Schirra: Roger. How about a chart update if you have time?
106:57:25 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
106:57:56 Evans: Walt, can you check - your tape recorder forward switch in FORWARD? [Pause]
106:58:01 Schirra: It is.
106:58:03 Evans: Roger. And here's your Flight Plan update.
106:58:06 Schirra: Go ahead.

107:19:27 Cunningham (onboard): Frame 77 on Sierra back is of sunspots off the river in the valley just south of the Himalayas.
We have LOS at Ascension, don't know whether all that last update got up there or not. During this pass we informed the crew of the predictions that at the end of the mission we'll have 25 percent of the oxygen left 6.8 percent of the hydrogen remaining. We also told them that the fuel cells were performing well. There was a discussion of the water condensation on the environmental control system plumbing, the crew pointed this out during the television transmission this morning, and there was considerable discussion of the quality of the TV and the crew seemed to want confirmation that it was being taped on the ground. They obviously want to take a look at it when they get back. Next station to acquire will be the Mercury at 107 hours 26 minutes. This is mission control, Houston.
This is Apollo Control at 107 hours 26 minutes, and the tracking ship Mercury is about to acquire Apollo 7.

107:27:52 Schirra: Go ahead with the batteries. [Pause]
107:27:56 Evans: Roger. You presently have three; in A 32.7, in B 30.2, in C 39.5 ampere hours. [Long pause]
107:28:12 Schirra: Roger.
107:28:14 Evans: For pre-deorbit, you will have in A 24.8, in B 22.2, in C 39.5, for total of 86.5 ampere hours. [Long pause]
107:28:36 Schirra: Roger.
107:28:38 Evans: Predicted post finding time will be 35 hours. [Pause]
107:28:44 Cunningham: Roger. Understand, Ron. The only concern I have about battery charge is supporting the battery failure on a hybrid deorbit. [Pause]
107:28:53 Evans: Rodger. We concur. You might be interested: it's believed that we've had a slight change in the battery charger characteristics as a function off altitude, such that the charging voltage at the battery terminals is about two- to three-tenths volts lover than normal, and this would account for the decreased charging current. We're conting ground testing to better define this anomaly. [Long pause]
107:29:32 Schirra: This was done subsequent to our lift-off? [Pause]
107:29:37 Evans: Say again, Wally. [Pause]
107:29:42 Schirra: You say this was done after we took off, Ron?
107:29:45 Evans: That's affirmative.
107:29:48 Schirra: It's good work that they found it out.
107:29:51 Evans: Yes, right. No additional battery charging is anticipated at this time. We recommend minimazing battery ON time for all burns. [Long pause]
107:30:09 Schirra: That's kind of hard to do, but we'll do it. [Pause]
107:30:13 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
107:30:19 Schirra: [Garble] we're going to break up and get Donn on watch shortly. He'll be with you on next call. [Pause]
107:30:28 Evans: Roger. Understand. Have a good night's sleep. [Pause]
107:30:32 Schirra: Good night. Ron, did you have PSI system power up? We had it written here on the Flight Plan here at about 107:20. [Long pause]
107:30:45 Evans: Roger. It's in there. We're checing on it right now. [Pause]
107:30:52 Cunningham: We'll hold off an it then, I guess. [Pause]
107:30:56 Schirra: If you need it. You can get it from Donn Eisele over the next Redstone. [Pause]
107:31:01 Evans: Roger. There's no problem there. It's just to run the state vector up. [Pause]
107:31:06 Schirra: Yes.
107:31:09 Cunningham: I guess I'd like to still keep an iron in the fire on that battarey charge status. [Pause]
107:31:19 Evans: Affirmative. We're still working on it. [Pause]
107:31:23 Cunningham: Okay. [Long pause]

Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 107 hours 38 minutes. During this pass, we got a rundown on the battery power. As you heard, we do not anticipate having to charge the batteries again. There is plenty of power through the remainder of the mission, plus the capability for 35 hours post-landing. The battery charger apparently is not charging quite up to specification. It is believed this may be the change in characteristics because of altitude, and a test to try to resolve this problem will be run tonight at the North American Rockwell plant in Downey, California. The next station to acquire is the tracking ship Redstone at 107 hours 57 minutes. This is Mission Control Houston.
Apollo Control at 107 hours, 57 minutes and the Redstone has just acquired Apollo 7. There is no activity scheduled in the Flight Plan at this time. We have indications that the pass at Guam that the - that Wally Schirra and Walt Cunningham were going to sleep. We'll stand by through this pass.

108:24:13 Eisele: Ron, would you log me 15 clicks on water, please. [Pause]
108:24:20 Evans: I missed that, Donn. Say again.
108:24:21 Eisele: Roger. Fifteen. clicks on the water gun.
108:24:23 Evans: Roger. Got it.
108:24:25 Eisele: Okay, I just had a good, solid 8 hours sleep and feel pretty good. I've got a miserable head cold, but other than that, everything's going fine. [Long pause]
108:24:39 Evans: Okay. Sounds good, then. [Pause]
108:24:43 Eisele: My only concern right now is what's going to happen to my ears when we reentry, but I hope by then I'll get over it some. [Pause]
108:24:53 Evans: We kind of feel that you will, and we hope, anyhow. [Pause]
108:24:57 Eisele: I guess we'll cross that when we come to it.
108:25:00 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
108:25:30 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston.
108:25:33 Eisele: Go.
108:25:34 Evans: Roger. We've had a little concern about the voice quality on the DSE there the last couple of dumps, and what we would like you to do is after this pass go ahead aud talk into the tape recorder, mention the time on it, and then give us a time at the next station there, and we can play it back and check it out that way real good. [Long pause]
108:26:00 Eisele: Roger. You say you want me to record somthing on the tape end read the time onto it so you can check it next pass. Is that right? [Pause]
108:26:07 Evans: Affirmative, And then give us a time that you were talking info it. [Pause]
108:26:13 Eisele: Okay. Will do. [Long pause]
108:26:34 Eisele: Ron, I've got some results of a sextant star count we did at about 98 hours. [Pause]
108:26:40 Evans: Roger. Ready to copy.
108:26:43 Eisele: At sunris, first off all, the moon was in the field of view, and that tends to vipe out a lot of stars, but at the sunrise, I counted 12 stars, at plus 04 two stars, plus 08 one stars and plus 12 three stars. [Long pause]
108:27:06 Evans: Roger. I copy, Donn.
108:27:07 Eisele: Then they all went away, except a couple of bright ones right after sunrise. At sunset minus 12 four, minus 8 15, minus 4 30, and at sunset, I saw 40 or more. Of course, this was at the other attitude when the Moon was not in the field of view. I could see the constellation Sagittarius very plainly and all the other major stars that appeared in the teleseope at that time. [Long pause]
108:27:39 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
108:27:45 Eisele: I recommend that we knock off the remaining star counts on the basis that we don't need - realy need - to put window shades up to get dark adapted becouse even if you are dark adapted, if you look in a telescope, you get belted with light; it ruins it anyway. And the best way to get dark adapted is to put your eyeball up there and leave it there for several mimutes. [Long pause]
108:28:08 Evans: I see. Okay. So the window shades are not doing any good is what you're saying there. Right? [Pause]
108:28:14 Eisele: I think so; yes. I don't think the window shades would help that much.
108:28:17 Evans: Okay.
108:28:18 Eisele: It's not the sunlight coming in the windows that keeps you from getting dark adapted anyway. [Pause]
108:28:25 Evans: Roger. [Pause]
108:28:29 Eisele: I had roughly the same sort of light pattern in the telescope that I had an the earlier test. There was a bright ring around the edge of it and a broad bend across the middle off it, and this light pattern didn't disappear in the sunset. [Long pause]
108:28:47 Evans: All right.
108:28:49 Eisele: In fact, on that second check, come to think of it, there wasn't any band across the middle. It was pretty clean scope, and I think it had to do just with the respect to the Earth, how close it is to the direction you're looking. [Long pause]
108:29:05 Evans: I understand. [Long pause]
108:29:21 Evans: Donn, ...
108:29:23 Eisele: Yes.
108:29:24 Evans: ... we never got the sunset - the sunset part of that first star count thing there. If it's convenient in your log, we'll take that. [Long pause]
108:29:39 Eisele: Roger. I understand you did not get the data on the first one.
108:29:42 Evans: We got the suartse part of it, but not the sunset part of it. [Pause]
108:29:51 Eisele: Roger. At sunset, we had thinning going on, and it wiped it out completely. [Pause]
108:30:00 Evans: O, I see. Okay.
108:30:02 Eisele: There are so many fireflies, snow flakes, out there I couldn't see - tell the stars from the flakes. [Pause]
108:30:10 Evans: I understand.

Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 108 hours, 32 minutes, very good voice quality that time. Apollo 7 split the ring'of acquisition on ascension pass almost directly overhead at Ascension. Donn Eisele gave a very good report on the daylight start [should be "star"] count, reported that he got a solid 8 hours sleep and that despite the head cold, he feels pretty good. The next station to acquire will be the Tracking Ship Mercury at 109 hours. This is Mission Control, Houston.""This is Apollo Control. We are now 109 hours into the mission. The spacecraft has just been acquired over the tracking ship Mercury and the Cap Com is putting in a call to the crew.
MERCURY (REV 69)
109:00:41 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston through Mercury. stanad by. [Pause]
109:00:46 Eisele: Roger. Houston, Apollo 7.
109:00:49 Evans: Roger. Loud and clear.
109:00:52 Eisele: Well, I put a short voice recording on the tape about - it was at 108:44. [Pause]
109:01:01 Evans: Roger. Copy.
109:01:03 Eisele: That's give or take a few seconds [garble] I think it was about 108:33:40 actually, but that's the nearest minute. [Pause]
109:01:12 Evans: Roger. [Long pause]
109:02:05 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
109:02:09 Eisele: Go aheed.
109:02:12 Evans: Roger. Donn, do you have time to give us a little run down where you found out the best place to sleep is? [Pause]
109:02:22 Eisele: Yes. We're still sleeping under the couches in space, and that seems to work out best. We've tried free floating and tried keeping strapped down in the sleeping bags, and the latter seems to be better off. I think you can also sleep in the couches if you're strapped down, I guess, but if there's more than one person [garble] you're kind of in the way. The only problem with sleeping under the couch - at least on the right side; I haven't checked the left, but I know on the right - it tends to get hot under there for some reason; not hot, but a little warmer than the rest of the spacecraft. I dont think there's much air circulation. [Long pause]
109:03:06 Evans: Roger. Thank you, Donn. We copied. [Long pause]
109:03:37 Evans: Apollo 7, Houston.
109:03:40 Eisele: Hey, good morning.
109:03:42 Evans: Mr Eisele.
109:03:45 Eisele: That's right.
109:03:47 Evans: Donn, what's the word - what's the configuation of your window shades when you have both of them asleep? Do you have most of your window shades up? [Pause]
109:03:55 Eisele: Negative. We haven't even pulled them out of the can the whole flight.
109:03:58 Evans: Okay.
109:04:00 Eisele: It doesn't seem to be a problem when you are asleep; you just try to bury your head under something down under the couch, and you don't even notice the sunlight much. [Pause]
109:04:10 Evans: Okay. Let me ask you one other question. Sack this out: what about with respect to that telescope and stars in the daytime; can you ascertain anything at all until you're past the terminator out of the telescope? [Long pause]
109:04:30 Eisele: No, we started out to - you mean coming into sunset? [Pause]
109:04:40 Evans: Yes, in other words, doing a P51 during daytime. [Pause]
109:04:45 Eisele: Roger. If you lucked out and it happened to end up with the optics pointed at the optimum position - that's, in other words, well away from the Earth and also well away from the Sun - I believe that, say 5 to 10 minutes from sunset or sunrise, you probably could see it. That's last night, at that one setting, [garble] in there, I could have done an alignment; but the problem of the P51 is that we don't have an alignment to start with, and you don't know how to point the thing. [Long pause]
109:05:16 Evans: Yes. All right. Real fine. [Pause]
109:05:20 Eisele: [Garble] got, if you already had an alignment, you'd just rather do a fine align; you can do that okay. [Garble] and I have seen a number of stars in the sextant during daylight. [Long pause]
109:05:37 Evans: Okay.

This is Mission Control. We've lost contact now with the spacecraft as it moved over the horizon and out of range of the Guam tracking station. We had overlapping coverage at that pass from the Mercury and the station at Guam, spacecraft passing almost directly overhead both stations. We will be acquiring again in just about 20 minutes at the Redstone in the South Pacific. Here in Mission Control Center at the present time we're in the midst of a change of shift of Flight Director Gene Kranz who will be going off and who will be replaced on the flight director console by Gerry Griffin and at the CapCom position we'll have astronaut Bill Pogue taking over from Ron Evans. At 109 hours, 14 minutes into the mission, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 109 hours, 32 minutes. I have just put in a call to the crew, and we pick up conversations over the Redstone.

109:32:22 Stafford: Roger. Reading you about three-by, Donn. [Pause]
109:32:28 Eisele: [Garble] got both hands full and the mike slipped. Is that better? [Pause]
109:32:34 Stafford: Say again slower; I couldn't read you. [Pause]
109:32:40 Eisele: All right. Disregard. [Long pause]
109:33:09 Stafford: Apollo 7, Houston. How do you read? [Pause]
109:33:13 Eisele: Loud and clear.
109:33:15 Stafford: Okay. You're coming in loud and clear. While we have some quiet time, I would just like to ask you a couple more of questions, Donn. When you're in the local horizontal attitude, can you observe the horizons out the rendezvous windows below you? [Long pause]
109:33:34 Eisele: You mean how far below the X-axis can you see?
109:33:37 Stafford: Yes.
109:33:40 Eisele: I don't know. I've newer been precisely in that attitude to look. I don't believe you can, though. [Pause]
109:33:45 Stafford: Okay. Well look. one ...
109:33:46 Eisele: [Garble] I'm not shure, Tom, we haven't really done any precise local horizontal maneuvers yet. [Pause]
109:33:54 Stafford: Okay. Well. down the line in the next day or so, if you get a chance, I wish you would do that so we can get our simulators calibrated. And, also, out the side windows - the 1 and 5 window when you're in local horizontal - if you will just make a pencil makk there, we can then get our simulators calibrated to that. [Long pause]
109:34:12 Eisele: Okay. A good time to do that may be in the land mark tracking, because we'll be lined up with local horizontal anyway. [Pause]
109:34:20 Stafford: Okay. If you can, just make a note of that and check because it will sure help us on getting these - you know, quantative data for the simulators and also to pass on to the other crews. [Pause]
109:34:29 Eisele: Okay. Will do. Incidentally, the optics of the simulator are pretty realistic. What I'm seeing through these optics in here are almost identical with respect to star visibility so on. [Long pause]
109:34:42 Stafford: Oh, okay. Particularly with the telescope, what we see in the telescope is about what you've got there in flight, Donn. [Pause]
109:34:49 Eisele: That's exactly right. You have to keep your eyeball in there for several minutes before you can begin to see any stars. [Pause]
109:34:56 Stafford: I see.
109:34:57 Eisele: [Garble] using the telescope.
109:34:58 Stafford: Okay.
109:34:59 Eisele: [Garble] out the windows.
109:35:01 Stafford: Okay. That is even at nighttime too, huh?

This is Mission Control. We've lost communications now with the spacecraft. The spacecraft has gone over the horizon and out of touch with the Tracking Ship Redstone. We continue to have very good communications on that pass as we have in the last several passes. All of them have been almost directly overhead. This one - a little off to the south, actually, of the tracking ship. The first part of that pass, you heard Don Eisele advise Tom Stafford who is sitting in at the CapCom position along with astronaut Bill Pogue here in Mission Control Center. He found the optics on the spacecraft to be very simular to what he experienced in the ground based simulators at Cape Kennedy and here in Houston. In the way of logistics information we expect that we will be having a change of shift press conference in about 10 minutes in the Building I news center. The next station that will be acquiring the spacecraft - will be the Ascension station and we anticipate we will be recording that pass and subsequent passes.We will play those back following the press conference. At 109 hours, 42 minutes, this is Apollo Control.

This is Apollo Control at 110 hours 37 minutes. We've had a relatively quiet period here at the Mission Control Center since the Press Conference began. One short pass so far, that was over the tracking station on Ascension and we'll play that one back for you in its entirety now and stand by for conversation with the Mercury. The spacecraft just coming into acquisition at Mercury at this time.
And that's the substance of communications with Astronaut Don Eisele over the Ascension tracking station. It doesn't appear that we are going to get acquisition from the tracking ship Mercury. That pass goes down, just touches the edge of the acquisition circle and we are apparently out of range of communications there. In that previous pass over Ascension, you heard Don Eisele advise that Commander Wally Schirra and Lunar Module Pilot Walt Cunningham went to sleep at about 106 hours into the mission, that would have been roughly 2½ hours ago and we do anticipate that they will be able to get at least a full eight hours of sleep. The medic also reports that all of our biomedical instrumentation appears to be working well at this time. The next station to acquire the spacecraft will be the tracking ship Redstone and that acquisition is scheduled at 111 hours 5 minutes ground elapsed time, roughly 34 minutes from now. At 110 hours 39 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
This is Mission Control Center at 111 hours, 6 minutes into the flight. The Apollo 7 spacecraft is presently approaching a Tracking Ship Redstone in the midst of a night side pass during the end of the seventy first revolution. We'll standby for a call to the crew via the Redstone.

111:07:05 Pogue: Say, I have a procedure here an this television operation which I'm just gonna pass up so you don't need to write it down. It's pretty simple. It involves a technique to get the best TV picture, and it sort of goes like this. When holding the TV, duaring the next TV period, take a look at the position of the AL switch and report the position. That's probably before you start taking the television pictures. Then about onehalf way through, during the period of television, change the position of this AL switch. The AL stands for auto light, although it isn't automatic. [Long pause]
111:07:59 Eisele: Okay. I got you.
111:08:00 Pogue: And...
111:08:02 Eisele: Using the AL light.
111:08:04 Pogue: All right. They will be coordinating with you from the ground. Also, another point, it takes the TV about 90 seconds to warm up, about a mimute and a half to warm up. [Long pause]
111:08:18 Eisele: I see. Okay. We'll keep that in mind.
111:08:21 Pogue: Right. Thank you. [Long pause]
111:08:41 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. We would like to turn the O2 tank fans on for 5 minutes and then off. I'll remind you just about LOS. [Long pause]
111:08:56 Eisele: Roger. [Long pause]
111:09:17 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. I may have passed that up incorrectly. If I said OFF, it should be ON. Turn them on for 5 minutes and then off. [Pause]
111:09:25 Eisele: Roger. I got you; keep going now.
Comm break.
111:11:47 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Say, Donn, we're not getting anything on the BIOMED. Have you changed anything? [Pause]
111:11:57 Eisele: Roger. I'll have it on in a couple of minutes.
111:12:00 Pogue: Okay. Thank you. [Long pause]
111:12:11 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Opposite omni, please. Also, I have a little bit more information on that television. That AL stands for automatic light control. It's similar to automatic gain control in an electronic circuit, apparently, and it prevents a bright light source from sort off washing out the picture.
Comm break.
111:13:25 Eisele: Roger. Go and understand.
111:13:27 Pogue: Thank you. [Long pause]
111:14:06 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up on LOS; Canaries at36. [Pause]
111:14:14 Eisele: Roger. Read you. [Pause]
111:14:19 Pogue: And you can turn the number 2 CRYO fan back off. [Pause]
111:14:25 Eisele: Roger.
Very long comm break.
And we have lost of signal with the spacecraft over the Redstone. The next station to acquire will be the Canary Islands in about 22 minutes from now. This will be the first contact over the Canaries in sometime as the spacecraft orbit begins to swing back toward the northern part of the western hemisphere and towards the - high coverage we got on our state side passes. At 111 hours, 15 minutes into the mission, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control 111 hours, 36 minutes into the mission. The spacecraft is now coming upon the Canary Islands Tracking Station coming out of darkness and into daylight as the cremenator, the line that separates the light and the day and the night periods on the surface of the Earth begins to move over toward the states. And we'll be acquiring the spacecraft shortly from Canaries. We'll standby for a call to the crew.
CANARY (REV 71)
111:36:15 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. [Pause]
111:36:19 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7.
111:36:21 Pogue: Roger. Through Canary I have a request. I would like a reading on pyro batt A, B, and batt C. [Long pause]
111:36:34 Eisele: Roger. Batt C is 36.0 volts. [Pause]
111:36:44 Pogue: 36.0.
111:36:47 Eisele: Stand by far the pyros.
111:36:48 Pogue: Roger. [Long pause]
111:37:20 Eisele: Bill, I'm reading 37.0 volts for both pyros. [Pause]
111:37:24 Pogue: Roger. 37.0. In that position are you leaving the DC indicatar? [Pause]
111:37:33 Eisele: Oh, it varies. I usually leave it on one of the main bus voltages. [Pause]
111:37:37 Pogue: Good. That is what we'd like, main A or main B. [Pause]
111:37:41 Eisele: Roger.
111:37:42 Pogue: Thank you. [Long pause]
111:38:02 Eisele: Hey, Bill.
111:38:04 Pogue: Roger.
111:38:06 Eisele: Ask the tower if they've got a recomended flap setting, too. [Pause]
111:38:11 Pogue: Okay, will, and you might check the friction in the throtlle there. [Pause]
111:38:16 Eisele: Roger. (Laughter) [Pause]
111:38:26 Pogue: When I shake the stick mobile, you've got it. [Pause]
111:38:35 Eisele: It says use plenty.

111:42:18 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Canary; Honeysuckle at 23. [Pause]
111:42:27 Eisele: Roger. Honeysuckle at 23.
111:42:30 Pogue: Roger.
111:42:31 Eisele: Do you want S-band up far that?
111:42:34 Pogue: (Laughter) Roger. S-band up for that one. [Pause]
111:42:39 Eisele: Okay.Right.
Very long comm break.
This is Mission Control. The spacecraft has now gone over the hill and out of acquisition from Canary Islands. The next station to acquire will be another one that we - haven't passed over for sometime. That will be Honeysuckle on - the eastern part of Australia. As you PAO heard in that pass, a bit of light hearted conversation between Don Eisele and the ground, Eisele, requesting a flap setting which of course refers to aerodynamic flight in the aircraft and the Earth's atmosphere. Our indications here in Mission Control Center are that everything continues to function well with the spacecraft. There are no problems at this time. This is Apollo Control at 111 hours, 46 minutes into the mission.
This is Apollo Control at 112 hours, 23 minutes into the mission. The Apollo 7 spacecraft has just crossed just over the northeastern edge of the Australian continent and is just barely within range of Honeysuckle. We don't anticipate any conversation with the crew on this pass. However, CapCom Bill Pogue is putting in a call. And we'll standby to see if we get a response from Don Eisele.
HONEYSUCKLE (REV 71)
112:23:23 Pogue: Apo]lo 7, Houston through Honeysuckle. [Pause]
112:23:32 Pogue: Bill. [Pause]
112:23:42 Pogue: Okay.
Very long comm break.
And it doesn't appear that we will hear from the spacecraft on this pass over Honeysuckle. However, we should have very communications on the upcoming pass over the Redstone Tracking Ship. Here in Mission Control Center it has been a very quiet evening as it has also been aboard the spacecraft and very little scheduled on the Flight Plan for the next 4 hours as Commander Wally Schirra and LM pilot Walt Cunningham are now about 4 - 4 and 1/2 hours into their sleep period. The next major activity for the crew following breakfast will be actinese connected with a minimum impulse SPS service propulsion system burn. And in about 6 hours from now, they should begin powering up some of the spacecraft equipment associated with that burn, such as the guidance and navigation system and the stabilization and control system with the burn scheduled about 2 hours after that. At 112 hours, 27 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 112 hours 39 minutes. The spacecraft is now coming upon the Redstone tracking ship in the South Pacific. This is in the middle of the nightside pass and Cap Com Bill Pogue advises that he anticipates most of this pass over the Redstone and the subsequent pass over Antigua will be taken up by passing up a flight-plan update to Donn Eisele aboard Apollo 7. We just put in a call to the spacecraft, we'll stand by.
REDSTONE (REV 71)
112:39:56 Pogue: Apollo 7. Houston through Redstone. I have a Flight Plan update when you're ready to copy. [Long pause]
112:40:08 Eisele: Roger. Houston, go ahead with your flight update. Also would like to enter map update when you get through with this one. [Pause]
112:40:18 Pogue: Roger. I'll give you a map update as soon I get through with the Flight Plan. [Long pause]
112:40:29 Eisele: Bill, would you log me 40 clicks with the water pistol and two aspirin, please? [Pause]
112:40:38 Pogue: How many clicks?
112:40:39 Eisele: 40.
112:40:41 Pogue: Roger. Forty clicks on the water and two aspirins. [Pause]
112:40:46 Eisele: In 4 hours. [Pause]
112:40:53 Pogue: The Flight Plan update will start at 115 plus 10. CMC power up. [Long pause]
112:41:14 Eisele: Roger.
112:41:16 Pogue: Okay. You can delete the reference to CMC power up at 117 pins 20. [Long pause]
112:42:00 Eisele: [Garble].
112:42:03 Pogue: Roger. At 118 plus 00, add fuel cell O2 purge, also unstow and set up TV. That's at 118 plus 00 hours. [Long pause]
112:42:29 Eisele: Roger. [Pause]
112:42:33 Pogue: Next item is at 119 plus 04. TV ON. [Pause]
112:42:42 Eisele: Roger. TV ON at 119 04. Do you want us to turn it on 90 seconds before that, and let it warm up, or is that the turnon time you want? [Long pause]
112:43:03 Pogue: Roger. That'll take care of it. The Texas AOS is 119 plus 06, Texas acquisition at 119 plus 06, and sorry to interrupt, but we need oposite omni. [Long pause]
112:43:17 Eisele: Roger. [Long pause]
112:43:42 Pogue: And, Donn, you can let me know when you're ready to resume copy of Flight Plan update. [Pause]
112:43:48 Eisele: Roger. I'm all ready.
112:43:50 Pogue: Okay. At 119 plus 30, SCS attitude reference check previously scheduled at 89 hours and 50 minutes, 89 plus 50. That's just for information. And we'd like that SCS attitude reference check starting at 119 plus 30 at 30-minute intervals up to the time of the burn. [Long pause]
112:44:33 Eisele: Roger. You want that at 30-minute intervals to burn time. [Pause]
112:44:37 Pogue: So if you want to, make a tick at 120 plus 00 and 120 plus 30. [Long pause]
112:45:08 Eisele: Okay.
112:45:09 Pogue: Okay. The notation is 121 hours in reference to SPS burn 4; the time is 120 plus 43. [Long pause]
112:45:28 Eisele: Roger. Understand that you're going to burn at 120 plus 43. [Pause]
112:45:32 Pogue: Roger. And over there in the box where it says two-jet ullage , you can write in quads Bravo and Delta, quads B and D. [Long pause]
112:45:46 Eisele: Roger. We got you on that.
112:45:48 Pogue: Roger. And you can delete the line in reference to initiate battery charging. [Pause]
112:45:58 Eisele: Okay. Got that.
112:46:00 Pogue: Delete the half box in reference to the star count test there, the telescope star count test, sun line of sight, et cetera. [Long pause]
112:46:13 Eisele: Roger.
112:46:15 Pogue: Under the line where it says MCC update, add "For landmark tracking." You will receive an update for landmark tracking at that time. [Long pause]
112:46:36 Eisele: Understand landmark tracking update.
112:46:39 Pogue: Roger. And at 121 plus 20, P52 option 3. [Long pause]
112:46:51 Eisele: Roger. [Pause]
112:46:55 Pogue: At 121 plus 40, state vector voice update. [Long pause]
112:47:08 Eisele: You say state vector voice updtate?
112:47:10 Pogue: Affirmative.
112:47:12 Eisele: What's that for?
112:47:14 Pogue: Stand by. That's for the landmark tracking, in case you need it. [Pause]
112:47:23 Eisele: Can't you uplink' it?
112:47:26 Pogue: If required. That's in case you need it for the landmark tracking, it's not ... Roger. In case anything happens during the landmark tracking, you'll have a state vector to fall back on. [Long pause]
112:47:47 Eisele: Oh, I get you.
112:47:50 Pogue: Okay. You can delete the reference to the star count test 3 at 122 hours. Apolo 7, we're coming up on LOS Redstone. I'll pick you up at Antigua for the rest of the Flight Plan update. [Long pause]
112:48:12 Eisele: Roger.
112:48:15 Pogue: Antigua at 58.
112:48:16 Eisele (onboard): Antigua at 58; understand.
112:48:28 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. If you're still reading, the map update is REV 72, node 112 plus 56 plus 50, 74.9 degrees west.
Very long comm break.
This is Mission Control. We've lost contact with the spacecraft over Redstone and will acquire again in about 10 minutes from the Antigua station. This is Apollo Control at 112 hours 49 minutes.
This is Mission Control. The Apollo 7 spacecraft is now coming upon the Antigua Tracking Station at 112 hours, 58 minutes into the mission. We'll standby for the call up to the crew and the remainder of this Flight Plan update which CapCom Bill Pogue was in the process of passing up when we lost acquisition with the Redstone.

112:59:06 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston through Antigua. [Pause]
112:59:12 Eisele: Roger. Houston.
112:59:13 Pogue: Roger. I'll go ahead with the Flight Plan update. Before I start, did you read the map update? [Pause]
112:59:23 Eisele: I got as far as REV 72 and 112 plus 56. [Pause]
112:59:28 Pogue: Okay. REV 72, 112 plus 56 plus 50, nodal crossing at 74.9 west. [Long pause]

113:00:05 Eisele: Roger. Go.
113:00:07 Pogue: Roger. At 122 hours, delete the three references, H2 heaters ON, telescope star count, and fuel cell purge. Add. at 122 hours, 222 ORB NAV (except marks). At 122 plus 20, P23 update, star and gimbal angles.:+:+:-:-:-
113:01:01 Eisele: Roger. At 112 plus 20, you got a P - what happened at 122? What did. you say about the landmarks again? I didn't get that. [Long pause]
113:01:12 Pogue: Okay. That was not landmarks. Perhaps it is sufficient just to say at 122 hours P22 ORB NAV, and at 122 plus 20, P23 update. [Long pause]
113:01:35 Eisele: Does that mean you want me to do a P - orbital navigation at 122? [Pause]
113:01:40 Pogue: Affirmative. [Pause]
113:01:44 Eisele: Now let's - okay. I don't get it. You want me to do an ORB NAV from 122 on to sometime, and also duaring that period, you are going to be reading updates to us? [Long pause]
113:02:03 Pogue: Well, at 122 plus 20, there will be a P23 update star and gimbal angles. [Pause]
113:02:13 Eisele: Okay. I figure that might be better off a little later after we get done with my orbital NAV. [Pause]
113:02:20 Pogue: Okay. Let's talk about it in just a minute. Let me go ahead and go through the rest of the updates. At 123 hours, delete the reference to COAS calibration. At 123 plus 30, add P23 star horizon sightings. [Long pause]
113:03:08 Pogue: You can delete the reference to the attitude control tests that occur at about 123 plus 45. [Long pause]
113:03:22 Eisele: Roger.
113:03:24 Pogue: At 124 plus 20, add G&N SCS power down, and delete the reference to P54 COAS evaluation. [Long pause]
113:03:52 Eisele: Roger, Bll.
113:03:55 Pogue: Okay.
113:03:56 Eisele: Go ahead.
113:03:58 Pogue: At 125 plus 30, delete the reference to P23. [Pause]
113:04:07 Eisele: Roger.
113:04:09 Pogue: And that is the end of the update. Let me check on this other thing. [Pause]
113:04:14 Eisele: Okay. How long of this pass is this ORB NAV supposed to take? [Pause]
113:04:19 Pogue: All right. Stand by. [Pause]
113:04:29 Pogue: The ORB NAV takes one daylight pass. [Pause]
113:04:34 Eisele: Roger. That is what what I thought.
113:04:37 Pogue: Okay. And you are thinking that the P23 update is going to catch you right in the midle there. [Pause]
113:04:43 Eisele: It shouldn't be too bad. Walt can probably write it down while we,re doing the rest of it. [Pause]
113:04:48 Pogue: Okay.
113:04:50 Eisele: How come you moved the P23 up 2 hours?. Is that to get done so we can get to bed? [Pause]
113:04:57 Pogue: Affirmative.
113:04:59 Eisele: I see.
113:05:01 Pogue: We're coming up on LOS. And one other quick item - we just want to - at the point - at the risk of belaboring a point, Donn and Wally's - correction, Wally and Wart's sleep period lasts until 116 plus 00 hours. [Pause]
113:05:08 Eisele: Roger. I got that. [Long pause]
113:05:20 Pogue: We will have Canaries at 09. [Pause]
113:05:28 Eisele: Okay. I'll see you then.
113:05:31 Pogue: Thank you.
Long comm break.
This is Mission Control. We had lost of signal from Antigua. And we will be picking up the Canary station in about - about 5 minutes from now. As you heard the sleep period for commander Wally Schirra and Walt Cunningham is scheduled to last through 116 hours. And we have been advised that they began their sleep period at about 108 hours, elapsed time which would give them a full 8 hours sleep. At 113 hours, 6 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 113 hours 10 minutes. We'll be putting in a call shortly to the spacecraft over Canaries, let's listen in on that one.
CANARY (REV 72)
113:09:52 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston through Canary. [Pause]
113:09:59 Eisele: Roger, Bill.

113:16:03 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Coming up 1 min-ute LOS Canary; Carnarvon at 46 [Pause]
113:16:10 Eisele: Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Mission Control. We had a very quiet pass that time over Canaries which is typical of most of the contacts we've had this evening with the spacecraft. This mission continues to progress very well at this point and the next station to acquire will be Carnarvon, Australia and we expect that in about 30 minutes from now. This is Apollo Control at 113 hours 18 minutes.
113:38:17 Eisele (onboard): 113 hours 37 minutes; took four pictures of southern tip of India and Ceylon.
113:38:38 Eisele (onboard): Frame numbers were 78, 79, 80, and 81, magazine F.
This is Mission Control. The Apollo 7 spacecraft is now a little more than one half way through its 72-nd revolution, some 113 hours 46 minutes after liftoff and we're coming up on the Carnarvon tracking station. We'll listen for any reports from the spacecraft as we complete this Australian pass.

113:58:17 Pogue: Hey, Donn, how you feeling? [Pause]
113:58:21 Eisele: Say again, Bill.
113:58:23 Pogue: How you feeling today?
113:58:26 Eisele: Oh, pretty fair.
113:58:27 Pogue: Good.
113:58:28 Eisele: I've got kind of a head cold, but other than that, everything's fine. [Pause]
113:58:32 Pogue: Roger. [Pause]
113:58:38 Eisele: Just sitting here doing my daily dozen.
113:58:41 Pogue: Oh, good. [Pause]
113:58:48 Eisele: That's my only chance. Those other guys get up, and they monopolize it. [Pause]
113:58:52 Pogue: Yes, I saw them on television this morning. [Pause]
113:58:59 Eisele: Say again.
113:59:00 Pogue: I saw them using the exerciser on television this morning. [Pause]
113:59:05 Eisele: Oh, is that right?
113:59:07 Pogue: Roger. Rubber-necking just like everyone else. [Pause]
113:59:11 Eisele: Right. [Long pause]
113:59:34 Pogue: Apollo 7. Houston. One minute LOS; Carnarvon at 14 - Redstone at 14. [Pause]
113:59:43 Eisele: Roger. Thought maybe we were turning around abd going the other wat for a minute.
113:59:46 Pogue: That's a pretty good trick if you can pull it off. Might wake the other fellows, though. [Pause]
113:59:54 Eisele: Right.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 114 hours and we've lost contact now with the spacecraft over Honeysuckle and that was one of our more lively passes as far as conversation with Donn Eisele who is the only crewmember who's awake at the present time. Commander Wally Schirra and Lunar Module Pilot Walt Cunningham are now into their 6th hour of sleep period which began at 108 hours elapsed time and scheduled to end in about 2 more hours. You heard Eisele report that he has consumed 24 clicks of water, that figures out to just about 12 ounces since his last report from one and one-half hours ago. Donn also reported that he's feeling pretty fair with the exception of the headcold and also indicated that he gets his chance on the in-flight exerciser while his other two crewmembers are getting their sleep. We'll be picking up the spacecraft again in about 14 minutes, 13 minutes over the tracking ship Redstone at 114 hours 02 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 114 hours 14 minutes. The spacecraft Apollo 7 is now about midway through it's nightside pass and coming up on the tracking ship Redstone. We'll listen in as the Cap Com Bill Pogue puts in a call to the crew.
REDSTONE (REV 72)
114:14:28 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston through Redstone.
Long comm break.
114:17:41 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7.
114:17:44 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston, Go.
114:17:47 Eisele: Roger. I was just looking over this Flight Plan for the 8-hour active period. Looks like we're pretty well booked up. I guess the point I wanted to make is that the burn is to be the event of the day, and I take it that if we get behind or have any problems, we'll probably drop some of these other thing if we need to? [Long pause]
114:18:09 Pogue: Roger.
Comm break.
114:20:19 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Redstone; Bagama at 31. [Pause]
114:20:26 Eisele: Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control. That completes our pass over the Redstone. The spacecraft is now off the horizon and out of range and we'll be acquiring at Bahama in about 10 or 11 minutes. The mission continues to go very well throughout the night and here into the morning hours and we'll expect activity to pick up within the next hour or two. Beginning in about the next 40 minutes, Donn Eisele is scheduled to start powering up the Command Module computer and at about 116 hours elapsed time, his two fellow crewmen, Wally Schirra and Walt Cunningham are scheduled to end their sleep period. This is Apollo Control at 114 hours 22 minutes.
This is Apollo Control at 114 hours, 31 minutes. Apollo 7 spacecraft at the present time is passing over the isthmus of Panama and moving up toward the Bahama Tracking Station acquisition. We've been advised that that acquisition will probably be delayed about a minute. So we'll standby and pick up the call through the crew probably about 1 minute from now. The spacecraft is presently in an orbit with apogee of approximately 152 nautical miles and a perigee of about 89 nautical miles. It completes a revolution once every 89 minutes. We should be getting that call to the crew. Don Eisele who was on duty while Wally Schirra and Walt Cunningham completed their 8 hour sleep cycles. And we expect that call shortly from Bill Pogue who is CapCom here in the Mission Control Center.

114:33:22 Eisele: Roger, Houston. Apollo 7.
114:33:25 Pogue: Roger. Donn, I'd like a readout on batt C - Charlie - voltage. [Pause]
114:33:32 Eisele: Roger. That's 36 volts. [Pause]
114:33:38 Pogue: Thirty-six. Thank you. Also, Donn, I've been taking a look at the Flight Plan. And it may look a bit crowded, but we think everything could be gotten in there in the normal course of events in getting ready for the burn. However, we have looked at a couple of things here that could be deleted without affecting anything. First off, if you start getting crowded, you can scrub the photography entries, which sort of goes without saying. Second, you can scrub the SCS attitude reference check. And third, delete the P22 exercises associated with P52. [Long pause]
114:34:29 Eisele: Roger.
114:34:30 Pogue: You know, if you get in a bind. [Long pause]
114:34:41 Eisele: Yes, I think we can get through it okay, Bill. I just wanted to point out that if we do get behind and if we do have any problem we we'll probably drop them. [Pause]
114:34:49 Pogue: Roger. The point is well taken.
Long comm break.

114:44:22 Pogue: Go.
114:44:25 Eisele: Say, Bill, insteadof powering up at 115:10 and doing a P23 trunion check, I think I'd just as soon wait and do that at the time we do the start of horizon landmark business - start of horizon navigation. [Long pause]
114:44:42 Pogue: Roger.
114:44:44 Eisele: In other words, I don't see any point in powering and maneuvering around to do one lettle check ... [Pause]
114:44:48 Pogue: Right.
114:44:49 Eisele: ... when it would be easier to do the same thing a little later - catch them all at the same time. Probably.
Comm break.
114:46:32 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. Regarding the power up at the latter time: just before the new state vector is agreeable here. [Long pause]

Very long comm break.
This is Apollo Control at 114 hours, 53 minutes into the mission. We've just completed a pass over the Canary Island station and there was a small amount of conversation with the spacecraft on that pass which we will now play pack for you in its entirity."PAO">"This is Apollo Control at 115 hours 18 minutes into the mission. The spacecraft is due to be acquired shortly by the Carnarvon tracking station and here in Mission Control Center, activity is beginning to pick up a little bit after a very quiet night. We'll be shortly getting ready for the days activities and onboard the spacecraft we would expect that Donn Eisele would, within the next 25 or 30 minutes, begin powering up the Command Module computer in preparation for that fourth service propulsion system burn. And, Cap Com Bill Pogue now has just put in a call to the crew, we'll listen in.

This is Mission Control 116 hours into the flight of Apollo 7. The spacecraft is presently approaching the Texas tracking station at Corpus Christi. Will be coming within range of that station and simultaneously will be coming out of a nightside pass and into daylight. We'll be acquiring the spacecraft shortly and we would expect that Wally Schirra and Walt Cunningham will also be ending their sleep periods shortly having gotten about eight hours of sleep this time. They're scheduled to be awaking shortly if they are not already up. We'll stand by now as Cap Com Bill Pogue puts in a call to the crew.

This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal now with the spacecraft moving out over the Atlantic Ocean toward the Canary Islands. During that pass you heard Cap Com Bill Pogue pass up the GO to the spacecraft for another days flight through rev. 92 and Donn Eisele reported that he had taken another 30 clicks of water which makes his total now something on the order of about 20 ounces during the past several hours. We'll be acquiring the station at the Canary Islands, acquisition coming up at elapsed time of 116 hours 17 minutes, that will be about 2 minutes from now and we'll pick up the spacecraft again at that point. At 116 hours 16 minutes this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control. The spacecraft will shortly be coming into acquisition at Canary Islands, CapCom Bill Pogue just put in a call. We'll standby for any conversation from the crew.
CANARY (REV 74)

Long comm break.
116:23:28 Pogue: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Canary; Carnarvon at 52. [Pause]
116:23:36 Unidentifiable crewmember: Roger.
Very long comm break.
This is Mission Control. The spacecraft is now gone out of range of the Canary Island Tracking Station. And we will be picking the spacecraft up again in about - about 26 minutes from now at 116 hours, 52 minutes, ground clasped time over the Canarvon, Australia Tracking Station. At 116 hours, 25 minutes, this is Apollo Control.
This is Apollo Control at 116 hours, 45 minutes into the flight of Apollo 7. At the present time here in the Mission Control Center, we are in the midst of a shift change. The prime Flight Director, Glenn Lunney, is in the control center and will shortly be relieving Flight Director Gerry Griffin. Also, our CapCom coming up will be Jack Swigert who will be replacing Bill Pogue at the CapCom position. During the night and into the early morning, the Apollo 7 mission continued to progress very well. It was almost a quiet and uneventful period. A short time ago, Gerry Griffin pulled the flight controllers here in the center and passed along a goal to the crew for 92-1, an additional 16 revolutions carrying them through an additional day. The major activity during the evening had the major commander Wally Schirra and LM pilot Walt Cunningham sleeping. Donn Eisele was tending the store and passed up the flight update which will include a TV pass with acquisition expected at about 9:09 am this morning. From the Corpus Christi site, the crew has been instructed to turn on the television some 2 minutes from that to give things time to warm up. A little later on at - about 120 hours, 43 minutes elapsed time, we have the fourth SPS service propulsion system burn scheduled. This will be a minimum impulse burn with an anticipated duration of about 1/2 second, imparting about 15 feet per second velocity - additional velocity to the spacecraft. And shortly the crew will begin powering up the Command Module computer. And they are getting set up for that burn. We haven't yet heard from Wally Schirra and Walt Cunningham. They were scheduled to be waking up a short while ago. And we anticipate we will hear from them during the next spacecraft acquisition about 5 minutes from now and when acquire at Carnarvon. Donn Eisele reported that he was doing - well. He said to report that he felt pretty fair. He said he still had a head cold, but otherwise was feeling fine and was doing his daily dozen in exercise on the inflight exerciser. The crew all appeared to have gotten a good night's sleep. I anticipate that Schirra and Cunningham got at least 8 hours and the same for Eisele. As far as the weather goes, we are continuing to watch tropical storm Gladys near the western tip of Cuba. Otherwise, the weather and all of the other recovery areas - all recovery areas and premature throughout the world appears to be pretty good at this point. We will be acquiring spacecraft now over Carnarvon coming up at 116 hours, 52 minutes, elapsed time. At 116 hours, 48 minutes; this is Apollo Control.

116:53:33 Eisele: Go ahead, Houston.
116:53:35 Swigert: Good morning, Donn. How are you this morning.
116:53:38 Eisele: Oh, just fine, Jack. Just had a flight with this computer here. [Pause]
116:53:42 Swigert: Roger. Donn, would like to get a battery C voltage readout here at Carnarvon. [Pause]
116:53:52 Cunningham: Roger. Battery C is showing 36.5, and good morning, Jack. [Pause]
116:53:57 Swigert: Good morning, Walt, and how are you? [Pause]
116:54:01 Cunningham: Fine.
116:54:02 Swigert: And we're going to be sending you a state vector and target load over Texas, and I'll have the memeuver PAD and NAV check to pass up to you. [Long pause]
116:54:14 Cunningham: Roger. At the same time?
116:54:16 Swigert: Roger. And one other thing I wanted to discuss with you here at this time is the TV went over so well yesterday, we'd like to know if you could save one of your breakfast packages to demonstrate eating on television this morning? [Long pause]
116:54:43 Cunningham: We'll give them something interesting, but we'll probably be mostly through breakfast by then. If we have any food left, we will eat it for the audience. [Pause]
116:54:52 Swigert: Okay. Would appreciate it if you could do it. [Pause]
116:54:56 Cunningham: We're going to eat - we're starting our breakfast now, Jack, and we're not going to want to schedule things around that TV cemera. [Pause]
116:55:03 Swigert: Okay. Understand.
Comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston. I'm having a little trouble getting the plug in the right hole. At 116 hours, 55 minutes into the flight, the crew seems to be waking up over Carnarvon. We have this conversation going on.
116:56:38 Cunningham: What's the news this morning, Jack? [Pause]
116:56:42 Swigert: I'm getting it summarized now. Will be passing it up to you in a little bit. We'll pick up Honeysucle here. Walt, at 117:00. You want to turn up your S-band? [Long pause]
116:56:55 Cunningham: 117:00. We'll turn up the S-band.
116:56:57 Swigert: Roger.
Comm break.
116:58:02 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Looks like your primary evaporator is drying out again. [Pause]
116:58:09 Cunningham: You know, that thing runs fine all night long until you guys come on. [Pause]
116:58:15 Swigert: Maybe it's me. [Pause]
116:58:19 Cunningham: That started down this pass, didn't it? [Long pause]
116:58:42 Schirra: Jack, about that: Walt's just come on, too.
116:58:45 Swigert: Good morning, Wally. Could we get you to set down the primary evaporator to go to DECREASE on the back pressure switch? And do not reservice it at this time. [Long pause]
116:58:59 Eisele: You want another increase, don't you? I'm shutting it down, now.
116:59:02 Swigert: Excuse me. INCREASE on the back pressure swich. [Pause]
116:59:06 Eisele: That's in work. Whenever it dried out, I go ahead and close it up. You don't want it reserviced now? [Pause]
116:59:12 Swigert: That is affirmative. [Long pause]
116:59:23 Swigert: What we would like to do is have the reservice take place 117 plus 15. [Long pause]
116:59:36 Eisele: Roger. Is that to be over a station, or do you just want me to write it down? [Pause]
116:59:41 Swigert: You can do it on your own.
116:59:44 Eisele: Okay. I'll give it 2 minutes of water at 117:15.
Very long comm break.
117:07:00 Cunningham (onboard): 10 clicks of water for LMP.
117:14:19 Cunningham (onboard): On the sausage patties on the first series, I did not get enough water in it and could not eat it. This time I doubled the water supply [garble] and it looks eatable.

117:33:38 Swigert: That is affirmative. I have the morning news for you. [Pause]
117:33:45 Cunningham: Go ahead.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, 117 hours, 33 minutes into the flight. Among other things we have planned today, is the minimum impulse burn of the service propulsion engine. It will be on the order of one-half of a second, just a blip. The Delta-V is estimated at around 14 - 15 feet per second. The burn will be done in plane and it will have a very, very slight effect on the apogee/perigee, the resulting number should be something like 94 by 160. Here's the conversation that's going on with the crew by Guaymas.
117:33:48 Cunningham: GO ahead. We're all on.
117:33:51 Swigert: Apollo 7, before that, could we get you to go to ACCEPT, so we'll send up your target load and state vector? [Pause]
117:34:01 Cunningham: Roger. We're drinking our mornining coffee.
117:34:04 Swigert: Roger. The Supreme Court acts of yesterday now assuare that all 50 states will have three candidates to pick from for the November election. The headlines this morning says, "Apollo 7 Sails On." And there is a picture of Harriet Eisele watchin the TV pass from the viewing room here at MCC. And at the Olympics, Al Herter became the first athlete in history to win a fourt gold medal. He has won the discus event in every Olympics since 1966, and that's about it from friendly newscaster. [Long pause]
117:34:52 Eisele: Thank you, Jack. I aprectate that. Thanks, Jack.
117:34:55 Swigert: Roger.
117:34:57 Cunningham: It seems like Mr. Herter is a very durable athlete.
117:35:00 Swigert: He sure is.

117:47:09 Schirra: Roger. See you then.
Long comm break.
This is Apollo Control, Houston at 117 hours and 50 minutes. I'm not sure it went out over the loop, but we got a report in the course of that pass from our Corpus Christi station that the television converter, a vital instrument that converts the signal received from the spacecraft to a seeable image, is down. It's in a red condition, and right now they're estimating it will take several - 13 30 is the estimate in GET, and we're showing 12 hours 54 minutes. That's about a - something on the order of 40 minutes to get it fixed. They are feverishly working and trying to fix it coming up on this next pass, which is programmed as the television pass, and of course it's from Corpus that we've seen such high quality pictures over the last two days. We'll watch this very closely and try to keep you informed. To recap, the converter at the Texas station is down, it is in a red condition, and technicians there are working feverishly to get it in shape to receive the television pass about an hour and a half from now. Their current estimate is that the set - the converter should be in a GO configuration in about 35 minutes. At 117 hours and 52 minutes into the mission this is Apollo Control.
CANARY (REV 75)
117:52:36 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through the Canaries. Standing by. [Pause]
117:52:40 Cunningham: Roger, Jack. How come we don't have our tape running? [Pause]
117:52:45 Swigert: Stand by. [Pause]
117:52:49 Schirra: Jack, while you are there, observe our pitch rate at this time. [Pause]
117:52:54 Swigert: Okay. Stand by. I don't have that display called up, Wally. Just a minute. [Pause]
117:53:00 Schirra: This is one of those free pitch rates again.
117:53:03 Swigert: Ah so.
117:53:06 Schirra: We are pretty well convinced that this machine does not want to fly X-axis vertical, either down or up. [Pause]
117:53:13 Swigert: Copy that.
117:53:15 Schirra: And that's how we get these gimbal locks in once in a while without even suspecting it - or a lot off rapid change of attitude. I think you can see my pitch rate will start decreasing; it's in four-tenths of a degree per second, and I have no pitch in. [Long pause]
117:53:32 Swigert: Okay. I'm watching it now. [Pause]
117:53:38 Schirra: All my chanels are off. Now should I go to - you want GDC on number 1 ball; is that what it is? [Pause]
117:53:43 Swigert: Affirmative. [Pause]
117:53:47 Schirra: I'll have to align it. [Long pause]
117:54:06 Schirra: We'll give you 1620; you can watch that. [Pause]
117:54:10 Swigert: Okay. [Long pause]
117:54:38 Schirra: The computer's busy thinking the thing over. [Pause]
117:54:48 Schirra: Had a pitch rate decreasing there; don't know if you can see that.
117:54:50 Swigert: Roger. I can see that.
This is Apollo Control, Houston 117 hours 54 minutes into the flight. And again this morning, Wally Schirra notes that he is getting a slight pitch rate, a torquing effect, if you will, from the spacecraft without - hands off the controls, he notes some unusual, very slight, but unexplainable moments coming into the vehicle, just as he reported yesterday afternoon. It is worth noting that the spacecraft is at perigee. It is right over the Canary Islands, just south of the Canary Islands. Here is how the conversation is going.
117:54:54 Schirra: I didn't do a thing to it. It's not transferring, not to another; that's another point. [Pause]
117:55:02 Swigert: Okay. Copy that. [Pause]
117:55:06 Schirra: I could have blown a lot of fuel trying to do that. [Pause]
117:55:10 Swigert: Roger. Copy.
117:55:11 Schirra: But it wasn't worthwhile that we explore this one on this mission. I'm getting pitch towards zero for nothing. [Long pause]
117:55:35 Swigert: Wally, your X-axis now pointed heads down toward the Eearth? [Pause]
117:55:43 Schirra: Generally towards the Earth; that's right. We are - the S-IV - the big engine is sort of ahead of us, and our - the plus X is sort of trailing. You got the angles now. Now you notice the rates are almost stopped, and I haven't done anything to the spacecraft. [Long pause]
117:56:09 Swigert: Okay.
117:56:12 Cunningham: Can you give us a chart update when you get a chance, Jack?
117:56:14 Swigert: In work. [Long pause]
117:56:34 Swigert: Roger. Walt, I have the chart update. [Pause]
117:56:40 Cunningham: Go ahead.
117:56:41 Swigert: Okay. For REV 74, the time of the node 117 plus 23 plus 02, longitude 143.1 degrees west, right ascension of 04 plus 34. [Long pause]
117:57:06 Schirra: Jack, now notice this, zero yaw rate, zero pitch rate. [Pause]
117:57:14 Cunningham: I got 117 plus 23 plus 02, 143.1 west, and 04 plus 33 right ascension. [Pause]
117:57:23 Swigert: Roger. [Long pause]
117:57:38 Cunningham: Hey, Jack. Frame 86, magazine S: ground formation over the western end of Africa. [Long pause]
117:57:56 Cunningham: You read, Jack?
117:57:58 Swigert: Roger. Walt, we are about 15 second LOS Canaries; Tananarive at 118 plus 21. [Pause]
117:58:02 Cunningham (onboard): Roger.

Very long comm break.
117:58:07 Cunningham (onboard): A ground formation, west end of Africa.
117:58:51 Cunningham (onboard): At about 116:20, magazine S, frame 86, taken over the desert, the western end of Africa, a ground formation just past the Canaries.
117:59:08 Cunningham (onboard): Correction on that time - it was 117 hours 57 minutes and 30 seconds.
This is Apollo Control, 118 hours, 11 minutes into the flight. Earlier we mentioned the converter problem at our Corpus Christi station. Corpus now estimates the converter will be up and running in about 20 minutes. In other words to support the pass. We are about to contact through Tananarive; there goes the first call.
(GOSS NET 1) TANANARIVE (REV 75)
118:11:21 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston through Tananarive.
118:11:23 Schirra (onboard): Go ahead.
118:11:33 Schirra: Houston, Apollo 7. We read you.
118:11:36 Swigert: Roger. Wally, we have been doing some looking into this torque business; there have been some calculation made that show that there is a five to tenths of a foot-pound torque possible going through perigee when you're broadside - going through perigee broadside to the direction of flight. This produces a possible rate of .03 degrees per second per second in pitch due to drag. I would like to ask you if this torquing rate that you experienced exists throughout a complete revolution, or is more pronounced - noticeable - at perigee only? [Long pause]
118:12:26 Schirra: We have already discovered it's more pronounced at perigee; we were thinking here last night going across the States and across the Atlantic, and we could see it more strongly. Had a tendency to put a pitch up; it didn't matter what the roll was. As we came across perigee, we started torquing right back, and we tended to go in RCS most of the time. [Long pause]
118:12:50 Swigert: Okay. Copy. And we do have some more information on your secondary switchover. [Long pause]
118:13:01 Cunningham: Go.
118:13:02 Swigert: Okay. Our best data for your onboard gage readings for secondary tanks switchover are as follows. Are you ready to copy? [Long pause]
118:13:14 Cunningham: Go.
118:13:16 Swigert: Okay. Quad A 46 percent; Quad B switch with tank quad D Dog; quad C Charlie 54 percent; quad D 49 percent; at present, quad C is the closest to switchover, the predicted switchover time should be approximately 140 hours GET. [Long pause]
118:13:52 Cunningham: Roger. And our meter readings are 46; Baker goes with Dog; 54 and 49 percent; we should switch over quads when they are indicating that to us? Over. [Long pause]
118:14:08 Swigert: That's affirmative, 7. [Pause]
118:14:12 Cunningham: Thank you. [Long pause]
118:14:28 Cunningham: Hey, Jack, has that corelation between our onboard readings and the actual quantities been fairly consistent - with regard to the quantities coming down? [Long pause]
118:14:44 Swigert: That's affirmative, Walt. We think the numbers we have passed you are pretty good numbers right now. [Pause]
118:14:53 Cunningham: Thank you. [Long pause]
118:15:04 Cunningham: O2 purge will be complete in 30 seconds.

This is Apollo Control, Houston 118 hours 27 minutes into the flight. We have acquired via Carnarvon reading data out of the spacecraft through that station right now. The Flight Plan activities for the next hour or so looks like this: they'll do an inertial measuring unit and realinement - that's a platform realignment between Carnarvon and Hawaii; they'll run through their minimum impulse thruster program, run it through the computer; they are to take some land photography from the New Mexico area, of the New Mexico area and the Bahamas; and our first television is scheduled at Texas acquisition, which will be 119 hours and 6 minutes, and our charts show that we should lose signal via Mila, east of Mila, at - or Merritt Island, at 119 hours 17 minutes. Immediately out over the eastern edge of Bermuda the biomed harness and switches to give us data on Donn Eisele, the Command Module pilot. We have no conversation at Carnarvon. Let's monitor the loop for any thing that might develop.
This is Apollo Control, Houston again 118 hours 29 minutes. The Corpus Christi site has changed out several parts of their converter system and without any success. I say again the Corpus converter is still down. They were estimating it would be up and ready about this time. They are going to continue to work on it. They still have about 35 minutes, and I'm sure they will work very hard. If for some reason we do not have that real time converter capability, the Texas station of course will record the signal. We'll have the tape flown to Houston and then we will see it later today. We will go ahead with as much television as we can program through the Merritt Island station, and just to recap, we have not ruled out the Texas station yet, but it does not look good. Two units of the converter were changed out in the last 35 minutes, and apparently there is something else wrong. At 118 hours 31 minutes into the flight we are standing by with the spacecraft over Carnarvon.
118:33:14 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. One minute LOS Carnarvon. Would you turn up S-band for contact with Honeysuckle? [Pause]

118:36:15 Swigert: Affirmative. We followed you all the way through 52 there, Donn. [Pause]
118:36:19 Cunningham: This is not the regular navigator. [Pause]
118:36:23 Swigert: Okay. [Pause]

This is Apollo Control, Houston 118 hours 39 minutes into the flight. And according from the last reading from our Texas station at Corpus Christi they will not be able to support the TV pass. They are still working feverishly to get their converter fixed, but it's been without any major success at this point. Thus they have to suggest that they will not be able to support the pass. However, they will be watching and recording the inbound signal at Corpus, they will be describing it to us on a separate loop; and by voice at least we will try to relay what - at least something of the quality of the picture and the state of the action as is seen from Corpus, and we should be able to see a picture at Merritt Island acquisition at which time is not yet posted, but we'll have it for you very shortly. The spacecraft has lost signal now via the Honeysuckle station in eastern Australia, and we'll come back to you at the ship Huntsville in about 15 minutes.
118:40:30 Eisele (onboard): The torquing angles are 00007, minus 00011, plus 00007. We're on VERB 6, NOUN 93 on the final line of [garble] 15.
118:40:46 Eisele (onboard): The time, 118 hours and 40 minutes.
This is Apollo Control, Houston, 118 hours, 53 minutes into the flight and we just received word from Corpus Christi that the balky converter down there this morning is green and go, it has been fixed. There are saying now they will be able to support a TV pass over Corpus on this up coming Rev across the States. We have not yet acquired through the Huntsville, we will come back to you when we do, in about S minutes. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
HAWAII through BERMUDA (REV 75)

118:56:27 Schirra: Roger. [Garble].
Long comm break.
119:04:59 Eisele: Houston, Apollo 7.
119:05:01 Swigert: Go ahead, 7.
119:05:04 Eisele: Roger. Are you receiving our program?
119:05:07 Swigert: It's not comig through yet, Donn. [Pause]
119:05:11 Eisele: Roger.
Comm break.
And we are standing by here in the Control Center, set to acquire any moment now. 119 hours and the crew is now asking if we are receiving their program and we are not. The screen is black. The screen is still black. There are some light patterns moving back and forth across it. Elapsed time 119 hours 05 minutes and we should be getting a solid signal from Corpus just any second. As reported earlier, we have had trouble with that converter this morning and we have got our fingers crossed. They reported about 20 minutes ago, they were up and ready. Now we are seeing some white lines across the screen which is the kind of thing which preceded the transmissions in the past 2 days. Donn Eisele just asked "are you picking up anything," and now Texas has acquisition, spacecraft acquisition. Still no picture, some snow. Donn Eisele reported that the crew commander has a sign which is getting heavy. Obviously in jest. Now we are beginning to see glimpses of a picture, but it's a large, washy kina of a thing with no definition of the forms. Now, we're checking antenna patterns, still no readable picture. We're now alerted, the crew is holding a sign of some sort. Guaymas has done a handover to the Texas site for data purposes, which is coming in fine. The EECOM says we should switch antennas, that might help. Picture very washy and unreadable. Just white smear through center of dark screen. We're not just sure of whether it is the converter or not, but we have had as yet no readable picture, no readable picture in the Control Center, 119 hours, 8 minutes. Among the more anxious viewers is Flo Cunningham, the wife of Walt Cunningham, and Walt's brother Bill, who is visiting here from Alaska. Now, we're getting a picture. Let's all have a look.
119:06:27 Eisele: Are you picking up anything, Jack?
119:06:29 Swigert: Not yet, Donn. We're just about to get our handover to Texas. We should be picking up shortly. [Pause]
119:06:34 Eisele: I see. Okay. We're not there yet. [Pause]
119:06:42 Eisele: Wally's complayning. He says he's got a sinus that's getting heavy. [Pause]
119:06:50 Swigert: Copy that. [Long pause]
119:07:46 Swigert: Still nothing yet, Donn. [Long pause]
119:08:02 Swigert: Apollo 7. Opposite omni. [Pause]
119:08:07 Eisele: Roger. [Long pause]
119:08:45 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Could you switch to the omni antenna in between? [Pause]
119:08:51 Eisele: Roger. [Pause]
119:08:58 Swigert: There it is; there it is.
119:09:00 Schirra: Okay.
119:09:03 Schirra: Jack, are you receiving the picture now?
119:09:05 Swigert: We're receiving the picture; it's a little bright. Could you bring it in a little? Roger. From_ the lovely Apollo Room high atop everything. [Long pause]
119:09:19 Schirra: Roger. This is your captain speaking on this flight, and you can unfasten your seat belts and relax, and we hope we can make this flight enjoyable for you. At this time, we would like to demonstrate one of our minor problems here; in fact, I should tell you what time it is. Just one moment, and we'll get a compuiter on the line here. [Long pause]
119:09:43 Cunningham: It's in ENTER now.
119:09:46 Schirra: Okay. We'll reset that. [Pause]
119:09:51 Swigert: He's getting GET up. [Pause]
119:09:56 Schirra: And we now have our time counting. It is 119 hours 9 minutes and some odd seconds into the flight. One of our problems at this time is making note of the small arrow here; we're not sure what it means in that up is not necessarily up or down, but we we'll discuss that at a later time. What you just observed was a fumbling attempt to get the keyboard working on our DSKY, which is our display keybord; and the numbers you are reading is the time generated from the onboard computer. I'd now like to show you Walt Cunningham preparing some our food at our food station. I'll bring you in close to show you what our food stations have. We have two buttons: the upper button is COLD, the lower is HOT; and there is a spout that Wally is now uncovering. When we depress the button, with the appropriate container over the silver spout, we deliver 1 ounce of water, be it hot or cold. At this time, Walt will get some of the food. One of the nice features of the food preparation on this flight is - a nice feature about the food is that we have hot water, and this this makes the food much more enjouyable and quite palatable. We are using a pair of surgical shears to cut open the upper portion of the plastic bag, and we pry open the spout, which will then interface with the tap. At this point, Walt is applying it to the tap. On this trip, we use cold water. We are reconstituting some fruit juice. You see him depress the button, and each depression supplies 1 ounce of cold water. This water is quite delightful. It's cold as hell; it's about 50 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit. At first, we were adding chlorine to the water daily to be sure there were no contaminations or bacteria that would develop in the water. This left a rather bad aftertaste. We are now adding chlorine approximately every other day.
HAWAII through ANTIGUA (REV 76)
119:12:28 Schirra: He is now adding 5 ounces of water. You may notice the bubbles that are in the bag. There's a little bit of gas in the water; this does not cause us too much problems. If you get a lot of gas it does, and we have to clean the gas back out again. Fortunately, this has not happened too often. Then, the next step is to knead the bag; this mixes the powder concentrate with the water; and then we end up with a complete drink. We may have a zero-g demonstration available for you here, where we can spin the bag, and you will notice the bubbles are sort of breaking and falling apart. They do not form a solid mass of bubbles, but you can see in the center a rather interesting formation of bubbles. [Long pause]
119:13:26 Schirra: I'd like to pass the camera now to Donn Eisele. I'd like to try to show you the problem we have with the water condensation underneath on the other panel. Here goes the camera to Donn. [Long pause]
119:13:45 Cunningham: While Wally is getting under the couch to demonstrate the suction that we use to clean up the water that has been accumulated on the cold pipes, I'll describe the systen that we do have. We have an overboard dump hose, which dumps the liquid we have in the spacecraft overboard through a heated vent; that hose has been passed to Donn, and he has a purge fitting attached to the end of it. I'm now going to go to the dump position on the waste management system, and Wally will be vacuuming up some water while Donn and I throw lighte on it. [Long pause]
119:14:37 Swigert: Apollo 7, Houston. Could you give us the position of the switch on the TV camera? [Pause]
119:14:42 Cunningham: ALC is OUT.
119:14:45 Swigert: We would like to switch that position to IN, to the ALC position. [Pause]
119:14:49 Cunningham: Roger. Is your picture satisfactory? [Pause]
119:14:53 Swigert: It's a good picture; we're trying to improve it a little. [Pause]
119:14:57 Eisele: Roger. We're trying to show you a picture of a plumbing fitting that has a lot of water on it, clinging to it. Can you see the water on the fitting? [Long pause]
119:15:09 Cunningham: Can you see the water on the fitting, Jack?
119:15:12 Swigert: We're looking; don't quite see it. [Pause]
119:15:16 Eisele: Okay. Can you see the fitting?
119:15:19 Swigert: Affirmative. Could you go back to the OUT position? [Pause]
119:15:23 Eisele: It's always worked better in the OUT position. Maybe you will see it when he starts sucking it up. [Pause]
119:15:28 Cunningham: Okay. Now he's going to suck up the water with the vacuum line we have. It's very, very small vacuum, but so far, it seems to have worked pretty well at taking water overboard. It's a pretty good size blob of water that's - yes - takes quite awhile. Are you observing that, Jack? [Long pause]
119:16:04 Swigert: Affirmative. We got you five-by. We've got about another minute and a half of picture here. [Pause]
119:16:12 Cunningham: Okay. Okay. This is part of our regular preparation for a burn now, is to clean off what water we can see because after an SPS burn it seems to end up on the aft bulkhead. This water is formed by condensing on the cold glycol lines. Donn will finish out the run by showing you the MDC in front of the comander's station. Go ahead and talk, Donn. [Long pause]
119:16:56 Eisele: All right. This is the comnander's station. The left-seat drivers controls the attitude of the spacecraft and also the operation of the main system. [Long pause]
119:17:08 Eisele: This instrument in the middle is the heart of the whole thing, really. It is called Flight Director Attitude Indicator which is comparable to the artificial horizon in an airplane, exept that it operates in all three axes instead of just two. These various switches control the configuration of the manual attitude control system. We can hold an attitude, or we can free drift. We can have two or three modes to use the handcontroller. This is the handcontroller that you use to slide the spacecraft around various attitudes manually. These switches here control the electronics and whether or not the signals get from the handcontroller out to the little jets to fire them.
There, we are LOS the spacecraft almost over Bermuda. We have lost the picture, but we saw a most interesting demonstration of space-age plumbing. Here's some more commentary.
And the TV lines have been turned down which will end our television activities for another day and we are going to have a full discussion of the light setting and some other conditions relative to the television pass. There may be additional commentary; we'll just leave the line open.
Well, all in all, we would have to say the television reception today was not up to the past 2 days and as yet, we can't put our finger on any one thing; whether it was a ground station problem or if so, where. We did see some major changes in the picture quality with the automatic light control system that was referred to as ALC was brought up and frankly I had the impression that the picture quality was better with the automatic light control button operating although we spent most of the pass with it turned off. We are only a minute from LOS through the ship Vanguard. Now we do have some commentary; let's go back.
119:17:54 Cunningham: Are you still picking up the picture, Jack?
119:17:56 Swigert: Negative. We just lost the picture. That was a real good demonstration of your little home there. [Pause]
119:18:03 Eisele: Roger. See you tomorow, same time, same station.

119:20:23 Cunningham: Oh, thank you very much, Jack.
119:20:25 Schirra: Jack, could you get a view of that water blob down there?
119:20:28 Swigert: We couldn't pick up the water itself very closely, but we saw approximately what you were vacuuming. [Pause]
119:20:37 Schirra: Okay. That's one of the areas; there are a number of them where they collect. There is one right inside where the steam duct is; I'm in there now. There's a real big blob of water. [Long pause]
119:20:50 Swigert: Roger. Copy. we'll see you at Tananarive.
